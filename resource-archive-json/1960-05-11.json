The\r\n\r\nreason is that certain major items of revenue, of\r\n\r\nwhich income tax is the outstanding example, are\r\n\r\nnot collected by regular and equal monthly\r\n\r\namounts. In the case of income tax collections,\r\n\r\nfor instance, the main harvest will be reaped\r\n\r\nduring the months of  June, July and August. The\r\n\r\nreason is that a time limit is set for the waiting\r\n\r\nof returns of income, only after which can the\r\n\r\nDepartment get down to the raising of assessments.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it does not mean that the Government\r\n\r\ndoes not continually examine each item of revenue\r\n\r\nto see whether or not its performance comes up to\r\n\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the hon. Member, I can give him two\r\n\r\nassurances. First, the revenue position for the\r\n\r\nmain items of revenue is satisfactory. Second, all\r\n\r\nefforts have been made to collect for the State\r\n\r\nrevenue due to it, so that the final outcome will\r\n\r\nbe as envisaged in the Estimates of Revenue, if\r\n\r\nnot better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we have today before the Assembly the\r\n\r\nIncome Tax (Amendment) Bill which will ensure more\r\n\r\neffective assessment and collection of income tax.\r\n\r\nDoubtless I can take it that the concern which the\r\n\r\nMember has expressed over the collection of State\r\n\r\nrevenue would be more positively expressed in the\r\n\r\nform of support for the amending Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of his question, that\r\n\r\nis, the total revenue for the first quarter of\r\n\r\n1960, I submit a table for the information of the\r\n\r\nMember.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It will, of course, be for the\r\n\r\ninformation of all Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n    Following is the table:\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n                   1960 PROVISIONAL REVENUE FIGURES -

However, in view\r\n\r\nof the prorogation of the Assembly and the\r\n\r\nbusiness at the opening session, it has been\r\n\r\nnecessary to introduce this as an urgent Bill at\r\n\r\nthis sitting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new legislation is being drafted.

The effects\r\n\r\nand ramifications of this legislation have to be\r\n\r\ncarefully studied and weighed, particularly in\r\n\r\nregard to land use, development needs and quantum\r\n\r\nof compensation. Hon.

They will not be victimized\r\n\r\nby the private landowners either by raising rents\r\n\r\nor causing them to be evicted. The increase of\r\n\r\nrents and the eviction of the farmers only enhance\r\n\r\nthe interests of the private landowners, but they\r\n\r\nare; detrimental to the immense benefits derived\r\n\r\nfrom the social production by the farmers. However\r\n\r\nfor the sake of industrial development, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary to provide sites for the building of\r\n\r\nfactories and also the building of schools and\r\n\r\nhospitals. This may give rise to a situation where\r\n\r\nthe interests of the farmers may conflict with the\r\n\r\nlong-term interests of the State, especially when\r\n\r\nthere is a need for the State to acquire land from\r\n\r\nthe private landowners. Of course, if this\r\n\r\nconflicting situation can be avoided, we will\r\n\r\ncertainly do our best to avoid it. But all of us\r\n\r\nare aware that Singapore is a small island. Sites\r\n\r\nhave been fully developed. It seems that a\r\n\r\nconflict between the interests of the farmer and\r\n\r\nthe national interests cannot be\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\navoided.

Firstly, if he were so\r\n\r\nanxious and desirous of helping the poor farmers\r\n\r\nand squatters, why did he not suspend the\r\n\r\noperation of these two clauses of the Bill when he\r\n\r\nhad the power to do so?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, the reason why the Bill has not\r\n\r\nbeen tabled for First Reading before the\r\n\r\nprorogation of this House is that unexpected\r\n\r\ndifficulties have arisen as to how to assess\r\n\r\ncompensation other than by referring it to the\r\n\r\nRent Conciliation Board. We are trying to work out\r\n\r\na procedure whereby if the straightforward formula\r\n\r\nwhich the Government uses as a basis for\r\n\r\ncompensation, and which private developers would\r\n\r\nhave to pay their squatter tenants cannot be\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily accepted by both parties,\r\n\r\nthen there must be a much more simple procedure\r\n\r\nthan a reference to the Rent Conciliation Board.\r\n\r\nIt may well be that we are unable to discover a\r\n\r\nmore simple and expeditious method. This might\r\n\r\nhave the undesirable result of increasing the\r\n\r\nalready heavy work of the Rent Conciliation Board.\r\n\r\nBut if we had up to July to do it, I think we\r\n\r\ncould have tabled the Bill for First Reading now,\r\n\r\nmove the Second Reading, Committee stage and Third\r\n\r\nReading in June. It is not July yet and the Bill\r\n\r\nis not due to expire until the 23rd of July.\r\n\r\nUnlike the last Labour Front Government which went\r\n\r\non and on and on and never knew when to stop, we\r\n\r\ndecide that once a year the Assembly should be pro\r\n\r\nrogued and we should have the House tidied up, all\r\n\r\npapers nicely bundled up for the year. Therefore,\r\n\r\nbecause the Assembly is going to be prorogued\r\n\r\nafter our sitting on 1st of June for the election\r\n\r\nof the Speaker, all Bills will die, as we do not\r\n\r\nintend to have the opening of the next session\r\n\r\nuntil some time in July itself, and then seven\r\n\r\nclear days\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nfor the debate on the Government's policy address.\r\n\r\nWe have thought it prudent thereafter to put in\r\n\r\nthis Bill by an extension of six months rather\r\n\r\nthan inconvenience the House in July.\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the Control of Rent Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Cap. 242) has been amended on two previous\r\n\r\noccasions in order to suspend the two sections\r\n\r\nunder discussion.

This\r\n\r\npractice is followed in our local Merchant\r\n\r\nShipping Ordinance which prescribes the different\r\n\r\nmanning scales that are required for ships in each\r\n\r\nof these three categories: foreign-going, home-trade and local-trade.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time now, it has been recognised that\r\n\r\nthe manning scales prescribed for such ships in\r\n\r\nthe existing Ordinance are unnecessarily\r\n\r\ncomplicated and restrict the opportunities of\r\n\r\nlocally qualified mariners from command of these\r\n\r\nships. As an example of man-made complications,\r\n\r\nthe present law classifies those who can command\r\n\r\nships of 25, 75 and 100 tons. This is the policy\r\n\r\nof the past which we now seek to remedy. The\r\n\r\neffect of such a restrictive policy only serves to\r\n\r\ndiscourage our local citizens\r\n\r\nfrom making the sea a career. As a consequence of\r\n\r\nthis complication, we have at present a multitude\r\n\r\nof certificates of competency issued to local\r\n\r\nmariners.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various unions of local mariners have long\r\n\r\nprotested against the situation I have described.\r\n\r\nThey have constantly agitated for an extension of\r\n\r\nthe local trade limits. The P.A.P. Government re\r\n\r\ncognises the validity of their claims and has\r\n\r\ncarefully examined ways and means to meet them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shipping, however, is an international business.\r\n\r\nIt is futile for us to legislate shipping laws of\r\n\r\nour own if there is no concurrence from the\r\n\r\ngovernments of other countries to which our ships\r\n\r\ngo. For example, recently, a Singapore registered\r\n\r\nship, the motor vessel \"New Constitution\", was\r\n\r\ndetained in a neighbouring\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nterritory because it was not up to the manning\r\n\r\nstandards of that territory. Such cases will not\r\n\r\noccur when all territories have an agreed manning\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before drafting this Bill which is now presented\r\n\r\nto the House it was necessary, therefore, to seek\r\n\r\na common agreement between our Government and the\r\n\r\nGovernments of the Federation of Malaya, North\r\n\r\nBorneo, Sarawak and Brunei. At the request of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government, a meeting of the marine\r\n\r\nofficials of the\r\n\r\nfive Governments was recently convened. At this\r\n\r\nmeeting, agreement was reached on an extension of\r\n\r\nthe local-trade limits along the Sarawak and North\r\n\r\nBorneo coasts and a simplification of the manning\r\n\r\nscales for local-trade ships. The terms of this\r\n\r\nagreement are embodied in clauses 2 and 3 of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also agreed at this meeting that each\r\n\r\nterritory could, as a domestic matter, provide for\r\n\r\nmore simplified manning scales for small vessels\r\n\r\noperating on or near their coasts. The Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya and Singapore representatives agreed on\r\n\r\na simplified manning scale to operate within\r\n\r\nthirty miles of ports in the Federation and\r\n\r\nSingapore. This simplified scale is in sub-clause\r\n\r\n(3) of clause 3 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of all these changes is to widen the\r\n\r\nscope of employment potential for local officers\r\n\r\nand engine-drivers. The size of ships which they\r\n\r\nmay command is now increased. There is also an in\r\n\r\ncrease in the horsepower of ships' engines which\r\n\r\nlocal engine-drivers may take charge of. Finally,\r\n\r\nthe geographical limits within which locally\r\n\r\ncertificated mariners may command ships are being\r\n\r\nextended. These limits have been drawn up in the\r\n\r\nchart accompanying the Bill and Members of the\r\n\r\nHouse will notice that there is a considerable\r\n\r\nextension of these limits up to Tawau on the\r\n\r\nBorneo coast.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these changes have been referred to the\r\n\r\nunions of the officers concerned, to the\r\n\r\nassociations of ship owners and to marine\r\n\r\ninsurance companies who do not object to the new\r\n\r\nproposals embodied in this Bill. The proposals\r\n\r\nhave been received enthusiastically by the unions\r\n\r\nof local officers.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment to the Merchant Shipping Ordinance\r\n\r\nis a great achievement of international co-operation.

No doubt partly\r\n\r\nbecause of this, the Federation Government decided\r\n\r\nto withdraw their Bill at the Second Reading, and\r\n\r\nthis gave rise to hopes that we in Singapore might\r\n\r\ndo likewise. Actually the reason why the\r\n\r\nFederation Government withdrew the Bill was not\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthat they wavered in their resolve to implement\r\n\r\nthe policies underlying the Bill. It became\r\n\r\napparent to both Governments that much of the\r\n\r\nobjections raised against the provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill rested on misunderstandings and\r\n\r\nmisconceptions. Accordingly it was agreed between\r\n\r\nthe two Governments that a meeting of their\r\n\r\nFinance Ministers, with Government Backbenchers\r\n\r\nand their official advisers could profitably\r\n\r\ndiscuss public response to the Bill and how best\r\n\r\nthe provisions of the Bill could be explained and\r\n\r\npresented to the public. A meeting duly took place\r\n\r\nin Kuala Lumpur on the 0th of April and agreement\r\n\r\nwas reached on all points. This meeting proved\r\n\r\nmost useful in that it drew attention to many\r\n\r\npoints on which public disquiet had arisen, and\r\n\r\nthe reasons why this came about.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this meeting, a number of\r\n\r\namendments were agreed upon, all of which are of a\r\n\r\nminor nature, and I will move these amendments at\r\n\r\nthe Committee Stage. But first I wish to discuss\r\n\r\nsome basic considerations. Income tax legislation\r\n\r\nmust be as close as possible in the two\r\n\r\nterritories. And this is no more than a realistic\r\n\r\nadmission of the essential economic unity of the\r\n\r\ntwo countries. At all stages of the drafting of\r\n\r\nthe Bill, continuous discussions took place\r\n\r\nbetween the two Governments both at official and\r\n\r\nMinisterial levels. This Bill represents the\r\n\r\nfruition of the co-operative effort made by the\r\n\r\ntwo administrations in tackling a problem common\r\n\r\nto both. I may, perhaps, be allowed to place on\r\n\r\nrecord the keen and detailed personal interest and\r\n\r\ninitiative taken by my Federation opposite number,\r\n\r\nthe Hon. Mr Tan Siew Sin, in the drafting of the\r\n\r\nBill now before us.

Many\r\n\r\nprofessional and trade organisations have written\r\n\r\nto me\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nexpressing their opinion on various clauses of the\r\n\r\nBill. This is not the proper place to answer these\r\n\r\nbodies but there is a common thread running\r\n\r\nthrough much of what they have to say and it would\r\n\r\nnot, therefore, be out of place to refer generally\r\n\r\nto some of these. I shall, of course, be sending\r\n\r\ndetailed replies to these associations in due\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let, me now deal with the specific clauses of\r\n\r\nthe Bill. Clause 1 provides that the Bill shall\r\n\r\ncome into operation with effect from the 1st of\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1960, unless it is otherwise expressly\r\n\r\nstated. A harmless enough provision. But it has\r\n\r\ngiven rise to the charge that this constitutes\r\n\r\nretrospective legislation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, restrospective legislation is not\r\n\r\nunknown in the annals of Income Tax legislation - I\r\n\r\nhave been advised that there are, for instance,\r\n\r\nsection 20 of the U.K. Finance Act, 1922 and\r\n\r\nsection 242 of the U.K. Income Tax Ordinance, the\r\n\r\ndetails of which, need not detain us here. But\r\n\r\nclause 1 of the Bill cannot be cited as an example\r\n\r\nof retrospective legislation. Tax assessments\r\n\r\nrelate to a year of assessment and to allow\r\n\r\namendments to operate as from the date of the\r\n\r\npassage of the Bill would lead to anomalous\r\n\r\nassessments during the year. For instance, the\r\n\r\nBill introduces a new element, namely, the\r\n\r\ntaxation of incomes derived from certain types of\r\n\r\nsettlements. It would be wrong to tax such incomes\r\n\r\nduring the current year, when the assessments are\r\n\r\nraised after the passage of the Bill and exempt\r\n\r\nthose assessed before that date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 has not aroused much controversy. It\r\n\r\ngives the Minister authority to issue to the\r\n\r\nComptroller-General or the Comptroller directives\r\n\r\nof a general character not inconsistent with the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Ordinance. However, I note, in\r\n\r\nthe Notices of Amendments to Bills in Committee\r\n\r\nthat the clause does not meet with the approval of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Farrer Park. I do not intend to\r\n\r\nanticipate his objections, and will now move on to\r\n\r\nclause 3, which regulates the exchange of\r\n\r\ninformation between the Tax Administrations of the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya; and Singapore. Again the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park does not wholly\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\napprove the clause as it stands, but we shall\r\n\r\ndoubtless come to that in Committee stage.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 4, we come against what looks like a\r\n\r\nminor outcry. This clause provides that income\r\n\r\nfrom settlement shall be deemed to be the income\r\n\r\nof the settlor if the beneficiary is a relative of\r\n\r\nthe settlor and if he is unmarried and less than\r\n\r\n21 years of age at the commencement of the year of\r\n\r\nassessment. In simple language, this means that a\r\n\r\nman cannot reduce his tax liability by, for\r\n\r\ninstance, giving shares in his business to his\r\n\r\nyoung children. When you go through the Income Tax\r\n\r\nfiles of certain persons, you will be astounded at\r\n\r\nthe number of boys and girls who are nominal\r\n\r\npartners or shareholders of the businesses of\r\n\r\ntheir fathers. In some families, hardly is a baby\r\n\r\nborn before he becomes a registered partner or\r\n\r\nshareholder.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, all this is going to stop and about time\r\n\r\ntoo. But this does not prevent some people raising\r\n\r\nobjections to clause 4. Settlements made by\r\n\r\nparents in favour of their children it is claimed,\r\n\r\nis a singularly Eastern virtue, inspired both by\r\n\r\nmotives of prudence and love of the family. Why\r\n\r\nshould virtue be discriminated against? Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I am all in favour of the principle\r\n\r\nthat virtue should be rewarded. In a well ordered\r\n\r\nsociety virtue will doubtless bring about its own\r\n\r\nreward in, for instance, the form of greater\r\n\r\nhappiness. But in the imperfect world we live in,\r\n\r\nthis does not always happen and so some people\r\n\r\nlead a life of virtue in the hope of a reward in\r\n\r\nthe hereafter. But it is a novel proposition that\r\n\r\nthe reward for virtue should be given by a\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance here and now, more especially\r\n\r\nso when its exercise would lead to a diminution of\r\n\r\nthe State Revenues.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not possible to agree to the\r\n\r\nrequest that income from all forms of settlements\r\n\r\nto minor relatives be exempted from taxation. Nor\r\n\r\nis the Government willing to allow exemption in\r\n\r\nrespect of income from irrevocable settlements in\r\n\r\nfavour of minor relatives.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One criticism against clause 4 which I have come\r\n\r\nacross is its allegedly retrospective effect on\r\n\r\nsettlements previously entered into. I cannot see\r\n\r\nhow the, question of retrospective taxation comes\r\n\r\nin at all since these settlements will be taxed\r\n\r\nfor the first time in 1960. And it would surely be\r\n\r\ninequitable to tax future settlements and not\r\n\r\nexisting ones.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 strengthens the hands of the Comptroller\r\n\r\nagainst evaders of income tax. The need for these\r\n\r\npowers are so apparent that not much need be said\r\n\r\nother than to state that these powers are\r\n\r\nperfectly normal ones and are contained in the\r\n\r\ntaxing legislation of most countries of the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 requires all businesses to keep proper\r\n\r\nrecords of their transactions. Under the existing\r\n\r\nlegislation a person need not keep any records at\r\n\r\nall unless the Comptroller specifically directs\r\n\r\nhim to do so. And of course when matters have\r\n\r\nreached this stage, much damage has already been\r\n\r\ndone. The purpose of the clause is to make tax\r\n\r\nevasion more difficult to carry out and more easy\r\n\r\nto detect and punish. No one would object to that.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary, in the application of this\r\n\r\nsection of the Bill, to frame a proper strategy.\r\n\r\nIt is important that we do not waste time and\r\n\r\neffort straining after the small fry while\r\n\r\nallowing the big fish to escape. I have discussed\r\n\r\nthis matter with the Comptroller, especially the\r\n\r\napplication of clause 6 (1) (b). This requires all\r\n\r\nbusinesses with gross receipts exceeding $18,000 a\r\n\r\nyear from sales of goods or $12,000 a year from\r\n\r\nthe performance of services to issue serially\r\n\r\nnumbered receipts. The Comptroller under sub-clause (3) has the power to waive this requirement\r\n\r\nin respect of any person or class of persons. It\r\n\r\nhas been agreed that for the current year of as\r\n\r\nsessment, the following categories of persons will\r\n\r\nbe exempted from the requirement to issue serially\r\n\r\nnumbered receipts:-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) All hawkers unless individually directed by\r\n\r\nthe Comptroller to issue receipts.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Market and roadside stallholders (not shop-keepers) unless individually directed by\r\n\r\nthe Comptroller to issue receipts.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Retail traders carrying on businesses in\r\n\r\npremises for which the rent paid does not\r\n\r\nexceed $50 per month and not more than\r\n\r\nthree persons assist in carrying on the business.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) All traders whose gross receipts did not\r\n\r\nexceed $36,000 in the previous year.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Taxi drivers, trishaw-riders and self-employed boatmen plying for passengers in\r\n\r\nthe harbour.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are extensive exemptions. If any business\r\n\r\nnot covered by the above wishes to obtain\r\n\r\nexemption from the provisions of sub-clause (1)\r\n\r\n(b), it may apply to the Comptroller. It may be\r\n\r\nappropriate for me to say something about\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy in this matter. There are two\r\n\r\naspects of the question I want to discuss. First\r\n\r\nthere is the general problem of inadequate record\r\n\r\nkeeping and accounting systems of private\r\n\r\nbusinesses. The second deals with possible\r\n\r\ndifferences in the administration of this part of\r\n\r\nthe income tax law as between Singapore and the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as regards the first problem, it has been a\r\n\r\nlong standing complaint that the taxpayer who\r\n\r\ndischarges in full his tax liability are the\r\n\r\nsalaried employees and the public corporations\r\n\r\nwith modern accounting systems. Other persons, in\r\n\r\ncluding sole proprietorships and partnerships, are\r\n\r\nsuspected of extensive tax evasion because of the\r\n\r\ninadequate system of record keeping. If you are\r\n\r\npaid a salary of $1,000 per month, you can hardly\r\n\r\nhope to pretend to the Comptroller that you did\r\n\r\nnot earn such an amount. But there is no assurance\r\n\r\nthat receipts from miscellaneous small and medium\r\n\r\nbusinesses are properly accounted for.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure proper accounting in this sector of the\r\n\r\neconomy would mean not merely the passage of the\r\n\r\nnecessary law.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nThere are two further requirements. First the\r\n\r\nmachinery of enforcement must be built and geared\r\n\r\ninto action. Next there must be widespread\r\n\r\nconsciousness among the public who buy things that\r\n\r\nthe retailer must be made to observe the law. When\r\n\r\nthe public is aware that tax evasion is a\r\n\r\nreprehensible crime whose victim is the public\r\n\r\nitself, then we shall be able more adequately to\r\n\r\nenforce the law. It will take time and effort to\r\n\r\nbuild up public opinion along these lines. This we\r\n\r\nmust and shall do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the possible different application of\r\n\r\nthis clause as between the Federation and\r\n\r\nSingapore, it must be remembered that the scale of\r\n\r\npersonal reliefs in Singapore for the time being\r\n\r\nis higher than that in the Federation. So long as\r\n\r\nthis is so, the Comptroller in Singapore can be\r\n\r\nfreer in the exercise of his powers of exemption\r\n\r\nunder sub-clause (3). But the position must be\r\n\r\nkept under continuous review, and in principle it\r\n\r\nis desirable that in the Bill itself the limits\r\n\r\nfor automatic exemption from the issue of receipts\r\n\r\nshould be kept identical in both territories.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may now move on to clause 7. This requires an\r\n\r\nemployer to retain for a period of 30 days any\r\n\r\nmoneys owing to an employee who has ceased employ\r\n\r\nment with him, unless the Comptroller releases him\r\n\r\nfrom this obligation before then. The penalty for\r\n\r\ninfringement is laid down in clause 15. Some\r\n\r\nemployers have expressed the fear that under\r\n\r\nclause 15, they may be saddled with the tax\r\n\r\nliability of an employee who disappears as soon as\r\n\r\nhe has received his pay packet. This apprehension\r\n\r\nis groundless. For if the employer does not hold\r\n\r\nany money payable to an employee, as would be the\r\n\r\ncase in the instance quoted, he is free from any\r\n\r\nobligation under clause 7.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some explanation is due for the extension,\r\n\r\nprovided by clause 8, of the period, during which\r\n\r\nadditional assessments may be raised, from six\r\n\r\nyears to twelve years. It has been found impos\r\n\r\nsible to dispose of all cases of suspected evasion\r\n\r\ngiven the present number of experienced staff. The\r\n\r\nposition is improving but there is a backlog of\r\n\r\ncases\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\narising from the post-Korean War boom years of\r\n\r\n1950-52. It is not easy to obtain convictions for\r\n\r\nfraud but the proposed amendment will ensure that\r\n\r\nomissions of income, when discovered, can be\r\n\r\nincluded in the assessments for the relevant years\r\n\r\nand that the tax not lost forever.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 10 introduce a radical change in\r\n\r\nregard to the payment of tax which is the subject\r\n\r\nof appeal or objection. Section 85 of the\r\n\r\nPrincipal Ordinance, which is repealed by clause\r\n\r\n9, allows the deferment of payment of disputed tax\r\n\r\nuntil the objection or appeal is determined.\r\n\r\nClause 10 lays down that the tax must be paid\r\n\r\nfirst though the Comptroller may at his discretion\r\n\r\nallow an extension of time. These new proposals\r\n\r\nhave caused agitation in certain quarters. Fears\r\n\r\nhave been expressed that these clauses now give\r\n\r\nthe Comptroller untrammelled power to ruin a\r\n\r\nperson, if he is so disposed. The critics would\r\n\r\nhardly be satisfied with the argument that there\r\n\r\nis no reason to suppose that the Comptroller would\r\n\r\nbe so disposed and would not exercise his powers\r\n\r\nother than in accordance with accepted principles\r\n\r\nof tax assessment. The lurking fear remains.\r\n\r\nSupposing the man, acting in all honesty, makes a\r\n\r\nmistake?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to defend these clauses on three\r\n\r\ngrounds. First, let us consider how the large\r\n\r\nmajority of disputed assessments arise. Let us\r\n\r\nstick to real facts and practices and not move\r\n\r\ninto the world of hypothesis and fancy. The great\r\n\r\nmajority of disputes over assessments are those\r\n\r\nraised in consequence of information obtained on\r\n\r\ninvestigation. These reveal an accretion of assets\r\n\r\nwhose sources the taxpayer cannot explain satis.\r\n\r\nfactorily. This, in itself, does not justify a\r\n\r\nprosecution for fraud. But the possession of these\r\n\r\nassets is not in dispute and it is in such\r\n\r\ninstances that assessments are raised and almost\r\n\r\ninvariably disputed. The tax therefore is only a\r\n\r\npart of these assets and it is not possible for\r\n\r\nthe assessee to be made bankrupt solely by virtue\r\n\r\nof his tax liability unless he has in the meantime\r\n\r\nsquandered his assets by extravagant and possibly\r\n\r\nprofligate dealings.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why the present system of\r\n\r\ndeferred payments must cease is that it is only\r\n\r\ntoo apparent that too many taxpayers are taking\r\n\r\nadvantage of the existing legislation to postpone\r\n\r\nthe day of payment. On the 31st December, 1959,\r\n\r\nthe amount of tax outstanding on objections was no\r\n\r\nless than $30 millions. If we apply the current\r\n\r\nrate of interest, this would mean a loss to the\r\n\r\nrevenue on interest alone of nearly $2 millions a\r\n\r\nyear. It is therefore obvious that the present\r\n\r\nposition is utterly scandalous and cannot be\r\n\r\nallowed to continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally for those who consider that the new\r\n\r\nproposals give abnormal powers to the Comptroller,\r\n\r\nlet me say that similar provisions appear in the\r\n\r\ntax statutes of India, New Zealand, Australia, Cey\r\n\r\nlon, Canada and Hong Kong. Hong Kong has never\r\n\r\nacquired the reputation of harshness towards\r\n\r\nbusinessmen and when their Income Tax Ordinance\r\n\r\ncloses this particular loophole, we are well\r\n\r\nadvised to do likewise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining clauses of the Bill are not\r\n\r\ncontroversial, except perhaps for clause 14. The\r\n\r\nobjects of all these clauses are described in the\r\n\r\nexplanatory statement to the Bill and I need not\r\n\r\ntherefore dwell upon them except for clause 14,\r\n\r\nover which a great deal of the apprehension caused\r\n\r\nappears to be misplaced. Objection is taken to the\r\n\r\nprovision that in certain classes of civil or\r\n\r\ncriminal proceedings, a statement of the\r\n\r\nComptroller shall be accepted as a prima facie evi\r\n\r\ndence so far as it relates to, a statement of\r\n\r\nfact. From this position, a great leap forward is\r\n\r\ntaken by some of the melodramatic critics to the\r\n\r\nconclusion that a man is presumed guilty unless he\r\n\r\nproves himself innocent. Consequently clause 14\r\n\r\nstands condemned as a fundamental breach of\r\n\r\nnatural justice.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no one can say that I am a hard-\r\n\r\nhearted person or that I am insensitive to the\r\n\r\nprinciples of natural justice. But I confess I am\r\n\r\nquite unmoved by these pleas. I suggest that\r\n\r\nbefore these persons take off into the realms of\r\n\r\nfantasy, they may do well to ask themselves in\r\n\r\nwhat kind of proceedings this clause would apply.\r\n\r\nThe answer is given in sub-clause (3) (b) which\r\n\r\nexplicitly excludes\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproceedings for an offence punishable by\r\n\r\nimprisonment. And this brings us to section 94 of\r\n\r\nthe Principal Ordinance which defines such\r\n\r\noffences. These consist principally of the\r\n\r\nfailures to make returns in time and failure to\r\n\r\npay tax within the prescribed period. These are\r\n\r\nrelatively trivial offences though the number of\r\n\r\noffenders is large. It is therefore necessary to\r\n\r\nmake provision for the expeditious disposal of\r\n\r\nsuch cases. I am advised by my colleague, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law, that the practice of\r\n\r\ncreating a presumption does not run counter to ac\r\n\r\ncepted legal principles, and there are many\r\n\r\ninstances in legislation both in our country and\r\n\r\nelsewhere of this.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to conclude my speech\r\n\r\nwith a few general remarks on the course in which\r\n\r\nI hope this debate will take. The Government is\r\n\r\nfully aware that the Bill provides for an\r\n\r\nextension of powers granted to the tax\r\n\r\nauthorities. We are also aware that any extension\r\n\r\nof power granted to the executives carries with it\r\n\r\na certain degree of risk. This is inevitably so in\r\n\r\nthe nature of things.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are we to assess the degree of risk as\r\n\r\nagainst the possible advantages in the way of\r\n\r\nimproved efficiency that will be brought about?\r\n\r\nThere are two possible approaches. The first is to\r\n\r\ntake a purely academic and theoretical approach\r\n\r\nand to raise one's hands in horror at every\r\n\r\nconceivable and even inconceivable possibility of\r\n\r\nabuse of power. I suggest that this approach is\r\n\r\nfruitless and sterile.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must judge this issue on the facts as they are\r\n\r\nas regards the efficiency and competence of our\r\n\r\ntax administration. In Singapore we have a small\r\n\r\nand comparatively young income tax department.\r\n\r\nThis department, like all other Government\r\n\r\ndepartments, has gone through the stresses of\r\n\r\nmalayanisation. But I think it will be a fair\r\n\r\nappraisal of the work they are doing to say that\r\n\r\nthey are a technically competent and responsible\r\n\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is working out a scheme whereby\r\n\r\nofficers of the Income Tax Department can have\r\n\r\nimproved terms of conditions of service in order\r\n\r\nthat efficient officers can achieve promotion to\r\n\r\nthe topmost post. This will help further to raise\r\n\r\nthe level of professional\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncompetence of officers of the department. Already\r\n\r\nthere are signs of improved efficiency in tax\r\n\r\nassessments and collections. For instance, in the\r\n\r\nfirst four months of the year, the amount of tax\r\n\r\ncollected has been considerably greater than that\r\n\r\nfor the corresponding period of last year.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking all matters into consideration, I have no\r\n\r\nhesitation in coming to the conclusion that the\r\n\r\npowers which will be granted to the tax\r\n\r\nadministration by this Bill will be used with\r\n\r\nfairness and responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition, of course, is free to say what\r\n\r\nthey like but their remarks will bear greater\r\n\r\nweight if they would refrain from taking the\r\n\r\npurely theoretical approach and instead tackle the\r\n\r\nproblem as a practical problem of tax administra\r\n\r\ntion. If they take this attitude when discussing\r\n\r\nspecific provisions of the Bill, then I have no\r\n\r\ndoubt that the tax administration, in the\r\n\r\nexecution of their work, will bear their views in\r\n\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there can be very\r\n\r\nlittle doubt that there is a great deal of tax\r\n\r\nevasion in Singapore. We on the Opposition side\r\n\r\nwill support the Government in every reasonable\r\n\r\nmeasure it takes to bring to book and to heel all\r\n\r\nthose people who are now evading taxation, because\r\n\r\nfor every person who evades taxation, a correspond\r\n\r\ningly heavier burden is put on the honest citizen\r\n\r\nwho pays his tax regularly, punctually and to the\r\n\r\nfull amount that he is due to pay under the law.\r\n\r\nTherefore, all these evaders put a very heavy\r\n\r\nburden on the honest citizen, and any attempt by\r\n\r\nthe Government to bring these people to book will\r\n\r\nmeet with the support of the Opposition. But in\r\n\r\nframing proposals to bring these evaders to book,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, one has always do keep a proper\r\n\r\nbalance between the powers given to officials and\r\n\r\nundue infringement on the personal liberties of a\r\n\r\nprivate citizen. Our system of society is based on\r\n\r\nthat conception of the law and it has worked very\r\n\r\nwell up to now, except, it seems, in so far as\r\n\r\nincome\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntax goes. Therefore, the Minister has brought in a\r\n\r\nnumber of amendments which he hopes will bring to\r\n\r\nbook all these evaders.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have on a number of occasions said in this\r\n\r\nHouse that the making of a law does not mean that\r\n\r\nthe offender will be brought to book. The most im\r\n\r\nportant thing is to have an organisation which is\r\n\r\ncapable of spotting the offender, and having\r\n\r\nspotted him, to bring him to book. I make so bold\r\n\r\nas to say, Mr Speaker, that if all the existing\r\n\r\nprovisions of the existing Ordinance have been\r\n\r\nfully availed of by the tax officers, there would\r\n\r\nnot have been this deficit, or this non-payment,\r\n\r\nof $30 million to the extent that there is now,\r\n\r\nand many more taxpayers would have been on the\r\n\r\nroll of taxpayers.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister, I think, in his speech on\r\n\r\nthe Second Reading of the Bill, did concede the\r\n\r\npoint that whatever laws you may have it is the\r\n\r\nmachinery of enforcement that is the import\r\n\r\nant thing. Mr Speaker, Sir, even if the powers\r\n\r\ngiven to the officers are twice that which the\r\n\r\nMinister seeks to obtain from this House, but the\r\n\r\nmachinery of enforcement is not there, then not\r\n\r\nall the powers given to him by this House will\r\n\r\nenable his bringing on to the tax roll greater\r\n\r\nnumbers of people who should now be on it, thereby\r\n\r\nresulting in a greater collection of taxes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the taxing office - the Comptroller\r\n\r\nand his staff - have been given a weapon under the\r\n\r\ntaxing Ordinances. I do not say this in any sense\r\n\r\nof disparagement, Mr Speaker, Sir, but if they\r\n\r\nknew how to handle that weapon efficiently, then I\r\n\r\nthink much more could have been done. The gun has\r\n\r\nbeen placed in the hands of the taxing departments\r\n\r\nto bring to book the offending taxpayer and the\r\n\r\nevader. But it appears that the taxing officials\r\n\r\nhave not yet learnt to use that gun properly. And\r\n\r\nbecause they are unable to use it properly and to\r\n\r\nshoot the tax evader with the first or second or\r\n\r\neven third shot, they are now asking the Assembly,\r\n\r\n\"Give us a hand grenade.

We all know that for\r\n\r\na long time the Income Tax Department has been\r\n\r\nconsidered fair game for all and sundry who wish\r\n\r\nto measure wits with the Government officials.\r\n\r\nIncome tax evasion has been the result. Some\r\n\r\npeople have developed this game of tax evasion\r\n\r\ninto a fine art, more often than not with the help\r\n\r\nof legal and specially trained personnel in\r\n\r\naccounts, and those who know the workings inside\r\n\r\nthe Income Tax Department. That tax evasion is\r\n\r\nrampant has been admitted by everybody. Many have\r\n\r\nindulged in tax evasion unashamedly. They do not\r\n\r\nconsider it a heinous crime to get the better of\r\n\r\nthe Income Tax Department. They have no\r\n\r\ninhibitions about it with friends and in their in\r\n\r\ntimate circles. It is not uncommon, Sir, for\r\n\r\ncertain tax evaders to get together and discuss\r\n\r\namongst themselves ways and means whereby they can\r\n\r\nmatch their wits against the probing powers of the\r\n\r\nComptroller of Income Tax.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has just mentioned\r\n\r\nsomething about the evader. But what about those\r\n\r\nwho are more circumspect and who go about the\r\n\r\nbusiness in the so-called legal way? For example,\r\n\r\nas the Minister has just mentioned, we find the\r\n\r\nvery rich very magnanimously and generously making\r\n\r\nprovisions for the comparatively young and\r\n\r\nunmarried children and relatives in their so-\r\n\r\ncalled settlements. While not questioning their\r\n\r\nright to provide for dependants, it is quite\r\n\r\nobvious also that\r\n\r\nsuch settlements are cunning devices of the rich\r\n\r\nto cock a snook at the Income Tax Comptroller. And\r\n\r\nthere is nothing the Income Tax Comptroller can do\r\n\r\nabout it. Then again there are those who, though\r\n\r\ncaught and accordingly assessed, still manage to\r\n\r\nemploy delaying tactics in rather frivolous and\r\n\r\nsystematic appeals to the Board of Review. The\r\n\r\nhuge sum which the Minister says has been held up\r\n\r\nas a result of all these appeals is simply\r\n\r\nshocking. One can imagine how the building of\r\n\r\nschools and hospitals has been held up because of\r\n\r\nthese prolonged tactical appeals. It is not fair\r\n\r\nfor a small number of people to hold up\r\n\r\ndevelopments which are of benefit to the large\r\n\r\nmajority of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember, Sir, that we are now a self\r\n\r\ngoverning State. All of us must now bear our fair\r\n\r\nshare in the responsibility of building our\r\n\r\neconomy. It is only right that the responsibility\r\n\r\nshould fall more on the shoulders of those best\r\n\r\nable to bear it and, as mentioned by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Farrer Park, tax evaders throw an extra burden\r\n\r\non the shoulders of the rest of the population.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. Government has always the interest of\r\n\r\nthe masses at heart. This Bill, Sir, as has\r\n\r\nrightly been called in the newspapers and\r\n\r\nelsewhere, is a war on tax evaders - those, you may\r\n\r\nsay, anti-social elements who deprive the masses\r\n\r\nof enjoying the maximum benefits that State\r\n\r\nrevenue can bring to the people. This Bill will\r\n\r\nendeavour to close the net and loopholes against\r\n\r\ntax evaders. Where loopholes still exist, it will\r\n\r\nbecome increasingly difficult and hazardous for\r\n\r\ntax evaders in view of the increased penalties.\r\n\r\nThis Bill is not\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmeant to harass the taxpayers as has been\r\n\r\nsuggested by some quarters. In fact, far from\r\n\r\nharassing the taxpayers, this Bill will protect\r\n\r\nthe honest taxpayers. It allows the Comptroller an\r\n\r\nopportunity to separate the black sheep that have\r\n\r\nso far besmirched the good name of honest\r\n\r\ntaxpayers.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill deserves the support of all who have\r\n\r\nthe welfare of the people of Singapore at heart.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\non the Opposition side are in favour of any fair\r\n\r\nand just measure to prevent tax evasion, but we\r\n\r\nfeel that in the case of an important and\r\n\r\ncontroversial amending Bill like this one, it\r\n\r\nwould be better if it were to be referred to a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee to enable interested bodies and\r\n\r\nindividuals to make proper representations and to\r\n\r\nappear before the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Sir, that it is now too late for a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee to be appointed, but if one were to be\r\n\r\nappointed, it would remove from the minds of the\r\n\r\nmany would be representors that they are treated\r\n\r\nunfairly.

Everybody knows\r\n\r\nthat professional accountants, income tax\r\n\r\nconsultants and legal advisors all start off on\r\n\r\nthe major premise that it is fair game to beat the\r\n\r\nincome tax man. We have inherited the British\r\n\r\ntradition that if you are able, either by your wit\r\n\r\nor your ingenuity, to go round the fiscal laws,\r\n\r\nthen good luck to you. I am glad to see that the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park is consciously suppressing\r\n\r\nhis more natural attitude to tax evasion and to\r\n\r\nthose who help tax evaders in a legally, orderly\r\n\r\nand effective manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one argument which would move us.\r\n\r\nIf the Opposition can show that any of these laws\r\n\r\nwould result in a man being taxed for what he has\r\n\r\nnot got, then we, as the Government, would be the\r\n\r\nfirst to make sure that not only is he not taxed,\r\n\r\nbut that if in the unfortunate event he has been\r\n\r\nmade to pay for something he has never earned,\r\n\r\nthen it will be refunded to him. But all this\r\n\r\nraising of hands for the poor, good, honest\r\n\r\ntaxpayer as distinct from the tax evader is a lot\r\n\r\nof hypocrisy if, having subscribed to the major\r\n\r\npremise that tax evasion should be stopped, we\r\n\r\nthen come round, by devious arguments, to the pro\r\n\r\nposition of allowing it within certain limited\r\n\r\nranges.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly support what the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nhas said, that if other countries like Hongkong,\r\n\r\nmore renowned for their kindness and softness of\r\n\r\nheart to industrialists and merchants, have found\r\n\r\nit necessary to deal with them not so much with\r\n\r\nhandgrenades as with dumdum bullets, then I say by\r\n\r\nall means let us give our Income Tax Department\r\n\r\nthe dum-dum bullets. Sir, in other parts of the\r\n\r\nworld, there is the idea of maintaining two or\r\n\r\nthree sets of accounts - one is for the income tax\r\n\r\nman, the second is for your partner, and the third\r\n\r\nis for yourself and your family. Where you do not\r\n\r\nhave such practices, it might well be that you do\r\n\r\nnot require bullets that will pierce through\r\n\r\nbullet-proof vests.

The Member for Tanglin has\r\n\r\nsaid that this Bill should be referred to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. What is there in this Bill for a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee to consider when everybody is agreed\r\n\r\nthat tax evasion should be eradicated? There is\r\n\r\nnothing controversial about the question of\r\n\r\nsettlement. Mr Speaker, Sir, there have been\r\n\r\nreferences to the natural instinct to provide for\r\n\r\none's family, and suggestions that the proposal to\r\n\r\nignore settlements would appear to deny a person's\r\n\r\nright to spread out the incidence of tax by the\r\n\r\ndisposition of his own property. The natural\r\n\r\ninstinct of a person to provide for his family\r\n\r\ndoes not primarily involve the creation of a\r\n\r\nsettlement. In the case of the poorer classes, the\r\n\r\nlack of assets normally precludes the creation of\r\n\r\nsettlements and, therefore, parents provide for\r\n\r\ntheir families in the form of food, clothing and\r\n\r\naccommodation. It is usually only where the crea\r\n\r\ntion of settlements results in considerable\r\n\r\nsavings of tax that action is taken by taxpayers\r\n\r\nto provide for their children and others. It\r\n\r\ncannot be conceded that to prevent the rich from\r\n\r\nrelieving themselves of tax evasion by these means\r\n\r\nis a harsh measure. It must be emphasised that the\r\n\r\ntax in this case is not retrospective. To permit\r\n\r\nthese persons, prior to the passing of this\r\n\r\nlegisla\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntion, to be relieved of their obligation and only\r\n\r\ntax those who were not smart in the past would not\r\n\r\nbe just and equitable. You can find similar\r\n\r\nlegislation in other parts of the world - India, the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and\r\n\r\nPalestine.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes the payment of tax despite objections\r\n\r\nand appeals. First of all, Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to point out to Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition that countries like India, Hong Kong,\r\n\r\nNew Zealand, Australia, Ceylon and Canada have\r\n\r\nsimilar legislation. S.P.A. members and local\r\n\r\ncapitalists have often pointed out to us that Hong\r\n\r\nKong is an example for setting up conditions\r\n\r\nfavourable for investment. Hong Kong has this\r\n\r\nlegislation and this provision for the payment of\r\n\r\ntax despite objections and appeals. Why should we\r\n\r\nnot have it too? In India, they have had it for\r\n\r\nthe last two decades, or even for a longer period\r\n\r\nthan that. Ceylon has the same legislation. Nobody\r\n\r\nwill deny that a large number of taxpayers delay\r\n\r\npayments merely by lodging appeals. It can be\r\n\r\nargued the Comptroller has power to apply to the\r\n\r\nIncome Tax Board for an order for payment of\r\n\r\nsecurity towards the tax assessed, and if the\r\n\r\nBoard of Appeal finds that the appeal is vexatious\r\n\r\nor frivolous, it can order the appellant to pay\r\n\r\n$250 only. What is this $250 compared to the\r\n\r\nthousands of dollars which are due to the Income\r\n\r\nTax Department? I was once told - I do believe it - \r\n\r\nthat the interest earned by an appellant during\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\nperiod it took to hear the appeal was enough to\r\n\r\ncover his lawyer's expenses and other incidentals,\r\n\r\nand he had a surplus. Therefore, payment of tax\r\n\r\nbefore the appeal, i.e. despite the appeal, should\r\n\r\nbe enforced. I would like to point out, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that we are not making a precedent,\r\n\r\nand it is time now that we follow other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the suggestion that the taxpayer may be\r\n\r\nmade bankrupt by the Income Tax Department\r\n\r\nenforcing this provision. It is most unlikely,\r\n\r\nSir, that any Court will adjudicate a taxpayer\r\n\r\nbankrupt where it is not financially possible for\r\n\r\nhim to pay his tax. The\r\n\r\ntax\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nauthorities will think twice or thrice before they\r\n\r\nbegin to waste money to recover an irrecoverable\r\n\r\ndebt. The fact that the taxpayer possesses a lot\r\n\r\nof wealth should have been the reason why action\r\n\r\nis taken and the taxpayer then disposes of all his\r\n\r\nwealth and says that it is a hardship on him to\r\n\r\npay the tax. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nsay that these powers are quite necessary for the\r\n\r\nTax Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Baharaddin Bin Moh Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharaddin Bin Mohd. Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers on the other side understand the reasons\r\n\r\nwhy we are determined to bring in these tax\r\n\r\nevaders. It should be noted that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment will not impose a heavy burden on the\r\n\r\npeople. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, to save people from\r\n\r\nhaving to shoulder more responsibilities, we are\r\n\r\ntrying to get hold of those tax evaders. One of\r\n\r\nthe best methods to achieve this is by amending\r\n\r\nmany of the provisions of the old Income Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance. We find that this is the consensus of\r\n\r\nopinion not only in Singapore but also in the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, a meeting was held between the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the Governments of Singapore\r\n\r\nand the Federation of Malaya, and as has been\r\n\r\nstated by the Minister for Finance, both the\r\n\r\nMinisters for Finance of Singapore and the Fede\r\n\r\nration were present at this meeting. Those who are\r\n\r\nresponsible people and who go thoroughly and\r\n\r\ncarefully through the\r\n\r\namendments, will say that the amendments proposed\r\n\r\nare good indeed. But to those who are\r\n\r\nirresponsible, Mr Speaker, Sir, people who object\r\n\r\nfor the sake of objecting, as has been expressed\r\n\r\nby the Member for Farrer Park, naturally the\r\n\r\namendments will not be good. Mr Speaker, this\r\n\r\nmatter should be considered in this light, that we\r\n\r\nshould not impose a further taxation burden on\r\n\r\nthose people who are already paying their tax\r\n\r\nproperly. But it is appropriate to catch those who\r\n\r\nare tax evaders. At the meeting referred to, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, there were many clauses in this amending\r\n\r\nBill which did not meet the approval of members of\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government. But in view of the fact\r\n\r\nthat many development pro-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ngrammes have been announced by the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment and that we in Singapore have also\r\n\r\nsimilar projects, both Governments agreed to work\r\n\r\nin close collaboration with each other and approve\r\n\r\nthese amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the amendments concerns investigation into\r\n\r\nthe books. In the Federation, this clause has been\r\n\r\ndeleted, but we have reached agreement with the\r\n\r\nFederation Government on many other amendments. I\r\n\r\nthink the Opposition side should be careful when\r\n\r\nthey criticise and oppose the clauses which will\r\n\r\nbe discussed at the Committee stage later on.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I spent\r\n\r\nquite a lot of time yesterday preparing for this\r\n\r\ndebate, but after having heard what the Opposition\r\n\r\nhas had to say, I am wondering whether or not I\r\n\r\nhave not wasted all this time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Opposition Members say that they are\r\n\r\ncompletely in agreement with the Government that\r\n\r\ntax evasion is a very bad thing. But when we\r\n\r\npropose that something should be done about it,\r\n\r\nthey say, \"Better not! The present position\r\n\r\nregarding powers is good enough. Before we do\r\n\r\nanything rash, let us refer this matter to a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.\" Mr Speaker, Sir, that is not\r\n\r\nthe way the P.A.P. Government look at things. If\r\n\r\nwe think that the position is bad and needs\r\n\r\nremedying, we get down to the job of remedying it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In winding up the debate, I am not required to\r\n\r\nsay a great deal, simply because there is not much\r\n\r\nfor me to refute other than one point, perhaps two\r\n\r\npoints, raised by the Member for Farrer Park. He\r\n\r\nsaid that if only the present powers available to\r\n\r\nthe Comptroller were used, the tax of $30 million\r\n\r\nwhich I mentioned in my speech could easily be\r\n\r\ncollected. I am astonished that, as a lawyer, the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park could come to this\r\n\r\nconclusion. Section 85 of the principal Ordinance\r\n\r\nlays down quite definitely that the taxpayer need\r\n\r\nnot pay any tax under dispute until the dispute is\r\n\r\nsettled either before a Board of Review or a Court\r\n\r\nof Appeal. So this huge amount of tax is just\r\n\r\nbeing held back from Government by persons who use section 85.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nto deny to Government, for some time at least, the\r\n\r\npayment of tax due to the Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has also said that he\r\n\r\nconsiders that if administration were to be\r\n\r\nimproved, the existing powers are quite adequate.\r\n\r\nI have already cited one case where the existing\r\n\r\npowers are quite inadequate. But he on his side\r\n\r\nhas not given any details to support his\r\n\r\nproposition.

I refer now to section 7 of\r\n\r\nthe Income Tax Ordinance. Section 7 reads as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Malayan Board of Income Tax may from time to\r\n\r\ntime make rules-\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>with regard to a number of matters - \r\n\r\n(a), (b), (c) and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(d) generally to give effect to the provisions,\r\n\r\nother than the provisions of section 49 and\r\n\r\nof Part XII of  this Ordinance.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Section 49 of the Ordinance is a section dealing\r\n\r\nwith double taxation provisions, and Part XII of\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance deals with the procedure on appeals\r\n\r\nfrom the assessments of the Comptroller. So that\r\n\r\nsection 7 (1) (d) seems, to my mind, the same as\r\n\r\nthe purported new section 3A:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Minister may from time to time give the\r\n\r\nComptroller-General or Comptroller directions of a\r\n\r\ngeneral character, and not inconsistent with the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Ordinance, as to the exercise\r\n\r\nof the powers and discretions conferred on the\r\n\r\nComptroller-General...\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>As the Minister himself has said, it is of vital\r\n\r\nimportance in the administration of the income tax\r\n\r\nlaws of Singapore that we should be on all fours,\r\n\r\nor nearly on all fours, with the Federation\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nas far as possible. Now it was with that intent\r\n\r\nand purpose that the Malayan Board of Income Tax\r\n\r\nwas brought into existence under the provisions of\r\n\r\nthe Income Tax Ordinance. The composition of the\r\n\r\nMalayan Board of Income Tax is such that it has\r\n\r\nrepresentation both from the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nand from the State of Singapore. And the intention\r\n\r\nwas that it would be the Board which would make\r\n\r\nvarious decisions on the day-to-day administration\r\n\r\nthat would arise from implementing the Income Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance. Because of the necessity that the\r\n\r\nimplementation and administration should be\r\n\r\nsimilar in both the territories, it therefore\r\n\r\nbecame necessary for one body to give directions\r\n\r\nto both the Comptrollers as to how they were to\r\n\r\nadminister the Ordinance. I take it, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, that that was the intention and purpose of\r\n\r\ncreating a Malayan Board of Income Tax on which\r\n\r\nthere were representations both from Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya. If this section 3A\r\n\r\npasses into\r\n\r\nlaw, there will, in effect, be three persons who\r\n\r\nwill give directions to the Comptroller as to how\r\n\r\nthe provisions of this Ordinance are to be\r\n\r\nadministered. Whether the Minister can over-ride\r\n\r\nthe rules of the Malayan Board of Income Tax or\r\n\r\nvice versa, it is not for me at this juncture to\r\n\r\nstate. It would tend to create not only confusion,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, but it would also tend to create\r\n\r\na state of affairs where the Minister in Singapore\r\n\r\nmight give directions to the Comptroller here that\r\n\r\na certain provision of the Ordinance should be\r\n\r\nadministered in a certain way, and the Minister in\r\n\r\nthe Federation, in respect of the same section,\r\n\r\nmight give different administrative directions to\r\n\r\nhis Comptroller which would result in different\r\n\r\nadministrations of one particular section. If sec\r\n\r\ntion 3A passes into law, the Minister here would\r\n\r\nhave power to give directions of a general\r\n\r\ncharacter and not directions which he could give\r\n\r\nto the Comptroller with regard to a particular\r\n\r\nassessment. Therefore, why it is necessary to pass\r\n\r\nthis particular section 3A, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nat a loss to understand. I think section 7 of the\r\n\r\nexist\r\n\r\ning Ordinance provides for it, and there\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nis no need to bring in the new section 3A. If it\r\n\r\nis brought in, not only will it create confusion\r\n\r\nin Singapore but I think it will also lead to\r\n\r\ndisparity in administration of the two Ordinances\r\n\r\nboth here and in the Federation. It is vitally\r\n\r\nimportant that not only should the income tax laws\r\n\r\nin the Federation and here be the same, but that\r\n\r\nthe implementation and administration of the laws\r\n\r\nshould also proceed on similar lines. I think\r\n\r\nsection 7 of the Ordinance should prevail rather\r\n\r\nthan the intended new section 3A.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member\r\n\r\nfor Farrer Park has not paid sufficient attention\r\n\r\nto the actual wording of this new section. I will\r\n\r\nfind that it is specifically stated there that\r\n\r\nthough the Minister may give the Comptroller-General directions of a general character, the\r\n\r\ndirections which he gives must not be inconsistent\r\n\r\nwith the provisons of this Ordinance. If he gives\r\n\r\nany specific instruction to the Comptroller-General which is inconsistent with the procedures\r\n\r\nwhich have been laid down with the approval of the\r\n\r\nMalayan Board of Income Tax, then he would be\r\n\r\ncontravening the provisions of this Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThat is not the intention. Now, all Ministers have\r\n\r\ndepartmental duties to discharge. As political\r\n\r\nheads, it will be necessary for them to see that\r\n\r\nthe law is administered, and they can give, say,\r\n\r\ngeneral directions to their departmental heads as\r\n\r\nto the way in which they want the work of the\r\n\r\ndepartment to be carried out. That, I suggest, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is not in any way in conflict with\r\n\r\nthe rules which are laid down by the Malayan Board\r\n\r\nof Income Tax. That is all that the new section\r\n\r\nseeks to do.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate what\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Labour and Law has said, that the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance can only give directions of a\r\n\r\ngeneral character not inconsistent with the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Ordinance. But the purported\r\n\r\nnew section, Mr Speaker, Sir, does not say \"not\r\n\r\ninconsistent with the provisions of this Ordinance\r\n\r\nor any rules made there under\". It does not say\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthat, to begin with. In any case, section 7 (1)\r\n\r\n(d) of the Ordinance gives exactly the same powers\r\n\r\nto the Malayan Board of Income Tax. They can give\r\n\r\neffect to the provisions, other than the\r\n\r\nprovisions of section 49 and of Part XII, of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance by framing rules and laying them before\r\n\r\nthe Assembly, and on the Assembly passing them,\r\n\r\nthey will have the effect of law. Whereas here,\r\n\r\nthe Minister, merely by an administrative note to\r\n\r\nthe Comptroller, could ask him to do a lot of\r\n\r\nthings under the Ordinance not inconsistent with\r\n\r\nthe provisions of this Ordinance. My question to\r\n\r\nthe Minister is this. If the new section 3A is\r\n\r\nintended to increase the efficiency of the Income\r\n\r\nTax Department, and also to see that tax evasion\r\n\r\nis brought to heel, then all these powers are\r\n\r\nadequately contained in section 7 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance. Now if it took the matter any further\r\n\r\nand gave the Comptroller added powers to do it,\r\n\r\nthen I would agree. But it does not do any more\r\n\r\nthan what is already contained in section 7 (1)\r\n\r\n(d).\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed, Mr Speaker, Sir, that for the\r\n\r\nlast two or three years the Malayan Board of\r\n\r\nIncome Tax has been by-passed on every possible\r\n\r\noccasion. Matters which could have been referred\r\n\r\nto it have not been referred to it by Ministers\r\n\r\nboth here and in the Federation. By getting\r\n\r\ntogether over the table, they have decided how the\r\n\r\nlaw should be administered, so far as income tax\r\n\r\nis concerned, and what the amendments should be.\r\n\r\nPreviously the position was that any matter\r\n\r\naffecting the administration of income tax law - amendments or any other matters pertinent to\r\n\r\nincome tax - was always referred to the Malayan\r\n\r\nBoard of Income Tax for their advice and their\r\n\r\nviews.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a feeling, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if\r\n\r\nthis new section 3A is passed into law, we might\r\n\r\nas well write off section 7 from the Income Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance, that in future the Malayan Board of\r\n\r\nIncome Tax will cease to have any meaning\r\n\r\nwhatsoever under this Ordinance, and that the only\r\n\r\nthing it can do is probably to give ex-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nemptions to charities. So far as section 7 is\r\n\r\nconcerned, it will be absolutely hamstrung and the\r\n\r\nonly persons who would matter then in the\r\n\r\nadministration of the Ordinance would be the\r\n\r\nMinister here and the Minister in the Federation.\r\n\r\nIf it is the intention of the Minister here and\r\n\r\nthe Minister in the Federation that section 7\r\n\r\nshould be wiped out, then they are correct in\r\n\r\nadvocating this new clause. But they have not said\r\n\r\nso. So long as section 7 remains on the statute\r\n\r\nbook, it seems to, me that there is absolutely no\r\n\r\nneed for a new section 3A.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we took\r\n\r\noffice we found the Malayan Board of Income Taxis,\r\n\r\nas the Member for Farrer Park has stated, in a\r\n\r\nsomewhat peculiar position in that their\r\n\r\nfunctions, which were originally thought\r\n\r\nappropriate to them, had not in recent years been\r\n\r\nconsidered part of their normal functions. This\r\n\r\nmay have a long and complicated history, the\r\n\r\ndetails of which I am not aware, but it may be\r\n\r\nthat the Board itself already performed much of\r\n\r\nthe important matters, such as laying down\r\n\r\nprocedures and forms for the effective discharge\r\n\r\nof administration of the Income Tax Ordinance, and\r\n\r\nthat the other matters requiring decision at\r\n\r\nhigher levels could be discharged quite\r\n\r\neffectively at ministerial level. The Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park said that if you had one pan-Malayan\r\n\r\nco-ordinating body which is in a position to\r\n\r\ngive directives to the two administrations, then\r\n\r\nwhy is this new section 3A necessary? This section\r\n\r\nis necessary because it will not be possible to\r\n\r\nsend matters of temporary importance for the\r\n\r\nconsideration of the Board. May I give an example?\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned in my speech during the\r\n\r\nSecond Reading of this Bill that, in order to\r\n\r\ncombat effectively tax evasion, it is necessary to\r\n\r\nmake the public more conscious of the effect of\r\n\r\ntax evasion upon themselves. This is a matter in\r\n\r\nwhich the political leadership rather than the\r\n\r\nadministration must provide the leadership and\r\n\r\ninitiative. At the same time, when we are\r\n\r\norganising a campaign against income tax evasion,\r\n\r\nit is necessary to co-ordinate the campaign with\r\n\r\nthe policy of the Income Tax Department. Clearly,\r\n\r\nthis is not a function which could\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbe referred to the Malayan Board of Income Tax,\r\n\r\nbecause it deals with a situation which is\r\n\r\nchanging very rapidly from month to month, perhaps\r\n\r\nfrom week to week.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, although the general laws relating to\r\n\r\nincome tax and even specific rules made under the\r\n\r\nOrdinance should be uniform in the two\r\n\r\nterritories, it does not mean that the\r\n\r\nimplementation should be identical. I have already\r\n\r\nreferred to the fact that the higher rates of\r\n\r\npersonal relief in Singapore would mean that in\r\n\r\nthe application of the powers of exemption under\r\n\r\nclause 6 of this Bill, the Comptroller in\r\n\r\nSingapore would have much greater freedom to grant\r\n\r\nexemptions.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as my colleague, the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand Law, has pointed out, these directives are of\r\n\r\na general character and they should not be\r\n\r\ninconsistent with the provisions of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\nI can see no objection whatsoever to the clause as\r\n\r\nit stands.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in replying the\r\n\r\nMinister made the point that clause 2 is necessary\r\n\r\nas part of the campaign to get more tax and to\r\n\r\nmake the public more conscious that Mr A is\r\n\r\nevading tax, and that he should not be assisted in\r\n\r\nthe evasion because, by that, the law-abiding\r\n\r\ncitizen - the man who does his duty to the State - is\r\n\r\nbeing made to pay for Mr A who is evading it.\r\n\r\nThat is not something which any legislation can\r\n\r\ntake care of and certainly this particular income\r\n\r\ntax legislation does not even seek to do it. No\r\n\r\nlegislation can do it. You may remember, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the very interesting debates we have\r\n\r\nhad about how Ministries should have their roots\r\n\r\nin the masses of the people and why it was\r\n\r\nnecessary to have Political Secretaries. To bring\r\n\r\nhome to the public the policies of a particular\r\n\r\nMinistry or a department, it was necessary to have\r\n\r\na Political Secretary. Well, a job like this, I\r\n\r\nsuggest with respect to the Minister, is something\r\n\r\nwhich his Political Secretary might adequately do.\r\n\r\nWho can say that he will not be able to accomplish\r\n\r\nit thoroughly? But for a Minister to seek to take\r\n\r\non to himself a job which can be done more\r\n\r\nefficiently and more adequately by his Political\r\n\r\nSecretary - I do not think I can take this any\r\n\r\nfurther, Sir,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nexcept to say this, that the effect of the new\r\n\r\nsection 3A - I am prophesying this - will be to kill\r\n\r\nthe usefulness of the Malayan Board of Income Tax,\r\n\r\nexcept in two aspects : these are two separate\r\n\r\nfunctions where they are called upon to exempt\r\n\r\ncertain charities or pronounce on certain\r\n\r\ninstitutions regarding whether any contribution to\r\n\r\nthose societies would be exempted from income tax.\r\n\r\nExcept in regard to those two matters, the Malayan\r\n\r\nBoard of Income Tax will cease to have any useful\r\n\r\npurpose. If it is the intention of both the Gov\r\n\r\nernments to lay to rest the Malayan Board of\r\n\r\nIncome Tax, no appropriate section other than the\r\n\r\npresent one can be framed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we on this side of\r\n\r\nthe House are very accustomed to the prophecies of\r\n\r\nthe people who are members of the Singapore\r\n\r\nPeople's Alliance.

I think the Member\r\n\r\nfor Farrer Park suggested just now that if it was\r\n\r\nwritten into the law that the Minister may not\r\n\r\ngive directions which are inconsistent with the\r\n\r\nrules that are made under this Ordinance, then he\r\n\r\nwould be satisfied.

With the new\r\n\r\nsubsection (8), Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no\r\n\r\nquarrel. But with regard to the new subsection\r\n\r\n(9) , what it seeks to do is to give the\r\n\r\nComptroller this power:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\". . . the Comptroller may produce or cause to\r\n\r\nbe produced in any Court, in any proceedings\r\n\r\nrelating to income tax, a copy of any particulars...\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Mark the phrase, Mr Speaker -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... a copy of any particulars contained in\r\n\r\nany document or return transmitted to him by the\r\n\r\nComptroller of Income Tax, Federation of Malaya,\r\n\r\nunder the provisions of any law in force in the\r\n\r\nFederation corresponding to the provisions of\r\n\r\nsubsection (8) of this section, certified by the\r\n\r\nComptroller or on his behalf to be a correct copy\r\n\r\nof such particulars:\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that there will be corresponding\r\n\r\nlegislation in the Federation. If as a result of a\r\n\r\nrequest made by the Comptroller here to the\r\n\r\nComptroller in the Federation, a letter is sent to\r\n\r\nthe Comptroller in Singapore setting out certain\r\n\r\nparticulars in the body of the letter, and if it\r\n\r\nis necessary for those particulars to be produced\r\n\r\nin Court, then all that would be necessary for the\r\n\r\nComptroller to do would be to extract the\r\n\r\nparticulars, type them on a piece of paper and\r\n\r\nproduce them in Court as evidence, and the Court\r\n\r\nhas to accept them without question, except under\r\n\r\nthe provison where it says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(a) the Comptroller may produce or cause to be\r\n\r\nproduced the original of any such document or\r\n\r\nreturn in any case when it is necessary to prove\r\n\r\nthe handwriting or the\r\n\r\nsignature of the person who wrote, made, signed or\r\n\r\nfurnished such return or document,\r\n\r\nbut only for the purpose of such proof;\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>So that if the Court insists on knowing whether it\r\n\r\nwas the Comptroller who signed it, then that\r\n\r\nletter or document will be produced only for the\r\n\r\npurpose of proving that it was signed by the\r\n\r\nComptroller. So far as the copy of the particulars\r\n\r\nis concerned, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is quite clear - \r\n\r\nat least to my mind -  from this section that nobody\r\n\r\ncan inspect the original document which was\r\n\r\nreceived by the Comptroller in Singapore with a\r\n\r\nview to checking whether the typewritten copy\r\n\r\nproduced in Court is the same as the particulars\r\n\r\nset out in the original document. That is as I\r\n\r\nread it. If my reading of that section is\r\n\r\nincorrect, Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be glad to\r\n\r\nhear of it. But I cannot understand why the\r\n\r\nComptroller cannot produce the original document\r\n\r\nin Court. It is not a State secret. It is\r\n\r\nsomething dealing with an individual taxpayer who\r\n\r\nhas perhaps been evading tax. The Comptroller in\r\n\r\nthe Federation has given the Comptroller in\r\n\r\nSingapore certain information. On that information\r\n\r\ncertain Court proceedings ensue. Why all this\r\n\r\nsecrecy? Why cannot that document be produced in\r\n\r\nCourt? That is all I ask. Why go to this\r\n\r\nsubterfuge and say, \"You shall, only produce the\r\n\r\noriginal document to prove the signature, but not\r\n\r\nthe contents. Also you cannot inspect the contents\r\n\r\nand you will have to be satisfied with\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\na copy of the particulars produced by the\r\n\r\nComptroller's Department purporting to be a copy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd on such a serious matter as this, apparently\r\n\r\nit could be certified by the Comptroller \"or on\r\n\r\nhis behalf\". The matter is so important in this\r\n\r\ncase that if you must have a copy, then at least I\r\n\r\nthink only the Comptroller should be allowed to\r\n\r\nsign it and not by someone \"on his behalf\". If for\r\n\r\nsome reason or other - perhaps the Minister might\r\n\r\ntell us - it becomes necessary to do this, then I\r\n\r\nsuggest that this should be exercised very\r\n\r\ncarefully, and the only person who should be\r\n\r\nallowed to certify it should be the Comptroller\r\n\r\nhimself and not anybody on his behalf, because I\r\n\r\nthink it would not be right that in an important\r\n\r\nmatter such as this some officer in his Department\r\n\r\nshould certify it as correct when it might not be\r\n\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would be glad for some information as to\r\n\r\nthe necessity for this new section to be drafted,\r\n\r\nwhereas in the normal course, under the Evidence\r\n\r\nOrdinance, the production of the original document\r\n\r\nwould be obligatory.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, not being a\r\n\r\nlawyer, I am not fully conversant with the details\r\n\r\nof thee law of evidence, but it seems to me that\r\n\r\nthe Member for Farrer Park used rather strong\r\n\r\nlanguage when he referred to the provisions of\r\n\r\nthis section as amounting to subterfuge. Surely in\r\n\r\nthese matters where documentary evidence has to be\r\n\r\nproduced in Court the officials responsible can be\r\n\r\nrelied upon to act with integrity. There are\r\n\r\nprobably very strong reasons why the originals\r\n\r\ncould not be produced in Court. Let us not forget\r\n\r\nthat the two administrations are separate in the\r\n\r\nsense that they are run by Governments with\r\n\r\nseparate\r\n\r\npolitical identities, and it will therefore be a\r\n\r\nvery serious departure from normal practice for a\r\n\r\ndepartment of one Government to send the original\r\n\r\nreturns and documents belonging strictly to itself. This section tries to bring about a better\r\n\r\ndegree of co-ordination between the two\r\n\r\nGovernments in the two territories in regard to\r\n\r\nproceedings in Court and I am quite satisfied that\r\n\r\nthe provisions go as far as possible under the\r\n\r\nexisting circumstances.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I add to what my\r\n\r\nfriend and colleague has said by drawing the\r\n\r\nattention of the Member for Farrer Park to the\r\n\r\nEvidence Ordinance which he knows quite well? All\r\n\r\nofficial secrets are protected from disclosure in\r\n\r\nthe Courts and the permission of the Head of State\r\n\r\nhas to be obtained before any of that official in\r\n\r\nformation can be disclosed in a court of law. The\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park knows very well that\r\n\r\nprovision of the Evidence Ordinance. This\r\n\r\nparticular section refers to official information\r\n\r\nthat is passing from one Comptroller to another\r\n\r\nabout, say, tax evasion and all that sort of\r\n\r\nthing. Under these provisions, the original\r\n\r\ndocument can only be produced when there is a\r\n\r\ndoubt as to the authenticity of that document,\r\n\r\nthat is, when there is a question as to whether\r\n\r\nthat document is a bona fide document, and it is\r\n\r\nnecessary to establish the source of that\r\n\r\ndocument. The question of handwriting arises and\r\n\r\nthat is why such a document can be produced in\r\n\r\nCourt when it is necessary to prove \"the\r\n\r\nhandwriting or the signature of the person who\r\n\r\nwrote, made, signed or furnished such return or\r\n\r\ndocument, but only for the purpose of such proof\".\r\n\r\nThe contents of that document are protected from\r\n\r\ndisclosure and it would be within the discretion\r\n\r\nof the Comptroller to certify what particulars may\r\n\r\nbe disclosed. It is not necessary for him to\r\n\r\ncertify that himself. He could leave it also to an\r\n\r\nofficial to do so on his behalf. That is all that\r\n\r\nthe section says. I can see no difficulty in that,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> With great respect to the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour and Law, I do not agree with him. I am\r\n\r\nsuggesting to him that it is necessary for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to frame this section as it has been\r\n\r\nframed, because of the simple reason that by\r\n\r\nvirtue of the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance\r\n\r\nsuch a thing could not have happened. Because if\r\n\r\nit is an official secret, if it is a document cov\r\n\r\nered by the Official Secrets Ordinance, then, of\r\n\r\ncourse, it will be covered by it and it need not\r\n\r\nbe produced. This section, Mr Speaker, Sir, has\r\n\r\nbeen framed in order to give protection to the\r\n\r\nComptroller where he does not otherwise have\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nprotection under the existing law. That is why\r\n\r\nthis section is necessary. Now to say that there\r\n\r\nis already protection for such a document, and\r\n\r\nthen to suggest that the new section makes doubly\r\n\r\nsure of that, we are providing this section to my\r\n\r\nmind, if I may say so, that is absurd. This\r\n\r\nsection is intended to perform a specific\r\n\r\nfunction. Without this section, the original\r\n\r\ndocument would become producible in Court and no\r\n\r\nbody could then have said, \"I heard from the\r\n\r\nComptroller in the Federation that such and such\r\n\r\nis the position.\" That would be hearsay evidence\r\n\r\nand that would not be admissible in Court. What\r\n\r\nthis section seeks to do is to get over the\r\n\r\nhearsay rule by saying that the production of a\r\n\r\ncopy shall be admissible in Court. If it is a\r\n\r\ndocument relevant to an official secret, it is\r\n\r\nalready protected under the existing law, and this\r\n\r\nsection is not necessary. This section only\r\n\r\nbecomes necessary because the particular document\r\n\r\nsought to be put before the Court has not got the\r\n\r\nprotection of the Official Secrets Ordinance. That\r\n\r\nis why this is necessary.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance says, \"Because it is a Federation Government letter - perhaps because of\r\n\r\nsome protocol or something like that - that document\r\n\r\nis prevented from being produced in Court.\" Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I am not an expert on those matters.\r\n\r\nI am only a poor humble lawyer and I only know\r\n\r\nwhat is evidence in Court and what is not evidence\r\n\r\nin Court. When a man is being charged in Court, I\r\n\r\nonly know that the best evidence should be pro\r\n\r\nduced against him when it is available. The\r\n\r\ndocument is available and if a person who is being\r\n\r\ncharged by virtue of the information contained in\r\n\r\nthat evidence might be able to refute the charge,\r\n\r\nthen it is only fair that that document should be\r\n\r\nproduced in Court. Mr Speaker, Sir, even if the\r\n\r\nGovernment say that it is because of protocol or\r\n\r\nfor some reason or other which they have not yet\r\n\r\nexplained that such a document cannot be produced\r\n\r\nin Court, and only a copy of the particulars\r\n\r\ncontained in the document can be produced, they\r\n\r\nhave yet to answer my question: why is it\r\n\r\nnecessary for a mere official in the De-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npartment to sign on behalf of the Comptroller?\r\n\r\nWhy cannot the Comptroller sign it himself? I dare\r\n\r\nsay, Sir, that not more than three or four cases\r\n\r\nwould go to a Court in one year on a particular\r\n\r\ndocument like this. Not only must justice be done,\r\n\r\nbut it must also be seen to be done. In a case\r\n\r\nlike this where the State is departing from the\r\n\r\nnormal accepted code of evidence, I think the\r\n\r\nGovernment should try to see that all loose ends\r\n\r\nare properly tied up and that there is no\r\n\r\npossibility of any sort of error. What I am\r\n\r\nseeking by this amendment is to give this power of\r\n\r\ncertification only to the Comptroller and not to\r\n\r\nanybody else.

Disclosure\r\n\r\ncan be made only when the permission of the Head\r\n\r\nof State is sought and obtained. That is the\r\n\r\ngeneral principle. The hon.

The Ordinance provides for that\r\n\r\ndisclosure. Only relevant particulars which are\r\n\r\ncertified by the Comptroller may be disclosed.\r\n\r\nThere might be circumstances when the Comptroller\r\n\r\ncannot certify this himself. He may be away.

I am not challenging\r\n\r\nwhat he has said. What I have done is this. I have\r\n\r\naddressed my arguments to this House under two\r\n\r\nheads. It is difficult to understand why the\r\n\r\noriginal document cannot be produced. If it cannot\r\n\r\nbe produced for some very good reason which the\r\n\r\nGovernment may advance, then please tell the House\r\n\r\nwhy the Comptroller himself cannot certify as\r\n\r\ncorrect the copy to be produced in Court.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may well be that, on the first point,\r\n\r\nthey have answered that for reasons of protocol or\r\n\r\nsome other reason, the Federation Government might\r\n\r\nobject to its Comptroller's letter being produced\r\n\r\nin our Courts. All right, I will accept that\r\n\r\nargument. But what is the reply to my second\r\n\r\nquestion which I put to the Government, that is,\r\n\r\nwhy is it necessary for the letter to be certified\r\n\r\non his behalf? Why cannot the Comptroller do it\r\n\r\nhimself or his deputy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when two\r\n\r\nlawyers enter into an argument about the law, the\r\n\r\nlayman joins in at his own peril.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park asked two straight\r\n\r\nquestions. First, why cannot the original\r\n\r\ndocuments be produced? I have explained at great\r\n\r\nlength that these are documents belonging to two\r\n\r\nseparate Governments. It is quite different if,\r\n\r\nsay, someone in England were charged in the City\r\n\r\nof Manchester for tax evasion. The files then are\r\n\r\nin the Inland Revenue Department in London. It is\r\n\r\na simple matter for the original documents to be\r\n\r\ntransmitted. But here there are two separate\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nGovernments, two separate political entities, and\r\n\r\ntherefore it cannot be assured that in every\r\n\r\ninstance the administration in one territory is\r\n\r\nwilling to part with the original documents which\r\n\r\nare most valuable records in its Income Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment. That answers the first point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his second point - why the Comptroller\r\n\r\ncannot certify these copies  - my answer is there is\r\n\r\nno reason why he should not. There is nothing in\r\n\r\nthis Ordinance to say that the Comptroller must\r\n\r\nnot certify the correct copy. In the detailed work\r\n\r\nof administration, surely some discretion must be\r\n\r\nleft to the Comptroller - whether he thinks the case\r\n\r\nor the documents are important enough to warrant\r\n\r\nhis own signature or whether he can leave it to\r\n\r\nhis Deputy or his assistants. I have a feeling\r\n\r\nthat in regard to the second issue, the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park is not really raising any matter of\r\n\r\nprofound importance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, with due respect to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance, I really think I am raising an issue\r\n\r\nof fundamental importance in the administration of\r\n\r\njustice, as I see it. I accept the Minister's\r\n\r\nstatement, Sir, that because of State reasons the\r\n\r\noriginal documents cannot be produced. For the\r\n\r\npurposes of my argument, I accept that. But the\r\n\r\nlaw, as it is framed here means this: that if\r\n\r\nthat particular document contains certain particulars relevant in the prosecution of a tax\r\n\r\nevader, then all that need be done\r\n\r\nis for those particulars to be copied on to\r\n\r\nanother sheet of paper and certified by the\r\n\r\nComptroller or somebody on his behalf. Now, nobody\r\n\r\non the side of the evading taxpayer has an\r\n\r\nopportunity to compare whether the particulars set\r\n\r\nout on the copy are correct; whether the particulars are set out word for word; or whether\r\n\r\nthere has been any mistake. Nobody has the\r\n\r\nopportunity to do that. Under normal conditions a\r\n\r\ndefendant or\r\n\r\nan accused person has the opportunity of\r\n\r\ninspecting the original and comparing it with the\r\n\r\ncopy to see that the copy is correct. In this\r\n\r\nparticular instance, he has not got the\r\n\r\nopportunity. All I am asking the Minister is this: since the matter is of such fundamental\r\n\r\nimportance to the taxpayer, the person who\r\n\r\ncertifies it as\r\n\r\ncorrect must be a very high official, or the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhighest official in the Department, i.e. the\r\n\r\nComptroller himself. Because the Comptroller will\r\n\r\nsee that the copy which goes out under his hand\r\n\r\nhas been compared by him and he will himself\r\n\r\ncertify it as correct. Whereas under the new\r\n\r\nsubsection as it now stands, if anybody certifies\r\n\r\nthe copy for and on behalf of the Comptroller,\r\n\r\n\"XYZ (Signature illegible)\", apparently it is\r\n\r\nadmissible in Court. That is not my idea of\r\n\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nunderstand what we are quarreling about. The\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"Comptroller\" in the Income Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance says:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\"Comptroller\" means the Comptroller appointed\r\n\r\nunder section 5  of  this Ordinance and\r\n\r\nincludes, for all purposes of this Ordinance\r\n\r\nexcept the exercise of the powers conferred\r\n\r\nuponthe Comptroller by sections 95, 96 and 99 of\r\n\r\nthis Ordinance, a Senior Assistant Comptroller\r\n\r\nor an Assistant Comptroller so appointed;\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore, it means that the Comptroller, or any\r\n\r\nSenior Assistant Comptroller or Assistant\r\n\r\nComptroller on his behalf, can sign and certify\r\n\r\nthe documents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park seriously say here in this Assembly\r\n\r\nthat we are doing something foolish in allowing a\r\n\r\ndiscretion to the Comptroller to nominate officers\r\n\r\nto certify documents on his behalf? Does he\r\n\r\nseriously say that the Comptroller would allow a\r\n\r\npeon in his Department to certify such\r\n\r\nparticulars?\r\n\r\nIs he seriously saying all that? Surely the\r\n\r\nComptroller is given discretion in this matter.\r\n\r\nThere must be somebody to certify these documents\r\n\r\nwhen the Comptroller himself may not be here. He\r\n\r\nmay be away and there might be a real occasion\r\n\r\nwhen the document must be produced to the Court,\r\n\r\nand there must be somebody to certify that those\r\n\r\nparticulars\r\n\r\nare a true and correct copy of the original\r\n\r\ndocument. Now, it would be a responsible official\r\n\r\nwho will so certify. He would have to look at the\r\n\r\noriginal document. He would have to look at the\r\n\r\ntypewritten document. He would have to compare\r\n\r\nboth documents, word for word. And only when he is\r\n\r\nsatisfied that it is a correct copy of the\r\n\r\nparticulars will he then certify.

I might also say to him, with equal\r\n\r\nrespect, that the laws of a country should not\r\n\r\nalso be framed in such a way as to, lead to\r\n\r\nfantastic results. What I am saying is that the\r\n\r\nlaw, as it is framed here, might easily lead to\r\n\r\nthat, and yet be lawful.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I am obliged to the Member for Redhill [sic]\r\n\r\nfor drawing the attention of the House to the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"Comptroller\" in section 2, which\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\"Comptroller\" means the Comptroller appointed\r\n\r\nunder section 5 of  this Ordinance and includes,\r\n\r\nfor all purposes of this Ordinance except the\r\n\r\nexercise of the powers conferred uponthe\r\n\r\nComptroller by sections 95, 96 and 99 of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance, a Senior Assistant Comptroller or an\r\n\r\nAssistant Comptroller so appointed;\"'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>So, Mr Speaker, Sir, even under the definition of\r\n\r\n\"Comptroller\", for purposes of sections 95, 96 and\r\n\r\n99, only the Comptroller himself can exercise\r\n\r\nthose functions. So you see the law is not being\r\n\r\nsuch an ass. It says, \"for the purposes of section\r\n\r\n95\", and section 95 is a provision for penalty for\r\n\r\nmaking incorrect returns. What I am suggesting, Mr Speaker, Sir, is: if the words in the new\r\n\r\nsubsection (9) did not have the words \"or on his\r\n\r\nbehalf\", then the effect of it would be that the\r\n\r\nComptroller could sign it, a Senior Assistant Com\r\n\r\nptroller could sign it, or an Assistant\r\n\r\nComptroller so appointed could sign it. What I am\r\n\r\nasking the Government to accept is this: that the\r\n\r\npower to sign\r\n\r\nas correct a copy of such particulars should be\r\n\r\nrestricted to the Comptroller himself, a Senior\r\n\r\nAssistant Comptroller or an Assistant Comptroller\r\n\r\nso appointed. That would be the effect of the\r\n\r\namendment. Mr Speaker, Sir, the words \"or on his\r\n\r\nbehalf\" must be given a meaning. It must mean that\r\n\r\nthe Government intends that persons other than the\r\n\r\nComptroller, the Senior Assistant\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nComptroller or an Assistant Comptroller so\r\n\r\nappointed can be allowed to sign. That is why the\r\n\r\nwords \"or on his behalf\" appear. All I am asking\r\n\r\nthe Government to consider is this: is it not fair\r\n\r\nin circumstances such as this, that only the\r\n\r\nComptroller as envisaged in the defining section\r\n\r\nof the Income Tax Ordinance should be allowed to\r\n\r\ncertify?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid\r\n\r\nI cannot quite follow the reasoning of the Member\r\n\r\nfor Farrer Park. He says his original objection\r\n\r\nwas to the effect that copies of documents and not\r\n\r\nthe originals are produced. Now, he is satisfied\r\n\r\nthat properly certified copies can be accepted as\r\n\r\nevidence in Court, provided that the Comptroller\r\n\r\nand not others certifies such copies. The Member\r\n\r\nhas quite lightly pointed out that in the\r\n\r\ndischarge of certain functions under the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, powers are exercisable only by the\r\n\r\nComptroller and not by a Senior Assistant\r\n\r\nComptroller or an\r\n\r\nAssistant Comptroller; in particular, he has cited\r\n\r\nsection 95. But surely there is a difference\r\n\r\nbetween the duties under section 95, and also in\r\n\r\nother sections which are only exercisable by the\r\n\r\nComptroller, and this particular business of\r\n\r\ncertifying a document.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 95 there is scope for the exercise of\r\n\r\ndiscretion, namely, the composition of offences\r\n\r\ncommitted under the section. In such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, I would agree that the Head of De\r\n\r\npartment should exercise this power wholly. But in\r\n\r\nthe case of certification of copies, surely in a\r\n\r\nDepartment with properly regulated rules,\r\n\r\ncertification by any of the Senior Officers\r\n\r\ndeputised by the Comptroller would be quite ade\r\n\r\nquate.

Sir, it has never been the conten\r\n\r\ntion of any government that tax avoidance is\r\n\r\nillegal. Tax avoidance is a perfectly legal thing.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter on which highly paid lawyers and\r\n\r\naccountants are engaged. There is absolutely\r\n\r\nnothing illegal about tax avoidance. It is tax eva\r\n\r\nsion which is illegal, and no lawyer or accountant\r\n\r\nworth his salt would advise his client to evade\r\n\r\ntax which is lawfully due under the Ordinance to\r\n\r\nthe government. So when lawyers advise their\r\n\r\nclients, it is on how to get round the Income Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance with a view to avoiding tax. That is\r\n\r\nperfectly legal. I think even the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance will accept that. And settlements up till\r\n\r\nnow have been legal. They have been stamped.\r\n\r\nGovernment is extracting stamp duty from them.\r\n\r\nThey have been registered in the Registry of\r\n\r\nDeeds. They have been perfectly legal documents.\r\n\r\nThey have operated to take away from the Govern\r\n\r\nment certain tax. The Government now\r\n\r\nthink that that should not be so, and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthey have therefore put in this clause 4 which\r\n\r\nwill bring in settlements for the purpose of\r\n\r\nincome tax. With that particular aspect of it, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I have no quarrel. It is with\r\n\r\nsubsection (5) which says this:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If any question arises as to the amount of any\r\n\r\npayment of income or as to any\r\n\r\napportionment of income under this section that\r\n\r\nquestion shall be decided by the Comptroller,\r\n\r\nwhose decision thereon shall be final.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>In other words, what this subsection seeks to do\r\n\r\nis to give the Comptroller power in respect of a\r\n\r\nparticular item of taxable income which he does\r\n\r\nnot have with regard to the other items of taxable\r\n\r\nincome, because every other taxable form of income\r\n\r\nis a matter on which the taxpayer could go to\r\n\r\nappeal, on the basis that the Comptroller was not\r\n\r\nright, or that he has based his assessment on in\r\n\r\ncorrect facts or figures. But apparently when it\r\n\r\ncomes to a settlement, any decision by the\r\n\r\nComptroller shall be final, and this, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, is completely not in keeping with the other\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Income Tax Ordinance. That is\r\n\r\nthe first point, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the second point is subsection (7) (a)\r\n\r\nregarding settlement\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"a settlement which in the opinion of the\r\n\r\nComptroller is made for valuable and adequate\r\n\r\nconsideration;\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>In other words, if the Comptroller says, \"In my\r\n\r\nopinion, this is made for valuable and adequate\r\n\r\nconsideration,\" that apparently is the last word\r\n\r\non the subject. There again there is no appeal to\r\n\r\nthe courts.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then thirdly in subsection (7) (c), on page 5,\r\n\r\nlines 11 and 12, are these words \"in the opinion\r\n\r\nof the Comptroller\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (7) (c) reads as follows:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"any agreement made by an employer to pay to an\r\n\r\nemployee or to the widow or any relative or\r\n\r\ndependant of such employee after his death such\r\n\r\nremuneration or pension orlump sum as in the\r\n\r\nopinion of the Comptroller is fair and\r\n\r\nreasonable;\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>There again he has undisputed powers of saying\r\n\r\nwhat is fair and reasonable, and that apparently\r\n\r\nis the end of the matter.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think these are matters which\r\n\r\nshould be treated similarly as other items of\r\n\r\ntaxable income\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nare treated.

I would urge upon the Government that\r\n\r\nthe words \"in the opinion of the Comptroller\"\r\n\r\nshould be omitted from \"settlement\" in subsection\r\n\r\n(7) (a) and the words \"in the opinion of the\r\n\r\nComptroller\" should be omitted from subsection (7)\r\n\r\n(c). I would also urge upon the Government that\r\n\r\nsubsection (5) should be amended in such a way as\r\n\r\nto leave out the words \"whose decision thereon\r\n\r\nshall be final\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, can we go on to\r\n\r\nfurther clauses and come back to this one later?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Strictly, of course, under Standing\r\n\r\nOrder 71, paragraph (7):\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A clause may be postponed, unless a decision has\r\n\r\nalready been taken upon an\r\n\r\namendment thereto.

To take an instance of a coffee shop.\r\n\r\nAll coffee shops carry on under eating-house\r\n\r\nlicences. I understand there are well over a\r\n\r\nthousand of such coffee shops carrying on under\r\n\r\neating-house licences. The coffee shop proprietor,\r\n\r\nI am told, runs his own business. He sells coffee,\r\n\r\ntea, Postum, Ovaltine, aerated water and\r\n\r\ncigarettes. As part of the establishment, there\r\n\r\nare a number of hawkers who sell their individual\r\n\r\nwares inside the shop under and by virtue of the\r\n\r\neating-house licence. Is it the intention of\r\n\r\nGovernment that all such hawkers who sell within\r\n\r\ncoffee shops should issue receipts? Because,\r\n\r\ntechnically speaking, they are all selling under a\r\n\r\nlicence issued to the proprietor of the coffee\r\n\r\nshop. Are all the sales arising from the sale of\r\n\r\nfood in that coffee shop to be credited to the\r\n\r\ncoffee shop owner, or will they be credited to\r\n\r\neach of the hawkers who is plying his wares in the\r\n\r\ncoffee shop?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Minister has said that certain\r\n\r\ncategories of persons would be exempted, I find\r\n\r\nthat once this section has been enacted, then all\r\n\r\npersons whose sales come to $18,000 and over would\r\n\r\nbe brought within its ambit, and it would be very\r\n\r\ndifficult for the Comptroller to make specific\r\n\r\nexemptions in certain cases.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the\r\n\r\nproposed 67 (2) which reads:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Comptroller may by notice in writing to any\r\n\r\nperson carrying on or exercising any trade,\r\n\r\nbusiness, profession or vocation, or by a notice\r\n\r\nin the Gazette in respect of any class or\r\n\r\ndescription of any such person, prescribe -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the form of the records to be kept under the\r\n\r\nprovisions of paragraph (a) of subsection\r\n\r\n(1) of this section, and the manner in which\r\n\r\nsuch records shall be kept and retained; and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the form of the receipts to be issued and\r\n\r\nthe duplicates to be retained under the\r\n\r\nprovisions of paragraph (b) of subsection (1)\r\n\r\nof this section, and the manner in which such\r\n\r\nreceipts shall be issued and such duplicates\r\n\r\nshall be retained,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>and every such person shall be bound to comply\r\n\r\nwith such notice.\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering, Mr Speaker, Sir, whether this\r\n\r\nfunction of keeping adequate records should not be\r\n\r\nleft to the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nBoard of Income Tax to prescribe rather than to\r\n\r\nthe Comptroller in the Federation or here, and\r\n\r\nwhether it could be more adequately dealt with by\r\n\r\nthe Board of Income Tax rather than the\r\n\r\nComptrollers in the two territories.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\nquite clear what was the purpose of the last\r\n\r\nincursion of the Member for Farrer Park into the\r\n\r\ndeliberations of this Committee.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think he will argue against the\r\n\r\nnecessity for businesses to account properly for\r\n\r\ntheir receipts.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did raise one or two questions, namely, in the\r\n\r\ncase of a coffee shop, whether the separate stalls\r\n\r\nthat operate on the premises would be lumped to\r\n\r\ngether as one business, or whether they would be\r\n\r\nconsidered separately; and, of course, the answer\r\n\r\nis that they would be considered separate units.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for passing on the authority of deciding how\r\n\r\nthe provisions of this clause should be\r\n\r\nadministered to the Malayan Board of Income Tax,\r\n\r\nmay I say that a pan-Malayan Board of this nature\r\n\r\ncannot meet often enough and long enough and go\r\n\r\ninto sufficient detail to give directives that\r\n\r\nwill be needed?

In so far as fraud or\r\n\r\ndeliberate evasion of income tax is concerned,\r\n\r\nthere is no time limit and the Comptroller can\r\n\r\ntake action at any time if a fraud is discovered.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that where an honest mistake has\r\n\r\nbeen made either by the Comptroller or by the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer, it is intended that the mistake should\r\n\r\nremain hanging over the taxpayer for a period of\r\n\r\n12 years, and not 6 years as it is now. Where the\r\n\r\nmistake has happened on the part of the\r\n\r\nComptroller, I find it difficult to see why he\r\n\r\nshould be given a further six years in which to\r\n\r\nrectify his error and charge the taxpayer with the\r\n\r\ntax that he had failed to tax him with in the\r\n\r\nfirst instance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which arises out of his\r\n\r\namendment, Sir, is that this would mean that every\r\n\r\nbusiness, which keeps accounts up to six years\r\n\r\nnow, would be obliged to keep them for 12 years,\r\n\r\nbecause if anything does occur after the 7th or\r\n\r\n8th year, the Comptroller is not going to listen\r\n\r\nto the statement, \"Well, I thought six years was\r\n\r\nthe limitation period and I have destroyed my\r\n\r\nbooks.\" It means an additional burden on the\r\n\r\npreservation of records for the purposes of income\r\n\r\ntax. I do not know why it is\r\n\r\nnecessary to fix it at 12 years. I would have\r\n\r\nthought, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if a mistake is to\r\n\r\nbe discovered, it would have been discovered\r\n\r\nwithin the 6 years. Beyond the 6th year and within\r\n\r\nthe 12th year I do not know what possible fresh\r\n\r\nevidence could be brought up, except what the\r\n\r\nMinister himself said in his speech on the Second\r\n\r\nReading, that because the tax office had not been\r\n\r\nsufficiently geared to its work, the assessment\r\n\r\nand collection of taxes had not been carried out\r\n\r\nin the way that it should\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhave been. So it seems to me that the real reason\r\n\r\nwhy 6 years is being amended to 12 years is that\r\n\r\nthe tax department has not been sufficiently\r\n\r\ngeared to do the job. Mr Speaker, Sir, I doubt\r\n\r\nvery much whether that is a sufficient reason to\r\n\r\nextend it from 6 to 12 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have dwelt\r\n\r\nat length in my speech on the Second Reading on\r\n\r\nthe reasons for this amendment and I have very\r\n\r\nlittle to add to it. I do, however, wish to remind\r\n\r\nthe Member for Farrer Park that the Income Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment is a comparatively new department and\r\n\r\nthat the work of income tax investigation is a\r\n\r\nhighly skilled one. The Department was no more\r\n\r\nthan 4 or 5 years old when the Korean War boom\r\n\r\nbroke out during which time enormous fortunes were\r\n\r\nmade and never properly recorded. The work of\r\n\r\ninvestigation takes many years to complete. In a\r\n\r\nyoung department such as the Income Tax Department\r\n\r\nwas then, it is quite natural - it is, in fact, to\r\n\r\nbe expected - that they could not possibly cope with\r\n\r\nthe problems an the scale which developed during\r\n\r\nthose years. It is not for me to apologise for\r\n\r\nanybody, because during that time the reins of\r\n\r\ngovernment were not in our hands. But we intend to\r\n\r\nstrengthen the Investigation Unit of the\r\n\r\nDepartment. Steps are being taken to have the\r\n\r\nofficers trained abroad, and when they develop\r\n\r\nsufficiently powerful muscles, there will be\r\n\r\nvictims for them to operate on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, there is no magic in\r\n\r\neither 6 or 12. I venture a\r\n\r\nguess that it was 6 in the first instance, because\r\n\r\nit followed the British Limitation Act, 1939. If\r\n\r\nthe Member for Farrer Park was sufficiently\r\n\r\ninterested to know what the Government of the\r\n\r\nFederation thought of the matter, he would have\r\n\r\nfound that they were in favour of keeping things\r\n\r\nopen till eternity. It was because we have, as our\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law, a man trained in the\r\n\r\njurisprudential principle that theoretically there\r\n\r\nshould be finality in the affairs of man that we\r\n\r\nhave left it at 12 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park begins with the\r\n\r\nassumption that the Income Tax Department consists\r\n\r\nof a lot of perverse types who would go out of\r\n\r\ntheir way to give offence and cause mischief\r\n\r\namongst a lot of innocent tax-paying citizens. Of\r\n\r\ncourse, he knows very well that that is not the\r\n\r\ncase. The Income Tax Department consists of\r\n\r\nofficials who are extremely sensitive to charges\r\n\r\nof undue harassing of the public. The only people\r\n\r\nlikely to be harassed are those who have not paid\r\n\r\ntheir taxes according to what they should have\r\n\r\ndone. Far from their being unable to produce\r\n\r\nrecords on the basis that they did not know that 6\r\n\r\nyears was not the end of all things, I think the\r\n\r\nproblem would be not just the production of\r\n\r\nrecords, but the credibility of the records. I ven\r\n\r\nture to hazard the guess that the people who are\r\n\r\nlikely to be affected by this clause, and for whom\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition are expressing such\r\n\r\ngrave concern, would not be worth the special\r\n\r\ntreatment which they hope would be afforded them\r\n\r\nby our leaving it at 6 years. The Income Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment should find out a mistake immediately\r\n\r\nafter it has been made. If the people concerned\r\n\r\nare good, honest tax-paying citizens like myself,\r\n\r\nthey would point out to the Income Tax Department\r\n\r\nthat they made a mistake the moment the letter\r\n\r\narrived.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I am not saying that the\r\n\r\nofficials in the Income Tax Department are a lot\r\n\r\nof ogres and goblins. I have met some very nice\r\n\r\npeople in the Income Tax Department, and they are\r\n\r\nquite human chaps who completely sympathise with\r\n\r\nyou but yet extract your teeth. That is their job.\r\n\r\nOf course, they have to extract teeth just like a\r\n\r\ndentist does, but although the extraction is\r\n\r\npainful, one does not say that they\r\n\r\nare inhuman. They are quite human chaps. They\r\n\r\nsympathise with you while it pains you, but they\r\n\r\nget on with their job.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point arises on this amendment, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. Under the existing Ordinance, six\r\n\r\nyears being the period\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nof limitation, some assessments have been barred\r\n\r\nby limitation from being further reopened. Is it\r\n\r\nthe intention of this particular clause to reopen\r\n\r\nall the assessments which are now barred by law?\r\n\r\nIf the Minister for Labour and Law will remember,\r\n\r\nhe went to some pains to explain to the House,\r\n\r\nwhen he was moving the Limitation Bill - Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, you may remember too - that everything that\r\n\r\nhad been put an end to\r\n\r\nby limitation at the time when the Bill was being\r\n\r\nmoved would not be revived by the new Limitation\r\n\r\nOrdinance. So might I ask the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nwhether such solicitude also is in his mind in so\r\n\r\nfar as taxpayers are concerned?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The brief answer is that we\r\n\r\nhave every intention of reopening the cases and\r\n\r\ncharging tax to the hilt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 9 stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It appears to me that perhaps\r\n\r\nclauses 9 and 10 could be taken together.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir.

I\r\n\r\nsuppose there is something to be said for that.\r\n\r\nBut there is also the other point of view which I\r\n\r\nshould like to put to the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a recent case where the income tax\r\n\r\nofficials - with a smile on their faces no doubt - \r\n\r\nassessed a particular gentleman in the \"small\" sum\r\n\r\nof $1.8 million or thereabouts. He took a serious\r\n\r\nview of this matter and he appealed. But that was\r\n\r\nin the good days before the amendment came into\r\n\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nSo naturally the payment of tax was stopped. But,\r\n\r\nof course, the Comptroller could have gone to the\r\n\r\nBoard of Review and got sufficient security.\r\n\r\nWhether he did that or not I do not know. But the\r\n\r\npoint of my story, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this :\r\n\r\nthat after eight days of hearing the appeal,\r\n\r\napparently the Board of Income Tax reduced his tax\r\n\r\nby a \"paltry\" sum of $1 million! If that\r\n\r\nparticular case had come up after this Bill had\r\n\r\nbeen brought into force, he would have had to pay\r\n\r\nhis $1.8 million which he might not have been able\r\n\r\nto pay, and therefore he would have been deprived\r\n\r\nof an appeal. It is not for me to say what would\r\n\r\nbe the consequences which would ensue\r\n\r\nthereafter. Whether he would have to face the\r\n\r\nbankruptcy court and whether the judge would be\r\n\r\nsympathetic to him, it is not for me to say. It is\r\n\r\npurely hypothetical. The Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\nsaid that there are $30 million outstanding today\r\n\r\nin the way of taxes in respect of which appeals\r\n\r\nhave been lodged. May, I, with respect, suggest to\r\n\r\nhim that the reason for the difficulties which he\r\n\r\nis facing is because his Department is not\r\n\r\nsufficiently geared to proceed with these appeals\r\n\r\nexpeditiously? It should be possible, Sir, for\r\n\r\nthese appeals to be proceeded with expeditiously.\r\n\r\nWhat I cannot understand is why the cases take\r\n\r\nyears and years before they are brought up for\r\n\r\nfinal hearing before the Board of Review. In a\r\n\r\nnormal civil suit, after filing a complaint, you\r\n\r\nget the case\r\n\r\nheard. The difficulties before the Board of Review\r\n\r\nare not the same as those\r\n\r\nbefore the civil court. There are no pleadings.\r\n\r\nThings are clear-cut. They\r\n\r\nshould be clear-cut - at least it seems to me. The\r\n\r\nissues have already been\r\n\r\ndetermined in the mind of the Comptroller and he\r\n\r\nshould be ready to go to the Board of Review quite\r\n\r\nquickly after disagreement between the taxpayer\r\n\r\nand himself. But for some reason or other,\r\n\r\napparently that cannot happen. This clause, as it\r\n\r\nis framed, Mr Speaker, Sir, might cause hardship\r\n\r\nin genuine cases. Could not this clause be so\r\n\r\nframed that, in the case of a frivolous appeal,\r\n\r\nthe Board could be given sufficient power to\r\n\r\npenalise such an ap\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npeal? Or where there is an appeal and the\r\n\r\nComptroller's decision is upheld, then the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer could be called upon to pay the rate of\r\n\r\ninterest from the date of raising the taxation up\r\n\r\nto the date of appeal? As the Minister has said,\r\n\r\nif that money had been invested at eight per cent\r\n\r\ninterest, it might have yielded so much. So why\r\n\r\nnot do something like that? Although the intention\r\n\r\nof the Government is to rake in the money, I think\r\n\r\nit must also accept the position that in a number\r\n\r\nof cases hardship could be created. I am\r\n\r\nsuggesting to the Government that they could\r\n\r\nalleviate that hardship and yet maintain their\r\n\r\nincome by charging a heavy rate of interest which\r\n\r\nthe Board would be allowed to charge in case the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Comptroller is upheld.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Farrer Park is\r\n\r\naware that there is a fundamental principle in\r\n\r\nmatters other than imprisonment, that no party\r\n\r\nshould, by the lodging of an appeal, prevent any\r\n\r\naward or order that was made from being executed\r\n\r\nagainst him. The only exception is where a person\r\n\r\nis to be imprisoned. Because it is not likely that\r\n\r\nhe will abscond where he can put up sufficient\r\n\r\nsurety that he would be present\r\n\r\nfor the bearing of his appeal, he is then let out\r\n\r\non bail. On principle, there is no reason why a\r\n\r\nparty should have an order or an award that has\r\n\r\nbeen made against him postponed just by the lodging of an appeal. There is provision here,\r\n\r\nprovided the Comptroller in his discretion\r\n\r\nconsiders that it is a valid point upon which\r\n\r\nthere could be some doubt - an honest bona fide\r\n\r\ndifference of opinion on assessment - to extend the\r\n\r\ntime limit for the payment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion put forward by the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park is impracticable. There is no\r\n\r\nappellate court which has the right to punish a\r\n\r\nfrivolous appeal as distinct from a non-frivolous\r\n\r\nappeal. You will then not only have to decide the\r\n\r\nrights and wrongs of a particular case, but you\r\n\r\nwill also have to decide whether it was frivolous\r\n\r\nor otherwise to have appealed. The only form of\r\n\r\npunishment that can be exacted from\r\n\r\nthe appellant is to make him pay the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncost. As has been explained by the Member for\r\n\r\nRedhill, the business of a lawyer is to stall. The\r\n\r\nlonger he stalls, the more interest capital earns,\r\n\r\neither in business, industry, stocks and shares or\r\n\r\nin general speculation. It is worth the\r\n\r\nspeculator's while to pay his lawyer, pay such\r\n\r\ncosts as are awarded against him, pay even the\r\n\r\ninterest if it is a moderate six per cent per\r\n\r\nannum - because, according to the pawnbrokers, one\r\n\r\ncan get 10.9 per cent interest per annum by\r\n\r\ninvesting with them - and still have something to\r\n\r\nshow for it. All reasonable appeals will be\r\n\r\nallowed. If the gentleman in question has a $1 mil\r\n\r\nlion estate, and it is an honest bona fide case, I\r\n\r\nam certain that he would receive due consideration\r\n\r\nfrom the Comptroller of Income Tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this passionate plea as to why there are no\r\n\r\nquick trials is, in my humble submission, a lot of\r\n\r\nhistrionics. As all members of the Bar know, there\r\n\r\nare no quick appeals, because the appellant is not\r\n\r\nvery anxious for a quick appeal.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to mention to the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister that the constituency of the Member\r\n\r\nreferred to is not Redhill but Bukit Merah.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I myself made the same mistake in\r\n\r\nrespect of the same person.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister accuses me, of histrionics.

The Comptroller thinks the taxpayer\r\n\r\nowes so much. In the eyes of the law, it is a\r\n\r\nmatter of opinion.

Being called upon to pay on\r\n\r\nthe opinion of the Comptroller should not penalize\r\n\r\nall I am saying is that at the stage when it is a\r\n\r\nmatter of opinion the taxpayer. If the opinion of\r\n\r\nthe Comptroller is right and the State has been\r\n\r\ndeprived\r\n\r\nof the use of that money for a year or two, then,\r\n\r\nof course, the taxpayer should be called upon to\r\n\r\npay a proper rate of interest on that money,\r\n\r\nthereby preventing any abuse of the processes of\r\n\r\nthe Court.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister says that the appellant should prosecute the appeal. Mr Speaker, Sir, can the\r\n\r\nComptroller not prosecute the appeal? There is\r\n\r\nnothing in the Ordinance to prevent him from doing\r\n\r\nthat. In fact, I should think that as the\r\n\r\nGovernment are at the losing end, they would\r\n\r\nprosecute the appeal and not let the initiative\r\n\r\nlie in the hands of the taxpayer. Naturally, if\r\n\r\nthe initiative were left in the hands of the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer, he would dodge. Why should he not?

From the very\r\n\r\nfact that there is no finality until the Court of\r\n\r\nAppeal has sat in judgment on a particular issue,\r\n\r\nit does not mean that an award then existing\r\n\r\nshould not be executed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Comptroller prosecuting the appeal, I\r\n\r\nthink it is a well-known\r\n\r\npractice at the Bar that, as between friends, as\r\n\r\nbetween brother advocates, as\r\n\r\nbetween the Comptroller of Income Tax and\r\n\r\nadvocates where they are reasonably\r\n\r\npolite to one another, a little amount of leeway\r\n\r\nis usually given. Such leeway can\r\n\r\nextend to six months, one year, or 18 months. All\r\n\r\nwe are saying now is, \"By\r\n\r\nall means let us do things in a civilized and\r\n\r\nleisurely manner.

As the proposed section is worded, it says\r\n\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"95.-(1) Subject to the provisions of PartXII of\r\n\r\nthis Ordinance, every person who -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) makes an incorrect return by omitting there\r\n\r\nfrom or understating therein any income of which\r\n\r\nhe is required by this Ordinance to make a return;\r\n\r\n[etc.] \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall pay a penalty equal to the amount of\r\n\r\ntax which has been undercharged in consequence of\r\n\r\nsuch incorrect return or information, or which\r\n\r\nwould have been so undercharged if the return or\r\n\r\ninformation had been accented as correct.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the incorrect return might have\r\n\r\nbeen an honest mistake.

First, it will be the hardest thing in\r\n\r\nthe world to prove that any act is done with a\r\n\r\nwilful intention. When it has been\r\n\r\npointed out to any taxpayer that such an omission\r\n\r\nhas been made, it is all too\r\n\r\neasy for him to say that he had forgotten, or that\r\n\r\nhe had made an oversight. Let us always remember\r\n\r\nthat the filling of an income tax return is not an\r\n\r\nunder\r\n\r\ntaking lightly to be embarked upon. It is a\r\n\r\ndischarge of a very serious social\r\n\r\nduty which the individual owes to society. If in\r\n\r\nthe course of discharging such a duty, and through\r\n\r\ncarelessness he fails to make a correct return (as\r\n\r\na result of which revenue suffers), then I think\r\n\r\nit is very just and proper that a penalty should\r\n\r\nbe imposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular section distinguishes between the\r\n\r\nmaking of incorrect returns with reasonable\r\n\r\nexcuse. The other offence where a person cannot\r\n\r\nprovide any reasonable excuse comes under\r\n\r\nsubsection (2) of section 95, and the penalties\r\n\r\nare correspondingly heavier.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if that is the\r\n\r\nintention of the Government, I must say it is very\r\n\r\nserious and very drastic.

I am sure\r\n\r\nthere must be cases where even the Comptroller\r\n\r\nwill admit that honest mistakes are made. Is it\r\n\r\nthe intention that such a person should be penal\r\n\r\nised because there are no two ways about\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nit?

Clause 4. Dr\r\n\r\nGoh.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Farrer Park raised the point as to the\r\n\r\npropriety of the proposed subsection (5) of the\r\n\r\nnew section 33A and certain paragraphs of subsec\r\n\r\ntion (7). Perhaps I may be permitted to explain\r\n\r\nthe purpose of these subsections and how they will\r\n\r\noperate in actual practice. If after the passage\r\n\r\nof this Bill\r\n\r\nwhich taxes income from certain types of\r\n\r\nsettlements, we get a situation where the settlor\r\n\r\nsays that the income is apportioned in another\r\n\r\nway, then the Comptroller has the authority to\r\n\r\ndecide what was the amount of payment of income\r\n\r\nand what was the apportionment of income between\r\n\r\nthe beneficiaries. It is easy to imagine that\r\n\r\nwhere you have, for instance, a settlement in\r\n\r\nfavour of, let us say, two relatives, A under 20\r\n\r\nyears of age and B aged 40. It might have been a\r\n\r\ncertain proportion right now. But after\r\n\r\nthe passing of the Bill, the proportion could\r\n\r\nquite easily be reversed in favour of B who is\r\n\r\nabove the income limit, thereby avoiding tax in\r\n\r\nthis manner. In such instances, the Comptroller's\r\n\r\nopinion on what the apportionment would be, would\r\n\r\nbe final, but not as regards the, quantum of the\r\n\r\nincome nor the amount of tax payable thereon. In\r\n\r\nthese matters, they can still be the subject of\r\n\r\nappeal to the Board of Review. It is necessary to\r\n\r\ngive the Comptroller such powers in order to\r\n\r\narrive at some finality in these matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as regards subsection (7) (a) and (7) (c),\r\n\r\nhere again the Comptroller will have the authority\r\n\r\nto decide whether or not, in respect of\r\n\r\nsettlements for which consideration has been given\r\n\r\nsuch consideration is adequate, fair or\r\n\r\nreasonable. These two subsections will give the\r\n\r\nComptroller the power to decide whether or not a\r\n\r\nsettlement would come within the provisions of\r\n\r\nclause 4. But whatever assessment the Comptroller\r\n\r\nmakes under this clause can be subject to appeal\r\n\r\nto the Board of Review. There are therefore\r\n\r\nadequate safeguards in this respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, in respect of subsection (5), I\r\n\r\nunderstood the Minister for Finance to mean that\r\n\r\nthe finality, so far as the Comptroller is\r\n\r\nconcerned, is in connection with the apportionment\r\n\r\nof income arrived at under the settlement between\r\n\r\nthe various beneficiaries. But my reading of\r\n\r\nsubsection (5) seems to take it further:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If any question arises as to the amount of any\r\n\r\npayment of income or as to any apportionment of\r\n\r\nincome under this section that question shall be\r\n\r\ndecided by the Comptroller,...\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>So that the decision of the Comptroller relates to\r\n\r\ntwo things, Mr Speaker - any income under the\r\n\r\nsettlement, and any apportionment of income under\r\n\r\nthis subsection. So the explanation given by the\r\n\r\nMinister, to my mind, Sir, only touches upon the\r\n\r\nsecond limb of the subsection and not upon the\r\n\r\nfirst limb.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to a settlement which, in the opinion\r\n\r\nof the Comptroller, is made for valuable and\r\n\r\nadequate consideration, the Minister said that the\r\n\r\ntotal assessment under the particular section in\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance would go to the Board of Review if\r\n\r\nthe taxpayer so desires. But what I was worried\r\n\r\nabout, Sir, is whether on this particular matter\r\n\r\nthe taxpayer could appeal against the decision of\r\n\r\nthe Comptroller. If the Comptroller says that it\r\n\r\nis made for valuable and adequate consideration,\r\n\r\napparently then it is not a settlement. Now, if he\r\n\r\nmakes a ruling on a particular settlement that is,\r\n\r\nmade for valuable and adequate consideration, does\r\n\r\nit then mean that that particular ruling cannot be\r\n\r\nchallenged?

As regards\r\n\r\nsubsection (5), if there is any apportionment of\r\n\r\nincome under a settlement, that would surely cover\r\n\r\nthe payment of income from that settlement. But\r\n\r\nthat does not prevent an appeal being lodged on\r\n\r\nthe total\r\n\r\nquantum of income as distinct from amounts payable\r\n\r\nunder the scheme of distribution as stated by the\r\n\r\nsettlor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, may I phrase my question in a\r\n\r\ndifferent way? Suppose there are nine items of\r\n\r\nincome on which the taxpayer is called upon by the\r\n\r\nComptroller to pay tax, and the ninth item is\r\n\r\nunder subsection (5). So far as the other eight\r\n\r\nitems are concerned, the taxpayer is in happy\r\n\r\nagreement with the Comptroller. The only item\r\n\r\nwhich he is disputing with the Comptroller is item\r\n\r\nnumber 9 which is covered by subsection (5). Would\r\n\r\nthe Minister say that in the circumstances which I\r\n\r\nhave now set out, the taxpayer would be at liberty\r\n\r\nto take the Comptroller on appeal to the Board?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The opinion of the Comptroller\r\n\r\nis final as regards the apportionment of income\r\n\r\nbetween different beneficiaries for the reasons\r\n\r\nwhich I have explained. But as regards the quantum\r\n\r\nof the total income arising from the settlement,\r\n\r\nthat is a case where an appeal could be made.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It may be that if the Comptroller\r\n\r\ndecides that the apportionment should go in a\r\n\r\ncertain way, then the rate of taxation might\r\n\r\nincrease.

In those circumstances,\r\n\r\nhaving agreed to the other eight items, and where\r\n\r\nthe decision of the Comptroller is against the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer in the sense that it is putting up his\r\n\r\nrate of assessment, would the taxpayer then be\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nable to go to appeal?

Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nless sophisticated people would feel assured by\r\n\r\nthis amendment which is an expression of\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention that these powers shall be\r\n\r\nexercised properly and responsibly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I was aghast, Sir, when I\r\n\r\nheard the Member for Farrer Park, purely for the\r\n\r\nsake of argument, contend that not only in his\r\n\r\nopinion does it not take the matter further, but\r\n\r\nthat, in fact, it enlarges the powers of the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Comptroller.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that were\r\n\r\nindeed the effect of the amendment, then let me\r\n\r\nsay that we would be very happy indeed. But as I\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nread it, Sir, it is a limitation. An official,\r\n\r\nacting bona fide, must satisfy himself that it is\r\n\r\nnecessary so to enter, in the execution of such\r\n\r\npowers as are vested in him in the public\r\n\r\ninterest, or in the execution of his duties.\r\n\r\nWhereas if there were no such limitation, then he\r\n\r\nwould enter willy nilly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of illustration, may I say this? Supposing\r\n\r\nwe send a scout to enter a territory. I should\r\n\r\nlike to believe that if the new section 65B stands\r\n\r\nas it is,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Comptroller shall at all times have full\r\n\r\nand free access ... \".\r\n\r\n<br><br>it means what it says. Words are given a natural\r\n\r\nmeaning. If you travel by aeroplane, then you go\r\n\r\nright in and take all the consequences. If not,\r\n\r\nyou walk in and say, \"I am a Member of the staff\r\n\r\nof the Comptroller of Income Tax. Produce your\r\n\r\nbooks.\" Whereas, the section as amended means that\r\n\r\nthe occupier of the land or the custodian of the\r\n\r\nbooks can say, \"Ah, but are you coming here after\r\n\r\ndue and proper consideration? Is your Comptroller\r\n\r\nor superior officer satisfied that it is necessary\r\n\r\nin the exercise of his duties and in the public\r\n\r\ninterest?\" Of the two positions, I would say that\r\n\r\nthe one with the wider scope would protect the\r\n\r\nofficial more.
