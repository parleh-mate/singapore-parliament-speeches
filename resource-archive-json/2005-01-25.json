The Securities and Futures Act (SFA) was enacted in October 2001.&nbsp;&nbsp; It sought to provide a legislative framework for a market and disclosure-based approach to regulating our capital markets.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also provided a single comprehensive rule book, reflecting trends towards industry consolidation and the blurring of boundaries between capital market products, for example, between unit trusts, investment-linked insurance policies and structured products.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the SFA was passed, we noted that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) would review the Act in the following few years to keep pace with developments in the capital markets.&nbsp; MAS embarked on a two-phase set of <p align=left>Column: 480</p>amendments to the SFA in 2003.&nbsp; The Securities and Futures (Amendment) Act 2003, which marked the first phase of amendments, implemented 12 recommendations of the industry-led Company Legislation and Regulatory Framework Committee (CLRFC).&nbsp; The CLRFC had been tasked to review and modernise the company law and regulatory framework in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It had suggested rationalising some of the rules in the SFA for offers of investments to make our capital markets more globally competitive.&nbsp; The first round of amendments also incorporated some technical amendments, in light of industry developments and feedback received since the implementation of the SFA in 2001.&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second phase of amendments, represented by the current Bill, implements the remaining recommendations of the CLRFC.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also making other substantive policy changes to the SFA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS invited feedback from the industry and the public on the proposed policy refinements in September 2003, and on the draft Bill in April 2004. Many respondents gave detailed comments.&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS has incorporated the feedback received into the Bill, where practicable and where they were in line with its regulatory objectives.&nbsp; MAS has posted detailed responses to the comments received during these consultations on its website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me first set out the basic thinking behind the amendments.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill aims to strengthen the foundations underpinning our market and disclosure-based regulatory regime.&nbsp;It aims at sound standards without excessive costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we seek to ensure high standards of transparency and fair dealing.&nbsp;&nbsp; These standards are pre-requisites for the continued growth and development of the markets.&nbsp;&nbsp; While they impose obligations on issuers of capital,<p align=left>Column: 481</p> market intermediaries and professionals, they ultimately benefit all participants in the capital markets.&nbsp;&nbsp; They enhance investor confidence, leading to more liquid and vibrant markets, which in turn lowers the cost of capital.&nbsp;&nbsp; A market-driven, disclosure-based approach also allows reputable market players to raise the bar over time, as they see competitive advantage in improving their standards of disclosure and fair dealing above the minimum standards prescribed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second objective of the Bill is to make our rules themselves&nbsp;clear and market-friendly so as&nbsp;to support the development of our markets.&nbsp; The Bill provides greater regulatory certainty to the industry in some key areas such as offers of investments.&nbsp; The approval process and ongoing requirements for markets and clearing facilities have also been further streamlined for new entrants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill introduces amendments to rules across a range of capital market activities&nbsp;- capital raising, the conduct of intermediaries, and the provision of clearing and settlement infrastructures.&nbsp; On capital-raising, the amendments redefine the scope of provisions concerning investment offers, refine the liabilities of professionals involved in capital raising and simplify some prospectus rules.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill fine-tunes the regulation of intermediaries in light of industry experience to date under the SFA.&nbsp;&nbsp; On markets and clearing facilities, the Bill calibrates the level of regulation to better match the different levels of systemic risk posed by different facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now go through the main amendments in the Bill.&nbsp; I will start with changes to our rules for capital-raising.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Capital raising rules</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Abolition of \"public offer\" (in relation to Offers of Investments)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the SFA currently imposes rules on the conduct of \"offers to the public\", <p align=left>Column: 482</p>by requiring public offers be accompanied by prospectuses.&nbsp; These rules aim to ensure that investors are provided with all material information needed to make informed investment decisions.&nbsp; However, as noted by the CLRFC, the phrase \"offer to the public\" is not defined in legislation.&nbsp; This can cause practical difficulties for issuers when structuring private and other exempted offerings.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As recommended by the CLRFC, the Bill removes the concept of&nbsp; \"offer to the public\" from the SFA.&nbsp; Instead, a prospectus will be required for all offers of investments unless they are specifically exempted.&nbsp; As a basic principle, such exemptions should only be given in limited circumstances where the cost of issuing a prospectus is not justified by the benefits of greater disclosure and investor protection.&nbsp; Our current regime already exempts offers that are not made available to retail investors, or where other safeguards exist to minimise the risk to the public interest.&nbsp; For example, where the information found in a prospectus may already be publicly available, as is the case for listed companies. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the CLRFC recommended two new \"safe harbours\" which would allow private placements and small offers to be made without a prospectus.&nbsp; These safe harbours provide legal certainty in the case of capital raising by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and helps them do so efficiently, without unnecessary regulatory costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; These safe harbours are essentially similar to those available in jurisdictions like the UK, Hong Kong and Australia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Private placement exemption (clause 72, new section 272B)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private placements are defined as offers made to 50 or fewer investors within any 12-month period.&nbsp; The CLRFC had recommended a limit of 20 investors.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, MAS received public feedback that this is too low, as not all persons <p align=left>Column: 483</p>offered the securities may accept the offer.&nbsp; We have decided to raise this figure to 50, which is also consistent with the practice in UK and Hong Kong.&nbsp; Given this limited reach, to no more than 50 investors, there will be no dollar cap on the amount that can be raised in each private placement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Small offer exemption (clause 72, new section 272A)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Small offers raising up to $5 million within any 12-month period are also exempted from prospectus requirements.&nbsp; Apart from the $5 million limit, a small offer can be made only to investors with an existing relationship with the offeror, or who have previously expressed an interest in the offer.&nbsp; In addition, there will be resale restrictions on securities purchased by a connected investor so as to ensure that offers made under the small offers exemption are not open to the public at large.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offers made under the private placement and small offers exemptions, if they are closely related, must be aggregated.&nbsp; This will prevent issuers from breaking up a single large offer into smaller ones which would individually satisfy the exemptions, so as to circumvent the rules.&nbsp; MAS will prescribe regulations to set out the factors determining which offers are closely related.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Debenture issuance programme</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 54 extends the validity period for base prospectuses for a debenture issuance programme from six months to 24 months.&nbsp; This addresses industry feedback that a six month period is too short when debentures are being continuously issued.&nbsp; Clause 46 will also allow the base prospectus to be updated<p align=left>Column: 484</p> in the absence of a current offer without triggering refund provisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Offer information statement</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, listed issuers are allowed to provide an offer information statement (OIS) instead of a full prospectus if they are offering securities which are similar to those already listed.&nbsp; Clause 77 extends the use of an OIS to all offers of securities by a listed entity.&nbsp; Listed issuers are already subject to requirements under the SFA to disclose all material information on a continuous basis.&nbsp; Investors would therefore have publicly available information to evaluate fresh offerings by the issuer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, an OIS is required for a renounceable rights issue only when the issuer is both listed and incorporated in Singapore.&nbsp; Under the new provision, an OIS will also be required for renounceable rights issues by foreign corporations which have a primary listing in Singapore.&nbsp; This recognises that the pool of Singapore shareholders for such issuers is likely to be significant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Prospectus liability for issue managers</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in a disclosure-based regime, the onus for accurate and meaningful disclosures is placed on issuers and their professional advisers.&nbsp; This is achieved by imposing liability on those responsible for preparing the prospectus.&nbsp; Currently, the offeror and its directors, as well as the underwriter, face criminal and civil liability for any material deficiencies in the prospectus, such as false and misleading statements or omissions of material information.&nbsp; Clauses 57 and 58 extend this prospectus liability to issue managers.&nbsp; This recognises the important role that issue managers play in bringing a company to list on SGX and in the preparation of the prospectus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Change in criminal liability</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 485</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, clause 57 also refines the existing criminal liability for persons other than the offeror and its directors.&nbsp; Currently, third-party intermediaries (such as underwriters) must demonstrate that they have conducted the necessary due diligence as a defence against any criminal charges for material deficiencies in a prospectus.&nbsp; Clause 57 removes this burden of proof on the part of intermediaries.&nbsp; Instead, the onus will be on the prosecution to demonstrate that an intermediary has acted recklessly or intentionally.&nbsp; This is intended to address concerns by the industry that they may be subject to criminal liability as a result of an inadvertent oversight, or because of deficient disclosures made by the offeror (or its directors).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the civil liability provisions in the SFA will continue to apply the due diligence test.&nbsp;&nbsp; Investors will still be able to institute civil action in Court against intermediaries to compensate them for losses sustained as a result of material deficiencies in the prospectus where underwriters and issue managers are unable to show that they have conducted the necessary due diligence.&nbsp; This way, the change in criminal liability will not compromise the ability of investors to seek recourse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Pre-deal research reports</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 55 will lift the current prohibition on issuing pre-deal research reports for international offers. Pre-deal research reports refer to reports that profile an issuer before an offer is made.&nbsp; Such reports are typically prepared by the intermediaries involved in the offer, such as the underwriter or issue manager, to stimulate interest in the offer.&nbsp; Previously, pre-deal research was prohibited because such reports are not subject to the same regulatory safeguards as prospectuses.&nbsp; There was concern that retail investors <p align=left>Column: 486</p>may rely on such reports instead of the registered prospectus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS recognises that this prohibition may have placed Singapore investors, particularly our institutional investors, at a disadvantage compared to foreign investors when subscribing to international offers.&nbsp; If an offer is made concurrently in a foreign jurisdiction that allows such reports, MAS will allow pre-deal research reports to be distributed to institutional investors in Singapore.&nbsp; To reduce the risk of information in the pre-deal research reports reaching the retail public, we will put in place safeguards.&nbsp; Among them, the reports must not be circulated to persons who are not institutional investors, especially the media.&nbsp; Issuers must also observe a two-week \"quiet period\" before a prospectus is lodged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Intermediaries</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Repeal of exemption for financial advisers</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me move on to other changes in rules relating to the conduct of intermediaries, besides the changes to the capital raising framework that I have just mentioned which concern them.&nbsp; The SFA currently exempts financial advisers licensed under the Financial Advisors Act from licensing under the SFA, in their conduct of SFA-regulated activities which are incidental to their financial advisory services.&nbsp; This&nbsp;reflects the principle of not requiring an entity to be licensed under two separate Acts.&nbsp; Clause 16 removes this generalised exemption.&nbsp; It was not our intention to allow financial advisers to conduct the full scope of SFA-regulated activities, such as the full scope of fund management activities.&nbsp; In its place, MAS will make explicit in Regulations the specific types of exemptions financial advisers require under the SFA to conduct their financial advisory business.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><I>Unsecured credit facilities to employees</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 lifts the current prohibition against licensees&nbsp;under the Securities and Futures Act &nbsp;granting unsecured credit facilities to their directors, officers, employees or representatives for trading purposes.&nbsp; This prohibition has posed practical difficulties to licensees such as stockbrokers.&nbsp; For example, staff who trade through their principals, ie, through their own companies,&nbsp;need to settle their securities transactions upfront, rather than in accordance with market rules.&nbsp; They do so to avoid situations where credit is inadvertently extended to them if settlement is delayed.&nbsp; The risk arising from allowing unsecured credit facilities is however minimal, as unsecured loans to directors, officers and employees are already capped at one year's emoluments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>False statements to MAS</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 will make it an offence for applicants for a licence under the Securities and Futures Act to submit any false statements to MAS without reasonable excuse.&nbsp; Currently, it is only an offence if the false statements are made knowingly and willfully.&nbsp; The Bill&nbsp;clarifies that false statements can be used as a reason for rejecting an application.&nbsp; For MAS to perform its regulatory role well, applicants should bear responsibility for ensuring that their submissions to MAS are accurate and truthful.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Key infrastructure</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Clearing facilities<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will now discuss the refinements to our regulatory framework concerning clearing facilities and markets.&nbsp; Entities engaging in clearing or settlement services are vital components in the infrastructure of the entire financial sector.&nbsp; Such clearing facilities currently require approval from MAS before commencing operations.&nbsp; However, <p align=left>Column: 488</p>the term \"clearing or settlement\" is not explicitly defined in the current SFA.&nbsp; Clause 106 introduces a definition for \"clearing or settlement\", which covers any of the activities comprising post-trade matching and confirmation, clearance and settlement.&nbsp; This gives greater clarity to the industry, and takes into account the broad-ranging nature of clearing and settlement activities.&nbsp; This is also consistent with recent practices in other developed markets where an entity may specialise in a specific aspect of clearing or settlement, but would still be subject to regulation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, MAS anticipates that such a comprehensive definition could potentially become too inclusive over time and dilute our approach of regulating and supervising an activity in line with the risks that it poses.&nbsp; To pre-empt such problems, the new Part III inserted by clause 4 also introduces a new designation approach for clearing facilities.&nbsp; Clearing facilities will have to notify MAS 60 business days before commencing their operations.&nbsp; MAS will only designate and regulate the&nbsp;clearing and settlement systems which are systemically important, so as to focus our regulatory resources where the risks are more significant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Markets (clause 4, new Part II)<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill likewise improves the provisions relating to markets.&nbsp; These changes will clarify MAS' intention to classify markets as approved exchanges or recognised markets depending on their systemic importance.&nbsp; The more systemically important markets will be categorised as approved exchanges.&nbsp; Recognised markets will typically be smaller-scale trading platforms or organised exchanges which are already regulated in&nbsp;reputable jurisdictions.&nbsp; Recognised market operators will be subject to a more limited set of mandatory regulatory provisions, although MAS still retains the flexibility to tailor conditions to each specified recognised market.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 489</p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, the key building blocks for a market and disclosure-based regime for the capital markets are in place, and are being enhanced with this Bill.&nbsp; However, the SFA will remain very much work in progress.&nbsp; With constantly evolving capital markets, MAS will continue to engage in discussions with industry practitioners, monitor developments in regulatory practices internationally, and keep our&nbsp;legislation relevant to competitive captial markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not alone in this process of continued refinement and reform of capital markets legislation.&nbsp; In Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission has been reviewing various aspects of its regulatory framework, less than a year after its Securities and Futures Ordinance came into effect in April 2003.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been a flurry of reforms in the United States, including major reforms regarding&nbsp;corporate governance and conflicts of interest on the part of analysts as&nbsp;found in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and in the managed funds industry.&nbsp; There have also been recent moves in the US to modernise the process of securities offers and update the regulation of markets to keep pace with technological and industry developments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital markets regulation in Singapore as around the world will have to continue to evolve&nbsp;in response to new developments and concerns, while allowing for innovation, liquidity and growth of the markets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the market-driven and disclosure-based regulatory regime that we have adopted is the most effective way of governing a modern and rapidly innovating capital market, with a growing range of investment offerings and a wide spectrum of investors with differing levels of risk tolerance.&nbsp; Market discipline is at the<p align=left>Column: 490</p> heart of this approach.&nbsp; The responsibility for making market discipline work is shared amongst all participants in the system, not just the regulator.&nbsp; In particular, the onus is on issuers and their professional advisers to provide meaningful, accurate and timely information to investors.&nbsp; The regulator, on its part, stands ready to take effective enforcement action when laws are breached or prescribed standards of market conduct are not upheld.&nbsp; But market discipline also means that investors have to accept the risks of a business failing for legitimate reasons, or an investment not performing up to expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the market and disclosure-based regulatory approach that underpins the Securities and Futures Act and the amendments that this Bill proposes will enhance confidence in our markets and encourage continued innovation and growth.&nbsp; The Bill continues MAS' efforts to establish a framework of laws, rules and standards that encourage complete and clear disclosure of information, markets that operate with integrity, intermediaries who deal fairly with their customers, consumers who are empowered and educated of the risks involved in investments and the regulator able to take effective enforcement when breaches occur.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me declare my interest, as I am working in a Committee that is trying to implement an alternative platform for listing of shares either through a private equity exchange or the over-the-counter (OTC) market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;OTC is one of the major initiatives that the Action Crucibles for Finance of<p align=left>Column: 491</p> ACE has been trying to implement for the last one year.&nbsp; We have heard so many times of local and small and medium companies who have problems raising funds at their growth stage, after they have completed their beginning stages of start-ups.&nbsp; The options available to them are limited to either&nbsp;getting banking loans or&nbsp;raising private equity.&nbsp; In some cases, companies end up seeking public listing or through an IPO.&nbsp; But because of their size and the stage of their development, they end up raising very little cash.&nbsp; And also at the end, because of the cost of maintaining&nbsp;a listing, it actually&nbsp;appears to them that they may have made a mistake because they are not actually able to handle a listing for long, being a small company with very little cash flow or capabilities.&nbsp; But because of the pressing needs of these companies, they are forced to take the route of a public listing.&nbsp; With the amendments in the Bill, together with the combination of the private placements and also the small offering exemptions, companies will now be able to seek an alternative route and that is if it can implement a private equity exchange or OTC type of&nbsp;market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is only one issue with the Bill that I have which, I believe, will make it unattractive&nbsp; for an OTC type of market to be put in place.&nbsp; This has got to do with new section 272A where there is a limit of $5 million to the amount that can be raised or traded for a period of 12 months for such an offering to be considered not a public offering.&nbsp; While this limit is fine for companies that are raising the funds, and it may also be fine for the investors who may have invested in the companies during such an offering,&nbsp;it is not workable for a market maker that is trying to make the OTC work simply because in the model that we think that it can work for an OTC, the market maker will have to create a very vibrant secondary market for such an OTC to be successful in any <p align=left>Column: 492</p>market.&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, a $5 million limit for the market maker will not work.&nbsp; So I hope that the Minister will consider making an exemption for market makers and exempt them from this $5 million limit for a period of 12 months in this Bill.&nbsp; If we can do this, I believe that the OTC market will work.&nbsp; And I feel that it is about time that we had such a market in place so that we can further improve the financing environment for our companies in Singapore.&nbsp; It will make Singapore a lot more attractive for companies, not just local companies but also small companies from around the world, to come down here, set up base and to raise funds, either through private placements, through banking loans, through public listing and now, perhaps, through an OTC type of market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I urge the Minister to consider revising this $5 million limit if he wants to see a successful OTC market developing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Ivan Png Paak Liang (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

On a point of clarification, I would like to ask the Minister whether this law or any other law will be amended so as to cover the offering of membership in clubs on a large scale, as occurred in&nbsp; a number of cases in our recent history and which have resulted in very unhappy experiences for members of the public who&nbsp;bought membership in those clubs.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Senior Minister,&nbsp;I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" &nbsp;<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Financial Advisers Act (\"FAA\") concurrent with the amendments to the Securities and Futures Act (\"SFA\") that have been moved today. It aims to ensure that the regulation of Financial Advisers remains business friendly, while still maintaining high standards that promote the fair treatment of customers.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 495</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The MAS has taken into account the feedback received from the industry and the public following public consultation on the draft Bill that was conducted in April 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Financial advisers play an important role in financial markets, particularly in servicing the retail markets. They are a key conduit by which a wide range of investment products&nbsp;- ranging from securities, to collective investment schemes like unit trusts, to life insurance policies&nbsp;- are introduced and marketed to investors.&nbsp; The FAA was introduced to provide a regulatory framework for such market intermediaries that would support high levels of professional standards across the industry.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the key amendments that are proposed in the Bill.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Excluding generally circulated advice from reasonable basis requirement</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;First, clause 15 allows MAS to exclude generally circulated advice from the reasonable basis requirement.&nbsp; Financial advisers are required under the FAA to have a reasonable basis for their recommendations.&nbsp; They must take into account&nbsp;each client's investment objectives, financial situation and particular needs when giving advice or making a recommendation on an investment product. The reasonable basis requirement should not, however, be applicable in situations where the advice provided is not targeted at any specific person.&nbsp; Such \"generally circulated advice\" may, for example, be made via marketing brochures or given at seminars and workshops.&nbsp; The criteria for what constitute generally circulated advice will be set out in Regulations.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 496</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Extending the scope of MAS' inspection to exempt entities</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Second, the Bill allows the MAS to inspect exempt entities.&nbsp; Exemptions from licensing and business conduct requirements are currently given to entities that pose minimal risks.&nbsp; Limitations are imposed on the scope of financial advisory services that such entities can undertake.&nbsp; For instance, they are not to undertake any marketing of collective investment schemes or arrange any life insurance contract.&nbsp; Currently, MAS does not have explicit powers to inspect such exempt entities to ensure that they keep to the limitations imposed.&nbsp; To enhance its regulatory oversight and to ensure consistency with the SFA, clause 12(f) empowers MAS to inspect these exempt entities.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Extending MAS' powers to issue Prohibition Orders</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Next, powers to issue Prohibition Orders. MAS currently has the power to issue a Prohibition Order against undesirable persons to bar them from providing financial advisory services in Singapore.&nbsp; The Act currently sets out certain criteria upon which MAS may issue such an Order.&nbsp; These include where MAS suspends or revokes the licence held by the person, where MAS has reason to believe the person is contravening the FAA, or where the person has been convicted of an offence under the FAA, or of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty in&nbsp;Singapore or elsewhere.&nbsp; Clause 20 expands the circumstances under which MAS may issue a Prohibition Order to instances where a person has been convicted of any offence in respect of&nbsp;financial advisory activities in a foreign country.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Clarifying aggrieved parties' right to appeal</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Next, right of appeal.&nbsp;The Bill also clarifies the right to appeal of aggrieved <p align=left>Column: 497</p>parties. The FAA currently provides for a right of appeal to the Minister if parties are aggrieved by MAS' administrative decisions, such as the rejection of an application for a licence or the revocation of a licence.&nbsp; There is ambiguity as to whether third parties may appeal to the Minister against these decisions.&nbsp; Clause 11 clarifies that only the applicant for the grant, renewal or variation of a licence, or a person whose licence is revoked or suspended, may appeal to the Minister.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Easing the restriction on granting unsecured credit</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Next, unsecured credit.&nbsp; Sir, the Bill also introduces amendments that mirror those in the Securities and Futures (Amendment No. 2) Bill that we have just passed. The current restriction on licensed financial advisers granting unsecured credit facilities to their directors, officers, employees or representatives for trading purposes will be removed under clause 14.&nbsp; As with the SFA, there are sufficient existing safeguards in the FAA on loans to directors, officers and employees to mitigate the risk of licensed financial advisers being excessively exposed to such credit risks.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Expanding the grounds for refusing grant or renewal of licence, or revoking a licence</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The grounds under which MAS may refuse an application for the grant or renewal of a licence, or revoke a licence, will be expanded under clauses 6 and 7 to include cases where the applicant or licensee furnishes false or misleading information to the MAS.&nbsp; Such acts call into question the integrity of the person concerned.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Conclusion</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the Bill introduces changes which will enhance MAS' quality <p align=left>Column: 498</p>of supervision and will, over time, help to raise the level of professionalism&nbsp;in the financial advisory industry.&nbsp; The updated legislation will encourage market competition, while moving up the quality bar. It will support the evolution of better quality advice and higher service standards&nbsp;by financial advisers, and strengthen consumer confidence in the industry.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, the Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation, or CISCO, was formed in 1972 as a statutory board under the Ministry of Home Affairs to provide,&nbsp; on a commercial basis, guards and security services to the private and public sectors.&nbsp; In this way, regular police officers could be freed up, to focus on core duties relating to the preservation of public peace and order.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 499</p><p><I>Developments in the armed security industry</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since CISCO's formation in 1972, the armed security industry in Singapore has changed in many ways.&nbsp; CISCO has evolved, diversifying from its origins as an armed security provider to become a \"one-stop shop\" for a full range of physical, IT and data security services.&nbsp; Some of the other Auxiliary Police Forces (or APFs) have also developed to become more sophisticated and reliable security providers.&nbsp; These changes in the industry, coupled with the demand for armed security services arising from the current security climate, prompted the Ministry to introduce competition into the armed security sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new framework for the armed security industry was put in place with the introduction of the Police Force Act 2004 in October last year.&nbsp; As Members would be aware, a key aspect of this new framework is the provision to allow Auxiliary Police Forces in Singapore to now compete for armed security services islandwide, as long as they meet the necessary requirements set out by the Singapore Police Force.&nbsp; Through regulated and open competition, the standards and performance of the Auxiliary Police Forces in Singapore would be raised, so that they could better support the Singapore Police Force in the provision of armed security service to buildings and premises to raise the overall security of Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reasons for corporatising CISCO</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these changes, it is no longer tenable for CISCO to remain a statutory board under the Ministry of Home Affairs competing with other commercial Auxiliary Police Forces.&nbsp; In June last year, I informed this House that, with the <p align=left>Column: 500</p>introduction of competition into the armed security industry in Singapore, the Government would be corporatising CISCO.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with its corporatisation, CISCO will be freed from various obligations and restrictions placed upon it as a statutory board under the Ministry.&nbsp; It need not follow the various directives that are meant for Government departments and statutory boards, which might have hampered its ability to provide competitive services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the other Auxiliary Police Forces can also be assured that CISCO will not enjoy any preferential treatment.&nbsp; For example, CISCO will no longer share the same insignia as Police and, upon corporatisation, CISCO's Auxiliary Police Forces will no longer don the same uniform as the Police.&nbsp; Our intention is to create a level playing field for all players in this armed security industry.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><I>Updates on corporatisation of CISCO</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now give a brief update on the latest developments on the corporatisation of CISCO.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MHA has decided to transfer all of CISCO's assets, liabilities, staff and contracts to the new company.&nbsp; This will ensure that the new company has the necessary staff and equipment to continue providing its services, so that disruptions to the existing security operations&nbsp;will be minimal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new company will operate as a wholly Government-owned company and will take over and continue to operate in all the business areas that the CISCO Statutory Board is engaging in today.&nbsp; Going forward, the new company can choose to enter new areas or exit existing&nbsp;areas of businesses based on market forces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 501</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MHA will not be giving CISCO&nbsp;a moratorium.&nbsp; This is in the best interests of CISCO, the other Auxiliary Police Forces (APFs) and the armed security industry in general.&nbsp; Today, CISCO is already operating some services commercially.&nbsp; A moratorium is thus not required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry and CISCO will work with all the relevant parties to ensure a smooth corporatisation.&nbsp; The date of transfer and dissolution of CISCO will be announced when the groundwork has been completed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, I would like to recognise CISCO's contributions to Singapore as a statutory board over the years.&nbsp; CISCO has played a key role in maintaining safety and security in Singapore all these years, and has been an important member of the Home Team.&nbsp; CISCO has provided security for many of our key installations.&nbsp; Most recently, during the SARS episode, CISCO responded very quickly to our needs, such as when we needed officers to assist in giving out SARS Home Quarantine Orders and in monitoring the compliance of those served with the Home Quarantine Orders.&nbsp; I believe that even after it is corporatised, CISCO, together with the other APFs, will continue to play their role in ensuring the safety and security of Singapore, responding as key partners of the Home Team, when they are called upon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the corporatisation of CISCO is a key step in the liberalisation of the armed security industry in Singapore which, in turn, is a necessary response to the prevailing security challenges.&nbsp; The corporatisation of CISCO will allow the Auxiliary Police Forces in Singapore to compete on a level playing field.&nbsp; I am confident that the standards of the APFs in Singapore will improve with competition.&nbsp; This would lead to enhanced physical security and protection of our critical infrastructure and key installations,<p align=left>Column: 502</p> and help to free up the Singapore Police Force to focus on its core duties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yet, it is also well known internationally as a garden city.&nbsp; The clean and green living environment has not come about by chance.&nbsp; It is the result of our deliberate efforts and commitment in planting trees and conserving nature over many years.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, with an expanding economy and growing population, we will have more people in our estates, more cars on our roads, and more buildings on our small island of Singapore. &nbsp;Our efforts in keeping Singapore green will only get more challenging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of this Bill will strengthen our efforts with these improved provisions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, besides protecting mature trees in Tree Conservation Areas, we will also be able to conserve mature greenery&nbsp;by designating selected roads as Heritage Roads;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will be able to impose heavier penalties for offences committed in our National Parks, Nature Reserves, and Trees Conservation Areas; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the effectiveness of NParks will be enhanced by formalising its regulatory functions and streamlining two existing Acts relating to greenery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now elaborate on the key features of&nbsp; the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Conserving mature greenery along Heritage Roads</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to conserve mature greenery along Heritage Roads.&nbsp; Sir, roadside greenery is an important feature of our Garden City. &nbsp;Greenery by the roadside,&nbsp;nurtured over many years, softens the hard effect of large physical structures and buildings to create a garden-like ambience in our city.&nbsp; This is especially so <p align=left>Column: 504</p>for roads lined with tall \"green walls\" of mature trees and multi-layered vegetation.&nbsp; One&nbsp;example is South Buona Vista Road.&nbsp; Other examples would include Mount Pleasant Road, Mandai Road, Lim Chu Kang Road and Arcadia Road.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lands along these roads are developed, even though the trees and greenery at the green verges of these roads are protected under existing provisions of the Parks and Trees Act, the mature greenery behind these green verges is not.&nbsp; The Bill therefore seeks to enable the Minister to designate, by <I>Gazette</I>, such roads as Heritage Roads, to conserve green buffers of up to 10-metre depth along both sides of these roads.&nbsp; The Bill will empower NParks to access and maintain these green buffers, and regulate works and activities to protect them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green buffer requirement will only be applied to state lands, but not to existing private lands along the Heritage Roads. &nbsp;However, when existing state lands along these Heritage Roads are subsequently sold under the Government's Land Sales Programme, the green buffer requirement will continue to be applied despite the change to private land ownership.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Heavier penalties</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to increase the penalty for cutting any tree with a circumference&nbsp;exceeding one metre within a designated Tree Conservation Area or a vacant land without permission, from the current $10,000 to $50,000.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this offence is usually committed by developers and contractors in the course of construction works.&nbsp; The current $10,000 maximum fine has not been revised since 1994, and is no longer as effective as before.&nbsp; Would-be offenders might choose to pay the fines than incur additional costs to conserve the trees.&nbsp; The Bill therefore proposes to <p align=left>Column: 505</p>increase the maximum fine to $50,000 to deter future offences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum fines for offences committed in the National Parks and Nature Reserves will also be revised upwards&nbsp;from $10,000 to $50,000 to reflect the comparative seriousness of these offences.&nbsp; The Bill will also introduce provisions to enable NParks to recover the value of any destroyed or damaged tree or plant from the offender.&nbsp; In assessing the value of a destroyed or damaged tree, factors, such as the species, size, age, location and condition of the tree and its replacement cost, are considered.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Formalisation of NParks' regulatory functions and streamlining of existing Acts</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not least, this Bill serves to formalise the regulatory functions currently performed by NParks.&nbsp; It will also serve to streamline two existing pieces of legislation that govern the protection, provision and maintenance of greenery in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Parks Act of 1996 covers the National Parks Board's corporate functions and its regulatory powers for the Nature Reserves, public parks, and the two National Parks, ie,&nbsp;the Singapore Botanic Gardens and Fort Canning Park.&nbsp; Whereas the Parks and Trees Act of 1975 covers NParks' management functions and regulatory powers for public parks, roadside greenery and the gazetted Tree Conservation Areas.&nbsp; There are overlaps in the provisions of the two Acts.&nbsp; We therefore propose to streamline them.</p><p><br><I>Streamlining the two Acts</I><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Parks Act, to be re-named the National Parks Board Act, will continue to provide for NParks' corporate and statutory functions in managing the <p align=left>Column: 506</p>National Parks, the Nature Reserves, public parks and greenery.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Parks and Trees Act will be repealed and replaced by a new Parks and Trees Act after the passage of this Bill.&nbsp; This new legislation will cover greenery conservation and regulatory powers related to the Nature Reserves, National Parks and public parks.&nbsp; Existing provisions for Tree Conservation Areas will be retained.&nbsp; Some provisions now in the National Parks Act, including those enabling the Minister to designate areas as National Parks and Nature Reserves, will be transferred to this new Parks and Trees Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage of this Bill will also give NParks the necessary statutory powers to carry out its greenery regulatory functions directly, instead of relying on the approval processes of other institutions and authorities, including URA's development control and BCA's building control processes.&nbsp; The Bill therefore seeks to require Qualified Persons,&nbsp;ie,&nbsp;architects and engineers who are responsible for development projects, to formally submit development and building plans to NParks as well for approval of the greenery provision.&nbsp; This should not result in additional work for the developers, as they will submit these plans electronically as usual to the various regulatory authorities through CORENET.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Implementation of the Bill&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in preparing this Bill, NParks has consulted the various industry stakeholders, including the Singapore Institute of Architects, the Institute of Engineers Singapore, and Real Estate Developers Association of Singapore.&nbsp;

The idea of encouraging local communities to participate in the management of the gardens in order to foster a greater sense of belonging and care for the natural environment is also laudable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When all these plans are realised, it will be an outstanding achievement for us, the scale of which has rarely been attempted elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, when PM Lee said that Singapore could distinguish itself on the world arena and become a city with the \"X\" factor -&nbsp;something you cannot quite explain but you know it when you arrive at the city - I instinctively felt that our Garden City concept is one such element that could help define our uniqueness and add to the \"X\" factor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 508</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time I come back from&nbsp;an overseas trip, I become more appreciative of all the landscaping,&nbsp; trees and shrubs&nbsp;lining the sides of our orderly&nbsp; roads, the green verges and public open spaces that intersperse our cityscape.&nbsp; Some people may feel that all this is too \"planned\", too \"sterile\" but compared to the urban chaos we find elsewhere, they help to soften urban landscape and provide a shield from the searing tropical heat.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the greening of Singapore started in earnest in 1971 with the launch of the \"Clean and Green\" week and since then, more than 300,000 trees and shrubs have been planted island-wide.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now time to move on to the next phase of the greening of the environment and that is more conscientious effort in the&nbsp; nurturing and conservation of our natural environment.&nbsp; The new Parks and Trees Act should give&nbsp; the greening of Singapore an even higher level of prominence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several features of the proposed new Act which I would like to highlight together with the key concerns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly,&nbsp;legislating greenery functions and the requirement for separate approval&nbsp;of greenery provisions.&nbsp; The new Act legislates the greenery functions currently performed by the National Parks Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;It now clearly defines and specifies nature parks, nature reserves, heritage road green buffers, tree conservation areas and others and what are prohibited in these areas.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the new Act, developers are now required to separately seek approval from the National Parks Board for their greenery provisions.&nbsp; Previously, this was dealt with through URA's development control and BCA's building plan processes.&nbsp;This is a signal of the elevated importance the Government is now placing on the natural environment and its value to our overall urban development.&nbsp; The Act also calls to attention&nbsp;the need to<p align=left>Column: 509</p> preserve and protect the natural environment&nbsp; and its biodiversity&nbsp; for the benefit and enjoyment of the present and future generations of Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is acknowledged that the requirement for separate approval&nbsp; is consistent with the practices of other technical agencies like BCA, URA and LTA and highlights the importance of NParks' functions, there is concern that this would further lengthen the time developers require to obtain planning approvals.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to urge NParks to commit to processing&nbsp; the applications within a reasonable period of time,&nbsp; as timing is often a crucial factor in determining the commercial viability and&nbsp;hence, the&nbsp;success of a&nbsp;development.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, avenues for appeals and consultation.&nbsp; The proposed Act allows the Minister to gazette any area for tree conservation or heritage road green buffers, nature&nbsp;parks and so on,&nbsp;based on the National Parks Board's&nbsp; advice.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is concern that in some instances, such a move may actually result in limiting the development potential of the affected or adjacent privately-owned land, and indirectly, negatively affect property values.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I propose that before the Minister gazettes an area for conservation, the views of the stakeholders and the public should be sought, as is commonly the case when URA draws up plans for an area.&nbsp; This will also help increase awareness of such conserved areas as well as cultivate a sense of&nbsp; community ownership and responsibility for the areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Ministry should also be open to proposals from the public on areas to be conserved as nature reserves, nature parks and the like.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, heavier penalties&nbsp;imposed for violation and&nbsp;the responsibilities of Government agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill stipulates relatively harsh penalties with fines of up <p align=left>Column: 510</p>to $50,000 and up to six months' imprisonment for those who violate the provisions of the Act, such as chopping&nbsp;down a tree in a conservation area or erecting signs on nature reserves&nbsp;without getting prior approval.&nbsp; The fine of up to $50,000 is five times the current $10,000&nbsp;penalty.&nbsp; The current Act also has&nbsp;no provision for a jail term of up to six&nbsp;months.&nbsp; This clearly indicates the Government's view of the seriousness of such violations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst this is a strong signal to the public of the public's responsibility for and the importance of nature conservation and caring for our environment, I hope that the Ministry would also ensure that it applies an even hand towards&nbsp;Government agencies&nbsp;whose actions may also adversely affect the environment we live in.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good example would be LTA when they plan for infrastructural developments such as roads and MRT tracks.&nbsp; There must be conscientious effort put in to minimise damage to the environment as far as possible, especially in areas which are considered of value to preserve.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They should also likewise be required to consult the National Parks Board and seek its approval on their plans for additions or upgrading of the transport infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp; More inter-agency communication and cooperation should take place to ensure that all aspects of the natural environment are taken care of in any proposal, whether this emerges from the&nbsp;private or the public sectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the community and private sector,&nbsp;Government agencies must also be sensitive to the need to protect our natural assets as far as possible in land use design and infrastructural development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, public education and community involvement.&nbsp; We need to promote respect for our environment <p align=left>Column: 511</p>among Singaporeans&nbsp;for the benefit of ourselves and our future generations.&nbsp; At the same time, we also need to provide avenues for Singaporeans to enjoy the natural environment and&nbsp; the parks and nature reserves that we have conserved.&nbsp; Otherwise, the average Singaporean will not be able to thoroughly appreciate the rationale for conserving such areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent reports on the large number of visitors to places like Chek Jawa and the Treetop Walk at MacRitchie,&nbsp; and just over the weekend, to the farms at Lim Chu Kang, which unfortunately led to traffic congestion, indicate Singaporeans' increasing attraction and sympathy for nature.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature lovers and conservationists are understandably wary that allowing the public too much access to nature reserves could damage the biodiversity of the area and mar the tranquility.&nbsp; While this could be the case, I think a balance has to be struck.&nbsp; The masses will not appreciate and treat their environment with respect if they&nbsp; have no opportunity to experience what these areas can offer in terms of their&nbsp;richness, beauty and even the psychic benefits of being able to get away from the hustle and bustle of city living.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, there are already so few recreational places on our tiny island that Singaporeans can go to.&nbsp; Opening&nbsp;up these areas into places families and perhaps, equally important, couples can visit, will go a long way towards making Singapore a great place for families and also, in some small ways, indirectly help boost our marriage rates.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must, nonetheless, step up efforts to educate Singaporeans to treat the natural environment, which is an increasingly scarce asset, especially in Singapore, with respect.&nbsp; In this regard, I think one of the most&nbsp; fundamental problems that ought to be tackled at the <p align=left>Column: 512</p>community level is littering of our beaches and parks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was reported, for instance, that in a recent beach clean up by 2,000 volunteers under International Coastal Cleanup Singapore,&nbsp;nine tonnes of rubbish or 90,000 pieces were retrieved in one and a half hours.&nbsp; According to the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (RMBR) and the Nature Society which organised this clean-up on an annual basis,&nbsp;the situation has been deteriorating as the amount of litter picked up has been rising over the years,&nbsp; from about 66,000 pieces in 2002 to 90,000 pieces this year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the NEA attributes some of these litter to flotsam that originated from neighbouring seas that are washed ashore, the volunteers found more of the litter on the beaches and very little in the mangroves which are less accessible.&nbsp; East Coast Park, a popular haunt, for instance, was one of the dirtiest.&nbsp; Even though many litter bins are provided, a substantial amount of trash is not ending up in the litter bins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I propose that NParks, together with NEA, jointly organise an&nbsp;intensive&nbsp;public education programme for the schools and community on the parks and nature reserves that the public can visit, what these can offer, why we need to&nbsp;conserve our environment and&nbsp;what they can and cannot do&nbsp;in the parks.&nbsp; The CDCs, I am sure, would be pleased to host such programmes.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will then be more Singaporeans who will value these areas and support the move to protect and preserve them.&nbsp; It will also be an excellent opportunity for inter-Government agency cooperation.&nbsp; There is no necessity for NEA and NParks to hold two separate campaigns or education programmes&nbsp;since the objectives are closely aligned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is noted that&nbsp;there are already volunteer groups like the VIPS (Volunteers <p align=left>Column: 513</p>In Park Service) who act as volunteer nature guides during the weekends conducting tours at trails in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve or the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.&nbsp; Besides these groups, we could also initiate the formation of volunteer park rangers to help patrol and look after the parks and&nbsp; encourage the community to take ownership of the protection of the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; This could be done jointly with NGOs like the Nature Society.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, the proposed new Act is a big leap forward&nbsp; from the present Act as it more sharply recognises the importance of caring for the environment.&nbsp; There is, however, more that can be done in terms of ensuring that the various Government agencies are also sensitive to the need to preserve our greenery in their actions as well as public education to increase the public's awareness and promote responsible use of these areas.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I was&nbsp;particularly moved last week in the House by the number of MPs, both old and young, who spoke out for that sector of Singaporeans who do not or cannot speak for themselves - the elderly, the disabled and the less educated.&nbsp; Today, I should also like to speak for another sector of the population of Singapore who are unable to speak for themselves, although Dr Amy Khor has, to a large extent, already spoken for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first, I would like to correct a grave misconception which&nbsp;I have heard repeatedly in the past, both in the House and out, and this is the statement that Singapore has no or few natural resources.&nbsp; I beg to differ.&nbsp; In fact, I&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 514</p>should like to state that I believe that Singapore&nbsp;is rich in natural resources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, our geographical capital.&nbsp; Our strategic location, our&nbsp;clement natural environment, without extremes&nbsp;in climate, our freedom from natural disasters and&nbsp;our deep seawater port, to me, these are all bounties of nature and if geography is destiny,&nbsp;I believe that ours is a very fortunate one.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our second natural resource is, of course, our&nbsp;human capital, which has been mentioned many times in the past and now given the recognition that it deserves.&nbsp; Wise Government has value-added to it and is continuing to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would not&nbsp;dwell on this aspect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third is our natural capital which, to me, is&nbsp;the most&nbsp;overlooked, unacknowledged and under-valued of all our natural resources.&nbsp; I am referring, of course, to our biodiversity,&nbsp;both our terrestrial and marine biodiversity, which is amongst the richest in the world.&nbsp; Not only do we fail&nbsp;to value-add, but we have been value-subtracting from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give a few examples.&nbsp; We have more species of trees and plants in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve than on the whole of&nbsp;the North American continent. This example has been cited many times.&nbsp; I do not think there is any harm saying it again.&nbsp; This is, of course, due to the fact that tropical rainforests are the richest&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>terrestrial biodiversity in the world.&nbsp; But only less than 3% of our forests remain today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our coral reefs, the marine equivalent of tropical rainforests, have a far greater biodiversity of marine lives than, for example, the Great Barrier Reef.&nbsp; The Great Barrier Reef is large, but is not as diverse as our seas.&nbsp; Even in Singapore waters alone - I am not passing out figures, but pictures - certainly&nbsp;this is the&nbsp;case.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are photographs of our <p align=left>Column: 515</p>marine biodiversity that had been taken only in Singapore waters and only in the last few years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore waters alone, we have more than 8,000 species of marine plants and fishes, and more are being discovered all the time, many of them are likely to be new species.&nbsp; This is despite the fact that more than 60% of our coral reefs have already been destroyed.&nbsp; Our mangroves have more than 2,000 species of recorded plants and animals, but we only have 1% of our mangroves left.&nbsp; I think, in the recent tsunami disaster you heard one of the functions of mangroves, but mangroves are also the breeding grounds for all the seafood that we eat - fish, prawns, shellfish - and they also serve to prevent land erosion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may be asking what is the value of these figures that I have been giving and the pictures that I have been passing around.&nbsp; In the past, I would have said that it would be difficult to give a figure to it, not because our biodiversity is not valuable, but because it is difficult to quantify.&nbsp; But I have since learned that if one is&nbsp;talking to hard-headed policy makers,&nbsp;one has&nbsp;to try and give some hard facts and figures.&nbsp; So let me try.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first example I should like to cite is ecosystem services.&nbsp; This is a very widely quoted example which, I am sure, some of you have already heard.&nbsp; In 1997, an international team of economists and environmental scientists put a dollar amount on all the ecosystem services provided free of charge to humanity by the living natural environment.&nbsp; Drawing from multiple databases, they estimated that the contribution was $33 trillion or more a year.&nbsp; This amount is doubled the gross world product, which is&nbsp;the total sum of all the gross national products of all the different countries in that same year.&nbsp; Ecosystem services <p align=left>Column: 516</p>could be defined as the flow of material, energy and information from the biosphere, the natural world, that supports human existence and it includes all the things we take for granted - regulation of the atmosphere and climate, purification and retention of water, formation and enrichment of soil, etc.&nbsp; To put it in an even more cogent manner, if humanity were to try to replace&nbsp;these free services of the natural economy by substituting services with its own manufacture, the annual gross world product would have to be tripled.&nbsp; But, of course, this is purely hypothetical and abstract because it would not be&nbsp;economically and technologically&nbsp;possible to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example I should like to quote to demonstrate the economic and scientific value of our biodiversity is an example in bioprospecting.&nbsp; Bioprospecting is the exploration of biodiversity for useful resources, pharmaceuticals, new food sources, petroleum substitutes and so on.&nbsp; And it is now recognised&nbsp;as a rapidly growing industry.&nbsp; In fact, it is so rapidly growing that biopiracy is also on the rise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One often quoted bioprospecting venture was conducted by the National Cancer Institute of the United States.&nbsp; They discovered, on one of their forays, that a sample taken from a small tree in Sarawak had, and I quote, \"100% protection against the cytopathic effects of HIV1 infection, having essentially halted HIV1 replication.\"&nbsp; In other words, it could prevent the development of a full-blown AIDS infection once an individual has been tested HIV positive.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a larger sample was needed to isolate and identify the chemical.&nbsp; But, when the collectors went back to Sarawak, to where they got the original sample, which was,&nbsp;of course, a few years later, because it took time, they found that the trees had been cut down.&nbsp; So, a frantic worldwide search was <p align=left>Column: 517</p>instituted because clearly this is a potentially very valuable chemical.&nbsp; It led to a lot of false leads, but finally, the magic chemical was found, not in the same specie, but in a very closely related specie&nbsp;in the small area of primary forest that we have left in the Singapore Botanic Gardens.&nbsp; And this enabled the molecule to be identified and replicated and it is now undergoing further testing for clinical use.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So our nature areas, having long been neglected, have now come to be valued for their recreational, heritage and even educational functions.&nbsp; But I believe that their potential scientific and economic values are still not probably recognised.&nbsp; And clearly in almost all these cases, this is not because they do not have that intrinsic value but because we have not found&nbsp;the way to make use of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore sees itself as a city state, and through the vision of Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, a clean and green&nbsp;city, a garden city and, now, a city in the garden, as Minister Lim Swee Say mentioned.&nbsp; But, we still see ourselves as a city.&nbsp; Our laws were designed to protect our greenery within the limits of this image of ourselves.&nbsp; And whilst this vision was sufficient and forward-looking 30 years ago, this is no longer the case today.&nbsp; I urge the Government to think of Singapore not as a city, but as a country with a hinterland.&nbsp; Our seas,&nbsp;offshore islands,&nbsp;coral reefs and&nbsp;nature areas are not just space for our city to expand into.&nbsp; They are repository of our valuable biodiversity and should be treated as such.&nbsp; And our laws should protect them as our natural reserves in the same way as we protect our fiscal reserves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I applaud the improvements in the new Parks and Trees Bill that serve to protect our natural ecosystem.&nbsp; But, may I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there are certain areas where I feel we could do much <p align=left>Column: 518</p>better.&nbsp; The first is in the protection of our marine biodiversity.&nbsp; I quote from Chapter 17, Agenda 21 of the Rio Summit:&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The marine environment is an essential component of the global life support system.\"&nbsp; Further down it also said: \"Each coastal state should consider establishing or strengthening appropriate coordinating mechanisms for integrated management and sustainable development of coastal and marine areas and their resources.\"&nbsp; But despite the fact that Singapore is a signatory of the Convention on Biological Diversity, we do not yet have any marine nature&nbsp;reserve.&nbsp; Many local experts, both professionals and amateurs,&nbsp;from the scientific and environmental communities have repeatedly called for better legal protection of our seas and&nbsp;marine biodiversity.&nbsp; One example is the Blue Plan proposed by the&nbsp;Environmental Feedback&nbsp;Group of the Feedback&nbsp;Unit, and also in the Singapore Green Plan 1992 and recommendations/feedback on the revised Green Plan 2012.&nbsp; Because of the lack of legal protection of our marine biodiversity, the National Parks Board has limited powers in this area.&nbsp; This problem is compounded by the multi-agency approach.&nbsp; There is no central coordinating body.&nbsp; Let me give an example.&nbsp; Water quality and monitoring are under Maritime Port Authority.&nbsp; The pollution and oil-spill are under the Ministry of the Environment.&nbsp; Coral collecting is under Singapore Land Authority, which is under the Ministry of Law.&nbsp; Aquaculture is under AVA.&nbsp; Coastal&nbsp;development and land reclamation are under URA, and nature conservation is under NParks.&nbsp; But, as I have said, NParks could do only a limited amount because there is no gazetted marine nature reserve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me, at this point, cite a recent experience in Labrador Nature Reserve.&nbsp; This is in relation to the illegal collection of corals.&nbsp; As I mentioned, NParks rangers, because of their limited powers&nbsp;even in an area which is a nature&nbsp;reserve, in this case,&nbsp;in the marine part of the <p align=left>Column: 519</p>Park, could only accost those culprits when they come to land with their sacks of booty, corals that they have broken&nbsp;off from the reefs shelf and other marine organisms.&nbsp; Of course, it was too late then, as the damage had been done.&nbsp; As I mentioned, coral collecting is under Singapore Land Authority, but&nbsp;Singapore Land Authority does not police these areas.&nbsp; The Navy and Marine Police are clearly not interested.&nbsp; The situation has got so bad that&nbsp;nature lovers have, in fact, formed a volunteer group, as was suggested by Dr Amy Khor in her speech.&nbsp; We have already formed a volunteer group, but clearly the powers of the volunteer group could only go as far as trying to educate these people and to enlighten them, but we have no legal powers.&nbsp; I only have the courage to bring up this example because I think the new Bill does empower National Parks Board to at least protect these marine areas a little better than they did before.&nbsp; The new Bill has extended its protection to marine areas insofar as the interpretation of \"fish\" now includes \"shellfish\", \"premises\" include \"any place under water\", and in clause 7, it replaces \"land\" with \"areas\", which I presume could, therefore, include marine or inter-tidal areas.&nbsp; I applaud this extension of the Bill because this would certainly give marine areas like Chek Jawa more protection than it previously did.&nbsp; But, of course, the question arises: why not go further and gazette some marine nature&nbsp;reserves?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next area where I think the Bill could improve further&nbsp;has already been mentioned by Dr Amy Khor.&nbsp; It is better inter-agency coordination and consultation at the conceptual level.&nbsp; The intense pressure on competition of scarce land by multiple-Government agencies, the desire of each agency to focus on and achieve its narrow targets quickly and as economically as possible, the lack of mandatory environmental impact assess<p align=left>Column: 520</p>ments and the impossibility&nbsp;of identifying and mapping out all our biodiversity on our island quickly enough, all these converged in a tendency to sacrifice our natural ecosystem to short-term intra-agency objectives.&nbsp; Very often, we are unaware of what has been destroyed and, it is literally, a race between the discovery and extinction for our natural heritage.&nbsp; While, of course, I do not contest the need for roads, housing, reservoirs, etc,&nbsp;I believe a legal framework for inter-agency consultation and coordination at the&nbsp;planning stage of the development, together with joint decision making and more detailed inter-agency alignments, after the collection of all necessary information, would allow for a far more comprehensive, less-competitive and less wasteful use of scarce land.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Bill is certainly an improvement on the existing Act and I applaud the protection of designated heritage roads and heritage road buffers.&nbsp; I think that is a great step forward.&nbsp; The new Bill also does allow for some consultation between LTA and the National Parks Board pertaining to these roads&nbsp;but it does not actually mention how early&nbsp;this consultation should take place.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also no mention of mandatory environmental impact assessments.&nbsp; Since an EIA requires a thorough assessment of all possible impacts of the proposed project on the environment, including the impacts on the biodiversity and the social and cultural impacts, it would, if properly conducted, be the fairest and most informed way to make difficult decisions on land use where different agencies are involved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, an environmental impact assessment, if it had been done in the past, would have prevented the dissection of Bukit Timah Nature Reserve from the central catchment area by the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE).&nbsp; It is now recognised that the commonest cause of biodiversity <p align=left>Column: 521</p>loss after destruction is fragmentation.&nbsp; The smaller the nature area in the ecosystem, the more vulnerable it is.&nbsp; The Bukit Timah Nature Reserve is our only tract of primary rainforest on the island left, although more than 90% of our island was previously covered with rainforest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would have been within the technical and economic ability of LTA, during the construction of the BKE, to construct part of it underground, but this was not done.&nbsp; And to reconnect Bukit Timah Nature Reserve now to the central catchment area, to do a bypass operation, as it were, would be far more costly than if this had been built in the original plan.&nbsp; So this is an example of how an environmental impact assessment would not have impeded the construction of the BKE, but it would have given us a win-win situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that, in the past, speed and cost cutting were given priority.&nbsp; But, today, increasing scarcity of land and the escalating value of fast-disappearing&nbsp; natural ecosystems and biodiversity require a paradigm shift in our approach, and therefore in our laws.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insufficient consultation at the conceptual stage of planning will result in the pursuit of short-term narrow objectives to the detriment of long-term sustainability, and everyone will be the loser, not just our biodiversity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third issue I would like to suggest to the Minister&nbsp;- here again, it has already been brought up by Dr Amy Khor although we were not in consultation&nbsp;-&nbsp;is the provision for more public consultation and participation in the Bill.&nbsp; Inter-agency consultation is essential but, in my view, not enough.&nbsp; The public too should be consulted, preferably at an early stage, even in the conceptual stage of any development that impacts on our nature areas.&nbsp; The underlying principle, again,<p align=left>Column: 522</p> being that we should gather as much information as possible beforehand in order to enable Government to make a fully informed choice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early public consultation can have many benefits.&nbsp; First, experts and interested amateurs can contribute valuable information not previously known to policy makers.&nbsp; Of course, Chek Jawa is one example.&nbsp; I believe that there have been some other areas amongst our Southern Islands which have recently been discovered, which have as rich a biodiversity as Chek Jawa.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, public feedback and consultation, not just from experts but from general members of the public, can also influence policy making constructively by giving a better insight into what the public wants.&nbsp; Our Government agencies and policy makers may not be as close to the pulse of public opinion as they imagine.&nbsp; For example, not everyone would want to travel from point A to point B on a road as quickly as possible all the time.&nbsp; LTA may find that shaving a few minutes off travelling time may not be as important as a pleasant drive along a heritage road.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minister Lim Swee Say, I believe, in a previous speech in the House, spoke about introducing mirrors in lifts to make the journey more pleasant and a more economical alternative to replacing slow lifts with faster lifts.&nbsp; May I suggest that retaining trees on roads would have the same function.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say that if LTA were to only focus on faster travelling time, we will have more and more roads and less and less worthwhile destinations to go to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third advantage that public consultation could have on our nature areas, as Dr Amy Khor has also said, is that it would educate and raise public awareness.&nbsp; It would educate and raise public awareness not just on the value of <p align=left>Column: 523</p>nature areas but also some of the problems faced by Government in trying to juggle our scarce land.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of volunteerism, I have already mentioned the Blue Volunteers.&nbsp; In areas such as implementation, monitoring and patrolling of our biodiversity, I believe that public participation is not just useful, it will be invaluable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I hope that the new Parks and Trees Bill will be protective and proactive rather than reactive.&nbsp; It should promote public consultation and participation rather than be perceived as merely restrictive and punitive.&nbsp; It should serve to protect whole ecosystems, see the whole picture, rather than just individual plants, animals and&nbsp;organisms.&nbsp; It should value our biodiversity and ecosystems not just as recreational or even heritage and education, important though they are, it should value them as economic and scientific assets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Bill should serve to protect our country as one with valuable natural resources, not just as a garden city but as an island nation with rich marine and terrestrial biodiversity.&nbsp; Our larger vision of ourselves must encompass not only our economy and our people but our biodiversity and ecosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week, I have already mentioned the triple bottom-line. &nbsp;I believe that if we are to be sustainable in the long term as a nation, we must guard our natural reserves as assiduously as we guard our fiscal reserves.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Swee Say--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Swee Say:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Dr Geh Min and Dr Amy Khor for their contributions as well as their support for the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me respond to the points raised by Dr Geh Min.&nbsp; I agree with her that&nbsp;in terms of&nbsp;natural capital, Singapore<p align=left>Column: 524</p> is one of the richest in the world.&nbsp; I was told by NParks that in terms of the number of tree species in our Botanic Gardens, it&nbsp;is more than what you can find in the whole of Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not necessarily share the view of Dr Geh Min that,&nbsp;over the years, we have been subtracting value from this natural capital that we have.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was the Minister for the Environment, about two years ago, I attended the World Summit on Sustainable Development.&nbsp; Environmentalists, naturalists, socialists and economists&nbsp;were there at that particular gathering.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion was a very simple one&nbsp;- that if we were to keep the world moving forward, we would need to harmonise all three areas of economic development, social progress and environmental management.&nbsp; In other words, when we talk about value creation, value adding or value subtraction, we have to look at all the three types of values in a holistic way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to remind the House that in order to conserve and&nbsp;preserve the natural capital of Singapore, it costs us a lot of money every year.&nbsp; It costs us millions of dollars every year to keep Singapore green.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to insist that every natural value&nbsp;- every tree, every grass, every plant - has to be left untouched, then we are not going to be able to pursue our economic value creation.&nbsp; If we are not able to create economic value, then where do we find the resources to preserve our natural value?&nbsp; In other words, I would not disagree with Dr Geh Min that, from time to time, we may have to subtract value from our natural capital in order to create economic value. But, at the same time,&nbsp;it is also important for us to recognise that we do invest some of our economic value to further create natural value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor mentioned&nbsp;the construction of SBG 2 at Marina South.&nbsp; The SBG 2 will cost us hundreds of <p align=left>Column: 525</p>millions of dollars, and I believe that&nbsp;it is a good example of how we are using our economic value to create value in natural capital.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Geh Min asked why do we not gazette marine nature reserves, why do we not make EIA compulsory and so on?&nbsp; Basically,&nbsp;the fundamental issue here is&nbsp;whether we recognise that the core issue facing Singapore, a small island with limited land resources,&nbsp;is the needs of&nbsp;land use requirement and the need to conserve&nbsp;nature reserves.&nbsp; The balancing between the two is the core issue.&nbsp; If we recognise that balancing natural reserves and land use requirement is indeed the core issue, I think we can manage the process, and indeed we have done so&nbsp;over the past many years, and I think we are doing a very good job.&nbsp; But if we do not recognise that we need to balance between the two&nbsp;- in other words, every time&nbsp;when we have to choose between conserving nature versus satisfying a new land use requirement, if we keep on saying that we have to conserve nature at the expense of meeting our land use requirement&nbsp;- then I would think that&nbsp;instituting public consultation and&nbsp;formalising EIA&nbsp;will only lead to more dialogues and&nbsp;more disagreements, but it will not lead to any harmonisation of both&nbsp;goals, and I do not see how this will make Singapore more sustainable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the whole, I do share Dr Geh Min's point that we need to do whatever we can to preserve the natural capital of Singapore and, better still, to create natural value as we move along.&nbsp; But&nbsp;at the same time, I want to remind the House that it is an ongoing challenge to balance between preserving&nbsp;natural capital versus meeting the needs of land use requirement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me move on to respond to some of the points made by Dr Amy Khor.&nbsp; She pointed out that a lot more needs to be done as we move forward, to make <p align=left>Column: 526</p>sure that Singapore will remain a garden city and, in fact, better still, become a city in a garden.&nbsp; I fully share her viewpoint on this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last month, in December, I went to Shanghai with my family on a vacation.&nbsp; My wife and children visited&nbsp;Pudong for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tour guide explained the development of Pudong to us.&nbsp; At&nbsp;Pudong, we saw many tall buildings.&nbsp; The tour guide was very proud, as they now have one of the most developed new cities in the Asia Pacific.&nbsp; As we walked the ground of Pudong, there was a big and beautiful garden.&nbsp; The tour guide said, \"Mr Lim, do you notice that Pudong has got many tall buildings and, at the same time, we plant a lot of trees and flowers?&nbsp; We did this because we learnt from Singapore.&nbsp; Singapore is a garden city.\"&nbsp; When he said that, I was very proud, I felt very good.&nbsp; And then came&nbsp;the punch line.&nbsp; He said, \"Mr Lim, I believe that Shanghai can do a better job than Singapore, because we are bigger than Singapore.&nbsp; We have more land, we have more space and, as a result, we can do a much better job in terms of making Shanghai not just a beautiful city but also a beautiful garden.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a very stark reminder that many countries and many cities are learning from our experience but yet, at the same time, in the spirit of healthy competition,&nbsp;they all aspire to do better.&nbsp; And if we stop progressing, if we stop to aspire to do better in Singapore, then the day will come when we have to go to other places and say, \"How I wish I can do a job as good as you.\"&nbsp; Therefore, I fully agree with Dr Amy Khor that sustaining Singapore as a garden city, going a further step to make Singapore a city in&nbsp;a garden,&nbsp;is a challenge that we all should&nbsp;share and embrace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor brought up a few points.&nbsp; I would like to respond to them quickly.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 527</p>Firstly, Dr Amy Khor hoped that the planning approval process should not be delayed as a result of the formalisation of NParks' regulatory function. &nbsp;Here, I want to assure Dr Amy Khor</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>that as far as the&nbsp;Qualified Persons are concerned, the process of filing for applications is still the same.&nbsp; They still go through&nbsp;CORENET.&nbsp; All they need to do now is to add one more item into the distribution list, and this is NParks.&nbsp; As far as the NParks' process is concerned, it is no different from before because NParks will continue to do what it is doing currently in processing the applications.&nbsp; In other words, we do not expect any undue delay, resulting from the formalisation of NParks' functions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Dr Amy Khor said that the legislation of&nbsp;Heritage Roads may have a negative effect on the land value and asked that the public&nbsp;be consulted.&nbsp; Sir, I want to assure Dr Amy Khor that the&nbsp;identification of roads to be gazetted as Heritage Roads will be done highly selectively for the simple reason that there are not many roads in Singapore that&nbsp;have that nice green wall, backed with a nice green buffer.&nbsp; In other words, we do not expect too many roads to qualify as Heritage Roads.&nbsp; And since we are going to do it selectively, we do not think that the impact on the land value will be significant.&nbsp; In fact, we believe that the gazetting of certain roads into&nbsp;Heritage Roads will, in fact, enhance the value in the surroundings, because I think everybody who lives in the city would like to live near a Heritage Road.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, Dr Amy Khor commented that the fines have gone up by five times and that the Bill&nbsp;introduces a six months' jail term.&nbsp; Sir, I just want to clarify that the six months' jail term, in fact, was already in the existing regulation.&nbsp; In other words, it is not a new addition.&nbsp; As for the <p align=left>Column: 528</p>increase in the fine from $10,000 to $50,000, as I mentioned earlier, most of these damages were caused by developers and construction companies in the course of construction works.&nbsp; As far as the members of the public are concerned, we do not expect them to wilfully go and damage many of our mature trees.&nbsp; In any case, for trees outside the Tree Conservation Area, we regulate that through the Parks and Trees Rules.&nbsp; Right now, the maximum fine is $5,000, and with the passage of this Bill, this will go up to $10,000.&nbsp; So, for members of the public, I want to&nbsp;remind them that even $10,000 is a hefty fine, so please&nbsp;help us&nbsp;take care of our nature and not damage&nbsp;these public trees at public places.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, Dr Amy Khor suggested that we step up inter-Ministry consultation.&nbsp; I believe that is the point made by Dr Geh Min as well.&nbsp; That I fully agree.&nbsp; In fact, Members of the House may be pleased to note that&nbsp;NParks has compiled a list of roads - what we call a watch list.&nbsp; Even though&nbsp;these roads will not&nbsp;be gazetted as Heritage Roads, we will still&nbsp;pay special attention to these roads.&nbsp;&nbsp;As and when there is any development that will affect these roads on the watch list, all the agents (LTA, URA, HDB, NParks and so on) will pay particular attention to make sure that all alternatives are being explored and that the impact on the environment will be fully assessed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, last but not least, Dr Amy Khor suggested we step up public education and&nbsp;we should do so with the community through partnership with the CDCs, the Town Councils, the Nature Society, and so on.&nbsp; I fully agree with that.&nbsp; Over the years,&nbsp;NParks&nbsp;has transformed Singapore into a Garden City.&nbsp; The next step that we intend to take is to transform Singapore into a Green Community, which means that we want to inculcate this appreciation for nature, and this love for<p align=left>Column: 529</p> planting trees&nbsp;in the community.&nbsp; For that to happen, NParks would be working very closely with the CDCs, the Town Councils, the CCs, the various grassroots organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, in time to come, the Green Community will take root in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I thank both Members for their support and&nbsp;by working along the line that they have suggested, we hope that Singapore will not only be green on the outside but, more importantly, every Singaporean will be green in the inside as well.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Would there be prior consultation before the Minister gazettes the area for conservation?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other question&nbsp;relates to the watch list.&nbsp; Would&nbsp;this actually be available to the public?&nbsp;

When we talk about Heritage Roads, we are talking about roads which have a green wall of trees&nbsp;supported by a green buffer of up to 10 metres. &nbsp;In the case of the Tree Conservation Area, basically only the trees on the green verges will be protected.&nbsp; In other words, when an area is being designated as a TCA, it has no impact on the landowner because the protection of the TCA applies to the green verges by the roadside in a public area; it does not cut into the areas owned by the private owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Heritage Roads, it will cover up to 10 metres of the <p align=left>Column: 530</p>green buffer.&nbsp; Should this green buffer cut into a private land currently owned by a private sector owner, again this buffer requirement will not be applied to the existing owner.&nbsp; However, what I have said earlier was that&nbsp;in time to come, should there be a transfer of ownership from the public sector to the private sector, then the green buffer requirement will apply to the new owner, because in the process of acquiring that piece of land, the new owner should know that the condition is already in place and in force.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to the watch list, at this moment, I would say that our first step is to identify a few roads to be gazetted publicly as Heritage Roads.&nbsp; As far as the watch list is concerned, we are still in the process of&nbsp; building up the list.&nbsp; Whether in time to come, we want to release the information,&nbsp;let us take it one step at a time, because for many of these roads, we have to consult various agencies to find out what are the development plans.&nbsp; But my point here is this.&nbsp; Once we have the watch list in place, what we can assure Members is that any development that will affect these roads will be given very careful consideration to make sure that all other alternatives are being explored.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Geh Min--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, the Telecommunications Act governs the regulation of the telecommunications sector in Singapore.&nbsp; It provides, amongst others, for the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) to grant licences, issue directions, codes of practice and standards of performance in connection with the operation of telecommunication systems, provision of telecommunication services, and the conduct of telecommunication licensees.&nbsp; The Telecommunications Act, together with these other instruments, allows the IDA to establish a robust regulatory framework to encourage and promote a vibrant and competitive telecoms sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Act was last reviewed in 1999, there have been changes and developments in the telecoms industry.&nbsp; The telecommunications market was fully liberalised in April 2000.&nbsp; Today, there are a large variety of operators offering a wide range of telecommunication services, albeit in varying degrees to the different market segments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendments, Sir, are a result of a comprehensive review of developments in the telecommunications sector, and practical experience from regulating the sector in the past five years.&nbsp; We have sought to ensure that the Telecommunications Act remains relevant to the industry today, and have taken into account best practices in benchmark jurisdictions like Hong Kong, Australia, the UK and the US.&nbsp; As part of the review, a public consultation was conducted on the proposed amendments to the Telecommunications Act in July last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now go through five main proposed amendments to the Telecommunications Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 533</p><p><I>Control, consolidation and acquisition of telecom licensees</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the control of telecommunication licensees.&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, telecommunication licensees are currently governed through licence conditions and provisions in the Telecom Competition Code.&nbsp; These conditions, some of which require the IDA to pre-approve every ownership change in licensees, were developed to address control of privately-owned licensees.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Clause 19 introduces a new Part VA to the Telecommunications Act to govern control of telecom licensees. The proposed amendments include a notification threshold&nbsp;at 5%, and approval thresholds at 12% and 30% where certain designated licensees are required to notify, or seek the IDA's approval for ownership changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In proposing these thresholds, MICA took into account precedents in other statutes. The notification threshold at 5% is based on the definition of&nbsp; \"substantial shareholders\" in the Companies Act. The 12% approval threshold is consistent with legislation, such as the Banking Act, and the 30% threshold is consistent with the 30% voting control level under the MAS Take-Over Code at which a person will be required to make a general offer for a public company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Part VA will also give the IDA powers to institute disenfranchise mechanisms if ownership changes of these designated licensees raise regulatory, competition or public interest concerns. The designated licensees will be required to seek the IDA's approval for the appointment of key management positions. The IDA will also be empowered to obtain information on shareholdings of the designated licensees. Clause 29 also introduces a new section <p align=left>Column: 534</p>69B which empowers the Minister to order remedial actions to be taken where a person acquires the assets, business or shares of a telecommunication licensee if the Authority has concerns as to whether that person is a fit, or proper person, or national interest concerns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these amendments streamline the regulatory requirements governing control and allow day-to-day trading to proceed unless the stated thresholds are reached. They will also prevent transactions that are likely to substantially lessen competition in the telecommunications market, or that are against national interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Sharing of telecommunication infrastructure for broadcasting services</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the sharing of telecommunication infrastructure. Sir, the Telecommunications Act currently allows the IDA to direct a telecommunication licensee to coordinate and cooperate with any other person in the use or sharing of telecommunication infrastructure. With the convergence of technology platforms, infrastructure originally intended for providing telecommunication services are increasingly being used for broadcasting services. There is a need to ensure that there are sufficient and clear regulatory powers to deal with the sharing of telecommunication infrastructure in these cases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 16 will thus amend section 27 of the Telecommunications Act to state explicitly that the IDA can also give directions to telecommunication licensees to share their infrastructure for the provision of broadcasting services. In addition, clause 32 introduces a related amendment to the Broadcasting Act to empower the Media Development Authority to direct a broadcasting licensee to coordinate and cooperate with a telecommunication licensee in the use of <p align=left>Column: 535</p>the latter's infrastructure where such cooperation is necessary for the provision of broadcasting services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Provision of space for telecommunication equipment</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third issue relates to the provision of space for telecommunication equipment. Most buildings in Singapore have space set aside for the purpose of installing equipment to provide telecommunication services to that building. However, there may be cases where insufficient space has been set aside within the building for this purpose. To facilitate network roll-out and ensure that telecommunication services can be provided to every building, there may be cases where space and facilities in certain buildings have to be used to service neighbouring buildings as well. For example, in some pre-war shophouses, there is no equipment room space to accommodate equipment for providing broadband services and it would be necessary to install the equipment in another building in order to provide broadband services to these shophouses. Clause 12 amends section 21 of the Telecommunications Act to allow IDA, where the matter has been referred to IDA, to give directions, where reasonable, to building owners and licensees for the installation of equipment in one building to provide telecommunication services to another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safeguards have been put in place to ensure that such directions can only be given, where reasonable, and only in relation to space that has already been set aside for telecommunication equipment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Penalty framework</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several amendments have also been proposed to strengthen the penalty framework in the Telecommunications Act for effective regulation and enforcement.<p align=left>Column: 536</p> Clause 6 introduces several new conditions under which the IDA can suspend or cancel a licence, including situations where a licensee has gone into liquidation, is no longer able to comply with its licence conditions, or in the public interest. These amendments have been proposed in light of IDA's experience over the years. For example, IDA has previously encountered cases during the economic downturn where licensees went into either forced or voluntary liquidation and were not able to continue their telecommunication operations and services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendments have also been proposed to increase the penalties for offences. Clause 6 increases the penalty for non-compliance with a written order to rectify a breach of licence condition, code of practice or standard of performance or direction, from a maximum fine of $10,000 to $100,000, in addition to a maximum jail term of 3 years. Clause 28 provides for an additional fine of up to $1,000 a day for every day that an offence continues after conviction. In addition, clause 27 increases the composition sum in the Telecommunications Act from $1,000 to $5,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Reconsideration and appeal process</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, the avenues of recourse against the IDA's decisions in the Telecommunications Act. Under various sections of the Telecommunications Act today, parties aggrieved by the IDA's decisions may appeal to the Minister as provided for in the Act. Clause 29 introduces an option for aggrieved parties to ask the IDA to reconsider its decision. I would like to stress that this is an additional avenue of recourse for aggrieved parties. They would still be able to appeal to the Minister as provided for in the Act, instead of asking for reconsideration from IDA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, clause 29 adds some provisions to detail the appeals process,<p align=left>Column: 537</p> such as the requirement for an appeal submission to state as concisely as possible the grounds of appeal, and the power for the Minister to request for information which may be relevant to the appeal. This will allow appeals to the Minister to be considered holistically and expeditiously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, let me say that these amendments, while fairly technical, are necessary to refine the Telecommunications Act to ensure that the legislative provisions are clear and sufficient, and remain relevant for the regulation of a fast-changing telecommunications sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, since the last review of the Telecommunications Act (TA) done in 1998 and 1999, there have been many structural and environmental changes faced by the telecommunications industry in Singapore and globally.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This review is very timely,&nbsp;as there has been no review since the telecommunications market was fully liberalised on 1st April 2000.&nbsp; Currently, we can clearly see that there are numerous operators or licensees offering a myriad of telecommunication services targeted at the different market segments and niches.&nbsp; The revision is necessary to identify and address the issues arising in an increasingly competitive multi-operator, multi-network marketplace.&nbsp; The revision has also been designed to align and incorporate the upcoming regulatory changes in the proposed Telecom Competition Code 2004, Telecom Consolidation Guidelines and the Competition Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 538</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to congratulate and thank the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, IDA and the other relevant stakeholders in the industry who have participated in the review to ensure that the Telecommunications Act is updated and, progressively, will continue to remain relevant while carefully considering the new market conditions and realities in a fast changing industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start, I would like to touch on some of the more consequential developments or amendments on the Bill.&nbsp; Firstly, power to grant spectrum right.&nbsp; This provision in the TA empowers the IDA with the express power to grant, vary, suspend or cancel spectrum rights.&nbsp; However, Sir, to remove any uncertainty and provide some comfort to licensees who have paid a substantial amount to secure spectrum rights and licence, it would be good that any change or variation would be expressly subject to reconsideration and appeal under section 69.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, suspension or cancellation of licence.&nbsp; This amendment will allow the IDA to suspend, reduce,&nbsp;restrict or cancel the licence granted based on a widened scope and category of cases and without any compensation.&nbsp; However, the authorities should take into consideration the heavy capital investment in both infrastructure and licence fees upfront payment.&nbsp; There should be some consideration for the cost recovery by the licensees.&nbsp; In this respect, may I propose that this section be amended to allow licensees to dispose or sell the licence to another party if all the conditions to own the licence are satisfied by the buyer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, removal or alteration of installation or plant for telecommunications.&nbsp; At the request of the property owner or developer, the public telecommunication licensee shall make reasonable alterations or relocations of telecommunication installation or plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the term <p align=left>Column: 539</p>\"reasonable\" here is ambiguous and can be potentially contentious.&nbsp; We should clarify what it means to be \"reasonable\" and provide real situation examples.&nbsp; There should also be some guidelines with regard to the terms and conditions that&nbsp;the licence can impose, especially with regard to the relocation cost or compensation.&nbsp; Once some clarity is provided, we can avoid stalemates between the property owner, developer and public telecommunication licensee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, provisions of space or facility or installation, plant or system by direction of Authority.&nbsp; To enhance street level and in-building service and coverage, developers may be directed to provide space and facilities in certain buildings to install telecommunication equipment when the authority considers it necessary.&nbsp; Again, here, it would be helpful if land owners can understand the conditions that may lead to such a situation.&nbsp; In addition to this, we should provide assurance that the authority involved is properly advised and technically competent to make such assessment.&nbsp; Can the claims be disputed?&nbsp; These are just a few questions that may arise from some of the quarters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever possible, the telecommunication licensee should install their equipment in the main distribution frame room so as not to tarnish the aesthetics of a building and deprive the developer or owner of valuable space.&nbsp; This would also provide a secure space for the equipment.&nbsp; This provision should also be applicable to other commercial and public spaces, for example, the MRT lines, expressway tunnels and underground shopping centres.&nbsp; In addition&nbsp;to the IDA's role in limiting the amount of space that may be used, IDA should also be empowered to set limits to rentals for equipment room space based on independent assessment <p align=left>Column: 540</p>of the&nbsp;market rental.&nbsp;This would ensure that transactions that take place between the property owners and the telecommunication licensees are at arms length and would not disadvantage either party.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly, codes of practice and standards of performance.&nbsp; This provision expands the scope of matters for which the IDA may issue a code of practice.&nbsp; As failure to comply to a mandatory provision in such a code of practice is an offence, the authority must ensure that the notification be made as accessible as possible.&nbsp; Any major change in the codes of practice and standards of performance should seek public comment and industry stakeholders' feedback.&nbsp; This would foster transparency in the changes or modifications made to the codes and encourage buy-in from the relevant parties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, any exemption granted to parties under section 26(5)</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

As there are revisions and new provisions being introduced, the Authority must help clarify the few ambiguities present in the amended Act.&nbsp; With greater empowerment of the IDA, it must move as a proponent of the industry and be transparent and flexible enough to allow for changes in the fast-paced and liberalised telecommunications industry.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify what is the intent of this clause because, as I read it, I wonder why is it necessary to prevent people from questioning the grant of a spectrum right, as what the clause said: \"No person shall question...\", and whether this clause means that the authority - in this case, I suppose it is the IDA - does not need to&nbsp;account for or to justify the grant of a spectrum right.&nbsp; That means they can do what they want without the need to be accountable, and \"no person shall question\" them, as this clause says.&nbsp; Can the Minister clarify?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Balaji Sadasivan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</B> I thank the hon. Members, Mr Zainudin Nordin and Mr Low Thia Khiang, for the points that they have <p align=left>Column: 542</p>raised with regard to the amendments of the Telecommunications Act.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first point raised by both Members was with regard to new section 5A, which is the power to grant spectrum rights.&nbsp; Mr Zainudin had expressed the view that any use of section 5 be subject to appeal under section 69, and Mr Low Thia Khiang had asked whether anyone can&nbsp;question the Minister.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, the powers for the IDA to grant, vary, suspend or cancel spectrum rights exist today in the Telecommunications (Radio Communications) Regulations.&nbsp; So, section 5A provides express powers in the Telecommunications Act for legislative neatness.&nbsp; It is not a new power that IDA is acquiring as a result of amendments to the Act.&nbsp; Frequency&nbsp;spectrum&nbsp;is a national asset and, therefore, IDA has a right to grant&nbsp;spectrum&nbsp;in a manner that protects national interests.&nbsp; However, that does not mean that a person cannot appeal against any decision that the IDA makes because, with regard to appeal, under section 69, telecommunication&nbsp;licensees may appeal against any of IDA's decisions, including IDA's decisions to change or vary their spectrum rights.&nbsp; Non-licensees, such as those applying for spectrum rights, may also appeal against IDA's decisions under section 5A.&nbsp; These appeal channels are provided for in section 69(1) and (2).&nbsp; So, section 5A should be read in conjunction with section 69.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin's second point was with regard to section 8, ie, the suspension or cancellation of licences.&nbsp; He proposed that this section be amended to allow licensees to dispose of or sell the licence to another party.&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, section 8 does not prevent a licensee from selling or transferring his licence, if it is allowed under the&nbsp;terms of the licence and subject to IDA's approval.&nbsp; The expanded scope for which IDA can suspend or cancel a licence is for<p align=left>Column: 543</p> situations where the licensee has gone into liquidation, is no longer in a position to comply with his licence, or it is in the public interest.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hon. Member's next point was with regard to section 17(2), which was the relocation of telecommunication equipment.&nbsp; He wanted clarification on what were considered reasonable alterations, and on guidelines for the terms and conditions that could be imposed in a dispute between a property owner and the telecommunication licensee.&nbsp; What is reasonable in a dispute must depend on the facts of each case.&nbsp; For example, there may be a case where the property owner or developer may desire the relocation of an installation simply because he feels that it is more aesthetically pleasing to him.&nbsp; In another case, the owner or developer may want to relocate the installation in order to be able to redevelop the land into usable housing space.&nbsp; It may probably be reasonable for the licensee to relocate the installation in the latter case, but not the former.&nbsp; As it is not possible to prescribe&nbsp;and cater for each and every possible circumstance in legislation, what would be considered reasonable in each case would be a matter best left&nbsp;to the court to decide upon, if the parties are unable to agree on their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for what would be considered reasonable terms and conditions, some form of guidance is already provided for in section 17(3).&nbsp; The effect of section 17(3) is that it would be reasonable, as a starting point, for the licensee to require that the property owner or developer bear the full cost of alteration or relocation of the installation or plant in the absence of factors dictating otherwise.&nbsp; Beyond that, the reasonableness of the terms and conditions imposed by the licensee would depend on the facts of each case.&nbsp; What <p align=left>Column: 544</p>is ultimately deemed to be reasonable in each case is again a matter best left to the court to decide upon, if the parties cannot agree on their own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hon. Member's next point concerns section 21(1), the provision of space or facility or installation, plant or system by direction of the Authority.&nbsp; There are three issues raised with regard to this section:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; When would it be considered necessary for telecommunication services to be provided to any building or land;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; The location where telecommunication equipment should be installed; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; The ability of the Authority to set rental limits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first issue, whether it is necessary for any given telecommunication service to be provided to any particular land or building would very much depend on the regulatory policies in force at that time.&nbsp; For example, it is currently a regulatory policy that basic voice services are available to all who request them.&nbsp; As such, if there is currently insufficient space set aside in a particular building for the installation of equipment to provide basic voice services, then the Authority may require that the owner of that building&nbsp;provides the necessary space.&nbsp; However, as regulatory policies would change from time to time in order to cater for the changing telecommunication environment, it is neither desirable nor feasible to legislate strict criteria for the assessment of necessity.&nbsp; Because of changes in technology, what is a necessity today may not be a necessity tomorrow.&nbsp; As a safeguard, however, any decision of the Authority as to the necessity of providing telecommunication services under the revised section 21 can be appealed to the Minister.&nbsp; This is already provided for in the revised section 69.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 545</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second issue, the location of installation of equipment, the Authority has issued a Code of Practice for Info-communication Facilities in buildings (COPIF).&nbsp; The COPIF dictates, among other things, the specifications of the space and facilities to be provided by building owners for the installation of telecommunication equipment within their buildings, as well as the use of such space and facilities.&nbsp; The Authority is currently reviewing the COPIF, and will shortly carry out a separate public consultation on its proposed revisions of the COPIF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third issue, the ability of the Authority to set rental limits, the revised section 21</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>already provides that the Authority can direct that the telecommunication licensee contributes to the cost and expense of the provision of the space or facilities in question as well as any other requirement that the Authority may specify.&nbsp; This would include the setting of rentals for the use of the space where appropriate. If the Authority&nbsp;sees fit&nbsp;to set such rentals,&nbsp;then it would, as a matter of course, take&nbsp;into account appropriate factors for determining the quantum of the rental, including the current market rental for similar space in similar buildings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hon. Member's next point was with regard to section 26, the codes of practice and standards of performance, and in particular, the granting of exemptions.&nbsp; He asked for transparency of the process.&nbsp; We agree with the Member on&nbsp;the need for transparency and consultation with the industry.&nbsp; IDA will consult members of the public and the industry on major changes to the codes of practice. As an example, IDA conducted two public consultations on the proposed amendments to the Telecom Competition Code last year.&nbsp; Exemptions may be granted for licensees or persons to be exempted from some provisions in the codes of practice.&nbsp; IDA will assess each<p align=left>Column: 546</p> exemption request to determine if the exemption can be granted in line with IDA's regulatory principles. Where exemptions have significant impact on&nbsp;the sector, IDA will generally consult on the proposed exemptions before reaching a final decision. For example, licensees classified as dominant may apply to be exempted from certain dominant licensee obligations imposed on them under the Telecom Competition Code.&nbsp; IDA will undertake a vigorous study and assess the exemption application as well as the state of competition in the market.&nbsp; IDA will base its decision on its assessment as well as comments received from the industry through public&nbsp;consultation.&nbsp; Codes of practice and exemptions will be published appropriately, such as on the IDA's website or in Government <I>Gazette</I>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members for the points raised. Sir, the amendments to the Act are fairly technical, but they are needed in order to keep the Act relevant to the fast changing telecommunications sector.&nbsp; It also keeps pace with the convergence of technology between the&nbsp;telecommunications and the broadcasting sectors.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, on a point of clarification.&nbsp; The Minister said that new section 5A(4) should be read together with the other sections.&nbsp;If the aggrieved parties who&nbsp;are affected by the grant of spectrum&nbsp;rights are allowed to appeal,&nbsp;why is there a need for this section to state that no person shall question whether the grant&nbsp;of spectrum right was, or was not, effected&nbsp;with the&nbsp;consent of or&nbsp;in accordance with the terms?

Claims can therefore be made against an LLP to the full extent of its assets. Also, if a partner is negligent, claims for losses resulting from his own negligence can be made against him and his personal assets. The LLP only protects \"innocent\" partners from personal liability for the negligence of other partners. The \"innocent\" partners' liability is limited only to the amount that they have contributed to the LLP.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill requires the name of an LLP to contain the words \"limited liability <p align=left>Column: 549</p>partnership\", or the acronym \"LLP\", so that the status is clear to those&nbsp;who transact with it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An LLP is not required to file its accounts or have them audited, nor does it need to disclose its capital. The Bill, however, has several safeguards to protect creditors' interest.&nbsp; An LLP is required to declare its solvency status annually, and to keep proper accounting records so as to enable true and fair views of financial statements to be prepared.&nbsp; The Registrar of LLPs is empowered to require the LLP to produce the accounting records for inspection where appropriate.&nbsp; In addition, all LLPs must have at least one locally resident manager whose responsibilities include ensuring that such requirements are satisfied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The LLP has features to ensure equity in the treatment of creditors in the event it is wound up.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill provides a structured winding up process, modelled after the Companies Act, where an independent party, namely the liquidator, will objectively collect all assets and distribute them fairly amongst the creditors.&nbsp; To prevent partners from siphoning off funds, the Bill provides that, if a partner receives a distribution from the LLP when the LLP is insolvent or which results in the LLP becoming insolvent, the LLP is allowed to \"claw back\" the amount distributed if the distribution occurred within a period of three years preceding the commencement of the winding up of the LLP.&nbsp; This safeguard is unique to LLPs. Other safeguards include the provision that partners can be held personally liable for the debts of the LLP if they carried on the business of the LLP with intent to defraud creditors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The LLP partners can be disqualified from being managers of an LLP and from being a company director. Also, a person who receives a disqualification order from the High Court under section 149 of the <p align=left>Column: 550</p>Companies Act will automatically be disqualified from managing another LLP or company during the period of the disqualification order.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall now briefly touch on some of the other provisions in the Bill.&nbsp; The Bill provides that the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, or ACRA, shall be responsible for the administration of the Bill.&nbsp; It also provides for the appointment and duties of the Registrar of Limited Liability Partnerships.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill requires that every LLP shall have at least two partners at the point of registration.&nbsp; The LLP and its partners must be registered at ACRA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate partnerships and private limited companies who may wish to convert to LLPs, the Bill sets out a conversion process which may be used by such partnerships or companies if they wish, whereby the properties, assets, interests, rights, privileges, liabilities, obligations and the undertaking of the partnership or company may be transferred to the LLP under the conditions set out in the Second and Third Schedules.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the creation of the LLP business vehicle will increase the options available to businessmen and investors. It is consistent with our overall policy&nbsp;in Singapore to make it a&nbsp;progressive and preferred place for business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.<br>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to start the debate on the LLP Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to first declare that I am a member of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA)&nbsp;Board which, as&nbsp;the Acting Minister has just announced,&nbsp;will be <p align=left>Column: 551</p>tasked as the regulatory board to administer LLPs upon enactment of the LLP Bill into&nbsp;law.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am heartened that the Company Legislative and Regulatory Framework Committee initiated&nbsp;the formation of a study team with a view of introducing LLPs as a new business structure to fill the gap between business firms such as sole proprietorship and partnerships, and private limited companies which are governed by the Companies Act.&nbsp; In addition to an alternative business structure, LLPs accord businessmen and investors with limited liability, privacy&nbsp;as their accounts are not required to be publicly filed, and tax transparency&nbsp;as the partnership would be a separate legal entity from its partners.&nbsp;The absence of filing&nbsp;requirements and mandated company secretariat, as in the case of private limited companies, also means lower compliance costs.&nbsp; What is also interesting is the provision for a seamless conversion from general partnerships or companies to LLPs or vice versa.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, broadening the business structure options to the business community would certainly encourage existing businesses to stay rooted while attracting new businesses, both local and foreign, to be created here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback I received from various sources has been favourable, with many keenly awaiting for the passage of this Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;While I applaud the Ministry of Finance's timely move in introducing this Bill, which will enable us to keep pace with countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, I would like to raise several concerns and issues for the collective benefit of the business community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Sir, is the provision of a grace period of up to two years for a sole remaining partner to find another partner,<p align=left>Column: 552</p> failing which winding up proceedings will commence.&nbsp; I feel this duration is excessive and may be subject to potential abuse.&nbsp; One partner may deliberately leave after a short time of incorporation to make way for the surviving partner to run the business behind the veil of limited liability for a much longer period than necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;While it could be argued that the Companies Act now allows the registration of private companies with one director and one shareholder who need not be a different person, it has to be borne in mind that a one-partner LLP is a legal misnomer which is not in line with international practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I would like to suggest the following approach for the Minister to consider: &nbsp;Should the vacancy in a two-partner LLP arise from the resignation of one partner, the surviving partner should be required to resolve the partner vacancy within one year.&nbsp; However, should the vacancy</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>result from death of one of the partners, then the grace period of up to two years, as provided for in the Bill, applies.&nbsp; This would help in preserving the credibility of LLPs and prevent those desirous of establishing LLPs from taking advantage of such loopholes.&nbsp; The aim is also to induce a sense of urgency in resolving the remaining partner's vacancy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move to my second point.&nbsp; Since LLPs are not required to prepare, file or have its financial statements audited, other than just&nbsp;declaration of solvency or insolvency to the Registrar of LLPs annually, I am concerned that this may place unwary creditors in a position of high risk.&nbsp; While it is understood that some of the key objectives of creating the LLP structure is to confer limited liability on owners of firms and also to lower compliance and maintenance costs for businesses, a fair balance needs to be struck between meeting these objectives and protecting creditors and customers of LLPs.&nbsp; I would like to suggest that a form of monitoring and surveillance system be developed by ACRA, the regulatory body<p align=left>Column: 553</p> in this case, to ensure that LLPs maintain an annual set of financial statements and records that properly reflect a true and fair state of affairs of the business and that these are readily accessible in the event of a dispute arising between the LLP and its creditors.&nbsp; A monitoring and surveillance system would help in ensuring that LLPs become more compliant in properly declaring their state of solvency or insolvency.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate a conversion to an LLP, this Bill provides that whenever a partnership converts to an LLP, all the properties and assets that are vested in the partnership would be deemed to vest in the LLP.&nbsp; In addition, all the liabilities and obligations of the partnership would be transferred to the LLP.&nbsp; I believe this is fair.&nbsp; However, the Bill is silent about allowing changes, such as adding new partners or relieving existing partners, and restructuring the assets during the conversion stage.&nbsp; If there is no provision for such changes at the conversion stage, I would like to propose that such flexibility be permitted to allow the entities to make the necessary adjustments at the stage of conversion to an LLP.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, on the point of the conversion process, the Bill is also silent on payment of stamp duty.&nbsp; I am of the view that a change of an existing partnership to a limited liability partnership should not attract stamp duty as it is merely a change in the legal status of the business structure.&nbsp; It would also be contradictory to the seamless conversion process envisaged in the Bill.&nbsp; However, if stamp duty is considered necessary, I feel that existing partnerships should be given a sufficient window period, say, 1-2 years for the settlement of stamp duty, considering that larger partnerships would likely take a longer period of time than smaller ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next point pertains to clause 9 of the Bill.&nbsp; According to this clause, an LLP<p align=left>Column: 554</p> is not bound by anything done by a partner in the circumstances provided for by the Bill.&nbsp; In this case, I believe an aggrieved party could not initiate legal proceedings against the LLP.&nbsp; Considering that the aggrieved party's course of action is only against the partner he had dealt with, what happens if the partner&nbsp;is a bankrupt?&nbsp; This is by virtue of clause 12 which provides that a bankrupt could still be a partner of an LLP, unlike a bankrupt who could not be a director of a private limited company.&nbsp; It is legally impossible and practically pointless to sue a bankrupt.&nbsp; Where is the protection for the aggrieved party in such situations?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In regard to the liability of an LLP partner, while a partner would not be personally liable for the malpractices of other partners in the LLP, the Bill is unclear whether a partner who is negligent and fraudulent is subject to unlimited personal liability according to the general principles of law, or whether his liability is limited to his capital contribution.&nbsp; I would appreciate it if the&nbsp;Minister could clarify this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, LLPs are likely to be embraced by many partnerships for the benefits they confer, especially that the move involves little cost.&nbsp; Many businessmen and entrepreneurs have also mentioned that the new business structure is more attractive for those who&nbsp;wish to limit their personal liability.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, foreign companies would welcome a wider variety of business structures and legal vehicles to choose from when they consider investing in our country.&nbsp; Providing this additional LLP option is another important step in our endeavour to make Singapore the best place for business.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the fact that we are progressively moving up the technological and innovation ladder, and also the intense dynamics of the global business <p align=left>Column: 555</p>environment that we operate in, where rules and laws are frequently reviewed and revised to suit changing business needs, it is imperative that we, too, must be prepared to do likewise in periodically reviewing our policies and regulations to keep ourselves relevant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to-date, the Singapore legal system recognises just two categories of business entities, namely, companies and partnerships.&nbsp; Partnership, the last innovation in business legislation under the common law, was introduced in 1907 when the Limited Partnerships Act was enacted in Britain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, for close to a century, a firm could choose between being a company or a partnership.&nbsp; A company is the preferred choice if one wants&nbsp;a good split between ownership and management.&nbsp; On the other hand, a partnership is the route if one wants greater flexibility in arranging the internal affairs of the business and does not mind unlimited liability.&nbsp; As the Minister has said, so far, only a company, either a private limited company or a public company, offers the directors or shareholders limited liability.&nbsp; Sir, for the past century, this has been the legal framework of businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as a result, the whole culture of how business is transacted has evolved around this legal framework.&nbsp; The public understands the pros and cons when they enter into a relationship with a business entity, be it a company or a partnership.&nbsp; Thus, when we create a new entity, the Limited Liability Partnership, we need to bear this in mind.&nbsp; We are not just introducing a new entity, we are actually introducing a&nbsp;whole new culture, and by this legislation, people would have to take on a new culture in doing business.&nbsp; Sir, when <p align=left>Column: 556</p>changing culture, this House should take great care because the instincts of people could not be changed overnight, while the law could be implemented overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let us look at the concept of LLP and how it came about.&nbsp; The concept of LLP was invented in Texas in 1991, not too long ago, just 13 years ago, as an alternative to an ordinary partnership, in which innocent partners were shielded from the vicarious personal liability for malpractice liabilities of the firm.&nbsp; Thus, an individual partner of the LLP would not be liable for claims against the firm arising from negligence or other forms of malpractice, unless the partner was personally involved in the negligence or malpractice.&nbsp; Sir, we must bear in mind that this concept was introduced at a time, and in a country, where litigation, as well as damages awarded by the courts, was increasing at an alarming rate.&nbsp; This concept in the US proved to be very popular and most states in&nbsp;the US&nbsp;have such legislation by the end of the decade, whereas UK only implemented its LLP Act in 2000.&nbsp; When the UK Labour Government introduced the Bill, being a pro-business Bill, some of the Labour MPs asserted that it was the outcome of the lobbying effort of the big accounting companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in Singapore, litigations involving malpractices of partnerships are rare,&nbsp;in fact, very uncommon.&nbsp; Thus, this could not be the reason for introducing this Bill in this House.&nbsp; It is true that when this legislation is implemented, it would help small partnerships to resolve the age-old problem of one or more partners retiring.&nbsp; It is also true that this legislation would provide a new platform to launch many more new businesses.&nbsp; But I believe the major beneficiary of the LLP Act would be the big accounting companies or other existing professional services partnerships.&nbsp; Therefore, in examining this Bill, I am particularly interested in the safe<p align=left>Column: 557</p>guards for the clients and suppliers of the existing partnerships which would take the opportunity to convert to LLPs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, therefore, this leads me to a key question.&nbsp; The question is:&nbsp; is LLP closer to a partnership or a company?&nbsp; The Minister has mentioned that it is more like a partnership, except it has limited liability.&nbsp; But if you look at it more carefully, while partners of LLP would be free to make arrangements amongst themselves much like a partnership, the LLP itself would be a separate legal entity owned by the partners.&nbsp; Thus, it would be able to enter into contracts, hold properties and continue to exist independently of changes in the membership.&nbsp; Thus, in many respects, LLP is more akin to companies than to partnerships.&nbsp; In fact, in some jurisdictions, the participating legal persons involved are referred to as \"members\" and not as \"partners\", to distinguish the differences unambiguously.&nbsp; Therefore, personally, in fact, I would prefer the drafter of the Bill to use the word \"members\" instead of \"partners\" in this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also like to deal with the fundamental roles and responsibilities between two parties in a business transaction.&nbsp; Under the common law system, limited liability granted&nbsp;is a privilege.&nbsp; It tilts the balance between two parties towards the one with limited liability.&nbsp; Also, with privilege come responsibilities and one of these responsibilities under the common law is the requirement to disclose the soundness of the finances so that the other party could make a sound judgment and decision.&nbsp; Thus, companies with limited liability are required to disclose their financial status.&nbsp; On the other hand, partnerships with unlimited liability have been free to keep the internal financial status to within the partners.&nbsp; Thus, in creating the new entity, it is important that the law be drafted so that, as the Minister has also mentioned, this privilege is not abused.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 558</p> We need to strike a proper balance between privilege and disclosure.&nbsp; In this Bill, clause 24 imposes a requirement for the LLP to lodge an annual declaration of solvency.&nbsp; So the question we should ask is whether this requirement is striking a proper balance.&nbsp; However, there is no definition&nbsp;in the Bill about what is considered solvency.&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone reading the Bill might say that being \"solvent\" is \"the ability to pay&nbsp;bills\", or for the annual declaration of solvency, maybe&nbsp;at the end of the year, one might&nbsp;have a positive balance in the&nbsp;assets.&nbsp; And a positive balance could be as little as $10 or $100.&nbsp; So I feel that&nbsp;solvency is not the same as the declaration of assets and also the liabilities of the LLPs.&nbsp; Since an LLP is more akin to a company, I personally would like to see the same disclosure requirement that was required of a company as provided for under the Companies Act.&nbsp; When UK implemented its LLP Act, this was what was required.&nbsp; In other words, disclosure of the LLP is more in line with that required of a company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another major consideration is the quality of service provided by the LLP.&nbsp; With unlimited liability,&nbsp;the perceived assurance was that the partners in a partnership would work out a very rigorous system of check and counter-checks to ensure quality of service provided.&nbsp; Indeed, it was a great privilege to the professional to be invited by the partnership to be a partner.&nbsp; Hence, the existing partners would screen the aspiring newcomers vigorously.&nbsp; For the prestigious partnerships, the tutelage could be long and the screening process exhaustive.&nbsp; Thus, the public, in dealing with a partnership, has this assurance of the quality of work performed by a partner, in fact, any partner within a partnership.&nbsp; In creating an LLP, this House should be assured that the quality of work would not be compromised, in particular, when existing partnerships are converted to LLP as provided in this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>A consequential question would be the question of damages.&nbsp; In a partnership, the aggrieved party could take any of the partners to&nbsp; court to seek damages suffered as a result of poor advice or malpractice.&nbsp; When an existing partnership is converted to an LLP, this sense of protection will go away.&nbsp; Would the Minister consider, for instance, making sure that the converted LLP&nbsp;charge less for the same service it provided before the conversion?&nbsp; Because the nature of the transaction has changed.&nbsp; Alternatively, would the Minister consider requiring the converted LLP to carry the relevant insurance so that&nbsp;third party's interest of the transaction could be protected?&nbsp; Because, once the conversion is over, the unlimited liability would also go away. In fact, in some jurisdictions, requiring the converted LLP to carry insurance is part of the total package.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as the Minister has pointed out, the LLP concept has been well tested in the US and the UK.&nbsp; The drafter of this Bill has done a very thorough job scanning the legislation of those countries that have enacted similar legislation.&nbsp; Hopefully, this Bill has taken into consideration the lessons learned elsewhere.&nbsp; Therefore, a question I would like to ask is&nbsp;whether this Bill is self-contained in its entirety and could function well as&nbsp;a single source of legislation for the LLP.&nbsp; Or do we need to amend other legislation, such as the Companies Act, and other related laws to make the LLP concept function appropriately?&nbsp; The Sixth Schedule of the Bill lists the consequential amendments to other laws in Singapore.&nbsp; But reading through it, I gained the impression that they are mostly amendments of a typographical nature to include the LLP concept.&nbsp; It seems to me that when the UK enacted the LLP Act, various regulations were introduced, including a requirement for financial disclosure equivalent to that required&nbsp;of<p align=left>Column: 560</p> companies, which I have mentioned earlier, the provision that partners of an LLP can be sued for wrongful&nbsp;or fraudulent trading, and the provision that partners can be disqualified from being partners of an LLP and&nbsp;company directors.&nbsp; The UK also amended the Insolvency Act of 1986 to include a measure that would deter partners of an LLP from siphoning off funds to the detriment of creditors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the other aspect is that up to now, our discussion and deliberation leading to this Bill have been mostly focused on professional partnerships. However, in the United States where LLPs have existed for some time, the LLP structure is increasingly used for joint ventures, such as those between manufacturing companies.&nbsp; In the US, there are many advantages, especially when non-US international companies come together to establish a new joint venture in the locale.&nbsp; The structure offers relatively favourable tax advantages, as compared to the traditional companies.&nbsp; Thus, the US experience shows that LLPs could be a new vehicle for entirely new enterprises, which the LLP drafters might not have anticipated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is a regional hub.&nbsp; Would the new LLP legislation create new niches for foreign professionals or even foreign LLPs in the legal and accounting professions to enter into the Singapore market?&nbsp; As a partner in an LLP could be an individual or body incorporate&nbsp; - &nbsp;foreign ones included as provided for under clause 7 of this Bill&nbsp; - &nbsp;this could throw the whole field of local professional services open to foreign competition.&nbsp; So, in proposing this Bill, I hope the Minister has taken into&nbsp;consideration the American experience.&nbsp; There should not be&nbsp;unexpected consequences flowing from the Bill if the LLP structure is applied beyond the professional partnerships.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, after the Act is enacted, customers and suppliers of the LLP must be made aware of the nature of the new <p align=left>Column: 561</p>entity they are dealing with. I urge the Ministry to conduct an exercise to educate the public regarding&nbsp;LLP.&nbsp; We should ensure that LLP should not be confused with any other abbreviation, such as the LLB, which is Bachelor of Laws, or the Taiwanese version of abbreviations.&nbsp; I would suggest that the Ministry make certain regulations to ensure that LLP be displayed prominently in all business letters, just like the requirement to display company registration number.&nbsp; Furthermore, until the public is conversant with the LLP abbreviation, maybe the full text of LLP, ie, Limited Liability Partnership, should be used in&nbsp;business letterheads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the creation of limited liability partnerships does add to the variety of business entities available to those wishing to set up business in Singapore.&nbsp; Firms will now have the option of becoming a limited liability entity with the internal flexibility of a partnership.&nbsp; Taking everything into consideration, such a new business environment would only be a positive&nbsp;step for Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Ivan Png Paak Liang (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Ivan Png Paak Liang (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. &nbsp;However, I would like to share a concern with the Minister and hope that it can be addressed.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that in the United States and in the UK, a key attraction of&nbsp;a limited liability partnership&nbsp;is its flexibility as a way of minimising taxes. This has already been mentioned by Dr Wang Kai Yuen.&nbsp;I would like to emphasise this point.&nbsp; &nbsp;In particular, partners may write off partnership losses against their personal income. Roughly speaking, this would also be true of our proposed LLP.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the Bill provides for transition from partnerships to LLPs and from companies to LLPs.&nbsp; If investors choose LLPs over partnerships, there will be no<p align=left>Column: 562</p> tax revenue loss because any opportunity they had as a partnership would&nbsp;be available with LLPs.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if investors choose LLPs over the limited company form, our tax revenue will be diminished. Shareholders of companies may not write off the company's losses against their personal income. But, as I have&nbsp;just said, LLP partners or members&nbsp;may write off partnership losses against their personal income. So, our Inland Revenue Authority is going to&nbsp;lose revenue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Dr Wang Kai Yuen has mentioned, the LLP form will probably not only attract professionals such as accountants and lawyers, but it is going to attract regular business like manufacturing, services, not just professional services.&nbsp; So the scope of this tax law is much wider than we might have thought initially.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, one of our competitive edges as an economic hub is the simplicity of our tax system. We offer a simple system with very low rates; made even simpler when recently we rescinded taxation of shareholder dividends.&nbsp; I do hope that we do not&nbsp;graduate to a \"first-world\" system of high tax rates with complicated deductions and reliefs that would benefit only a selected group of taxpayers.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what measures have been taken or are contemplated to void the LLP becoming a tax shelter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members for their support and the comments that they have made.&nbsp; I would like to thank Dr Wang Kai Yuen for an erudite&nbsp;exposition of the history of LLP and the various issues involved.&nbsp; And Dr Ahmad Magad who&nbsp;anticipated my speech on the Stamp Duties Act, because he has raised an issue which actually relates to the Stamp Duties Act, and I commend him for that.&nbsp; I will also address that here.&nbsp; And, of course, Prof. Ivan Png who actually brought up an issue which we discussed<p align=left>Column: 563</p> last November.&nbsp; So we have a spectrum of issues here.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad brought up the issue of whether two years is too long a grace period in the case&nbsp;where there is&nbsp;only one remaining LLP partner.&nbsp; Like what Dr Wang Kai Yuen has said, we had extensive public consultation on this. What is interesting is that the public feedback was:&nbsp; is it too short?&nbsp; Their consideration was that when&nbsp;we&nbsp;do&nbsp;international benchmarking,&nbsp;the US Delaware model is the most popular model,&nbsp;and there when&nbsp;they are down to one partner,&nbsp;they do not get deregistered.&nbsp;&nbsp;They remain an LLP.&nbsp; So it is a one-partner LLP; in other words, it is for an indefinite period.&nbsp; So we use that as one particular benchmark.&nbsp;&nbsp;The UK has it as six months.&nbsp; Some say that it is a bit too short.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, based on consultation, we decided that, as the Member has pointed out, it is really a misnomer to have an LLP&nbsp;with only one partner.&nbsp; The common understanding of a partnership is&nbsp;a voluntary association of two persons coming together to set up a business for profit.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we have a two-partner LLP.&nbsp; Once we settle on&nbsp;that and&nbsp;we have a two-partner LLP, what do we do then when we are down to one partner?&nbsp; So we need to give a grace period.&nbsp; The key thing is to ensure that there is sufficient time for the remaining partner to find someone else.&nbsp; We were told that one consideration is that sometimes it takes more than six months, when it comes to a partner who is deceased, for the Letters of Administration or Probate to be done.&nbsp; So, on balance, we said, let us give them two years to find a partner or wind up the LLP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad also brought up the point about the liability of partners and <p align=left>Column: 564</p>asked for clarification.&nbsp; On the liability of partners, when&nbsp;a partner is&nbsp;personally liable for a wrongful omission or act,&nbsp;he is&nbsp;not limited to the capital contribution.&nbsp; This means&nbsp;he is&nbsp;personally liable to the full extent of&nbsp;his net worth.&nbsp; So, if&nbsp;a partner is&nbsp;professionally negligent,&nbsp;he is&nbsp;personally liable.&nbsp; So it is not limited to&nbsp;his contribution.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The LLP itself will also be liable for&nbsp;the partner's&nbsp;act.&nbsp; It is only the innocent partner, like I mentioned in my speech, who will not be held liable.&nbsp; The fact that&nbsp;a person is a&nbsp;partner in&nbsp;an LLP does not make&nbsp;him personally liable for the actions of the other partner who has committed a wrongful omission or act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member&nbsp;asked why is there clause 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasoning behind clause 9 is that the LLP should not be bound if&nbsp;a partner has&nbsp;no authority to act in&nbsp;a particular matter.&nbsp; I think that is quite reasonable.&nbsp; We should not bind the LLP if&nbsp;a partner has&nbsp;no authority on that particular matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad also brought up the point about conversion, which I said he anticipated in my next speech&nbsp;on stamp duties, but I will take it here.&nbsp; He is quite right that when it comes to conversion, what we have done is that when&nbsp;a general partnership&nbsp;is converted into an LLP,&nbsp;with the same partners and the same business, we will provide a seamless conversion.&nbsp; So all the assets and liabilities will be vested in the LLP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of stamp duties, we have made a concession.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a conversion and the LLP has chargeable properties, the stamp duty would be waived.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad and Dr Wang brought up the issue of creditors' interest, that we should protect creditors, given the fact that we are now giving partnerships limited liability.&nbsp; This is a valid concern and we took that into<p align=left>Column: 565</p> account.&nbsp; Whenever&nbsp;we have a new business form,&nbsp;we have to strike a balance between the users of the business form&nbsp;- owners, investors&nbsp;- and those who are dealing with it -&nbsp;the creditors, suppliers, customers, clients.&nbsp; We have to balance it.&nbsp; And when we want to strike a balance,&nbsp;we reference it back to the objective of this new business form.&nbsp; As I have mentioned, the objective of this new business form is to have the flexibility of a partnership with the inter-position of limited liability.&nbsp; So we have to ensure this, when we are striking&nbsp;a balance.&nbsp; As Dr Wang has said, we did a thorough scan of all the different legislation&nbsp;on how best to balance this.&nbsp; We wanted to make sure that we do not increase the business&nbsp;compliance cost or introduce a lot of features of a company into this structure, which will then defeat the whole idea of having a partnership, and&nbsp;we had to balance it, as both Members correctly pointed out, so that there are sufficient safeguards to protect creditors.&nbsp; I have mentioned earlier some of the safeguards</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>that will be put into the Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Wang asked whether&nbsp;there is&nbsp;a definition of&nbsp;declaration of solvency&nbsp;in the Bill.&nbsp; There is, if you look at clause 24 of the Bill which defines what it means by that - that you should be able to pay your debts over the normal course of your business.&nbsp; So it gives a sense of what &nbsp;it means.&nbsp; To give a sense of perspective on this too, is the declaration of solvency enough?&nbsp;&nbsp;He said we&nbsp;are transiting from general partnership and now we have limited liability partnership.&nbsp; If you look at what is happening in Singapore today, it is not really difficult to get limited liability.&nbsp; Most companies in Singapore are exempt private companies and they do not file their accounts if they can have a declaration of solvency.&nbsp; Partnerships today, like legal firms or accountancy firms, can form themselves into a limited law corporation or a public accountant <p align=left>Column: 566</p>corporation.&nbsp; And, again, the reporting requirements are not much different from what we have in the LLP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Wang brought up the point - I think this is an important point - that&nbsp;notification is important.&nbsp; Now that there is going to be limited liability, we have to notify.&nbsp; And the Bill&nbsp;provides that, in your name or the partnership, you have to put down \"limited liability partnership\" or \"LLP\".&nbsp; In the case of a conversion, ie, when you are converting from a general partnership into an LLP, for a period of one year, in all your official correspondence you must state that you have now been converted into a limited liability partnership, so as to&nbsp;put those people who have been dealing with you on notice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Wang raised another point.&nbsp; He said that he was concerned whether with this limited liability partnership, the quality of the&nbsp;legal profession or accountancy profession will start to fall.&nbsp; I think that there are&nbsp;incentives to maintain high standards.&nbsp; One of them would be the fact that the limited liability partner would still be personally liable for his wrongful acts or omissions.&nbsp; So it is not as though that&nbsp;with limited liability partnership, when he is professionally negligent, that is actually capped.&nbsp; It is not capped.&nbsp; So, as I said earlier, he is liable to the full extent of his net worth.&nbsp; The other thing, of course, is that the LLP is simply a business form, a vehicle.&nbsp; The relevant professions will continue to regulate to ensure that standards are maintained.&nbsp; He mentioned&nbsp;the legal profession.&nbsp; That,&nbsp;again,&nbsp;the relevant authorities will regulate them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about having insurance?&nbsp; This is again a compliance cost issue, and we think that we have sufficient safeguards.&nbsp; No jurisdiction has imposed insurance&nbsp;on LLPs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 567</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Wang asked why is it that in the UK LLP Act, they made references to the&nbsp;Companies Act, and&nbsp;not in our case.&nbsp; We have drafted it differently.&nbsp; We have drafted it as self-contained, as he said, all in, whereas in the UK, their starting point is that the LLP is a company, and therefore they made a lot of references to the Companies Act. In our case, as I said, we have treated the LLP as essentially a partnership; hence the difference.&nbsp; And why have we done this?&nbsp; It is&nbsp;because we&nbsp;scan the existing LLP structures to ensure,&nbsp;in terms of business efficacy, we&nbsp;do not make the same mistakes as others have made.&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback has been that the UK LLP Act has been criticised because it is too close to&nbsp;being a company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof.&nbsp;Png brought up basically the point about tax treatment.&nbsp; As I said,&nbsp;we actually&nbsp;addressed that in the House&nbsp;last November.&nbsp;&nbsp;But just to clarify that, if you look at it at one&nbsp;particular level,&nbsp;this is really a timing issue.&nbsp; Because right now what we have is part of our tax feature, that companies can carry forward their losses against future profits.&nbsp; So, in the case of the LLP, we allow the particular LLP partners to offset their losses against their non-LLP income.&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is a cap, but&nbsp;you bring it a bit forward.&nbsp; Future losses can be offset against future LLP income.&nbsp; So it is principally a timing issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thank&nbsp;Members once again for their contributions and&nbsp;support of the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Wang Kai Yuen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, to bring that partner to court, I understand that he or she would have to be prosecuted under a different set of law, and probably the law <p align=left>Column: 568</p>of tort, which&nbsp;requires a different onus of proof, and makes it much more difficult to pursue the wrongdoing,&nbsp;whereas under partnership, of course, those do not exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;In creating LLP, perhaps we could also look into this consideration.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So, if you take two vehicles, a company that is sustaining losses that is going to go under and an&nbsp;LLP which is sustaining losses, someone may buy the LLP just for the losses to write off against their income, then it is not just a matter of timing, there is actually a revenue loss.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

With the LLP available from this year, amendments must be made to the Stamp Duties Act to prescribe the stamp duty treatment governing this new business form.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Stamp duty charge on transfer of properties on conversion to LLP</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the first amendment is to charge stamp duty when chargeable properties are transferred to LLPs upon conversion of&nbsp;partnerships or companies to LLPs.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 570</p> Stamp duty should be chargeable for such transfers, because the LLP is a legal person that is separate from the transferor. Clause 4 introduces a new section to treat the notice of registration issued by the Registrar of LLPs as a chargeable instrument for the transfer of properties to the LLP on conversion.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as a concession, I have decided to provide full relief from stamp duty for partnerships converting into LLPs under the LLP Act. To qualify, partners of the LLP must be the same persons in the partnership before conversion. Clause 3 amends the Act to effect this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concession would not be extended to companies converting to LLPs.&nbsp; This maintains the existing position that a company is a different person from its shareholders and stamp duty should be duly imposed if any properties are transferred.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><I>Stamp duty charge on transfer of partner's interest in LLP</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second amendment is to impose stamp duty when a significant change in partners takes place in an LLP that owns properties.&nbsp; This anti-avoidance measure is needed to prevent partners in an LLP from avoiding duty by selling their partnership interest instead of the properties directly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the intention is not to penalise LLPs which experience gradual changes in partners in the normal course of business, a 'significant change' shall be deemed to have occurred only if 50% of the partners have changed in the previous two years; or where 50% of partnership interest has been transferred to different persons in the previous two years.&nbsp; Clause 4 introduces a new section to provide for this anti-avoidance mechanism. Clause 5 makes consequential amendments to section 62 to stipulate offences for non-compliance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 571</p><p><I>Relief from stamp duty</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the third amendment is to introduce a new section 32B to grant relief from stamp duty in instances where double duty may arise.&nbsp; This will ensure that only one set of stamp duties would be imposed in the following three situations:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where an LLP acquires chargeable properties with admission of a new partner;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Where an LLP sells chargeable properties to an existing partner; and<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a significant change in partners takes place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore will issue a circular detailing these changes before March 2005.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;Sir, motor vehicle appraisers are engaged for damage assessment relating to accident insurance claims. Hence, their customers are mainly large insurance firms.&nbsp; Insurance companies have been taking active steps to protect their own interests.&nbsp; In 2002, the General Insurance Association established the Independent Damage Assessment Centres to prevent errant workshops from inflating claims.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill seeks to enact the new Diplomatic and Consular Relations Act which gives force of law in Singapore to relevant provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963.&nbsp; This Bill will repeal the existing Consular Conventions Act (Cap. 52) and the Diplomatic Privileges (Commonwealth Countries and Republic of Ireland) Act (Cap. 83) whose provisions<p align=left>Column: 575</p> will be superseded by the new Diplomatic and Consular Relations Act.&nbsp; The Bill will also make related amendments to the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134) and the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap. 179). <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is currently not a signatory to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963, although we follow closely the provisions of both Conventions in our dealings with foreign missions in Singapore and in managing our overseas missions in other countries.&nbsp; The two Conventions are universally recognised as customary international laws governing the protection and granting of privileges and immunities by the receiving State to diplomatic and consular missions and members of the missions so as to facilitate the smooth functioning of the foreign missions in the receiving State.&nbsp; To bring ourselves in line with international practices, Singapore has decided to accede to both the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, as well as the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, without any reservations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;I would like to highlight two key features of the Bill.&nbsp; Under Article 6, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has the prerogative to extend certain privileges and immunities to certain persons as deemed appropriate though they are not covered under the provisions of the two Conventions.&nbsp; This provision will allow Singapore to accommodate the requirements of International Organisations for their staff to enjoy certain diplomatic privileges and immunities while in Singapore on temporary assignments.&nbsp; Sir, such a move will help promote Singapore as a diplomatic hub and, also, as an&nbsp;international arbitration centre.&nbsp; In addition, the Minister for Foreign Affairs also has the prerogative to withdraw <p align=left>Column: 576</p>certain diplomatic privileges and immunities from a foreign mission on the basis of reciprocity.&nbsp; The principle of reciprocity is enshrined in Article 47 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and Article 72 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, and is a universally recognised practice in international relations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude, Sir,&nbsp;by saying that the passing of the Bill will put in place the necessary legislation for Singapore's accession to the two Conventions.&nbsp; Our accession will be one further demonstration of Singapore as a committed and responsible member of the international community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;

&nbsp;Sir, this Bill contains a range of amendments, arising from the Land Transport Authority (LTA)'s review of its rules to reduce red tape in the licensing of parking places.&nbsp; The amendments will not only serve to help businesses reduce costs of compliance but also improve the administration of parking places.

The Parking Places Act (or PPA) currently stipulates that all private parking places must be licensed.&nbsp; LTA has reviewed the need for licensing.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform the House that it intends to deregulate the licensing of private parking places for non-heavy vehicles, as proposed in clause 3.&nbsp; Doing away with this licensing requirement will be welcomed by the business community and will help reduce&nbsp;cost by an estimated $1 million annually.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;LTA has proposed the deregulation as the majority of the existing licensing conditions for these parking places, such as keeping the place in good and clean <p align=left>Column: 578</p>condition, and not permitting a vehicle to be parked in any manner that would obstruct free flow of traffic, are non-critical. Moreover, the operators' own vested interest will ensure that the parking places are managed prudently; in other words, industry self-regulation is feasible.&nbsp; Other conditions, such as the need to ensure that the private parking places continue to comply with the geometric and provision requirements and are not altered without the approval of the Authority,</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

For the remaining licensing conditions, these can be provided for explicitly in the PPA, which I will address next.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Authorisation of LTA staff to require private parking place operators to furnish information and to enter private parking places for survey or inspection</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, LTA today collects information, such as occupancy rates, parking charges and operation hours of private parking places.&nbsp; Such information is useful for the parking authority when it reviews the parking policies and establishes guidelines for new parking systems.&nbsp; Currently, LTA is also empowered to enter the premises of its licensees to investigate feedback on the inadequacies of the private parking places.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the deregulation of private parking places for non-heavy vehicles, LTA will still require certain information from the operators of private parking places.&nbsp; As the parking authority, it will also need to retain powers to enter these&nbsp;parking places to carry out inspections.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is no express provision in the PPA that provides for these powers, as prevailing licensing conditions <p align=left>Column: 579</p>allow the Authority to do so.&nbsp; As these conditions will cease to apply after the deregulation, clause 5 creates new sections in the PPA to empower the Authority and Superintendent to require private parking place operators to furnish information and to enter private parking places for survey or inspection, for purposes of the performance of the functions and duties under the PPA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Implementation of scripless Vehicle Parking Certificates (VPCs)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the PPA empowers LTA to make rules to regulate the parking of heavy vehicles through the issuance of Vehicle Parking Certificates (VPCs).&nbsp; To increase convenience to users by removing the need to physically apply for approvals and also to provide applicants more options, LTA intends to allow online application and approval of VPCs.&nbsp; Clause 4(a) amends the PPA to facilitate the issuance of VPCs in any form, including electronic form.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Facilitation of superintendents of car parks to install equipment in public parking places</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the administration of the PPA, an officer each from the HDB and URA are appointed as the Deputy Superintendent of Car Parks.&nbsp; These officers are responsible for managing the public parking places, including the installation of equipment in the public parking places for collecting parking charges.&nbsp; However, currently, only the Authority is empowered to install such equipment, thus making it a legal requirement for the Superintendents to seek LTA's approval.&nbsp; To streamline this process, clause 4(b) amends the rule-making powers of the LTA to enable the Superintendent to install equipment in public parking places without the need to obtain the approval of the Authority.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 580</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining amendments proposed in the Bill concern the transitional provisions and consequential amendments to the PPA arising from the amendments I have just outlined.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
