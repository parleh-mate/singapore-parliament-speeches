But for more detailed planning,  especially  of\r\n\r\nproviding bus services to the new estates, a lot depends on\r\n\r\nwhen the residents have moved into a particular area.

Members in this House, let me\r\n\r\nrecall  the lament of the British Prime Minister which  was\r\n\r\nreferred  to in the President's Address and which  our  own\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  reiterated yesterday.  The  British  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  was  said to have lamented that the most  hateful\r\n\r\nslogan  he has ever heard was made at the protest march  of\r\n\r\nMarxist infiltrators of his Labour Party:\r\n\r\n\"What  do we want? Everything. When do we want it? Now!\"  I\r\n\r\ncannot  agree  with him more, Sir, that this is  lamentable\r\n\r\nnot only because the demand was unreasonable and impossible\r\n\r\nto  meet but also because this is happening to a once-great\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds me of the analogical example of the sniffers\r\n\r\nof  roses  once  quoted  by our hon. Minister  for  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs. The sniffer of roses, upon discovering that a rose\r\n\r\nsmells  better than a cabbage or onion, concludes  that  it\r\n\r\nwill  make better soup. He therefore demands the soup while\r\n\r\nsniffing at the roses. On the other hand, the soup maker or\r\n\r\nthe so-called \"establishment\" unfortunately has to get down\r\n\r\nto  the  more  exacting  job of producing  the  soup  which\r\n\r\nnormally  falls short of expectation of the rose sniffers.\r\n\r\nSometimes they may not even meet the taste of every  Member\r\n\r\nin  this House. Sir, I am not for a moment suggesting  that\r\n\r\nthe hon. Members on the other side of this House or on this\r\n\r\nside  of  the House are sniffers of roses. I have  not  the\r\n\r\nslightest intention of implying so. Sir.

What  I  said was that there  should  be  overall\r\n\r\nplanning so as to provide bus services to the residents  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  towns, because public transportation is a natural\r\n\r\nexpectation  of the residents. Surely, when  the  residents\r\n\r\nmove in, bus services must naturally follow.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, the answer to the query is: there\r\n\r\nactually  is.  The SBS is, in fact, liaising  very  closely\r\n\r\nwith  the HDB on this matter. When a new town is opened  up\r\n\r\nand  people  begin moving in, bus services are provided  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  The  level  of  services,  that  is.  the\r\n\r\nfrequency and types of services, increases as more and more\r\n\r\npeople move in. Good examples are Ang Mo Kio and Bedok  New\r\n\r\nTown.  Telok  Blangah  New  Town  and  other  new  estates,\r\n\r\nincluding  industrial  estates, will  have  more  and  more\r\n\r\nservices as they fill up. I have no doubt that in  view  of\r\n\r\nwhat  I  said earlier, quoting Confucius. the hon.  Members\r\n\r\nwould  appreciate  that  it  is  not  always  possible   or\r\n\r\npracticable to provide everything all at the same time.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each month, SBS adds 10 to 20 new buses to its fleet.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  fleet is increasing, but these  new  buses\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  allocated to the various new  towns  and  new\r\n\r\nestates. In other words, each new town or estate will  have\r\n\r\nits fair share of bus services,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the request for improvement of the\r\n\r\ntransport services in the rural areas, made by the  Members\r\n\r\nfor  Bukit Panjang and for Punggol. I would like to  assure\r\n\r\nthem  that  the SBS, in its efforts to upgrade its  island-wide  services  will not overlook the requirements  of  the\r\n\r\nrural areas,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has suggested that canteens and\r\n\r\ntoilets  for  bus  employees  should  be  set  up  at   bus\r\n\r\nterminals. The SBS management is conscious of the  need  to\r\n\r\nprovide  proper facilities because they lead to an increase\r\n\r\nof  moral  and  higher  efficiency of the  staff.  Wherever\r\n\r\npracticable, toilets have been built and canteens  provided\r\n\r\neven  to  the extent of building \"bus canteens\".  that  is,\r\n\r\nconverting  old  bus bodies into canteens  as  a  temporary\r\n\r\nmeasure. Improvements, unfortunately have not been as rapid\r\n\r\nas  the  management  would want to see,  for  a  number  of\r\n\r\nreasons,  among  which are the unavailability  of  land  to\r\n\r\nbuild  these facilities, uncertainty over long-term  status\r\n\r\nof  the land, the temporary nature of some locations and so\r\n\r\non.   Where  the  long-term  status  of  the  terminal   is\r\n\r\ndetermined  and  where land is available,  proper  terminal\r\n\r\nfacilities have been developed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Paya Lebar International Airport, for example, a\r\n\r\nnew  terminal has been built and another one would soon  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  at  Jurong, The SBS is now  making  a  concerted\r\n\r\neffort   to  upgrade  all  sub-standard  terminals.   Since\r\n\r\nSeptember  last year. Sir, it has embarked  on  a  terminal\r\n\r\nimprovement programme. Various Government authorities, such\r\n\r\nas  the  Registry of Vehicles, the Public Works  Department\r\n\r\nand  the Housing and Development Board, are cooperating  to\r\n\r\nimprove and, where possible. to build proper terminals.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as with all limited resources, improvements cost\r\n\r\nmoney  and,  therefore, would have to  be  carried  Out  in\r\n\r\nstages over the next three to five years.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee has suggested that more women\r\n\r\nshould be employed by the SBS and trained to be bus drivers\r\n\r\nand  conductors because they are not as impatient and  rude\r\n\r\nas  men. I agree with his observation. With the recruitment\r\n\r\nof  female  bus  conductors, the number  of  complaints  of\r\n\r\nrudeness  from commuters has dropped and the bus conductors\r\n\r\nare now more courteous in their work. The policy of the SBS\r\n\r\nwith  regard to recruitment since August 1974 has  been  to\r\n\r\nengage women to work as bus conductors. Equal encouragement\r\n\r\nhas  also  been given to the recruitment of  women  as  bus\r\n\r\ndrivers. As a result of this policy almost one-third of the\r\n\r\nbus conductors in the SBS now are women. The recruitment of\r\n\r\nwomen   as  bus  drivers  has  been,  unfortunately,   less\r\n\r\nsuccessful.  The  staffing position  of  bus  crew  in  the\r\n\r\nCompany  as at 31st January this year is as follows.  There\r\n\r\nis  a  total of 3,592 bus conductors and 3,737 bus drivers,\r\n\r\nOf  these,  1,121  bus conductors and 34  bus  drivers  are\r\n\r\nwomen.  Although the SBS has tried every means  to  attract\r\n\r\nwomen to join the Company as bus conductors, the supply  is\r\n\r\ntapering  off, with the result that men have to be employed\r\n\r\nagain as bus conductors so as to obtain a sufficient number\r\n\r\nof  conductors to pair off with the bus drivers to meet the\r\n\r\nimmediate shortage. In spite of this move, the SBS is\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nstill making every effort to encourage women to be employed\r\n\r\nas bus drivers and conductors,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now refer to the point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nMoulmein  on  whether  or not the  objective  of  the  Area\r\n\r\nLicensing Scheme (ALS) would still be served by terminating\r\n\r\nthe  hours of restriction at 9.45 a.m. instead of 10.15 a.m. Hon.  Members will recall that when the ALS was  introduced\r\n\r\nin June 1975 the hours of restriction were from 7.30 a.m. to 9.30  a.m. While the number of motor vehicles entering  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Business District (CBD) was substantially  reduced\r\n\r\nduring   those  hours  of  restriction,  traffic  increased\r\n\r\nconsiderably after 9.30 a.m. giving rise to severe  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion along the major roads on the fringe of  the  CBD\r\n\r\nbetween  9.30 a.m. and 10.00 a.m. From August 1975 the  hours\r\n\r\nof  restriction  were  extended  to  10.15  a.m.  This  had\r\n\r\neffectively eliminated traffic congestion between 9.30  a.m. and  10.15 a.m. There was still, however, an upsurge in  the\r\n\r\nvolume  of traffic entering the CBD between 10.15  a.m.  and 10.45 a.m., but the congestion was of a reduced scale and of\r\n\r\nshort  duration. Observations of traffic conditions  up  to\r\n\r\nthe end of last year indicate that there has been a gradual\r\n\r\nupward  creep  in  the post-10.15 a.m.  traffic  volume  in\r\n\r\nrecent  months.  Therefore, shortening  of  the  restricted\r\n\r\nhours now would certainly result in a further deterioration\r\n\r\nof  traffic  conditions  and the  need  again  for  further\r\n\r\nrestraint.  It would be prudent, therefore, to  retain  the\r\n\r\npresent hours of restraint, that is, from 7.30 a.m. to 10.15 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah spoke on the lighterage trade\r\n\r\nand  suggested  that  the breakwater at  Pasir  Panjang  be\r\n\r\nextended  to  make the water there safer  for  lighters  to\r\n\r\noperate. The PSA wants the lighterage trade to continue  as\r\n\r\nit  supplements the normal cargo traffic. Because  of  this\r\n\r\nthe PSA is developing Pasir Panjang with a lighterage cargo\r\n\r\nhandling  and  mooring  area.  Before  completion  of   the\r\n\r\nbreakwater,  the waters at Pasir Panjang were quite  choppy\r\n\r\nand not too conducive for the handling of cargo to and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nfrom lighters. Since September last year when the two\r\n\r\narms of the breakwater costing almost $6 million were\r\n\r\ncompleted, lighters could safely moor and operate  at\r\n\r\nPasir  Panjang.  The  PSA  is  in  contact  with  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Lighter Owner's Association  on  this  and\r\n\r\nother  matters concerning lighterage.  and  they  are\r\n\r\npresently  satisfied  with the  water  conditions  at\r\n\r\nPasir  Panjang.  In fact, since November  last  year.\r\n\r\nwith  the introduction of the reduced tariff and  the\r\n\r\ncompletion of the breakwater at Pasir Panjang.  there\r\n\r\nhas  been  a  sharp increase in the lighterage  cargo\r\n\r\nfrom  an  average  of 21,269 tonnes  per  month  from\r\n\r\nJanuary to October last year to an average of  67,483\r\n\r\ntonnes  per month from November last year to  January\r\n\r\nthis  year.  To further promote the lighterage  trade\r\n\r\nand  to allow for a lighterage operation at both  the\r\n\r\nEastern  and  Western Anchorages,  the  PSA  is  also\r\n\r\nconsidering  providing  a lighter  mooring  area  for\r\n\r\nabout 60 lighters alongside the HDB reclaimed land at\r\n\r\nTelok Aver Basin.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah also spoke on behalf\r\n\r\nof  those  who were unsuccessful in their application\r\n\r\nfor PSA passes for entry into the PSA. The Member for\r\n\r\nTelok Blangah may wish to take note of this. The  PSA\r\n\r\nissues  more than 102,000 passes to port users  valid\r\n\r\nas  at  end of last year. In a representative  survey\r\n\r\ncarried  out  last  year, out of a  total  number  of\r\n\r\n13,507  applications  for  PSA  passes,  12,995  were\r\n\r\napproved  outright. Upon appeal,  an  additional  187\r\n\r\nwere granted PSA passes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it can be seen that there is actually only a\r\n\r\nvery  small  fraction of about  2.4%  of  the  total\r\n\r\napplications not given passes to enter the  PSA  port\r\n\r\narea.  The PSA has the responsibility to ensure  that\r\n\r\nits premises are kept reasonably safe, and that entry\r\n\r\nis  confined  to  those who have legitimate  business\r\n\r\nwith  the port. The port users must generally  be  of\r\n\r\nacceptable  character  and  who  would  not  cause  a\r\n\r\nnuisance  to  the  port in one  way  or  another  The\r\n\r\nreputation  of  the PSA as a generally pilferage-free\r\n\r\nport with good security has to be safeguarded and, as\r\n\r\nsuch,  the  Authority cannot approve all applications\r\n\r\nwithout proper screening.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, on a point of clarification.

Member for Marine Parade suggested that we should\r\n\r\nstrive to be a world transhipment centre and not just  rest\r\n\r\non  our  laurels as a regional warehousing and transhipment\r\n\r\ncentre. This is exactly what we are striving to be.  It  is\r\n\r\nonly  due  to  modesty  that  we  use  the  term  \"regional\r\n\r\ntranshipment centre\" instead of \"world transhipment centre\"\r\n\r\nin the Addendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port of Singapore Authority is presently offering a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  incentives to encourage cargo  transhipment  at\r\n\r\nSingapore. Incentives are in the form of lower charges  for\r\n\r\nstevedorage and wharf handling for conventional cargo.  For\r\n\r\ncontainerised  cargo  the charge for  stevedorage  is  also\r\n\r\nreduced by half from $200 to $100 per 20-foot container. In\r\n\r\naddition,  for  both conventional and containerised  cargo,\r\n\r\nfree  storage up to 28 days is given as against the  normal\r\n\r\n72  hours  free storage given for local cargo.  Cargo  from\r\n\r\nconventional  vessels  to be transhipped  on  to  container\r\n\r\nlines  are given a tariff incentive of $4 per tonne rebate.\r\n\r\nThese incentives have assisted Singapore's development as a\r\n\r\nregional   transhipment  centre.   To   encourage   further\r\n\r\ndevelopment    of    Singapore   as   an   intercontinental\r\n\r\ntranshipment  centre, particularly for cargo  from  Europe,\r\n\r\nMediterranean and Middle East to Australia and New Zealand,\r\n\r\nthe PSA is developing the inland container depot which will\r\n\r\nprovide  cheaper  storage for containers  both  loaded  and\r\n\r\nempty. The ample space at the inland depot would also allow\r\n\r\nfor  cargo  consolidation and repacking which are sometimes\r\n\r\nnecessary   before  transhipment.  If  necessary,   further\r\n\r\nincentives  in the form of tariff or other incentives  will\r\n\r\nbe considered.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Alexandra has suggested that air cargo\r\n\r\ncharter  services  be allowed to operate out  of  Singapore\r\n\r\noffering rates lower than regular scheduled airlines so  as\r\n\r\nto  allow our export industries to transport their goods to\r\n\r\nthe  markets  at  lower cost. The hon. Member  is  probably\r\n\r\naware  that  freight  rates for air cargo  charters  are  a\r\n\r\nmatter   of   agreement  between  airline   operators   and\r\n\r\ncharterers or shippers. This agreed rate is\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ndetermined  by market forces and is usually different  from\r\n\r\nthe  published rate for scheduled airlines. One of the main\r\n\r\naims  of Government is to develop Singapore as an air cargo\r\n\r\ndistribution  and  storage centre.  And  in  pursuing  this\r\n\r\nobjective.  Sir, the operation of both scheduled  and  non-scheduled  airlines, including air cargo charter  services,\r\n\r\nwill  be encouraged.

Members  concerning the Ministry of Home  Affairs.  I\r\n\r\nwill now deal with them subject by subject.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on internal security. Sir, I am gratified to note\r\n\r\nthat  among  the  subjects  under  Home  Affairs,  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity was the subject which received the most attention.\r\n\r\nAll  those  who spoke on it agreed that the communists  are\r\n\r\nand  will  remain  the main threat to Singapore's  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity.  Some  Members  rightly  stressed  the  need  for\r\n\r\nvigilance not only on the part of the authorities but  also\r\n\r\namongst  our people. This is crucial because the communists\r\n\r\nwill   use  every  means  at  their  disposal  to   subvert\r\n\r\nindividuals and organisations and use them to advance their\r\n\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve their objectives they will not hesitate to\r\n\r\nemploy every form of deceit and treachery, use violence and\r\n\r\ncommit  any  crime including murder. They  believe  in  the\r\n\r\nphilosophy  that the end justifies the means. They  operate\r\n\r\nclandestinely through their underground network. When  they\r\n\r\nhave  ensnared sufficient numbers of open front leaders  in\r\n\r\nmass  organisations to act as their proxies  above  ground,\r\n\r\nthen  they would launch what is known as a Communist United\r\n\r\nFront  offensive and create strikes. riots and  instability\r\n\r\nas in the 1950s and early 1960s in Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs has taken great pains to\r\n\r\npublicise  and expose their machinations after every  major\r\n\r\nsecurity operation. It is hoped that this would educate our\r\n\r\npublic  and  keep  them constantly on their  guard  against\r\n\r\nattempts at subversion by the communists.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Khe Bong managed to draw laughter in\r\n\r\nthis  House  when  he spoke on internal security.  However.\r\n\r\nthere  are  one  or  two points that he  raised  which  are\r\n\r\nserious  and  need to be replied to. He had suggested  that\r\n\r\ninternal  security measures taken are still inadequate  and\r\n\r\nnot  thorough enough. He referred to G. Raman and asked why\r\n\r\nwas it that he had not been arrested earlier since he was a\r\n\r\ncommunist some time ago.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is that G. Raman did come to our security\r\n\r\nnotice  quite some time ago. But it is not necessarily  the\r\n\r\nbest  strategy of combating communist subversion by  making\r\n\r\nan  immediate  arrest  once  a single  communist  has  been\r\n\r\nidentified. We should first try to identify his  associates\r\n\r\nso  that  they also can be taken in. On this,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nexercise  great care and thoroughness in our investigations\r\n\r\nto   ensure  that  the  wrong  persons  are  not  detained.\r\n\r\nOtherwise our action will be counterproductive.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink I should go further than this in my explanation  lest\r\n\r\nwe unwittingly give away information of our strategy to our\r\n\r\nenemy. What I would like to emphasise here is that the real\r\n\r\ntest   of   the  effectiveness  of  our  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nDepartment  is not whether communists and other  subversive\r\n\r\ngroups  continue  to  exist but  rather  whether  they  are\r\n\r\nidentified and dealt with before they can do any real harm.\r\n\r\nOn this, Sir, the records of ISO's achievements not only in\r\n\r\nthe  present  G  Raman's case but also  in  smashing  other\r\n\r\nunderground   communist  groups  and  network   speak   for\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Khe Bong has also suggested that\r\n\r\ninformation be gathered from Government departments.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know exactly what he has in mind. But I would like  to\r\n\r\nassure  him that no effort has been and will be  spared  to\r\n\r\ngather information of security\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ninterest not only from Government departments, schools, but\r\n\r\nalso  elsewhere.  The ISD will continue  to  take  periodic\r\n\r\nsecurity action to pre-empt the communists underground  and\r\n\r\nkeep them on the run.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Leng Kee, while stating that hardcore\r\n\r\ncommunists  should  be severely dealt with,  has  suggested\r\n\r\nthat   students  and  youths  who  had  been  misled   into\r\n\r\nsupporting  the  communists should be  given  a  chance  to\r\n\r\ncorrect themselves. In answer, may I just refer to  what  I\r\n\r\nsaid  in a TV interview in the programme entitled \"Year-End\r\n\r\nRoundup 1976\". And I quote:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'in the security operations, the powers of detention under\r\n\r\nthe  internal  Security Act were used discriminately.  Only\r\n\r\nthe hardcore and those who refuse to recant their communist\r\n\r\ninvolvement were issued with Orders of Detention.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students who were released went back to their studies.\r\n\r\nThose  who  had  superficial involvements  were  called  up\r\n\r\ntogether  with their parents and warned of the  dangers  of\r\n\r\nassociations with communist subversives.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>However,  this programme was broadcast during the midst  of\r\n\r\nthe  1976 General Elections, I am sure the Member for  Leng\r\n\r\nKee  was busy campaigning at that time and must have missed\r\n\r\nthe programme.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to road safety I must confess that I am somewhat\r\n\r\ndisappointed  that only a few Members had any  comments  or\r\n\r\nsuggestions.

He\r\n\r\nsaid  that it was an example of \"legislative overkill\".  He\r\n\r\ncontended  that  the  drivers  of  smaller  vehicles   like\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists and scooterists could be equally at fault. He\r\n\r\ncalled for the problem to be tackled by other measures such\r\n\r\nas  education. stricter enforcement. more severe punishment\r\n\r\nfor those found guilty.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer, let me first put this proposal for change in\r\n\r\nthe  law  in its proper perspective. It is not an  isolated\r\n\r\nproposal  but  it  is  part of a series  of  new  and  more\r\n\r\nvigorous   measures  which  included  greater  efforts   in\r\n\r\neducating road users in the highway code. culminating\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  a  nationwide  \"Road Safety For You\" Campaign  in  June\r\n\r\n1977.

I agree that there is  \"overkill\"\r\n\r\nbut  not  in the proposal to change the law. The \"overkill\"\r\n\r\nis  that  which lies on our roads. Nowadays it  is  not  an\r\n\r\nunfamiliar  sight  to see dead bodies lying  on  our  roads\r\n\r\nafter a motor accident. We must put a stop to this by using\r\n\r\nevery  means  at our disposal.

It should not be judged on the basis  of  some\r\n\r\npreconceived hypothetical concepts of what is equitable  or\r\n\r\nnot.  The  crux  of the matter here is not discharging  the\r\n\r\nburden  of  proof  in a court of law or  having  a  driving\r\n\r\nlicence  suspended, but the killing and  maiming  of  human\r\n\r\nbeings that must be prevented\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In each of the last three years the number of road\r\n\r\nfatalities  hovered around 288 This means that  on  average\r\n\r\nthere were three deaths on the roads in every four days Are\r\n\r\nthe large and small vehicles equally responsible? The heavy\r\n\r\nvehicles such as buses and trucks represented 6.7%  of  all\r\n\r\nmotorised vehicles registered in Singapore as at the end of\r\n\r\n1976.  However.  they were involved in 35.5%  of  all  road\r\n\r\naccidents Almost 30% of these accidents resulted in  death.\r\n\r\nThese  heavy  vehicles therefore had much more  than  their\r\n\r\nshare of accidents and fatal accidents.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous cases of road fatalities in which the\r\n\r\noffending driver cannot be charged in court or is acquitted\r\n\r\nby  the court because there is no eye-witness. I would like\r\n\r\nto mention two cases pertaining to a driver which will best\r\n\r\nillustrate why the present proposal for change in  the  law\r\n\r\nhas been made The consequences of the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ninadequacy of the law were indeed very tragic. In May  1969\r\n\r\na  motor  van  after  overtaking a scooter  from  the  left\r\n\r\ncallously  swerved into the scooterist's path  and  stopped\r\n\r\nsuddenly. The scooter could not stop or turn in time and as\r\n\r\na  result  of the collision the scooterist was killed.  The\r\n\r\ndriver  of  the van was charged in court but was  acquitted\r\n\r\nbecause  there was no eye-witness. Thus the driver  of  the\r\n\r\nlarger vehicle escaped unhurt and unpunished.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 3 1/2 years later in May 1972 the same driver, may I\r\n\r\nrepeat, the same driver, killed again. This time there  was\r\n\r\n\"overkill\". The truck he was driving collided head-on  with\r\n\r\na  small car. wiping out four members of a family of  five,\r\n\r\nincluding both father and mother who were in that  car  The\r\n\r\nsole survivor of that unfortunate family was a 13-year  old\r\n\r\nboy  who became an orphan Some hon Members will recall this\r\n\r\nvery tragic accident at Bartley Road which was published in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers.  Fortunately there was an eye-witness  who\r\n\r\nwas  willing  to come forward to testify. The killer-driver\r\n\r\nwas  subsequently convicted in court and sentenced to  nine\r\n\r\nmonths' imprisonment with 10 years of disqualification from\r\n\r\ndriving all classes of vehicles.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two cases illustrate clearly that the driver and\r\n\r\npassengers in the vehicle of a lighter class are much  more\r\n\r\nvulnerable  in  a  collision with a vehicle  of  a  heavier\r\n\r\nclass.  On  the  other  hand, the drivers  of  these  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicles  like trucks. buses. oil tankers, timber  lorries,\r\n\r\nmobile cranes and cement mixers, know that in any collision\r\n\r\nwith  a  smaller vehicle they will be quite safe  in  their\r\n\r\ndriver's  cabin a few feet from the ground. If  the  driver\r\n\r\nand  passengers of the small vehicle are killed,  there  is\r\n\r\nevery  likelihood that he would get away scot-free if there\r\n\r\nis   no  other  eyewitness  to  the  collision  No  wonder,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that he suffers from the mentality that  \"might\r\n\r\nis  right\" and having little courtesy and caring  less  for\r\n\r\nother road users\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol, unfortunately he is not around, in\r\n\r\nsupporting  the  sentiments expressed  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKallang cited two hypothetical examples in which the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ndriver  of  the heavier vehicle would be unfairly penalised\r\n\r\nunder  the proposals to change the law. I am afraid he  has\r\n\r\nnot  completely  understood the changes proposed.  Let  me,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  hasten  to  assure  him  that  under  the   new\r\n\r\nproposals  the  drivers  in his two  hypothetical  examples\r\n\r\nwould  not be penalised simply because they are not in  the\r\n\r\nwrong.  If  the driver of the heavy vehicle is not  in  the\r\n\r\nwrong,  he can easily rebut the presumption by telling  the\r\n\r\ntruth of what happened. The intention of the change is  not\r\n\r\nto  put difficulties in the way of the driver of the  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicle but to prevent him from getting away scot-free when\r\n\r\nhe is, in fact, in the wrong because there are no other eye\r\n\r\nwitnesses  to the collision except himself. With regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  proposal  to suspend the licence of the  driver  in  a\r\n\r\nfatal  accident who is charged in court, let me  point  out\r\n\r\nthat  a  person  is charged in court for dangerous  driving\r\n\r\nonly when there is a prima facie case against him.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must make every effort to stop this senseless killing\r\n\r\nand  maiming  on our roads by introducing more  discipline,\r\n\r\ncare  and courtesy among all our road users. This  will  be\r\n\r\ndone  in  the next three years by systematically  educating\r\n\r\nour road users both young and old. and following it up with\r\n\r\ntougher enforcement of the law. The law will be changed  if\r\n\r\nthey are found to be inadequate. Let me assure hon. Members\r\n\r\nthat the problem will be approached from all angles and  it\r\n\r\nwill  be dealt with as comprehensively as possible. It will\r\n\r\ncover all road users. Not only bullies driving heavy trucks\r\n\r\nand  buses  will be brought to book but also  mindless  and\r\n\r\nreckless young scooterists, and motorcyclists who weave  in\r\n\r\nand  out of traffic lanes and motorists who treat the roads\r\n\r\nas race tracks will find themselves taken off the roads, by\r\n\r\nhaving  their  licences suspended for their own  safety  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  of  others. To achieve this, the  Points  Demerit\r\n\r\nSystem   will   be  revised  so  that  offences   such   as\r\n\r\ninconsiderate, careless and dangerous driving  will,  carry\r\n\r\nmore penalty points.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this systematic campaign has already started. A\r\n\r\nseries  of  mini campaigns through the press and  RTS  have\r\n\r\nalready\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncommenced  by the traffic police since October  last  year.\r\n\r\nEach  of  these  mini campaigns has a  theme  such  as  \"No\r\n\r\nReckless  Overtaking\",  \"No Road  Hogging\",  \"Give  Way  to\r\n\r\nPedestrians\", \"Keep in Lane\" and \"How to Turn Right\".  This\r\n\r\nwill  culminate  in a nationwide campaign  in  June  to  be\r\n\r\ncalled  \"Road Safety For You\". There will be a Road  Safety\r\n\r\nExhibition  initially  at the Victoria  Memorial  Hall  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently at selected community centres. Publicity  will\r\n\r\nbe  given  through films and slides over  TV,  posters  and\r\n\r\nother  material.  It  will  also cover  jaywalking.  School\r\n\r\nchildren will be extensively involved in these campaigns.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me turn to another deadly business. drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking. The Member for Changi expressed the view  that\r\n\r\ndrug traffickers are not taking seriously the death penalty\r\n\r\nwhich they must face if they are caught. He has asked  what\r\n\r\nfurther  steps the Government intends to take against  drug\r\n\r\ntraffickers.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the death penalty for drug\r\n\r\ntraffickers, nine have been sentenced to death. Another  30\r\n\r\npersons  will face the death sentence if they are convicted\r\n\r\nin the High Court.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full impact of the death penalty will only reach the\r\n\r\ndrug  traffickers when the first of their kind who has been\r\n\r\nsentenced to death is actually hanged. This will take  some\r\n\r\ntime  because  of  the process of appeal  in  our  judicial\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime so long as there is a strong demand for\r\n\r\ndrugs   the  traffickers  will  still  find  the   business\r\n\r\nattractive. The Government has worked out a new strategy to\r\n\r\nhit  hard  at both the demand and supply sides of the  drug\r\n\r\nproblem.  The less specialised, more labour-intensive  work\r\n\r\nof  rounding up drug abusers and drug addicts will  devolve\r\n\r\nlargely  on  the Police, the Special Constabulary  and  the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps.  The Central Narcotics Bureau  will  then\r\n\r\nhave  more  time  and  resources  to  concentrate  on  drug\r\n\r\ntraffickers   and  pushers.  The  CNB  has  established   a\r\n\r\nSurveillance  Unit  with handpicked  officers  and  advance\r\n\r\nradio communication equipment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention at this stage that I will soon be\r\n\r\nintroducing amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act  to  give\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  powers to the enforcement agencies  and  to\r\n\r\nremove  obstructions in dealing with drug abusers and  drug\r\n\r\naddicts, Steps are being taken to convert some old quarters\r\n\r\ninto another Drug Rehabilitation Centre. As soon as this is\r\n\r\nready, \"Operation Ferret\" will be launched to round up drug\r\n\r\nabusers  and  addicts on a large scale. This is  absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary  if we are to prevent them from infecting  others\r\n\r\nand spreading further the drug epidemic.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the subject of Citizenship. The Member for\r\n\r\nMoulmein  has  called the Government to be  a  little  more\r\n\r\nliberal in granting citizenship to more deserving cases who\r\n\r\nare  holders of Singapore blue identity cards.  The  Member\r\n\r\nfor Kolam Ayer has called for a total review of citizenship\r\n\r\npolicy especially in respect of those holding blue identity\r\n\r\ncards for more than 10 years.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent residents, especially if they are blue identity\r\n\r\ncard  holders and are the only members in their family  who\r\n\r\nare   not   citizens,  are  already  being  given   special\r\n\r\nconsideration.  In 1976 this category accounted  for  about\r\n\r\n40% of all the citizenships approved.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a review of citizenship policy, I wish to reassure\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Kolam Ayer that the criteria for  assessing\r\n\r\napplications   are  reviewed  when  circumstances   change.\r\n\r\nHowever, such reviews must be within the framework  of  the\r\n\r\ntenets   which  have  been  stated  in  Parliament  before.\r\n\r\nBriefly, these are:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The granting of citizenship is not a right but a\r\n\r\nprivilege;\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In considering applications for citizenship, the\r\n\r\neconomic and social problems of the Republic must be  taken\r\n\r\ninto account; and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The main criterion is that every non-citizen who\r\n\r\nbecomes  a citizen must be an asset and not a liability  to\r\n\r\nour Republic.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first of all\r\n\r\nexpress my gratification at the increasing economic content\r\n\r\nof  the  speeches in this House. They come  not  only  from\r\n\r\nleading  lights  of  the  academic, banking  and  insurance\r\n\r\nprofessions in this House - we have always had, of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of economic advice from established  Members,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  my  colleague,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and\r\n\r\nMinister of Defence, or the Member for Whampoa - but we now\r\n\r\nhave  also  among  our  numerate brethren  the  recent  and\r\n\r\nobviously  highly stimulating additions to our  membership,\r\n\r\nand  I  look forward to the contribution they will make  to\r\n\r\nour  debates. However, even our non-economist Members  also\r\n\r\nappear  to  have  become  more  economics-minded,   I   was\r\n\r\nfascinated at the sitting two days ago by my colleague, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Social Affairs, and his facility  in  quoting\r\n\r\nfigures  analysing  the  cost of  the  public  subsidy  for\r\n\r\nplaying fields. and how much Government was paying for each\r\n\r\nmember  of  the small team of 11 soccer players  using  the\r\n\r\nplaying fields.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the business proper of answering the\r\n\r\nquestions or comments by Members. I have in my list some 20\r\n\r\nmatters for reply. They can be divided into two categories.\r\n\r\nThe  first  category  on  economic, industrial  sector  and\r\n\r\nmanpower planning which is of a general policy nature,  and\r\n\r\nthe  second, on the civil service establishment, budget and\r\n\r\ntax  matters which are more on points of detail, and should\r\n\r\nperhaps  be  more appropriately considered  in  the  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first category, the Member for Marine Parade\r\n\r\ntouched  on  the  economic growth rate, the  importance  of\r\n\r\nexport-led   growth   as  against  pump-priming   and   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of better labour statistics through  using  CPF\r\n\r\nrecords.  The Member for Whampoa emphasised the  importance\r\n\r\nof developing service industries, of trade diversification,\r\n\r\nof  assistance  to  expansion of  existing  industries,  of\r\n\r\ntechnical  supporting facilities to industry,  particularly\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncalibration.  The  Member for Sembawang was  interested  in\r\n\r\nencouraging the consumption of local products. On  manpower\r\n\r\nplanning. the Member for Paya Lebar emphasised the need  to\r\n\r\nensure  adequate training by employers. The Member for  Nee\r\n\r\nSoon  wanted  a  guarantee of employment for  graduates  of\r\n\r\ninstitutions  of higher learning. The Member for  Alexandra\r\n\r\nwished to encourage more female participation in the labour\r\n\r\nforce  by consulting women's organisations. And the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang  wanted  to reduce the differential  between\r\n\r\nprofessional  and  ordinary workers  in  order  to  correct\r\n\r\nshortages  of workers and avoid employing foreign  workers.\r\n\r\nThis  is really the subject of income redistribution  which\r\n\r\nis now in much high fashion amongst economists all over the\r\n\r\nworld.  So  the Member for Sembawang has really joined  the\r\n\r\nlist of economics-minded Members.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list is formidable. Before I answer them, I would like\r\n\r\nto  begin  by first saying a word on economic planning.  We\r\n\r\nstarted the first Plan in 1959 but rapidly-unfolding events\r\n\r\nsoon  overtook  this and other plans that we prepared.  The\r\n\r\nbasis  of our economic planning was upset when in  1963  we\r\n\r\nbecame part of Malaysia, then in 1965 we had Separation. In\r\n\r\n1967 we had the first intimation of the British rundown  of\r\n\r\nthe military bases. In 1969 we had the rundown accelerated.\r\n\r\nIn  1973  we  had the oil crisis. In 1974 we had  inflation\r\n\r\nbecause of a 300% increase in rice prices. All these events\r\n\r\nplayed  havoc with our four to five year plans. We may  now\r\n\r\nhave  come  back to more stable conditions. but it  is  too\r\n\r\nmuch  to  hope, with the history of economic turbulence  we\r\n\r\nhave had. that this will last indefinitely.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic plan therefore is what they call a rolling\r\n\r\nplan  with  52 equations which we can revise at  will  with\r\n\r\nchanging  conditions. There is another plan.  The  Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority  of Singapore has a slightly different  model  of\r\n\r\nthe economy with 22 equations which comes out with slightly\r\n\r\ndifferent projections.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These enable us, through the computer which speeds up the\r\n\r\ncalculations, to forecast\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ngrowth rates or requirements, for example in:-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) real GDP as a whole. and in the various sectors of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing,  commerce, financial and  business  sources,\r\n\r\nconstruction, transport, storage and communication.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) real consumption expenditure as a whole, and by the\r\n\r\nGovernment and private sector.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) real fixed investments as a whole, and by the public\r\n\r\nand private sectors.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) exports as a whole, and broken down into goods and\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) imports, as a whole, and for goods and services, and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) the GDP deflator.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must. of course, use the model and its projections\r\n\r\nwith some judgement.

Garbage\r\n\r\nout.\"  If we feed in rubbish, we get rubbish. We are  still\r\n\r\ntesting  the  model and do not yet consider it sufficiently\r\n\r\nsatisfactory for publication.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that cautionary note, perhaps I can now consider the\r\n\r\nfirst  question. The Member for Marine Parade has commented\r\n\r\nas follows: [col. 79]:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister for Finance in his addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Address  has  not  stated  whether  the  6-8%\r\n\r\nexpected  growth rate is real growth or growth in  monetary\r\n\r\nterms.  I  presume  it is the former  Still.  it  would  be\r\n\r\ninteresting  to know what sort of inflation rate  has  been\r\n\r\nallowed for.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to this question is that the 6-8% overall growth\r\n\r\nrate  projected in my economic model refers to real growth.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is difficult to project inflation rates for the\r\n\r\nnext few years. our model has assumed an inflation rate  of\r\n\r\n5-6%  taking into account the average inflation rate of  7%\r\n\r\nexpected by the OECD countries over the next few years.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next suggestion was [col. 80]:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also do not know whether the expected growth in the\r\n\r\ncountry  will be export-led or generated mainly by domestic\r\n\r\npump-priming We know. however, that the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  make  finance  for  exports  more  easily\r\n\r\navailable  .  .  Singapore has always  recorded  a  chronic\r\n\r\ndeficit in merchandise trade. This is not worrying  per  se\r\n\r\nas we have no natural resources and must import most of the\r\n\r\nthings we need What is worrying, however. is the continuous\r\n\r\ngrowth of the deficit.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the Member for Marine Parade is that in our\r\n\r\nstrategy  for growth in view of our open economy,  we  have\r\n\r\nalways  depended on exports as the source  of  growth.  Our\r\n\r\neconomy  has  been  and  will  continue  to  be  externally\r\n\r\noriented  not  only in trade but also in manufacturing  and\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also warned about our trade deficit growing.\r\n\r\nThough  our  trade deficit has widened in  absolute  terms,\r\n\r\nthis is to be expected for a growing economy like Singapore\r\n\r\nwith no natural resources. However, this does not mean that\r\n\r\nour  trade performance has not improved. Our trade  deficit\r\n\r\nas  a  share of total exports has declined from 58% in 1970\r\n\r\nto  38%  in 1976, Domestic exports now account for  58%  of\r\n\r\ntotal  exports compared to 36% in 1968. Over the next  five\r\n\r\nyears,  my  Ministry  will continue to accord  priority  to\r\n\r\ntrade  development  demonstrating the  importance  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  place  on  the development  of  the  external\r\n\r\nsectors of our economy.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his remarks on pump-priming, it is true\r\n\r\nthat during the recession we took advantage of the slack to\r\n\r\nstep up construction activities, This was aimed at speeding\r\n\r\nup the implementation of projects to provide Singapore with\r\n\r\nthe   infrastructure   to  enable   us   to   realise   the\r\n\r\nopportunities with economic recovery. In future, we may not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  keep up the same pace of construction  as  we\r\n\r\ncomplete our various development programmes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He next suggested that labour turnover should be monitored\r\n\r\nand  that the Central Provident Fund contribution is a good\r\n\r\nsource for labour statistics. I am pleased to say that  his\r\n\r\nsuggestion  to  use  CPF  data as  a  source  for  manpower\r\n\r\nstatistics  is already being adopted. Since 1974,  the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard has collaborated with my Ministry to develop a series\r\n\r\nof quarterly earnings and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nemployment statistics tabulated by age, sex and  sector  of\r\n\r\nactivity,  in order to keep tab of employment  and  earning\r\n\r\nchanges,  The  cost  of obtaining the statistics  has  been\r\n\r\nborne  by  the Government. CPF statistics have  been  found\r\n\r\nuseful   because   of   their   greater   timeliness    and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  coverage. In addition,  labour  turnover  is\r\n\r\nmonitored  based on data collected in the bi-annual  Labour\r\n\r\nTurnover Survey conducted by the Ministry of Labour.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the comments by the Member for Whampoa, He\r\n\r\npointed  out  the  need  to  examine  the  feasibility   of\r\n\r\ndeveloping  other  service industries in  addition  to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of manufacturing industries. I think the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Marine  Parade also spoke about warehousing  industry.\r\n\r\nBut  for  the  development of other service  industries.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to say that this has already been done. We  have\r\n\r\ncome  a  long  way  in developing our range  of  financial,\r\n\r\ncommunications and tourism services.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe there is good potential for Singapore to be\r\n\r\nfurther   developed  into  a  centre   for   regional   and\r\n\r\ninternational  warehousing  activities,  particularly   for\r\n\r\ncapital   goods   and   equipment,   The   Fiscal    Policy\r\n\r\nImplementation Committee will consider appropriate measures\r\n\r\nfor  this, Further efforts would also be made to expand the\r\n\r\nrange  of  our financial services, The forward  market  for\r\n\r\nforeign   exchange  will  be  developed  to  provide   more\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  trading  in  foreign  currencies.   Second\r\n\r\nmarkets  in  fixed  interest securities  and  Asian  Dollar\r\n\r\nNegotiable  Certificate of Deposits would also  be  further\r\n\r\nencouraged. High priority would continue to be accorded  to\r\n\r\nthe  promotion of tourism, our traditional foreign exchange\r\n\r\nearning sector. Greater attention will also be accorded  to\r\n\r\nthe promotion of convention business.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa also commented on the need for\r\n\r\ngreater efforts in export promotion. I fully agree with his\r\n\r\ncomments  that  our manufacturers should  approach  markets\r\n\r\nwith  a  view  to their long-term development  rather  than\r\n\r\nimmediate  sales. Some manufacturers have stayed away  from\r\n\r\nnew markets when their first\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncontacts  did not bring about immediate results. For  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  made sustained efforts, my Ministry has provided\r\n\r\nthe  necessary support. To supplement the assistance  given\r\n\r\nby  our  missions  in  overseas  capitals,  commercial  and\r\n\r\neconomic  secretaries have been posted to all  our  foreign\r\n\r\nmissions  in ASEAN countries. the United States, Japan  and\r\n\r\nGermany.  More  commercial secretaries  would  be  sent  to\r\n\r\ncommercially important cities, with priority being given to\r\n\r\nWest  Asia.  With  increased  ASEAN  economic  cooperation,\r\n\r\ngreater  efforts will be made to increase the diversity  of\r\n\r\nour  domestic  exports  to  the  region.  Export  promotion\r\n\r\nrequires  a joint effort by the private and public sectors,\r\n\r\nand  my  Ministry  will continue to work closely  with  the\r\n\r\ntrade  and  manufacturing  bodies  in  Singapore  on  trade\r\n\r\nmissions,  participation in international trade  fairs  and\r\n\r\nimprove  upon  other  services to help develop  our  export\r\n\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa has also spoken on the need to\r\n\r\nassist   the  expansion  and  diversification  of  existing\r\n\r\nindustries. I agree with this. A wide range of services has\r\n\r\nbeen   provided  to  assist.  We  have,  of   course.   the\r\n\r\nconcessionary  export  re-discount  facility  of  the   MAS\r\n\r\nintroduced  in  May  1975 and the Export  Credit  Insurance\r\n\r\nCorporation established in September 1976. The EDB has last\r\n\r\nyear  initiated the Capital Assistance Scheme. In  November\r\n\r\n1976,   the   Small  Industry  Finance  Scheme   was   also\r\n\r\nintroduced.  The  loans which we issued under  this  scheme\r\n\r\ncover   investments  in  new  plant  and   buildings.   new\r\n\r\nmachinery, hire purchase schemes and working capital. Loans\r\n\r\nranging  from 70% to 85% of the total investment cost  have\r\n\r\ngrace  periods  ranging from two to three  years,  and  are\r\n\r\nrepayable  within  four to ten years.  Interest  rates  are\r\n\r\nexpected  to  be  about 9.5%, around two percentage  points\r\n\r\nbelow commercial bank rates for such small companies.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think the Member for Whampoa commented on the\r\n\r\ntechnical  supporting  facilities for industry,  especially\r\n\r\nfor  calibrating equipment. The Government is aware of  the\r\n\r\nneeds   of   our   industries  for  appropriate   technical\r\n\r\nsupporting services.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nSpecifically, in SISIR, there are on-going programmes aimed\r\n\r\nat   developing  and  providing  calibration  services   to\r\n\r\nindustry,   in   electrical,  mechanical  and   temperature\r\n\r\napplications. The Government recognises that such  services\r\n\r\nrequire long gestation periods, and SISIR will continue  to\r\n\r\nreview  and upgrade regularly its technical programmes  and\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the Member for Sembawang who spoke on\r\n\r\nencouraging Singaporeans to buy more locally made products.\r\n\r\nI  am, of course, in full agreement with the Member's  call\r\n\r\nto  drop  their prejudice against local products.  For  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector, there is a standing order to all Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  and statutory boards to support  locally  made\r\n\r\nproducts,  particularly those approved by SISIR,  in  their\r\n\r\npurchases. But Government effort must be complemented by an\r\n\r\nequal  support from the private sector, I would, therefore,\r\n\r\nurge  CASE  and  local consumers to give  support  to  such\r\n\r\nlocally  manufactured quality products tested and  approved\r\n\r\nby SISIR.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to pass on to the various comments that\r\n\r\nhave  been made on manpower problems. The Member  for  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  commented  on  the training at  Government  training\r\n\r\ncentres  and the possible abuse of the name of training  by\r\n\r\nemployers giving inadequate training to the workers. He can\r\n\r\nbe assured that proper checks are being made to ensure that\r\n\r\nemployers   participating  in  the  Government's   training\r\n\r\nschemes  are giving the necessary skills to their trainees.\r\n\r\nThe 4-year Joint Industrial Training Programme organised by\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Development Board in conjunction with leading\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  employers is a planned programme  for  the\r\n\r\ntraining  of  precision skills. Trainees are registered  as\r\n\r\napprentices  with the Industrial Training Board  (ITB).  In\r\n\r\nthe first two years of training, the trainees follow a high\r\n\r\nstandard  training programme designed with  the  advice  of\r\n\r\nexpatriate  instructors who are well versed  in  industrial\r\n\r\ntraining methods and manpower requirements. In the last two\r\n\r\nyears, when trainees are placed with industry, the ITB  and\r\n\r\nEDB  training officers visit the factories at  least  once,\r\n\r\noften twice or\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  a year, to inspect the training log book and records.\r\n\r\nIn   addition,  they  check  the  training  jobs  and  hold\r\n\r\ndiscussions with supervisors and trainees.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon spoke on Communist infiltration in\r\n\r\ninstitutions  of higher learning being more  successful  if\r\n\r\nthere was great dissatisfaction , among student population.\r\n\r\nHe  suggested that to reduce this dissatisfaction  students\r\n\r\nshould   be  assured  of  employment  outlets.  While   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will try its best to ensure that there  are  as\r\n\r\nmany job opportunities as possible, I find it difficult  to\r\n\r\nagree with the Member's suggestion that graduates should be\r\n\r\nassured  of jobs after their graduation. It is  up  to  the\r\n\r\nperson concerned. I think. whether a university graduate, a\r\n\r\ntechnician  or  school leaver, to adjust  to  the  changing\r\n\r\nemployment  demands of the economy. Graduates  are  not  an\r\n\r\nexception  to this rule. and cannot expect, as a matter  of\r\n\r\nright.   cushy  and  high-paying  jobs  in  air-conditioned\r\n\r\noffices.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think the Member for Alexandra spoke of women\r\n\r\noften  stopping to work after marriage. He urged  the  need\r\n\r\nfor  more female participation. I would like to assure  him\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  is aware of the  need  to  encourage\r\n\r\ngreater   female   participation  in  the   labour   force,\r\n\r\nespecially when labour supply is getting tighter due to our\r\n\r\nsuccessful  family planning programmes. We  have  supported\r\n\r\nthe  running of creches and kindergartens and in  addition,\r\n\r\nworking  women  are permitted to opt for a  special  fiscal\r\n\r\nincentive, for example, for a separate assessment of  their\r\n\r\nincome  tax, and in respect of professional working  women,\r\n\r\nspecial   tax   allowances  for  their   children.   Female\r\n\r\nparticipation is also expected to rise as a result  of  our\r\n\r\neducation  policy. But in 1974, education  levels  of  non-working  women were still generally low. About 70% of  them\r\n\r\nhad  never attended school or had attended school  but  did\r\n\r\nnot  obtain any qualification. It is hoped that in time  to\r\n\r\ncome  we  will  have a new breed of female workers,  better\r\n\r\neducated than before.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be of interest to Members to learn that there has\r\n\r\nbeen an 8-point increase in the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncomposition  of the civil service in favour of females.  In\r\n\r\n1967, 37.1% of the civil service were women and it went  up\r\n\r\nthe following year to 37.2%. and again 33.1%, 34.3%, 36.9%,\r\n\r\n39.5%, 42.5%, 43.8% until in 1975 it was 45.1% so that  the\r\n\r\nmale proportion was 54.9%. I would not be surprised if  the\r\n\r\nratio were reversed in the coming years.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang suggested that the wage\r\n\r\ndifferentials  between professionals and  ordinary  workers\r\n\r\nshould  be  reduced so as to correct the sectoral shortages\r\n\r\nof  workers,  especially in the construction  industry  and\r\n\r\nreduce  the need to import foreign workers, I am unable  to\r\n\r\nagree with his suggestion for income redistribution.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a market economy like ours, wage differentials are\r\n\r\ndetermined   by  market  forces.  There  is   little   that\r\n\r\nGovernment   can  do  deliberately  to  narrow   the   wage\r\n\r\ndifferentials  without adversely affecting  efficiency  and\r\n\r\nincentives to work.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that completes the list of questions on the first\r\n\r\ncategory.  I now come to the second category of matters  on\r\n\r\nthe  civil service establishment, Budget and taxation.  The\r\n\r\nfirst comment was by the Member for Nee Soon who complained\r\n\r\nof  certain  civil servants holding directorships  and.  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  their promotion even though  they  have  shown\r\n\r\ninefficiency. I would like to say, first of all. that civil\r\n\r\nservants are appointed to boards of companies in which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  an  interest  not  because  they   deserve\r\n\r\npromotion  or  otherwise, Their duty  as  directors  is  to\r\n\r\nensure   that   the  companies  are  run  efficiently   and\r\n\r\nprofitably    and,   therefore,   that   the   Government's\r\n\r\ninvestments  are  safeguarded. These  civil  servants  very\r\n\r\noften assume responsibilities over and above those of their\r\n\r\ncivil service jobs proper.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan (Whampoa):</b> Sometimes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I said \"often\". I disagree there. Our\r\n\r\ncivil servants perhaps work probably harder and beyond  the\r\n\r\nnormal  eight-hour day. As the .Minister in charge  of  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Service. I am strongly of the opinion that at  least\r\n\r\nin the Division I Civil Service the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhours  worked are much more strenuous than those by  almost\r\n\r\nany other category of people. Certainly the amount of paper\r\n\r\nwork  has increased. Of course, whether Members regard this\r\n\r\nas   productive   is  another  matter.  As  regards   their\r\n\r\nefficiency,  the  performance of  these  functions  in  the\r\n\r\ncompanies,  as  the  Minister  in  charge  of  Government's\r\n\r\ninvestments  in  companies,  I  am  responsible   for   any\r\n\r\nassessment  that  may  be required. I  do  not,  therefore,\r\n\r\nunderstand  the Members' comment that there is  no  way  of\r\n\r\nassessing  them.  It  is, of course, not  the  business  of\r\n\r\neither   the  Public  Accounts  Committee  or  the   Budget\r\n\r\nCommittee to do this assessment whether the civil  servants\r\n\r\nare  accountable  to  the two Committees  or  not.  As  the\r\n\r\nMinister  in  charge  of investments, whether  overseas  or\r\n\r\nelsewhere, accordingly also responsible for the purchase of\r\n\r\nGranite  House,  I  do  not consider  that  the  Member  is\r\n\r\njustified in the derogatory remarks that he has made on the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  surrounding this purchase. The circumstances\r\n\r\nwere  fully  explained to the Public Accounts Committee  on\r\n\r\n25th February last year.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind the Member for Nee Soon also that the\r\n\r\nappointment and promotion of civil servants are matters for\r\n\r\nthe  Public Service Commission and that their promotion and\r\n\r\nreward  have, again, nothing to do with MPs.

The  Member  for  Anson  suggested   that\r\n\r\nGovernment  officers  be allowed a further  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexercise their options for conversion to the CPF scheme.  I\r\n\r\nshould  like to state that when this exercise was conducted\r\n\r\nfor Divisions Ill and IV in 1973. they were given one month\r\n\r\nto  make up their minds and also specifically told that the\r\n\r\noptions  were  irrevocable. The majority of officers  opted\r\n\r\nfor the CPF scheme. If we allow officers a second chance to\r\n\r\nopt  for the CPF scheme, likewise to be equitable. officers\r\n\r\nwho have opted for the CPF scheme would have to be given  a\r\n\r\nsecond  option  to revert to the Pension  scheme.  This  is\r\n\r\nclearly undesirable and goes\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagainst the basic principle of irrevocability of options.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also spoke. I think, on the use of CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions for purchase of flats. Like other members  of\r\n\r\nthe   public,  Government  officers  may  use   their   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  buy  flats  built  by  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board and the HUDC. Additionally, there  is  an\r\n\r\narrangement  whereby Government officers who are  confirmed\r\n\r\nin  their appointments can apply for loans from the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  to  purchase  Housing and  Development  Board  flats\r\n\r\nwithout the usual down payment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think the Member made an observation on senior\r\n\r\nofficers  being bypassed in promotions. I think by  \"senior\r\n\r\nofficer\"  he  means officers who are senior  by  age  being\r\n\r\nbypassed.  Of  course,  under  the  Government's  promotion\r\n\r\npolicy, seniority is taken into account, so also the  merit\r\n\r\nqualifications and experience of the candidates. Only those\r\n\r\nfound deserving on the basis of these factors are promoted.\r\n\r\nSeniority is only one of the factors for consideration.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, officers who have been longest in their jobs  ought\r\n\r\nto know better and be more efficient.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one suggestion which relates to the revision of\r\n\r\nthe Parliamentary Pensions Act. I think this was brought up\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Nee Soon. As this has been answered  by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister. I need not go into this other than  to\r\n\r\nsay that the Act provides for the award of a gratuity equal\r\n\r\nto  one  year's  salary  to the dependants  of  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament who die whilst in office. This is similar to the\r\n\r\npayment  of  a death gratuity to dependants of a Government\r\n\r\nofficer who dies while in service.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong spoke on the new budgetary system\r\n\r\nand  on  the need for good inter-personal relations between\r\n\r\nofficials  of my Ministry and those of other Ministries  so\r\n\r\nas  to  ensure  the successful implementation  of  the  new\r\n\r\nbudgetary system.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new budgetary system is targetted for implementation in\r\n\r\nthe financial year 1978.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nHon.  Members will be fully consulted and informed  through\r\n\r\nthe Estimates Committee of the changes contemplated in this\r\n\r\nnew   system.  The  new  budgetary  system  is  essentially\r\n\r\nperformance   oriented.   It   will   classify   Government\r\n\r\noperations,  work  and expenditure by objectives.  It  will\r\n\r\nalso provide greater flexibility to Ministries in the usage\r\n\r\nof  funds  so long as the objectives are realised and  cost\r\n\r\neffectiveness  is maintained or improved upon.  The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong  Kembangan has put down a  Question  for  oral\r\n\r\nanswer and Members who want more information on this system\r\n\r\ncan. refer to the answer I will be giving.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Member for Katong, I agree entirely\r\n\r\nthat  the success of the new budgetary system. as with  any\r\n\r\nsystem,  will  depend  to  a  very  large  extent  on   the\r\n\r\ncooperation  of the parties working it. There  have  always\r\n\r\nbeen  discussions  between officials  of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  and  those  of other Ministries  on  the  latter's\r\n\r\nbudget  requirements.  These discussions  have  given  both\r\n\r\nparties  a  better  appreciation of each other's  problems.\r\n\r\nHowever,  under  the new budgetary system, there  would  be\r\n\r\nmore  definite criteria, and accordingly there will be less\r\n\r\nsubjective  evaluation  and less  room  for  dispute  among\r\n\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to move on to the various comments on tax\r\n\r\nmatters.  I think the Member for Nee Soon desired  to  have\r\n\r\ngreater  debate on tax changes. I would like to  point  out\r\n\r\nthat  the last major tax changes were introduced in  1  968\r\n\r\nand were prompted by the need to raise revenue for building\r\n\r\nup  our  Armed  Forces. Since then,  there  have  been  few\r\n\r\nchanges in the tax structure. though we have found that  we\r\n\r\nhave imposed tax disincentives or given tax concessions.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increases have been made mainly to existing taxes on\r\n\r\nprivate  sector vehicles. cigarettes and tobacco  products,\r\n\r\nliquors  and  petroleum. These revisions were made  not  so\r\n\r\nmuch  to  raise additional revenue, though this  is  always\r\n\r\nwelcome,  as to alleviate traffic congestion and pollution,\r\n\r\nto   bolster  Government's  anti-smoking  campaign  and  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage consumption of non-essential\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nitems.  It is quite obvious that it would be impossible  to\r\n\r\nhave prior debate in Parliament on such tax increases since\r\n\r\nadvance notice of taxes would lead to hoarding, speculation\r\n\r\nand profiteering.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless. I wish to assure the House that where none\r\n\r\nof  these problems would arise from proposed changes to the\r\n\r\ntax structure, if for example, we should wish to change the\r\n\r\ntax  system from income taxation to value added tax as  has\r\n\r\nbeen  suggested by the Prime Minister yesterday. then  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers would be given every opportunity for debate on  the\r\n\r\nnew tax structure.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to a suggestion of the Member for Thomson on\r\n\r\nincome  tax  relief. I think the Member  for  Punggol  also\r\n\r\nsuggested  that the personal relief should be increased  in\r\n\r\nproportion  to  the increase in the cost  of  living  since\r\n\r\n1948.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir, I did\r\n\r\nnot refer to it this time.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> In that case, it would save me the burden\r\n\r\nof  answering this particular part of the question. Without\r\n\r\nreferring  to  specific  Members  of  Parliament,   several\r\n\r\nMembers have pressed for an upward revision in the personal\r\n\r\nallowances  for  income  tax. This  issue,  of  course,  is\r\n\r\nperennial  before each budget session, not only by  Members\r\n\r\nbut  also  by  the  press, At the risk of  boring  the  old\r\n\r\nincumbents  and  also  the  new Members,  may  I  take  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  repeat  once again  the  reasons  for  not\r\n\r\nIncreasing   these  allowances.  First,   any   significant\r\n\r\nincrease  in  personal relief would result in a substantial\r\n\r\nloss  in  revenue. A small increase of $1,000  in  personal\r\n\r\nrelief  would cause the Government to sacrifice $26 million\r\n\r\nin  revenue  a year. Our revenue performance  in  the  last\r\n\r\nfinancial  year and in the coming year is not so strong  as\r\n\r\nto  permit an increase in such income tax relief.  If  such\r\n\r\nrelief  were  to be increased, a new tax or an Increase  in\r\n\r\nother taxes may have to be imposed to make up for the  loss\r\n\r\nin revenue. Secondly, while the cost of living has gone up,\r\n\r\nso has the per capita income which Increases the ability of\r\n\r\nthe   taxpayer  to  pay  income  tax.  Thirdly,  the  ever-increasing\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npublic expenditure has to be borne by as many people as can\r\n\r\nbear them. It is salutary for them to be reminded that  the\r\n\r\nservices provided by Government must be paid for,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the Member for Kallang. He said that \"the\r\n\r\npresent  income tax rates are not conducive  to  attracting\r\n\r\ninternational  operations that  neither  buy  nor  sell  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"  He welcomed the establishment  of  the  Fiscal\r\n\r\nPolicy  Implementation Committee to consider how  best  the\r\n\r\ntax  system cap be adjusted. He also suggested that as  tax\r\n\r\ncollectors are \"notoriously conservative when it  comes  to\r\n\r\ntax  incentives, those who are directly in  charge  of  tax\r\n\r\ncollections  should have little to do with the  formulation\r\n\r\nof  tax  incentives.\" I think the Government is aware  that\r\n\r\nthe  present  tax rates are not sufficiently attractive  to\r\n\r\ninduce  the  growth  of  off-shore  trading  activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and certain proposed tax concessions for business\r\n\r\nengaged in offshore trading are now being examined  by  the\r\n\r\nFiscal   Policy  Implementation  Committee.   The   primary\r\n\r\nfunction  of  the  Committee is to study how  to  implement\r\n\r\nmajor  tax  changes which have already been  decided  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of policy by the Government. The tax administrators\r\n\r\nare included in the Committee to render technical advice on\r\n\r\nhow the new tax incentives can be implemented smoothly.  In\r\n\r\nany  case  if there is any difficulty, I think any conflict\r\n\r\nshould be resolved by the Minister for Finance who is  both\r\n\r\nresponsible   for  development  of  international   trading\r\n\r\ncentres  as  well as restrictions which the  Budget  impose\r\n\r\nupon other tax policies.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I come to the problem of oil companies and the\r\n\r\nadjustments  to the retail price of petrol. There  is  also\r\n\r\nanother example quoted by the Member for Moulmein about the\r\n\r\ntax  surcharge which properly is a matter for the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Finance, On the unhappiness over the so-called increases\r\n\r\nof  taxes in the form of additional duty on petrol, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  inform Members that adjustments to the  price  of\r\n\r\npetroleum  products inclusive of adjustments in duties  are\r\n\r\nrelated  to  price  increases of  crude  supplied  by  OPEC\r\n\r\ncountries.  The  overall increase allowed is  spread  among\r\n\r\nmajor\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprice-controlled items so as. to favour industry and public\r\n\r\ntransportation. This is in line with Government  policy  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  ownership of private motor vehicles.  Consumers\r\n\r\nas  a whole group do not face any additional cost over  and\r\n\r\nabove  what  is  necessary to compensate for  increases  in\r\n\r\ncrude  prices.  The  duty  of 1  .8  cents  per  litre  for\r\n\r\nautomotive  diesel oil was, for instance.  removed  in  the\r\n\r\nJanuary 1976 round of price increases.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the tax on PUB bills, this was first introduced in\r\n\r\nJanuary  1969  with  legislation of  the  Statutory  Boards\r\n\r\n(Taxable  Services)  Act. The tax was  intended  mainly  to\r\n\r\ndefray  increased defence expenditure. The majority of  the\r\n\r\npeople  are  not really penalised by the surcharge  on  PUB\r\n\r\nbills.  On each occasion that the PUB was obliged to  raise\r\n\r\neither  its electricity or water tariffs, the tax structure\r\n\r\nwas  also revised accordingly to give relief to the smaller\r\n\r\ndomestic  consumers.  When the tax  was  first  imposed  in\r\n\r\nJanuary 1969, households whose bills were in excess of  $10\r\n\r\nper  month  were liable to pay tax. The cut-off  point  has\r\n\r\nsince  been revised on four occasions and is now pegged  at\r\n\r\n$35  per  month. However, we are reviewing  it  once  again\r\n\r\nsince we shall have to consider it in conjunction with what\r\n\r\nincrease  we must allow in electricity tariffs  because  of\r\n\r\nincreased oil prices.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I repeat what my colleague, the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment and Communications, has stated? On the  average\r\n\r\nsome 70.5% of the total domestic households in Singapore do\r\n\r\nnot  pay  Government tax on their PUB bills as their  bills\r\n\r\nare  less than $35 a month. In addition a further 14.5% pay\r\n\r\ntax  and only at 5%; and the remaining 1 5% pay at the  10%\r\n\r\ntax  rate.  As  for the latter category of households,  the\r\n\r\nimposition of Government tax should induce them to be  more\r\n\r\neconomical  with  regard to consumption of public  utility.\r\n\r\nWith  regard  to  the industries, the larger  consumers  of\r\n\r\nelectricity have been granted exemption from the tax.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not want\r\n\r\nto  interrupt while the Minister was speaking.

For example, when he referred  to\r\n\r\nthe  various  schemes of Government like Export  Financing,\r\n\r\nCapital   Assistance  Scheme,  Small  Industries  Financing\r\n\r\nScheme,  and  so on. he gave us no details  of  the  actual\r\n\r\nimplementation, that is, what has actually  been  achieved,\r\n\r\nwhat  is the cost involved, and what is the number of firms\r\n\r\ninvolved.  He  merely  gave  us  a  regurgitation  of   the\r\n\r\nprinciples of those schemes. Similarly, when he referred to\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Training Scheme. he talked in  general  terms,\r\n\r\ndescribing  what those schemes are but without  telling  us\r\n\r\nthe number involved and no reference to cost effectiveness.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is when he referred to the percentage of\r\n\r\nwomen  in  the  civil  service and pointed  out  to  an  8%\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of women, but he did not tell us  in\r\n\r\nwhat categories those women are in. If they all joined  the\r\n\r\nService  as  sweepers  and cleaners,  we  can,  of  course,\r\n\r\nenlarge the number ad infinitum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point he referred to was in regard to wage\r\n\r\ndifferentials   and  said  that  there  was   little   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could do. That is not true because  Government\r\n\r\npolicy  substantially  affects  demand  and  supply.

W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, there are advantages of being the last speaker on the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side  but  there are  also  its  disadvantages,\r\n\r\nespecially after yesterday's marathon performance. Most  of\r\n\r\nthe points, in fact, have been covered by others and by the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister himself. I would like briefly to deal  with\r\n\r\none or two points.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested by one Member that the Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment  does  not  work very hard  against  hawkers  in\r\n\r\nconstituencies where Ministers have been elected  but  they\r\n\r\nwork  especially  hard where Members are. After  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  speech yesterday, I think the  Member  will  be\r\n\r\nwell  aware that if I did that I would not only be  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of the Environment but also out of the House.\r\n\r\nBut  let  us  assume that that is true, so if  he  wants  a\r\n\r\nhawker's  licence he comes to Tanglin. Let us take  it  one\r\n\r\nstep  further. If he wants a Housing Board flat,  he  tries\r\n\r\nCairnhill. If he wants a ticket to the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfootball  stadium, he goes to River Valley. If he wants  to\r\n\r\nsmoke  ganja, try MacPherson. If he does not  want  to  pay\r\n\r\nincome tax or wants a postponement, go to Havelock,  If  he\r\n\r\nwants  his  son to be exempted from national  service,  try\r\n\r\nKreta  Ayer. Gentlemen, if he wants all these things rolled\r\n\r\ninto one, he knows where to go - Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just one more point on the Ministry of Law. It is about\r\n\r\nthe procedure in respect of urgent bills, which was touched\r\n\r\nupon  by  one  Member  and defended by the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nyesterday.  The  Prime Minister cited some figures.  I  can\r\n\r\ngive  much  more.  It is under Standing  Order  82  that  a\r\n\r\nCertificate  of  Urgency is required to be  signed  by  the\r\n\r\nPresident before a Bill can be taken through all stages  in\r\n\r\nthis House at one go. All Ministries are fully aware of the\r\n\r\nneed  to  let  bills go through their normal process,  thus\r\n\r\nensuring the full benefit of Parliamentary scrutiny  before\r\n\r\nthe  final form emerges. In fact, in recent years, very few\r\n\r\nbills have been taken through on a Certificate of Urgency.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last six years from 1971 to 1976, Parliament dealt\r\n\r\nwith  219  bills. Of these, only seven were  taken  through\r\n\r\nurgently. In the last three years. 1974 to 1976, out of 107\r\n\r\nActs  of  Parliament, only three (one in  each  year)  were\r\n\r\ndealt  with  as urgent bills. They were: the  Criminal  Law\r\n\r\n(Temporary  Provisions) (Amendment) Bill,  1974.  This  was\r\n\r\ntaken  through to extend the life of the Act which was  due\r\n\r\nto  expire.  In 1975, the Companies (Amendment) Bill.  This\r\n\r\nwas an amendment to enable an inspector appointed under the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act to inform the Minister of any matters  coming\r\n\r\nto  his  knowledge as a result of the investigation tending\r\n\r\nto  show that an offence has been committed. This piece  of\r\n\r\nurgent legislation arose Out of the investigations into the\r\n\r\nHaw   Par   affair.  Last  year  the  Financial   Procedure\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill was taken through urgently in view of  the\r\n\r\nimpending  prorogation of Parliament after the  sitting  on\r\n\r\n24th  November last year prior to the elections. There have\r\n\r\nbeen,  as  far  as  I am aware, no. bills which  have  been\r\n\r\namended\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npurely  because  of  drafting  errors.  Bills  are  amended\r\n\r\nprimarily  because  in  the  light  of  working  experience\r\n\r\ninadequacies  are revealed. Administrators and  enforcement\r\n\r\nofficers may come up against situations not envisaged  when\r\n\r\nthe   bill  was  first  drafted  or  the  test  of   actual\r\n\r\nenforcement   may   reveal  loopholes   which   necessitate\r\n\r\nplugging.  Of  course,  when such a  situation  arises  the\r\n\r\nopportunity is taken by the draftsman to make any desirable\r\n\r\ndrafting  changes  which  might  make  the  language,  more\r\n\r\nexplicit  or remove doubts which might have arisen  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime  consequent on prosecution, litigation or judicial\r\n\r\nreview.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the point made by the Member for Nee Soon\r\n\r\nabout the difficulty in understanding legislation, this  is\r\n\r\nunderstandable as even those trained in the  law  sometimes\r\n\r\nhave difficulty in interpreting provisions, couched as they\r\n\r\nare,  in legal terminology. It is for this reason that  all\r\n\r\nbills  have  attached to them explanatory statements  which\r\n\r\ntry  and set out in lay language the main provisions of the\r\n\r\nbill.  However,  the  general point,  made  by  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  touching  on  this  subject  that  legislation,\r\n\r\nhastily   conceived  or  pressed  for  by   administrators,\r\n\r\nenforcement agencies, revenue and tax collectors and  those\r\n\r\nprimarily  interested in getting results  rather  than  the\r\n\r\nmeans or mode of getting such results, is a valid one. This\r\n\r\nis  particularly  so where objectives can  be  achieved  by\r\n\r\nbetter  administration or education  or  a  combination  of\r\n\r\nboth.  This  debate has underlined the need  to  constantly\r\n\r\nstress to all concerned that in the realm of legislation it\r\n\r\nis wise to make haste slowly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before this debate began I invited Members to speak\r\n\r\nfreely and openly. They have done so. I congratulate  them.\r\n\r\nBut  in  this debate, Members and Parliamentary Secretaries\r\n\r\nspoke first. Ministers had' the advantage of replying.  And\r\n\r\nI have the advantage of speaking last. I am not against the\r\n\r\ncut  and  thrust  of  debate. This is the  essence  of  any\r\n\r\nParliament.

Their satisfaction with  Government's\r\n\r\npolicies  as well as their dissatisfaction have  both  been\r\n\r\nvoiced  in this House. The Leader of the House has referred\r\n\r\nto  the cut and thrust of debate, particularly in the  last\r\n\r\nthree  days. It is my impression, which he confirmed,  that\r\n\r\nmore  thrusts  were proferred by the Ministers  while  more\r\n\r\ncuts were sustained by the Backbenchers!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to make only three observations: First, the\r\n\r\nlarge  number of comments. including complaints, about  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board is surely an index  of  its\r\n\r\nsuccess.  If  only  5% instead of 50% of  our  people  were\r\n\r\nliving  in HDB flats, we would have had far fewer reference\r\n\r\nto  the problems that the HDB generates. Backbenchers, many\r\n\r\nof whom would not have been from the PAP, in reflecting the\r\n\r\nneeds  of their constituents. would have been demanding  in\r\n\r\nthis House that the Government build more flats rather than\r\n\r\nbetter  quality  flats. This is not to  say  there  are  no\r\n\r\nproblems at all. I have my fair share of dealings with  the\r\n\r\nHDB.  I have not always succeeded in meeting the wishes  of\r\n\r\nmy  HDB  constituents. But I have always received  courtesy\r\n\r\nand  cooperation. And I think that most Members would  have\r\n\r\nhad the same experience.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second observation relates to comments and complaints\r\n\r\nabout  the civil service. I would feel sorry for the  civil\r\n\r\nservants  except  for the fact that they  are  particularly\r\n\r\nable  to take care of themselves. Furthermore, they have  a\r\n\r\nstout  defender  in the Minister for Finances  I  am  truly\r\n\r\nastonished  to  learn that he can and does give  them  hell\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to  time.  However, if a bureaucrat  takes  the\r\n\r\ninitiative, he runs the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrisk  of  being accused of usurping the supremacy  or\r\n\r\nsovereignty  of Parliament. But strict  adherence  to\r\n\r\nhis  Instruction  Manual does not  provide  him  with\r\n\r\nsafety either: he can be accused of being inflexible.\r\n\r\nunimaginative, even inhuman.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Members in this House are ex-civil\r\n\r\nservants.  They range from Ministers to  rat-catchers\r\n\r\nto Backbenchers. Have we here a Mr Hyde and Dr Jekyll\r\n\r\ntransformation?  Do  inflexible,  unimaginative   and\r\n\r\ninhuman  bureaucrats  become enterprising,  sensitive\r\n\r\nand  warm politicians? Should we try to run our civil\r\n\r\nservants through this House to sensitize them? If our\r\n\r\nex-civil  servant Members were already  sensitive  in\r\n\r\nthe  first  place,  should we have  allowed  them  to\r\n\r\nremain in the civil service? That also does not  seem\r\n\r\nlike  a  practical  solution. I  believe  that  civil\r\n\r\nservants  who  forget to be civil,  who  forget  that\r\n\r\ntheir duty is to serve the public, should be reported\r\n\r\nand  if found to be at fault, appropriately punished.\r\n\r\nThe machinery to do this exists, and should be used.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third observation I want to make is about\r\n\r\nnational security, which occupied a good part of  the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Address and which engaged the  attention\r\n\r\nof many Members, During our debate the confessions of\r\n\r\nG, Raman appeared and several arrests were made. They\r\n\r\nreveal  to us the ever-present threat to our national\r\n\r\nsecurity, The communist danger is not a bogey. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  figment of a fertile imagination. In  other\r\n\r\ncountries  communists have attempted to  or  actually\r\n\r\nsucceeded in seizing power. Two of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nour  ASEAN  neighbours  have  recently  mounted  more\r\n\r\nintensive  operations to meet the  escalating  danger\r\n\r\nfrom   the   communists.  We  in   Singapore   cannot\r\n\r\nreasonably expect to be left unmolested, seeing  that\r\n\r\nthe   Communist   Party  of  Malaya   (CPM)   regards\r\n\r\nPeninsular  Malaysia and Singapore  as  one.  namely,\r\n\r\nMalaya.   Subversion,  communist  as  well  as   non-communist,  is one of the facts of life. But  we  can\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  overcome all attempts  to  subvert  us.\r\n\r\nprovided we remain \"vigilant and discriminating\"  and\r\n\r\nprovided   the   PAP  continues   to   govern   \"with\r\n\r\ncircumspection and moderation\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion\r\n\r\nstanding in my name.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put. and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the President be agreed to:--\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore, express our thanks to the President for\r\n\r\nthe Speech which he delivered on behalf of the Government at the opening of the First\r\n\r\nSession of this Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to Monday, 28th February, 1977.\" - [Mr. E.
