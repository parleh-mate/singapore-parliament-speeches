I\r\n\r\nwish to assure Members of this House that MCD works closely with\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  grassroots  organisations  in  planning   social\r\n\r\nservices  in HDB estates, including the BASCs.  While  MCD  does\r\n\r\nthe   overall   planning  to  ensure  a  good  distribution   of\r\n\r\nfacilities, grassroots leaders and the CDCs are briefed  on  its\r\n\r\nsocial services development\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmaster  plan to share with them the planning considerations  and\r\n\r\ncriteria,  the  location  of these social  services  and  obtain\r\n\r\nfeedback to refine our planning process.  We can fine-tune  this\r\n\r\nprocess further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the Member's comment that a number of BASCs\r\n\r\nhave closed down.  To-date, we know that three BASCs have closed\r\n\r\ndown, out of about 200 BASCs in Singapore.  Two were due to poor\r\n\r\ndemand  and  the other was affected by upgrading  works.   BASCs\r\n\r\nare,  like  other facilities, developed through the  process  of\r\n\r\nconsultation  which I mentioned earlier.  While  the  number  of\r\n\r\nBASCs  to  be developed is centrally planned, MCD works  closely\r\n\r\nwith theVWOs and grassroots organisations and advisors concerned\r\n\r\nwhen determining their location.  BASCs run by private operators\r\n\r\nor  those by VWOs that do not require Government funding, do not\r\n\r\nrequire any prior endorsement by my Ministry. In such cases, the\r\n\r\ndecisions are made by the organisations concerned based on their\r\n\r\ncommercial  consideration.   They make  their  own  choices  and\r\n\r\ndecisions and therefore they may have to close if they get their\r\n\r\nsums wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Mr Sin Boon Ann's amendment. There are\r\n\r\n54  voluntary  welfare organisations supported by the  Community\r\n\r\nChest.   MOH,  MCD  and  the Ministry  of  Education  also  fund\r\n\r\nvoluntary    welfare   organisations.    Programmes    of    the\r\n\r\norganisations that receive public funds are assessed  vigorously\r\n\r\nbefore they are funded to ensure viability and efficient use  of\r\n\r\nresources.   All public funds and donations are  audited.   VWOs\r\n\r\nare also registered under the Societies Act or with the Registry\r\n\r\nof  Companies and Businesses, which require them to keep  proper\r\n\r\naccounts  and  records of their income and  expenditure.   Their\r\n\r\naccounts  are audited and submitted to the relevant  authorities\r\n\r\nand  donors  can see these accounts which are also published  in\r\n\r\ntheir  annual reports.  Organisations that raise money  directly\r\n\r\nfrom  the  public  are  required to apply  to,  and  follow  the\r\n\r\nguidelines  on fund-raising drawn up by, the Licensing  Unit  of\r\n\r\nCID, the Registry of Societies and the Inland Revenue\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAuthority of Singapore.  These are adequate and MCD need not add\r\n\r\nto the bureaucracy.  Nevertheless, we will monitor the situation\r\n\r\nand put in place measures to improve the situation, if needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon. I share the\r\n\r\nconcerns  of the hon. Member on the importance of family  values\r\n\r\nand  social cohesion.  She has stated her case passionately  and\r\n\r\ncomprehensively.  I think I have addressed her concerns  on  the\r\n\r\nneed   to  strengthen  family  ties  and  values  in  my  speech\r\n\r\nyesterday.   With  increasing  and competing  pressures  on  the\r\n\r\nfamily,  the  inculcation of family values is  crucial  for  the\r\n\r\npreservation  of the family as the basic building block  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.   We have Dr Ngiam Tee Liang from the NUS  to  chair  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  to promote Singapore's family values.   It  works  in\r\n\r\nclose  collaboration with social service agencies, civic groups,\r\n\r\nschools, the private sector and the unions.  Dr Ngiam is also  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the Committee on the Family chaired by Mr Noel  Hon,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  being  appointed this month, to look  into  strategic\r\n\r\nissues affecting the well-being of the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to questions from Dr Lily Neo and Mr Ang Mong\r\n\r\nSeng. I will take the questions by both Members together.   They\r\n\r\nasked  on  MCD's  strategy to prepare for an  aging  population,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have already informed the House in broad terms  in  my\r\n\r\nopening  speech yesterday.  I would like to thank  both  Members\r\n\r\nfor sharing their comments, especially to Dr Neo for sharing her\r\n\r\nvision  on  elder  care.   We want our  senior  citizens  to  be\r\n\r\nhealthy, active and secure.  We must formulate the right elderly\r\n\r\npolicies, develop elderly friendly infrastructure and change the\r\n\r\nmindset   of  the  elderly  as  well  as  that  of  the  younger\r\n\r\nSingaporeans towards the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key strategy of MCD is therefore to strengthen public\r\n\r\neducation  programmes on aging.  We want Singaporeans  to  value\r\n\r\nthe elderly as a resource and to see growing older as a time for\r\n\r\nfurther  development,  learning and continuing  contribution  to\r\n\r\nsociety.   I  agree  with Dr Neo's point that  building  a  home\r\n\r\nenvironment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat is safe and elderly friendly should be encouraged.  Mr  Ang\r\n\r\nMong Seng has also noted that not all senior citizens can afford\r\n\r\nstudio  apartments.  The IMC's review of housing for the elderly\r\n\r\nwill address concerns of both Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members might like to know that MCD and HDB started a\r\n\r\nnumber of projects to provide elderly friendly features in  one-room  rental  apartment  blocks for  the  elderly.   The  Senior\r\n\r\nActivity  Centres  in  these projects provide  services  to  the\r\n\r\nelderly and serve as focal points for mutual help.  They are run\r\n\r\nby  VWOs  and  are  very much like the Centre  of  Activity  for\r\n\r\nRetired  Elderly  (CARE) that Dr Lily Neo mentioned.   MCD  will\r\n\r\nlook into how our present concept of Senior Activity Centres can\r\n\r\nbe  improved  or even expanded to better meet the needs  of  the\r\n\r\nwell  elderly.   MCD  will ensure a coordinated  effort  amongst\r\n\r\nvoluntary  care  groups  in  the delivery  of  services.   Three\r\n\r\nregional  Community  Care  Networks  and  a  National  Geriatric\r\n\r\nCoordinating  Committee,  spearheaded  by  the  NCSS   and   MOH\r\n\r\nrespectively, are working towards a network of comprehensive and\r\n\r\ncoordinated  services at the local level, as well  as  to  share\r\n\r\nbest practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested that the Elderly Development\r\n\r\nDivision  of my Ministry should work closely with the grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  in implementing services and programmes  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly  which are practical and close to the ground.   I  share\r\n\r\nhis view. The Division will indeed work closely with PA and CDCs\r\n\r\nto  explore how the grassroots organisations can play  a  bigger\r\n\r\nrole  in these areas.  I agree with Mr Ang's comment on the need\r\n\r\nto  reskill older workers in order to keep up with the  pace  of\r\n\r\ntechnological change.  We will have to look into this issue more\r\n\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of elderly abuse which was raised by Dr Neo\r\n\r\nyesterday,  I  wish to assure the Member that the Ministry  does\r\n\r\nnot condone all forms of family violence, including abuse of the\r\n\r\nelderly.  Legislative and non-legislative measures have been put\r\n\r\nin  place to manage and curb family violence and we will monitor\r\n\r\nthe situation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand will continue to improve on these measures, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Women's Charter in 1996 both enhanced\r\n\r\nand  extended protection to elderly victims of family  violence.\r\n\r\nWe  also  implemented a national networking system for  managing\r\n\r\nfamily  violence on 1st July 1996.  This system is a coordinated\r\n\r\nmulti-disciplinary  approach  for  the  management   of   family\r\n\r\nviolence  cases  involving the MCD, the Police,  hospitals,  the\r\n\r\nFamily  Court, social service agencies and the crisis  shelters.\r\n\r\nAny  victim  who seeks assistance will be informed  of  all  the\r\n\r\nother  services available to him or her.  And he or she will  be\r\n\r\nadvised  on how to receive protection, counselling and  shelter.\r\n\r\nPublic education materials have been distributed to polyclinics,\r\n\r\nhospitals,  NPPs,  FSCs  and other social  service  agencies  to\r\n\r\nincrease awareness of family violence and to inform them of what\r\n\r\nthey can do about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of elderly abuse is complex. There are\r\n\r\ncases  where children may not intentionally abuse their  parents\r\n\r\nbut  neglect their basic needs.  Many families may also not know\r\n\r\nhow  to  cope  with the elderly who are suffering  from  medical\r\n\r\nproblems  such  as  senile dementia.  My Ministry  produced  two\r\n\r\nvideo tapes on elderly care entitled \"Caring by Elderly Spouses\"\r\n\r\n-    this  was  last  year   -   and  \"Caring  by  the  Sandwich\r\n\r\nGeneration\"  also produced last year.  Certainly,  more  can  be\r\n\r\ndone to support and educate care givers on the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will develop a protocol on the reporting and\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  elder  abuse this year.  This  project  is  also\r\n\r\nintended  to  educate  the general public and  persons  who  are\r\n\r\nlikely to come into frequent contact with elderly persons on how\r\n\r\nto identify signs of elder abuse and to help such abused persons\r\n\r\nobtain assistance and protection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the amendment by Dr Ho Tat Kin asking for\r\n\r\nfurther developments on the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC)\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  the  aging  population.  In my statement  yesterday,  I  had\r\n\r\nbriefly touched on the role of the IMC on the aged.  The IMC has\r\n\r\nbeen   meeting  monthly.   It  has  been  briefed   by   various\r\n\r\nMinistries,  statutory boards, non-Government organisations  and\r\n\r\nthe  voluntary  welfare organisations as  well,  to  familiarise\r\n\r\nitself   with  the  various  policies,  programmes  and   issues\r\n\r\nassociated with an aging population.  Work groups are now  being\r\n\r\nformed  to  conduct  in-depth reviews in the  various  areas  of\r\n\r\nconcern,  eg,  employment,  employability,  financial  security,\r\n\r\nhousing and social integration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Ho that we must encourage the habit and\r\n\r\ncreate  opportunities  for continuing  education  and  life-long\r\n\r\nlearning  for older Singaporeans.  This is key to employability,\r\n\r\nfinancial  security  as  well as personal  enrichment  in  later\r\n\r\nyears.   He  suggested  setting up a  dedicated  university  for\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens.  Presently, senior citizens who wish to pursue\r\n\r\nhigher  education already have the opportunity to do so at  some\r\n\r\nexisting  institutions  of higher learning,  such  as  our  Open\r\n\r\nUniversity.   One  way  is  for the  university  to  tailor  its\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  meet the needs and aspirations of older  people.\r\n\r\nIn  any  case,  I will pass on this suggestion  to  the  IMC  to\r\n\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Parliamentary Secretary will now reply to two\r\n\r\nquestions related to the People's Association.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  (Mr Chan Soo Sen): Sir, on behalf of  my  Minister,\r\n\r\nallow  me  to  address  two  of the amendments  related  to  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association.  One is by Mr Low Thia Khiang on voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations and social workers, and the other  is  by  Mr  Ang\r\n\r\nMong  Seng  on  community bonding.  Since both  amendments  were\r\n\r\nraised in Mandarin, allow me to reply in Mandarin as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin):\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng said that grassroots organisations have\r\n\r\nmade  great  efforts in uniting our nation, and have contributed\r\n\r\ngreatly  to  our  nation building and national unity.   I  fully\r\n\r\nagree with him.  Mr Ang has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso  mooted the idea of a \"Unity Circle\".  The 12  Cs  that  he\r\n\r\nmentioned  yesterday are actually related to  unity  cycle.   We\r\n\r\nlook  forward to hearing more specific recommendations from  him\r\n\r\non how to put this idea into practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suggested that there should be National Day Observance\r\n\r\nceremonies at every community club or community centre.  I agree\r\n\r\nwith  him  and  I  will  urge all the  CCs  to  take  this  into\r\n\r\nconsideration.  He has also recommended that at the National Day\r\n\r\nParade, we should have some display of our defence facilities to\r\n\r\nshow  our people our defence readiness. The People's Association\r\n\r\nwill  bring  up  this  matter   with  the  National  Day  Parade\r\n\r\nCommittee for its consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang mentioned that the voluntary social\r\n\r\nworkers  are  not enjoying due recognition in our  society,  and\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  no status.  He commented  that our  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations have a lot of benefits, and he asked whether these\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations enjoy all these benefits because  they\r\n\r\nare actually serving the PAP, and not the community. .\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about the last point that he raised. In fact,\r\n\r\nthis is not the first time that he has brought up the matter.  I\r\n\r\nmust  reiterate  that  the  grassroots organisations  serve  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  and not the PAP.  In fact, we make it  a  point  that\r\n\r\nactivities of the PAP  are kept clearly distinct from  community\r\n\r\nactivities.   For example, the PAP is not allowed to  carry  out\r\n\r\nany  activities in the community centres, because the  community\r\n\r\ncentres  are run by community organisations.  If he  feels  that\r\n\r\nthe  grassroots  leaders are getting the benefits  because  they\r\n\r\nserve  the  PAP, he is wrong. As Mr Ang Mong Seng has said,  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations have contributed greatly in uniting our\r\n\r\nnation and in enhancing our social cohesiveness.  Over the  past\r\n\r\n30  years, they have observed the main objectives of uniting our\r\n\r\nnation  and   enhancing  cohesiveness  among  our  people.   Our\r\n\r\nsociety  has undergone great changes in the past 30 years.   The\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations are able to adjust themselves  and  to\r\n\r\ncontinue being relevant to our nation.  Therefore, we feel  that\r\n\r\nthe grassroots organisations\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeserve the rewards or recognition that they are getting  today.\r\n\r\nIn  some  grassroots organisations, the volunteer  workers  have\r\n\r\ndedicated the best time of their lives to community service.   I\r\n\r\nthink this is indeed very praiseworthy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang also mentioned that our voluntary social\r\n\r\nworkers need to be given better rewards and recognition  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety,  and  he is concerned about the welfare of  the  social\r\n\r\nworkers.  I fully agree with him on this point. I think  all  of\r\n\r\nus  in  this House will also agree with him on this.  Yesterday,\r\n\r\nmy  Minister  mentioned that MCD will set up  an  inter-Ministry\r\n\r\nagency  to facilitate volunteerism.   One of the main objectives\r\n\r\nof this agency is to do a comprehensive overall review on how to\r\n\r\nprovide  better  rewards and  recognition  for  these  voluntary\r\n\r\nsocial  workers.  If anyone has any suggestion,  please  let  me\r\n\r\nknow  and I will commit it to this agency for consideration.   I\r\n\r\nthink we should also attach more importance to volunteerism.   I\r\n\r\nhope that by the 21st century we will have more volunteer social\r\n\r\nworkers coming forward to serve our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, a\r\n\r\nclarification  from  the Parliamentary  Secretary.   When  doing\r\n\r\nvoluntary  work,  sometimes our VWOs exceed the  time  of  their\r\n\r\nparking coupons and they were summoned for that.  Why can we not\r\n\r\nprovide  VWOs who drive the convenience of free parking  in  our\r\n\r\nHDB or URA car parks?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Parliamentary Secretary said that the work of\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  and  the grassroots organisations is not  related.   I\r\n\r\nwould like him to state categorically how do the PAP workers and\r\n\r\nthe   grassroots  workers  disassociate  themselves  during  the\r\n\r\ngeneral elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, regarding the parking\r\n\r\nproblem, as I have said just now, we can let the proposed agency\r\n\r\nlook into it.  Not all volunteer workers drive. So we will   see\r\n\r\nwhether   something can be done about it.  Let the  agency  look\r\n\r\ninto the matter and see what is the outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the general elections, grassroots organisations do\r\n\r\nnot   participate  in  PAP's  election  work.   If   they   have\r\n\r\nparticipated, that is because they themselves are  PAP  members.\r\n\r\nWe  do  not  deny  that  there are some  members  of  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations who are PAP members.  If they help the PAP in  the\r\n\r\nelection  work,  they  are  working in  their  capacity  as  PAP\r\n\r\nmembers.   They  are not helping the PAP in  their  capacity  as\r\n\r\ngrassroots workers.  There is no association in the first place,\r\n\r\nso, therefore there is no question of dissociation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would like to speak on\r\n\r\nthe  need  for a review of public assistance rates.  I have  two\r\n\r\nissues of concern to raise.  First, public assistance rates  for\r\n\r\nthe poor have not been revised for the past few years.  The cost\r\n\r\nof  living has been very tight for the unsupported poor.   Their\r\n\r\nsource  of  assistance has thinned out, because of  the  current\r\n\r\neconomic   problems.   There  are  less  people  providing   the\r\n\r\nnecessary support.  In the light of this, there is a need to see\r\n\r\nwhat  the Ministry of Community Development would be able to  do\r\n\r\nin revising the public assistance rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue that I would like to raise is a more\r\n\r\npressing problem.  This is in connection with the unskilled  and\r\n\r\nunsupported  retrenched workers.  There are quite  a  number  of\r\n\r\nthem that I have been noticing this trend in the meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsessions  and other community organisations.  I feel  that  this\r\n\r\ngroup, for the first time, have run into difficulties.  For many\r\n\r\nyears since the last recession or even close to the 1950s,  this\r\n\r\nphenomenon has not come about.  The problems of older, unskilled\r\n\r\nretrenched workers probably need closer attention, because  many\r\n\r\nof  them have families.  Some of them are in their late 40s  and\r\n\r\nbelow  50, who have found great difficulty in getting employment\r\n\r\nover  a period.  Because, in the first place, they are unskilled\r\n\r\nand  that  many of the companies that they are working with  are\r\n\r\nrelocating to other economies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the short term, there is a need for PA rules to be\r\n\r\nmade flexible to provide temporary financial assistance for this\r\n\r\ngroup  of  retrenched older workers.  Would MCD be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nlook  into helping these unemployed retrenched workers and their\r\n\r\nfamilies?  Perhaps may I suggest that a social support  fund  be\r\n\r\nmade  available to provide temporary assistance to  them  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of time so that they would be able to get through  their\r\n\r\ndifficulties  until  they  find alternative  employment  through\r\n\r\nfurther training.  This would be one solution to a problem  like\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a longer term measure, this issue is likely to\r\n\r\nrecur  when we run into another economic problem in future.   It\r\n\r\nis  therefore  necessary for MCD, the Ministry of  Manpower  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  Employers' Federation to work out a scheme to  follow\r\n\r\nthrough   retrenched  workers,  particularly  older   retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers,  who  are unlikely to find employment,  or  would  have\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in finding employment.  This group of  people  would\r\n\r\nperhaps  require  closer  attention of  the  various  Ministries\r\n\r\nconcerned, including NTUC, which together with its members could\r\n\r\nwork on a concerted effort to tackle the problems of these older\r\n\r\nworkers.   I would like to find out from the Minister  what  are\r\n\r\nthe plans it has to deal with these special problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, MCD reviews the\r\n\r\npublic  assistance given to the poor and needy  once  every  two\r\n\r\nyears.   I believe, this year, public assistance will be up  for\r\n\r\nreview also.  I would like to ask what adjustments will be  made\r\n\r\nto  increase  the  amount given out under the Public  Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than 28,000 being retrenched last year, I\r\n\r\nunderstand   not  all  those  who  lost  their   jobs   received\r\n\r\nretrenchment  benefits.   The  criteria  for  Public  Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme which till now still help only the very poor need  to  be\r\n\r\nrelaxed.   Older  retrenched workers,  particularly  those  with\r\n\r\noutdated skills and with families to support will need temporary\r\n\r\nhelp to tide\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthem   over  prolonged  unemployment,  especially  during   this\r\n\r\neconomic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask what schemes will be put in place to provide\r\n\r\ntemporary  assistance to those who have  been  out  of  the  job\r\n\r\nmarket for some time, especially those who have exhausted  their\r\n\r\nsavings?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, in the course of my\r\n\r\nconstituency work, I have come across many families who  are  in\r\n\r\nneed of financial assistance.  Very often, these people are in a\r\n\r\ndesperate  situation, either because they have lost their  jobs,\r\n\r\ntheir loved ones have passed away or they have been deserted  by\r\n\r\ntheir  spouses.  Invariably, where these families have children,\r\n\r\nit  is  often  the children who suffer as a consequence.   These\r\n\r\nresidents  have  the gumption to come to my  assistance  or  the\r\n\r\nassistance  of  my  CCC.   Invariably,  in  the  course  of  the\r\n\r\ninterview,  I  learn  that besides getting  in  touch  with  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations,  many  of  these  people   who   need\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance or public assistance are not aware  of  the\r\n\r\nmany  schemes  that are available which can be  of  help  during\r\n\r\nthese  difficult  times.   These public assistance  schemes  may\r\n\r\ninclude, for example, the Small Families Improvement Scheme, the\r\n\r\nCCC   Welfare   and   Education  Committee's  Scholarships   and\r\n\r\nBursaries, the CDC Assistance Scheme, to name a few.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about those who never thought of seeking assistance\r\n\r\nfrom  the  MP  or  the  grassroots organisations?   How  can  we\r\n\r\neffectively reach out to them and extend the assistance provided\r\n\r\nby these public assistance schemes?  For them, they operate in a\r\n\r\nworld  of ignorance, and unless we reach out to them, it may  be\r\n\r\nthat  they would never be able to take advantage of these public\r\n\r\nassistance schemes that are available.  Additionally,  it  could\r\n\r\nalso  be  that  many of these people are just too  shy  to  come\r\n\r\nforward  to  seek  the  assistance of  the  Government,  or  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary  welfare  organisations in  respect  of  these  public\r\n\r\nassistance schemes.  The fact that for many of these  people  in\r\n\r\nneed of financial assistance, they need to be told of the public\r\n\r\nassistance  schemes, either through the grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nor through the voluntary welfare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\norganisations, tells us that these schemes are not  very  widely\r\n\r\nknown  or well publicised.   If we want to do more for the  less\r\n\r\nfortunate Singaporeans, we should be more proactive rather  than\r\n\r\nreactive.  We should, in the first place, take steps to  educate\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  on what they can do or who they  can  turn  to  in\r\n\r\ntimes of need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen public information campaign run by the various\r\n\r\nMinistries, such as the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth.   However, I have yet to see a concerted effort  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Community  Development in running  mass  education\r\n\r\ncampaigns through the public media to inform Singaporeans of the\r\n\r\npublic  assistance schemes.  I am not sure whether MCD's  choice\r\n\r\nin  not using the public media to publicise these schemes arises\r\n\r\nfrom  a reluctance to encourage a perception of Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nwelfare  state.  Personally, I do not think using the  media  to\r\n\r\npublicise  the  schemes that are available  is  a  step  in  the\r\n\r\ndirection.  On the other hand, using the public media  maximises\r\n\r\nour effort in reaching out to those who are genuinely in need of\r\n\r\nassistance and thus helps us to care for them in a way which we,\r\n\r\nas   Singaporeans,  should.   Such effort  by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development  is important, particularly  during  this\r\n\r\ndifficult  time when more people are unemployed than before.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister whether more effort can be  made\r\n\r\nby  the Ministry to promote awareness among Singaporeans on  the\r\n\r\nvarious programmes and assistance that Singaporeans can turn  to\r\n\r\nfor help, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nSir,  in the past, some 29,000 workers were retrenched or facing\r\n\r\nretrenchment. According to a survey, the situation today is that\r\n\r\nout  of  every  ten job seekers, only four jobs  are  available.\r\n\r\nAnother survey shows that 50% of the retrenched workers  have to\r\n\r\nwait  for  nine  months before they can get another  job.   This\r\n\r\nshows that it is not easy to find alternative jobs nowadays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32% of the workers will be unemployed for more than nine\r\n\r\nmonths.  Being\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunemployed  for  nine  months is a long  period.   These  people\r\n\r\ndepend  on  their past savings to tide them over  the  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.   After  the nine months, I believe their  savings  would\r\n\r\nhave  been exhausted.  These people would probably have to  look\r\n\r\nto  the  Government agencies and other charitable  organisations\r\n\r\nfor  help.   We  know  that  the Singapore  Government's  Public\r\n\r\nAssistance Scheme is quite stringent in its allocation of funds.\r\n\r\nThe  amount allocated is barely enough to meet the basic  living\r\n\r\nexpenses.   Those  who are in receipt of this assistance  cannot\r\n\r\nhave other sources of income.  I would like the Minister to tell\r\n\r\nus whether there is an increase in the number of people who have\r\n\r\napplied  for  public assistance during the past one  year.   For\r\n\r\nthose  who have been unemployed for more than nine months,  will\r\n\r\nthe  Government be more liberal and sympathetic towards them  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can receive public assistance?  I am  making   these\r\n\r\nsuggestions  because those who are receiving  public  assistance\r\n\r\ncannot depend on it for a living for long.  As soon as they find\r\n\r\na job, they would not ask for public assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the amount they receive in the form of\r\n\r\npublic  assistance  is barely enough to meet  the  basic  living\r\n\r\nexpenses,  and therefore the recipients' standard of living  and\r\n\r\nquality of life have been affected   Their family members may be\r\n\r\nvery  young.    Therefore, a drop in the quality of  life  would\r\n\r\naffect  their  health. Can the Government  consider  allowing  a\r\n\r\npublic  assistance recipient's family members to work part  time\r\n\r\nto help make ends meet?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> According to\r\n\r\nthe  economic crisis  monitoring report of a number  of  clients\r\n\r\nfrom  Family  Service Centres, the people most affected  by  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  economic  downturn  were  female  single  parents  aged\r\n\r\nbetween  36-49  years  old and living in  2-room  flats.   Their\r\n\r\nproblems  were  primarily difficulties  in  securing  employment\r\n\r\nafter  retrenchment,  in  meeting  basic  household  needs   and\r\n\r\nchildren's school related expenses.  Other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfamilial  problems were also apparent like marital conflict  and\r\n\r\nmental health problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister: how does the public\r\n\r\nassistance  scheme help such families?  What is the  means  test\r\n\r\nbeing  applied and does the Minister think this is  an  adequate\r\n\r\nformula to follow?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between June and December 1998, there were 1,504\r\n\r\napplications  for public assistance compared to 814 applications\r\n\r\nbetween  January and May earlier.  We are seeing an 85% increase\r\n\r\nin  petitions.   During the last six months of  the  past  year,\r\n\r\nthere  were  136 applications for the Small Families Improvement\r\n\r\nScheme and 524 applications for assistance under RUAS.  Yet  the\r\n\r\nInterim  Financial Scheme only gave out $91,924.  This seems  to\r\n\r\nme  a small amount and my immediate reason is: is our means test\r\n\r\nfor  eligibility for financial assistance too mean?   Or  is  it\r\n\r\nbecause there is just that small number of applications  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  place?   Or  perhaps the procedures are so  onerous  that\r\n\r\nordinary folks give up applying for them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said yesterday that the safety net was\r\n\r\nadequate.  Yet, at the ground level, hotlines and social service\r\n\r\ncentres have registered a rise in the number of calls related to\r\n\r\nfinancial  difficulties.  There is less money for VWOs  to  hand\r\n\r\nout to distressed families due to shrinking funds and priorities\r\n\r\nare  given  to  developing  credible programmes  for  long  term\r\n\r\nbenefit, a strategy which I do agree with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister help me understand whether the spending\r\n\r\nof $91,924 in the last six months of 1998 was constrained by the\r\n\r\nlimited  availability  of  funds?  How  many  applications  were\r\n\r\nrejected and on what reasons?  I am glad to learn from Dr Ho Tat\r\n\r\nKin  earlier that the Public Assistance Scheme is up for  review\r\n\r\nthis year. The question I would then put to the Minister is: has\r\n\r\nthe Ministry developed a misery index to redefine and categorise\r\n\r\nthe  broad range of the poor and near-poor who may be long  term\r\n\r\nunemployed or unemployable?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made the call for identifying a misery index in\r\n\r\nAugust last year during the motion presented by Mr Lim Swee  Say\r\n\r\nand  Mr Seng Han Thong.  Please allow me to make that plea again\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we set up a cross-agency fact finding task force\r\n\r\ncomprising  Government statisticians, academics, social  workers\r\n\r\nand  others  to identify the distressed and design  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nspecific  misery index with indices which are socio-economic  in\r\n\r\nnature?   Some countries consider inflation and unemployment  as\r\n\r\nthe  significant measures.  If one includes other measures  like\r\n\r\nretrenchment  and  bankruptcies, the misery index  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nactually  would  indicate that Singapore was  quite  unhappy  in\r\n\r\n1998,  to  quote a Business Times report by Anna Teo in  January\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bankruptcies increased by 44.3% in the first eight months\r\n\r\nof  1998 over the same period in 1997, according to a report  by\r\n\r\nLianhe  Zaobao.  If  we  were to add more  indicators  like  the\r\n\r\ndecline  in  wages,  the  number of  mortgage  sales,  companies\r\n\r\nwinding  up,  CPF  default rate, rise in crime rate,  etc.,  the\r\n\r\nmisery index evidently will point to a rising gloom level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an index can be configured out of any combination of\r\n\r\nappropriate indicators.  I am not clear at this point  what  our\r\n\r\nstatisticians  use  as indicators to assess  the  socio-economic\r\n\r\nhealth of our society during this economic downturn.  Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister clarify this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without such information, we will never be certain in\r\n\r\nascertaining the citizens' well-being and even less clear  about\r\n\r\nwho  we  should help, how much and for how long.  It  cannot  be\r\n\r\nleft  to  social  institutions like the NCSS to carry  out  this\r\n\r\nsurvey  either  because it does not have the resources  nor  the\r\n\r\nmechanism to process such comprehensive data.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public assistance as a specific instrument to help the\r\n\r\ndestitute may need a fresh perspective to redefine its execution\r\n\r\nin  line  with  how  we determine the misery index  during  this\r\n\r\ndownturn.  Public assistance as a broad policy of assistance to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  needy will also require new points about what kind of  help\r\n\r\nis   more  critical  at  this  point.   It  does  not  mean  new\r\n\r\ndevelopment   projects  or  social  institutions.    But,   more\r\n\r\ncritically,  it would mean direct and duration specific  support\r\n\r\nprogrammes to distressed families.  I hope the energies spent in\r\n\r\nan  exercise  will  help the Ministry make a stronger  and  more\r\n\r\nforceful  request  for  a supplementary  budget  this  year,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, and a bigger budget next year.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, before I move on\r\n\r\nto  my  amendment,  let  me declare my interest.

It not only looks after the needy and the community,\r\n\r\nbut  I  think it carries two very important aspects of  software\r\n\r\nwithout which I think we will be at a loss.  I speak of the work\r\n\r\nof   the  People's  Association  (PA),  which  comes  under  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  as well as the Feedback Unit.  It is a very important\r\n\r\ninstrument.  And I think over the years, both these institutions\r\n\r\nhave grown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday's plea by the Members has made the writer of the\r\n\r\nGallery  column in the Straits Times, Miss Chua, to say that  we\r\n\r\nall have been very socialist.

Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister is not here after the Budget.  I would urge\r\n\r\nhim  to  give just less than half a billion dollars to MCD.

We have to be generous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will move on to the amendment now, Sir. I wholeheartedly\r\n\r\nagree with my\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChairman,  Dr  Vasoo,  and Mdm Claire Chiang  earlier  that  the\r\n\r\npublic assistance scheme must be re-examined.

I\r\n\r\nalso urge the Minister to go one step further.  We have Edusave.\r\n\r\nWe have Medisave. Can we save a substantial sum of money and set\r\n\r\naside  for a Community Fund?  I see no harm in being  a  bit  of\r\n\r\nwelfare state when there is a need, after all, the citizens have\r\n\r\nworked out.  Give them something in return, and this is the time\r\n\r\nnow  when  we  should  consider those of our  citizens  who  are\r\n\r\njobless,  sick  and  disabled.  They are not asking  for  public\r\n\r\nassistance  as  it is done in other countries, which  becomes  a\r\n\r\nsocial norm.  Here they do out of necessity, Sir.  I, therefore,\r\n\r\nurge the Minister to consider setting aside a fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, voluntary organisations and others are affected by\r\n\r\nthis  economic  downturn.   They  are  getting  less  funds.   I\r\n\r\ndisagree  with the political leadership that we should  not  dip\r\n\r\ninto  the  reserves.   There is no  need  to  dip  on  the  past\r\n\r\nreserves.  The present Government has got enough surpluses,  and\r\n\r\npart  of  the  surpluses could be set aside for  this  community\r\n\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as time is running short, I would touch on another\r\n\r\naspect  of  it.   The  Ministry should  also  strengthen  family\r\n\r\nvalues, as earlier Members have spoken.  I am glad that both the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health and MCD have come out with a package for  the\r\n\r\nelderly.  I think the people who have worked behind it have done\r\n\r\na  good job, and I hope and pray the Minister will adopt all the\r\n\r\nproposals.

The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproblem  has  to  be tackled from various fronts:  the  family's\r\n\r\nparticipation, the Police will have to play a role; the schools,\r\n\r\nthe  community and the rehabilitation agencies.   If  all  these\r\n\r\nfrontiers  could work together, then there will be a possibility\r\n\r\nto reduce the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of that, many young delinquents are placed in\r\n\r\ninstitutions  for  rehabilitation, how are they  prevented  from\r\n\r\nbeing  polluted by hardened delinquents?  I note  that  some  of\r\n\r\nthem who are very young are sent for rehabilitation.  There is a\r\n\r\nneed  to  implement  rehabilitation  measures  which  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  how to deal with these younger  persons  who  are\r\n\r\nsent for rehabilitation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area of concern is recidivism. It is common\r\n\r\nafter  these  juvenile  delinquents have  been  discharged  from\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  The success of rehabilitation depends on  follow-up measures carried out.  What I would like to find out from the\r\n\r\nMinister  is: what is the recidivism rate like and what measures\r\n\r\nare taken to deal with the problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, many people think of juveniles as kids\r\n\r\nwho  are  left  to themselves and cause trouble in the  shopping\r\n\r\nmalls.  They stare at each other, they get into fights.  Many of\r\n\r\nthe  juveniles are beyond parental control.  Some  339  children\r\n\r\nwere  brought  before the Subordinate Courts because  they  were\r\n\r\nbeyond  parental  control.   More  juvenile  crimes  are   being\r\n\r\nreported  and  more juveniles are being sent  to  reform  homes.\r\n\r\nStatistics  also  show that young juveniles are committing  more\r\n\r\nserious crimes.  Juveniles are no longer limited to boys.  Girls\r\n\r\nalso  form  gangs which are just as violent.   I was told  of  a\r\n\r\ncase  in a reputable girls' school where they actually set  fire\r\n\r\nto  the  school  toilet  to  express  dissatisfaction  with  the\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, with the Internet, children are not just left\r\n\r\nto  wander  by themselves in the shopping mall but also  in  the\r\n\r\nwhole  wide  world.   They can now be exposed  to  all  the  bad\r\n\r\nelements that are found on the Internet, without having to  step\r\n\r\nout of the home.  Children must therefore be trained\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  be  smart, especially on the Internet.  The old  grandmother\r\n\r\nteaching the children not to talk to strangers is just  as  true\r\n\r\ntoday for the Internet age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some views that certain groups of incorrigible\r\n\r\njuveniles  will not be suitable for treatment under the  current\r\n\r\njuvenile  justice system because of their attitude and character\r\n\r\nand  their  presence may make rehabilitation of  other  juvenile\r\n\r\noffenders in the juvenile justice system difficult.  May  I  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  how  true is this view, and what  statistics  are\r\n\r\navailable to support this allegation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Inter-Ministry Committee to review the Children and\r\n\r\nYoung Persons Act has been formed, with the objective of looking\r\n\r\nat  the adequacy of treatment options to deal with juveniles who\r\n\r\ncommit serious crimes.  May I ask what progress has been made by\r\n\r\nthis Inter-Ministry Committee?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in dealing with juvenile crimes, we should focus on\r\n\r\nthe  child and to see how best to reintegrate the kids back into\r\n\r\nsociety.  The family is the primary institution of care for  the\r\n\r\nyoung  and  good parenting is probably the single most important\r\n\r\nfactor  in  determining  the quality of the  upbringing  of  the\r\n\r\nchildren.   Good  parenting  skills today,  among  many  others,\r\n\r\nshould  include  capability  to  detect  signs  early  to  guide\r\n\r\ntroubled children and developing strategies to help them.   What\r\n\r\nprogrammes would the MCD provide to help parents to develop good\r\n\r\nparenting  skills?  What measures will be taken to  involve  the\r\n\r\nparents more in the rehabilitation of the juveniles?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, child abuse is on the increase and\r\n\r\npublic  education requires to inculcate both parents  and  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  in  care of their children to be more  fair  to  their\r\n\r\nchildren.   I am not against the idea of using the rod.   But  I\r\n\r\nthink  it should be used sparingly.  By all means, instill  fear\r\n\r\nin  the child, but do not go to the extent of abusing the child.\r\n\r\nMany  of  the children, unfortunately, those who are abused,  do\r\n\r\nnot  receive medical attention.

Perhaps  those  who  have\r\n\r\nexperienced  greater  racial and cultural integration  in  their\r\n\r\nworkplace, in schools, in the SAF, and in the communities may be\r\n\r\nbetter   able  to  understand  these  issues  from   a   broader\r\n\r\nperspective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first say that I agree with the Government's\r\n\r\napproach  of  having self-help groups on racial and ethnic  line\r\n\r\nbecause  in  order to get beyond race, we must first  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  race.  There is no other way.  In order to  treat  some\r\n\r\npeople equally, we must perhaps treat them differently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must realise that deep in our conscience, in our least\r\n\r\npolitical moments, when relaxing in the privacy of our homes, we\r\n\r\nare  very  much more likely than not to gravitate towards  those\r\n\r\nwhom we perceive as our own kind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of this recognition that we have groups that\r\n\r\nhave  been  able, through the various initiatives,  to  increase\r\n\r\ntheir  ethnic identity and consciousness and contribute  to  the\r\n\r\nself-esteem of ethnic minority.  They have been very  successful\r\n\r\nin   reaching   out  to  the  community,  attracting   dedicated\r\n\r\nvolunteers  and introducing programmes tailored to the  specific\r\n\r\ncultural and ethnic needs.  They have provided opportunities for\r\n\r\nunified and cohesive approach in dealing with the issues of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity and containing potential problems within the group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to caution that the very success of these\r\n\r\nself-help groups, based on powerful forces of race and  religion\r\n\r\nand  ethnic  identity,  can bring about a number  of  unintended\r\n\r\nconsequences.   I  am particularly troubled  by  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nunleashing  of  these  ethnic  energies,  while  successful   in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the  social infrastructure of the ethnic  community,\r\n\r\ncan  potentially  develop  to become  an  alternative  to  other\r\n\r\nsecular programmes,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninstead of being in support of the broader national objectives.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of education, for example. We have seen how\r\n\r\nethnic  communities  are  now able to provide  education  in  an\r\n\r\nentirely  ethnic  environment,  beginning  from  the  young   to\r\n\r\nadulthood.  While this may be a big step forward from the  point\r\n\r\nof  view  of  the  community, it can be regressive  and  a  step\r\n\r\nbackwards  for  the  ethnic community  and  for  all  of  us  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Experiences  in North America  have  shown  that  a\r\n\r\nseparate  ethnic  based education system has  not  succeeded  in\r\n\r\nproviding  lifelong  meaningful  employment  opportunities.   In\r\n\r\nfact, they may become a catalyst of isolationist tendencies, ie,\r\n\r\nextremism and hate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What hope can we have if a section of our community grows\r\n\r\nup   into  adulthood  in  an  entirely  different  ethnic  based\r\n\r\neducation?   What  hope have we got if we allow  them  to  erect\r\n\r\nwalls  between us and making it less possible to reach  out  and\r\n\r\nembrace  and  understand other communities in our  society?   We\r\n\r\nhave  seen how countries that have practised racial assimilation\r\n\r\nfor  years completely broken and fractured into divisive  ethnic\r\n\r\ncommunities   when   the   social   and   economic   environment\r\n\r\ndeteriorates.  Can our society survive such a challenge?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising that many of these ethnic issues\r\n\r\nsurfaced  during  the current economic crisis because  they  can\r\n\r\nblame racial discrimination for unemployment.  They can blame on\r\n\r\nthe  education policy and the lack of a level playing field  for\r\n\r\npoor scholastic achievement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned that these rules and practices within\r\n\r\nsome  of  these  self-help  groups which  contain  an  exclusive\r\n\r\nelement  in the Articles of Association will prevent  them  from\r\n\r\nproviding  some of these services to other racial  groups.   Why\r\n\r\ncannot  the  reverse happen?  Why should we  deny  someone  from\r\n\r\nanother  race  who may have very good reasons to participate  in\r\n\r\nthe  programmes of some other ethnic communities?   We  need  to\r\n\r\nadopt a more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninclusive  approach to make it easier for other members  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity to take part in these activities.  We now have colour-blind policies but not necessarily colour-blind programmes.  But\r\n\r\nthis must be our ultimate goal and we can do this by making  our\r\n\r\nprogrammes more accessible to other communities and seize  every\r\n\r\navailable opportunity for inter-racial collaboration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can you allow some time for the other\r\n\r\nMembers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> I will take another minute or\r\n\r\nso, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right, finish your speech, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> OK.

First  of  all, we must identify our  obstacles.   We\r\n\r\nshould  analyse the problems in a very analytical and  objective\r\n\r\nmanner  so  that we can concentrate our efforts  to  strive  for\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we must enhance the professional status of\r\n\r\nour athletes. The  prime time of these athletes is from 20 to 35\r\n\r\nyears  old,  after which they will need to have some  plans  for\r\n\r\ntheir  second  careers.   We have just a few hundred   sportsmen\r\n\r\nand  sportswomen who are capable of bringing glory to Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  think we should help them to develop some retirement plans so\r\n\r\nthat  they   can  feel assured that life after  competitions  is\r\n\r\nbeing  looked  after, and they can concentrate on their  present\r\n\r\nefforts to do well in the field of sports they excel in.  We can\r\n\r\nperhaps arrange for them to become coaches, trainers or physical\r\n\r\neducation   teachers   upon   their   retirement   from   active\r\n\r\ncompetitions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can you just ask the question?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Secondly, it is about the\r\n\r\nfunds  available to our national sports associations.

Sir, I will cover the cuts on social\r\n\r\nassistance by Dr Vasoo, Dr Ho, Mr Sin Boon Ann, Prof.  Low  Seow\r\n\r\nChay  and NMPs, Mdm Claire Chiang and Mr Shriniwas Rai.  On  the\r\n\r\nhelp  for  retrenched  workers, as  I  mentioned  in  my  speech\r\n\r\nyesterday,  there  is already quite a comprehensive  safety  net\r\n\r\navailable.   We have things like the approved Interim  Financial\r\n\r\nScheme, the Rent and Utilities Assistance Scheme (RUAS) and  the\r\n\r\nCDCs  and grassroots organisations launching new schemes to help\r\n\r\nthe  retrenched, including one-off national grants, tie-ups with\r\n\r\nhawker  stalls to offer hot meals and food and ration  vouchers.\r\n\r\nAll cases of hardship arising from retrenchment, especially when\r\n\r\nthe  breadwinner has difficulties finding another job,  will  be\r\n\r\ndealt with sympathetically by my Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry also links retrenched workers to other\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies  and  no child  will  be  denied  education\r\n\r\nbecause  of  financial difficulty in the  family.   For  working\r\n\r\nmothers  who have been retrenched, my Ministry has also extended\r\n\r\nthe period of Government childcare subsidy.  Low-income families\r\n\r\ncan also tap on the centre-based financial assistance scheme for\r\n\r\nchildcare  and  the back-to-work childcare scheme to  supplement\r\n\r\nsubsidies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low has asked if the Ministry allows PA recipients to\r\n\r\ntake  up  part-time jobs to supplement their  income.   Sir,  we\r\n\r\nencourage and assist indeed PA recipients to get a job.  We will\r\n\r\ntake  off PA only after we are satisfied that they have a steady\r\n\r\nincome to support themselves and their families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin asked whether we should push awareness of the target\r\n\r\naudience  on PA and all other assistance available in Singapore.\r\n\r\nSir,  instead of going on a media blitz, as Mr Sin suggested,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is better for us to go direct to the people involved,\r\n\r\npeople  who  care and look after the less fortunate and  to  the\r\n\r\nless  fortunate themselves.  We have, for example,  briefed  the\r\n\r\nCDCs,  members  of  grassroots organisations  and  VWOs  on  the\r\n\r\nschemes and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nservices MCD and its related agencies have to help all those  in\r\n\r\nfinancial  distress.  We have a directory of services given  out\r\n\r\nto  the  advisers to grassroots organisations, senior  managers,\r\n\r\ntown councils, HDB Branch Offices, PA, CDCs and VWOs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also involved, and this is important, the CDCs and\r\n\r\nRCs  on  an  outreach  programme for families.   This  programme\r\n\r\nbrings  together volunteers from the CDCs, the RCs and the  VWOs\r\n\r\nto  go from door to door to inform families residing in 1- or 2-room  flats  of  the schemes and services they can  tap  on.   A\r\n\r\nbooklet of all major schemes is given to the families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang asked for more help for single parents.\r\n\r\nI  assure  her  that every case in need will be helped.   Single\r\n\r\nparent families who do not qualify for PA may receive short-term\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance.  And once they are on PA, they  also  get\r\n\r\nother  forms  of assistance from other groups and their  school-going children will be referred to the Ministry of Education for\r\n\r\nhelp in their schooling expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to means test, the test is actually very simple\r\n\r\nand  people  merely need to call us or our agency if  they  need\r\n\r\nhelp,  and  they need not apply in person and no forms  will  be\r\n\r\nneeded to be filled if they want any help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the misery index, the index which she\r\n\r\nreferred  to includes other miseries as well, quite  apart  from\r\n\r\nPA.  So I am not too sure whether it can directly apply to us in\r\n\r\nthat  sense.   Anyway,  we  have  other  more  direct  means  of\r\n\r\nascertaining PA rates.  And for planning purposes, we have means\r\n\r\nsuch  as the minimum household expenditure survey data.  We  are\r\n\r\nreviewing  the  criteria for the PA scheme and sufficient  funds\r\n\r\nhave been set aside for PA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On juvenile delinquency, I agree with Dr Vasoo and Dr Ho\r\n\r\nthat arrests have indeed increased over the last two years after\r\n\r\na  drop  in 1996.  I would like to emphasise here that  parental\r\n\r\nand family involvement is the cornerstone in effective\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrehabilitation and parents who undergo orientation are  involved\r\n\r\nin  the  development and implementation of treatment  plans  for\r\n\r\ntheir  children.   Community involvement and support  also  help\r\n\r\nstrengthen and facilitate the rehabilitation process.  All these\r\n\r\nare highly featured in our rehabilitation protocols.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On institutionalisation and after care, Dr Vasoo may be\r\n\r\nhappy  to  know  that we have set up the new  Boys'  Complex  in\r\n\r\nJurong  to replace the old and dilapidated Singapore Boys'  Home\r\n\r\nA   and   B.    It  has  better  facilities  which   allow   for\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  more  rehabilitation  programmes.   What  is\r\n\r\nunique here too is that it has a classification centre where all\r\n\r\nnewly  admitted  juveniles are assessed by a  multi-disciplinary\r\n\r\nteam  of  professionals  for possible risks,  for  their  social\r\n\r\nemotional needs and the aptitude for training and education.  An\r\n\r\nindividual  care plan is then developed for more  effective  and\r\n\r\nfocused rehabilitation of each resident.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classification also allows the home to separate the boys in\r\n\r\ndifferent  dormitories  according  to  the  seriousness  of  the\r\n\r\noffences and also the degree of their delinquency.  So  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  will  avoid  contamination which the Member  is  concerned\r\n\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On incorrigible juveniles, as mentioned by Dr Ho, we are\r\n\r\nindeed seeing an increase of such offenders.  But in fact, world-wide,  we  are  seeing  the emergence of very  small  groups  of\r\n\r\njuveniles with extremely low or no rehabilitation potential, and\r\n\r\nthey  are  usually not remorseful about their offences  at  all.\r\n\r\nThe  number  in  Singapore, Sir, is actually  relatively  small,\r\n\r\nabout  five  to 10 cases each year in MCD homes.  They  are  not\r\n\r\nresponsive  to the homes' programmes.  They threaten the  safety\r\n\r\nof   residents  and  staff,  and  they  are  defiant  and   also\r\n\r\ndisruptive.  The incorrigible juvenile is usually brought before\r\n\r\nthe  Juvenile Court for transfer to the approved school or Young\r\n\r\nOffenders Section in the Reformatory Training Centre (RTC) under\r\n\r\nthe Prisons Department.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai talked about child abuse which has been\r\n\r\nincreasing.   I  agree with him.  It is a very serious  form  of\r\n\r\nabuse.  I agree with him that children should be loved and cared\r\n\r\nfor  and  not be abused, least of all by their parents  or  step\r\n\r\nparents.   I would like to assure Members that my Ministry  will\r\n\r\ncome  down  hard on child abuses.  While the number of  reported\r\n\r\ncases  of  child  abuse has gone up over the past  three  years,\r\n\r\naveraging  about  160  cases annually, the number  of  confirmed\r\n\r\ncases of abuse has actually been quite stable, averaging between\r\n\r\n25  and 28 cases annually.  I support the NMP's suggestion  that\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  community,  and particularly  the  neighbours,\r\n\r\nshould report all cases of child abuse.  The Member may wish  to\r\n\r\nknow that we have a child abuse hotline, managed by my Ministry,\r\n\r\nand indeed this is an avenue or conduit which the public can use\r\n\r\nto report child abuse cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure the NMP and members of the public that\r\n\r\nidentify people who report child abuse to my Ministry that  they\r\n\r\nare  kept strictly confidential.  All reports of suspected child\r\n\r\nabuse will be thoroughly investigated and looked into.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Similarly,  the  cost of educating  a  secondary  school\r\n\r\nstudent  has  also decreased from $5,208 in FY98  to  $4,992  in\r\n\r\nFY99.   If  the  per capita expenditure is not reduced  for  the\r\n\r\nprimary  and secondary school students, this will go a long  way\r\n\r\nto  meet  the  extra educational needs of the  pupils  in  their\r\n\r\nformative  years.  It would appear that the overall increase  in\r\n\r\nbudget  provisions  does not benefit the primary  and  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  students directly.  Here, we are talking about educating\r\n\r\na  student  population of 450,000.  Perhaps,  the  Minister  can\r\n\r\nclarify on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Education Ministry has a critical role to realise\r\n\r\nSingapore's  vision  of  \"Thinking  Schools,  Learning  Nation\".\r\n\r\nPrincipals  and teachers are key.  They are the  forces  in  the\r\n\r\nfrontline   delivering  the  Desired  Outcomes   of   Education.\r\n\r\nPrincipals  are given greater autonomy to manage their  schools.\r\n\r\nProject-based  learning  has  been  introduced.    Schools   are\r\n\r\nencouraged  to  organise  rigorous National  Education  and  ECA\r\n\r\nactivities.    Students   are  exposed   to   outdoor   learning\r\n\r\nactivities.   Innovative methods of teaching  and  learning  are\r\n\r\ninstituted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent incident of the Pulau Ubin tragedy and the Jin\r\n\r\nTai  School \"mock attack\" demonstrated certain weaknesses in our\r\n\r\nschool  management.  May I ask the Minister on how well-prepared\r\n\r\nand  equipped are our principals and teachers to cope  with  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  of  the new learning environment?  Serious  mistakes\r\n\r\nand unfortunate accidents can happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBut how can we assure the public that serious and grave mistakes\r\n\r\ndo  not lead to the endangering of the safety and health of  our\r\n\r\nstudents?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is adopting the ability-driven approach in\r\n\r\npolicy planning and practices.  The term \"mass customisation\" is\r\n\r\na  new  cliche and it has been used to represent this  approach.\r\n\r\nThe focus is on the individual's ability and developing them  to\r\n\r\nthe  fullest  potential.   All  abilities  are  required  in   a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.  The students are currently streamed on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of  the  overall grades in the school  subjects  but\r\n\r\nstudents have differing abilities in different subjects.   Would\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry be flexible to organise students on the  basis  of\r\n\r\ndifferent strengths and abilities in different subjects to  help\r\n\r\nthem improve and do better?  In a knowledge-based economy, every\r\n\r\nindividual needs to have a good basic education to build up  his\r\n\r\nlearning  capabilities.  Our young will grow to be  self-reliant\r\n\r\nif  they  can  benefit  fully from their primary  and  secondary\r\n\r\neducation.  You will realise that I have been focusing my speech\r\n\r\non  the  primary  and secondary education.   They  would  become\r\n\r\nemployable  in  different jobs in a future of multi-careers.   I\r\n\r\nwish  to  urge  the Ministry to work harder to  achieve  further\r\n\r\nimprovements in our students' performance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellence in school performance should not be confined to\r\n\r\nareas that are easily quantified and measurable.  Many important\r\n\r\nareas  of education that benefit the students are intangible  in\r\n\r\nnature.    There   has  been  the  over-emphasis   on   academic\r\n\r\nperformance  and  not enough emphasis on the non-academic  areas\r\n\r\nlike project work, ECAs, social and community work.  Perhaps the\r\n\r\nschool  ranking  system could be modified to  reflect  this  new\r\n\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of moral character of the person has become\r\n\r\nmore  crucial  with the wide access to information  through  the\r\n\r\nInternet. Imparting of positive values and teaching our young to\r\n\r\ndiscern  between  right from wrong are virtues  best  taught  in\r\n\r\ntheir  formative years.  Students who display poor  conduct  and\r\n\r\nbehaviour\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  be  corrected  early.  The Pastoral  Care  and  Guidance\r\n\r\nProgramme, if successfully carried out, would have the long term\r\n\r\npositive impact on the students.  I wish to urge the Ministry to\r\n\r\ncontinue to devote more resources in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want our students to become more creative. But music is\r\n\r\nnot fully exploited as a normal learning activity.  Research has\r\n\r\nshown  that music even helps babies in their mental development.\r\n\r\nThe large number of children taking music lessons attests to the\r\n\r\nvalue   parents  place  in  the  overall  development  of  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  Should not the school provide music learning for  all\r\n\r\nstudents  rather  than  treating music  as  a  special  elective\r\n\r\nsubject  catering to a select few?  Sound Blaster was  developed\r\n\r\nby  Creative  Technology's Mr Sim Wong  Hoo  who  himself  is  a\r\n\r\nharmonica  player.   His  love  for  music  has  paid   handsome\r\n\r\ndividends.   So, I think it is important for us  to  bring  back\r\n\r\nmusic  where  I  believe  many of  us,  when  we  were  younger,\r\n\r\nbenefited from the music lessons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we are proud of our achievements in the\r\n\r\nfield  of  education.   Our educational system  has  been  rated\r\n\r\nhighly  by other countries and international agencies.  We  have\r\n\r\nhad a good start.  We have a strong and firm foundation on which\r\n\r\nto  build further.  The Government is right to invest heavily in\r\n\r\nthe  education  of  our young.  This long-term investment  would\r\n\r\nbear   fruits  only  a  generation  later  after  this   present\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  long  gone.  This  is  an  act  of  a  good  and\r\n\r\nresponsible Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the Desired Outcomes of\r\n\r\nEducation  articulate  explicitly  what  the  education   system\r\n\r\nintends  to  develop  in our children at  each  stage  of  their\r\n\r\neducation.  Mr Wee Heng Tin, Director-General of Education,  has\r\n\r\nsuccinctly described the end result as a whole child, who  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  skills and knowledge, possesses sound morals, strength  of\r\n\r\ncharacter,   healthy  habits,  team  spirit  and  an   aesthetic\r\n\r\nappreciation for the world around him.  Each child grows into  a\r\n\r\nresponsible and committed citizen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are indeed desirable qualities and values for our\r\n\r\nyoung to possess.  These are also the qualities and values  that\r\n\r\nour  young must possess to fit into the challenging future.   To\r\n\r\nachieve  the  Desired  Outcomes, our  education  system  has  to\r\n\r\nchange.   It  is important that we manage this change  properly.\r\n\r\nOur  education  system has served us well.   Our  students  have\r\n\r\nperformed  superbly in international tests.  They have  competed\r\n\r\nwell  in foreign universities.  Many countries want to copy  us.\r\n\r\nHence,  the need to change may not be clear to the people.   But\r\n\r\nif they know and understand the rationale for the changes, their\r\n\r\nsupport  will  be stronger and more forthcoming.   The  Ministry\r\n\r\nneeds to continue with its efforts to explain to the people  the\r\n\r\nreasons for change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our principals and teachers are major players, helping our\r\n\r\nchildren  to  achieve  the  Desired  Outcomes.   Principals  and\r\n\r\nteachers  are  major  change agents  in  the  process  and  must\r\n\r\nthemselves first adapt to the changes.  They must be comfortable\r\n\r\nwith the changes if they are to help the children.  But how  are\r\n\r\nthey  coping  with the changes?  Could the Minister  give  us  a\r\n\r\nreview  of the current situation in respect to our teachers  and\r\n\r\nprincipals?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has done much to work with the teachers but I\r\n\r\nam  still getting feedback from teachers that they feel a lot of\r\n\r\nstress.  They feel that they are still largely assessed  on  the\r\n\r\nacademic performance of their students.  Meanwhile, the emphasis\r\n\r\non  non-academic  aspects has increased.  New initiatives,  like\r\n\r\nschool clusters and autonomy, add to the pressure.  These create\r\n\r\nnew administrative duties such as attending meetings, taking and\r\n\r\nwriting  of minutes and coordination of activities.   They  also\r\n\r\nneed to go for training as a result of new technologies like IT.\r\n\r\nTo  cope with the work, they often stay back late in school  and\r\n\r\ncome  back  on Saturdays.  They find the life of a teacher  very\r\n\r\nstressful.   How  many  teachers,  especially  those  with  long\r\n\r\nservices,  have resigned in the last few years as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nstress?  What further help can we give to teachers to ease their\r\n\r\nstress and keep them in the service?  Should we also not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  making changes to the way we train our teachers for  a  role\r\n\r\nthat has changed?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals play an important role in introducing and\r\n\r\nmanaging  change.   A  principal who  is  a  good  manager,  who\r\n\r\nunderstands the difficulties and constraints faced by staff, can\r\n\r\nhelp  to  ease in the change.  A principal who is a poor manager\r\n\r\nadds  pressure  on  his  or her staff.  In  a  rapidly  changing\r\n\r\nenvironment,  a principal may become over-enthusiastic  and  may\r\n\r\ntake  on  more  than  he can comfortably  handle.  He  may  then\r\n\r\noverlook details and fail to anticipate potential problems.   An\r\n\r\noverload  of  activities initiated by a principal can  also  put\r\n\r\nstress on the teachers.  We are more aware of the efforts put in\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry to help our teachers than those  to  help  our\r\n\r\nprincipals.   What training and help have been provided  to  our\r\n\r\nprincipals,  especially  those newly promoted  ones,  to  better\r\n\r\nmanage their schools?  Recently, there were a few mishaps in our\r\n\r\nschools.   I  wonder  if the Minister could share  with  us  the\r\n\r\nfindings of his Ministry on some of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me hasten to add that, on the whole, our principals and\r\n\r\nteachers  are coping well with the changes.  But any  effort  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them to better adapt to the changes required will  benefit\r\n\r\nthem  and  the children under their care even more.  The  school\r\n\r\nalso  needs  the  involvement of parents and  the  community  to\r\n\r\nachieve  the  Desired Outcomes.  The school needs the  home  and\r\n\r\nsociety  to  endorse  and reinforce good  behaviour  and  values\r\n\r\nimparted by the school to the child.  To get the children to  be\r\n\r\nmore  involved  in  the  community,  the  Ministry  started  the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Involvement Scheme. To foster the support of  parents\r\n\r\nand  the community for the schools, the Minister late last  year\r\n\r\nset  up an Advisory Council of the Committee and Parents Support\r\n\r\nSystem.  It is a far-reaching idea.  The school is a part of the\r\n\r\ncommunity.    Their  children study there.   The  community  and\r\n\r\nparents  are  interested  in how the schools  in  the  community\r\n\r\noperate.  Could the Minister update us on the progress made with\r\n\r\nthese efforts to involve the community and parents?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one suggestion which I would like the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider.   At  the  moment,  there is  no  national  forum  for\r\n\r\ninterested  parents,  community leaders, school  principals  and\r\n\r\nteachers to discuss common issues.  I would like the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider organising such a national forum.  We can consider  the\r\n\r\nmodel  of the triennial conference of grassroots leaders the  PA\r\n\r\nuses  to bring together grassroots leaders across Singapore  and\r\n\r\nPA  staff.   Many good suggestions surface during the conference\r\n\r\nand  these ideas have moved forward the grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nand  their  effectiveness.  The conference made  the  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders  felt recognised, motivated and wanted.  I believe  that\r\n\r\nsuch  a  conference  could  bring  together  parents,  community\r\n\r\nleaders  and  educators  and  will similarly  motivate  everyone\r\n\r\ninvolved  to do more for the school to the ultimate  benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe students, school and the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would like to thank\r\n\r\nthe  Minister and his team of officers at the Ministry, and  all\r\n\r\nthe  principals and teachers for their hard work in 1998.  A lot\r\n\r\nof  changes  and improvements have been done.  As  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nour education system is something all of us can be proud of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this afternoon, I just want to bring up one point.\r\n\r\nOne  of  the  Desired Outcomes of Education,  obviously,  is  to\r\n\r\nprepare  young Singaporeans to be the knowledge workers  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   One day, two students were challenging each  other  on\r\n\r\nwho  is  better prepared to be a knowledge worker  of  tomorrow.\r\n\r\nOne said to the other, \"Assuming I am a prisoner and you are the\r\n\r\npoliceman.   I  am handcuffed and I need to go  to  the  toilet.\r\n\r\nYou,  as a policeman, would not want to follow me to the toilet.\r\n\r\nWhat can you do to stop me from escaping?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other student said, \"No problem. All I have to do is\r\n\r\nto  take a rope, put it through your handcuff, and then hold the\r\n\r\ntwo  ends of the rope outside the toilet.  There is no  way  you\r\n\r\ncan escape, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to simulate this, maybe I can ask Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang  to  help me out with this.  See, there is no way  I  can\r\n\r\nescape, because, in a way, the two loops are in a dead lock.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> You can take out your handcuff!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> No. Assuming this is a real handcuff.\r\n\r\nThere is no way I can get out of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the student acting as prisoner said, \"I give it to you.\r\n\r\nI think you are ready to be a knowledge worker of the future.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student acting as policeman then said, \"Very good, but\r\n\r\nnow  I  challenge  you back.  Are you ready to  be  a  knowledge\r\n\r\nworker  of  the  future?  Will you be able  to  find  a  way  to\r\n\r\nescape?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This other student said, \"No problem, I could escape in\r\n\r\njust  one second.\"  Because the way to look at the situation  is\r\n\r\nthis.  You define the problem as two interlocking loops.  I  can\r\n\r\nalways  redefine the situation as one of two loops, parallel  to\r\n\r\neach other, circulating my arms.  For me to disengage these  two\r\n\r\nloops,  all I have to do is to bring the first loop through  the\r\n\r\nsecond loop and then see what happens?  The rope goes through my\r\n\r\nhand and it comes out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I use this example to illustrate the point that to be\r\n\r\nknowledge workers of the future, our students not only  have  to\r\n\r\nacquire  knowledge,  not  only  have  they  to  learn  to  apply\r\n\r\nknowledge but, more importantly, they have to learn to  innovate\r\n\r\nwith knowledge.  In our human brain, we have countless number of\r\n\r\nbrain  cells.   The  challenge is to  help  our  students  build\r\n\r\nconnections to link up as many brain cells as possible,  because\r\n\r\nI  was  told by the experts that the more connections there  are\r\n\r\namong  our  brain cells, the better, the faster we are  able  to\r\n\r\nthink.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appreciate it if the Minister can update this House\r\n\r\non  what have been done up to now, and what will be done in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  to  continue  to  stimulate  the  minds  of  our   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans so that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey  can  be  more  creative  and  innovative,  and  to  become\r\n\r\ncompetitive and productive knowledge workers of tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I was just wondering how the hon. Member\r\n\r\nexpects us to record all that in Hansard.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, may I propose that Hansard goes\r\n\r\nmultimedia?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I would like to urge the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider increasing the emphasis on volunteerism  as\r\n\r\nan additional school activity for achieving the Desired Outcomes\r\n\r\nof  Education.   This  is in line with our  national  effort  in\r\n\r\npromoting  volunteerism as a way of life for  all  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nLet me elaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, by building community service as part of their\r\n\r\ncourse  work,  students  in primary and  secondary  levels  will\r\n\r\ndevelop  an  ethic  of service.  We have so  far  committed  our\r\n\r\nstudents  to  just six hours of community service per  year.   I\r\n\r\nfeel that this is not enough.  Some public school systems in the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  stipulate that students  complete  75  hours  of\r\n\r\nservice  between  the 6th and 12th grades as a  requirement  for\r\n\r\nsecondary school graduation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, studies have shown that by regularising and\r\n\r\nintensifying  service contacts with the community, students  who\r\n\r\ndevoted   their   time  to  service  learning   also   do   well\r\n\r\nacademically,  develop higher order thinking, social  and  civic\r\n\r\nresponsibility, greater acceptance of cultural diversity  and  a\r\n\r\nhigher  level of self esteem.  This is in line with the  desired\r\n\r\noutcome of our education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second argument for increased community service for\r\n\r\nstudents  is  the  enhancement of an ethic of  citizenship.   By\r\n\r\nengaging in community service, students become active members in\r\n\r\nidentifying  the  needs  of,  and  seeking  solutions  for,  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   Such  first-hand  experience  helps  to   translate\r\n\r\nclassroom  exhortation  on being caring  to  seeking  real-world\r\n\r\nsolutions,   an   exercise  of  reflection   and   action   that\r\n\r\nincrementally engage our young as active members, as concerned\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncitizens.   This is the best stake-holding experience to  foster\r\n\r\nin our young a sense of belonging, by making them feel that what\r\n\r\nthey  are doing for Singapore makes a difference.  Sir, it is  a\r\n\r\npowerful emotion of participation and commitment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would further urge the Minister to consider allocating\r\n\r\nsome  start-up resources to tertiary student bodies  to  develop\r\n\r\noutreach programmes with respect to community service as well as\r\n\r\nleadership  programmes  to train and maintain  campus  volunteer\r\n\r\ncoordination activities.  These volunteers best serve  as  \"peer\r\n\r\nmentors\" to our young students at the secondary level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third argument is: by increasing the number of hours for\r\n\r\nservice engagement, there is room for mixing student groups from\r\n\r\ndifferent  ethnic backgrounds and academic streams,  maybe  even\r\n\r\nfrom different schools and tertiary institutions to cooperate on\r\n\r\na project.  This not only promotes multi-cultural understanding,\r\n\r\nit  also creates a mutually learning environment for students to\r\n\r\nbe  exposed to differences and new opportunities of finding ways\r\n\r\nto  relate to and learn from one another.  We may transform  the\r\n\r\nugly Singaporean to becoming appreciative Singaporean, if I  may\r\n\r\nborrow the Minister of State Mr Peter Chen's characterisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry will strongly encourage school\r\n\r\nprincipals to work with various social service organisations  in\r\n\r\nthe  vicinity to develop a volunteer service network.   In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  the  setting up of COMPASS (Community and  Parents  in\r\n\r\nSupport   of   Schools  Advisory  Council)  was  a   commendable\r\n\r\ninitiative.  A consistent, system-wide approach in the planning,\r\n\r\nscheduling,  orientation and training of volunteers  in  various\r\n\r\nservice  engagements  has to be in place  to  sustain  students'\r\n\r\ninterest  in community service.  Perhaps an outstanding  service\r\n\r\naward  can  be  given by schools to students  who  perform  well\r\n\r\nacademically as well as show community spirit through a  genuine\r\n\r\ninterest  in helping others.  The NKF Champion's award  launched\r\n\r\nin 1997 by Minister\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTeo  Chee  Hean is one such initiative. Hopefully, by  repeating\r\n\r\nthese initiatives at every school, the ethic of volunteerism, as\r\n\r\na  way of life and citizenship, will be a powerful catalyst  for\r\n\r\ncommunity enhancement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, one long-term\r\n\r\nobjective   of  the  Education  Ministry  is  to  increase   the\r\n\r\nopportunities for young Singaporeans to seek further  education.\r\n\r\nOur  education system strives to reduce the drop-out rate  among\r\n\r\nstudents at all levels of schooling.  This is a noble aspiration\r\n\r\nwhich will hopefully be pursued further.  To raise our students'\r\n\r\nperformance  through  competition, the  Education  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nimplemented a school ranking system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we see normally is that schools at the top are those\r\n\r\nthat are already known to be very good.  On the other hand, year\r\n\r\nafter  year,  the  majority of neighbourhood  schools  form  the\r\n\r\ncategory at the bottom of the ranking list.  If Singapore  wants\r\n\r\nto  prepare our young citizens in the best way possible for  the\r\n\r\nera  of knowledge-based economy, we should help them to maximise\r\n\r\ntheir  potentials,  regardless of  whether  they  study  in  the\r\n\r\noutstanding  schools or ordinary neighbourhood schools.   Hence,\r\n\r\nwhile we accord recognition to the leading schools at the top of\r\n\r\nthe  ranking  every  year, I hope we will not  neglect  to  give\r\n\r\nattention to neighbourhood schools whose academic performance is\r\n\r\nnot  on  par  with  the  better schools.   We  should  give  all\r\n\r\nencouragement  and support in terms of basic facilities,  effort\r\n\r\nand  also  good teachers to neighbourhood schools so that  their\r\n\r\nstudents,  the  majority  of  whom  are  children  of   moderate\r\n\r\nfamilies, could improve their performance in school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to see value-added performance\r\n\r\nbeing given due attention and recognition in placing schools  on\r\n\r\nthe  ranking list every year.  Whether we like it or not, socio-economic  and  income levels of families have an impact  on  the\r\n\r\neducational  performance of students.  Many  adult  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  have  succeeded  today come from such  families.   We  took\r\n\r\nadvantage of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\navailable  opportunities  to compete and  improve  ourselves  in\r\n\r\neducation  and career.  If students from moderate and low-income\r\n\r\nfamilies could achieve good performance in education, they  will\r\n\r\ncertainly find sweet success.  This is among the characteristics\r\n\r\nof Singaporeans.  We should support and motivate the cultivation\r\n\r\nof  values  which  help  in  the creation  of  this  value-added\r\n\r\nperformance.   I raise this question because I believe  that  it\r\n\r\nwill   help   in  developing  self-confidence,  motivation   and\r\n\r\ncapability among our young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage children from moderate families and those\r\n\r\nwhose  past  performance did not achieve good  results  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  all available opportunities in  schools,  I  hope\r\n\r\ntheir  \"value-added performance\" will be given extra  points  in\r\n\r\nschool  ranking.  We wish to see our children whose  performance\r\n\r\nwas  not good at an earlier level achieve better performance  at\r\n\r\nthe next level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learn that the Ministry of Education now does not rank\r\n\r\nschools  only.  It is also implementing ranking among  teachers.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  sure whether this will produce a favourable outcome.\r\n\r\nBut  if  ranking  among  teachers can help  in  improving  their\r\n\r\nperformance, this is good enough for me.  If it is  accepted  as\r\n\r\ngood,  I  would  like to suggest that teachers who   help  their\r\n\r\nstudents  in achieving \"value-added performance\" be  given  more\r\n\r\npoints in the ranking.  We should send the correct signal to our\r\n\r\neducators  that  no  matter how low is the  performance  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents  who  enter  their schools, these  students  should  be\r\n\r\nhelped to realise their potentials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, I would like to ask the Education Minister about\r\n\r\nhis  assessment  of our students'  \"value-added performance\"  at\r\n\r\nvarious  levels.   Have  we seen a visible  improvement  in  our\r\n\r\nstudents'  achievement?   What we  do  not  wish  to  see  is  a\r\n\r\nsituation  whereby \"what is pursued is not obtained, while  what\r\n\r\nwe  have falls out of our grasp\", meaning that while value-added\r\n\r\nperformance  does  not improve significantly, the  stress  level\r\n\r\nexperienced by teachers rises.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related subject, our schools have received much from\r\n\r\nthe  Edusave funds to provide special courses for our  students.\r\n\r\nDoes the Ministry decide on different criteria or guidelines for\r\n\r\ndifferent   courses?   Many  schools  obtain  the  services   of\r\n\r\norganisations outside schools to run the courses.  How does  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  determine  that the courses offered  to  students  are\r\n\r\ngood?\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nraise concern over the anguish felt by many students and parents\r\n\r\nin lieu of the early operating hours in our schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported in the Straits Times that Tan Ming Ming\r\n\r\n(not  her  real name), an eight-year-old in Primary  2  gets  up\r\n\r\nevery morning at 5.00 am to catch a school bus at 5.45 am.  This\r\n\r\nis  so that she can be in school by 7.20 am.  This is a familiar\r\n\r\nstory and a cause of much anguish expressed by many parents.   I\r\n\r\nthink  we  need  to  review this correctable  situation.   I  am\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that  whenever possible, as in the case  of  single-session schools, the schools should start later, at say 8.20  am\r\n\r\nearliest. This will enable school buses to stagger pick-up times\r\n\r\nand   ease   the   traffic  flow  in  the   mornings   somewhat.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  the  peak rush hour for the  office  workers,  who\r\n\r\nusually   start  work  at  9.00  am  would  not   be   adversely\r\n\r\ncompromised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many single-session primary and secondary schools\r\n\r\nthat still stick to the 7.20 am start times when, in fact, there\r\n\r\nis  no  more  need  for  it to be so. A change  will  avoid  the\r\n\r\nfrustrations in the early and dark hours of the morning for many\r\n\r\nstudents  going  to school.  This will reduce  the  pressure  on\r\n\r\nparents  who  have  to get up to prepare the breakfast  for  the\r\n\r\nchildren  who, in turn, complain that they have no  appetite  at\r\n\r\nsuch  a time in the morning.  This will mean that students  have\r\n\r\nto eat lunches in schools and stay longer in schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, in fact, is a good thing, which brings me to my\r\n\r\nsecond point, relating to the \"after school care\". Sir, there is\r\n\r\na place\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  all  schools to provide \"after school care\"  to  those  who\r\n\r\nrequire  this facility.  This would be especially easy with  the\r\n\r\nsingle  session  schools.  We should cater for a changing  trend\r\n\r\nwhere  many families become dual-income earners.  This trend  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to stay, and parents would be delighted to know  that  as\r\n\r\nthey  work, their children are safe and are supervised in  their\r\n\r\nwork  after  school.   This  latchkey system  can  also  prevent\r\n\r\nchildren from mixing with the wrong crowds after school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact now that many students get private tuition\r\n\r\nthat can cost hundreds of dollars per month and tax heavily upon\r\n\r\nthe  resources of the family.  Perhaps the extra  help  or  even\r\n\r\ngroup  tuition  given  after school will  lessen  the  financial\r\n\r\nburdens in many families.  Although more Before-and-After-School-Care  Centres  are being set up in HDB void decks and  community\r\n\r\ncentres, I feel that schools would really be ideal for this type\r\n\r\nof care.  The convenience and lower cost will be plus points for\r\n\r\nsuch care at schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education can allow schools to employ part-time staff, encourage volunteer parents and tap resources from\r\n\r\ngrassroots  and voluntary groups to mind the after  school  care\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  Space constraints have been given as the reason  by\r\n\r\nmany  against the idea.  The truth is that a converted classroom\r\n\r\nor  a  simple portable cabin or container is all that is needed.\r\n\r\nSir, I hope the Ministry of Education could look in further  and\r\n\r\nimprove in these two areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the Ministry of Education has\r\n\r\nreceived  the most number of amendments.  It shows  how  popular\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry is and how all Singaporeans, including Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House, take education as a serious issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak on two aspects of the school.\r\n\r\nFirst,  SAP  schools.   Last week, Mr Shanmugam  spoke  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter.    After  his  speech, the Prime Minister  spoke  to  Dr\r\n\r\nVasoo,  Mr Shanmugam and myself on the issue.  We gave  him  our\r\n\r\nfeedback.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDPM  Lee  informed the House that we had moved from the colonial\r\n\r\ndays  when  schools were based on language.   That  is  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has the Sang Nila Utama Secondary School and the Amar\r\n\r\nPulavar  Tamil Secondary School and there were numerous  Chinese\r\n\r\nprimary schools and secondary schools.  Things have changed  for\r\n\r\nthe  better. We have now moved to SAP schools.  There have  been\r\n\r\nsome  reservations.   I  hope  the Minister  would  address  the\r\n\r\nreservations that Mr Shanmugam has raised in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have discussed this matter with several friends, inside\r\n\r\nthe  House as well as outside the House.  The views seem  to  be\r\n\r\ndivided.  Many feel that the minority communities are not  being\r\n\r\nsensitive   to  the  majority  community.   They   say   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  has  been  closed, so  have  many  Chinese  schools.\r\n\r\nUnless  there is a national effort to keep the Chinese  language\r\n\r\nand culture alive, it would disappear from the scene.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nowhere is this more visible than if you look at the\r\n\r\ndress  of  my Chinese friends.  The Indian and Malay communities\r\n\r\nstill preserve this national dress for both the ladies and  men.\r\n\r\nThe  Chinese  members  of  Singapore have  totally  adopted  the\r\n\r\nwestern  dress.   Whether it is good or bad, I  am  not  passing\r\n\r\njudgement.   But  just one classic case.  Over  the  years,  the\r\n\r\ncultural values have changed.  All I would urge is that whatever\r\n\r\neducation  system  we choose, it must suit our  national  multi-racial and multi-cultural needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my advice to those members of the minority\r\n\r\ncommunities  who  want SAP schools for Malays  and  Indians.   I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  them  not  to do so.  To do  so  would  be  counter\r\n\r\nproductive.  You are going to allow these people to be  isolated\r\n\r\nin  small cocoons and they will never have much to do with other\r\n\r\ncommunities.   It  is not very sound to have  this  proposition.\r\n\r\nThe  lead  must  come from all the communities and  through  the\r\n\r\nmeritocratic  process, it will throw up some of  the  best  from\r\n\r\nthis stream.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move on to another aspect. I would call it\r\n\r\n\"Privatisation of Schools\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  Government's move with independent schools is a  good  one.\r\n\r\nCan  we  move one step further?  Would the Minister consider  in\r\n\r\nthe  long  term that schools be run by Town Councils?   Get  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  involved in the running of schools.   Many  countries\r\n\r\nhave  done this.  I know some Members are laughing.  They  think\r\n\r\nit  is  an  idea  that  is not worthwhile.  But  if  independent\r\n\r\nschools  can  work, why cannot schools be run by the  community?\r\n\r\nIn many countries, the community is involved in education.  Some\r\n\r\nof  the best schools are run by the community.  The Minister may\r\n\r\nwant  to consider this in the long term process.  If he  is  not\r\n\r\nprepared  to do that, is he prepared to allow the administration\r\n\r\nof the school to be passed to the community?  I leave it to him.\r\n\r\nThe choice is his.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point which I would like to raise is this. Would\r\n\r\nthe Government give encouragement to private schools so that  we\r\n\r\ncould  become a hub for education not only at the tertiary level\r\n\r\nbut  even  at  the  secondary level?  We can become  a  hub  for\r\n\r\neducation in this part of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I understand the\r\n\r\nreasons behind the setting up of SAP schools, and I support  it.\r\n\r\nHaving  said  that,  I am also concerned about  the  SAP  school\r\n\r\nstudents  having little opportunity of interaction with students\r\n\r\nfrom  the other races, ie, the Malays and the Indians.  It is  a\r\n\r\nconcern of our minority races as well as it is a well known fact\r\n\r\nthat  a  sizable  number of able Chinese  students  attend  such\r\n\r\nschools and some are going to be leaders of this country.   That\r\n\r\nis  why as far back as 1990, the former Member of Parliament, Mr\r\n\r\nChandra  Das, brought this issue to the House.  I also  remember\r\n\r\nin  1995,  the  Nominated Member of Parliament, Kanwaljit  Soin,\r\n\r\nalso  brought up this matter in this House.  Both expressed  the\r\n\r\nworry  that  there is little mixing of SAP school students  with\r\n\r\nothers.   On both occasions, I offered a way out of this concern\r\n\r\nby calling for the twinning of a SAP school with a national-type\r\n\r\nschool.   Obviously, no one paid attention to my  call.   Or  Mr\r\n\r\nShanmugam  would not have to come to this House again and  bring\r\n\r\nup the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsame matter.  Let me quote what I said in 1990, nine years ago:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The twinning of schools would allow the schools involved\r\n\r\nto  develop programmes in the non-academic areas.  For a  start,\r\n\r\nlike  games, having a common rugby team with players  from  both\r\n\r\nschools,  common  football team, netball team, and  also  common\r\n\r\ncadet  or scout groups.  If such programmes work out well,  then\r\n\r\nother  areas, including sharing academic teaching methods, could\r\n\r\nbe  explored.  These schools should be sited preferably close to\r\n\r\neach other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shanmugam gave a profound and thought-provoking\r\n\r\ndiscourse on the concerns of the minority.  He goes beyond  just\r\n\r\nthe  SAP  schools.    He questioned the very  fundamentals  upon\r\n\r\nwhich this society was built, ie, multi-racialism.  Amongst many\r\n\r\nother  topics,  he  expressed  similar  fears  that  SAP  school\r\n\r\nstudents may not be able to empathise with other races.  I quote\r\n\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whatever we say, I think it undeniable that their empathy,\r\n\r\ntheir  understanding of the minority communities would  be  less\r\n\r\nthan  that  of  their predecessors who grew up in  schools  with\r\n\r\nmembers of the other races.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, on that very day, there was a call by the\r\n\r\nAssociation  of  Muslim  Professionals  to  study  SAP  schools'\r\n\r\npolicies  on  racial  bonds.  This morning,  NMP  Zulkifli  also\r\n\r\nexpressed similar fears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister gave what I thought was a frank\r\n\r\nand  honest response. To me, it was a good response.  I am  sure\r\n\r\nMr  Shanmugam understands but I am not so sure that  his  ground\r\n\r\ndoes.   People want assurances, not by words, but  by  deeds  in\r\n\r\nsuch  situations.  Therefore, we must translate  our  intentions\r\n\r\ninto  really working models at the ground level.  I believe this\r\n\r\ncan  be  done.  The reason why my original idea of twinning  was\r\n\r\nnot  taken  up seriously was probably due to a lack of awareness\r\n\r\nof  the serious misgivings amongst the minority races.  However,\r\n\r\nhaving listened to the Deputy Prime Minister's suggestion of the\r\n\r\ncluster school concept, I am inclined to go along with it.   But\r\n\r\nthe cluster school concept must be clearly defined.  And it must\r\n\r\nexpand its administrative role to include activities of the kind\r\n\r\nI  suggested in my twin school concept. DPM suggested  that  the\r\n\r\nSAP schools should be part of the cluster of schools so that the\r\n\r\nstudents from the SAP\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nschools will have greater opportunities to interact with non-SAP\r\n\r\nschools  within that cluster.  I  like that idea.  It should  be\r\n\r\nexplored further.   But it must be properly structured  with  an\r\n\r\nappraisal system and an appraisal team monitoring it,  and  with\r\n\r\ngood  publicity given.  This way, I hope our minority races will\r\n\r\nfeel more comfortable about our SAP schools.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can never totally address this problem because of\r\n\r\nthe  way  that  SAP  schools were set up.  But  we  can  try  to\r\n\r\nminimise  the  minorities'  concerns  with  the  cluster  school\r\n\r\nconcept.   However, it is not just at our SAP school level  that\r\n\r\nwe  want  to  see better interaction.  There is  more  to  this.\r\n\r\nWhile  it  is  the moral duty of the majority race in  a  multi-racial society to look after the interest of the minority races,\r\n\r\nour  minorities  must  also  make special  effort  to  come  and\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the many activities organised by  the  CCs  and\r\n\r\nResidents'  Committees at the community  level.   I  lament  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  low rate of participation.  Great effort by every  race\r\n\r\nshould be made to make our multi-racial society work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister would take what I suggest seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, having heard Dr Tan\r\n\r\nCheng  Bock  and Mr Rai on their opinions on the SAP schools,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that their worry is unnecessary.  They feel that  the  SAP\r\n\r\nschools  have deprived  the Chinese students  of the opportunity\r\n\r\nto mix with students from the other ethnic groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, interaction can take place in other forms, and\r\n\r\nnot just be confined to the schools.  Interaction among students\r\n\r\nfrom   the  various  races  could  be  achieved  through   their\r\n\r\nneighbourhood activities or in their places  of work. We have to\r\n\r\nlook at the matter from a more comprehensive point of view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not have SAP schools in Singapore, then can we\r\n\r\nmake sure that in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nevery  school  in  Singapore, there will be  a  fixed  ratio  of\r\n\r\nstudents  from  the various ethnic groups?  I think  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible to achieve that, unless we can do like what the HDB  is\r\n\r\ndoing,  ie,  to  have this quota on the various races  in  every\r\n\r\nblock  of  flats, and have a similar quota in our schools.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  we  must  have a certain number of Malay  students  or\r\n\r\nIndian students in each school.  Is it necessary?  There may not\r\n\r\nbe  enough  Indian or Malay students from certain neighbourhoods\r\n\r\nto fill the quotas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the system of streaming has been implemented in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for many years.  Although the Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\ncan  present data to prove that  streaming has helped to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  drop-outs  among our  students  and  they  also\r\n\r\nemphasise that students from the various streams are given equal\r\n\r\ntreatment, we should nevertheless conduct a study on whether the\r\n\r\nstreaming system is beneficial or detrimental to the development\r\n\r\nof  our human resources, which is very limited in Singapore, and\r\n\r\nalso  whether  every  student  can  bring  into  full  play  his\r\n\r\npotential after 10 years of basic education.  I suggest that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education  consider abolishing  streaming  in  our\r\n\r\nprimary schools and based on the school examination results  and\r\n\r\nthe  wishes of the parents, to decide who are suitable  to  take\r\n\r\nHigher Chinese after Primary Four.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for streaming in secondary schools, I feel that the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education should review the Normal Stream course  in\r\n\r\nour  secondary  schools.  Under the present examination  system,\r\n\r\nNormal  Stream students will have to first of all pass  the  `N'\r\n\r\nlevel  examination before they are allowed to take the `O' level\r\n\r\nexamination.   I  feel that this is an unnecessary  obstacle  to\r\n\r\nthem.  Since they are promoted to Secondary Five, they can  take\r\n\r\nthe `O' level examinations, but then the four years of secondary\r\n\r\neducation  is  not  much  of a help  in  taking  the  `O'  level\r\n\r\nexaminations, because there is a large gap between the `O' level\r\n\r\nand  the  `N' level education.  So these students actually  have\r\n\r\ngreat  difficulty adapting.  It would be difficult for  them  to\r\n\r\ntake the `O' level examinations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Ministry of Education could consider abolishing\r\n\r\nthe  `N'  level examinations and let all the `N' stream students\r\n\r\ntake  five  years of secondary education and then take  the  `O'\r\n\r\nlevel  examinations, irrespective of how they fare  in  the  `O'\r\n\r\nlevel examinations.  I hope that, after 10 years of education in\r\n\r\nschool,   they  can  at  least  learn  some  basic  ability   of\r\n\r\ncomprehension  and acquire some skills in meeting  some  of  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  facing them with our move towards a  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Peh Chin Hua is not here.

I\r\n\r\nwould  like to congratulate the Ministry for its bold vision  to\r\n\r\nadapt  our  schools, our principals and our teachers to  prepare\r\n\r\nour children to face the rapidly changing world of IT.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to find out from the Minister what\r\n\r\nprogress has been made  with respect to this overall master plan\r\n\r\nto-date, and whether the Minister is satisfied with the pace  so\r\n\r\nfar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has also stated that it plans to equip the\r\n\r\nschools  with a student-computer ratio of 2:1 by the year  2002.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would like to know what ratio has been achieved to-date\r\n\r\nand  whether  we are targeted to meet this target  by  the  year\r\n\r\n2002.   In  this  regard, I would also  like  to  find  out  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's approach in the implementation of IT in our  schools.\r\n\r\nWhile  it  is  important  and  necessary  for  the  Ministry  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  how many computers each school gets and  the  various\r\n\r\nhardware  that  is  necessary to make it Internet-ready,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant that the schools are given sufficient flexibility  and\r\n\r\na free hand to implement various IT programmes within the school\r\n\r\ngiven  the hardware.  It is not appropriate for the Ministry  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  exactly what the schools should do in IT, because  IT\r\n\r\nis an area that requires a lot of creativity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the feedback that I have received from some principals\r\n\r\nand teachers, they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the  process  of IT implementation  in  schools  has\r\n\r\nsomewhat   been  very  bureaucratic  and  that  some  of   their\r\n\r\nenthusiasm  has  been stifled because of this  approach  to  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of IT in schools.  I hope that the  Minister  can\r\n\r\nlook into this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to know whether all our teachers in\r\n\r\nthe  schools  have  been trained in the pedagogical  aspects  of\r\n\r\nusing  IT  in  the  classroom, and whether the  older  teachers,\r\n\r\nespecially  those in their 50s, are able to cope  with  such  IT\r\n\r\ntraining.   Also, after receiving training, are there sufficient\r\n\r\ncomputers  in the schools, particularly in the staff rooms,  for\r\n\r\nthe  teachers to continuously hands-on with computers either  in\r\n\r\npreparation  for their classes or just to keep them  updated  on\r\n\r\nthe developments on IT?  I would like to know how many computers\r\n\r\nare  allocated  to staff rooms, whether there  is  a  particular\r\n\r\nteacher-computer  ratio  as  we have  for  the  student-computer\r\n\r\nratio.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask whether the Ministry has\r\n\r\nintroduced   computer-based  home  or  project  assignments   in\r\n\r\nschools.  I hear from some parents that this has been done,  and\r\n\r\nthat  some of these parents, especially parents who do not  have\r\n\r\ncomputers  at  home,  are fairly concerned that  their  children\r\n\r\nwould  lose  out  to  those who come from  homes  equipped  with\r\n\r\ncomputers  and therefore they feel that their children  will  be\r\n\r\naffected by such assessment as they count towards the end of the\r\n\r\nyear  examinations.   So I would like to know  whether  this  is\r\n\r\nbeing  done and, also, whether in the medium term, the  Ministry\r\n\r\nplans  to  level  this playing field whereby  they  will  assist\r\n\r\nstudents  coming from lower income families with  some  sort  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  schemes  to  also purchase  computers,  so  that  all\r\n\r\nchildren will have access to computers.  So I would like to know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Ministry  has any plans to introduce  any  finance\r\n\r\nscheme to enable this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, information\r\n\r\ntechnology  appears  to be the buzzword now.   The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation has taken great effort to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npromote  IT in schools.  I support and believe that the Ministry\r\n\r\nis  moving  in  the  right direction.   The  Ministry  has  also\r\n\r\ninvested significantly in the provision of IT infrastructure  in\r\n\r\nthe  schools  and  has also sent teachers  for  training  in  IT\r\n\r\ncourses.   On  the surface, the IT plan appears to be  flawless,\r\n\r\nbut,  in  reality,  we have to ask ourselves whether  there  are\r\n\r\nweaknesses in our attempt to promote IT in schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the key to success is to develop an IT\r\n\r\nculture in the schools and also to have IT-trained teachers  who\r\n\r\nare   able  to  nurture  our  students.   Nowadays,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nsurprising  that  even  primary  school  students  have  to   do\r\n\r\npresentations, and many of these presentations require  the  use\r\n\r\nof  information technology, including the knowledge of  computer\r\n\r\nsoftware.  It appears to be the in-thing that the teachers  will\r\n\r\nnot  just ask the school children to do their projects but  also\r\n\r\nto  present  their  projects in perhaps  PowerPoint,  MS  Office\r\n\r\nsoftware, or some other software.  This puts tremendous pressure\r\n\r\non our school children.  If the school children who have parents\r\n\r\nwho  are  familiar and conversant with the Internet and computer\r\n\r\nsoftware,  the parents may teach them the use of these softwares\r\n\r\nfor their presentation.  This, of course, will be ideal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have to ask ourselves: how many of our school\r\n\r\nchildren  have parents who use the computers and are  conversant\r\n\r\nwith computer software?  If these children do not have computers\r\n\r\nor  do  not  present  their projects in  the  proposed  software\r\n\r\nformat,  they  will feel very, very stressed and will  be  under\r\n\r\ntremendous  pressure, because many of these  projects  do  count\r\n\r\ntowards their final assessment of the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have to teach the students how to crawl before\r\n\r\nthey  can  walk,  and how to walk before they can  run.   As  we\r\n\r\nexpose our students to computers at a young age, there must be a\r\n\r\nsystematic  way  to  teach  them.   We  must  not  stifle  their\r\n\r\nenthusiasm or give them so much\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npressure  that  they want to stay away from computers.   If  the\r\n\r\nteachers  expect  the  students to use a  certain  software  for\r\n\r\npresentation, they must teach the students how to use it or even\r\n\r\nmake sure that there is access to computers for the children  to\r\n\r\nuse  it, especially since many parents are not familiar with the\r\n\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, teaching IT is not just the teaching of\r\n\r\napplication of software or the use of Internet.  I think another\r\n\r\nvery important area in the teaching of IT is also the proper use\r\n\r\nof  IT.  Let me give you an example.  A parent complained to  me\r\n\r\nthat  he  noticed that the grades of his daughter were  dropping\r\n\r\nand  getting worse.  So the first thing he did was to remove the\r\n\r\ntelephone.   But  that  did not solve the  problem  because  the\r\n\r\ndaughter was still plugged on the line via the Internet and  was\r\n\r\nspending  several hours on the computer.  So the next  thing  he\r\n\r\ndid was to remove the computer and the grades got better.  So my\r\n\r\npoint  is that, yes, we do want to encourage the use of  IT  and\r\n\r\ncomputers, but again if these tools are not used properly,  they\r\n\r\nmay  not  sometimes  help our children but  actually  make  them\r\n\r\nworse, because they use them for not very useful purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is likely that our younger teachers will\r\n\r\nprobably  be more familiar with computers.  However,  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  many of our older teachers do face difficulties  and  they\r\n\r\nfind  it  very  difficult to cope with the  changes  in  IT  and\r\n\r\ncomputer  software.   The Ministry must  do  more  to  help  the\r\n\r\nteachers help the children.  Therefore, I would like to urge the\r\n\r\nMinister  to optimise the use of hardware available by  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  our teachers are confident, conversant and comfortable  in\r\n\r\nthe  use of IT, and be in the position to lead our students into\r\n\r\nthe IT era.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, as we look ahead to\r\n\r\nachieve our vision of having a world class workforce in the 21st\r\n\r\ncentury,  we  have  to start by addressing our education  system\r\n\r\nbecause  this  is  where  attitudes, aptitudes  and  skills  are\r\n\r\ndeveloped that will last for a life time.  If we do a  good  job\r\n\r\nin establishing the right fundamentals, we will be successful\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin achieving the goal of developing the knowledge workers of the\r\n\r\nfuture.  The `Thinking School, Learning Nation' is therefore  an\r\n\r\nappropriate  programme if we are serious  about  achieving  this\r\n\r\ngoal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we need to make some structural changes to our\r\n\r\neducation  system if we are serious about moulding our  children\r\n\r\nto  be  the knowledge workers of the future.  Our current system\r\n\r\ncreates some obstacles in promoting creativity, to encourage our\r\n\r\nchildren to do things differently, to experiment and to question\r\n\r\nconventional  wisdom.  Sir, these are the same  qualities  which\r\n\r\nwill help us groom more technopreneurs and entrepreneurs in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore feel that we need to make a number of changes.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  the streaming of our children as early as  in  Primary\r\n\r\nFour  and  at  the  various levels after that, based  on  purely\r\n\r\nacademic  performance, recognises and rewards only one  category\r\n\r\nof students, those who can score well in examinations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree with the original concept of streaming which\r\n\r\nallows  students to develop at their own pace, however,  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  not been successful in achieving  the  objective\r\n\r\nbecause I believe schools actually channel the best resources to\r\n\r\nthe upper streams.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stigma for our students who are streamed to the\r\n\r\nlower  streams because of the way our system treats them.   This\r\n\r\nincludes  the teachers, parents and their peers.  I have  spoken\r\n\r\nto  a  number of parents whose children are in the upper streams\r\n\r\nor  in gifted programmes and these parents themselves fear  that\r\n\r\ntheir  children's attitude towards children of lower streams  is\r\n\r\nunhealthy.  I really fear that we are developing a class  system\r\n\r\nby  placing labels on our children starting at a very early age.\r\n\r\nI  also  recall a case of a child who was streamed to EM3.   His\r\n\r\nparents came to see me during my meet-the-people session to help\r\n\r\ntransfer  their son to an EM2 stream.  Right in front  of  their\r\n\r\nson, they told me that if their son\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nremains  in the EM3 stream, his life would be destroyed forever.\r\n\r\nI  fear  that  such attitudes will create a serious  self-esteem\r\n\r\nproblem, a sense of hopelessness and of not willing to try again\r\n\r\nfor such children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to consider the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Can we modify our school system to use non-academic\r\n\r\nmeasures  for  streaming and for promotion?  I suggest  a  large\r\n\r\nproportion of the decision criteria be based on project work and\r\n\r\nEQ measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Even if we continue with the streaming system, can we\r\n\r\nensure  that all students mix well with each other to avoid  the\r\n\r\ndrawing  of  lines?  I suggest that students  from  the  various\r\n\r\nstreams  spend at least 30% to 40% of their school time  in  the\r\n\r\nsame  class.   In  this way, they can learn to  appreciate  each\r\n\r\nother's  abilities and limitations and perhaps help  the  weaker\r\n\r\nstudents to do better because of a more conducive environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can we recognise and reward those who may not score\r\n\r\nwell  in  examinations,  but have the  other  abilities  that  I\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier in my speech?  I would like to suggest that we\r\n\r\nintroduce project work as a gradable subject where students  can\r\n\r\nuse  their  non-academic skills to do a few projects  throughout\r\n\r\nthe  year.   The grades obtained for such projects can  then  be\r\n\r\nused  to measure the performance of the student.  I believe this\r\n\r\nis practised in schools in the USA and Australia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I feel the society's attitude needs to change,\r\n\r\nour  education system too needs to transform so that we  do  not\r\n\r\npenalise  people who are not academically smart, but have  other\r\n\r\nunique qualities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, there is no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  we  are all in agreement as to the  need  for  more\r\n\r\nproject  work, the need to raise creativity among  our  students\r\n\r\nand  also to improve IT competence.  My comments are in relation\r\n\r\nto what this means for our young children today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have three issues to raise. These are conditioned by an\r\n\r\nexperience I had with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmy  son who was, at that time, in school and given a project  to\r\n\r\ndo.   It had to do with the history of the Second World War  and\r\n\r\nhe  was  trying to find out what were the causes of  the  Second\r\n\r\nWorld War.  His idea of doing this project was very simple.   He\r\n\r\nasked  me  how  many  databases I have, and  I  said  there  are\r\n\r\nMicrosoft  Encarta, Encyclopedia Britannica and  another  called\r\n\r\nGrolier  Encyclopedia.   All these are available  in  electronic\r\n\r\nform.   He  then put all of them in the computer, extracted  the\r\n\r\nvarious  parts,  did  a search for World War  II,  got  all  the\r\n\r\narticles out and he dutifully cut and pasted parts of it into  a\r\n\r\nvery nicely coloured paper which he then called his project.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was forced to ask him, \"Where is this creative\r\n\r\nelement that you are supposed to have in doing a project of this\r\n\r\nsort?\"   He  said it is creative `cut and paste'.   He  did  not\r\n\r\nbelieve in putting the whole thing in and he had to select.   So\r\n\r\nthe second question I asked him was, \"Do you know that there  is\r\n\r\na  very  fundamental value in research and, that  is,  you  must\r\n\r\nnever plagiarise?\"  He said that was a new word to him and  what\r\n\r\ndid  that mean.  The simple answer, of course, is that  you  can\r\n\r\nread  as  much as you want and you can use as many resources  as\r\n\r\nyou  have.  But part of the creative nature of study is to  make\r\n\r\nsure   that  the  materials  you  get  from  all  these  various\r\n\r\ndatabases, you can summarise, you can put it in your  own  words\r\n\r\nand  you  can  give  your  own view.  This  is  something  which\r\n\r\napparently is quite new to many of our students.  They are  very\r\n\r\ncomfortable  with  using  electronic databases  by  cutting  and\r\n\r\npasting from it, and they see no moral issue on that point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point is this. It is clearly laudable to have more\r\n\r\nproject works, raise creativity and improve IT competence.   But\r\n\r\nI  think  it  is also necessary to ensure that our teachers  are\r\n\r\nable  to  teach  in  a  way that would inculcate  good  research\r\n\r\npractices,  and we can never start too young as far as  this  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  among  our  students.   With  the  availablility  of\r\n\r\nelectronic databases, and so on, it is so easy to do research by\r\n\r\ndoing a search as it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwere  and that should not be the creative part, that should  not\r\n\r\nbe  the end-all of creativity.  So I believe that there is a lot\r\n\r\nto  be done in terms of not just student training but also staff\r\n\r\ntraining  to  monitor our students and inculcate  in  them  good\r\n\r\nresearch  values.  Also, in terms of project works, I  think  it\r\n\r\nrequires  a lot of staff supervision.  Does that mean  that  all\r\n\r\nschools  would have to increase their staff, not  just  to  make\r\n\r\nthem  more IT competent but also to increase the number of staff\r\n\r\nthat  are  available to supervise such work?   Thirdly,  project\r\n\r\nwork  takes  time.   How is that to be traded  off  against  the\r\n\r\ntraditional  studies that they have to do  at  this  time?   And\r\n\r\nfinally,  a  point that has to do with the new  proposals  about\r\n\r\ntaking  project work into account in admissions.  The evaluation\r\n\r\nof  project  work  is always an issue that has  to  be  tackled.\r\n\r\nThere are three problems here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, how do we ensure that the project work done is that\r\n\r\nof  the  students,  especially we have  huge  schools  and  huge\r\n\r\nnumbers  to contend with?  Secondly, how do we ensure a  certain\r\n\r\nsense  of commensurability among the scores between schools  and\r\n\r\nclasses  in  the nation?  Unless and until we have solved  these\r\n\r\nproblems,  it would be very good to take time and look  at  this\r\n\r\nissue,  find  how  this can be solved before  we  implement  any\r\n\r\nscheme  whereby  project work would be  taken  into  account  in\r\n\r\nadmission to our higher tertiary institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, let me declare\r\n\r\nmy  interest.  I teach at the NUS and I am also a  parent.   The\r\n\r\nsecond  factor,  parenthood,  clearly  makes  me  an  expert  on\r\n\r\neducation,  like so many of us.  And I am sure it  is  a  factor\r\n\r\nthat makes the work of the Ministry more interesting, not to say\r\n\r\ndifficult, having so many \"experts\" to answer to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seriously, Sir, I move my cut on non-classroom and\r\n\r\nproject  learning  in the context of concern  to  many  parents.\r\n\r\nThis arises because of two recent events.  First, the tragic and\r\n\r\naccidental  drowning of two students while on a school-organised\r\n\r\nouting  to  Pulau  Ubin.  Second, the injuries  and  indignation\r\n\r\nsuffered by students at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nJin Tai when a live re-creation of national education in history\r\n\r\nwent  awry.  I do not wish to discuss the particulars  of  these\r\n\r\ncases.   I  am  sure the Ministry and the school concerned  will\r\n\r\ncarry out a full investigation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish instead to point to a more general concern. Both\r\n\r\nincidents are instances of non-classroom based learning, of  new\r\n\r\nefforts to let our students learn beyond traditional reading and\r\n\r\nwriting.  Experience instead is the tool to educate these  young\r\n\r\nminds.  This, I believe, is a newer emphasis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these recent and unfortunate incidents, there may be\r\n\r\nsome,  both  in  the public and in the schools  themselves,  who\r\n\r\nmight  question if these forms of non-classroom learning  should\r\n\r\ncontinue.   Are they worth the risk, some may ask?   The  safest\r\n\r\nand  easiest  answer  will be to go back to the  classroom,  the\r\n\r\nbooks, reading and writing, and to stop these newer forms of non-classroom teaching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I would urge the Ministry and the schools and\r\n\r\nparents not to take this option.  Non-classroom learning  has  a\r\n\r\ncontinued place among the tools of the educator.  A policy  that\r\n\r\nturns  away  from  the  newer forms of  learning  would  not  be\r\n\r\ndesirable  to my mind.  Yes, safeguards are necessary and  risks\r\n\r\nshould be minimised.  But some risk is inevitable and indeed,  I\r\n\r\nwould  argue, must therefore be acceptable.  There is wisdom  in\r\n\r\nthe  old saying, \"Nothing ventured, nothing gained; no risk,  no\r\n\r\ngain.\"   I  would  therefore  urge  the  Ministry  to  steer   a\r\n\r\nconsistent  and continued path in this regard and continue  with\r\n\r\nnon-classroom  learning,  despite  these  incidents   or   other\r\n\r\ncontroversies that may arise in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On project learning, I too welcome the move. More, I hope\r\n\r\nthe Ministry will encourage such forms of learning to be done by\r\n\r\nteams   of  students  and  for  areas  that  are  beyond   their\r\n\r\ncurriculum.    Sir,  in  the  real  world,  we  are   constantly\r\n\r\nchallenged in areas and subjects that we are not experts  in  or\r\n\r\nhave not previously studied or prepared for.  When we face these\r\n\r\nchallenges, we are most often in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nteams  in  the  workplace.  In this way,  project  learning  and\r\n\r\nteamwork  would help prepare our students, our youths,  for  the\r\n\r\nreal  world that they will emerge into.  It would encourage them\r\n\r\nto  teach themselves both as individuals and within the team  in\r\n\r\nareas  that are relevant but that cannot be covered in a limited\r\n\r\nsyllabus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example of such an area for team and project learning\r\n\r\nis  about the region and the countries around us.  Sir, while we\r\n\r\nhave  a  National Education, I think that regional education  is\r\n\r\nalso  a worthwhile arena for our students to learn.  This crisis\r\n\r\nhas  taught us how interconnected we are as economies and indeed\r\n\r\nsocieties.   This  lesson needs to be learnt, not  just  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment or adults in our society, but also by our youths  and\r\n\r\nstudents.   There is a power in first-hand knowledge that  might\r\n\r\nbe  gained  from  students' visits, non-classroom  learning  and\r\n\r\ntheir   own   research  and  exchanges  with  our   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries.  Regional education may not be another subject in our\r\n\r\nsyllabus.   But  it can be a suitable subject for  non-classroom\r\n\r\nand project learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I observe that some schools  offer  a\r\n\r\nlimited  curriculum  on  home economics.   Most  of  our  girls'\r\n\r\nschools  conduct home economics classes whereas  the  top  boys'\r\n\r\nschools like Chinese High and Raffles Institution do not in  the\r\n\r\nentire  secondary  years.   ACS and Catholic  High  School,  for\r\n\r\nexample, on the other hand, have home economics at secondary one\r\n\r\nand  two levels.  The girls' schools, on the other hand, do  not\r\n\r\nteach  them  how to change light bulbs, use an electric  saw,  a\r\n\r\nscrewdriver or other simple technical skills.  Some neigbourhood\r\n\r\nschools have such classes; others do not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am speaking in my interest as a parent. Evidently, the\r\n\r\ntasks of teaching our children to cook, sew, change light bulbs,\r\n\r\nfix  and  repair household problems can be taught at home.   But\r\n\r\nthis  can be more effectively achieved if these skills could  be\r\n\r\nwoven  into the school curriculum to make their activities  seem\r\n\r\nless  of  a chore and more of a fun moment to break the monotony\r\n\r\nof  studying  in school.  This emphasis will be welcome  to  all\r\n\r\nworking  parents who can be assured that as a result  of  school\r\n\r\ntraining,  their teenagers could cook themselves a  decent  meal\r\n\r\nand attend to house-care needs when they are not around.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also propose that some hours be devoted to teaching\r\n\r\nstudents  social  etiquette, personal grooming and  presentation\r\n\r\nskills.  I feel that they form part of the growing up repertoire\r\n\r\nof  skills  for the young which, if learnt, give them a  greater\r\n\r\nsense of self-confidence in conducting themselves in public  and\r\n\r\nmaking  their ideas heard.  Some top schools have these classes;\r\n\r\nothers  do  not.   A cluster of top boys and girls  learn  these\r\n\r\nthrough debate sessions.  The success is not broad based enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I propose that the Ministry revisit this issue of\r\n\r\nteaching  our youth how to acquire life skills with  respect  to\r\n\r\nhome economics, home maintenance as well as presentation skills?\r\n\r\nI hope a higher degree of standardisation could be encouraged at\r\n\r\nall  secondary  school levels for girls and boys  to  learn  all\r\n\r\nthese skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I strongly believe that homework is\r\n\r\nan  integral  part  of our school curriculum and  that  homework\r\n\r\nhelps  in  reinforcing  the people's understanding  of  concepts\r\n\r\ntaught  in  the classroom.  I have two points to raise regarding\r\n\r\nhomework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the amount of homework. The amount of homework\r\n\r\ngiven to our pupils varies from teacher to teacher and class  to\r\n\r\nclass, and there is apparently no coordination as to how much is\r\n\r\ngiven  on  a daily basis to a particular class of pupils.   This\r\n\r\nresults in a very unbalanced homework load and the pupil has  to\r\n\r\nspend far too much time doing homework for a particular subject,\r\n\r\nand as a result, does not have sufficient time to concentrate on\r\n\r\nother subjects which may be just as important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask whether there is any Ministry\r\n\r\nguidelines  as  to how much homework is assigned to  pupils  and\r\n\r\nwhether   it  is  possible  for  principals  and  the  head   of\r\n\r\ndepartments  and  form teachers to coordinate with  the  subject\r\n\r\nteachers  the amount of homework that is given on a daily  basis\r\n\r\nso that the homework load can be balanced throughout the week.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I would like to make is that because\r\n\r\nof the heavy homework load and the high level of difficulties of\r\n\r\nsome  of this homework given, many parents actually end up doing\r\n\r\nthe   homework  for  their  children.   Indeed,  this  is   very\r\n\r\nprevalent,  and I heard many feedback on this. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nrelate  just  one  anecdote in this regard.  A  friend  told  me\r\n\r\nrecently  that his son, who is studying in Primary 5, came  back\r\n\r\nfrom school one day, feeling very dejected.  My friend asked his\r\n\r\nson  what was the problem and his son told him that his  teacher\r\n\r\nwas not impressed at all with the homework that he had submitted\r\n\r\nand the teacher actually praised the boy who was sitting next to\r\n\r\nhim for the excellent submission.  My friend's son asked the boy\r\n\r\nsitting  next  to  him  how did he do so well.   The  boy  said,\r\n\r\n\"That's  easy.  I  just  ask my father to  do  it  all  for  me.\r\n\r\nSometimes when he is busy, I would ask my tuition teacher to  do\r\n\r\nit for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nme.\"  That was the response.  My friend's son came back home and\r\n\r\nasked his father, \"How come you did not do the homework for  me?\r\n\r\nNext time I want you to do the homework for me so that I can  do\r\n\r\nwell.\"   The  point  in this anecdote is that the  children  are\r\n\r\nforming  wrong  values  and  the original  intention  of  having\r\n\r\nhomework  is  lost  and because of the difficulty,  as  what  Dr\r\n\r\nMichael Lim had earlier pointed out, children are being asked to\r\n\r\ndo  even  computer assignments at home, they find that they  are\r\n\r\nunable  to cope and as a result, more and more parents  have  to\r\n\r\nactually get involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point here is that all these defeat the very objectives\r\n\r\nof  the  homework assignments. While on the one hand,  obviously\r\n\r\nthere is a need for the Ministry to educate the parents on their\r\n\r\nrole  in helping children with their homework, more importantly,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  must take a holistic view to review  the  various\r\n\r\nissues  relating  to homework.  I hope the Minister  would  look\r\n\r\ninto this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, with the rapid rate of change, Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  become  a  nation  of  superlatives  in  many  areas.   The\r\n\r\naspirations  and expectations of Singaporeans have  also  become\r\n\r\ndifferent and in keeping with the changing times.  Life here has\r\n\r\ncertainly been good and we understand what \"comfortable\"  means.\r\n\r\nIn  the light of this, schools in Singapore also need changes to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  new  trends  and to provide  enhanced  and  conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment for our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to beseech the Ministry of Education to\r\n\r\nprovide  air-conditioning in all our schools.  We  now  consider\r\n\r\nair-conditioning  a necessity, not a luxury,  in  this  tropical\r\n\r\nclimate.    Both   students,  as  well  as  the  teachers,   can\r\n\r\nconcentrate  better and perform better in cool  classrooms.   In\r\n\r\ntime, more students will spend longer hours in the school.  Air-conditioning  will certainly help the students get  through  the\r\n\r\nhottest part of each day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost will always be of primary concern. However, if it is\r\n\r\nvalue-added and allows for better performance in our young,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nair-conditioning  school classrooms would have been  worthwhile.\r\n\r\nIt  would have been a good investment indeed.  Someone has  even\r\n\r\ncalculated  that it would cost just about one dollar  per  month\r\n\r\nper child in order to have air-conditioned classrooms.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot  much and some schools have already started air-conditioning\r\n\r\nclassrooms for privileged groups of students.  This causes  envy\r\n\r\nand  jealousy  in those deprived groups.  This is not  ideal  as\r\n\r\nuniformity  and  fairness to all should  be  our  policy.   Many\r\n\r\nschools have air-conditioned computer rooms and libraries.   The\r\n\r\nreasons  given  for  air conditioning them would  apply  to  the\r\n\r\nclassrooms equally well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we strive for excellence in our education system,\r\n\r\nlet  us  not  forget that investing in basics and  down-to-earth\r\n\r\nitems,  besides information technology may also help  us  attain\r\n\r\nour  goal.  I would urge the Ministry of Education to look  into\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the sea of learning is\r\n\r\nboundless.  But the ultimate objective of learning is to be able\r\n\r\nto cross the sea to get to the opposite bank.   The question is:\r\n\r\nwhat is the purpose of getting to the other side or the opposite\r\n\r\nbank?  Are you learning just because you want to make good money\r\n\r\nor  to  absorb  more  knowledge  to  enrich  yourself?   If  the\r\n\r\nstudents' objective is just for personal benefit, it is a  self-centred  mentality.  As a matter of fact, hidden at the opposite\r\n\r\nbank  are the precious traditional values.  If our students  can\r\n\r\nbe  bothered  to go and dig out this treasure, it  will  benefit\r\n\r\nthem for life.  It is a well that never runs dry.   The question\r\n\r\nis: how do we help our younger generation comprehend this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the classic book of Great Learning, there is a great\r\n\r\nenlightenment to us.  It says,  \"First, cultivate  the  persons;\r\n\r\nnext,  regulate the families; then rule the state.   There  will\r\n\r\nbe  peace  and harmony for the whole world.\"  I am sure  we  are\r\n\r\nvery familiar with this passage and I shall not elaborate on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to discuss with you another passage from\r\n\r\nthis  book.   It  says \"Wishing to cultivate the person,  first,\r\n\r\nrectify  the  heart.  Wishing to rectify the  heart,  first,  be\r\n\r\nsincere  in the thought.  Wishing to be sincere in the  thought,\r\n\r\nfirst,  extend  knowledge  to the  utmost.\"   This  passage  has\r\n\r\ninspired me to realise that if a person's heart is not rectified\r\n\r\nand  does  not treat others with sincerity, then no  matter  how\r\n\r\nprofound  his knowledge may be, no matter how high his  academic\r\n\r\nachievements may be, he will  not necessarily be a  blessing  to\r\n\r\nsociety, to the nation and to mankind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when we teach our students, it is not just the\r\n\r\npassing down of knowledge to enrich the mind.  More importantly,\r\n\r\nwe  should  inculcate in them the correct values, to  bring  out\r\n\r\ntheir civic-mindedness, to strengthen their moral perception  so\r\n\r\nthat  they may extend their knowledge to the utmost and seek  to\r\n\r\nbe sincere in their thoughts, rectify their hearts and cultivate\r\n\r\ntheir person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the new policy on Chinese language announced\r\n\r\nrecently by the Ministry of Education.  However, in implementing\r\n\r\nthis  new policy, the Ministry of Education and all the teachers\r\n\r\nof  the  Chinese  language need to be  aware  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndifference  between the students learning the  Chinese  language\r\n\r\nand their absorption of good traditional culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language is a bridge. It is the medium through which we\r\n\r\nabsorb  good traditions.  In other words, learning the  language\r\n\r\nto be proficient in Chinese is not the ultimate objective of our\r\n\r\nlearning the language.  For students taking Higher Chinese,  the\r\n\r\nlanguage  bridge is broader.  For those who do ordinary Chinese,\r\n\r\nthe  bridge may be narrower.  As for those who are taking  CL'B'\r\n\r\nin  the  future,  they are actually walking  on  a  single-plank\r\n\r\nbridge.   However,  they all head for the same  destination.   I\r\n\r\nhope  that when the Ministry of Education implements the  mother\r\n\r\ntongue policy, the inculcation of traditional values should  not\r\n\r\nbe  diluted.  Students from the various courses must be  allowed\r\n\r\nto go\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeep into the connotations and quintessence of their traditional\r\n\r\ncultures,   and  to  live  through  life  with  the  spirit   of\r\n\r\nselflessness, irrespective of the languages and the races.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  allowing me to respond at this point in time.  Members\r\n\r\nhave  raised  quite a number of different issues.  Allow  me  to\r\n\r\ndeal with some of them before we proceed any further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we draw all these different strands together? Last\r\n\r\nyear,   if  Members  will  recall,  the  Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\npublished   this  document  called  The  Desired   Outcomes   of\r\n\r\nEducation.  Some Members, last year, had seen it for  the  first\r\n\r\ntime.   So  I will request the Clerk to distribute this document\r\n\r\nonce  again so that Members can see it again and be reminded  of\r\n\r\nit.   [Copies  of  document distributed to hon. Members.]   This\r\n\r\ndocument  spells out the end-objectives of formal  education  as\r\n\r\nwell as the intermediate objectives of primary, secondary and JC\r\n\r\neducation.   There  was  widespread  support  for  the   Desired\r\n\r\nOutcomes  of  Education from Members of this House, the  public,\r\n\r\nparents,  principals, teachers and students.  The concern  then,\r\n\r\nas it is now, was on how we are going to achieve these outcomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two years, the Ministry of Education has\r\n\r\ninitiated  several  programmes that  will  bring  us  closer  to\r\n\r\nachieving   these  Desired  Outcomes   -   the  IT   Masterplan,\r\n\r\nNational Education, the Community Involvement Programme, COMPASS\r\n\r\nand  the  reduction in curriculum content by up to 30% that  was\r\n\r\nannounced  last year which will help us shift the focus  of  our\r\n\r\neducation  system  from  merely  acquiring  ever  more   content\r\n\r\nknowledge to creativity and thinking skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These programmes are all desirable in themselves but, more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  they all form part of a whole.  The end  objective\r\n\r\nis  re-aligning our education system more closely  to  achieving\r\n\r\nthe Desired Outcomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to draw Members' attention to another\r\n\r\naspect of the changes that we are making to the education system\r\n\r\n-    the re-alignment of the way we assess students and appraise\r\n\r\nschools.   We can introduce new programmes.  We have heard  many\r\n\r\nexhortations  today for teachers and students  to  work  towards\r\n\r\nachieving  the  Desired  Outcomes.  But unless  we  change  what\r\n\r\ncounts, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to  change\r\n\r\nthe  orientation  and  the focus of our education  system.   Our\r\n\r\nassessment systems for schools and for students must be  brought\r\n\r\nmore  closely  into  alignment  with  the  Desired  Outcomes  of\r\n\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way we assess students affects their motivations and\r\n\r\nwhat  they  and  perhaps, more importantly, their  parents  will\r\n\r\nemphasise  and  devote  their time and  effort  to.   Similarly,\r\n\r\nschools have a tendency to focus their efforts primarily on what\r\n\r\nis being measured.  The Ministry of Education has never assessed\r\n\r\nschools  purely  on the basis of their academic results  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  examinations, but there is overwhelming interest  from\r\n\r\nschools themselves, parents, teachers, the press and the general\r\n\r\npublic  on  the  academic performance of schools  and  students,\r\n\r\nbecause, in their eyes, that is practically the only thing  that\r\n\r\ncounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change behaviour, we have to change what counts - both\r\n\r\nfor  students, and for schools.  Hence, over the last  year,  we\r\n\r\nhave  reviewed the university admission system, and we have also\r\n\r\nlooked again at the way that we appraise our schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me begin with the university admissions. We\r\n\r\nwant our potential graduates not just to excel academically, but\r\n\r\nalso to demonstrate character, creativity and commitment to  the\r\n\r\nnation.   It is both timely and necessary to move the university\r\n\r\nadmission system away from a sole reliance on 'A' levels towards\r\n\r\na  more  holistic evaluation of a person's potential to  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  university  education.  This change is  not  merely  about\r\n\r\nselecting  students to go to the university.  This  change  will\r\n\r\nsend a clear signal throughout the whole education system  -   I\r\n\r\ndare say\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom  kindergarten  all the way through to 'O'  levels  and  'A'\r\n\r\nlevels  -  regarding the qualities we desire in our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee on University Admissions chaired by Prof Shih\r\n\r\nreleased its draft report in January this year.  We will have an\r\n\r\nopportunity to debate the recommendations later on.  I know some\r\n\r\nMembers are still waiting to speak on it and we can discuss this\r\n\r\nlater.   But  my  point  here is that the change  in  university\r\n\r\nadmission system should not be seen in isolation.  It should  be\r\n\r\nseen in the context of realigning the whole education system  to\r\n\r\nachieving the Desired Outcomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In parallel, we are broadening the scope of the way schools\r\n\r\nare  appraised.  We will move beyond academic grades  to  school\r\n\r\nachievements  in  other  areas that contribute  to  the  Desired\r\n\r\nOutcomes.   When  the  Desired  Outcomes  were  published,  many\r\n\r\nwondered how we were going to achieve the outcomes, how  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  measure them, since many of them are  intangible  and\r\n\r\nunquantifiable.  How can schools ascertain if they have achieved\r\n\r\nthe  Desired  Outcomes?  How would schools know  what  they  are\r\n\r\ncapable  of, and whether they have done their best?   Without  a\r\n\r\nsystem  of  measurement, principals and teachers  will  be  left\r\n\r\nwondering  just how much they have achieved, and  will  have  no\r\n\r\nmeans  of  deciding  how far they have to  go,  what  are  their\r\n\r\nweaknesses,  and where they have to improve.  May I request  the\r\n\r\nClerk  to distribute the other two pieces of paper that  I  have\r\n\r\nwith me.  [Copies of paper distributed to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education and the educational professionals\r\n\r\nhave  been  thinking this issue through in the past year.  After\r\n\r\nseveral  rounds of discussions and consultations  together  with\r\n\r\nprincipals and other professionals, we have decided to  adopt  a\r\n\r\nquality  assurance approach to school appraisal  based  on  self\r\n\r\nappraisal.    The  new  approach  looks  at  both  results   and\r\n\r\nprocesses.   The ultimate goal is not merely good  results,  but\r\n\r\nsustainability of good results.  Sound processes are  what  will\r\n\r\nassure  sustainability of results.  And the  notion  of  results\r\n\r\nthemselves has also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeen broadened to include not just academic results, but results\r\n\r\nin other activities that contribute to the Desired Outcomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-appraisal is itself a powerful process that will drive\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  our schools.  Self-appraisal  emphasises  self-evaluation  and  self-knowledge.  When  using  this  model,  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  and  his staff will ask themselves  some  fundamental\r\n\r\nquestions  about  what is going on in the school  and  what  the\r\n\r\noutcomes are.  This self questioning will prompt them to reflect\r\n\r\non  the  schools' efforts in addressing their concerns and  work\r\n\r\ntowards improvement.  The appraisal process will require schools\r\n\r\nto  continually question current practices and move them  to  be\r\n\r\nthe best they can be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This framework of self-assessment is known as the School\r\n\r\nExcellence Model.  In the diagram that Members have in front  of\r\n\r\nthem, there are nine criteria there in the model, and they  fall\r\n\r\nbroadly into two categories: Enablers and Results, each  with  a\r\n\r\nweightage  of 50%.  We can adjust this later on with experience.\r\n\r\nEnablers are concerned with processes  -  how the school is  led\r\n\r\nand  managed, how resources are deployed; while Results look  at\r\n\r\noutcomes   -   key  performance results,  staff  competence  and\r\n\r\nmorale, impact of programmes on students and  on others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worthwhile to note that under key performance\r\n\r\nresults,  we  are  still looking for academic  achievement,  ECA\r\n\r\nachievement  as well and physical fitness levels.  But  academic\r\n\r\nachievement  is only one of the many criteria in  the  appraisal\r\n\r\nmodel,  just  as cognitive outcomes are only one aspect  of  the\r\n\r\nholistic  outcomes desired of education.  In fact, most  of  the\r\n\r\nDesired  Outcomes will have to be achieved through  non-academic\r\n\r\nschool programmes, and this is reflected in the appraisal model.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linked to the School Excellence Model is an award system\r\n\r\nfor  schools.  There are three levels in this pyramid system  of\r\n\r\nawards. The base of the awards is a broad\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\none, and comprises different Achievement Awards given to schools\r\n\r\nfor  achievements  in various fields in the current  year.   The\r\n\r\nnext  higher level consists of the Sustained Achievement  Awards\r\n\r\nand Best Practices Awards which reflect the school's ability  to\r\n\r\nsustain good processes and outcomes over a number of years.   At\r\n\r\nthe  apex  will be the School Excellence Award, which recognises\r\n\r\nschools  for  overall  excellence  in  education  processes  and\r\n\r\noutcomes, sustained over many years.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no limit to the number of schools that can qualify\r\n\r\nfor  these awards. This would give the schools, the students and\r\n\r\nthe  parents an indication of where they stand and how they  can\r\n\r\nimprove.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Value-Added Awards that are presently given to schools,\r\n\r\na  point  raised  by  Mr  Hawazi, have been  most  effective  in\r\n\r\nachieving  improvement in the performance of students  and  this\r\n\r\nwill  continue.   It will be one of the Achievement  Awards  and\r\n\r\nSustained  Achievement Awards.  School ranking, as  it  is  done\r\n\r\nnow,  will also remain, as it is a useful indicator for schools.\r\n\r\nHowever, ranking by academic results will henceforth have to  be\r\n\r\nseen in the context of a number of other indicators, and not  as\r\n\r\nthe  be-all  and end-all.  This is certainly the  way  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education will look at it, and we  hope  that  the\r\n\r\npublic and parents will also look at it that way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School Excellence Model will be field tested in mid\r\n\r\n1999.  All schools will be using the model for self-appraisal in\r\n\r\nthe  year 2000.  The Ministry of Education will conduct external\r\n\r\nappraisal of schools based on this approach from 2001.   Schools\r\n\r\nwill, on average, be validated once every five  years or so, but\r\n\r\nthey  can ask to be validated more often than this if they  feel\r\n\r\nthey are ready to progress on to the next level of the pyramid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Desired Outcomes define our goals in education. We aim\r\n\r\nto  achieve these outcomes through various initiatives.  I  have\r\n\r\nlisted  them  before  - IT Masterplan, National  Education,  the\r\n\r\nCurriculum\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nReview,  a  review  of  the university admission  system  and  a\r\n\r\nquality assurance approach to school appraisal.  That is what we\r\n\r\ndo  and  how we measure it.  All these aim to develop our  young\r\n\r\nfor  life,  not  just for their schooling days; and  to  develop\r\n\r\ntheir potential to the full, not just in academic areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requires our education system to shift from an\r\n\r\nefficiency-driven to an ability-driven paradigm.  Ability-driven\r\n\r\neducation  has two thrusts - maximal development of the  talents\r\n\r\nand  abilities  of  our  young, and maximal  harnessing  of  the\r\n\r\ntalents  and abilities of all Singaporeans for the good  of  the\r\n\r\nnation and the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our present system, education is driven by the needs of\r\n\r\nthe economy.  We project manpower demands in various sectors  of\r\n\r\nthe  economy and train people to fit into jobs in those sectors.\r\n\r\nOur  economic agencies attract the investments that create jobs;\r\n\r\nour  educational institutions train Singaporeans to  fill  these\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the paradigm for a knowledge economy will be\r\n\r\ndifferent.   There are no pre-determined sets of jobs,  waiting,\r\n\r\nlike  holes to be filled by students coming out of our education\r\n\r\nsystem.  Instead, it is the collective talents and abilities  of\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans that will define the economy and what jobs and\r\n\r\nopportunities are available.  Students leaving our school system\r\n\r\nwill increasingly have to create their own opportunities.  Life-long   learning   becomes  a  necessary  part  of   opening   up\r\n\r\nopportunities  for the future. We are working hand-in-hand  with\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Manpower in this  sector.    Hence  education\r\n\r\nitself  becomes a competitive advantage in the economy.  And  to\r\n\r\nmaximise  that advantage we must consciously draw out individual\r\n\r\ntalents and develop  them to the full.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, the Ministry of Education will be shifting\r\n\r\ntowards  an approach of mass customisation.  I know this  sounds\r\n\r\nlike  a contradiction, but let me bring you an example from  the\r\n\r\ncar industry, although cars and people are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  comparable.  Nowadays, when you buy a car, you  choose  the\r\n\r\nbrand  and the model.  You can further decide the colour of  the\r\n\r\nexterior,  the  veneer of the interior, whether you  want  power\r\n\r\nwindows,  air-conditioning, what kinds of seats and so  on,  and\r\n\r\nall  within  that  same model.  The car is still  mass  produced\r\n\r\nbecause  that  is  an  efficient way of  doing  it,  but  it  is\r\n\r\ncustomised to what can best match the buyer's needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Education, the mass provision of educational resources\r\n\r\nand  opportunities  should  not stop  us  from  looking  at  the\r\n\r\npossibility of customising to individual student's aptitudes and\r\n\r\nabilities  wherever possible.  I am not here proposing  that  we\r\n\r\ngive  each child individual attention by providing him dedicated\r\n\r\ntutors  for  each  subject who will coach him  alone,  designing\r\n\r\nsyllabuses  just  for  him  and so  on.   This  is  clearly  not\r\n\r\npractical.   This  is  individualised  customisation,  not  mass\r\n\r\ncustomisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But within the limits of mass production of education\r\n\r\nservices,  we  should move some way towards  meeting  individual\r\n\r\nneeds.  If I may be allowed to use another analogy, it is like a\r\n\r\nset-lunch  menu. We used to have only one set-lunch  menu  which\r\n\r\nevery  one, regardless of his appetite or taste, was obliged  to\r\n\r\neat.  Understandably,  some  found  the  food  unappetising  and\r\n\r\nunpalatable and decided to leave the restaurant. With streaming,\r\n\r\nwhich is also a rudimentary form of mass customisation, we  have\r\n\r\na  number  of set menus to cater to different needs.   Streaming\r\n\r\nhas  been  very successful in increasing the proportion  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents  who  move  on  to higher levels  of  education.   That\r\n\r\nenables  us  to meet the needs of different groups  of  students\r\n\r\nbetter, and that is where we are today.  The next challenge  for\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry is to allow some variations in the courses in  the\r\n\r\nset menus, and to gradually expand the variations allowed within\r\n\r\nthe  resources  that  we have available.  The  Chinese  Language\r\n\r\nReview  is  a case in point.  It is a recognition that  students\r\n\r\nare  different  and  have  different  linguistic  abilities  and\r\n\r\nstrengths in different areas, and the system should try to cater\r\n\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now studying how we can adapt the system to meet the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  students better, at a systems level,  at  the  school\r\n\r\nlevel,  and  even  in  the classroom.   We  will  move  in  that\r\n\r\ndirection  over  the  coming year.  As with everything  else  in\r\n\r\neducation, it will take some years and many steps to get there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But an ability-driven system is also about maximal\r\n\r\nharnessing  of the talents and abilities of our  young.   If  we\r\n\r\nwere  to  focus solely on developing our young without grounding\r\n\r\nmoral  and  social values nor sinking their cultural  roots,  we\r\n\r\nwill   be  producing  a  generation  of  Singaporeans  with   no\r\n\r\nobligation  or commitment to serve the community, no concept  of\r\n\r\nsocial  identity and no sense of belonging to  the  nation.   We\r\n\r\nmust  inculcate  in our young a strong social conscience  and  a\r\n\r\nmindset  that sees Singapore as a home to live in, to strive  to\r\n\r\nimprove, and to defend if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Members who have expressed the view that\r\n\r\nno  child should be seen as a failure, and every child should be\r\n\r\nseen as a success.  But each child's success can be in different\r\n\r\nareas.  Everyone has his strengths; and talents and abilities in\r\n\r\ndifferent  areas can be pooled together for the overall  success\r\n\r\nof  the  nation.  We in the Ministry will continue to apply  our\r\n\r\nminds  to  see  how  we can maximally develop  and  harness  the\r\n\r\ntalents and abilities of our students.  The Ministry will do its\r\n\r\nbest  with  the  resources allocated to us.   We  will  maximise\r\n\r\neducation outcomes given our resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appreciate the many suggestions and comments from\r\n\r\nMembers.  Bringing about change in the education system  is  the\r\n\r\nwork  of  many years.  We will not see the fruits of our  labour\r\n\r\nfor  another five, perhaps ten years.  It requires a clear  idea\r\n\r\nof  where we are going, and this is encapsulated in the  Desired\r\n\r\nOutcomes  of  Education.  And it requires purposeful  change  to\r\n\r\nalign our programmes, processes, and assessment systems with the\r\n\r\nDesired Outcomes, so that what we do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin education and in the education system is focused on achieving\r\n\r\nthese goals.  I continue to look forward to support from Members\r\n\r\nof  this  House, parents and the public as we strive to  do  our\r\n\r\nbest for our young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to address some of the specific points that\r\n\r\nhave  been  raised by Members.  Mr Loh brought our attention  to\r\n\r\nthe cost of educating an individual student.  If Mr Loh were  to\r\n\r\nlook at page 218 of the Budget book, he will see that the latest\r\n\r\nnumbers  are there.  The earlier set of figures that  he  quoted\r\n\r\nwas from the FY98 Budget book which has since been revised.  The\r\n\r\nmain reason for the lower cost per student is the 10% cut in the\r\n\r\nGovernment's share of CPF and the further salary  cut.   86%  of\r\n\r\nthe  schools' budget comprises manpower cost and that is why the\r\n\r\ncost  has  come down.  For secondary schools, the cost has  gone\r\n\r\nup, however, because the number of secondary school students has\r\n\r\ncome  down.   It is the Tiger Year effect for the secondary  one\r\n\r\nstudents  this year.  But this lower spending in the  operations\r\n\r\nbudget has been more than offset by the increase in the spending\r\n\r\nin  the  development  budget, which will  also  go  towards  the\r\n\r\nstudents.  For example, all the spending on the IT Masterplan is\r\n\r\nnow counted out of the development budget.  That is a very large\r\n\r\nnumber.   I think it is about $150 million.  This year  we  have\r\n\r\nsome 39 schools under construction compared to 19 last year  and\r\n\r\n11  the  year before.  All these will eventually have  a  direct\r\n\r\nbenefit to the students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may move on, Sir, to what time school should start.\r\n\r\nFrankly, Sir, if the schools are operating single session as the\r\n\r\nsecondary schools will be from next year onwards, it  is  up  to\r\n\r\nthe schools to decide what time they want to start.  But from  a\r\n\r\npractical  point of view, I think that most schools  will  still\r\n\r\nwant  to  start  relatively early in the day for  transport  and\r\n\r\nother  reasons.  But it is a matter which the schools can decide\r\n\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may move on to some specific issues on the IT\r\n\r\nMasterplan.   We  are now into our third year of  implementation\r\n\r\nand student\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccess  to computers, levelling the playing field is really  the\r\n\r\nmain  motivation  why  we have undertaken  this  IT  Masterplan.\r\n\r\nBecause if we did not do this, then only students, children  who\r\n\r\ncome from better off homes will have computers at home, and they\r\n\r\nwould have no access to computers at home and if the schools  do\r\n\r\nnot  provide them access to computers, they would have no access\r\n\r\nto computers.  One of the main motivations for going into the IT\r\n\r\nMasterplan  in  a major way is to provide a level playing  field\r\n\r\nand  access  to all students.  More than 130 schools  have  come\r\n\r\nunder the Masterplan so far, Phases 1 and 2, and we are now onto\r\n\r\nPhase 3 where the remaining 230 schools will be coming on in the\r\n\r\nnext   two  years.   Phase  1  and  Phase  2  schools  are   now\r\n\r\nelectronically  networked school wide.   There  are  still  some\r\n\r\nlumps, as to be expected, but we are working this through.   The\r\n\r\nratio  of computers to students is now about 1:5 in the  schools\r\n\r\nthat have completed the Masterplan.  We have enough resources to\r\n\r\nmove  to  1:2.  But we want to do so only when the  schools  are\r\n\r\nready.  I am confident that the schools know what to do with the\r\n\r\ncomputers  at  the ratio of 1:5 but I am not so  confident  that\r\n\r\nthey are ready to deal with computers at the ratio of 1:2.  When\r\n\r\nschools  are ready, we will move ahead with them and  will  have\r\n\r\nsome  flexibility as to what to do with the resources  that  are\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For teachers, we are providing the schools with a ratio of\r\n\r\none  computer to every two teachers, ie, notebooks.  And we also\r\n\r\nhave  a very generous computer loan scheme for teachers so  that\r\n\r\nwe  expect  that all our teachers should be very  well  equipped\r\n\r\nwith computers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for training of teachers, 9,500 teachers have already\r\n\r\nbeen  trained under the IT Masterplan, each receiving  something\r\n\r\nlike  30  to 50 hours of workshop training.  In the next  phase,\r\n\r\nsome  13,500 teachers will be trained over the next  two  years.\r\n\r\nWe  have  about  60  senior IT instructors  in  the  Educational\r\n\r\nTechnology  Division doing this training school  by  school.   A\r\n\r\ncommon misunderstanding is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  these teachers have been trained merely to use technology,\r\n\r\nword  processing, or PowerPoint,  connecting wires, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, the IT Masterplan's main focus in training of teachers\r\n\r\nis  to train them to use IT as a tool to empower sound pedagogy,\r\n\r\nand  time-honoured  principles of teaching  children  to  think,\r\n\r\nconceptualise  and  so  on, are emphasised,  and  re-emphasised,\r\n\r\nduring  these  IT  training programmes.  Apart  from  that,  all\r\n\r\nschools also now have broadband access to Singapore One.   There\r\n\r\nare probably one or two Singapore One access points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to move on now to home economics. Home\r\n\r\neconomics incidentally is a compulsory subject for both boys and\r\n\r\ngirls  at  the lower secondary level.  Independent  schools  are\r\n\r\nindependent, and I leave it to them to decide whether they  want\r\n\r\nto do so or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to address a point raised by Mr Loh Meng\r\n\r\nSee  and  Mr  Simon Tay with regard to non-classroom activities.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  view what has happened, the unfortunate event at  Pulau\r\n\r\nUbin,  with concern.  And we deeply regret that this unfortunate\r\n\r\nincident  occurred.   The  Ministry is  now  looking  into  what\r\n\r\nactually  happened  and  we  will learn  the  lessons  and  take\r\n\r\nappropriate  measures to prevent such incidents from  recurring.\r\n\r\nWe have also looked into the recent episode at Jin Tai Secondary\r\n\r\nSchool.   I think clearly there should have been better planning\r\n\r\nand closer supervision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will take stock of the lessons learned, share\r\n\r\nthese lessons with the schools and advise them accordingly.  And\r\n\r\nwe  will continue to remind them of the importance of exercising\r\n\r\nappropriate  precautions  when  planning  and  conducting   such\r\n\r\nactivities.   But  I completely share Mr Simon  Tay's  viewpoint\r\n\r\nthat  to  over-regulate the activities that schools can organise\r\n\r\nwould  stifle initiative and diminish significantly the learning\r\n\r\nvalue of these activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, the approach that the Ministry will take is to\r\n\r\ncontinue to encourage schools to be innovative and to plan\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nactivities  that  are  meaningful and  relevant,  enriching  and\r\n\r\nchallenging.  However, safety is a primary concern and must be a\r\n\r\nkey principle in the conduct of such activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I move on now to the subject of SAP schools which\r\n\r\nseveral  Members have spoken quite strongly about.  Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  surprising that in a multi-racial and multi-lingual society\r\n\r\nlike  Singapore, with the kind of colonial history that we have,\r\n\r\nthere is such a wide range of views expressed in this House  and\r\n\r\nby  members of the public with regard to the issues of language,\r\n\r\nSAP schools, and so on.  But we must understand, as Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Lee explained the other day, where our start point was.\r\n\r\nOur  start  point was a very diverse education system  in  which\r\n\r\nthere  were  very  small numbers of very elite English  language\r\n\r\nstream schools.  But most of the population were educated  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  each  other,  separately, different  languages,  different\r\n\r\nsyllabi,  different curriculum, their own activities,  different\r\n\r\nlanguages.   The  question which we have to  ask  ourselves  is,\r\n\r\ncompared  to  that  time, are we closer as a  society?   Is  our\r\n\r\neducation  system bringing the people closer together than  what\r\n\r\nwas  before?  And I think the answer has to be a resounding yes.\r\n\r\nWhen we were faced with an education system which was as diverse\r\n\r\nas it was, there were several ways in which the Government could\r\n\r\nhave proceeded in those days.  We could have continued with  the\r\n\r\neducation  system in all its diversity - Chinese schools,  Malay\r\n\r\nschools,  Tamil  schools,  and so  on.   We  could  have  had  a\r\n\r\nbilingual education system, which was a different one, in  which\r\n\r\neach person learns his own mother tongue at first language,  and\r\n\r\nEnglish  as  a  second language, or perhaps Malay  as  a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage, and hope to bind the society that way.  Some countries\r\n\r\nhave  decided  to  go that way in the design of their  education\r\n\r\nsystem  and the selection of their language policy.  For us,  we\r\n\r\ncould have done that.  But I think we would be a different  kind\r\n\r\nof  society, a society which has got much deeper separations and\r\n\r\ncleavages than we have today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have decided to do is to unify our education\r\n\r\nsystem,  to  have  one  common  system  standard,  and  standard\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  for all the schools.  And we decided  on  a  common\r\n\r\nlanguage.  And, again, deciding on a common language  is  not  a\r\n\r\nsimple  matter.  Different countries have decided  in  different\r\n\r\nways.   We settled on English for a number of practical  reasons\r\n\r\nand,  again,  because  we are a multi-racial  and  multi-lingual\r\n\r\nsociety.   What  other language could we have settled  on  which\r\n\r\nwould  not  have  raised even more serious  concerns  among  the\r\n\r\ndifferent   communities  that  we  have  in  Singapore?    Other\r\n\r\ncountries  have  decided  in  different  ways.   Malaysia,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  has  decided on Malay as national language,  and  they\r\n\r\nhave  unified their education system around that.  But even then\r\n\r\nthere  are  outliers such as the independent Chinese schools  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  which  teach  in  a different  language  and  quite  a\r\n\r\ndifferent curriculum.  Other countries have decided in different\r\n\r\nways.   Hong  Kong, for example, as a territory, as a  SAR,  has\r\n\r\ndecided  to  go  with Cantonese as a common  language  in  their\r\n\r\nschools,  with a small number of schools allowed to continue  to\r\n\r\nteach in English.  We have decided on our way.  And I think  for\r\n\r\nus,  this is a pragmatic and a better way of proceeding with our\r\n\r\neducation system, and we unify different languages and races  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to reaffirm that our policy objective in the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  the  mother  tongue languages  is  to  have  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean study his mother tongue for as long as possible  and\r\n\r\nto  as  high  a  level as possible.  This fundamental  bilingual\r\n\r\npolicy in our education system, which has served us well,  which\r\n\r\nhas  enabled  us to unify the country, while at  the  same  time\r\n\r\nallowing  each community to feel that it has the  room  and  the\r\n\r\nspace  to  develop itself and to retain its own unique  identity\r\n\r\nand characteristics, will remain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I would like to speak on the topic\r\n\r\nof University Admissions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committee on University Admission System has\r\n\r\nrecommended\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchanges  to  the admission criteria into our local universities.\r\n\r\nIt has recommended that instead of using the sole requirement of\r\n\r\nthe  GCE  `A' Level Examinations, the new requirements  of  SAT1\r\n\r\n(Scholastic  Assessment  Test  1),  project  work   and   extra-curricular  activities be included.  The Committee has  proposed\r\n\r\nthat the new SAT1 component be implemented in the year 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to suggest that we allow more time for the teachers\r\n\r\nand  students  to  prepare  and adjust  to  the  new  university\r\n\r\nadmission criteria.  By making the change in year 2002, it means\r\n\r\nthat   this  year's  GCE  `O'  level  students  are  immediately\r\n\r\naffected.   It  is  better to start with this  year's  Secondary\r\n\r\nThree  students and thus deferring the change to year  2003.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the Minister would consider this point before deciding  on\r\n\r\nthe  date  of implementation of the revised university admission\r\n\r\ncriteria.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their study, the Committee did not allude to any\r\n\r\ninherent  weaknesses and deficiencies of the current  system  of\r\n\r\nuniversity  admission.  The public would be interested  to  know\r\n\r\nhow   the   candidates  would  be  affected  with  the   changes\r\n\r\nintroduced.   With  the  additional requirements,  would  we  be\r\n\r\nmaking  it  more difficult than before for our students  to  get\r\n\r\ninto university?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students are already occupied with a heavy workload.\r\n\r\nThey  do  not have time for other pursuits.  Will the adding  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  requirements be giving more stress to our students  in\r\n\r\nthe already highly competitive educational environment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well known for producing examination smart\r\n\r\nstudents.   The  students will take pains to  prepare  for  SAT.\r\n\r\nWill  the scores of SAT1 be any different from the GCE `A' level\r\n\r\nexamination  results?   How  do we expect  the  students  to  be\r\n\r\ndifferentiated  when comparing their GCE `A' level  results  and\r\n\r\nthe  SAT1  scores?  Even then, how can we be sure that  the  new\r\n\r\nsystem would do a better job of assessing the future performance\r\n\r\nof students?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The university is a place to enrich a student's educational\r\n\r\nexperience.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexposure to university learning helps stimulate the intellectual\r\n\r\nfaculty of students and in the training and discipline of  their\r\n\r\nminds.   It would appear that the university would benefit  most\r\n\r\nin  having the students cut out for them.  Should the university\r\n\r\nnot  take  steps in evolving the curricula content and  teaching\r\n\r\nmethodologies to bring the best in our students?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain courses require students to possess strong people\r\n\r\nand  social skills.  Should we include only students who possess\r\n\r\nsuch   skills   to  those  courses?   Should  we  capture   such\r\n\r\nrequirements?   Should  students not be  required  to  take  the\r\n\r\npsychometric tests to determine their character, personality and\r\n\r\ninterest before qualifying them for any particular course?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not better to have a class made up of students of\r\n\r\nvaried  backgrounds,  talents and  capabilities  than  one  with\r\n\r\nstudents  of similar attributes and abilities?  Would university\r\n\r\nlife be more interesting and less boring?  Sir, I really do  not\r\n\r\nhave the answers.  Perhaps the Minister can shed light on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I am glad that the Government has\r\n\r\ntaken the initiative to review the university admission criteria\r\n\r\nfor  our  local  universities so that we can keep  up  with  the\r\n\r\nchanging times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the criteria used for university admissions\r\n\r\ngreatly  affect the whole education system starting from Primary\r\n\r\nOne, and this education then drives the attitudes of our people.\r\n\r\nIf  the  system  is based on academic results alone,  as  it  is\r\n\r\npresently, then we will have an examination-orientated  approach\r\n\r\nin  our  schools.  Our whole system of education and  employment\r\n\r\nand of offering scholarships is based on an almost 100% academic\r\n\r\nmeasure  of success and as a result, our practice of meritocracy\r\n\r\nis purely based on academic achievements.  While examinations do\r\n\r\noffer a suitable benchmark to measure students' performances,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  such  a system is going to be less relevant in the  future\r\n\r\nwhere  being academically smart alone will not be sufficient  to\r\n\r\nbe  successful  in  the market place of the 21st  century.   Our\r\n\r\ncurrent system is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunfair  to  students who have other abilities  like  creativity,\r\n\r\ninnovation,  leadership  qualities  and  others  that   can   be\r\n\r\ncategorised  as EQ measures.  It is also unforgiving  to  people\r\n\r\nwho  may  have  had a transient problem resulting  in  them  not\r\n\r\nscoring very well in an examination, while they could have  done\r\n\r\nso   should   circumstances  be  better  for  them  during   the\r\n\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key recommendations of the Committee on\r\n\r\nuniversity  admission  is  to reduce  the  heavy  dependence  on\r\n\r\nacademic  measures  and to include EQ type  measures.   While  I\r\n\r\nsupport  the reduction of academic measures to 65% of the  total\r\n\r\nscore  in  determining admission to the university, I feel  that\r\n\r\nreplacing  the remainder with 25% of a reasoning test  like  the\r\n\r\nSAT  examination has merely resulted in shifting of an  academic\r\n\r\nor  examination measure from landmark examination to a new  type\r\n\r\nof  examination.  Sir, what is going to happen is that  students\r\n\r\nwill  now  spend  a  lot  of time and money  preparing  for  SAT\r\n\r\nexamination and the net effect may be negative, especially since\r\n\r\nmany  will try to do the rote learning approach as they  do  for\r\n\r\ncurrent examinations.  In fact this is already happening now, if\r\n\r\nyou  look  at  the Straits Times report in today's papers.   The\r\n\r\nSecondary  Four students are rushing to purchase SAT  assessment\r\n\r\nbooks  and enrolling themselves in classes to prepare  for  SAT.\r\n\r\nSo we have just shifted the problem from one type of examination\r\n\r\nto another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I can agree to a reasoning type of examination, I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the  overall contribution to the admission  criteria\r\n\r\nshould be much smaller than the 25% suggested.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Reduce the reasoning test contribution to a maximum of\r\n\r\n10%  of  the  total score.  In this way, the students  will  not\r\n\r\nspend too much time preparing for any one of these examinations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Add a new criterion based on continuous assessments on\r\n\r\nEQ factors like leadership, creativity, teamwork and others, and\r\n\r\nallow  these  to contribute to about 15% of the total  admission\r\n\r\ncriteria.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Allow ECA to contribute directly to the admission\r\n\r\ncriteria rather than using it just as a bonus criterion  as  was\r\n\r\nproposed  by the Committee.  Project work and ECA could together\r\n\r\ncontribute an additional 10% to the total score.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to consider this modification to what\r\n\r\nthe  Committee has proposed because I feel that we  will  better\r\n\r\nachieve the objectives established by the committee.  If it goes\r\n\r\nby what they have proposed now, I do not think they will achieve\r\n\r\ntheir desired objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chew Heng Ching is not speaking. Dr Teo\r\n\r\nHo Pin.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, in order to make sure that\r\n\r\nour  universities admit more all rounded students, we must adopt\r\n\r\na  fair  and equitable university admission system.  We need  to\r\n\r\ntrain  quality  graduates who will provide the competitive  edge\r\n\r\nfor our economy, and the \"glue\" to nation building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations as put forward by the Committee on\r\n\r\nUniversity Admission System have certain limitations as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For `A' level students, the proposed admission\r\n\r\nrequirements  do not place much emphasis on key attributes  such\r\n\r\nas   leadership,  creativity,  perseverance,  independence   and\r\n\r\nresourcefulness  qualities  of  students.   The   combined   90%\r\n\r\nweighting  of GCE `A' level and SAT requirements are essentially\r\n\r\nacademic  criteria, and thus will not make any marked difference\r\n\r\nto the present system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the proposed 10% project work and 5% ECA bonus\r\n\r\npoint  will  not  provide adequate incentives  for  students  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  their  other  abilities.  Sir, project  work  does  not\r\n\r\nprovide a good gauge of a student's ability and is difficult  to\r\n\r\nobtain a fair assessment.  Furthermore, it is difficult\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  determine whether the student does it or not.   The  use  of\r\n\r\nproject  work  will  not provide a fair and  uniform  method  of\r\n\r\nassessment  for all students thus leading to unfair  advantages.\r\n\r\nThus,  project  work should not be introduced  as  part  of  the\r\n\r\nuniversity admission system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation of a mere 5% bonus point for ECA will\r\n\r\ndrastically retard all ECA activities in schools.  In fact,  ECA\r\n\r\nprovides an excellent avenue to develop and assess the abilities\r\n\r\nof a student.  Many ECA activities, especially uniformed groups,\r\n\r\nprovide  a structured and holistic approach in allowing students\r\n\r\nto  acquire different types of skills, such as leadership,  team\r\n\r\nwork,  perseverance,  creative  thinking,  independence,  moral,\r\n\r\nphysical and other social skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me cite the example of the National Police Cadet\r\n\r\nCorps  (NPCC).  Today, we have 19,500 cadets in over  a  hundred\r\n\r\nschools  in  Singapore.  These cadets undergo a  wide  range  of\r\n\r\ntraining  ranging  from  drills, discipline,  crime  prevention,\r\n\r\ncivil  defence, water survival, to shooting and adventure camps.\r\n\r\nCadets who achieve good conduct, strong commitment, consistently\r\n\r\ngood performance, positive attitude towards learning and regular\r\n\r\nattendance  are  promoted  to  various  ranks  and  given  award\r\n\r\ncommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participation of such ECA involves time and commitment.\r\n\r\nIt  shapes the character of individual.  The achievements in ECA\r\n\r\nclearly  reflect  the  true qualities of a  student.   Thus  due\r\n\r\nrecognition  must  be  given  when  considering  the   admission\r\n\r\ncriteria  to universities.  Therefore, I would propose  that  at\r\n\r\nleast 25% of the university admission system should be allocated\r\n\r\nto ECA activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, a fair and equitable university admission\r\n\r\nsystem  would  consist  of  50%  weighting  on  GCE  `A'   level\r\n\r\nexaminations,  25%  on  SAT score and 25%  on  ECA.   This  will\r\n\r\nprovide a balance between academic abilities, aptitude and other\r\n\r\ntalents  to be considered when admitting the students  into  our\r\n\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, the admission\r\n\r\ncriteria  in  the universities are being reviewed in recognition\r\n\r\nof the fact that Singaporeans need to be creative and innovative\r\n\r\nif  the  country  is  to  stay competitive.   The  Committee  on\r\n\r\nUniversity  Admission hopes that the changes will transform  the\r\n\r\nethos and attitudes of the people towards education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not for one moment question the Committee's honest\r\n\r\nbelief in its goal.  I also recognise the limited nature of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee's  remit.   But  if  we  want  to  transform  people's\r\n\r\nphilosophy towards learning, if we want to nurture our  creative\r\n\r\nand innovative spirit, then much more needs to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ask ourselves whether we are prepared to make\r\n\r\nradical  changes first, to the education system and  second,  to\r\n\r\nthe  way  we  develop  the potential of our  scholars.   If  the\r\n\r\nobjective  is  to encourage creativity, we have to start  young.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot leave it to the time when applications are  made  for\r\n\r\nentry  to  the universities.  By then, attitudes of parents  and\r\n\r\nstudents towards education would have taken shape and it will be\r\n\r\nvery difficult to set them onto a new path of thinking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot expect, for example, that the introduction of the\r\n\r\nSAT  will cause our parents and students to suddenly re-evaluate\r\n\r\ntheir  approach to education.  And as one of the speakers before\r\n\r\nme  pointed out, today's newspaper article in the Straits  Times\r\n\r\nis  very  instructive because parents and students, if you  read\r\n\r\nthe article, look at the SAT as another form of assessment to be\r\n\r\nbeaten by coaching and mastery of assessment books.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must start young and there are two dimensions to this\r\n\r\nissue.  First, the teachers.  They must be encouraged and  given\r\n\r\ntime  to  work  with  school  children  on  issues  outside  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum.  Teachers now have to contend with a great  deal  of\r\n\r\npressure.   They  have  to  finish the syllabus  and  get  their\r\n\r\nstudents  to score so that the average grade of the school  goes\r\n\r\nup  year after year.  Where is the time or the incentive to work\r\n\r\non  the  child's creative and innovative side, on matters  which\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvital for the all round development of the individual, but which\r\n\r\nare non-examinable?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other dimension is parents who have been brought up in\r\n\r\na  social and job environment where examination and test results\r\n\r\nare  everything.  Therefore, the obsession with grades.   School\r\n\r\nchildren  now  have  very little time for  anything  other  than\r\n\r\nschool  work.   Because  of this drive for  top  marks,  working\r\n\r\nparents  have  very  little  time or incentive  to  nurture  the\r\n\r\nchild's creativity.  It will be a rare Singapore parent who will\r\n\r\nsay that he does not really care how his son or daughter does in\r\n\r\nschool  so  long  as  he develops his reasoning  and  analytical\r\n\r\nskills.   It  is  at  the end of the day all about  assessments,\r\n\r\ntests and examinations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there will always be a few, fortunately, despite the\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  who  will do well in examinations  and  have  the\r\n\r\npotential  to  be creative and innovative.  If given  the  right\r\n\r\nenvironment,  these  youngsters  will  develop  the  spirit   of\r\n\r\nenterprise  and derring-do which we all want to see flourish  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What opportunities do these few have to realise their full\r\n\r\npotential?   Let us take the example of our best and  brightest.\r\n\r\nThey  are  given scholarships to the best universities all  over\r\n\r\nthe  world  and  are  required  by  their  bonds  to  serve  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or a statutory body or the armed forces  upon  their\r\n\r\nreturn.   There  is nothing wrong with that.  It has  served  us\r\n\r\nwell.   We  need  the  brightest to  man  our  institutions  and\r\n\r\nexperience has shown that the system runs efficiently because of\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have been paying a price for this practice which is\r\n\r\nthat our top brains are not being given the best environment  to\r\n\r\nfully  develop their potential as innovators and technopreneurs.\r\n\r\nInstead,  they  are put in institutions which depend  for  their\r\n\r\neffectiveness  on hierarchy, discipline and an almost  religious\r\n\r\nadherence to rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that our scholars are discouraged from\r\n\r\nexercising discretion\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand initiative in the Government or in the armed forces.  What I\r\n\r\nam  saying  is that there is a far better environment for  their\r\n\r\nfull  potential  to  flower.  That  they  can  make  a  dramatic\r\n\r\ndifference  if they are dropped in the deep end of  the  private\r\n\r\nsector where they have to sink or swim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty we face is our small numbers. In other\r\n\r\ncountries,  for  every  top student who  goes  into  the  public\r\n\r\nservice,  you have another five, 10, 20 who go into the  private\r\n\r\nsector  and inject vibrancy into it.  We do not have the  luxury\r\n\r\nof  these numbers.  I am not suggesting that only our top brains\r\n\r\ncan  energise  the  private  sector and  therefore  sharpen  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  Many others can and have done so.  But we have\r\n\r\nto play with the odds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five to eight years of service, not many of these\r\n\r\nscholars  leave the Government or the service to which they  are\r\n\r\nbonded.  Having established their career paths, they are  likely\r\n\r\nto stay to carry on to the top.  Those who leave come out with a\r\n\r\nmindset  which has been developed in those five to  eight  years\r\n\r\nthat they have been with the Government and it is very difficult\r\n\r\nto transform the mindset of someone in his early 30s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My proposition is that we need to re-evaluate our\r\n\r\npriorities  in education as well as the system of deployment  of\r\n\r\nour  top  scholars  if  we are serious about  remaining  at  the\r\n\r\ncutting edge.  We have to decide, given our small numbers,  what\r\n\r\nwe  are prepared to sacrifice if we want an effervescent private\r\n\r\nsector  full of ideas, energy and initiative.  We need to strike\r\n\r\na new balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A change to the admission policy for the universities will\r\n\r\nnot by itself bring about a change in ethos.  We need to do much\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.28 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, first, let me declare my interest in\r\n\r\nthis  amendment.  I am a lecturer at the National University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The recent review to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimprove the university education is timely.  We are living in  a\r\n\r\nrapidly  changing  world.  Singapore is  moving  fast  into  the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based era.  We have to prepare our young to operate in\r\n\r\nsuch a future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new university admission framework was proposed in the\r\n\r\nreview.    It  widens  the  admission  system  making  it   more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive.    The   admission   framework   includes   three\r\n\r\nadditional  requirements:   the Scholastic  Achievement  Test  1\r\n\r\n(SAT1),  project  work and extracurricular  activities  for  our\r\n\r\nstudents  who  have  taken the GCE `A' level examination.   This\r\n\r\nsignals that in the future more than just academic excellence is\r\n\r\nneeded to be a university student.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the inclusion of project work and extracurricular\r\n\r\nactivities  in  the  new admission framework.   Working  on  and\r\n\r\nlearning  from  these projects, our students can  broaden  their\r\n\r\nmindset.   The  projects  will  enhance  their  creativity   and\r\n\r\nencourage innovation.  But I do not see the need to include SAT1\r\n\r\nfor  our  students who have taken the GCE `A' level examination.\r\n\r\nFirstly, SAT1 purports to test reasoning skills, something  that\r\n\r\nthe `A' level examination is said not to do as well.  Before  we\r\n\r\nask  the  students to do these additional tests, do we know  how\r\n\r\nthe  results of these two tests correlate?  Although it has been\r\n\r\nargued that these two tests measure different capabilities, what\r\n\r\nhappens  if  these sets of capabilities are strongly  correlated\r\n\r\nfor  most  of  our students?  Would it then not be  a  waste  of\r\n\r\neffort to force all our students to take SAT1?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, SAT1 is time-consuming to take. It is an\r\n\r\nadditional activity.  It will take time to prepare.  It will put\r\n\r\nmore pressure on our students and parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if we are using SAT1 to signal to our students to\r\n\r\nchange how they should study, then it is a blunt tool.  I do not\r\n\r\nsee  how  SAT1 by itself is going to change the mindset  of  our\r\n\r\nschool  students.   It  will  be  more  effective  to  make  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  changes to our education system from Primary  1.   We\r\n\r\nhave 12 good years to nurture our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, SAT1 is adopted by the US universities because\r\n\r\nthe US does not have a common national examination, like our GCE\r\n\r\n`A'  level  examination.  The SAT test is a  common  measure  to\r\n\r\ngauge  their students from various high schools using  different\r\n\r\nsyllabi.  The SAT results are used with the high school  results\r\n\r\nfor  university admission.  In fact, SAT1 and 2 together can  be\r\n\r\nsaid to take the place of the `A' level examination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, SAT1 is not cheap to take. It currently costs\r\n\r\neach  student  US$38 to take the test.  Assuming an  annual  `A'\r\n\r\nlevel  cohort  of  12,000 students, it  will  cost  a  total  of\r\n\r\nUS$456,000.  At the exchange rate of S$1.75 to US$1,  this  will\r\n\r\nwork out to some $798,000.  This assumes that each student takes\r\n\r\none  test each.  What about preparatory classes and tuition  for\r\n\r\nthe  tests?   Knowing Singapore parents, they  will  want  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to  be  very prepared, especially now  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nrequirement  for university admission.  If, say, conservatively,\r\n\r\na  quarter of the students take tuition or preparatory  classes,\r\n\r\nwith  each  paying  $500, this will work out  annually  to  $1.5\r\n\r\nmillion.   In  total,  the  SAT1  test  would  cost  parents  an\r\n\r\nadditional  $2.3  million  if SAT1 is  made  a  requirement  for\r\n\r\nadmission  to  the  local universities.  This  is  only  a  very\r\n\r\nconservative estimate of the total expenditure by parents on SAT\r\n\r\ntests if SAT1 becomes compulsory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I support the inclusion of SAT1 as a\r\n\r\nrequirement  for foreign students who have not taken  their  `A'\r\n\r\nlevel  examination.  The inclusion of SAT1 for the admission  of\r\n\r\npolytechnic and mature students who have also not taken the  `A'\r\n\r\nlevel examination is also meaningful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, I think the efforts by the universities to\r\n\r\nreview the admission framework is timely and necessary.   A  new\r\n\r\nframework will make the admission more comprehensive.   However,\r\n\r\nI  am not convinced of the necessity to require our students  to\r\n\r\ntake SAT1 in addition to the `A' level examination.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, for many Singaporeans, a\r\n\r\nuniversity  degree  is a holy grail.  So, it is  not  surprising\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  proposed changes to the university admission criteria  have\r\n\r\naroused  considerable  interest.   In  general,  I  support  the\r\n\r\nintent,  principle and purpose of this review of the  Committee.\r\n\r\nThe  broader  admission  criteria would certainly  give  a  more\r\n\r\ncomplete  picture  of the individual student's  capability,  not\r\n\r\njust  with academic results but also on their reasoning  skills,\r\n\r\ntheir  ability to conduct independent enquiries through  project\r\n\r\nwork and also through extra curricular involvement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is really over the impact the broader admission\r\n\r\ncriteria have on our students.  In our quest for a more holistic\r\n\r\nassessment  of  our students, I think we must  be  vigilant  and\r\n\r\nguard  against over-burdening them with examinations and  tests.\r\n\r\nWhether the GCE `A' level examination constitutes a 100%, 75% or\r\n\r\n50%  of  any  admission criteria, the amount of  effort  that  a\r\n\r\nstudent  will expend in preparing for the examination  would  be\r\n\r\nthe  same.   I think students will need to, and want to,  expend\r\n\r\nthat  time  on their examination in order to secure the  minimum\r\n\r\nresults required.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the introduction of SAT1 would add a qualitatively\r\n\r\ndifferent  point  in  the  assessment  criteria  for  which  the\r\n\r\nstudents  must  prepare  separately.   The  SAT  is  a  test  of\r\n\r\nreasoning skills, and it may be true that studying for the  test\r\n\r\nother than to get accustomed to its format, or taking it several\r\n\r\ntimes, is unlikely to yield much benefit.  But I think we should\r\n\r\ntry  telling that to our students and their parents.  I am quite\r\n\r\nsure  that  the  introduction of SAT1 as part of  the  admission\r\n\r\ncriteria  will  lead to the mushrooming of a whole  new  service\r\n\r\nindustry to prepare students to take SAT1 examination.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot unprecedented.  We have seen it in other parts of the world,\r\n\r\nincluding the US.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, project work, unless introduced gradually and in\r\n\r\na  manner  complementary to the existing  curriculum,  would  be\r\n\r\nreduced  to merely being another admission criteria requirement.\r\n\r\nThe cumulative effect of these changes, I fear,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmay  be  to increase the pressure on our students and  they  may\r\n\r\nadopt  a  more  jaded  attitude to  what  is  otherwise  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  change  and signal to them that  we  are  emphasising\r\n\r\ncreativity and innovation and they need to address those aspects\r\n\r\nof their talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether this important initiative could therefore\r\n\r\nbe  implemented in tandem with other measures and considerations\r\n\r\nin  order  to  mitigate the possible adverse consequences.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  could  the  system  be implemented  with  considerable\r\n\r\nflexibility?  If a student does well in GCE `A' level, but  does\r\n\r\nnot make a mark in SAT1, can the student still be considered for\r\n\r\nadmission, or vice versa?  In other words, can we use  this  new\r\n\r\nsystem   to   broaden  the  pool  of  possible   entrants   into\r\n\r\nuniversities rather than to narrow the pool?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, could we consider SAT1 requirements in terms\r\n\r\nof  a  minimum  required score for admission to university?   In\r\n\r\nother  words, we only need it as an indication of the  reasoning\r\n\r\nability  but beyond the threshold point, additional  points  may\r\n\r\nnot  be of great consequence.  The advantage of this is that  it\r\n\r\nwill  reduce the incentive for students to repeatedly  take  SAT\r\n\r\ntests in order to try and raise their scores.  In addition,  the\r\n\r\nreduction in the curriculum in junior college, which I think  is\r\n\r\nalready  under way, needs to be put in place well  before  these\r\n\r\nadditional  requirements are put in.  At the same time,  if  the\r\n\r\nteachers  are  adequately prepared to guide these  students  and\r\n\r\nhelp  them  understand better what is SAT1 test, that will  also\r\n\r\nserve the objectives of this review.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I support the principle of the review. But I do\r\n\r\nhave  some  problems with its practical impact and its potential\r\n\r\neffects  on students and I hope that the Minister would  address\r\n\r\nthese questions before finalising the implementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, may I first declare my\r\n\r\ninterest  as a member of the Law Faculty and who is involved  in\r\n\r\nthe selection process.  We have to agonise every year to take in\r\n\r\n150 law students over\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na shortlist of 500 and in this instance, I would like to say the\r\n\r\nproposal  to  include the SAT in the admission  requirement  may\r\n\r\nhave  unsettled many parents and students, though as one who  is\r\n\r\ninvolved  in the selection process, I would welcome  it  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  that  the more information one gets about  the  potential\r\n\r\nstudent,  the  more  likely it is that we  can  make  the  right\r\n\r\ndecision about admitting him or her into the university.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents and students have, for a long time now, got used to\r\n\r\nthe  idea  that  the  `A' level grades should  be  enough  as  a\r\n\r\ndeterminant of standards for admission.  The `A' level  is  seen\r\n\r\nas  a culmination of 12 years of study and Singapore may well be\r\n\r\none  of  the  few places in the world, if the new proposals  are\r\n\r\nimplemented, where both English `A' level and US SAT  tests  are\r\n\r\nadministered to gain admission into university.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the points that I would like to raise have already\r\n\r\nbeen  raised  by  my  colleague from the university  and  by  Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran.  So, I shall restrict myself to mainly three points.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that parents and students will need to be convinced  why\r\n\r\nor  how the new SAT will be helpful because there is no question\r\n\r\nthat  more  expenditure and more time will have to be  given  to\r\n\r\nthis  new test.  In this regard, I would like to mention that  I\r\n\r\nread  an  article  in  the Yale Law Journal recently  where  one\r\n\r\nprofessor, writing on admission to law school, mentioned tongue-in-cheek  that  while the SAT administration may  tell  us  that\r\n\r\npreparation  is  not very useful for the taking  of  SAT  tests,\r\n\r\nthere  are  a  large  number  of very  solvent  SAT  preparation\r\n\r\ncompanies in the United States.  The point very simply  is  that\r\n\r\nnot  only  would kiasu parents react to a new test by  requiring\r\n\r\ntheir  children to do a lot more exercises and so on, it happens\r\n\r\neverywhere where the SAT test has taken place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a proposal, before the SAT is to be\r\n\r\ntaken  into  account in terms of weightage, whether  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible now to ask students to take their SAT test but  instead\r\n\r\nof giving a weightage to it, to use it, as Mr Iswaran\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas  suggested just now, only if the students do not meet  the\r\n\r\ncut-off  point  for  `A'  level in gaining  admission  into  any\r\n\r\nfaculty.  This would give us sufficient time to monitor  over  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of 3 years how these students will do, both in terms  of\r\n\r\n`A'  level as well as in terms of SAT performance.  And with the\r\n\r\nresults  of  the  study, we may be able to see whether  the  SAT\r\n\r\nreally  does  make a real difference in terms of  admission,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  the  quality of the students we are getting,  and  in\r\n\r\nterms, more importantly, of the performance of the students once\r\n\r\nthey are in the university.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if it is found that the SAT-type test is useful\r\n\r\nand  important, it should be integrated into the junior  college\r\n\r\ncurriculum so that students do not need to sit for it separately\r\n\r\nfrom  the  usual  `A' level examination.  This  will  allow  the\r\n\r\nschools to factor in the test as part and parcel of their school\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if given time to assess the quality of the SAT in\r\n\r\nmeasuring  ability, parents and students may have an opportunity\r\n\r\nto  see  the credibility of such a test only after these studies\r\n\r\nhave been made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore end by saying that I hope that the scheme\r\n\r\nwill  be  slowly  introduced and that there  will  be  time  and\r\n\r\nopportunity for the SAT to be proven to be a very good  test  in\r\n\r\nthe admission requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nCommittee  on University Admissions has recommended  changes  to\r\n\r\nthe admission criteria for universities.  The suggestion is made\r\n\r\nbecause  in  a knowledge-economy oriented world of  tomorrow,  a\r\n\r\nuniversity graduate must have wide ranging skills, and not  just\r\n\r\nthe skill of absorbing knowledge.  The Committee also feels that\r\n\r\nthat  the new admission criteria will therefore change the broad\r\n\r\ndirection of our education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not believe that the introduction of this\r\n\r\nAmerican  style  Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)  will  help  our\r\n\r\nuniversity  students to possess extensive skills  and  cultivate\r\n\r\nthe spirit of life-long\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlearning.   First, this Scholastic Aptitude Test  evaluates  the\r\n\r\ncandidate's  comprehension  skill  and  the  ability  to   solve\r\n\r\nequivocal problems.  I think if after 12 years of education, and\r\n\r\nhaving  attained  `A' level results which  are  good  enough  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the university's admission and eligibility requirement,\r\n\r\nour  students still do not have the comprehension skill and  the\r\n\r\nability to deal with tricky problems, then there must be  either\r\n\r\nsome  big  problem  with  our education  system  or  significant\r\n\r\ndefects with the design of the examination papers.  Therefore, I\r\n\r\nthink  the Ministry should review the present education  system,\r\n\r\nrestructure  the curriculum and the way examination  papers  are\r\n\r\nset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this Scholastic Aptitude Test is another obstacle\r\n\r\nfor  the  students' admission to the university.  It  will  also\r\n\r\nbring  additional  financial burden and  mental  stress  to  our\r\n\r\nstudents  and  parents.  Examinations may serve the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nevaluating  the  students' proficiency in certain  subjects  and\r\n\r\ntheir mental capabilities.  But the evil of examination is  that\r\n\r\nwhen  students,  teachers, parents and schools  place  too  much\r\n\r\nemphasis on the examination results, it would defeat the primary\r\n\r\npurpose of education itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that we should not depend too much on examinations\r\n\r\nto  decide  whether any particular student should be  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  further his studies.  Because  education  is  a\r\n\r\nprocess  of  exerting  subtle influence  on  the  character  and\r\n\r\nthinking of our students.  So if we just use the basis  of   the\r\n\r\npass  rate  in  examinations to decide whether a school  or  our\r\n\r\neducation system is good or bad, I think it is too simplistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Scholastic Aptitude Test will become another type of\r\n\r\nexamination  in  Singapore,  a subject  to  test  our  students'\r\n\r\ncomprehension skill and their ability to solve tricky  problems.\r\n\r\nWorse  still, this is an examination which is outside the school\r\n\r\nsyllabi.    Although  some  people  say  preparation   for   SAT\r\n\r\nexaminations will not raise their score, one thing for  sure  is\r\n\r\nthat there will be a lot of American experts in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis type of SAT examinations coming here to set up schools  and\r\n\r\nclaim  that their method is the most effective one.  So, like  a\r\n\r\nswarm  of  bees,  our  parents will rush towards  these  tuition\r\n\r\nschools,  and  this will become another burden to  our  parents,\r\n\r\nteachers and students.  I think our parents will have to spend a\r\n\r\nlot of money because of this examination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this examination, no matter how many times you take the\r\n\r\nexamination,  you  can  always use the highest  score  for  your\r\n\r\nadmission  requirement. So, in our kiasu situation in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe parents and students will keep on taking the examinations in\r\n\r\norder  to improve their score, and this will increase the burden\r\n\r\nof our people.  Why should we do that?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, is SAT relevant to our national conditions?\r\n\r\nFirst,  this  examination  uses the pairing  of  two  groups  of\r\n\r\nEnglish  words to evaluate the students'  standard  of  English.\r\n\r\nTheoretically,   if   a  student  can  satisfy   the   admission\r\n\r\nrequirement, then his standard of English should have reached  a\r\n\r\ncertain  standard of proficiency.  There should not be a problem\r\n\r\ntaking  an  examination  in English.  But  using  vocabulary  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  to test students' comprehension skill and their ability\r\n\r\nof  logic  involves  a student's depth in understanding  English\r\n\r\nvocabulary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Straits Times report on 17th January, the Dean of the\r\n\r\nAmerican Education Centre in Singapore was quoted as saying that\r\n\r\nSingapore students may have difficulties in the vocabulary  part\r\n\r\nof SAT.  To students who speak mother tongue at home and English\r\n\r\nis just a medium for academic research, this examination will be\r\n\r\nan  unfair obstacle to them.  If the Ministry of Education feels\r\n\r\nthat  the  ultimate method of evaluating the effect of education\r\n\r\nis  through  the  examination system, then is  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation going to consider having some subjects like our  sense\r\n\r\nof  patriotism  in  our examinations?  Or like  in  Japan,  they\r\n\r\ntested the students' integrity when they want to go into medical\r\n\r\nschool.    I  urge  the  Ministry of  Education  to  review  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  of having  SAT in Singapore in order to  prevent  the\r\n\r\nneed for those who cannot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmake  the  grade  to go overseas to further their  studies,  and\r\n\r\nthose  who cannot afford to go overseas will be deprived of  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  go to university.  They would thus  become  the\r\n\r\nscapegoat of the new admission system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, before the recommendation that SAT\r\n\r\nshould  be  part of university admission from the year  2002  is\r\n\r\naccepted, we need to examine a number of issues carefully.  This\r\n\r\nis  especially since the SAT has become a controversial issue in\r\n\r\nthe  American  system,  which has  been  using  SAT  scores  for\r\n\r\nuniversity  or  college  admission for  several  years  already.\r\n\r\nThere  are conflicting research studies and statistics  compiled\r\n\r\nover  what  SAT actually measures and doubts cast as to  whether\r\n\r\none  can use the test to predict the future performance of  high\r\n\r\nSAT scorers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a population of 4 million people, we need to maximise\r\n\r\nour  human resources as much as possible.  We need to give  them\r\n\r\nthe opportunities to get higher education, and we should try  to\r\n\r\nhave  more  students admitted into our universities.   Following\r\n\r\nfrom this, is there really any need for SAT to be applied across\r\n\r\nthe  board? Or perhaps it might be better used as a tool to look\r\n\r\nat  those  whose 'A' level results are just below the borderline\r\n\r\nadmission  criteria for university.  The question is,  what  are\r\n\r\nthe  factors  which led to the recommendation of a weightage  of\r\n\r\n25% for SAT scores as part of university admission?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It interests me quite significantly that our colleague, Dr\r\n\r\nTeo Ho Pin, has suggested that 'A' level results should be given\r\n\r\n50%  of weightage for university admission; another 25% from SAT\r\n\r\nand 25% from ECA.  Sir, I would like to stress, that there is so\r\n\r\nmuch  to  learn at 'A' level, and ECA should not be  used  as  a\r\n\r\nmajor criterion for university admission, no matter how well  we\r\n\r\nwant to open the opportunities for our students with varied  and\r\n\r\ndifferent  talents to enter into university, and  contribute  to\r\n\r\nthe multitude of talented Singaporeans who can contribute to our\r\n\r\nprogress in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think giving ECA as much as 25% in weightage is too\r\n\r\nexcessive.  For all the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nknowledge that has to be learnt in two years at 'A' level, as  a\r\n\r\nfoundation  for  university  education,  giving  the  'A'  level\r\n\r\nresults only 50% in weightage is, to me, very imbalanced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the SAT study should also look at the wider social\r\n\r\npicture  and  determine  whether  a  system  that  prepares  all\r\n\r\nstudents  equally to sit for SAT can be put in  place.   Despite\r\n\r\nsome  studies which show that SAT coaching really does not help,\r\n\r\nI am sure we are going to see parents and students scrambling to\r\n\r\nprepare for SAT examinations and tests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do agree that we have to re-evaluate our education\r\n\r\nsystem by introducing changes, but short notices should not be a\r\n\r\nhabit  of  ours.  I would therefore agree with my Education  GPC\r\n\r\ncolleague,   Mr  Loh  Meng  See,  that  we  should   delay   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the new university admission system by another\r\n\r\nyear or two.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nspeak on freedom of speech at local universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intake of NUS and NTU including post-graduates in\r\n\r\nFY1999  is  expected to be about 25,000 and 14,900 respectively.\r\n\r\nThey  are  the  best and brightest students in  our  land.   The\r\n\r\nuniversities'  aim  is to produce graduates with  the  necessary\r\n\r\nskills and knowledge for employment, and promoting research  and\r\n\r\ninnovation.  But I am told that the universities' administration\r\n\r\nis rather strict on students when it comes to political matters.\r\n\r\nThe  environment in the universities is rather  restrictive.   I\r\n\r\nwould  urge the Minister to make the universities to  be  places\r\n\r\nwhere free expression and inquiry are possible, so as to prepare\r\n\r\nour graduates to develop the faculty of critical thinking.  I do\r\n\r\nnot  think that we should train all our graduates to be yes men.\r\n\r\nWe shall stagnate intellectually if we do so.  I think Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  have  a pool of intellectuals who can think independently.\r\n\r\nOnly then can Singapore make a quantum leap into an economy that\r\n\r\nproduces  high value added goods.  Only then can real prosperity\r\n\r\ncome  to  Singapore, rather than, like the present time, compete\r\n\r\nwith other neighbours and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe rest of the world based mainly on lowering costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, I am also told that freedom of expression is\r\n\r\ncurbed  in  our universities.   Apparently, articles printed  in\r\n\r\nstudents' magazines and in newsletters have to be vetted  before\r\n\r\nthey can be published.  Also, if political organisations in  the\r\n\r\nuniversities  want to release press statements to express  their\r\n\r\nviews on issues, those statements must first be approved by  the\r\n\r\nuniversity authorities.  I am further informed that formerly  no\r\n\r\nsuch  restrictions  were  imposed on university  students.   Why\r\n\r\nshould the situation be changed now?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, perhaps I should address Mr\r\n\r\nChiam's  point first.  NUS and NTU students are free to  express\r\n\r\nthemselves in writing in university publications and even to the\r\n\r\nmedia.  They write regularly to the press, as long as they do so\r\n\r\nin  their personal capacities, and our universities do encourage\r\n\r\nthe  students  to express themselves.  NUS and NTU also  believe\r\n\r\nthat students should be prepared to take full responsibility for\r\n\r\ntheir views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In NUS and NTU though, the students' articles that are\r\n\r\nsubmitted for publication in official student publications, such\r\n\r\nas  those  of  the  students' unions, clubs and  societies,  are\r\n\r\nperused  as  a  precaution against any legal  infringements.   I\r\n\r\nthink,  as  a  lawyer, Mr Chiam would appreciate that.   Such  a\r\n\r\nrequirement  comes from purely a legal perspective, because  the\r\n\r\nuniversity, by its statutes, becomes responsible for what occurs\r\n\r\nin  the  university  and  what is in  the  publications  of  the\r\n\r\nuniversities,  and  it is not for a desire to restrain  students\r\n\r\nfrom  freely expressing themselves.  Mr Chiam himself has spoken\r\n\r\nat the university a number of times.  So there is no question on\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you allow me, Sir, to return to the issues on university\r\n\r\nadmissions.  First, let me thank Members for their questions and\r\n\r\nsuggestions  on the university admission system (UAS).   I  know\r\n\r\nthis is a topic that is close to the hearts of many university\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprofessors, parents, teachers and students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not look at the university admission system on\r\n\r\nits  own.  As I explained earlier, we should look at it  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of the entire education system.  The recommendations  on\r\n\r\nthe  UAS should be seen in that context, and it is part  of  the\r\n\r\nlarger  changes that we are trying to put in place in the  whole\r\n\r\neducation  system,  in  the 12 years  prior  to  university,  in\r\n\r\nuniversity  and  beyond  that.  And  in  that  regard,  I  agree\r\n\r\ncompletely with Mr Loh Meng See and Mr Davinder Singh  who  have\r\n\r\nraised the same matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities are also working towards giving their\r\n\r\nundergraduates  a  broader education, within limits,  and  using\r\n\r\nopen-book  examinations  and other  things  while  they  are  in\r\n\r\nuniversity.  But the exit gate itself from the school system and\r\n\r\nthe university system has significance, because what is required\r\n\r\nof  students at this point has a great impact on the motivation,\r\n\r\nattitude  and behaviour all the way down the line.  For example,\r\n\r\nwe  are focused only on SAT, but there are other aspects to  the\r\n\r\nuniversity  admission system, eg, ECA, project work and  so  on.\r\n\r\nIf  we say that leadership, creativity and communications skills\r\n\r\nare  important,  and  yet  we do not  make  them  count  in  the\r\n\r\nuniversity admission  -  some people argue that we should  stick\r\n\r\nwith the 'A' levels and nothing else  -  if we do not make these\r\n\r\nother  things  count, then we are really sending a  signal  that\r\n\r\nnone  of these things really count.  So, I believe that if  want\r\n\r\nto make them important in the minds of students, we have to make\r\n\r\nthem count.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the same time, it is also unrealistic to expect\r\n\r\nthe  university admission system to solve all our  problems,  to\r\n\r\nchoose people who will be successful, without doubt, later on in\r\n\r\nlife  and  so forth.  Many other qualities, including character,\r\n\r\nmotivation,  perseverance in the face  of  adversity,  determine\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  their later life.  What we can do is to  hope  that\r\n\r\nwith  the  new  university admission system, to  make  the  more\r\n\r\nimportant  attributes  count.  So  while  I  do  agree  with  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit Singh\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Loh Meng See that EQ, leadership, creativity,  teamwork\r\n\r\nand  personality  are important, we should not  place  the  full\r\n\r\nburden  of  this  on  the  university admission  system.   Where\r\n\r\nrelevant,  courses such as Medicine, Law and Architecture  could\r\n\r\nstipulate aptitude tests and interviews could take into  account\r\n\r\nthings  like  commitment to the nation and so  on,  where  these\r\n\r\nthings are of particular importance.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have raised specific concerns in three areas: SAT1,\r\n\r\nECA  and  project work.  Let me first deal with the question  of\r\n\r\nbalance  among  the  different  elements.   There  is  no  magic\r\n\r\nformula.  Some US universities state the elements that  go  into\r\n\r\nadmission  decisions but do not stipulate  weights.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  in Singapore we are ready for such a system which is  not\r\n\r\ntransparent.  Most Singaporeans would still prefer a transparent\r\n\r\nsystem where the weights and criteria are clearly specified  and\r\n\r\nknown to all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin thinks ECA is not being given enough weight.\r\n\r\nI  am  glad  though that he has not suggested that all  students\r\n\r\nmust  pass  a  swimming  test  or a life  saving  course  before\r\n\r\nentering  university.  I think we are already taking a big  step\r\n\r\nby  enlarging the university admission criteria beyond just  the\r\n\r\n\"A\"  levels.  This step alone would already send a strong signal\r\n\r\non what we value in education.  Before we take any further step,\r\n\r\nit is better to let the new system run in and, as Prof. Chin has\r\n\r\nsaid,  let us evaluate what is happening and how the new  system\r\n\r\nworks.   The  Committee  chaired by  Prof.  Shih  can  certainly\r\n\r\nrevisit  the percentages, and make recommendations about  future\r\n\r\ndirections, if necessary.  I will ask them to take the  comments\r\n\r\nthat  Members  have  made  into account.   But  we  have  to  be\r\n\r\nrealistic.  If we take into account all the things that  Members\r\n\r\nhave  suggested, instead of 100%, we will probably end  up  with\r\n\r\n300% of weight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have asked what is the value of using SAT1 when we\r\n\r\nalready have the \"A\" levels.  Several Members have asked\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabout the correlation between SAT1 and \"A\" levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAT1 and the \"A\" levels measure different facets of\r\n\r\nintellectual ability which a person must possess to benefit from\r\n\r\na university education.  The \"A\" levels, being content-based and\r\n\r\nrigorous,  measure  mastery of content and  skills.   The  SAT1,\r\n\r\nwhich  relies  less on content and more on generic reasoning  in\r\n\r\nthe  verbal  and  quantitative areas, provides a  measure  of  a\r\n\r\nperson's reasoning ability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we do not have studies on Singapore, data from other\r\n\r\ncountries,  for example, US and Israel which have  studied  this\r\n\r\nmatter  extensively,  show  that a combination  of  national  or\r\n\r\nschool  examination result, and a reasoning test gives a  better\r\n\r\nprediction for university performance than either one alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin and Mr Hawazi have proposed using the SAT1 as an\r\n\r\nalternative  assessment  tool for students  who  may  have  just\r\n\r\nfallen short marginally on their \"A\" level results.  I do  agree\r\n\r\nthat if we have students who score very highly on the \"A\" levels\r\n\r\nand  very poorly on the SAT, or who score very highly on the SAT\r\n\r\nand  very poorly on the \"A\" levels, resulting in their not being\r\n\r\nable to qualify for university, we should look at these students\r\n\r\nvery carefully and try to decide why that is so and whether they\r\n\r\nmerit  a  place.   It  is  not  surprising  that  test  coaching\r\n\r\ncompanies  have  made claims of immense improvements  in  scores\r\n\r\nfrom coaching.  That is what they are in the business for.   But\r\n\r\nI  think they would also concede that it is not the coaching per\r\n\r\nse  but  the  discipline and effort needed to  study  which  are\r\n\r\nimportant.   I  am  sure  that Singaporean  students  who  apply\r\n\r\nthemselves to their work will have little to worry about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience in the US is that beyond a certain level,\r\n\r\nextra coaching and taking the test repeatedly do not improve the\r\n\r\nscore.  I think Singaporean students will learn that also  quite\r\n\r\nquickly.  A certain amount of preparation for the SAT1 though is\r\n\r\nneeded, but primarily to become\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with the test format.  Obviously, if you do not,  when\r\n\r\nyou  walk into a test, you do not know what you are going to  be\r\n\r\ntested  on and you have never seen such a paper before, you  may\r\n\r\nnot  do  very well.  But once you have acquired some familiarity\r\n\r\nwith  the test format, further practice and repetition will  not\r\n\r\ncause  scores  to go up dramatically.  So what  we  are  talking\r\n\r\nabout  is not two years of study in the JC to prepare for  SAT1,\r\n\r\nbut at most several weeks of preparation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan also talks about the cost of taking a SAT1 and he\r\n\r\nwent  through  some very impressive calculations for  this.   In\r\n\r\ntruth,  the cost of taking a SAT1 is about US$38, ie, S$65,  and\r\n\r\nthe  cost of taking one \"A\" level subject is about S$70.   Those\r\n\r\nare the comparable costs that we are talking about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has expressed concern about how the SAT1\r\n\r\nmight  be  culturally biased and disadvantage  those  from  non-English speaking homes.  This is a valid concern which has  also\r\n\r\nbeen  expressed by some parents and students.  The Ministry will\r\n\r\nlook  into setting up our own reasoning test, but this will take\r\n\r\ntime.   Sweden  and Israel took many years to set up  their  own\r\n\r\nversion  of  SAT.   The  SAT1  would  appear  to  be  the   most\r\n\r\ninternationally  recognised  and  accepted  test  for  assessing\r\n\r\nreasoning  skills.   Therefore, the  Committee  has  decided  to\r\n\r\nrecommend the use of SAT1 for this purpose.  Proceeding with the\r\n\r\nSAT1 in the meantime will give us the experience and help us  in\r\n\r\ndevising our own reasoning test in due course.  In addition, our\r\n\r\nuniversity  graduates and JC students have often been criticised\r\n\r\nfor  not  reading widely and not reading beyond their  textbooks\r\n\r\nand  so on.  If having to take the SAT1 will cause them to start\r\n\r\nreading  more widely from a younger age, it is not  such  a  bad\r\n\r\nthing after all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, there is no perfect test which will allow us to\r\n\r\nmeasure  all  the desired qualities we want in our  young,  from\r\n\r\nintellectual curiosity to leadership and creativity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECAs have been an integral part of our education system for\r\n\r\na  long  time.  I am sure many Members here will attest  to  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  active participation in ECA, among them  Mr  Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh and Dr Teo Ho Pin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is how much ECAs should count for. We are making\r\n\r\nthem  count  now.  Having deliberated on it for some  time,  the\r\n\r\nCommittee has chosen the route of bonus points, as it strikes  a\r\n\r\ngood balance between encouraging students to strive for not just\r\n\r\npassive  participation  in ECAs but quality  participation,  and\r\n\r\nsending a signal that academic potential and achievement,  while\r\n\r\nimportant for university studies, are not the be-all and end-all\r\n\r\nof  education.  The bonus points, despite being called  \"bonus\",\r\n\r\ndo  count  because  a student with bonus points  would  be  more\r\n\r\nfavourably placed than one without.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has suggested doing away with the project\r\n\r\ncomponent  due  to difficulties in assessment.  Prof.  Chin  has\r\n\r\nalso  commented  on  this.  Project work is very  beneficial  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping    independent    learning,    critical     thinking,\r\n\r\nresourcefulness, teamwork and so on.  As someone  said,  in  the\r\n\r\nnormal working environment, if you are assigned a piece of work,\r\n\r\nthe  natural  tendency is to go and ask your colleagues  and  so\r\n\r\nforth  how  to  do it and to work together.  But in  the  school\r\n\r\nsystem,  that is described as cheating.  We do want to encourage\r\n\r\nstudents to work together and to learn how to work together.  So\r\n\r\nif we think that this is important and we do want students to do\r\n\r\nthat,  and we want to ask the schools to spend some time guiding\r\n\r\nthe  students in doing project work properly, as Prof. Chin  has\r\n\r\npointed out, then we should try and make project work count.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that there are some difficulties, but this  sort  of\r\n\r\nassessment is not new to our schools.  We have various forms  of\r\n\r\nopen-ended  assessment already.  In fact,  there  are  some  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevel  subjects  which  depend  on  project  work  for  a   very\r\n\r\nsignificant   proportion  of  their  assessment,  for   example,\r\n\r\nComputer  Studies.   Essays are also marked  subjectively.   But\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  way  of devising a reliable system  for  assessing\r\n\r\nstudents.  So examiners can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndevise  ways to grade the students in project work consistently.\r\n\r\nThrough regular interaction between teacher and student as  well\r\n\r\nas  oral  presentations, we should be able to develop  a  system\r\n\r\nwhich is sufficient to actually assess the students' work.   But\r\n\r\nwe are giving ourselves a little more time to do that and we are\r\n\r\ntalking  about  introducing it in  the  year  2004.   Given  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  to  be  gained, we should find workable  solutions  to\r\n\r\nusing  project  work as one of the  means of  assessment  rather\r\n\r\nthan abandoning the idea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has recommended that the universities, JCs\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministry  of  Education set up a  joint  committee  to\r\n\r\nmonitor standards across all the schools.  This would be similar\r\n\r\nto  the  practice  in universities of having external  examiners\r\n\r\nassess a sample of students' work.  This is one possibility that\r\n\r\nthe Ministry will look into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are putting in place fairly major changes to the\r\n\r\nuniversity  admission  system.  Students, teachers  and  parents\r\n\r\nwill need time to adjust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members' comments and suggestions will form part of the\r\n\r\nwider  feedback  that the University Admission System  Committee\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to study carefully over the next two  months  as\r\n\r\nthey  review and refine their proposals.  I expect the Committee\r\n\r\nto  submit its final report to the Government by the end of May,\r\n\r\nfollowing  which  the  Ministry of  Education  would  study  the\r\n\r\nproposals and put up its recommendations to the Government.   An\r\n\r\nannouncement  on  the  new  university admission  system  should\r\n\r\ntherefore be expected by the middle of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See and Mr Hawazi have expressed some concern\r\n\r\nthat  the  year 2002 is too early to implement the new admission\r\n\r\nsystem.   One idea for the Committee to consider is whether  the\r\n\r\nnew admission system should be implemented from 2003, instead of\r\n\r\n2002.  This would allow the students entering the first year  of\r\n\r\nJC  and in particular those doing the three-year Pre-U course in\r\n\r\nthe  centralised institutes a little more time  to  prepare  and\r\n\r\nadjust.  The Ministry will certainly consult\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Committee, the JCs and the CIs on this matter and  we  will\r\n\r\nannounce our decision in June.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the University Admission System Committee has\r\n\r\nadopted  the  right approach in its review and I  support  their\r\n\r\nproposals.  There is no perfect criterion or measurement  of  an\r\n\r\nindividual's  ability or aptitude to succeed at  university  or,\r\n\r\nfor  that  matter,   to succeed in life.  The  main  reason  for\r\n\r\nrevising  the admission system is not that we have been terribly\r\n\r\nwrong  in  selecting  students so far.  By and  large,  we  have\r\n\r\nselected   students  to  enter  university  quite   well.    Our\r\n\r\nuniversities will still continue to take in a large majority  of\r\n\r\n\"A\" level graduates.  The new system, in fact, will by and large\r\n\r\nadmit  the same students as under the existing system, but  with\r\n\r\nadditional  flexibility to take in those with the  aptitude  for\r\n\r\nuniversity education who might not have been selected purely  on\r\n\r\nthe basis of \"A\" level results.   From the way I look at it,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  that  we are creating extra obstacles, as some  Members\r\n\r\nhave  expressed  the  view,  but  that  we  are  providing  more\r\n\r\nopportunities  and a wider way of assessing students.   But  the\r\n\r\nmost important function of the new admission system lies in  the\r\n\r\nsignal it would send throughout the education system, and to the\r\n\r\nrest of society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, I must stress, I am not talking just about the\r\n\r\nSAT1 but the ECA, project work part in the admission system.  We\r\n\r\nshould  look at it from the whole package.  As the International\r\n\r\nAcademic Advisory Panel for the universities has put it,  having\r\n\r\nthe \"A\" levels as the sole admission criteria trains students to\r\n\r\novercome  only one type of obstacle.  Having other  requirements\r\n\r\nwould  signal  to  our students that they should  develop  other\r\n\r\nqualities and skills necessary for their individual as  well  as\r\n\r\nour national success in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, we are pursuing a two-pronged\r\n\r\napproach.   We  want to implement a university admission  system\r\n\r\nthat   gives   the  appropriate  signal  for  holistic   student\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  our schools.  We also want  to  strive  towards\r\n\r\n\"Thinking Schools\" and the \"Desired\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOutcomes of Education\" in the way that teaching and learning are\r\n\r\ncarried  out  in  our  schools  and  universities.   With   this\r\n\r\nstrategy, we hope to cultivate a climate that would allow us  to\r\n\r\nbring out the best in our students, so that they would not  just\r\n\r\nbe  prepared to tackle an examination, but be ready to adapt and\r\n\r\ndo well in a rapidly changing society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I move on, I forgot to mention this to the other\r\n\r\nMembers who have raised a variety of points.  We would take into\r\n\r\naccount the points raised by Mr Loh on music, Mdm Claire  Chiang\r\n\r\non  community  involvement, Mr Shriniwas Rai  on  community  and\r\n\r\nbusiness   support   for  schools,  Mr  Hawazi   on   enrichment\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  Mr  Sinnakaruppan and  Mr  Simon  Tay  on  regional\r\n\r\neducation  and other points and suggestions raised thus  far  by\r\n\r\nMembers.   Other  points  on teachers  and  air-conditioning  of\r\n\r\nschools, we will deal with them later, if we have time.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to\r\n\r\nseek clarification from the Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered my\r\n\r\nearlier  question on streaming.

I did not quite understand the first\r\n\r\npoint on streaming.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I raised a question on streaming\r\n\r\nearlier which I think was not answered.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> First of all, on the cultural content\r\n\r\nof  SAT, I think we do recognise that there may well be a little\r\n\r\nbit  of  cultural  bias, in a sense.  But I am really  a  little\r\n\r\nsurprised  with  the arguments that Mr Low is raising.   Earlier\r\n\r\non,  he said that actually our students should be well prepared,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  they proceeded all the way to the `A' levels,  they\r\n\r\nreally  should  have no difficulties doing this.   Now  I  am  a\r\n\r\nlittle  surprised  because he is taking the other  side  of  the\r\n\r\nargument to say that they do have difficulties.  I am not really\r\n\r\nsure what Mr Low is trying to say.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do accept that there are some culturally biased elements\r\n\r\nin  the SAT, but I do not think that they would be so serious as\r\n\r\nto  cause  the SAT to be invalidated.  And I think this  is  the\r\n\r\npoint which Mr Low himself agrees with.  Because he said earlier\r\n\r\nthat  if  we  do  teach our students well in  the  12  years  of\r\n\r\neducation and through JC, they should have no difficulty  taking\r\n\r\nthe SAT.

I   think  the  Minister  missed   my   point   or\r\n\r\nmisunderstood me.  I said that, in theory, because we are  using\r\n\r\nEnglish as a medium of instruction, the students should not have\r\n\r\ndifficulty in understanding the language of the SAT1.   But  the\r\n\r\nlanguage part where it tests the reasoning of students by  using\r\n\r\npairing  of  words  in English, some of these  words  are  quite\r\n\r\ndifficult  even for English-educated students.  I think  it  was\r\n\r\nmentioned in the feedback by a number of takers, which  appeared\r\n\r\nin the Straits Times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question here is, yes, you do have sufficient working\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  English and it is sufficient  as  a  tool  to  do\r\n\r\nacademic  research, but do you have a depth in the  language  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  different pairs of words that are  designed  to\r\n\r\ntest  the  reasoning?  I think it is more than just the language\r\n\r\nstandard that we are expected here.  As pointed out by the  Dean\r\n\r\nof  the  American School here, the language can  be  a  problem.\r\n\r\nBecause the depth of the language here, generally speaking, may\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  be the same as that in America and Britain where they speak\r\n\r\nEnglish as a mother tongue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I am quite confident that\r\n\r\nstudents will be able to manage.  We basically already  have  an\r\n\r\nEnglish language based education system.  Our students take most\r\n\r\nof  the  subjects  in  the  English language  for  12  years  of\r\n\r\neducation.  And we do want our students to read widely.   We  do\r\n\r\nencourage  them  to  do so.  As a matter of fact,  many  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents  of all academic aptitudes and abilities take  the  SAT\r\n\r\nand  do  quite well.  Many of them, after having taken the  SAT,\r\n\r\ngained admission to US universities.  So I do not really see the\r\n\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of `A' levels and extra stress and so forth, I\r\n\r\nthink  there  is  a balance here to be struck.  Today,  the  `A'\r\n\r\nlevel  examination  is a very high stress process.   It  is  one\r\n\r\nthrow  of  the  dice.   You  take  the  examination  once,   and\r\n\r\neverything depends on that examination.  If you want to take  it\r\n\r\nagain,  or  if you do not do well enough, you have to wait  till\r\n\r\nthe next year to take it again.  With the SAT, what has happened\r\n\r\nbasically  is  that there is a wider balance  in  the  selection\r\n\r\ncriteria.  In effect, what has happened is that the weightage to\r\n\r\nthe  `A'  levels  has declined in comparison to  all  the  other\r\n\r\nfactors in the university admission system.  The SAT, of course,\r\n\r\nlike  any test you take, will have some element of stress.   But\r\n\r\nbecause the SAT is a test which can be taken a number of  times,\r\n\r\nit  does not have the quality of a one throw of the dice, as the\r\n\r\n`A' level has today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you look at it overall, yes, you could say that there\r\n\r\nis  a  balance there.  But it is not clear that it will increase\r\n\r\nthe  stress  level  and  so on, for the students.   There  is  a\r\n\r\nbalance to be struck.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I think the Minister would do\r\n\r\nwell  to  summarise exactly what is the signal and ability  that\r\n\r\nSAT  tries  to  achieve, and what signal would it  send  to  the\r\n\r\nparents, teachers and students.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low Thia Khiang, we are going a little\r\n\r\nout of the topic.

We  are\r\n\r\npressing for time.  We have to move on.  Mr Loh.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I wish to speak on the training and\r\n\r\ndevelopment of principals and teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the rapidly changing work, learning and living\r\n\r\nenvironment, there is the urgency for principals and teachers to\r\n\r\nbe  well  prepared to guide our students adequately through  the\r\n\r\neducational system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent incidents of the Pulau Ubin tragedy and Jin Tai\r\n\r\nSchool suggest that our principals and teachers are still not up\r\n\r\nto  the  mark.  They need training in new skill areas to  manage\r\n\r\nbetter in the changing school environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Ministry may review the role of NIE and\r\n\r\nrestructure  the overall training institutions of the  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry  and  to  provide in-service training to  the  existing\r\n\r\nteachers.   The Minister could perhaps give us a  brief  of  any\r\n\r\npotential changes that will be taking place in that regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many new teachers are being recruited in recent and coming\r\n\r\nyears.  They are young and energetic and may bring in fresh  new\r\n\r\nideas to the schools.  How do we ensure that their enthusiasm is\r\n\r\nnot  inhibited  by the time they are posted to the  school?   We\r\n\r\nshould  take pains to induct the new teachers properly  so  that\r\n\r\nthe transition from NIE to the school is smooth and welcoming to\r\n\r\nthe new teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to pay careful attention to the posting of\r\n\r\nright  teachers  to  the right schools.   We  should  blend  the\r\n\r\nteachers  to  make  them  into  strong  effective  teams.    Any\r\n\r\nreshuffling and re-deployment of principals and teachers  should\r\n\r\nbe  handled  sensitively  so as not to disrupt  and  affect  the\r\n\r\nmorale  of  the  whole  school.   Though  it  is  important   to\r\n\r\ninstitutionalise  the  school  system  and  not  to  allow   the\r\n\r\n`cultist'\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nphenomenon  to  take place, it is important to  appreciate  that\r\n\r\nevery  school  has  its peculiar traditions  and  character.  We\r\n\r\nshould allow our schools to develop a distinct identity of their\r\n\r\nown  with  local variations to be in sync with the neighbourhood\r\n\r\nand the community to which they belong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience is a very valuable asset in teaching. I sense\r\n\r\nthat  older teachers are leaving service prematurely and  opting\r\n\r\nfor  early  retirement.  I would equate age  with  maturity  and\r\n\r\nwisdom,  and  certainly we need many more wise teachers  in  our\r\n\r\nschools.   How can we encourage the very good ones to  serve  as\r\n\r\nlong  as possible?  Are there ways to engage the senior teachers\r\n\r\nin roles and capacities where they can continue to make valuable\r\n\r\ncontributions to the schools?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have many teachers who have contributed long, loyal\r\n\r\nand  faithful  service to our schools.  Have we forgotten  about\r\n\r\ntheir  training  and development needs?  Do we  have  an  active\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  in-service training?  Are the NIE facilities  and\r\n\r\nresources   fully   tapped  for  the  long-term   training   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our principals and teachers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recognition and reward system is a powerful means to\r\n\r\ndirect  and encourage a person's behaviour and work performance.\r\n\r\nIf  we were to encourage principals and teachers to be good role\r\n\r\nmodels  in  life  long  learning,  a  credit  system  should  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped  to encourage and recognise them for their efforts  in\r\n\r\nself-learning and development.  The main beneficiaries  will  be\r\n\r\nour  students.   I hope to have the Minister's comments  on  the\r\n\r\npoints I have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, I wish to focus on the specific topic of\r\n\r\nteacher training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years we have seen a number of fundamental\r\n\r\nchanges  in  our  education system in terms  of  focus  and  new\r\n\r\ninitiatives,  including  IT, National Education  and  creativity\r\n\r\nbeing  some  of the focal points.  This, to me, underscores  the\r\n\r\nimportance of our teachers being dynamic and up-to-date not just\r\n\r\nin their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nknowledge but also in their pedagogic techniques and methods  in\r\n\r\norder  to  keep up with the latest developments in their  field.\r\n\r\nThis  again  reinforces  the need for  continuous  training  and\r\n\r\nlearning by teachers in as much as we stress it for our  workers\r\n\r\nand students as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know there are training requirements at key\r\n\r\nmilestone  points  in  the teachers'  career  at  the  point  of\r\n\r\nrecruitment, the NIE programme and also when they are  about  to\r\n\r\nbecome HODs (Heads of Department) or when they eventually become\r\n\r\nprincipals or vice-principals.  However, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister   what   other  in-service  training   programmes   and\r\n\r\nfacilities   exist   to  complement  these  milestone   training\r\n\r\nrequirements.  In particular, are there facilities or programmes\r\n\r\nin  place  for  teachers to, for example, learn about  the  best\r\n\r\npractices  in school administration or to learn more  about  new\r\n\r\ninitiatives in pedagogic techniques, or even to just share their\r\n\r\nown experiences in professional circles.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister whether it is a\r\n\r\npolicy  or  a  kind of administrative requirement that  teachers\r\n\r\nspend at least two weeks in a year - that would be approximately\r\n\r\n4%  of their time in a year - in training for themselves.   This\r\n\r\nis  roughly  the  norm  that is used in the  private  sector  or\r\n\r\nbusiness  circles.   I  am curious whether  a  similar  norm  is\r\n\r\nadopted in the education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, 30 years ago, I was\r\n\r\nstudying in Primary One.  In those days, a rainy day will  bring\r\n\r\nme  and  my classmates extra delight because we would be happily\r\n\r\nmoving  our desks and chairs from one corner to another  corner,\r\n\r\nwhere the roof was not leaking, and we would move our desks  and\r\n\r\nchairs  there.  This was because the roof of my alma  mater  was\r\n\r\nmade  of  attap  leaves.  In the last 30 years we have  achieved\r\n\r\nremarkable   economic development.  Today,  I  was  told  by  my\r\n\r\ncontractor friend that roofs of our school buildings are made of\r\n\r\ntitanium, a precious metal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very pleased to note that our students are\r\n\r\nreceiving good education in beautiful country-club-like premises\r\n\r\nand  serene  environment.   However, education  is  an  on-going\r\n\r\n\"heartware\" engineering project. It involves heavy investment in\r\n\r\nhuman resources.   Investment in software (Teacher Training)  is\r\n\r\nmore important than investment in hardware (Building).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry of Education would place more\r\n\r\nemphasis on the  strengthening of our teacher-training programme\r\n\r\nand  the  development  of  curriculum.   More  funds  should  be\r\n\r\nallocated to fortify our curriculum  packages,   and enhance the\r\n\r\nefficacy  of  pedagogy.   Provide more training  and  retraining\r\n\r\nopportunities for our teachers.  This will be beneficial to  the\r\n\r\nstudents who are the future masters of our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K.</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Wong):</b> Sir, thank you very much for giving me a chance to come\r\n\r\nin  at  this point.  I have been waiting the whole afternoon  to\r\n\r\nspeak on teacher training because teacher training is absolutely\r\n\r\ncrucial  to  all  the wonderful things that we talk  about,  the\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the  education system and the  desired  outcome  of\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the last few speakers for raising\r\n\r\nthis  matter as well as some earlier speakers, including Dr  Tan\r\n\r\nBoon  Wan,  on  the  importance of  teacher  training.   Indeed,\r\n\r\nwhether we are able to achieve our Desired Outcomes of Education\r\n\r\ndepends  critically  on teachers in schools  and  to  meet  this\r\n\r\nchallenge, the Education Service needs to recruit its fair share\r\n\r\nof good people and train them to do the job well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the House a little bit about the\r\n\r\nnature  and  size  of the challenge that the  Education  Service\r\n\r\nfaces.   Currently,  the  Education Service  has  nearly  24,000\r\n\r\nteachers.   To  maintain the current staffing  position,  it  is\r\n\r\nestimated  that  MOE would need to recruit an average  of  2,000\r\n\r\nteachers  annually  over  the next 10 years  to  compensate  for\r\n\r\nretirement and attrition.  The more teachers we can recruit, the\r\n\r\nmore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresources we can give to our schools.  The Ministry has  stepped\r\n\r\nup  its  recruitment efforts over the past two years.  For  both\r\n\r\nthe 1997 and 1998 recruitment cycle, we recruited an average  of\r\n\r\nabout  2,000 teachers.  These are significantly higher than  the\r\n\r\n1,000 we were averaging between 1994 and 1996.  After accounting\r\n\r\nfor  retirement  and resignations, the net increase  in  teacher\r\n\r\nstrength in the last two years averaged 650 per year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have plans to recruit 3,000 teachers over the next two\r\n\r\nyears.  This represents a stepping up of recruitment by 50% over\r\n\r\nthe  regular  annual intake.  We are making good  progress.   We\r\n\r\nhave had lawyers, accountants and engineers joining the teaching\r\n\r\nprofession and many of them, after they have started teaching in\r\n\r\nthe schools, tell us they find the job immensely challenging and\r\n\r\nsatisfying.  We certainly hope that as many of them as  possible\r\n\r\nwill continue to stay with us even when the economy recovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demands on our teachers today are very great. In\r\n\r\nrecruiting new teachers into the Education Service, we not  only\r\n\r\nhave  to  look  at the academic credentials, but  also  have  to\r\n\r\nassess  their  aptitude  and interest  for  teaching  and  other\r\n\r\nfactors,  such as character, personality and values.   It  would\r\n\r\nnot  be  realistic  for  MOE to aim to  recruit  only  from  the\r\n\r\ngraduate  pool.   NUS  and  NTU currently  produce  about  9,000\r\n\r\ngraduates each year.  As it is, MOE is already recruiting  about\r\n\r\n1,000 graduates each year.  This is about one out of every  nine\r\n\r\ngraduates.  If we recruit only from the graduate pool, it  would\r\n\r\nmean  2,000  out  of 9,000 graduates, or one out  of  every  4.5\r\n\r\ngraduates.  This would drain the other sectors of the economy of\r\n\r\ngraduate manpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we must have teachers of sufficiently\r\n\r\nhigh   academic  qualifications  so  as  to  uphold   the   high\r\n\r\nprofessional standard of our teachers as well as their  standing\r\n\r\nin  the eyes of the parents and the community.  MOE's target  is\r\n\r\nto  recruit teachers from the top one third of each cohort.   We\r\n\r\nneed to set a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntarget  so  that our teachers have standing, as I  said  before,\r\n\r\nwith  the students, parents and the wider community.  This means\r\n\r\nthat we will be recruiting from the university graduates and `A'\r\n\r\nlevel  holders  pool  and the academically stronger  polytechnic\r\n\r\ndiploma  holders.   This would enable us  to  strike  the  right\r\n\r\nbalance  between minimum qualification and what is realistically\r\n\r\nachieveable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of academic credentials, MOE looks at the\r\n\r\napplicant's  aptitude  and interest in teaching,  communications\r\n\r\nskills and values, and so on.  These are important attributes as\r\n\r\nteachers  are  the  role  models for their  students.   We  have\r\n\r\nmaintained  stringent selection criteria in spite of the  larger\r\n\r\nintakes over the last few years.  For example, last year,  1998,\r\n\r\nout of 4,000 graduates who applied, only 1,600 were selected, of\r\n\r\nwhom  about  1,100 eventually took up our offer of  appointment.\r\n\r\nHowever,  recruiting  good people is  only  the  first  step  to\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  quality Education Service.  We have to  equip  them\r\n\r\nwith the right skills, values and attitudes required of teachers\r\n\r\nin  Thinking  Schools.  Teacher training  is  therefore  a  very\r\n\r\ncritical  node  in our entire education system  and  crucial  in\r\n\r\nrealising our vision of a Learning Nation also.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March last year, I chaired a committee comprising senior\r\n\r\nMOE  and NIE officials to carry out a fundamental review of  the\r\n\r\nteacher  training system.  The objective of this review  was  to\r\n\r\nbetter  prepare teachers to meet future challenges in the  light\r\n\r\nof  changes taking place in our education system.  The Committee\r\n\r\nhas  now  completed  its  work.  Its recommendations  have  been\r\n\r\naccepted  by the Ministry and will be gradually introduced  this\r\n\r\nyear.   I do not intend to go into the detailed recommendations,\r\n\r\nbut  will instead outline the broad directions proposed  by  the\r\n\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would first like to highlight two key challenges that\r\n\r\nour  teachers are facing, given the changes taking place in  our\r\n\r\neducation system.  First, our teachers need to cope with  a  new\r\n\r\ntype  of learning environment where the teachers may not  always\r\n\r\nknow more than the students.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOur  students  today  have  access to  a  tremendous  amount  of\r\n\r\ninformation  through  the Internet and other  resources.   Their\r\n\r\nlearning is no longer confined to the classroom.  Teachers  must\r\n\r\nbe prepared to explore, experiment and learn together with their\r\n\r\nstudents.   This  is  a departure from the  old  paradigm  where\r\n\r\nteachers were dispensers of knowledge.  They must facilitate the\r\n\r\nstudents'  learning,  teach them how to  access  and  critically\r\n\r\nevaluate information and how to arrive at solutions to problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, teachers are also role models for their students.\r\n\r\nThey  need  to exemplify the values and attributes we desire  in\r\n\r\nour students.  These are not just about fundamental moral values\r\n\r\nas  such.   Our  teachers  must strive  to  be  role  models  in\r\n\r\nthinking, learning and innovating.  If we desire our students to\r\n\r\nbe  inquisitive and think for themselves, then the teachers must\r\n\r\nencourage  the  spirit of questioning and  experimentation.   To\r\n\r\nhelp  students develop their different abilities to the fullest,\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  must know almost instinctively how  to  recognise\r\n\r\nthose  abilities  in their students in the first  place  and  be\r\n\r\nknowledgeable  about  how to help their  students  with  special\r\n\r\ntalents  or  needs.   In other words, the teacher  must  have  a\r\n\r\ndifferent set of teaching skills and a different mindset towards\r\n\r\nteaching altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help teachers meet these challenges, my committee has\r\n\r\nreviewed  the current teacher training system and come out  with\r\n\r\nbroad  recommendations which can be categorised into three  main\r\n\r\nareas:  (1)  improving initial teacher training; (2) encouraging\r\n\r\nteachers   to   continually   upgrade   themselves;   and    (3)\r\n\r\nstrengthening the partnership between MOE, NIE and schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial teacher training covers two stages - the foundation\r\n\r\ntraining  which the new recruits receive or undergo at NIE,  and\r\n\r\nthe  induction and on-the-job training that they receive  up  to\r\n\r\nthe end of their first year in school after graduation from NIE.\r\n\r\nThe  majority  of  our  trainee teachers  spend  only  one  year\r\n\r\nundergoing foundation training in NIE.  In this one year, we not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nonly  have to provide them with pedagogical and content training\r\n\r\nbut  also  imbue  in  them the values and mindsets  required  of\r\n\r\nteachers in the new teaching environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the limited time available, it is not possible for\r\n\r\nNIE  to  achieve everything.  We have to prioritise  and  decide\r\n\r\nwhich  components of teacher training are most critical at  this\r\n\r\nfoundation stage.  If developing the character and motivation of\r\n\r\nour students is of utmost importance, then it must be so for our\r\n\r\nteachers  also.  Our primary emphasis at the foundation training\r\n\r\nstage  should  therefore  be on values education  for  teachers,\r\n\r\nfollowed by knowledge and some core skills and competencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is values education? By values education, we mean a\r\n\r\ncommitment   to  the  mission  of  the  Education  Service,   an\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and appreciation of the philosophy and  evolution\r\n\r\nof  our  education policies, knowledge of national and  regional\r\n\r\nissues   that  affect  Singapore,  commitment  to  the   maximal\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the student as well as commitment to  their  own,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the teacher's own continued professional and personal\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Towards this end, my committee has drawn up a  set\r\n\r\nof  Desired  Outcomes  of Initial Teacher  Training  which  will\r\n\r\nhenceforth guide the design of the teacher training curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other changes are also having an impact on some programmes\r\n\r\nof  the foundation training.  The profile of the intake into the\r\n\r\nEducation  Service  is changing.  The majority  of  our  trainee\r\n\r\nteachers,  about 1,000 to 1,100 out of the 2,000 per  year,  are\r\n\r\ngraduates  from NUS and NTU, who do a post-graduate  diploma  in\r\n\r\neducation.   These  form the backbone of our  graduate  teaching\r\n\r\nforce in the secondary and primary schools.  Together with those\r\n\r\n`A'  level recruits who take the BA/BSc cum Diploma in Education\r\n\r\nprogramme  at  NIE (and who number about 100 to 150  per  year),\r\n\r\ngraduate  teachers constitute roughly 60% to 62% of our  trained\r\n\r\nteacher  output  each year.  However, the Diploma  in  Education\r\n\r\n(Dip-Ed) course, which takes in both\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n`A'  level and polytechnic diploma holders, is recruiting  fewer\r\n\r\n`A'  level entrants over the years.  This is mainly because  `A'\r\n\r\nlevel  holders now have much more opportunities to pursue either\r\n\r\na university or polytechnic education as compared to before.  As\r\n\r\na  result, more of our new non-graduate teachers are polytechnic\r\n\r\ndiploma holders.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, we recruited 226 polytechnic diploma holders and\r\n\r\n293  `A' level holders for the Dip-Ed course at NIE.  Last year,\r\n\r\nthe  number  of polytechnic diploma holders recruited  was  436,\r\n\r\nalmost double the figure two years ago, while the number of  `A'\r\n\r\nlevel  holders has declined by 15%, to about 250.  We can expect\r\n\r\nthis  trend to continue.  These polytechnic diploma holders will\r\n\r\nbring  with  them different strengths and weaknesses from  their\r\n\r\n`A'   level  counterparts.   This  means  the  teacher  training\r\n\r\ncurriculum must be flexible enough to cater to the needs of  the\r\n\r\nteacher  trainees with different academic backgrounds.   At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, we will ensure that the training is rigorous and that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  compromise in standards expected of  our  trainee\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides reviewing the curriculum, my Committee has\r\n\r\nrecommended  that the NIE BA/BSc cum Dip-Ed degree programme  be\r\n\r\nre-positioned  to  attract  academically  stronger   polytechnic\r\n\r\ndiploma holders.  Currently, direct entry into this programme is\r\n\r\nrestricted   only  to  `A'  level  holders.   There   are   good\r\n\r\npolytechnic  diploma holders who may be interested in  teaching.\r\n\r\nWe  want  to  open up the degree programme to those  polytechnic\r\n\r\ndiploma  holders who have gone through the NIE Dip-Ed  programme\r\n\r\nand   have   taught  in  the  schools  for  a  certain   period,\r\n\r\nparticularly those who have demonstrated good performance in the\r\n\r\nEducation Service.  For some polytechnic diploma holders who are\r\n\r\nable  to  meet  NIE's pre-requisite requirements,  we  can  even\r\n\r\nconsider  them  for  direct entry into NIE's  degree  programme.\r\n\r\nWith more polytechnic diploma holders upgrading\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthrough  degree  programmes,  the  proportion  of  our  graduate\r\n\r\nteachers will rise further in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation training alone will not bring teachers fully up\r\n\r\nto  the  basic level of competency needed for them  to  function\r\n\r\neffectively  in  schools.  MOE and schools  themselves  have  an\r\n\r\nimportant role to play in providing induction and basic training\r\n\r\nduring  the  teacher's first year in school.  The  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nstarted  centralised  induction training for  all  newly-trained\r\n\r\nteachers.   In addition, guidelines are being drawn up  to  help\r\n\r\nschools  conduct  their own school-based induction  training  to\r\n\r\nattune  the new teachers to their particular school culture  and\r\n\r\nethos.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Committee has recommended that all new teachers be given\r\n\r\nfour-fifths  of  the normal responsibility load in  their  first\r\n\r\nyear.  This off-loading of new teachers is in recognition of the\r\n\r\nfact that new teachers in their first year have special needs of\r\n\r\nadjustment and training and will need time for this.  They  will\r\n\r\nonly  be given the normal load upon confirmation at the  end  of\r\n\r\ntheir  first  year in school.  The new teachers will  spend  the\r\n\r\nreleased  time on classroom observations of experienced teachers\r\n\r\nand undergo on-the-job training, including co-teaching with more\r\n\r\nexperienced  teachers.  The Ministry will  implement  this  with\r\n\r\neffect  from  1st  January  2000,  and  will  factor  this  into\r\n\r\nconsideration when allocating resources to schools.   The  final\r\n\r\ndecision on how new teachers are to be off-loaded will rest with\r\n\r\nthe  principals.  The principals are people on the  ground,  and\r\n\r\nthey  are  in  a better position to decide how best to  allocate\r\n\r\nresources to meet the needs of their teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above initiatives on Initial Teacher Training are aimed\r\n\r\nat  providing  teachers  with  a strong  foundation  of  skills,\r\n\r\nknowledge  and  values, and helping them to settle  in  the  new\r\n\r\nschools comfortably.  In this respect, our senior teachers, whom\r\n\r\nMr  Loh also spoke about, who have accumulated years of teaching\r\n\r\nexperience,  can  make  a valuable contribution  by  serving  as\r\n\r\nmentors, by hand-holding and guiding these new teachers who have\r\n\r\njust started their career in teaching in the schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come now to the second broad recommendation of my\r\n\r\nCommittee.  Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Iswaran as well as Mr  Loh,\r\n\r\nhave  spoken  on  the need for in-service or  continual  teacher\r\n\r\ntraining.  Indeed, the skills and knowledge our teachers acquire\r\n\r\nat  the initial teacher training stage will not be enough to see\r\n\r\nthem  through  their entire career.  Our teachers will  need  to\r\n\r\nconstantly  refresh their skills and knowledge to keep  up  with\r\n\r\nthe  latest developments in education.  They should see  initial\r\n\r\nteacher training and continual teacher training as a continuum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are opening up more opportunities for teachers to pursue\r\n\r\nfurther  studies.  With the liberalisation of  the  Study  Leave\r\n\r\nScheme  in  1998,  384 non-graduate teachers  were  granted  in-principle  approval  to  pursue full-time undergraduate  studies\r\n\r\nlast  year.  This represents a nearly five-fold increase in  the\r\n\r\nnumbers  granted approval, compared to the previous years.   But\r\n\r\nfor the majority of the classroom teachers, upgrading will be in\r\n\r\nthe  form  of  training  conducted either  by  the  school,  the\r\n\r\ncluster,  the  Teachers'  Network  or  NIE.   Our  teachers  are\r\n\r\nentitled  to 100 hours of training each year, which is  slightly\r\n\r\nmore  than  the two weeks of training provided by some companies\r\n\r\nas  quoted  by  Mr Iswaran.  We recognise that  there  are  many\r\n\r\ndemands  placed on the teacher's time today, so  we  are  always\r\n\r\nlooking  at  various ways to give teachers more time  for  their\r\n\r\nprofessional   development.   We   are   already   stepping   up\r\n\r\nrecruitment  as much as possible, so that we can  allocate  more\r\n\r\nteaching  and non-teaching resources to schools, and  this  will\r\n\r\ngive  principals more flexibility to meet the training needs  of\r\n\r\nthe teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Committee has come up with a number of proposals to make\r\n\r\ncontinual  training  more  \"teacher-friendly\".   First,  courses\r\n\r\nwill,  in  future, be structured in a more modular  form.   This\r\n\r\nwill  enable teachers to offer courses in smaller \"bites\".  They\r\n\r\ncan  progress at a pace that they are comfortable with.  Second,\r\n\r\ncontinual  training  will,  as far  as  possible,  be  delivered\r\n\r\nthrough distance learning or by having NIE lecturers go down to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nschools  and  cluster centres to facilitate  training  sessions.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to minimise inconvenience to the teachers.   Continual\r\n\r\ntraining  will  become very much a part of  a  teacher's  school\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, most continual training courses are offered as\r\n\r\nstandalone   courses,  which  do  not  lead  to  any   form   of\r\n\r\ncertification  or  significant  milestones.   My  Committee  has\r\n\r\nrecommended that an accreditation system be developed to  enable\r\n\r\nteachers to gain credits for relevant modules attended, so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  eventually chalk up enough credits  for  professional\r\n\r\ncertification  or higher qualifications.  This is  to  give  due\r\n\r\nrecognition  to  the  efforts put  in  by  teachers  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a period of time, we hope to see more of our non-graduate teachers upgrading to degree status, and more graduate\r\n\r\nteachers going on to obtain higher qualifications.  This  is  in\r\n\r\nline  with  our vision of a Learning Nation, and is  a  positive\r\n\r\ndevelopment for the entire Education Service.  Not only will  it\r\n\r\nenhance the professionalism of our teachers, it will also  boost\r\n\r\nthe standing and morale of the entire Education Service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, my Committee also studied how we can strengthen\r\n\r\nthe partnership between MOE, NIE and the schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as teachers are role models for their students, NIE\r\n\r\nlecturers   are   role  models  for  their   teacher   trainees.\r\n\r\nFoundation training in NIE must therefore be a model of the very\r\n\r\nsame  effective  practices  expected  of  teachers  in  Thinking\r\n\r\nSchools.   In  this  way, trainee teachers  will  have  personal\r\n\r\nexperience  of  the  desired  values  and  attitudes,   creative\r\n\r\nteaching methods, the use of educational technology and  so  on,\r\n\r\nand  these  trainee teachers will be fully equipped to  practise\r\n\r\nthe same when they are posted to schools.  At the same time,  as\r\n\r\nMr  Loh so rightly pointed out, there are many new teachers that\r\n\r\nwe  have recruited into the Education Service.  They bring  with\r\n\r\nthem  fresh ideas.  We must be open to these ideas, both  within\r\n\r\nNIE as well as the school system.  Through suggestion\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nschemes, the WITs culture, and greater sharing opportunities, we\r\n\r\nhope to create an atmosphere, a culture of receptiveness and  an\r\n\r\nattitude  of continuous improvement amongst our entire  teaching\r\n\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, to help NIE stay closely attuned to the actual\r\n\r\nclassroom  situation  in schools, my Committee  has  recommended\r\n\r\nthat  MOE  and  NIE should systematically plan  for  the  cross-posting  of  NIE lecturers and teachers as part of their  career\r\n\r\ndevelopment, to give them wider exposure to different aspects of\r\n\r\nthe  education system.  Experienced teachers will be  posted  to\r\n\r\nNIE as adjunct lecturers or full-time staff.  NIE lecturers will\r\n\r\nalso be posted for short stints in MOE HQ or the schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, it is important for newly-trained\r\n\r\nteachers  to  feel confident that the training  that  they  have\r\n\r\nreceived  in NIE is practical, realistic and prepares them  well\r\n\r\nfor  the situations they are likely to face in school.  NIE  has\r\n\r\ndone  a  good  job  thus far, but increasingly  as  our  schools\r\n\r\nevolve,  we will need a closer partnership between NIE, MOE  and\r\n\r\nschools  to ensure that teacher training keeps in step with  the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the  education system.  A joint Committee has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  formed between MOE and NIE, and various working committees\r\n\r\nhave  started  deliberating on the implementation  details  that\r\n\r\nwill  bring NIE's curriculum, teaching methods, as well  as  its\r\n\r\norganisational  systems and processes to be  in  line  with  our\r\n\r\nchanging emphasis in teacher training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's success in the 21st century depends on the\r\n\r\nability  of  the  education system to equip our young  with  the\r\n\r\nskills,  values  and mindsets to cope with an uncertain  future.\r\n\r\nOur  teachers, who have been entrusted with this responsibility,\r\n\r\nmust  exemplify  these  same attributes. A  strong,  nimble  and\r\n\r\nresponsive   teacher  training  system  will  be   critical   in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  these attributes in our teachers.   I  am  confident\r\n\r\nthat  the  changes to the teacher training system  that  I  have\r\n\r\noutlined, will bring us closer towards\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrealising  our vision of Thinking Schools, Learning  Nation.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  I  have also answered many of the points  raised  about\r\n\r\nteacher training by Members of this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, many\r\n\r\nteachers  are  asking  whether  the  Government  could  consider\r\n\r\nallowing   them  to  take  up  some  suitable  part-time   jobs.\r\n\r\nRecently,  a  teacher  from the Catholic  Junior  College,  Miss\r\n\r\nAnnetha Ayyavoo, took part in a Supermodel Pageant overseas  and\r\n\r\nwon  the First Prize.  When she came back to Singapore, she  was\r\n\r\ncalled up by the Ministry of Education for investigation.   This\r\n\r\nis regrettable!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are moving into the 21st century very soon. If we want\r\n\r\nto  transform Singapore into a creative society where \"a hundred\r\n\r\nflowers bloom\", we should be more flexible in dealing with  some\r\n\r\nobsolete rules in the Instruction Manuals of our civil servants.\r\n\r\nWe  should not go by the book.  There should be more flexibility\r\n\r\nfrom time to time.  In my view, as long as it does not harm  the\r\n\r\noperation  of  the civil service system and affect  his  or  her\r\n\r\nexisting  work, a civil servant should be given   more space  to\r\n\r\npursue their hobbies or interests, or to take up part-time jobs.\r\n\r\nOnly  then can we enable Singaporeans to create a more  creative\r\n\r\nsocial environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, if a teacher wants to take up some part-time jobs,\r\n\r\nsuch as tutors,  textbook writers, textbook vetters or to pursue\r\n\r\ntheir hobbies or jobs that they enjoy doing, they must, first of\r\n\r\nall,  get  the approval of the Ministry of Education.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nthe  remuneration  from their part-time job including  the  fees\r\n\r\npaid  to  him for the articles he contributed in the  newspapers\r\n\r\nwill  have to be surrendered to the Ministry of Education.  This\r\n\r\nis  contrary to the Government's effort to promote diligence and\r\n\r\ncreativity  in  our  people.  If every teacher  is  so  strictly\r\n\r\nobedient,  go  by the book for fear of violating any  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations,  then  they will not dare to venture.   They  would\r\n\r\njust  refrain  from making new experiments.  Then,  how  are  we\r\n\r\ngoing to cultivate in our students the spirit of creativity?   I\r\n\r\nthink this is not a good sign.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coincidentally, the Government issued a circular in\r\n\r\nNovember  last year to all civil servants that anyone who  takes\r\n\r\nup  a part-time job will have to surrender all his earnings from\r\n\r\nthe  part-time  job to his department.  I think  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  reconsider this matter.  Members of this House  are  not\r\n\r\nfull-time  MPs, they are part-timers, so to speak.   We  do  not\r\n\r\nhave   to   surrender  our  allowances  to  our   companies   or\r\n\r\norganisations  where  we are supposed to be  working  full-time.\r\n\r\nSome  of  our  MPs are teachers.  They do not have to  surrender\r\n\r\ntheir  allowances to the Ministry of Education.  Why then should\r\n\r\ncivil servants be required to do so?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, teachers in the Government schools are not allowed to\r\n\r\ntake  up part-time jobs.  However, teachers in the aided-schools\r\n\r\nare  allowed  to do so.  Teachers in the Government schools  are\r\n\r\nnaturally  not  very  happy about it.  I hope  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation can clarify this.  While we are moving towards a  more\r\n\r\ncreative  Singapore  in  the 21st century,  we  should  be  more\r\n\r\nflexible in dealing with the approval of part-time jobs for  our\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, we can all agree educating\r\n\r\nour  children  must  be  the  most important  responsibility  of\r\n\r\nparents.   Yet, for obvious practical reasons, we have dedicated\r\n\r\nthis  role, the most important job, to teachers.  Children spend\r\n\r\na  large part of their lives with their teachers to prepare them\r\n\r\nfor the world.  With so much information available elsewhere,  I\r\n\r\nwould  argue that it is possible to get more information outside\r\n\r\nschool,  or  even perhaps in an encyclopaedia.  But the  teacher\r\n\r\ndoes more, because what you learn in school, you learn in a  way\r\n\r\nwhich  you  cannot  learn  in any other place  or  circumstance.\r\n\r\nTeachers  have  a  special  task only  teachers  can  do.   They\r\n\r\ninspire,  lead,  guide,  stimulate, and sometimes  to  goad  and\r\n\r\nirritate.  In schools, students learn to explore, to inquire, to\r\n\r\nask question and to experiment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers used to occupy a special position in our society.\r\n\r\nMore often than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot,  they were also leaders of the community, and regarded with\r\n\r\nrespect  and  high  esteem. I, however, suspect  that  over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  the  special position that teachers  have  occupied  has\r\n\r\nsomewhat deteriorated.  Worse, I sense that parents are now more\r\n\r\ncasual  about openly criticising teachers, even in front of  the\r\n\r\nchildren.  I know of parents who are fully equipped with a  list\r\n\r\nof  complaints as they prepare to encounter teachers  in  school\r\n\r\nduring  parents and teachers meeting.  It is becoming common  to\r\n\r\nhear  of  parents  wanting to transfer their children  to  other\r\n\r\nschools, because they think teachers are not doing a good job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, tuition teachers, most of whom are teachers\r\n\r\nthemselves,  are better treated and better paid by parents.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to  do  more  to uplift and enhance the social  status  of\r\n\r\nteachers  through national awards and recognition.  Although  we\r\n\r\nhave  the  National  Day awards, they are  sometimes  not  quite\r\n\r\nvisible.   Generally, many are still shy of using  their  titles\r\n\r\nlike  PPM  and  BBM.   Perhaps we can think  of  other  ways  to\r\n\r\nrecognise good teachers and principals, eg, to appoint  them  to\r\n\r\nvarious Government and social institutions.  But, ultimately, it\r\n\r\nis  society,  parents and children themselves  who  should  show\r\n\r\ngreater  respect for teachers.  I would suggest  that  with  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of  every  academic year, it is made  compulsory  for\r\n\r\nparents to meet teachers through orientation programmes, so that\r\n\r\nthey  get to know more of the school and the teachers whom  they\r\n\r\nhave  entrusted to do this vital job.  It is very much like what\r\n\r\nis  done in the SAF for parents of new enlistees.  One day in  a\r\n\r\nyear  is certainly not too much for parents.  Hopefully, through\r\n\r\nsuch  interaction with parents and better understanding of their\r\n\r\nroles  and  the continuous effort and emphasis to recognise  the\r\n\r\ngood  work  of  teachers,  the social position  and  respect  of\r\n\r\nteachers can be put to where they really deserve.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, early childhood education has been\r\n\r\nleft  primarily  to the private sector with a significant  input\r\n\r\nfrom   the  PAP  Community  Foundation's  kindergarten  centres.\r\n\r\nAlmost all children\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nentering  primary  school  have  had  at  least  two  years   in\r\n\r\nkindergarten  where  there  is some degree  of  preparation  for\r\n\r\nprimary   education.   However,  this  preparation  for  primary\r\n\r\neducation  is  done  at different phase and different  intensity\r\n\r\nwith  different centres focusing on different things.  Do  these\r\n\r\nkindergartens  meet the Ministry of Education's expectations  of\r\n\r\nwhat  they  should  do  to  prepare  the  children  for  primary\r\n\r\neducation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start with, does the Ministry expect the kindergartens\r\n\r\nto  prepare  children for primary education?  If  so,  what  are\r\n\r\nexpected  of  the children who enter primary one?    Considering\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of pre-primary education as  a  foundation  for\r\n\r\nprimary  education, it is very important therefore, to  me,  for\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  to  issue  clear  guidelines  in  the  areas   of\r\n\r\ncurriculum  to  all  providers and operators  of  nurseries  and\r\n\r\nkindergartens.   If our pre-primary educators and  parents  know\r\n\r\nexactly  what the children are expected to know when the  latter\r\n\r\nenter  primary  one,  our  children's learning  journey  can  be\r\n\r\nsmoother.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, as time is running out, allow me to\r\n\r\nvery briefly respond to the three Members who just spoke.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua said that the Ministry should not stifle\r\n\r\nthe  creativity  of teachers by requiring its teachers  to  seek\r\n\r\nprior  approval before they engage in part-time  work.   I  must\r\n\r\nstress  that  teaching  is  a very demanding  profession.   When\r\n\r\npeople choose to serve as teachers with MOE, we would like  them\r\n\r\nto  give full attention, energies and commitment to the job.  My\r\n\r\nMinistry  currently allows part-time work on a selective  basis,\r\n\r\nand  only on the condition that the teacher's performance is not\r\n\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh said that there is a civil service rule requiring\r\n\r\nall civil servants to return the money that they earn from their\r\n\r\npart-time work to their departments.  There is no such so-called\r\n\r\nrule.   The Public Service Division's circular that he  referred\r\n\r\nto  says  that  where  a civil servant uses  official  material,\r\n\r\nknowledge, time or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresources to help him engage in outside work - say, as an author\r\n\r\nwriting a book - he would then have to pay the royalties and the\r\n\r\nfees  earned  to  his Government department.   But  if  a  civil\r\n\r\nservant   is  involved  in  publications  done  in  his  private\r\n\r\ncapacity,  eg,  work related to his personal hobby  or  interest\r\n\r\nthat   involves  no  official  material,  knowledge,   time   or\r\n\r\nresources,  he  is  allowed to retain the fees  or  remuneration\r\n\r\narising from such work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin spoke about the need for parents\r\n\r\nand  the  wider  community  to  accord  more  respect  and  more\r\n\r\nappreciation  to  teachers.  I cannot agree with  him  more.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  parents  and  the  wider  community  need  to   have\r\n\r\nappropriate appreciation for the heavy responsibilities  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, over the last few years especially, done quite a\r\n\r\nlot  to  raise the image and the morale of teachers.  He  talked\r\n\r\nabout  giving  awards and so on.  Indeed, we do  have  teachers'\r\n\r\nawards.   We  have  the Caring Teachers award every  year.   For\r\n\r\nChinese  teachers, we have the Inspiring Chinese Teacher  award.\r\n\r\nAnd  do not forget, we have initiated last year, the President's\r\n\r\nAward for Teachers, which is the highest kind of recognition  we\r\n\r\ncan   give  to  a  teacher  for  his  or  her  contribution  and\r\n\r\nperformance.   Literally,  there were thousands  of  nominations\r\n\r\nsubmitted  for this President's Award, and this is a  reflection\r\n\r\nof  our  teachers' efforts, as well as the fact that  a  lot  of\r\n\r\npeople  out  there,  in spite of Mr Zulkifli's  perception  that\r\n\r\nthere seems to be a declining respect for teachers, who want  to\r\n\r\ngive  due recognition to teachers who have made a difference  to\r\n\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the parent/community relations are concerned, I\r\n\r\nthink  later  on in the debate, we would have an opportunity  to\r\n\r\ntalk   about  the  Ministry's  latest  initiative,  ie,  COMPASS\r\n\r\n(Community and Parents in Support of Schools).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me respond to Mr Hawazi briefly on early childhood\r\n\r\neducation.   My Ministry regulates the private kindergartens  by\r\n\r\nregistering  them, setting curriculum guidelines and accrediting\r\n\r\nteacher training.  The kindergartens plan their curriculum based\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  our  guidelines,  which  are focused  on  the  developmental\r\n\r\nmilestones  of  children at the ages 3 to 5.  MOE believes  that\r\n\r\nkindergartens should prepare children for learning, and we  will\r\n\r\nbe  revising  the  guidelines for early childhood  education  to\r\n\r\nensure  that early childhood - the period that the child  spends\r\n\r\nin  kindergarten  -  should be a time when the child learns  and\r\n\r\ndevelops through various activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children in the pre-school years will develop language\r\n\r\nuse,  understanding  of  numbers, learn  some  good  social  and\r\n\r\npersonal  habits,  and learn to appreciate  music  and  to  gain\r\n\r\nconfidence through basic skills, simple sports and  so  on.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  looking into spelling out the desired entry  level\r\n\r\ncompetencies for formal schooling, with special attention  being\r\n\r\npaid  to  language  development and social and affective  goals.\r\n\r\nThese  entry level competencies will be realistic and  will  not\r\n\r\nrequire  pupils  to be able to do at the pre-school  stage  what\r\n\r\nthey will be taught at primary one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this, we will be looking into guiding the\r\n\r\nkindergartens   further  in  matters  of   curriculum,   teacher\r\n\r\ntraining, quality and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, thank you for your indulgence. I\r\n\r\nthought it will be useful to address the point that Mr Low  Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang  brought up earlier.  He basically asked  that  with  the\r\n\r\nuniversity  admission  system, what do  we  expect  parents  and\r\n\r\nstudents to change?  What values do we expect?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will begin with a little story. I went to Japan in\r\n\r\nAugust  1997,  to  pay  a visit and to understand  the  Japanese\r\n\r\neducation  system.  They brought me to a high  school,  a  very,\r\n\r\nvery modern high school, one of the newest high schools in Japan\r\n\r\n-   aluminum  finishing,  glass walls  and  so  on.   They  have\r\n\r\nwonderful  computer  facilities,  enough  to  make  any  of  our\r\n\r\nschools,   which  are  already  very  well  equipped  by   world\r\n\r\nstandards,  enough  to  make  their  mouths  water.   They  have\r\n\r\nwonderful student to computer ratio.  They brought me around the\r\n\r\nschool.  They\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshowed  me the laboratories, wonderful facilities.  I  spoke  to\r\n\r\nthe  physics  teacher and he explained to me  how  he  is  using\r\n\r\nexperiential  learning  and  so  forth  to  teach  his  students\r\n\r\nscience,  physics  and  all that.   They  would  go  out  to  do\r\n\r\nexperiments  in the garden and things like that.   So  I  was  a\r\n\r\nlittle  puzzled.  I asked him, \"How do you reconcile  this  with\r\n\r\npreparing  your  students  for  the  Tokyo  University  entrance\r\n\r\nexaminations  system?\"  And his reply surprised  me.   He  said,\r\n\r\n\"Ah,  for  the  students who are preparing  for  the  university\r\n\r\nentrance   examinations  system,  we  have  a  more  traditional\r\n\r\nsyllabus.   This  is  for the students  who  are  not  going  to\r\n\r\nuniversity.\"   That  really took me aback.  I  discovered  later\r\n\r\nthat  some  three-quarters of the students in  the  school  were\r\n\r\ngirls.   It is a very new school, innovative curriculum, and  he\r\n\r\nexplained  to  me that for the girls, it is OK.  For  the  boys,\r\n\r\nthey  have to prepare them seriously for the university entrance\r\n\r\nexamination.   So it is too much of a risk to send them  through\r\n\r\nthis kind of system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the moral of the story, Sir? The moral of the\r\n\r\nstory  is  that if we stick to our present university  admission\r\n\r\nsystem,  which is based solely on the 'A' levels, one  throw  of\r\n\r\nthe  dice  on  the 'A' levels, nothing else that we  do  in  the\r\n\r\neducation  system makes a difference.  Parents and the  students\r\n\r\nwill  continue to focus their efforts on getting that extra mark\r\n\r\nin  the 'A' levels.  ECA and all the other things do not matter.\r\n\r\nWhat do we hope to see with the new university admission system,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  stress  again, goes beyond adding  in  the  SAT1?   It\r\n\r\nincludes  adding in ECA and project work.  What do  we  hope  to\r\n\r\nsee?  We hope to have a more balanced system, a system which  is\r\n\r\nmore  aligned with achieving the Desired Outcomes of  Education,\r\n\r\nand  a  system  which  recognises  effort,  discipline,  content\r\n\r\nknowledge via the `A' levels; which recognises reasoning ability\r\n\r\nand  a  more  general  ability  of  the  student  to  cope  with\r\n\r\nuniversity  education, via SAT1 even though he may not  have  As\r\n\r\nfor  his  `A'  levels.   ECA,  where  we  have  EQ,  leadership,\r\n\r\ntenacity,   the   ability   to  face   difficult   and   unusual\r\n\r\ncircumstances;  project  work,  where  again  things  like   EQ,\r\n\r\napplication of knowledge, team work and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nso  on.   So,  what  we  are looking for is  a  broad  range  of\r\n\r\nattributes  which we want our students to have.  If  we  do  not\r\n\r\nchange our university admission system, nothing else that we are\r\n\r\ntrying to do in the education system is going to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
