Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nChan  Kian  Hin and Abdul Razak bin Ahmad were both served  with\r\n\r\nExpulsion Orders on 18th November 1966 for their involvement  in\r\n\r\nCommunist front activities. The Government decided to revoke the\r\n\r\norder of expulsion against Chan on 10th December 1966 in view of\r\n\r\nChan's clear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrepentance  for  his past actions, and the appeals  from  Chan's\r\n\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> As I\r\n\r\nunderstood  from the Minister when I last raised  the  question,\r\n\r\ntheir crime was agitation for greater academic freedom and I was\r\n\r\ntold  that  they  were also creating fights.   If  that  is  the\r\n\r\nreason, why was it found possible to revoke the Order against Mr\r\n\r\nChan  just  because he made an appeal and showed his  repentance\r\n\r\nwhen the others have not had the Orders revoked?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, in our exchange in the last\r\n\r\ndebate,  I  made it very clear that it was not just  a  case  of\r\n\r\nstudents  agitating  just  for academic  freedom.   They  played\r\n\r\nleading roles in the organisation of demonstrations, processions\r\n\r\nand  even  a  violent clash.  This is part  of  the  same  story\r\n\r\nbecause, as I have mentioned just now, the communists were using\r\n\r\nthe students.  There was a plan to exploit the student unrest by\r\n\r\nuniting  the  various  protest movements,  intensifying  illegal\r\n\r\nstreet  processions and demonstrations and provoking a situation\r\n\r\nthat  would undermine law and order.  These led to the formation\r\n\r\nof  the  students' national action front - which the  Government\r\n\r\nsaw, at that time, to be a dangerous development because it  was\r\n\r\ndominated  by  left  wing and pro-communist  elements  from  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University and the Chinese Middle Schools.  Hence,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had to nip the situation in the bud, act  decisively\r\n\r\nand four foreign students were expelled.  Again, as I have said,\r\n\r\nevery  case must be decided on its own merits and facts.   Here,\r\n\r\nChan Kian Hin had made an individual appeal, where he had stated\r\n\r\nvery clearly his repentance for his past actions and his father,\r\n\r\nwho was a Singaporean, also appealed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Jeyaretnam is still championing the cause of Chan\r\n\r\nKian  Hin, who is now dead, and in his question, he also  talked\r\n\r\nabout  Abdul Razak, I think we should know what interest he  has\r\n\r\ngot  in  the  matter.   As  I said the  last  time,  why  is  he\r\n\r\nchampioning the cause of a foreigner who has shown himself to be\r\n\r\nanti-Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I, again, remind the Minister that I am\r\n\r\nnot  here to answer questions.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, on Mr Jeyaretnam's earlier\r\n\r\npoint, parliamentary time is precious.  As Mr Jeyaretnam  is  an\r\n\r\nNCMP, he is accountable to this House and indeed to Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfor  the  questions  that he asks.  He has  asked  very  pointed\r\n\r\nquestions about foreigners who had been expelled.  It  is  right\r\n\r\nfor me to ask that question.  The record is very clear, Sir.  If\r\n\r\nyou  go  back to the record, you will see that those were  heady\r\n\r\ndays   when   there   were  student  protests,   demonstrations,\r\n\r\nprocessions   involving   students  from   the   four   tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions  at  that time.  There was indeed a  violent  clash\r\n\r\nwith the police at the City Hall.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with\r\n\r\nyour  leave, may I ask the Minister of State whether  any  other\r\n\r\nstudent leader has been arrested for the last 10 years?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Is he beholden to anybody?\r\n\r\nHe  has asked about the other foreigners who were also expelled.\r\n\r\nYes,  there  were four of them, all foreigners,  including  Chan\r\n\r\nKian  Hin.   But unlike Chan Kian Hin, the other three  did  not\r\n\r\nhave families who were Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister keeps asking\r\n\r\nme  and you say that I should not answer.

This was done to  allow\r\n\r\nMOM   to  take  on  a  more  integrated  approach  in  planning,\r\n\r\ndeveloping and managing human resources and to ensure that these\r\n\r\nfunctions are well coordinated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years ahead, competition will intensify as the\r\n\r\nglobal economy becomes increasingly interlinked.  In a knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy, the most important resource will not be merely  capital\r\n\r\nor machinery but human beings.  The strategy for us to thrive in\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge era must be to convert our manpower  into  a  key\r\n\r\nengine of growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the first point I wish to raise is on this aspect of\r\n\r\nmanpower  planning.  Could the Minister enlighten this House  on\r\n\r\n(1)  the overall manpower plans that MOM has in mind; (2)  MOM's\r\n\r\nstrategy  for balancing supply and demand of manpower;  (3)  how\r\n\r\nMOM  determines  manpower  demand; and  (4)  what  policies  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes  will  be  formulated to  synchronise  the  needs  of\r\n\r\nindustries for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nskilled manpower and the needs of Singaporeans for good jobs  in\r\n\r\nthe growth sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister also tell the House how the above\r\n\r\ninformation  will be released to the public to  raise  awareness\r\n\r\nabout  job  growing areas and the skills needed?  We would  also\r\n\r\nlike to know the progress of the Manpower 21 study effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, for the first time in many years, we suffered a\r\n\r\nnet job loss of 17,000.  In the good years, the net job gain was\r\n\r\n120,000.  What would be the projections for this year?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few days, we heard a lot from our colleagues\r\n\r\nabout  the  mismatch  between employers  and  employees  in  job\r\n\r\nexpectation  and  skills.  What effort is  being  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nEmployment Service Department to improve this situation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the low rate of population growth and the rapid\r\n\r\naging  process  of our society, we have had to rely  on  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.   We also lack skills or knowledge in certain  critical\r\n\r\nareas needed by industries and therefore the infusion of foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  is necessary.  Otherwise, we will not be able to attract\r\n\r\nthese high-tech industries.  This means that fewer jobs will  be\r\n\r\ncreated for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in a time of job loss and fewer job openings\r\n\r\navailable,  could  the Minister elaborate on what  measures  are\r\n\r\nbeing  taken to balance and manage the supply side of local  and\r\n\r\nforeign workforce?  During the recession, there are problems  of\r\n\r\nmissing   foreign   workers  and  increasing  disputes   between\r\n\r\nemployers  and foreign workers.  What measures is MOM taking  to\r\n\r\ntackle this problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I note that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has set up a special unit called the Manpower Planning\r\n\r\nDivision  and  the  Minister knows my  view  on  this  so-called\r\n\r\nmanpower approach which I have expressed in the House.  I  think\r\n\r\ndeveloping human resource is a far more important area of  focus\r\n\r\nfor his Ministry than just manpower planning.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant experience of most of the manpower planning\r\n\r\nagencies in the US  and UK historically is that they are usually\r\n\r\nwrong  in their projections.  Even in our case, for decades,  we\r\n\r\nhave  seen  how  regular  the  universities  have  been  out  in\r\n\r\nprojecting within a four-year period the output of graduates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day, I was talking to a young officer from the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development Council and she told me that  she  was  a\r\n\r\ngraduate from the Estate Management Faculty.  She told  me  that\r\n\r\nonly  one  third of her cohort from that Faculty probably  found\r\n\r\njobs   in   the  estate  management,  real  estate  or  property\r\n\r\ndevelopment sector where they have been trained.  The rest  have\r\n\r\nto  look  for jobs elsewhere in other sectors.  There  are  many\r\n\r\nother examples of civil engineers, accountants, lawyers, doctors\r\n\r\nwhich output from the university does not quite match the demand\r\n\r\noften times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble with manpower planning is that at the high\r\n\r\nlevel,  planning for manpower based on the growth of the economy\r\n\r\nis  tautological.  You need so many people in this area  because\r\n\r\nwe expect the economy to grow by so much in this sector.  At the\r\n\r\ndetailed  level, where you try to project jobs at the industrial\r\n\r\nsector  level,  you can often be way out because  of  definition\r\n\r\nboundaries.  This will be particularly so when the new knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy  will keep everyone guessing as to which are the sunrise\r\n\r\nand  sunset  sectors.   In this game, the  bureaucrats  are  not\r\n\r\nparticularly  the best participants.  Even in the  much  vaunted\r\n\r\nstock  and flow concept of skill/job retention and attrition,  I\r\n\r\nurge  caution.   For  example, I see in the  information  slides\r\n\r\npresented to Members of Parliament and resource persons,  yearly\r\n\r\ninflow  of 300,000 foreign labour and outflow of 260,000  for  a\r\n\r\nfresh  local cohort of 40,000.  This seems to me to  be  a  very\r\n\r\nlarge inflow and outflow figure in a year with a local cohort of\r\n\r\n40,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years, we have been known to be the training ground for a\r\n\r\nlot of foreign workers - from maids, shipyard workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  engineering sector to executives, coming here  to  work  and\r\n\r\nthen  going  to other countries.  We should bear  in  mind  that\r\n\r\nexperience and training opportunities go with the job.   When  a\r\n\r\njob  is  denied  to a Singaporean, the training  and  experience\r\n\r\nopportunities to them are also no more available.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger is that when the Government machinery gets set\r\n\r\nin, the plan will be to get in the foreign supply to satisfy the\r\n\r\nequation  forecast, while our own people who could  be  trained,\r\n\r\ncross-trained or upgraded are in the forgotten loop  or  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  loop.  Finding new ways and means to train and develop  our\r\n\r\npeople  is  a  more valuable effort than just bringing  in  from\r\n\r\noutside the members to satisfy the equation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to add that I am not against foreign talent. My\r\n\r\nconcern and experience in the private sector is that many of the\r\n\r\nso-called  foreign talents here are quite foreign but not  quite\r\n\r\ntalent.   Bringing  in  the  numbers will  deny  many  deserving\r\n\r\nSingaporeans the opportunity of training that goes with the job,\r\n\r\nand the numbers may well be wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the exchange between\r\n\r\nDr  Tan  Cheng  Bock, Member for Ayer Rajah and BG  George  Yeo,\r\n\r\nSecond  Minister for Trade and Industry shows that the topic  of\r\n\r\nforeign  talent can indeed be laden with emotion.  And  earlier,\r\n\r\nmy  colleague, Mr Chay Wai Chuen, has also pointed out the  same\r\n\r\nissue.   But  the  fact  is, by and large, Singaporeans  welcome\r\n\r\nimmigrants  to our land, especially those who can contribute  to\r\n\r\nSingapore and are prepared to sink their roots here.  After all,\r\n\r\nmost Singaporeans are descendants of immigrants ourselves.  But,\r\n\r\nas  Mr  Chay  pointed  out, this is a question  that  should  be\r\n\r\nbrought  out to the open, and that is, does induction of foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  introduce competition to our sons and daughters?   To  a\r\n\r\ncertain   extent,  I  believe  it  does.   A  fair   number   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  find  that  they  do  have  to  compete  with  new\r\n\r\nimmigrants for jobs and housing.  In certain cases, they see\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nforeign  talents  as taking away plum jobs  as  in  banking  and\r\n\r\nfinancial services, but of course, those are in small number and\r\n\r\nthose people affected can take care of themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other cases, they see foreign professionals holding\r\n\r\ndown  wages  in  growth areas like information technology.   So,\r\n\r\nobviously those affected would prefer them to be the king of the\r\n\r\nhill even though it is a small molehill.  So, the affected would\r\n\r\nusually  ask  what is meant by the term \"foreign talent\".   They\r\n\r\nwould  prefer the dictionary definition of the word \"talent\"  as\r\n\r\nreferring  to  people that Singapore, by itself, cannot  produce\r\n\r\nand not just cannot produce in sufficient number, but cannot  be\r\n\r\nproduced  at all.  Whereas, I think the Government's  definition\r\n\r\nis  more  like  anyone who can contribute to  Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\ndesignated areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state upfront that I support our existing foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  policies.  In many areas where there is  a  shortage  of\r\n\r\npeople,  foreign talents help in our economy. For  instance,  in\r\n\r\nthe area of information technology, the industry is already very\r\n\r\nvibrant  and the turnover too is high as it is.  And in  today's\r\n\r\nnewspaper, we read about the story of IT professionals earning a\r\n\r\nvery high income, and a lady professional who made dough in hard\r\n\r\ntimes  would  be able to buy diamonds as and when  she  prefers.\r\n\r\nSo,  even  today, there are many cases of professionals changing\r\n\r\njobs  for a 20% jump in salary and after holding the job at  the\r\n\r\ncurrent salary for less than three months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if we just depend on local manpower, I believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  salary will escalate even faster and we  would  price\r\n\r\nourselves  out of the global market.  And this is not a  problem\r\n\r\nunique  to  Singapore.   Even  in  the  United  States,  with  a\r\n\r\npopulation  of  220 million, it is also unable  to  meet  market\r\n\r\ndemands  by  just  depending on domestic  supply  alone.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult, the United States is opening its market, and absorbing a\r\n\r\nhigh  number of foreign IT professionals through increasing  the\r\n\r\nquota  of H1 visa in 1999. H1 is a US immigrant visa for skilled\r\n\r\nprofessionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  think  we  could say that, in the short-term, some individual\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   would  face  greater  competition  from   foreign\r\n\r\nimmigrants.  In the long-term, foreign immigrants bring  greater\r\n\r\nprosperity and diversity to our country.  On balance, we  should\r\n\r\nwelcome foreign immigrants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to some of the policies implemented by the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower that would affect the induction of  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents.  I am referring to the issuance of employment  pass  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Manpower when it took over that function  from\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Home Affairs.  In so doing, it introduces  the\r\n\r\nnew  classification of employment pass and I am referring to the\r\n\r\nP,  Q1  and  Q2.  Perhaps, the Ministry believes  that  the  new\r\n\r\nclassification  solves  some problems in  the  old  system  but,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, it also introduces some undesirable effects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, many highly educated foreigners are grouped\r\n\r\ntogether,  with  skilled  and semi-skilled  workers  in  the  Q2\r\n\r\ncategory, primarily because their current income is not as  high\r\n\r\nas  they  would like to have, especially in the current economic\r\n\r\ndownturn. By bringing these new immigrants to our country,  they\r\n\r\nhave  to adapt to our culture and, as such, it is not surprising\r\n\r\nthat their income level tends to be lower than Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nPRs  with  comparable backgrounds.  Some of these  professionals\r\n\r\ntake  it  as  an  affront  to them to be  lumped  together  with\r\n\r\nimmigrants of lower educational levels.  Furthermore, Q2 holders\r\n\r\ncannot bring their families to Singapore and that would make  it\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  for these foreigners to accept  job  offers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   As  a  result, some of them would  ask  for  higher\r\n\r\nsalary,  just to be classified as Q1.  To avoid this problem,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that we go back to the principle that we determine  the\r\n\r\ndesirability of these foreign talents based on their educational\r\n\r\nbackground  and  their ability to contribute to Singapore  on  a\r\n\r\nlong-term, and place less emphasis on their current income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item that I would like to bring up is that all\r\n\r\nimmigrants to Singapore would like to receive their PR status as\r\n\r\nsoon  as  possible.   There are many  advantages.   Being  a  PR\r\n\r\nchanges\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe whole orientation for them.  For example, they would be able\r\n\r\nto  buy  HDB flats in the resale market. PR status gives them  a\r\n\r\npeace of mind to settle down in Singapore.  On the other hand, I\r\n\r\ndetect  a  recent,  but  a  discernible  trend  of  PRs  leaving\r\n\r\nSingapore for greener pastures overseas.  I believe one  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  they left Singapore is that they discovered that  their\r\n\r\nincome  has  shrunk, as a result of our CPF cut, wage  restraint\r\n\r\npolicy  and the weakening Singapore dollar.  In comparing  their\r\n\r\nincome  on  a global scale, these professionals found that  they\r\n\r\nare  losing  out  to  their friends who have settled  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhile their behaviour is entirely understandable, but from those\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who have interacted with them, what I  would  call\r\n\r\n\"fair-weather PRs\", they lamented that Singapore is  being  used\r\n\r\nas  a  stepping stone.  They believe that perhaps we should only\r\n\r\nissue  PRs  to  those who are really committed to Singapore.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that it is a very fine balance between  meeting  the\r\n\r\naspirations of new immigrants through issuing them PRs and  also\r\n\r\nthe  need to inculcate a sense of belonging to Singapore.  There\r\n\r\nis  no  easy answer.  May I seek the Minister's comment  on  the\r\n\r\nissues I have brought up?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, in times of high\r\n\r\neconomic growth and full employment, I think it is fair for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment not to impose a limit on foreign talent.  In fact, in\r\n\r\n1989,  the  Government formed the Immigration Affairs  Committee\r\n\r\n(IMAC)  with  the  view  to bring in professionals  and  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  from Hong Kong.  The first batch of 25,000  Hongkongers\r\n\r\nwere  invited to work in Singapore.  Can the Government  let  us\r\n\r\nknow  how  many Hongkongers accepted the offer and  applied  for\r\n\r\nSingapore PR under that exercise?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1991, BG George Yeo, the Chairman of IMAC, in an\r\n\r\ninterview, informed the Berita Harian that there was no  cap  on\r\n\r\nforeign  talent,  including Malay/Muslims who wish  to  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as long as they can contribute to the  country.   He\r\n\r\nsaid that a ceiling is only appropriate if the number turns  out\r\n\r\nto be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntoo  large.  I would add that a ceiling should be introduced  in\r\n\r\ntimes  of high unemployment like the present time.  In the past,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  used  the Singapore Malay Chamber  of  Commerce,\r\n\r\nMendaki  and  the  two task forces formed  by  IMAC  to  attract\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslims and Indian talents from abroad.  In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nIndia,  advertisements for several jobs in Singapore  were  made\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to time, and sometimes, like Singapore Airlines,  it\r\n\r\nissued their own advertisements inviting job applications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether IMAC or other\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies are still actively recruiting foreign talent\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.   I wish to quote BG George Yeo.   He  said,  \"We\r\n\r\ncannot invite someone here and find him a job.  This is not  the\r\n\r\nway  we work.  In any case, it is not sustainable.\"  My feedback\r\n\r\nis  that  foreign  professionals who  come  here  to  find  work\r\n\r\nsometimes  are  selected in preference to local applicants.   It\r\n\r\nhappens  like  this.  Many foreign Caucasians  are  employed  as\r\n\r\nmanagers  in  our  local  firms  or  positions  where  they  are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for recruitment of new staff.  They  interview  the\r\n\r\napplicants.   If  in a group of applicants that are  interviewed\r\n\r\nhappens  to  have Caucasians or ang mohs among them, often  than\r\n\r\nnot  the  Caucasian  applications get selected.   The  Caucasian\r\n\r\nmanagers  that  do the selection often feel that they  have  the\r\n\r\nsame  background and culture as another Caucasian, and  probably\r\n\r\nhe can work better with another Caucasian than with a local.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  local  applications for jobs  can  be  discriminated\r\n\r\nagainst.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have known of one case where a Singaporean with an\r\n\r\nAustralian  mathematics degree was not selected for  a  teaching\r\n\r\npost  in  a  private  institution.   He  informed  me  that  the\r\n\r\ninterviewer  was an Australian.  The Australian selected  a  New\r\n\r\nZealand  applicant  in preference to him.  This  Singaporean  is\r\n\r\nvery  sore  and wants this case to be brought up in  Parliament.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, this may be the type of case that Dr Tan Cheng Bock had\r\n\r\nin mind when he warned against foreigners taking over jobs which\r\n\r\nrightly belong to Singaporeans.  I support Dr Tan in his call to\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to think of Singaporeans first  in  these  hard\r\n\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHe does not want Singaporeans to lose out to foreigners in their\r\n\r\napplications for jobs.  I do not think that Dr Tan  intended  to\r\n\r\ndo  Singapore  a  disservice when  he  made  that  call  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment the other day in Parliament.  I think Dr Tan realises\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore also needs plenty of foreign investments and  he\r\n\r\ndid not mean to give any wrong signals to foreigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, when Dr Tan Cheng Bock spoke last\r\n\r\nweek  during the debate on the Prime Minister's Office,  he  was\r\n\r\nmisunderstood,  so  much so that the New Paper  columnist  Raoul\r\n\r\nPatek made a very reasoned argument that we should not close our\r\n\r\ndoor  to  foreign talent.  Singapore has always welcomed foreign\r\n\r\ntalents and, in fact, it was a Dutch economist who brought us to\r\n\r\nwhere  we are today.  There are many areas which Singapore  does\r\n\r\nnot  have the expertise and I do not think that we will have  it\r\n\r\nin the near future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand Mr Chiam See Tong's plea for looking after\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But we can look after Singapore better if we look at\r\n\r\nthe  broader  economic  perspective because  these  are  people,\r\n\r\nwhether  in  the  IT  sector  or financial  sector,  who  create\r\n\r\neconomic  prosperity, jobs and wealth for us.  And  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  not be shortsighted that in times of crisis,  we  should\r\n\r\nforget  them.   To  do so would be suicidal.   Let  me  give  an\r\n\r\nexample.   When  I was in law school, most of my  teachers  were\r\n\r\nforeigners.  Things have changed.  Now, the Law Faculty has more\r\n\r\nlocal  lecturers  than foreigners.  Similarly, some  years  back\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Government wanted to bring foreign legal firms  here,\r\n\r\nsome  lawyers felt that the Government was not being fair.   But\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  look at it objectively.  If we do not allow  these\r\n\r\nforeign  legal firms to be based here, the work will go to  Hong\r\n\r\nKong and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister not to be shortsighted, but\r\n\r\nlook   at   the  broader  perspective  of  Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\nframework.   After  all,  we  are a  creature  of  an  immigrant\r\n\r\nsociety.   Many  of our forefathers came from China,  India  and\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplaces,  and  the  process must continue. And  if  we  want  the\r\n\r\nprocess to continue, then we must send the right message to  the\r\n\r\npeople, because foreign capital and foreign talent are in  short\r\n\r\nsupply.   Even America, with its huge population, is in need  of\r\n\r\ntalent.  That is why they go to Silicon Valley from India, China\r\n\r\nand  Taiwan.  And if we want to create a Silicon Valley, we must\r\n\r\nhave  these foreign talents here.  Sir, what is required is  for\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Manpower to lay down a broad policy and send the\r\n\r\nmessage to the world at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I do not forget my Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nbecause Singapore citizens and permanent residents who have been\r\n\r\nhere  have  a  stake  in this country.  But we  should  give  an\r\n\r\nassurance  in  this  House that their interests  will  never  be\r\n\r\nsacrificed.   We  are  bringing in these  people  to  serve  the\r\n\r\ncountry  better.  I hope when Raoul Patek reads today's  debate,\r\n\r\nhe will change his mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in the\r\n\r\nworld  today  where competition is very keen, the  progress  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  nations are determined more  and  more  by  the\r\n\r\nquality of its people.  Therefore, the Government has taken  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  approach  in emphasising on continuous  and  life  long\r\n\r\ntraining  and  retraining for our people.  We  have  managed  to\r\n\r\ndeservingly  earn  a reputation for having a  first-rate  and  a\r\n\r\nworld-class workforce.  The challenge therefore is  how  we  can\r\n\r\nmaintain and even improve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the military strategy of Sun Tze, he said the strength\r\n\r\nof  an  army does not depend on large forces.  Rather, one  must\r\n\r\nconcentrate the forces.  And this was taken from Sun  Tze's  Art\r\n\r\nof  War.    In my view, besides helping Singaporeans to  upgrade\r\n\r\nand  compete more effectively in the marketplace, we must reduce\r\n\r\nour  dependence  on foreign workers.  While I am not  belittling\r\n\r\nthe  contributions  of foreign workers, their  presence  is  not\r\n\r\nwithout  any cost.  I strongly urge the Ministry of Manpower  to\r\n\r\ntighten  its criteria and selection on the admission of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers, so that not any Tom, Dick and Harry can gain employment\r\n\r\nin Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nat  the  expense  of  Singaporeans.    If there  are  jobs  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  do  not  want or cannot  do,  then  by  all  means\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  can be considered for employment.   Today,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  have more than 400,000 foreign  workers  and  at\r\n\r\nleast half of them are employed in the construction sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to know if the Ministry has any\r\n\r\nplans in the pipeline to encourage the development of automation\r\n\r\nand  buildable designs in the construction industry.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthis will help to reduce our dependence on foreign workers,  and\r\n\r\nalso  we  can  improve  our  productivity  in  the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Ministry introduced a new work permit\r\n\r\nallocation system for the construction sector.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nknow  how effective this has been and whether there are any more\r\n\r\ncontrol measures being planned to promote self-regulation in the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the years, there were reports in the newspapers\r\n\r\nabout  social  problems we face with the vast  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  foreign workers.  MOM should help our  employers  to\r\n\r\nbuild  proper  outside dormitories and develop  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nmanagement  system to address the issue of housing  for  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.   This  is something which is of great concern  to  our\r\n\r\npeople,  because if too many foreign workers live in our housing\r\n\r\nestates,  it  would  create  some  social  problems.   With  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn,  many contractors  have  been  hit  by  poor\r\n\r\nbusiness,  and hence face cash flow problems.  Is  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconsidering  granting  some  flexibility  with  regard  to  late\r\n\r\npayment of levy and levy bond for genuine cases?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, with the measures taken by the Government so far in\r\n\r\nboosting  business competitiveness and cutting costs to preserve\r\n\r\njobs for our workers, would the Ministry be able to provide some\r\n\r\nindicators on how successful we have been, and how effective  is\r\n\r\nthe cost cutting package that was introduced?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has touched on\r\n\r\nthe  social problems of our foreign workers.  He says that there\r\n\r\nis  a  need to give better housing to foreign workers.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  touch  on  the  recreational  activities  for  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign workers are now a common sight in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe see them in all construction sites, whether public or private\r\n\r\nones.   We  see them in all our shipyards.  We see them  in  our\r\n\r\nfactories and in our homes.  Singapore would not have been  able\r\n\r\nto  make  such great economic progress if it were  not  for  the\r\n\r\nlabour  contributed  by foreign workers.   We  can  see  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers   on  weekends  congregating  at  different   parts   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  depending on where they came from.  On  Sundays,  we\r\n\r\nsee  the  Indian foreign workers gathering at the Tek Kah  area.\r\n\r\nThe  Thai workers congregate at Beach Road Golden Mile area, and\r\n\r\nthe Filipino maids gathering at Lucky Plaza at Orchard Road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there are no sporting, recreational or\r\n\r\ncultural programmes organised for them.  They just loiter around\r\n\r\nin  those places.  Some sit at whatever places they can find  on\r\n\r\nthe roadside, on railings or public chairs, if there are any  in\r\n\r\nthe  vicinity.  They have nowhere to go.  Their wages  are  low.\r\n\r\nThey  do not have any spare money to spend.  Whatever spare cash\r\n\r\nthey  have is probably sent home to their impoverished  families\r\n\r\nin their own countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is estimated to collect about $21.6 million\r\n\r\non   fees  and  charges  in  FY99.   Much  of  this  money   are\r\n\r\ncontributions by the employers of foreign workers.  I  think  it\r\n\r\nis  equitable or fair that some of these funds, say,  about  2%,\r\n\r\nshould  be ploughed back to the foreign workers in the  form  of\r\n\r\norganised,   recreational,   sporting,   social   or    cultural\r\n\r\nactivities.   As  it  is, nothing is done  for  foreign  workers\r\n\r\noutside their working hours, except for the efforts of the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember,  Mr Loh Meng See, who was reported in the press to  have\r\n\r\norganised   sports  and  games  for  foreign  workers   in   his\r\n\r\nconstituency  at Kampong Glam.  I congratulate Mr  Loh  for  his\r\n\r\nconcern for the foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reported that crime is on the rise in Singapore and\r\n\r\nmany  instances of crimes are committed by foreign  workers.  If\r\n\r\nsomething could be done to keep them occupied, the incidence  of\r\n\r\ncrime involving foreign workers may drop.  I urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  put  some funds aside from the levies collected to  organise\r\n\r\nextra-curricular  activities  for  foreign  workers.   The   ECA\r\n\r\noutside  their working hours shall not only keep foreign workers\r\n\r\naway  from  doing  mischief but also probably make  them  better\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I share the sentiments of Mr Chiam\r\n\r\nand Mr Yeo who spoke earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the foreign workers are helping in the economic life\r\n\r\nof Singapore.  Just imagine if these foreign workers were not to\r\n\r\nwork  for  one week, I think our housing estates will be  dirty.\r\n\r\nConstruction  sites  will  come  to  a  standstill.    We   must\r\n\r\nappreciate the contribution made by these foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two areas which I would like to touch - recreation and employment. Sir, there are certain games and\r\n\r\nsports which are not very expensive, for example, Kabadi for the\r\n\r\nIndian and Bangladeshi workers.  All they require is a field. No\r\n\r\nother  equipment is required.  Could we help them  by  providing\r\n\r\nthem grounds where these activities could be taken?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go one step further. The employers should be\r\n\r\nencouraged  to have small recreational areas at the construction\r\n\r\nsites.  I pleaded with the Minister for Information and the Arts\r\n\r\nfor  programmes in Thai and Bangla.  Unfortunately, he said that\r\n\r\nit  was  not possible.  We must think of these poor workers  who\r\n\r\nare  away  from their homes.  They are lonely.  They work  hard.\r\n\r\nThey must be given some opportunity to relax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturdays and Sundays, they gather at the various\r\n\r\nplaces, as has been told to this House, but what about the other\r\n\r\nworking  days?  Can we do something?  I would urge the  Manpower\r\n\r\nMinistry to work closely with the employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another area on which I have spoken earlier, but I\r\n\r\nam  going to repeat my plea and I hope that it will not fall  on\r\n\r\ndeaf  ears.  This is on foreign workers who have been  exploited\r\n\r\nby   some unscrupulous agents in Singapore.  These workers  come\r\n\r\nhere and they work for one or two months and then they find  the\r\n\r\ncompanies are closed and they have no jobs.  The next thing that\r\n\r\nfollows is that they have to pack and be sent to their countries\r\n\r\nof origin.  Could we allow these workers a slightly  longer stay\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  so  that they could look for  other  employment?\r\n\r\nThey  have  paid huge sums of money, often selling or mortgaging\r\n\r\ntheir land.  $4,000 may not be a big figure  for us.   But  when\r\n\r\nwe  convert this into Indian Rupees or Bangladeshi currency,  it\r\n\r\nis  much  higher.   I  will  go one step  further  and  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinistry: can we have a job placement body in the Ministry which\r\n\r\ncould  help  these foreign workers?  They are  helping  us.   We\r\n\r\nshould help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir, may I\r\n\r\nrespond  to  Mrs  Yu-Foo  Yee Shoon, Chairman  of  the  GPC  for\r\n\r\nManpower,  and the other Members who have spoken on the  subject\r\n\r\nof manpower planning, foreign talent and foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On manpower planning, the first point that I want to make\r\n\r\nis that we have a small workforce of about 2 million.  The local\r\n\r\nworkforce grows at around 45,000, maybe 50,000, a year,  as  the\r\n\r\nnew  entrants  join the labour force.  Between  1987  and  1997,\r\n\r\ntotal  employment creation in Singapore grew rapidly from  about\r\n\r\n70,000  in 1987 to a high of 120,000 in 1997.  This resulted  in\r\n\r\npersistent  shortage of workers and explained the chronic  tight\r\n\r\nlabour  market situation in Singapore.  Of course,  the  current\r\n\r\nsituation  is  a  complete  reversal.   Owing  to  the  regional\r\n\r\neconomic crisis and its impact on Singapore, we have seen rising\r\n\r\nunemployment  and  a record high number of retrenchments.   Last\r\n\r\nyear,  1998,  we  suffered a net job loss of  23,400  jobs,  and\r\n\r\nunemployment rose to 4.3% in December last year.  For this year,\r\n\r\nthe  employment situation is likely to continue to remain  weak,\r\n\r\nwith employment growth either flat or possibly negative.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, manpower planning is about managing and balancing the\r\n\r\nsupply  and  demand  of manpower for the  economy.   We  aim  to\r\n\r\nbalance  at  the national level manpower demand from  industries\r\n\r\nand  manpower supply from both local and foreign sources, so  as\r\n\r\nto  sustain  economic  growth and to optimise  the  use  of  our\r\n\r\navailable manpower resource.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Manpower Planning Division is new to my Ministry.\r\n\r\nMOM   is  now  the  central  coordinating  manpower  agency  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We  have  adopted a holistic approach  to  manpower\r\n\r\nplanning  needs.   This is done in close partnership  with  many\r\n\r\nother   Government  Ministries  and  agencies.   MOM  has   also\r\n\r\nappointed  academics  from NUS and NTU to  help  us  to  develop\r\n\r\nrelevant models to guide policy decisions.  I note what Mr  Chay\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier on about the fact that many other  countries'\r\n\r\nexperience  in manpower planning has always turned up  short  of\r\n\r\nexpectation, and they have in many cases gone wrong.   Even  our\r\n\r\nown  university, according to Mr Chay, has not come up with good\r\n\r\nlong term projections for manpower demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task of manpower planning is not easy. It is going to\r\n\r\nbe a very difficult task.  To hit the target right every time is\r\n\r\nnot  going to be easy.  But that does not mean we should not  do\r\n\r\nanything.  That does not mean we should just leave it on its own\r\n\r\nto  muddle through.  We, of course, are also studying how  other\r\n\r\ncountries  are  tackling their manpower  planning  issues.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, in the US, the US Bureau of Labour and Statistics  has\r\n\r\na  long  experience  and long history of carrying  out  manpower\r\n\r\nplanning.  They have well-established methodologies as  well  as\r\n\r\nmanpower research and training programmes. We will seek to learn\r\n\r\nfrom  these  more  established  manpower  planning  agencies  in\r\n\r\noverseas countries and to tap on their experience.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this effort by my Ministry to develop a manpower\r\n\r\nplanning  model for Singapore is still at an early stage,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid I will not be able to provide Members with details.   But\r\n\r\nI  would like to assure Members that our objective is to  gather\r\n\r\nas  much  information as possible to provide timely and relevant\r\n\r\ninformation on manpower and skills demand and supply for  better\r\n\r\nmanagement  of our workforce.  We will release this  information\r\n\r\nto  the  public in our regular employment outlook reports  which\r\n\r\nwill  touch on the industry's specific trends.  However, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nmust  point  out that manpower planning in itself cannot  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there will be sufficient jobs for all Singaporeans.  These\r\n\r\nwill  have to depend on the performance of the economy  and  the\r\n\r\nresulting  job creation.  Manpower planning can help  us  to  be\r\n\r\nmore responsive to changes and to deploy workers to growth areas\r\n\r\nwhere  jobs  are  still being created.  This  includes  a  clear\r\n\r\nidentification  and projection of areas of employment  creation,\r\n\r\nanalysis of areas of supply shortages and surpluses, and also  a\r\n\r\nwide ranging skills upgrading and workers' retraining programmes\r\n\r\nto bridge the skills gap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has also asked for an update on\r\n\r\nthe  Manpower  21 Committee's effort.  This was  the  initiative\r\n\r\nlaunched by my Ministry in June last year.  The objective is  to\r\n\r\nformulate a strategy for the development of Singapore's manpower\r\n\r\ncapability to forge a globally competitive workforce.  The study\r\n\r\nteam  includes some 100 top businessmen, captains of  industries\r\n\r\nand  civil  servants who have held many in-depth discussions  on\r\n\r\nmanpower  issues confronting us today.  Some Members  have  even\r\n\r\nmade study tours overseas to learn about how other countries are\r\n\r\ngoing  about  in  their  human resource development  and  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading for their own workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, their findings and recommendations are being\r\n\r\nrigorously debated within the Committee itself and refined.   At\r\n\r\nthis  juncture, I would just like to provide Members  with  some\r\n\r\nindication  of  some of the key ideas which have come  out  from\r\n\r\nthese discussions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the concept of a school of life-long learning.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a national framework to enable every Singaporean\r\n\r\nto  pick up new skills in order to enjoy lifelong employability.\r\n\r\nThere  are altogether six key features of the school of lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning.  First, recognition.  Life-long learning must lead  to\r\n\r\nrecognition for the skills gained. There must be incentives  and\r\n\r\nthis should be employer and also individual-based incentives  to\r\n\r\nencourage  employers and workers to pool their  effort  to  send\r\n\r\ntheir workers for skills upgrading and retraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to develop a network of learning or training\r\n\r\nproviders,  both  public institutions and also private  learning\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  so  that any worker who wants to  go  for  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  will be able to have the opportunity.  We  must  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  technology. We must tap technology to  make  sure  that\r\n\r\ntraining  or  skills upgrading opportunities can  be  made  more\r\n\r\naccessible  to workers.  For instance, we should tap  electronic\r\n\r\nlearning  (e-learning) through the Internet so that workers  can\r\n\r\nperhaps study either at home or even at community centres  where\r\n\r\nsuch equipment can be provided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should facilitate workers' access to career development,\r\n\r\nto  job  opportunities and to training available, and  also  the\r\n\r\nkind of funding that Government can give to support such workers\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, we must have a sustained strategic\r\n\r\nmarketing plan to continually encourage and motivate workers  to\r\n\r\ngo for such skills upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next idea that has been developed is this concept of\r\n\r\ndeveloping  a  manpower  industry in  Singapore.   The  manpower\r\n\r\nindustry  is defined as a cluster of companies involved  in  the\r\n\r\ntotal development of Singapore's manpower and talent capability.\r\n\r\nThis  includes  both public institutions and  private  companies\r\n\r\nsuch as management schools and human resource consultancies.  We\r\n\r\nintend  to  work  closely  with  this  cluster  and  to  develop\r\n\r\norganisations and institutions and companies so that they  would\r\n\r\nbe able to contribute more to Singapore's manpower\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  The manpower industry has the potential to  become\r\n\r\na new growth industry serving both domestic and regional needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third idea that has cropped up from the discussion by\r\n\r\nthe Manpower 21 Committee is to prepare for the workplace of the\r\n\r\nfuture and the need to strengthen tripartite relationship.  Sir,\r\n\r\nas the concept of work is changing on a global scale, we need to\r\n\r\nbuild  new infrastructure that will enable more people  to  work\r\n\r\nfrom  home or within their communities.  Welfare structures such\r\n\r\nas safety at work, industrial health, workmen's compensation and\r\n\r\nemployment  coverage  would have to be reviewed  to  respond  to\r\n\r\nthese  changes.   At the same time, this would be  an  excellent\r\n\r\nopportunity for us to strengthen tripartite relationship at both\r\n\r\nthe national and enterprise level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides these key ideas here, there are still many\r\n\r\nothers being discussed and refined by the Manpower 21 Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Committee expects to complete its work by June this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has also raised the point about\r\n\r\nmissing foreign workers and the disputes between foreign workers\r\n\r\nand their employers.  Yes, there has been an increasing trend of\r\n\r\nmissing  foreign  workers, particularly  from  the  Indian  sub-Continent.   Most  of  these  workers,  in  fact,  are  here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore working in the construction industry.  Apart from more\r\n\r\nenforcement  actions  to  round  up  such  missing  workers  and\r\n\r\noverstayers, we will also try to introduce new deterrents.  Part\r\n\r\nof the problem of missing workers is, in fact, as pointed out by\r\n\r\nMr Rai, because some employers exploit and take advantage of the\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  So they run away.  What we want to do  is  to\r\n\r\ntry  and  minimise this possibility of employers exploiting  the\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  So with effect from 1st April this  year,  we\r\n\r\nare going to introduce a measure whereby employers who have more\r\n\r\nthan  two missing non-traditional source workers within the same\r\n\r\ncalendar  year will not be allowed to employ new non-traditional\r\n\r\nsource  workers for a certain period of time.  This is to compel\r\n\r\nemployers to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbetter manage and better look after their non-traditional source\r\n\r\nworkers  so  that they do not run away or abscond and  therefore\r\n\r\nput  the  employer in a corner whereby he can no longer  recruit\r\n\r\nany new non-traditional source workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been a sharp increase in the number of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  making claims against the employers  over  the\r\n\r\nlast  few  years.   In  fact, in 1998, close  to  7,000  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  made claims against their employers, mostly  on  salary\r\n\r\narrears.  Almost all the claims that we investigated turned  out\r\n\r\nto  be  valid.   In other words, the contractors have,  in  most\r\n\r\ncases,  attempted to cheat or deprive these foreign  workers  of\r\n\r\nsome  salaries.   These  are the ones who  regularly  flout  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act.  We take a very serious view of  employers  who\r\n\r\ntry to cheat their foreign workers or to take advantage of them.\r\n\r\nSo  employers who blatantly disregard or violate the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct  will not be allowed to apply for new work permits or  renew\r\n\r\nexisting work permits for their foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I come to Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Member for Bukit Timah\r\n\r\nGRC.   He  asked  whether in our streamlining of the  employment\r\n\r\npass   system   into   a  PQR  system,  we  have   inadvertently\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged  a  group  of  skilled or  talented  workers  from\r\n\r\noverseas who are now granted Q2 employment pass.   My answer  to\r\n\r\nhim is no.  Although we do have salary criteria or guidelines, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  I  had,  in a previous sitting in this House,  informed\r\n\r\nMembers  that  the salary yardsticks are just guidelines.   They\r\n\r\nare not rigid criteria which we use to exclude people who do not\r\n\r\nmeet our salary guidelines.  In fact, what is more important  is\r\n\r\nthe  foreigner's education, work experience and  the  nature  of\r\n\r\njobs  that he or she will be doing in Singapore.  We do not just\r\n\r\ngrant  employment  pass  purely on  the  basis  of  the  current\r\n\r\nearnings  of  an  applicant.  We will look into  the  real  work\r\n\r\nexperience and the qualification.  So let me assure him that the\r\n\r\nnew   PQR   system  does  not  intentionally  or   inadvertently\r\n\r\ndiscriminate against this group.  In fact, for those who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  well  qualified, they will be granted either a P employment\r\n\r\npass  or a Q1 employment pass, which allows them the benefit  of\r\n\r\nbringing in their dependants. Those who are presently granted Q2\r\n\r\nare  not  because  they are earning a lower income  but  because\r\n\r\ntheir  skill  criteria and qualifications lie in the  borderline\r\n\r\nregion,  and we want to let them work here for a period of  time\r\n\r\nfor  a proper assessment.  So they can subsequently re-apply for\r\n\r\na  higher category of employment pass if their employer supports\r\n\r\ntheir application.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang said he supports our foreign talents policy, but he\r\n\r\ncautioned  against granting PR too readily.   Let  me  say  that\r\n\r\nforeign  talents  come to Singapore for a variety  of  purposes.\r\n\r\nSome come here to experience our culture and to work in an Asian\r\n\r\nenvironment for a period of time.  Others come clearly with  the\r\n\r\nhope of sinking roots in Singapore.  Whether they are here for a\r\n\r\nshort stay or a long stay, I think, is not that important.  What\r\n\r\nis important is that while they are here, they are making a real\r\n\r\ncontribution to our economy.  They are really helping us  to  be\r\n\r\nmore competitive and to grow the economic pie.  I think that  is\r\n\r\nmore  important.  So what matters is, during the period of  stay\r\n\r\nthey  contribute to Singapore's economic well being.  Those  who\r\n\r\nwant to stay in Singapore and to sink roots here, and those whom\r\n\r\nwe feel that we need and welcome, we should consider them for PR\r\n\r\nbecause  they  will  add  to  the  richness  and  strength   and\r\n\r\ncapabilities of our workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the eligibility for PR of foreigners, whether they are\r\n\r\nhere  working  first  on employment pass or  they  are  applying\r\n\r\ndirectly  for PR, is thus determined to a large extent by  their\r\n\r\nability to contribute to Singapore's economic capability,  their\r\n\r\nassimilability  and  their commitment to  our  national  effort.\r\n\r\nOver  time,  such  migrants will also become true  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nlike  many  of our forefathers.  They can help us to compete  in\r\n\r\nthe  economic  arena and contribute to social cohesion.   So  we\r\n\r\nshould not deny ourselves of this source of talents, this source\r\n\r\nof new migrants, by slowing down the issue of PR unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to Mr Chiam who said that he supports that\r\n\r\nin  the  period of high growth, Government should not limit  the\r\n\r\nentry  of  foreign  talents to Singapore.  He  asked  about  the\r\n\r\nHongkongers who have been granted approval in principle to  come\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.   I  do  not have the specific  figures  with  me\r\n\r\nbecause PR is actually a Ministry of Home Affairs' matter.   And\r\n\r\nif  he  wants the specific numbers, he should raise the question\r\n\r\nwith  the Minister for Home Affairs.  But I understand  that  we\r\n\r\nhave   offered  25,000  approvals  in  principle  for   PR   for\r\n\r\nHongkongers.   Quite  a  large number of applications  had  been\r\n\r\nreceived since it was offered in 1989.  But as to the number  of\r\n\r\nfamilies  who  have  relocated here, it  has  only  been  a  few\r\n\r\nthousand families.  It is not such a large number.  And the fact\r\n\r\nthat  soon  after the hand-over, Hong Kong was very  stable  and\r\n\r\ndeveloping  very  well, there was very little justification  for\r\n\r\nHongkongers  to want to uproot themselves, which makes  it  even\r\n\r\nmore difficult for us to attract them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point he made was quite similar to the point made\r\n\r\nby  Dr  Tan Cheng Bock last week, that we should not be  talking\r\n\r\nabout  attracting foreign talent at this stage while the economy\r\n\r\nis  down  and unemployment is high.  Basically he supported  the\r\n\r\npoint  made  last  Monday by Dr Tan that the  Government  should\r\n\r\nthink Singaporeans first.  Sir, let me explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is fully aware of the difficulties faced by\r\n\r\nthe  people during this economic recession.  We understand  that\r\n\r\nindividuals  may  have  difficulty understanding  the  need  for\r\n\r\nforeign talent when they are jobless or they are without job for\r\n\r\nsome  months  after graduation.  It is only very tempting  under\r\n\r\nsuch  circumstances to press the Government to turn off,  or  at\r\n\r\nleast  reduce, efforts to attract foreign talent,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nprotect our citizens and to give them a better chance.   Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain  why I believe this would hurt us in the long  term  and\r\n\r\nwill not solve our immediate problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic crisis is the manifestation of the inescapable\r\n\r\nfact  that the world is changing, and changing rapidly.  We  are\r\n\r\nnow  seeing the removal of geographical and regulatory  barriers\r\n\r\nto the movement of people and capital.  This changing world will\r\n\r\nnot  stop for us to catch our breath.  We cannot bury our  heads\r\n\r\nin  the sand and wish away reality.  And the reality is that  in\r\n\r\nthe 21st century, nations which succeed are those which are able\r\n\r\nto  capitalise  on  their intellectual and human  capital.   The\r\n\r\nbasis  of  competition will be a country's collective knowledge,\r\n\r\nexpertise, creativity and entrepreneurialship.  With a workforce\r\n\r\nof  less than 2 million people, compared to the teeming millions\r\n\r\nin  the  other cities in the world or in the region, and we  are\r\n\r\nnot  talking about countries, we are just comparing cities  with\r\n\r\ncities,  it is very difficult for us, with less than  2  million\r\n\r\nworkers,  to outdo our competitors, based solely on the  efforts\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans alone.  We will not have the critical mass  nor\r\n\r\nthe  resources  to succeed on our own.  We have to  build  up  a\r\n\r\ncritical mass by supplementing our local talent with a  flow  of\r\n\r\ninternational talent to enable Singapore to compete successfully\r\n\r\nin  the  global market.  We must position ourselves as a  talent\r\n\r\ncapital where Singaporeans and foreign talent work side by  side\r\n\r\nto create wealth for all to share.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, foreign talent is thus a critical element in our\r\n\r\nstrategy for future success.  And, indeed, it becomes even  more\r\n\r\ncritical   and  more  crucial  during  this  economic  downturn.\r\n\r\nRecently,  two  of  our largest banks (DBS and  OCBC)  recruited\r\n\r\nforeigners  for their CEOs.  This was a strategic move  by  both\r\n\r\nbanks  to  bring  in  the  best  men  in  preparation  for   new\r\n\r\ncompetition when our banking and financial sector will be thrown\r\n\r\nopen  to  international competition.  Such foreign talents,  and\r\n\r\nmany  more like them, are helping Singapore companies to weather\r\n\r\nthe   recession,  reorganise  their  operations  and  reposition\r\n\r\nthemselves for new competition and opportunities.  In doing  so,\r\n\r\nthey will create more jobs for Singaporeans.  Attracting foreign\r\n\r\ntalent   can   enhance   our  workforce's  competitiveness   and\r\n\r\ncapabilities in many new areas.  It is about bringing in  people\r\n\r\nwho\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan make the difference and hence we need them all the more in a\r\n\r\nperiod of economic decline or downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have been here helping us to compete all\r\n\r\nthese  years,  we  should not chase them  away.   While  overall\r\n\r\nemployment  may  be  shrinking, limiting the  entry  of  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  or  asking those who are here to leave will not  protect\r\n\r\nSingaporeans nor solve our employment problems.  Indeed, if  you\r\n\r\nprevent company from hiring foreign talent, it may result in its\r\n\r\nrelocation elsewhere.  Many MNCs operating in Singapore also run\r\n\r\nother  operations  in the region in our neighbouring  countries,\r\n\r\nfor  instance.   If  we restrict the access to foreign  workers,\r\n\r\nthey can easily relocate to other countries where labour is more\r\n\r\nreadily available and at a much lower cost.  This will result in\r\n\r\nmore Singaporeans being retrenched.  For one local job protected\r\n\r\nin  the short term, many more local jobs will be at risk in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Caltex announced the shift of their global\r\n\r\nheadquarters  to Singapore.  Suppose Caltex had been  told  they\r\n\r\ncould  only  recruit  Singaporeans, which must  be  the  logical\r\n\r\nextension of the \"Think Singaporeans First\" policy, do you think\r\n\r\nCaltex  would  have made the decision to relocate to  Singapore?\r\n\r\nIs  it  better  for  Singapore  to have  Caltex  operating  from\r\n\r\nSingapore with foreign talent or to have Caltex located in  some\r\n\r\nother  cities,  perhaps  in the region,  competing  against  our\r\n\r\neffort to build up global oil trading business from Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are in a race for talent, and losing the race will\r\n\r\nnot  help  our  citizens.  It will hamper economic recovery  and\r\n\r\nfuture  growth  prospects.  If we do  not  accumulate  the  best\r\n\r\ntalent  we  can find from around the world, they will simply  be\r\n\r\ndrawn elsewhere to compete against us.  Instead of stopping  the\r\n\r\nflow  of foreign talent, therefore, we need, in fact, to try  to\r\n\r\nposition  Singapore as an attractive place for them to work  and\r\n\r\nlive  in.   The fact remains that even in the midst of  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis, there are still areas which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  critically  short  of talent and  need  to  supplement  our\r\n\r\ninadequate local supply with a flow of foreign talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area is the IT industry, which today's newspaper\r\n\r\nhappens  to  highlight by coincidence.  We  are  well  ahead  of\r\n\r\nothers  in this region in the IT industry because we have always\r\n\r\nwelcomed  foreign  talent.  Out of the current  stock  of  about\r\n\r\n30,000  practising  IT professionals, more  than  30%  are  non-Singaporeans.  Without these foreign talents, we will not be  an\r\n\r\nIT  leader  in  the region.  Every year, out of the  demand  for\r\n\r\nabout  3,000  new  IT professionals, our local universities  and\r\n\r\npolytechnics can only supply about 2,000, leaving a shortfall of\r\n\r\n1,000.   That  is why they are being paid so much.   Competition\r\n\r\nfor IT talent is global and intense.  Every country in the world\r\n\r\ntoday  faces a shortage of IT professionals, as Mr Rai correctly\r\n\r\npointed out.  Even the United States is short of IT talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area is the telecommunications and media where it\r\n\r\nis  inconceivable that global broadcasters and media  companies,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  CNBC  and ABN, would want to base their operations  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  if  they  are  not  allowed  to  bring  in   talented\r\n\r\nbroadcasters and media specialists from around the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the advertising and the PR industry, Singapore has again\r\n\r\nbenefited tremendously from the infusion of foreign talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R&D is yet another example. A good example which shows\r\n\r\nthat  opening our doors to talent from abroad also means  making\r\n\r\nit  more attractive for our own Singaporeans and ex-Singaporeans\r\n\r\noverseas who have distinguished themselves in other countries to\r\n\r\nreturn  and to lend their considerable experience and  expertise\r\n\r\nto  our  cause.   I  give you an example  of  our  Institute  of\r\n\r\nMolecular and Cell Biology (IMCB) which would not be what it  is\r\n\r\ntoday  without Prof. Chris Tan, then an ex-Singaporean  whom  we\r\n\r\nattracted back from the US.  And not only did he establish  IMCB\r\n\r\nas  a world-class institution, he created exciting R&D jobs  for\r\n\r\nmany  other  Singaporeans  and  foreign  talent  also.   Another\r\n\r\nexample is Dr Chua\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNam Hai of the Institute of Molecular Agrobiology (IMA).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the efforts and leadership of these two people and\r\n\r\nmany others like them, we have been able to attract more talent.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  the  IMCB and IMA had succeeded to make  breakthrough\r\n\r\nfindings  in cancer research and also in agrobiology.  IMA,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  had filed patents on at least 13 areas which  are  of\r\n\r\ncommercial value.  So these people not only contributed in their\r\n\r\nown  work  areas  but they also created more  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nother Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge facing Singapore in the next millennium is to\r\n\r\nreinvent   ourselves  into  a  country  where  there  are   many\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  Singaporeans to  develop  to  their  fullest\r\n\r\npotential.   We  can  become  a globally  competitive  knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy  with a world-class workforce.  But to do  so,  we  must\r\n\r\ndevelop  our  people  to their fullest potential  and  add  that\r\n\r\nlittle  extra boost which can come from bringing in  a  flow  of\r\n\r\nforeign  talent, who bring with them new ideas,  new  experience\r\n\r\nand  new  network connections.  If we fail in this  undertaking,\r\n\r\nnot  only  will  foreign talent not come to Singapore,  our  own\r\n\r\ntalented  Singaporeans  may  well  look  elsewhere  for  greener\r\n\r\npastures,  and  I  think  that  would  be  a  greater  loss  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government will ensure that our own citizens are\r\n\r\nprovided  with every means to compete with foreign talent  on  a\r\n\r\nlevel playing field.  We will invest in manpower development  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  our  workers'  capability  to  compete.   For  example,\r\n\r\ninformation  technology is an area where there  are  still  many\r\n\r\njobs  available.  It is likely to be one of the few sectors that\r\n\r\nwill have a positive job creation this year.  MOM will implement\r\n\r\na Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme to train professionals\r\n\r\nfrom other disciplines in IT skills and to prepare them for jobs\r\n\r\nin  the IT sector.  The EDB also has a programme called Training\r\n\r\nand   Attachment  Programme  to  train  young  local   engineers\r\n\r\noverseas, so that they can acquire new capabilities in order  to\r\n\r\nmeet the needs of the economy when it recovers.  But we must  be\r\n\r\nprepared to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsubject  ourselves  to  the  discipline  of  the  market   where\r\n\r\nemployers are free to choose the best man for the job, be  it  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean  or a foreign talent.  Only then can  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nworkforce  be truly competitive on a global basis.   Ultimately,\r\n\r\nforeign talent attraction and the development of our own  people\r\n\r\nare  not  competing alternatives.  It is not a  zero  sum  game.\r\n\r\nBoth  are  complementary strategies in our drive to survive  and\r\n\r\nprosper  in a very competitive global market.  This will  become\r\n\r\nmore  apparent  when  through  the  hard  work  and  efforts  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and foreign talent, the economy turns  around  and\r\n\r\nthere is a larger pie to share.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also thank Mr Rai for his strong support on our\r\n\r\neffort to attract foreign talent.  Let me assure him, as I  have\r\n\r\njust  explained,  that the development of our own  local  talent\r\n\r\nwill  certainly not be sacrificed.  We will continue to put more\r\n\r\nefforts  into developing our own talent so that they can compete\r\n\r\nwith the foreign talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to Mr Yeo Guat Kwang who spoke of the need to\r\n\r\ncontrol  our dependency on foreign workers.  I think Mr Yeo,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  was concerned with the construction industry  where\r\n\r\nwe  have nearly 200,000 foreign construction workers  here.  And\r\n\r\nhe  asked whether we will take steps to regulate their entry and\r\n\r\nto  encourage the industry to improve its productivity.  I think\r\n\r\nhe  has  touched  on  a real problem, because  the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry  is,  in  fact, one of the least  productive  industry.\r\n\r\nOver  the  years,  from 1995 to 1998, the  industry  saw  steady\r\n\r\ndecline   in   productivity.   Between  1995   and   1998,   the\r\n\r\nproductivity declined by 20%.  So there is really an urgent need\r\n\r\nto  get  the industry to turn around its approach in the way  it\r\n\r\nworks and operates, in order to raise its productivity.  That is\r\n\r\nwhy  we established a Construction 21 Committee to study how  we\r\n\r\ncan  help the industry to raise its productivity.  Some  of  the\r\n\r\nideas  that  are  being discussed by the Committee  include  the\r\n\r\npromotion    of   design-and-build   concept,   standardisation,\r\n\r\nmodularisation  of  components as well as the  use  of  off-site\r\n\r\nprefabricated components.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAlso the Ministry of National Development will introduce minimum\r\n\r\nbuildability requirement for construction projects in  order  to\r\n\r\nenhance their buildability and productivity.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the Construction 21 studies, we have also taken\r\n\r\nother  measures to address over reliance and over dependence  on\r\n\r\nforeign construction workers.  We have in fact lowered the  levy\r\n\r\nfor  the skilled construction workers while we maintain the levy\r\n\r\nfor the unskilled construction workers.  That means there is now\r\n\r\na  wider  differential, in fact, almost $440  for  each  foreign\r\n\r\nconstruction worker.  This has in fact given incentives  to  the\r\n\r\ncontractors  to bring in more skilled construction  workers  and\r\n\r\nthe  proportion  of skilled construction workers  has  increased\r\n\r\nfrom 12% in April 1998 to 23% in December 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also introduced basic skills certification\r\n\r\nrequirement  for  contractors who want to bring  in  their  non-traditional source construction workers.  As of August 1998,  we\r\n\r\nhave required contractors to bring in at least 20% of their  NTS\r\n\r\nworkers  with basic skills certificate, and we intend  to  raise\r\n\r\nthis  requirement.  By April 1999, it will  go  up  to  50%  and\r\n\r\neventually  100%.  In other words, every NTS worker coming  into\r\n\r\nSingapore  should have a basic skill certificate.   They  should\r\n\r\nhave  some basic construction skills.  We are also looking  into\r\n\r\nenhancing  the  level of this basic skill certificate  or  skill\r\n\r\nlevel  so that they are better construction workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo asked whether our new work permit allocation system\r\n\r\nfor   the  construction  sector  has  worked  or  achieved  this\r\n\r\nobjective.   Yes, the answer is that the new man-year allocation\r\n\r\nsystem  has introduced more discipline in the demand for foreign\r\n\r\nconstruction  workers, particularly, the NTS workers.   The  new\r\n\r\nsystem  helps  to  ensure  that the  main  contractors  exercise\r\n\r\nprudence  and discipline in assigning their man-year  allocation\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nentitlement for NTS workers to their sub-contractors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its introduction early last year, there has been a\r\n\r\n40% drop in the applications for work permit for non-traditional\r\n\r\nsource workers.  We cannot say it is all entirely due to the new\r\n\r\nman-year entitlement system because the industry has also slowed\r\n\r\ndown  during  this  period.   But the new  man-year  entitlement\r\n\r\nsystem  had  a large part to do with it because we  notice  that\r\n\r\nonly  about  1/3 of the man-year entitlement handed out  to  the\r\n\r\nmain  contractors  were  subsequently allocated  to  their  sub-contractors.    In  other  words,  the  main  contractors   have\r\n\r\nexercised  a  great deal of prudence and care in awarding  their\r\n\r\nallocations  to their sub-contractors.  This has resulted  in  a\r\n\r\nlower demand or fewer applications for work permit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also queried on the housing of foreign construction\r\n\r\nworkers.   This  is a problem only for the construction  sector,\r\n\r\nwhile  in  the  other sectors like manufacturing  and  services,\r\n\r\nhousing is not a problem.  In the construction sector, about 70%\r\n\r\nto  80% of the construction workers can be accommodated on site,\r\n\r\nbut   that  still  leaves  another  20%  to  30%  for  whom  the\r\n\r\ncontractors  have  to  find  off-site  accommodation.   We   are\r\n\r\nencouraging contractors to develop proper dormitory housing  for\r\n\r\ntheir  foreign  workers.   Some companies  have  taken  up  this\r\n\r\nproposal.   My  Ministry  will  continue  to  work  with   other\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies to set aside more land which can be used for\r\n\r\ndeveloping  dormitory housing to meet the needs of  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also asked whether contractors are facing\r\n\r\ndifficulties  as a result of our implementing a  levy  bond  and\r\n\r\nalso  our collection in the arrears of foreign worker  levy.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  problems faced by contractors  now,  especially\r\n\r\nwhen  the  economy is slowing down.  They may have  problems  in\r\n\r\npayment  or  delays so they may not be able to  meet  all  these\r\n\r\nrequirements,  particularly the foreign worker  levy.   We  will\r\n\r\nimplement all these measures with flexibility and understanding.\r\n\r\nCompanies that are required\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  furnish  the  levy  bond are usually those  that  have  been\r\n\r\nhabitually late in making the levy payment or the other new  and\r\n\r\nsmall companies without a proper track record.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will exercise flexibility to help genuine contractors to\r\n\r\ntide  over this difficult period.  We have made adjustments  and\r\n\r\nrefinements  to the implementation of the levy bond  so  that  a\r\n\r\ncontractor can be allowed to defer posting the bond, if  he  can\r\n\r\nshow  proof  that  he has ongoing projects and  that  there  are\r\n\r\npayments that are due to him which should overcome his cash-flow\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also been fairly flexible in collecting the arrears\r\n\r\nof  foreign worker levy from contractors who are in arrears  for\r\n\r\nsome  time, up to a couple of months.  As long as they can  show\r\n\r\nproof to us that they in fact have incoming payment, we can help\r\n\r\nthem to resolve the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mr Chiam who asked for more recreational\r\n\r\nfacilities  to  be  provided to foreign workers.   Mr  Rai  also\r\n\r\njoined  in  that  call.   Sir,  the  provision  of  leisure  and\r\n\r\nrecreational  facilities  to  foreign  workers   is   partly   a\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the  employers  and  partly  of   course   a\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  us  to  ensure that  there  are  sufficient\r\n\r\namenities  for  the foreign workers to enjoy.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  that in fact all social amenities in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nopen  and  available to foreign workers as well as Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nIt  must be so.  We do not prevent any foreign worker from using\r\n\r\nany  of the public facilities.  So to ask that some of the money\r\n\r\ncollected  from the foreign worker levy be set aside to  develop\r\n\r\namenities  or  recreational  facilities  specifically  for   the\r\n\r\nforeign  workers is simply not justified because the  collection\r\n\r\nof  the  levy is for a totally different purpose.  The  levy  is\r\n\r\ncollected  in  order to bridge the wage gap and to moderate  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  such  foreign workers and  not  to  provide  social\r\n\r\namenities  for  them.   The money that  is  collected  from  the\r\n\r\nforeign worker levy in fact goes into the consolidated fund  and\r\n\r\nit  is used to develop public infrastructure and amenities which\r\n\r\neventually will benefit not just Singaporeans but foreigners who\r\n\r\nare also working here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam, in particular, has pointed out that every\r\n\r\nweekend,  foreign  workers  loiter at  places  such  as  Botanic\r\n\r\nGardens,  Little India, Orchard Mall, Crawford Park  and  Rochor\r\n\r\nCentre.   But I think \"loiter\" is not the right word.   This  is\r\n\r\ntheir  day off.  They gather at these public areas with all  the\r\n\r\namenities  that  are available there, to gossip,  exchange  news\r\n\r\nwith each other about what is happening at home and to catch  up\r\n\r\nwith friends who are also working in Singapore.  Where there  is\r\n\r\nover  congestion, I agree that we have to find alternatives  for\r\n\r\nthem,  and  that  is what we have done.  For instance,  we  have\r\n\r\nrecently  opened  up  a Sunday bazaar at Weld  Road.   This  was\r\n\r\njointly  organised  by  the Police, the  Singapore  Contractors'\r\n\r\nAssociation and the Hindu Endowments Board.  The weekend  bazaar\r\n\r\nhas  been  held since November last year.  Activities  that  are\r\n\r\nheld  there  include screening of free movies by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nContractors'   Association  and  also  setting  up   stalls   by\r\n\r\nvolunteers from the Hindu Endowments Board.  The scheme  had  in\r\n\r\nfact  attracted quite a large number of foreign workers who used\r\n\r\nto  congregate in Little India to come over to Weld Road and  to\r\n\r\nreduce the congestion in places like Little India.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from public amenities, where feasible, employers\r\n\r\nshould  also  provide  recreational and welfare  facilities  for\r\n\r\ntheir  local and foreign workers.  I entirely agree with Mr  Rai\r\n\r\nthat  employers  cannot  just neglect their  responsibility  for\r\n\r\ntheir workers.  If the contractor provides accommodation for 70%\r\n\r\nto  80% of his workers on site, then he should also provide some\r\n\r\nrecreational facilities there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered the areas that have been raised so\r\n\r\nfar.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> Sir, the current economic downturn\r\n\r\nhas once again demonstrated the importance of having good labour-management  relations.  This has been made possible  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  strong emphasis on tripartism and the efforts made  by  all\r\n\r\nthree parties - the Government, employers and unions to work out\r\n\r\nproblems   peacefully   and  not  adopt   positions   that   are\r\n\r\nconfrontational or would lead to disharmony.  However, it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimportant  to  nurture and further develop this partnership  and\r\n\r\nnot  take it for granted.  One positive way of doing so  is  for\r\n\r\nMOM to support initiatives where the three parties can learn and\r\n\r\nshare  experiences together.  I would therefore like to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  MOM  consider  getting the Singapore Institute  of  Labour\r\n\r\nStudies  to  organise more courses and training  for  employers,\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  union  officials  together  to  give  them  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  learn and to share their  experiences.   And  I\r\n\r\nwould  therefore  also like to encourage  MOM  to  consider  its\r\n\r\nfunding  to support the SILS effort.  The Government  has  given\r\n\r\nthe  Institute  a once-off grant but I would like  to  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister   to   consider  the  possibility  of  reviewing   this\r\n\r\narrangement and provide grants once in three years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workforce profile continues to improve with better\r\n\r\neducation.  At present, 60% of new entrants to the workforce are\r\n\r\ntertiary-educated.  This means that the pool available for union\r\n\r\nmembership and leadership will shrink as traditionally only  the\r\n\r\nbargainable  employees join the unions.  This will have  serious\r\n\r\nrepercussions   on   tripartism  which  will   clearly   weaken.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is a need to review the current restrictions on\r\n\r\nexecutives  joining  unions.  For a start,  MOM  could  consider\r\n\r\nallowing   rank  and  file  unions  partial  representation   of\r\n\r\nexecutives  on  issues  such  as retrenchments  and  grievances.\r\n\r\nJapan  is  a  good example of sound labour-management relations,\r\n\r\nwhich had survived the turmoil faced by workers and employers in\r\n\r\nthe  prolonged  recession  that  the  country  is  facing.   One\r\n\r\nrelevant  feature  of  Japanese industrial  relations  that  has\r\n\r\ncontributed  significantly to this stability is the practice  of\r\n\r\nallowing  union leaders who are promoted to management ranks  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  remain in office.  This fusion  of  the  role  has\r\n\r\nallowed   both   management  and  labour  to   have   a   better\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of each other's role and has clearly  contributed\r\n\r\nto  the  peaceful labour-management relations in Japan.   Hence,\r\n\r\ncould  MOM look into this issue again and, if necessary, form  a\r\n\r\ntripartite\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommittee representing all the three parties to study the  issue\r\n\r\ncarefully and make the necessary recommendations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that at present, there is a committee to study\r\n\r\nthe  guidelines on this area.  But according to feedback, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  very satisfactory.  So we would like to urge MOM to  relook\r\n\r\nat  this  issue  urgently and hope that the  three  parties  can\r\n\r\nactively  participate in this area to come out  with  guidelines\r\n\r\nwhich are workable.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the subject of\r\n\r\ntripartite  partnership was discussed at length last  year  when\r\n\r\nthe  Nominated  Member, Mr Cyrille Tan, moved a motion  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  for  the  Government to recognise  tripartism  as  a  key\r\n\r\ncompetitive advantage for Singapore.  The Minister for Manpower,\r\n\r\nDr Lee Boon Yang, has also just touched on it a moment ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our unique tripartite setting is indeed the envy of many\r\n\r\ncountries and has worked marvellously for us.  However,  in  the\r\n\r\nwake of constant change and an increasingly competitive business\r\n\r\nenvironment, new situations will evolve which will  continue  to\r\n\r\ntest  the bond of the tripartite partners.  One that has  to  be\r\n\r\nborne  in mind is that businesses today, large and small  alike,\r\n\r\nare constantly challenged to deal with the flood of information,\r\n\r\nknowledge  and technology in all forms.  Unlike traditional  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials, knowledge usually is not coded, audited or stacked in\r\n\r\nstorerooms or warehouses for workers to use as needed.  It comes\r\n\r\nin  various  formats, scattered and is easy to  lose.   To  make\r\n\r\nknowledge  manageable  like  raw materials,  companies  need  to\r\n\r\ncapture and share knowledge that is in their workers' heads  and\r\n\r\nresiding  in their computers. Competitive advantage  is  derived\r\n\r\nwhen  companies are able to effectively turn these  into  assets\r\n\r\nthat  can be leveraged and into profitable products or services.\r\n\r\nIn  an  information and knowledge-based economy, this is  a  key\r\n\r\ningredient of business success.  Companies that manage knowledge\r\n\r\nmust have the ability not only to attract the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyoung  and the new breed of knowledge workers, but must also  be\r\n\r\nable  to retain them.  Such workers have the competency to  help\r\n\r\nthem  strategise, analyse markets and, more importantly, provide\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who fail to recognise the importance of this\r\n\r\nimminent  business landscape risk losing their best and valuable\r\n\r\nemployees.   This  could contribute to a  stifling  of  business\r\n\r\ngrowth  which,  in  turn, could translate into  slower  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.   This  is  where I believe that the tripartite  parties\r\n\r\ncould work together through regular meetings and interactions to\r\n\r\nanticipate  future trends and devise strategies to stablise  the\r\n\r\nemployment  of  knowledge  workers.   I  am  glad  to  note  the\r\n\r\nannouncement  made by the Minister for Manpower yesterday  about\r\n\r\nthe  consideration of an annual national Manpower  Summit  as  a\r\n\r\npotential  platform for the tripartite partners to get  together\r\n\r\nand  jointly  focus  on  strategic issues relating  to  manpower\r\n\r\ndevelopment and training needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from life-long learning, life-long partnership\r\n\r\nbetween workers and caring employers who invest heavily  in  the\r\n\r\neducation and training of their workers should also be seriously\r\n\r\nexplored.   At  the opposite end of this, it is also  my  belief\r\n\r\nthat  structural  unemployment  will  be  one  of  our  greatest\r\n\r\nchallenges in our pursuit of a knowledge-based economy.  It will\r\n\r\nbe  a  short and long-term problem for us.  An annual forum will\r\n\r\nalso  be  useful  in enabling us to regularly re-visit  and  re-strategise what needs to be done to minimise its impact.  Hence,\r\n\r\nI would urge the Minister to seriously consider the strong merit\r\n\r\nof  staging an annual forum to regularly review manpower  issues\r\n\r\nfacing Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I will focus on\r\n\r\nthe  extension of the scope of union representation.   With  the\r\n\r\ndecline  of  the  manufacturing sector,  the  expansion  of  the\r\n\r\nservice  sector  and  the spread of IT,  more  white-collar  and\r\n\r\nprofessional  jobs are created.  This change in the  profile  of\r\n\r\nour  workforce  will  continue unabated and  this  will  mean  a\r\n\r\nshrinking bargainable base for the labour movement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Ministry of Manpower has expressed that there was\r\n\r\nnothing  to  prevent companies from voluntarily  allowing  their\r\n\r\nexecutives  to  be  unionised, NTUC has adopted  the  persuasive\r\n\r\napproach  to  encourage employers to widen the  scope  of  union\r\n\r\nrepresentation.  To date, only 23 companies have initiated  such\r\n\r\nunion  representation extension.  However, it has not been  easy\r\n\r\nfor employers to adopt a magnanimous approach to allow executive\r\n\r\nstaff to join unions with open arms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we achieve such extension of union representation?\r\n\r\nA  Tripartite Committee can be formed at the national  level  to\r\n\r\nreview section 16(3) of the Industrial Relations Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, amend section 16(3) of the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nAct  to  allow  partial representation rights  over  executives.\r\n\r\nHere,  we accord union partial representation rights in  respect\r\n\r\nof  executives.  The latter will not enjoy the benefits  of  the\r\n\r\ncollective  agreements obtained for its rank and file colleagues\r\n\r\nbut  unions can represent them in grievances and other  specific\r\n\r\nproblems    such   as   dismissals,   unfair   treatments    and\r\n\r\nretrenchments.   This will help achieve some welfare  protection\r\n\r\nfor executives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, amend section 16(3) of the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nAct  to  admit  executives as ordinary members.   This  proposal\r\n\r\nwould  mean  that  executives could enjoy the  benefits  of  the\r\n\r\ncollective agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two above proposals can also have the right for\r\n\r\nexecutives  to vote and hold office in the Union.  This  can  be\r\n\r\nseen as a two-stage transition working towards full union rights\r\n\r\nfor executives while pursuing issues like conflict of interests.\r\n\r\nThe  proposals  can  be first adopted on a pilot  basis  at  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector.   Unions  and management can  differentiate  the\r\n\r\nextent  of  representation for different groups of workers.   It\r\n\r\nmay   reserve   the  right  to  take  up  issues  of   grievance\r\n\r\nrepresentation, retrenchment, etc. for some, while the  majority\r\n\r\ncan be covered by a more comprehensive collective agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the ability to extend the scope of union\r\n\r\nrepresentation  to  executives  is  important  to   the   labour\r\n\r\nmovement.  As each cohort of the population will be 60% tertiary\r\n\r\ntrained  (20%  university trained and 40% polytechnic  trained),\r\n\r\nour union membership can only be drawn from the remaining 40% of\r\n\r\nthe workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union membership is what the labour movement is all about.\r\n\r\nTo  reiterate, we need to arrest the shrinking bargainable  base\r\n\r\nby  extending our scope of representation in order to  make  our\r\n\r\nlabour movement a strong and relevant one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the Singapore model of the trade union movement\r\n\r\nwill  benefit  the workers, the companies and the country  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Eusofe):</b> Sir, the synergic relationships between the\r\n\r\nGovernment, employers and unions have worked well in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  tripartite alliance is the cornerstone of industrial peace\r\n\r\nfor  three decades.  It has also brought an environment that  is\r\n\r\nconducive to foreign investment and sustained economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the Members for Bukit Timah GRC and\r\n\r\nPasir Ris GRC that good industrial relations cannot be taken for\r\n\r\ngranted.   Tripartite cooperation will become even more  crucial\r\n\r\nin  the  present economic difficulties as companies  restructure\r\n\r\ntheir  organisation to become more cost-effective and to  remain\r\n\r\nmore  competitive,  and when workers face  wage  and  CPF  cuts.\r\n\r\nTripartism  has served us well in good times.  It is  even  more\r\n\r\nimportant  in  times  of economic adversities.   A  strong  bond\r\n\r\nbetween  the Government, employers and unions will  help  us  to\r\n\r\nweather the economic storm.  I agree with the Members that in  a\r\n\r\nrapidly changing and competitive business environment, the three\r\n\r\npartners   should   continue   to   strengthen   their   working\r\n\r\nrelationship   and   to   jointly  tackle  difficulties   ahead,\r\n\r\nparticularly the emerging\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproblems   of   structural  unemployment.   Through   tripartite\r\n\r\ncooperation,  we  can  also  prepare our  workforce  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  be globally competitive in the  knowledge-based\r\n\r\nera.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tripartism has worked in many areas. For example, through\r\n\r\nthe  support of the employers and the NTUC, we have  raised  the\r\n\r\ncompulsory retirement age from 60 to 62 years from January  this\r\n\r\nyear.   The  NWC  has  been able to reach  consensus  among  the\r\n\r\ntripartite  partners on the recommendation to reduce wage  costs\r\n\r\nby  between 5% and 8%, in addition to the cut in employers'  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  by 10 percentage points. It is not easy  to  reach\r\n\r\nconsensus  on such a difficult measure.  Our unions and  workers\r\n\r\nshould be commended for giving their unequivocal support to help\r\n\r\ncompanies  reduce  business costs so  that  we  can  regain  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness in the global market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of funding the Singapore Institute of\r\n\r\nLabour  Studies (SILS) as raised by the Member for  Bukit  Timah\r\n\r\nGRC,  my  Ministry  is  aware  that SILS  has  made  significant\r\n\r\ncontributions  to the labour movement by providing  training  to\r\n\r\nunion leaders and members. To support SILS' work and programmes,\r\n\r\nthe  Government had in the past given annual grants to  SILS  on\r\n\r\nthe basis of deficit funding.  However, to provide the necessary\r\n\r\nincentive  for  SILS  to  raise its own  funds,  the  Government\r\n\r\ndecided  to  give SILS a one-time matching grant of  $2  million\r\n\r\ninto  the  SILS  Endowment  Fund  as  from  FY96  based  on  the\r\n\r\nInstitute's  own  contribution  of  $2  million  to  this  fund.\r\n\r\nThrough  this  funding arrangement, it is hoped that  SILS  will\r\n\r\noperate  on  the basis of cost recovery in running its  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   This  practice  of annual  funding  was  therefore\r\n\r\ndiscontinued.   Nevertheless,  we  will  monitor   the   funding\r\n\r\narrangement and carry out a review if the need arises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the issue of union representation which\r\n\r\nhas been raised by Mrs Yu-Foo and Mr Cyrille Tan, in particular,\r\n\r\nthe question of allowing executives to join rank and file unions\r\n\r\nto enlarge the talent pool for union leaders.  While\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  appreciate  the  efforts  of  the  unions  to  expand  their\r\n\r\nmembership,   the   concerns   of   the   employers   on   union\r\n\r\nrepresentation  of  the  executives  must  not  be   overlooked.\r\n\r\nEmployers have expressed concerns that allowing their executives\r\n\r\nto  join  rank  and file unions would result in  a  conflict  of\r\n\r\ninterests.   Executives  who have to  make  critical  decisions,\r\n\r\nwhich  may  affect  their  fellow union  members,  may  find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult to effectively carry out their roles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Cyrille Tan and Mrs Yu-Foo have also raised the concern\r\n\r\nthat the current restriction of executives joining rank and file\r\n\r\nunions  under section 16(3) of the Industrial Relations Act  has\r\n\r\ndeprived  the  labour  movement of the ability  to  draw  future\r\n\r\nleaders from among a growing number of employees who are in  the\r\n\r\nexecutive positions.  This is particularly so when our workforce\r\n\r\nis  becoming better educated and most of the new entrants in the\r\n\r\nlabour movement join as junior and middle management personnel.\r\n\r\nWe agree that this issue of allowing executives to join rank and\r\n\r\nfile  unions  should  be  studied by an  appropriate  tripartite\r\n\r\nforum.   This is in line with our tripartite approach in dealing\r\n\r\nwith  the  important labour relations issues,  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\narriving at a solution that can best serve the interests of  the\r\n\r\neconomy,  employers  and workers.  I think  with  the  proposals\r\n\r\nwhich  we  are  considering, like having  an  annual  tripartite\r\n\r\nsummit  or  conference, these are issues which the  forum  could\r\n\r\ndiscuss.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the average unemployment\r\n\r\nrate  in Singapore has risen from 1.8% in 1997 to 3.2% in  1998.\r\n\r\nI  understand  that the seasonally adjusted figure for  December\r\n\r\n1998  has  already  reached  4.3%.  In  absolute  numbers,  this\r\n\r\ntranslates  to  about 89,000 being out of work.  However,  there\r\n\r\nare   more   than  450,000  foreign  workers  in  Singapore   in\r\n\r\noccupations   across   the   skills   spectrum,   from    80,000\r\n\r\nprofessionals and highly skilled workers to about  100,000  less\r\n\r\nskilled domestic workers.  Theoretically, there should be little\r\n\r\nreason  why unemployed Singaporeans should not be able  to  find\r\n\r\nemployment if they are willing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  moderate their expectations, or upgrade their skills to take\r\n\r\non  jobs  that  currently  have to be done  by  foreigners.  The\r\n\r\nfigures and projections also indicate that there will always  be\r\n\r\na  need  for foreign talent and less skilled foreign workers  to\r\n\r\nsupplement the local workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note the formation of the Manpower\r\n\r\nPlanning  Committee by the Ministry of Manpower.  But could  the\r\n\r\nMinister explain his Ministry's current policy, specifically  on\r\n\r\nthe   issue  of  work  permits versus the need  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nunemployed Singaporeans are able to find jobs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has also been said and done about skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  and retraining of lower skilled workers in order  for\r\n\r\nthem  to take on higher skilled jobs.  While I fully agree  with\r\n\r\nmy  GRC  colleague  that we should not aim to  be  a  nation  of\r\n\r\ntuckshop  girls  and  taxi drivers, I  think  we  must  also  be\r\n\r\nrealistic  in  our  expectations.    There  will  always  be   a\r\n\r\nproportion  of Singaporeans, especially older and less  educated\r\n\r\nworkers  who, despite their best efforts, will not  be  able  to\r\n\r\nmake  the grade into highly skilled professions due to  lack  of\r\n\r\nliteracy  skills or ability.  Decent jobs will also have  to  be\r\n\r\nfound  for them.  Is the Minister satisfied that enough is being\r\n\r\ndone  for this category of Singaporeans who may not be  able  to\r\n\r\ntake advantage of the skills upgrading programmes such as SRP?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In areas where lower skilled foreign workers are being used\r\n\r\nextensively, such as commercial cleaning and domestic  services,\r\n\r\nwhat  measures  are being taken by the Ministry of  Manpower  to\r\n\r\nencourage employers to enhance professionalism in these areas in\r\n\r\norder  to  make  these  occupations more productive  and  better\r\n\r\npaying   and,   consequently,  more  viable  for  less   skilled\r\n\r\nunemployed Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, to\r\n\r\nsoften the impact of the regional economic crisis on us, our key\r\n\r\nstrategy  is to focus on minimising unemployment and  maximising\r\n\r\nemployability.  Last year, the Government,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntogether  with various economic and social agencies, stepped  up\r\n\r\nits  programme  to  help our workers who were  affected  by  the\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore very important that these agencies keep\r\n\r\nabreast  of  the latest development in our labour situation,  in\r\n\r\norder  that they may tackle the issues at the earliest  possible\r\n\r\nopportunity.   Hence, I would like to request the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nManpower  to  provide  monthly  reports  on  job  creation   and\r\n\r\nopportunities in the various industries, so that NTUC can  match\r\n\r\nour workers with the vacancies in these industries concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that skilled workers are urgently\r\n\r\nrequired  in  the  new high-tech industries,  and  some  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers still do not possess the relevant skills to take on  the\r\n\r\nnew  technologies  involved.  However, there is  still  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of workers who seem to be unaware of the seriousness  of\r\n\r\nthis  crisis.   Many workers also do not realise that  the  jobs\r\n\r\nthey  have  lost today may not come back even when  the  economy\r\n\r\npicks up later on.  Therefore, we should do more to upgrade  the\r\n\r\nskills of our workers and to shift their mindset towards one  of\r\n\r\ncontinuous learning to move into the knowledge economy  that  we\r\n\r\nare  moving  towards.  Sir, may I know if the Manpower  Minister\r\n\r\nhas any innovative plans to overcome these challenges?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to request the Minister to enlighten us\r\n\r\non the following matters:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The proportion of new entrants into our workforce who\r\n\r\nare  gainfully  employed,  and the  proportion  that  is  under-employed.  Does the Ministry have any scheme in place to  assist\r\n\r\nthem  so  that they can be gainfully employed when  the  economy\r\n\r\npicks up?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) How many graduates from our tertiary institutions have\r\n\r\ndecided  to  further their education in view of the lull  labour\r\n\r\nmarket?   Is their delayed entry into the job market actually  a\r\n\r\npostponement of our employment problem?  With so many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadvanced learning institutions around, are they being trained in\r\n\r\nthe  required  skills, so that the under-unemployment  situation\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  aggravated after they have acquired their  higher\r\n\r\nqualifications?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Is the Minister satisfied with the success of MOM's \"job\r\n\r\nmatching\"  efforts?  Has the Ministry any proactive action  plan\r\n\r\nto  improve the success rate?  Can the Minister tell us how many\r\n\r\nworkers  have refused jobs offered to them despite being  placed\r\n\r\nseveral  times, and the number of companies which  rejected  the\r\n\r\njob- applicants recommended by the Ministry?  While looking  for\r\n\r\njobs,  are the workers' concern about inequitable pay  and  long\r\n\r\nhours  of  standing valid?  Is there any discrimination  against\r\n\r\nolder workers in the recruitment exercises?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Government's action to attract foreign\r\n\r\ntalents  who  could  add value to our economy  as  part  of  our\r\n\r\nstrategy  to  move towards a knowledge-based economy.   However,\r\n\r\nmay  I  ask  the Minister for Manpower what measures  have  been\r\n\r\ntaken  by his Ministry to attract local workers to these  higher\r\n\r\nvalue-added jobs, since these jobs will provide higher income?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, in the past year and\r\n\r\npossibly  this year, we expect to see record numbers  of  people\r\n\r\nbeing  retrenched  from work.  While many  people  are  able  to\r\n\r\nsupport  themselves  through their  savings  or  through  family\r\n\r\nsupport  until they find alternative employment, however,  there\r\n\r\nare  still a substantial number of Singaporeans who may  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to do so for a number of reasons.  I would like to propose\r\n\r\nto  the Minister that such families in trouble be allowed to use\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF savings during this time of difficulty.  My  proposal\r\n\r\nis  to allow retrenched workers to borrow from their CPF Special\r\n\r\nAccount  to  pay  for essential expenses like school  fees,  S&C\r\n\r\ncharges,  house  rentals and for purchase of basic  food  items.\r\n\r\nWhile  I agree that we should not change the fundamental purpose\r\n\r\nof the CPF, which is a saving for us after retirement, I do feel\r\n\r\nthat we need to put in place a system that allows us to ease the\r\n\r\nburden of the workers who are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin financial difficulties, especially during this time.  What  I\r\n\r\nam suggesting is not a permanent draw down from the CPF account,\r\n\r\nbut  to  treat  the transaction as a loan.  The mechanism  could\r\n\r\nwork as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Ministry can set criteria which allow\r\n\r\nworkers, who were retrenched and who have been out of a job  for\r\n\r\na minimum period of time, to borrow from their account.  Second,\r\n\r\nthe  money  borrowed  can be used only for certain  pre-approved\r\n\r\ntype  of  expenses.  Third, to set a limit for a maximum quantum\r\n\r\nto be borrowed and for a maximum of, say, six months so that the\r\n\r\nworker seriously looks for alternative employment.  Fourth, once\r\n\r\nthe  worker finds a new job, he has to repay the money  back  to\r\n\r\nhis  CPF account, which should include the amount borrowed  plus\r\n\r\ninterest  on the borrowed amount.  The payment can  be  made  in\r\n\r\ninstalments  to  ease  the burden on the worker,  and  repayment\r\n\r\ncould  be made through higher employee's CPF contribution  until\r\n\r\nthe amount borrowed is fully paid up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to emphasise that I am not advocating a\r\n\r\npermanent  withdrawal from the Fund, but a loan from  one's  own\r\n\r\naccount to be paid back with interest.  In this way, the  impact\r\n\r\non old-age savings will be almost none and, at the same time, we\r\n\r\nwill reduce the burden on the Government and the various welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  since  the worker now finds help  himself  first,\r\n\r\neliminating the need for welfarism.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, last year, about 28,000\r\n\r\nworkers  lost their jobs and indeed we had just learnt from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Manpower that there were  23,000  jobs  net  loss\r\n\r\nexperienced by December last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower has initiated a job assistance\r\n\r\nscheme  to  help  retrenched  workers  secure  alternative  jobs\r\n\r\nquickly.   Sir,  I  would like to know how  successful  has  the\r\n\r\nscheme  been, how many people have sought assistance  from  MOM,\r\n\r\neither  directly  on  their  own or  through  their  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  proportion who managed to get  jobs  through  the\r\n\r\nscheme,  and how successful have the job fairs which  have  been\r\n\r\norganised at the CDC level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is important for MOM to conduct a study on\r\n\r\nthe  retrenched workers, so that we know which types of  workers\r\n\r\nface  greater problems in getting alternative jobs.  In the past\r\n\r\nyear,  Members  of  Parliament  have  been  approached  by  more\r\n\r\nresidents to ask for help to get jobs.  Such cases are  referred\r\n\r\nto  MOM.   But from the replies given by MOM to these residents,\r\n\r\nit  appears  to me that some of the retrenched workers  did  not\r\n\r\ntake up the jobs offered to them.  Some did not even turn up for\r\n\r\nthe interviews to which they were invited.  The question is: how\r\n\r\nmany  have actually got jobs on their own by the time they  were\r\n\r\noffered  jobs  by  MOM?  Because many of these workers  are  low\r\n\r\nskilled  and  low  income and if they remain  unemployed  for  a\r\n\r\nlonger  period  of  time, their families  will  suffer.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore important for us to know why they did not take up  the\r\n\r\njobs  offered by  MOM, when, in the first place, they  were  the\r\n\r\nones  who sought assistance from  MOM through their MPs.  It  is\r\n\r\nimportant  to  understand  this as  we  will  continue  to  face\r\n\r\nunemployment and retrenchment problems even when the economy  is\r\n\r\ndoing well in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, this whole discussion on workers'\r\n\r\nand  skills  training in Singapore hinges on a set of  important\r\n\r\ncriteria  which, unless we address them, I am afraid the  effort\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  complete.   I  refer  to  the  importance  of  the\r\n\r\ntransferability  of  skills  and  certification,   through   the\r\n\r\nportability  of  the  skills  and  the  certification  and   the\r\n\r\nvisibility of the skills experienced and the certification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the transferability of skills and certification refers\r\n\r\nto  the recognition and credits we accord to various courses  or\r\n\r\nthe modules of training.  The different pathways should be given\r\n\r\nrecognition.  The portability of skills and certification refers\r\n\r\nto the equivalences that we establish to accept and compare with\r\n\r\nother  skills  certification from other places.   So,  different\r\n\r\npathways must be accepted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  be recognised.   For higher education, training is not just\r\n\r\nfor  the  elite.  Of course, every country has its own education\r\n\r\nand ranking system.  I am not suggesting that we dismantle them,\r\n\r\nbut  the important step is to establish the equivalences  across\r\n\r\nskills   training  and  certification,  perhaps  in  a   modular\r\n\r\nstructured way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have our NTCs and we are working towards the certificate\r\n\r\nof  competencies (COC) for our lower level workers  without  the\r\n\r\nNTC.   I believe this is the correct way to go.  We should  even\r\n\r\nextend   the   transferability   and   portability   of   skills\r\n\r\ncertification  across  the different pathways  of  training  and\r\n\r\neducation  in  Singapore.   In order  for  a  skill  set  to  be\r\n\r\ntransferable, portable or visible, we need to, firstly, identify\r\n\r\nthe  skill set.  The skill set may be made up of several modular\r\n\r\nskills  at  various  levels.  Such a modular  scheme  should  be\r\n\r\ndetermined as soon as possible, and the most basic of these  is,\r\n\r\nof  course,  our  certificate  of competencies.   Many  of  such\r\n\r\nworkers  at this level may not be literate in English,  but  may\r\n\r\nhave  many  years of working experience in technical  jobs,  and\r\n\r\nmany  of  them are well versed only in the Chinese language.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  we  should  not deny them.  I  hope  such  COC  can  be\r\n\r\ndetermined soonest to form the basis of our skills certification\r\n\r\nscheme.   And our NTC pathways to diploma and university degrees\r\n\r\nshould also be established.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a year ago, I had appealed for a constituent who was a\r\n\r\ntop  student  at  the ITE and at the Polytechnic,  but  was  not\r\n\r\nadmitted   to   the  University  here.   Only  the   enlightened\r\n\r\nintervention of the Senior Minister of State for Education  gave\r\n\r\nthis determined young man the chance to be admitted to study.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will consider this.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, the Skills Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme administered by the NTUC by and large addresses\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nretraining  of  workers who are still gainfully  employed.   The\r\n\r\nprogramme primarily supports employers who are sponsoring  their\r\n\r\nworkers  to upgrade their current skills or learn new skills  so\r\n\r\nthat   the   workers   can   contribute   towards   productivity\r\n\r\nimprovements  in  the company.  However, it is my  understanding\r\n\r\nthat workers who are retrenched and who have lost their jobs are\r\n\r\nnot  covered  by  this programme.  The Government,  through  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower, should consider extending the  surrogate\r\n\r\nemployer's programme to accommodate workers in this category  so\r\n\r\nthat  they could be retrained to learn new skills and find their\r\n\r\nrelevance in an increasingly sophisticated economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make training programmes more accessible, could I\r\n\r\nsuggest to the Minister for Manpower to consider the setting  up\r\n\r\nof  neighbourhood information centres in the HDB heartlands  for\r\n\r\nworkers,  especially  unemployed ones, to have  easy  access  to\r\n\r\ntraining  and  retraining information and how they  can  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom it, if this is not already being planned or done.  Wherever\r\n\r\nfeasible, the Ministry of Manpower should also consider  setting\r\n\r\nup  training  facilities in HDB neighbourhoods to make  training\r\n\r\nmore easily accessible, especially for the unemployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I share the concerns of\r\n\r\nMembers  in this House that our workers will be in for  a  tough\r\n\r\ntime  with employment, and especially employment that will yield\r\n\r\ngood  economic returns.  I am also worried that with  the  rapid\r\n\r\nrestructuring  of our economy, our workers could  be  caught  by\r\n\r\nlong  term  unemployment  due  to the  change  in  the  economic\r\n\r\nstructure  where there would be mismatch of skills.  Right  now,\r\n\r\nthere  are  workers who were previously enjoying  good  economic\r\n\r\nreturns in jobs, such as welders, metal fabricators, plasterers,\r\n\r\nbricklayers,  etc.   The metal and construction  industries  are\r\n\r\nalready  facing  strong competition from cheaper foreign  labour\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia, China and India.  Cleaners and odd-job labourers\r\n\r\nare  also  facing the same problem.  Many of these workers  have\r\n\r\nlittle education and are in their middle\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nage, with families to support.  Most of them are from the middle\r\n\r\nlower  or  lower  income groups.  If they  are  unable  to  move\r\n\r\nupwards  in  tandem  with  the  economy  and  eventually  become\r\n\r\nunemployed,  we  would see this segment of the society  becoming\r\n\r\nadversely affected, and this would hurt the cohesiveness of  our\r\n\r\nsociety in the long run.  Although they know they are now facing\r\n\r\nstrong  competition and may even lose their jobs in the  future,\r\n\r\nthey do not know what other jobs they can switch to and what are\r\n\r\nthe avenues open to them to acquire the necessary new skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has announced various schemes in the\r\n\r\nretraining  of workers. The schemes seem to favour workers  with\r\n\r\nat  least secondary education.  For example, the Report  of  the\r\n\r\nSkills  Development Fund for 1997/98 shows  that  in  1997  $5.5\r\n\r\nmillion of grants were committed to the training of workers with\r\n\r\nPSLE  qualifications or below, whereas a total  of  $54  million\r\n\r\nwere  committed to train workers with secondary or GCE \"O\" level\r\n\r\nqualifications.  In terms of training places, 54,180 places were\r\n\r\ncommitted for those with PSLE qualifications and below  compared\r\n\r\nto  286,434  places for higher educated workers.   Even  workers\r\n\r\nwith  university degrees were given higher allocation of  grants\r\n\r\nand  more  training places than workers with PSLE qualifications\r\n\r\nor  below.   I  urge the Government to refocus its  priority  in\r\n\r\nworkers'  training to ensure that those who are older  and  have\r\n\r\nlittle  education  remain employable  in  the  future.   Greater\r\n\r\nefforts must be made to reach out to these workers to offer them\r\n\r\ntraining  and  an  alternative career in  their  job  before  it\r\n\r\nbecomes too late when they will face long term unemployment  and\r\n\r\nhence financial hardship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no good just pleading with employers to give them a\r\n\r\nchance,  as  what  the  Prime Minister did,  not  so  long  ago.\r\n\r\nAlthough  these  workers may not know what is a  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy  and may not be able to operate sophisticated  machines,\r\n\r\nthey  are part of our society and are prepared to do tough  jobs\r\n\r\nthat many others shun.  The Government should help them to avoid\r\n\r\nfinancial hardship due to economic restructuring.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to point out another weakness in the\r\n\r\ntraining  programmes being offered, ie, the programmes rely  too\r\n\r\nmuch  on  employers  to decide whether they  should  send  their\r\n\r\nworkers  for training.  For example, the Back-to-Work programme,\r\n\r\ndepends  on  whether the workers are selected by  the  potential\r\n\r\nemployers  for training, and the Skills Redevelopment  Programme\r\n\r\ndepends  on  the employers to send their existing workforce  for\r\n\r\nupgrading.   Many workers also see the BEST and WISE  programmes\r\n\r\nwill lead them to nowhere or too far to somewhere, as these  are\r\n\r\nnot  specific skills redevelopment programmes that will  enhance\r\n\r\ntheir skills to become more employable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest the Ministry of Manpower make a projection of the\r\n\r\nmanpower needs of the various job sectors and provide grants and\r\n\r\noffer  training places to workers who are currently  working  in\r\n\r\nthose  less  promising industries who wish to change their  jobs\r\n\r\nand to build a new career.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the Government should realise that\r\n\r\nthere  are  workers  who  are working  in  some  less  promising\r\n\r\nindustries, who are older and it is too late for them to  obtain\r\n\r\na  basic  general education.  They face the prospect  of  losing\r\n\r\ntheir   job.   They  need  retraining  badly  so  as  to  remain\r\n\r\nemployable in the future.  The Government should also note  that\r\n\r\nthese  workers  may not be working in multi-national  companies.\r\n\r\nThey  are  also not unionised.  I urge the Government to  target\r\n\r\nthis  specific group of workers and design programmes  that  are\r\n\r\ntailor-made to their needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, I am pleased to note that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Manpower has already come up with the key  features\r\n\r\nof the national life-long learning system in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than half a million workers who are above 35\r\n\r\nyears  or  so, who have low educational qualifications  and  low\r\n\r\nlevel of skills, a comprehensive training system is much needed.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  has  said  that  incentives  would  be  given  to\r\n\r\nemployers and individual workers so that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nskills  training can be provided and taken up by  the  employers\r\n\r\nand  workers  respectively.  Currently, workers whose  companies\r\n\r\nhave  signed  up  under the Skills Redevelopment Programme  have\r\n\r\nbetter  chances  for training for higher skills  than  those  in\r\n\r\ncompanies  which  have not signed up.  Union  members  can  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of the NTUC's Education and Training Fund, but workers\r\n\r\nin  the non-unionised sectors would have less opportunities  for\r\n\r\nskills training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed national life-long training system must take\r\n\r\ninto  consideration the needs of this group of  workers.

They\r\n\r\nshould  be sufficiently enticed to take up courses so that  they\r\n\r\ncan improve themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the coin, Sir, are companies which may\r\n\r\nbe  reluctant  to send their workers for higher skills  training\r\n\r\nother  than  those  provided by the companies themselves.   Such\r\n\r\ncompanies  may  fear that their workers may job hop  after  they\r\n\r\nhave  got  better  training and better skills.    How  will  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  encourage  such companies to send  their  workers  for\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading?  Sir, the task to help our workers to transit\r\n\r\nto  a knowledge-based economy is a huge one.  I do not think  it\r\n\r\ncan  be  done  by just the Government.  It must  be  a  national\r\n\r\neffort which involves all sectors in our economy.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the Minister for Manpower about the role that would  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  trade union movement, Chambers of  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  and  self-help organisations so that our  workers  who\r\n\r\nneed training to transit into a knowledge-based economy can  get\r\n\r\nall  the training facilities and opportunities they can  get  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nduring  the  budget  debates last year, I spoke  in  support  of\r\n\r\nNTUC's  proposal to increase the amount allocated to the  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme (SRP)  so that some 700,000 people  with\r\n\r\neducation below the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsecondary  level can upgrade their skills to catch up  with  the\r\n\r\neconomic development of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, in the past 12 months, tens of thousands\r\n\r\nof  people  have  signed up for the SRP.  The response  is  very\r\n\r\npositive  and  very encouraging.  However, during this  economic\r\n\r\nrecession,  in  order  to cut cost to improve   competitiveness,\r\n\r\nsome  companies have retrenched their unskilled or  semi-skilled\r\n\r\nlocal  workers and replaced them with foreign workers.  Many  of\r\n\r\nthese workers were recruited during the boom time but some  were\r\n\r\njust recruited quite recently.  As our population is small,   we\r\n\r\nlack  human  resources  and  foreign  workers  are  imported  to\r\n\r\nsupplement  our local recruits.  When we were having  7%  to  8%\r\n\r\nannual  economic growth in Singapore, import of foreign  workers\r\n\r\nwas acceptable.  But during a recession like the present one, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  adjust this policy to prevent our local  workers  from\r\n\r\nbeing squeezed out.  Foreign workers are willing to accept lower\r\n\r\npay,   some  as low as 50% of what our local workers  are  paid.\r\n\r\nHow  could they survive?  It is simple.  Their families are  not\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  Their families are living in countries where the\r\n\r\nstandard  of living is much lower than ours.  Unlike  our  local\r\n\r\nworkers  who  have to pay for their  flats, taxes, medical  fees\r\n\r\nand  children's  education, look after their families  and  even\r\n\r\ntheir  aged  parents and in-laws, these foreign workers  do  not\r\n\r\nhave much financial commitments over here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our workers have the aspiration that one day they\r\n\r\nwill  reach  the Swiss standard of living.  Not all  Singaporean\r\n\r\nworkers  can  be retrained at the same time, but the  market  is\r\n\r\nrelentless.   Whoever  is prepared to accept  the  cheapest  pay\r\n\r\ngets  the job.  So if our foreign workers policy is not adjusted\r\n\r\nimmediately, then the local workers who are trained will  become\r\n\r\nunemployed  after training. As some people have remarked,  these\r\n\r\npeople will be trained to become unemployed.  Even those who are\r\n\r\ntrained  and retrained, their jobs are not completely secure  in\r\n\r\nthe  face  of challenges by the foreign workers.  They face  the\r\n\r\ndanger of a declining standard of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 20 years, our economy has prospered, and we\r\n\r\nhave been going for the high wage policy. That is to improve the\r\n\r\nincome  of  our people.  At the same time, it has also increased\r\n\r\nthe cost of doing business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the Government and the private sector have\r\n\r\nbeen  spending  a lot of money on the training of these  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.   After  working  for two or three  years,  and  having\r\n\r\naccumulated  enough savings, they would pack up  and  return  to\r\n\r\ntheir hometown, and their skills will also go home with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lucky ones, who are given permanent residence here,\r\n\r\nare  not only asking for equal pay as our citizens, but are also\r\n\r\nstarting  to  job-hop.   In this way, we  do  not  have  a  core\r\n\r\nworkforce.   I  hope the Minister can issue some  guidelines  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  can understand in what circumstances our local workers\r\n\r\ncan compete with the foreign talents.  I agree with the views of\r\n\r\nMr  Low Thia Khiang and some other MPs that without having clear\r\n\r\nguidelines  on  how  our workers can compete  with  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers,   we  will be going backwards.  It will be against  our\r\n\r\nnational interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nas  we  all know, the only way for Singapore to survive  in  the\r\n\r\n21st  century  is  to  build  up a world  class  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.   In order to attain this objective, we need  to  build\r\n\r\nour  knowledge-based infrastructure.  To do this, the key is  to\r\n\r\nbuild up a high quality workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese saying, \"It takes 10 years to grow a\r\n\r\ntree  but it takes 100 years to develop a man.\"  If we  want  to\r\n\r\nbuild up a knowledge-based workforce, we have first of all to go\r\n\r\nby  education.   That  is the reason why our Government  leaders\r\n\r\nhave been emphasising again and again the importance of lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning and lifelong education. Therefore, I would suggest that\r\n\r\nthe  Government use actual financial assistance or  liberal  tax\r\n\r\nincentives to encourage workers of all grades, young or old,  to\r\n\r\ntake part in all kinds of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neducational  and  training  courses  for  self-enhancement,   to\r\n\r\nattain the state of lifelong learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Government allows the use of CPF savings\r\n\r\nto  invest  in properties and shares under the Asset Enhancement\r\n\r\nScheme.  Enhancement of human resources is very important,  even\r\n\r\nmore  important  than  asset enhancement. Serious  consideration\r\n\r\nshould  therefore  be  given to some \"human  assets  enhancement\r\n\r\nscheme\" to add value to our human assets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to speak on the\r\n\r\nSkills  Development Fund (SDF).  Under the present scheme,  only\r\n\r\nworkers whose income is below $1,000 and whose educational level\r\n\r\nis  below  `A' level can benefit from the scheme.  This standard\r\n\r\nwas fixed quite sometime ago. Now, our Singapore workers' income\r\n\r\nand  educational level have been raised significantly  over  the\r\n\r\nyears.   The  scheme  should be adjusted accordingly.   I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the income ceiling be raised so that workers  with\r\n\r\nincome  of between $1,000 and $2,000 can also benefit  from  the\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the traditional distinction of workers in terms of\r\n\r\nblue-collar work and white-collar work is already obsolete  now.\r\n\r\nIn  future,  the distinction between brain work and  brawn  work\r\n\r\nwill  be very blurred.  The nature of work in the new knowledge-based  economy  is  such  that one can hardly  tell  whether  it\r\n\r\ninvolves  brain  or  brawn.  Any worker from the  administrative\r\n\r\nstaff  to  the operators at the production line are all valuable\r\n\r\nassets  to the company. They are all part of our precious  human\r\n\r\nresources,  and  they  should be given equal  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nskills upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would suggest that the Ministry of Manpower\r\n\r\nrevise,   amend  and  expand  the  regulations  of  the   Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund, so that junior and middle management staff can\r\n\r\nalso   benefit  from  this  training  scheme  to  enhance  their\r\n\r\nprofessional capability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MOM is a Government agency coordinating labour-management relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhile  looking after the labour side, it must not  overlook  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  side  as  well.   I would  suggest  that  while  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is giving more money to NTUC for skills development,\r\n\r\nthey  should  also  help  to  finance  the  business  community,\r\n\r\nagencies or associations in the conduct of  training courses for\r\n\r\ntheir  staff.   This  will  go a long way  to  enhancing  better\r\n\r\ncooperative   relations  among  labour,   management   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, while I understand that our\r\n\r\neconomy is experiencing a slowdown and jobs are in short supply,\r\n\r\nnonetheless,  I would like to address the issue of  job  hopping\r\n\r\nwhich  I  believe will become a problem for us once  we  recover\r\n\r\nfrom the crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a past report by the Political and Economic Risk\r\n\r\nConsultancy (PERC), Singapore was ranked 10 out of 12  countries\r\n\r\nsurveyed in the category of employee loyalty and job hopping was\r\n\r\ncited as a serious problem for our country.  This was 10 out of 12 Asian countries surveyed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing sub-committee of the Committee on\r\n\r\nSingapore's  Competitiveness recommended the use  of  CPF  as  a\r\n\r\nmeasure of controlling staff turnover.  I, however, do not agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  approach  they  suggested because  it  results  in  a\r\n\r\npermanent  disadvantage  for the  employee.   I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest an alternative approach that does not penalise a  worker\r\n\r\nin  the initial years if he or she remains with the company  for\r\n\r\nat least one year.  The suggestions I have are as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the first one year of employment, the employer\r\n\r\ncontributes  only  half  of  the  prevailing  CPF  rate  to  the\r\n\r\nemployee's account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If the employee stays for at least one year, then the\r\n\r\nemployer  reimburses the employee's CPF account  with  the  full\r\n\r\namount  of the remaining half of the employer's CPF contribution\r\n\r\nnot paid for the past one year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If the employee leaves within the first year of\r\n\r\nemployment,  then  he  or  she  will  not  be  entitled  to  the\r\n\r\nemployer's portion of the CPF retained by the employer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this way, no one loses while the burden on the\r\n\r\nemployer is greatly reduced because the cost of hiring, training\r\n\r\nand  re-hiring can be quite substantial.  The employer  can  use\r\n\r\nthe  retained money to defray the cost involved in the re-hiring\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the difficult environment and the record\r\n\r\nnumber of retrenchments, we are still seeing a disturbing  trend\r\n\r\namong Singaporean workers.  I spoke to a number of the employers\r\n\r\nwho experienced staff turnover of new employees within the first\r\n\r\nsix  months of employment.  Some even leave just one  day  after\r\n\r\nstarting their new job.  This happens even today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my own personal experience, I have seen this to be a\r\n\r\nproblem.   Within the first three months of this  year,  I  have\r\n\r\nseen  a  21.4% staff turnover for reasons like unwillingness  to\r\n\r\nwork  in  clean  room environment, disliking  the  job  and  the\r\n\r\nunwillingness to do shift work.  This is despite they being told\r\n\r\nof  all  of  these during the interview process.   And  this  is\r\n\r\ndespite  the  gloomy employment environment.  Some Members  also\r\n\r\ntalk  about potential employees not accepting job offers.   From\r\n\r\nmy  own experience this year, we actually interviewed a total of\r\n\r\n58 candidates and we looked at the candidates that were referred\r\n\r\nto us by NTUC.  These were people who were retrenched from their\r\n\r\nwork.   Of  the  58  that we interviewed, some  of  course  were\r\n\r\nrejected.  26 of those we offered did not accept the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that this problem of job hopping and\r\n\r\nattitude  of  employees still exist.  In my personal  case,  the\r\n\r\ncompensation  package was designed to match those  of  MNCs,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  even better than MNCs, but workers are still not  willing\r\n\r\nto stay around.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister will seriously consider this\r\n\r\napproach to prevent job hopping.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I draw hon. Members' attention to the\r\n\r\nfact  that  we  are running out of time on this  amendment.   We\r\n\r\nstill have got quite a number of speeches to be heard.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Last year in June, I was\r\n\r\nhere  to express my concern that unemployment could reach 4%  by\r\n\r\nthe end of last year, and 5% to 7% by the end of this year.   At\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the  day,  I was not too far wrong.   Unemployment\r\n\r\nreached 4.3% as at the end of last year and could possibly reach\r\n\r\n5% to 7% this year with rising unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today I am here to express another concern. Many\r\n\r\npeople  feel that our economy is likely to recover by the second\r\n\r\nhalf of this year and with that, unemployment will drop and  all\r\n\r\nthe problems we have with unemployment will disappear.  I do not\r\n\r\nthink  so.  My view is that unemployment is likely to be  sticky\r\n\r\nthis  time round.  In fact, I believe that unemployment rate  is\r\n\r\nnot  likely to drop significantly over the next few years.   Why\r\n\r\nis  it so?  Because I firmly believe that cyclical recovery will\r\n\r\nnot  solve the unemployment problem.  If we were to look at  the\r\n\r\nexperience  of the other more advanced economies -  US,  Europe,\r\n\r\nand  so  on  -  most  of  them went from  unemployment  to  full\r\n\r\nemployment,  from  full  employment to structural  unemployment,\r\n\r\nfrom structural unemployment to jobless growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, I believe that we may face the\r\n\r\nsame problem of jobless growth for the next few years.  Because,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  as  the  Minister has mentioned,  some  employers  are\r\n\r\nadopting  a  wait-and-see attitude, so they are  not  likely  to\r\n\r\nrecruit people over the next few months.  But, more importantly,\r\n\r\nbecause new operations which we are creating in the economy  are\r\n\r\ngoing to require fewer people, and at the same time the pace  of\r\n\r\nrestructuring  is  likely to continue  to  remain  fast.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  we are likely to see a very marginal increase in  terms\r\n\r\nof  net  job creation over the next few years.  So my  worry  is\r\n\r\nthat  if  we  do  end up with a prolonged period  of  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment,  how  would that affect social cohesion,  national\r\n\r\nunity, and so on?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to find a way to prevent jobless growth. We\r\n\r\ncannot  do  so by trying to slow down the pace of restructuring.\r\n\r\nBut we can do so by focusing on structural recovery.  Structural\r\n\r\nrecovery means different things to different economies.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase of Singapore, our structural weakness is a mismatch between\r\n\r\njobs  and  skills of workers.  Therefore, the key to  structural\r\n\r\nrecovery  in  the case of Singapore really is to  focus  on  the\r\n\r\ntraining  and  development of knowledge  workers.   We  need  to\r\n\r\nenlarge the pool.  We need to upgrade the capabilities, so that,\r\n\r\nhopefully,  in  the near future we can get out of  this  jobless\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may argue: are knowledge workers so important? I\r\n\r\nremember,  in  my days at the EDB, in the past,  when  investors\r\n\r\ndecided  on  investment  locations, there  were  four  criteria.\r\n\r\nFirstly, physical infrastructure.  Do we have the facilities  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  operation?  Secondly, cost of operation;  thirdly,\r\n\r\navailability of manpower; and lastly, availability  of  capital.\r\n\r\nToday, it has changed.  The first criterion is manpower.  Do  we\r\n\r\nhave  the knowledge workers to support the operation?  Secondly,\r\n\r\ndo  we  have the knowledge and global infrastructure to  support\r\n\r\nglobalisation of operation?  Thirdly, availability  of  capital,\r\n\r\nbecause  all these operations are capital-intensive; and lastly,\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this situation, I believe that we have done enough in\r\n\r\nthe  areas  of  nurturing a capital market  in  Singapore,  cost\r\n\r\ncutting  through off-Budget measures, and so on.   We  are  also\r\n\r\nworking  very hard on knowledge and global infrastructure,  like\r\n\r\nSingapore  One,  the Boston of the East, the  wafer  fab  parks,\r\n\r\nJurong  Island,  and  so  on.  But in the  areas  of  capability\r\n\r\ndevelopment, I feel that we are still not doing fast enough  and\r\n\r\ngoing  far  enough.   I  hope we will give greater  urgency  and\r\n\r\ngreater  push  on  the  training and  development  of  knowledge\r\n\r\nworkers so that we can speed up the creation of jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question to the Minister is: will the Ministry\r\n\r\nconsider  setting up a $1.2 billion fund known as  the  Manpower\r\n\r\nDevelopment Assistance Scheme?  I have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfaxed my proposal to the Ministry.  I think the Minister has the\r\n\r\ndetails.   I  will circulate it to the media in  case  they  are\r\n\r\ninterested  in  the  contents.  But let  me  just  mention  very\r\n\r\nbriefly that my proposal is, firstly, to use the fund to support\r\n\r\nthe  formulation  of  new curriculum in  all  economic  sectors;\r\n\r\nsecondly,  expand  the training capacity in all  major  sectors;\r\n\r\nthirdly,  upgrade  the  training  capabilities  in  new   growth\r\n\r\nsectors;  fourthly,  extend the scope of support  to  all  major\r\n\r\ncategories of employees and professions; fifthly, focus  SDF  on\r\n\r\nrank-and-file   workers  with  co-funding   support   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and then support skills certification, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, in this proposal I have added two\r\n\r\nideas  that  I  think are important.  In addition to  developing\r\n\r\nknowledge workers among the local workforce, I support the  idea\r\n\r\nthat  we have to continue to attract foreign talents.  I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  the issue is one of toning-up or toning-down this message\r\n\r\non  attracting  foreign talent.  Rather it  is  to  re-tone  our\r\n\r\nmessage,  ie,  let us be more selective, let us go  for  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent who really can make a difference in helping us to upgrade\r\n\r\nthe  capability of our pool of knowledge workers.   As  for  our\r\n\r\nyoung  Singaporeans, I am very concerned that  one  out  of  six\r\n\r\nyoung  graduates last year is still jobless today.  Sir, I think\r\n\r\nit  is  something that we should be concerned about, and I  hope\r\n\r\nthat the MDAS will do something to help the younger workers too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me just say that we are going to go into\r\n\r\na  period  of jobless growth.  I do not know whether I  am  100%\r\n\r\nright  in my assessment, but I am very sure I am not 100% wrong.\r\n\r\nSo please do something.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to speak on improving\r\n\r\nthe culture of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1917, the communists in Russia rose up in revolution\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Czar.  They were successful.  They  overthrew  the\r\n\r\nCzar  and took over power.  Among the first social reforms  they\r\n\r\ncarried out was to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimprove  the  cultural level of the workers.  The  workers  were\r\n\r\ntaught  how  to behave properly.  They were told not  to  behave\r\n\r\nlike  country bumpkins.  When they attended a ballet performance\r\n\r\nat  the  Bolshoi  Theatre, they were  told  not  to  wear  their\r\n\r\novercoats  into the theatre but to leave them outside  with  the\r\n\r\nattendants,  especially when their overcoats were  covered  with\r\n\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalin was the second communist ruler in Russia. He built\r\n\r\nthe  military  might of Russia which defeated  Nazi  Germany  in\r\n\r\nWorld  War II.  Stalin once was asked what he thought  were  the\r\n\r\ntop  three  priorities  for  Russia.   He  said  the  top  three\r\n\r\npriorities were, firstly, military matters; secondly,  cultural;\r\n\r\nand thirdly, economic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite surprising to us in Singapore that Stalin\r\n\r\nshould give more importance to culture than to the economy.   He\r\n\r\nwas  probably of the view that once people became more cultured,\r\n\r\nthey  are  more disciplined, and would make better soldiers  and\r\n\r\nalso would be more responsible and make better citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World War II had shown that both the Russians and the\r\n\r\nGermans  were equally good soldiers.  Both were very disciplined\r\n\r\nand  they  fought bravely, possibly due to their  high  cultural\r\n\r\nlevel.   The  average German soldier in World War II was  highly\r\n\r\ncultured.   He  listened  to  the  music  of  Wagner,  Bach  and\r\n\r\nBeethoven.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore have no educational programmes to raise the\r\n\r\ncultural  level of the workers, except when there  is  a  social\r\n\r\nnecessity  to  do so.  The Government then passes laws  to  curb\r\n\r\nworkers'  bad  habits, like forcing them to  flush  the  toilets\r\n\r\nafter  their  use, or not to spit in public places,  or  not  to\r\n\r\njaywalk.  These penal provisions, although mandatory in  nature,\r\n\r\ndo have an educative effect and they do raise the cultural level\r\n\r\nof  the workers.  Those laws do make people behave more civilly.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore, I think the Government, and perhaps the NTUC, must\r\n\r\nhave  a  lot to do in raising the cultural level of the workers.\r\n\r\nThere  is  still  a lot of work to be done to  get  the  workers\r\n\r\ninterested  in some sports and games or in the theatre  and  the\r\n\r\narts.  It is observed that the average\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworker, other than his work, has no other interests.  He is  not\r\n\r\neven  interested in his own family.  He spends most of his spare\r\n\r\ntime  drinking beer at coffeeshops after his working hours.   He\r\n\r\ngoes  home late, smelling heavily of liquor to the annoyance  of\r\n\r\ncourse  to  his  wife and children.  This type of workers  seems\r\n\r\ncompletely lost.  They have nowhere to go and do not  know  what\r\n\r\nto  do with their leisure hours.  On weekends, they are probably\r\n\r\nfound  in  the  race-course gambling on horses.  The  Government\r\n\r\ncondones  such  a  situation as both liquor and  gambling  bring\r\n\r\nrevenue to the coffers of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the present state of the workers in Singapore\r\n\r\ndoes not augur well for the country.  Something must be done for\r\n\r\nthe  present workers to raise their cultural level.  As for  the\r\n\r\nfuture  workers, our education system needs to  be  revamped  to\r\n\r\nteach   our   children   how  to  occupy  their   leisure   time\r\n\r\nmeaningfully.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I will first address the points\r\n\r\nraised  by  Mr  Charles  Chong  who  is  concerned  with  rising\r\n\r\nunemployment and asked what is our policy on balancing the  need\r\n\r\nto  attract foreign talent and local workers.  In fact,  I  have\r\n\r\nexplained  that earlier on.  The point I want to  make  here  is\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  well  aware of the need to balance  the  flow  of\r\n\r\nforeign workers with the drop in job creation.  That is  why  in\r\n\r\nthe  November 1998 cost reduction package, we have  reduced  the\r\n\r\nforeign  worker levy for the skilled workers, but  we  have  not\r\n\r\nchanged the dependency ratio.  There is still a dependency ratio\r\n\r\nwhich  will  govern  how many foreign workers  an  employer  can\r\n\r\nemploy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also not reduced the levy on the unskilled workers,\r\n\r\nparticularly those in the construction sector, because  that  is\r\n\r\nwhere the bulk of the foreign workers come from.  What I want to\r\n\r\nadd  here  is that the mere tightening of the inflow of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers, particularly those in the work permit category, may not\r\n\r\nresult  in more jobs for the local workers.  Because if we  deny\r\n\r\naccess to these work permit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nholders, we may in fact hamper the efforts of many employers who\r\n\r\nare trying to regain competitiveness and their market share.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the lower skills level, many foreign workers are still\r\n\r\nneeded  by  employers, particularly in industries  such  as  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  sector,  where many locals  are  just  simply  not\r\n\r\nprepared to take up these jobs although there are many  jobs  in\r\n\r\nthe  construction sector which are in fact well within the means\r\n\r\nand  capabilities  of Singaporeans.  Even in  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustry, foreign workers are employed because they fill a  need\r\n\r\nwhich Singaporeans in many instances are not willing to take up.\r\n\r\nFor instance, as described by Mr Inderjit Singh a moment ago, he\r\n\r\nhas  experienced  a high turnover rate because Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nnot prepared to do some of this work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are still reluctant to do some of the\r\n\r\ndifficult  jobs in the manufacturing sector or those jobs  which\r\n\r\nrequire  rotating shift work.  And this is where foreign workers\r\n\r\nare still needed to help these companies to remain viable and to\r\n\r\ncompete  successfully.  So we should not be too quick,  at  this\r\n\r\njuncture,  to  deny  companies access to even  the  work  permit\r\n\r\nholders,  unless  we  are sure that the  locals,  including  the\r\n\r\nunemployed  locals,  are ready to take on  these  jobs.   If  we\r\n\r\nprematurely make adjustments or turn off the flow of work permit\r\n\r\nholders  to the employers, we may actually hasten their loss  of\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,  their  inability to regain  market  share  and\r\n\r\nexpedite  their  exit from Singapore.  If that happens,  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  lose  50%  more jobs because, as I  said,  under  the\r\n\r\npresent rules, the manufacturing sector has a maximum dependency\r\n\r\nratio  of 50%.  In fact, by having foreign workers here, we  are\r\n\r\nalso preserving jobs for other Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked what we are doing about re-engineering\r\n\r\nand  revamping some of the jobs at the lower end of  the  skills\r\n\r\nlevel  which,  perhaps, some Singaporeans may have  to  consider\r\n\r\ntaking  up  because they may not have the ability or  the  basic\r\n\r\neducation for further skills upgrading.  I agree with him that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere  is  a group of Singaporeans who lack the basic  education\r\n\r\nfor  them to benefit from any skills upgrading effort.  For this\r\n\r\ngroup,  we  have  to help them to be redeployed to  a  different\r\n\r\nsector.   They still have to be trained. But they can be trained\r\n\r\nto  work  in  a  different sector.  So my Ministry  is  in  fact\r\n\r\nworking  on  specific programmes to see how some  of  the  lower\r\n\r\nskilled  jobs can be re-engineered to be upgraded  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nskill  content  and  professionalism so  that  Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\ncannot  do work in the high-tech industries in the manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector  can now take on these jobs, particularly in the  service\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One industry that we are interested in looking at is the\r\n\r\ncleaning  industry.  Traditionally, this cleaning  industry  had\r\n\r\nbeen  very dependent on foreign workers.  We are in fact working\r\n\r\nwith  the  cleaning  industry to see  how  we  can  enhance  the\r\n\r\nproductivity  of  the cleaning workers.  If we can  enhance  the\r\n\r\nproductivity  of  the cleaning workers, then they  can  be  paid\r\n\r\nmore.   If  they  can be paid more, the jobs  will  become  more\r\n\r\nattractive to Singaporeans who do not have the skills to do  the\r\n\r\nother  manufacturing  sector jobs.   We  are  working  with  the\r\n\r\ncleaning   association,   ie,   the   Environmental   Management\r\n\r\nAssociation of Singapore, and also the PSB's Standards  Division\r\n\r\nto  design a set of cleaning industry quality standards.  We are\r\n\r\nalso  developing  training  programmes  and  certification   for\r\n\r\ncleaning skills.  This is not unusual as one would have thought.\r\n\r\nIn  countries  like  Denmark, they have an established  cleaning\r\n\r\nindustry,  in  fact,  a multinational in the cleaning  industry.\r\n\r\nThey  have  very  clear-cut and objectively  developed  cleaning\r\n\r\nindustry standards which help the industry to reach a very  high\r\n\r\nlevel of professionalism and service quality.  Their workers are\r\n\r\nvery  well-paid and well-rewarded and they are not dependent  on\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  to  do those jobs.  So we  should  aspire  and\r\n\r\nstrive  towards  that  direction  where  an  industry  like  the\r\n\r\ncleaning  industry can be made more attractive for some  of  our\r\n\r\nlower skilled Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, retraining and re-engineering jobs alone will not\r\n\r\nsolve  all  the problems.  Workers must also have more realistic\r\n\r\nexpectations and change their mindsets with regard to wages  and\r\n\r\nthe  nature  of  their jobs, especially during  this  recession.\r\n\r\nRecently,  we  organised a two-day job fair to enhance  workers'\r\n\r\nunderstanding of clean room jobs.  Nine firms with  a  total  of\r\n\r\n500 vacancies came along to participate in the fair.  At the end\r\n\r\nof  the  two-day fair, we succeeded to fill 100-plus  vacancies.\r\n\r\nThis  is already an improvement.  The other recruitment exercise\r\n\r\nthat we had mounted for the clean room sector had an even poorer\r\n\r\nresponse.   The  100-plus  workers  recruited  are  already   an\r\n\r\nimprovement.   But  we have to ask ourselves why  the  employers\r\n\r\nhave  such  difficulty filling vacancies for these  well  paying\r\n\r\njobs.  Why is it so during this period of high unemployment  and\r\n\r\nrecession?  If it is a lack of skills, then our workers must  be\r\n\r\nmore  willing  to  undergo training and  skills  upgrading.   If\r\n\r\nworkers  have unrealistic expectations about what they ought  to\r\n\r\nbe paid for such jobs, then they must be moderated because it is\r\n\r\na  question  of how we can remain competitive.  We are  not  the\r\n\r\nonly  country  with wafer fabrication plant or other  electronic\r\n\r\nindustries operating clean rooms.  Others are doing so  at  much\r\n\r\nlower wages.  We have to be competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng raised quite a number of questions. I will\r\n\r\ntry to deal with them in the order that he has raised them.   He\r\n\r\nasked whether we can provide monthly updates on job creation and\r\n\r\njob  opportunities in the various economic sectors.  My Ministry\r\n\r\nreleases  a  quarterly  Labour  Market  publication  to  provide\r\n\r\nworkers and employers with a comprehensive and up-to-date labour\r\n\r\nmarket  information.   The  quarterly  release  supplements  the\r\n\r\nannual Labour Market Survey and also occasional papers on labour\r\n\r\nmarket  to help job seekers, workers and employers make informed\r\n\r\ndecisions.  Currently, we have already conducted a total  of  15\r\n\r\nregular  surveys a year to gather information from  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  establishments  and households.   In  addition,  ad  hoc\r\n\r\nsurveys are also conducted by the Ministry on various employment\r\n\r\nissues.  We have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreceived  feedback  from the employers that  this  frequency  of\r\n\r\nsurveys  is  already posing a burden on some  of  them.   It  is\r\n\r\nperhaps  not  practical at this juncture to  conduct  a  monthly\r\n\r\nsurvey,  as suggested by Mr Ong, because too frequent  a  survey\r\n\r\nwould just increase the burden on the employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong also asked what is the number of new entrants into\r\n\r\nthe  labour  market who are gainfully employed and what  is  the\r\n\r\nscale  of  under employment in Singapore.  Sir,  the  June  1998\r\n\r\nLabour Force Survey indicated that there were about 53,000 local\r\n\r\nnew  entrants to the workforce.  Of this, 86% of the  local  new\r\n\r\nentrants  were  gainfully  employed.   Among  the  employed  new\r\n\r\nentrants,  93% were working full time and only 7%  were  working\r\n\r\npart-time.  Under employment commonly refers to persons who  are\r\n\r\nin the employment but have to work part-time because they cannot\r\n\r\nfind  a  full-time job.  The findings of the same  Labour  Force\r\n\r\nSurvey revealed that only a small percentage of our workers  are\r\n\r\ninvoluntary part-timers.  In 1998, only 0.4% of the new entrants\r\n\r\nwho were employed were working part-time involuntarily, in other\r\n\r\nwords,  they  cannot find a full-time job.  Among  all  employed\r\n\r\npersons, the proportion of part-timers is only 0.3%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong has also asked how many of the graduates in the\r\n\r\ntertiary  institutions have decided to extend their studies  and\r\n\r\ngo  on  to  higher  studies  in view  of  the  poor  job  market\r\n\r\nsituation.   According  to  a recent employment  survey  by  the\r\n\r\nNational  University of Singapore and the Nanyang  Technological\r\n\r\nUniversity,  83.4% of the students who graduated last  year  had\r\n\r\nfound jobs within the year, ie, by end of December, compared  to\r\n\r\n95% in 1997.  So we saw a 12% drop.  The same survey also showed\r\n\r\nthat  the  number of post-graduate students at NUS went  up  27%\r\n\r\nlast  year and 20% at NTU.  The sharp increase in the intake  of\r\n\r\npost-graduate  students could be attributed  to  this  group  of\r\n\r\nstudents who have decided to continue with their studies instead\r\n\r\nof coming out into a very poor job market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong asked whether this would just defer the unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem.   My answer is no.  When the economy recovers and  when\r\n\r\nthese students have completed their post-graduate studies,  they\r\n\r\nwould  in  fact  be in a better position to make  more  valuable\r\n\r\ncontribution to the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked what is our success rate in trying to\r\n\r\nfind work for the unemployed Singaporeans.  Mr Hawazi Daipi  has\r\n\r\nalso  raised the same point on our effort to find work  for  the\r\n\r\nunemployed  Singaporeans.  Sir, we have expanded the  Employment\r\n\r\nService  Department in my Ministry to cope with  the  increasing\r\n\r\ndemand for job assistance.  The number of registrants more  than\r\n\r\nquadrupled from 5,000 in 1997 to about 20,000 in 1998.   Despite\r\n\r\nthe  higher  demand  and  also  due  to  the  shrinkage  in  job\r\n\r\nopportunities,  the Employment Service Department  was  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide job referrals to about 78% of all job seekers.  A  total\r\n\r\nof 4,200 job offers resulted from these referrals.  However, not\r\n\r\nall job seekers took up the offer.  Eventually, about 1,000,  or\r\n\r\n5%  of the total registrants, were successfully placed.  We have\r\n\r\nalso tried to persuade low skilled retrenched workers to undergo\r\n\r\ntraining through the SRP so that they can take the new jobs that\r\n\r\nare  being  created.  So if you were to ask me  whether  we  are\r\n\r\nsatisfied with the outcome of 5% placement, my answer is no.  We\r\n\r\nwant to do better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we doing? What we are doing is that we have\r\n\r\nincorporated  various  new mechanisms.   We  have  introduced  a\r\n\r\nbroadcast   mechanism  to  provide  information   to   potential\r\n\r\nemployers of the availability of whole groups of workers who are\r\n\r\nabout  to  be retrenched, or have been retrenched,  so  that  an\r\n\r\nemployer who is still looking for more workers can consider  all\r\n\r\nthese whole groups of retrenched workers.\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also set up an employment facilitation team to\r\n\r\nactually go out to establish contacts with companies to find out\r\n\r\nwhat  are  their labour requirements, what are their recruitment\r\n\r\nplans and to persuade them to pass their job vacancies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto us to be incorporated into our job bank, so that we are in  a\r\n\r\nbetter position to offer more referrals to those who come to  us\r\n\r\nfor job placement assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, I mentioned organising a clean room fair. We\r\n\r\nhave worked with Community Development Councils to organise  job\r\n\r\nfairs  where  employers or companies that are  still  recruiting\r\n\r\nworkers  are  persuaded  to come along, and  we  advertise  this\r\n\r\nfunction held at various community facilities and bring the job-seekers and employers together to help them to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nThe  placement  rate  at  some of these fairs  was  much  better\r\n\r\nbecause  they  were  far more focused.  We achieve  much  better\r\n\r\nplacement rate of 18-20% at the job fairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that we are committed to\r\n\r\nassisting  all  unemployed Singaporeans to look for  alternative\r\n\r\nemployment.   We will step up our efforts to find the  jobs  for\r\n\r\nthem.   We will also be looking into improving further our  job-matching service as well as introducing new initiatives to  help\r\n\r\nout-of-job Singaporeans to look for work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that we allow a retrenched\r\n\r\nworker  and  out-of-work  Singaporean to  borrow  from  his  CPF\r\n\r\nSpecial  Account to meet the daily expenses.  I  understand  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties faced by some retrenched workers, but we  must  not\r\n\r\njust  be  over  engrossed  with the  immediate  problem  and  to\r\n\r\noverlook  the long-term impact if we introduce any new measures.\r\n\r\nWe  should avoid solving one problem only to create a  new  one.\r\n\r\nThe CPF savings are primarily meant for old age requirement,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  to  meet basic housing needs and also  medical  needs.\r\n\r\nMany  CPF  members  have, in fact, used  their  CPF  savings  to\r\n\r\npurchase properties, including HDB flats and private residential\r\n\r\nproperties.  The 10 percentage point reduction in employers' CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate to help employers to cut costs and  to  regain\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness has already caused quite a number of CPF members\r\n\r\nto  face  shortfalls  in their monthly mortgage  repayment.   In\r\n\r\norder to help this group, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  in  fact  allowed  them to draw on their  Special  Account\r\n\r\nsavings to make up for the shortfall in CPF contribution.  If we\r\n\r\nnow  also allow retrenched workers to borrow from their  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  to meet their living expenses, it would further  affect\r\n\r\nthe  ability  of  many  Singaporeans to  service  their  housing\r\n\r\nmortgage.   So, the best way to help retrenched workers  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact, to help them seek re-employment expeditiously so that they\r\n\r\ncan  earn  a  regular  income to support  themselves  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.   Faced  with a crunch, retrenched workers  should  be\r\n\r\nprepared to take on any job.  Having a job is better than no job\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained earlier, we will do everything possible\r\n\r\nat  the Employment Service Department to help retrenched workers\r\n\r\nseek  alternative  employment.   For  those  whose  savings  are\r\n\r\nrunning  out and who lack family support, they can turn  to  the\r\n\r\nmany   community  assistance  programmes  administered  by   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Community  Development, the Community  Development\r\n\r\nCouncils,  the  National Council for Social Services,  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  and  the  various voluntary welfare organisations.   The\r\n\r\ncommunity-operated safety nets are there to help those  who  are\r\n\r\nin  serious difficulties.  To ensure families with school  going\r\n\r\nchildren  do  not  suffer from this downturn,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  also  offers  such  families  assistance  for   their\r\n\r\neducational expenses.  These include partial or full  waiver  of\r\n\r\nschool fees, miscellaneous fees, as well as textbook grants  for\r\n\r\nneedy  students.   For students studying in  the  institutes  of\r\n\r\nhigher learning, they could apply for the CCC university or  CCC\r\n\r\npolytechnic bursaries, tuition fee loans and study loans as well\r\n\r\nas bursary and loan schemes administered by the universities and\r\n\r\nthe polytechnics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health also has a Medifund which is\r\n\r\navailable  to  help  those  who have difficulties  paying  their\r\n\r\nmedical  bills incurred at the public hospitals.   The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance has also announced generous and wide-ranging rebates\r\n\r\non  HDB  rentals, service and conservancy charges and  utilities\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, releasing the Special Account savings of a\r\n\r\nretrenched  worker is an option that should be  reserved  for  a\r\n\r\nworse case scenario of a very deep and prolonged recession.   We\r\n\r\nare  only  just  at the start and we should not rush  into  such\r\n\r\ndrastic  measures  immediately.  Otherwise it  will  reduce  our\r\n\r\noptions for reaction if the situation does get worse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen spoke on the transferability and\r\n\r\nportability of skills certification.  I agree with him.  I think\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  very  important aspect of our school  of  life-long\r\n\r\nlearning.  The present skills training and certification  system\r\n\r\nfor   the   workforce   is  based  on  the  National   Technical\r\n\r\nCertification  (NTC) system.  It is a good,  broad-based,  well-established  system that provides the school-going cohorts  with\r\n\r\nall  rounded  technical and vocational education.  However,  the\r\n\r\nskills training of our workforce is more specific and job based.\r\n\r\nHence, I agree with Mr Chay that we also need the modular system\r\n\r\nof  skills  training  when workers and employers  can  pick  the\r\n\r\nskills that are relevant to their operation.  The modular system\r\n\r\nwill  help  our workers to continuously acquire new  skills  and\r\n\r\nkeep  pace  with  the  changing  requirement  to  enhance  their\r\n\r\nemployability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is working together with PSB to develop a\r\n\r\nNational Skills Recognition system which has been recommended by\r\n\r\nthe  Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness.  The system  will\r\n\r\ndefine  skills  standards for job-based  competencies  that  are\r\n\r\ndirectly relevant to industries and nationally recognised.   The\r\n\r\nNational  Skills  Recognition system  will  complement  the  NTC\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad has raised the question of whether\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers  are  covered by  the  Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme   (SRP).   He  noted  that  the  Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme  has  addressed the needs of workers who  need  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading,  but what about those who have lost their  jobs,  the\r\n\r\nretrenched   workers.   At  present,  the  unemployed   or   the\r\n\r\nretrenched workers can seek sponsorship for participation in the\r\n\r\nSkills Redevelopment Programme by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\napproaching the NTUC or self-help groups such as CDAC,  Mendaki,\r\n\r\nAMP   and   Sinda.   These  self-help  groups  have  volunteered\r\n\r\nthemselves as SRP facilitators.  They act as surrogate employers\r\n\r\nfor  unemployed workers.  Unemployed workers who  register  with\r\n\r\nthe  community self-help groups will also receive the same level\r\n\r\nof  funding support as any workers who have been sponsored by an\r\n\r\nemployer.   A retrenched worker who is willing to go for  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  under the SRP will not be worse off than one  who  is\r\n\r\npresently  employed.   In  fact, the self-help  groups  offer  a\r\n\r\ntraining  allowance of up to $500 per month when training  on  a\r\n\r\nfull-time basis, and the full cost of the training will be borne\r\n\r\nby  the  self-help  group  and the SRP.   So,  as  I  said,  the\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers receive the same incentive  as  one  who  is\r\n\r\nstill at work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang was concerned with Singaporean skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  who  may have to face competition with similar  foreign\r\n\r\nskilled workers.  He mentioned welders, plasterers, etc, and  if\r\n\r\nI  understand  him correctly, he asked whether they  are  facing\r\n\r\ncompetition  from foreign workers, particularly  from  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThe  answer  is yes.  There is some competition.   But  are  our\r\n\r\nSingaporeans completely vulnerable?  The answer is  no,  because\r\n\r\nwe  have a foreign worker policy which requires the employer  to\r\n\r\npay  a  certain levy for the work permit holders and the purpose\r\n\r\nof  the  levy is, to a certain extent, to bridge the gap between\r\n\r\nthose  who  come from lower-wage countries and Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nexpect a higher level of wages.  So, there is some protection of\r\n\r\nSingaporean  workers  at that level from unfettered  competition\r\n\r\nfrom foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned that the training opportunities provided\r\n\r\nby  SDF  seem  to  be  skewed, favouring  too  much  those  with\r\n\r\nsecondary  education,  and those with lower  education  are  not\r\n\r\ngetting  their fair share of training.  I think it is not  quite\r\n\r\ncorrect  because what we have done is that we have  embarked  on\r\n\r\nprogrammes which now deliberately focus on the needs of the less\r\n\r\neducated  or lower-skilled workers.  The SRP is an example.   It\r\n\r\nis a $120 million\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  specifically look at the mid-career  workers  who\r\n\r\nhave  lower  than  secondary education and  who  have  very  low\r\n\r\nskills,  and  to equip them with new skills or to upgrade  their\r\n\r\nskills  so that they could take on the new jobs.  We are talking\r\n\r\nabout extending their employability through skills upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also pointed out that the weakness of the current\r\n\r\nprogrammes for skills upgrading for the workers is that too much\r\n\r\nemphasis is placed on the employers and he quoted examples  like\r\n\r\nthe  SRP.  Perhaps, he may not be aware of what I have just said\r\n\r\nin  response  to  Mr Ahmad Magad that, in fact, even  unemployed\r\n\r\nworkers can participate in the SRP, provided they go to the self-help  groups or to NTUC.  And NTUC would even help workers  from\r\n\r\nthe  non-unionised sector.  All workers are covered  under  SRP.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  just for those who are presently employed  or  just\r\n\r\nunionised workers but every worker who wants to upgrade  himself\r\n\r\nand benefit from the opportunities available under the SRP would\r\n\r\nbe  able to do so.  They can go to NTUC or the self-help  groups\r\n\r\nto seek assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned that some of our educational upgrading\r\n\r\nprojects seem to lead to nowhere.  He cited the examples of BEST\r\n\r\nand  WISE.  I think that is also not correct, because  BEST  and\r\n\r\nWISE  are  programmes to improve the basic literacy of  workers,\r\n\r\nie,  language command and basic numeracy, so that they can later\r\n\r\non  undergo further skills upgrading.  Because without the basic\r\n\r\nlanguage  and numeracy command, you cannot further upgrade  your\r\n\r\nskills.   BEST and WISE are just preparatory courses  which  the\r\n\r\nlower  educated workers have to go through to prepare  them  for\r\n\r\nthe skills upgrading that would come later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi also asked whether we must consider the needs of\r\n\r\nthe  non-unionised workers and whether other  employers  may  be\r\n\r\nmore  willing  to  provide higher skills  training,  because  he\r\n\r\nobserves that some of the employers may be reluctant to  provide\r\n\r\nskills training for their higher\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nskilled employees for fear of job hopping, and what is the  role\r\n\r\nof  NTUC in workers' upgrading.  As I explained earlier on, non-unionised  sector workers can also benefit from SRP.  NTUC  will\r\n\r\nalso  serve  the needs of this group and I think initially,  the\r\n\r\nnon-unionised companies were quite reluctant to come forward  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in the SRP, as they thought it was for the unionised\r\n\r\nworkers  only  or  by  participating  in  SRP,  they  would   be\r\n\r\nencouraging  their employees to become unionised.  But  I  think\r\n\r\nthis perception has largely been corrected because more and more\r\n\r\nnon-unionised  companies are willing to  come  forward  to  work\r\n\r\ntogether with NTUC, and to send their workers for training under\r\n\r\nthe  SRP.  In fact, this shows the benefit of having NTUC  as  a\r\n\r\nmajor  promoter  and  supporter of the  SRP  programme.   As  to\r\n\r\nemployers  who  are  reluctant to  train  their  higher  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  or  executives,  I  think it  is  a  very  shortsighted\r\n\r\nemployer  who  does not train his executives  or higher  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers just because of fear of job hopping.  Then he is forever\r\n\r\nlimiting  the  capabilities of his  employees.   He  is  forever\r\n\r\nliving  with a lower level of potential.  So employers  have  to\r\n\r\nopen  up,  and  they have to be more willing to  support  skills\r\n\r\ntraining at all levels of the company's establishment.  That  is\r\n\r\nthe  only way to maximise their human resource potential.   That\r\n\r\nis  the  only way that he can really compete, by giving all  his\r\n\r\nemployees the best training necessary for them to do a good job.\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang spoke on the same point about whether we should\r\n\r\nnot  review the foreign worker policy, so as not to disadvantage\r\n\r\nthe  local  workers and we need to build up  a  corps  of  local\r\n\r\nskilled workers.  Particularly, he mentioned the point that many\r\n\r\nof  the  foreign workers come from countries with  lower  wages.\r\n\r\nThe  answer to that is that we adopted a policy of imposing  the\r\n\r\nforeign worker levy in order to bridge the wage gap, and to make\r\n\r\nit  very  fair for Singaporeans who cannot compete just on  wage\r\n\r\nalone.   That  is  why the foreign workers attract  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworker levy, depending on the skills level.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked how will Singaporeans get the training to compete\r\n\r\nand  to  upgrade  against the inflow of  foreign  workers.   The\r\n\r\nanswer  is what we have been doing all along.   We will  provide\r\n\r\nmore  opportunities  for  skills  training.   SRP  is  just  the\r\n\r\nbeginning.  When we implement the recommendations that are being\r\n\r\nput  forward by the Manpower 21 studies, we will have a national\r\n\r\nframework for a school of lifelong learning.  We should  provide\r\n\r\nall workers with opportunities to upgrade themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan made several points. He asked whether we\r\n\r\ncould  revise  the $1,000 wage limit on the  Skills  Development\r\n\r\nFund.  The answer is yes.  In fact, in principle, this is agreed\r\n\r\nto.  But the question is, when do we do it?  If we do it now, we\r\n\r\nwill  be adding to the cost for the employer, because the Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment  levy  is in fact a tax on the  payroll.   While  we\r\n\r\nagree,  in principle, to do so, we will do it at a time when  it\r\n\r\nwill have least effect on the competitiveness of the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said that the SDF should widen its scope to include\r\n\r\ntraining  for  mid  and  high level  skilled  workers  within  a\r\n\r\ncompany.  The answer is yes.  SDF does support training  courses\r\n\r\nfor  managerial and executive staff.  While the focus up to  now\r\n\r\nhas  been  on upgrading the skills of workers, as they form  the\r\n\r\nmajority   of   the  workforce  and  are  most  susceptible   to\r\n\r\nretrenchment and structural unemployment, SDF is also willing to\r\n\r\nsupport training initiatives for executives and management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the total company training programme, companies are\r\n\r\nencouraged  to take a total approach to training and development\r\n\r\nthat  covers workers, executives and management, and  all  these\r\n\r\nwill  be supported by SDF.  Currently, approximately 20% of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  training places supported by SDF in a year  are  actually\r\n\r\ntaken  up  by  managers  and executives.   I  think  this  is  a\r\n\r\nreasonable proportion for managers and executives who, in  fact,\r\n\r\nform the minority in the workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with his point that managers and even professionals\r\n\r\nshould also constantly upgrade and be kept abreast of new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nknowledge  in order to stay relevant.  While the Government  can\r\n\r\nsupport  to  some extent, particularly for small  companies  and\r\n\r\nbusinesses, employers should also be prepared to bear a  greater\r\n\r\nshare  of  the  responsibility for training and upgrading  their\r\n\r\nmanagers  and  professionals.   Ultimately,  the  business  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  when  the skills of their executives and  managers  are\r\n\r\nupgraded.   Being the main beneficiary, they should also put  in\r\n\r\ntheir  fair  share  of  supporting such training  and  upgrading\r\n\r\nefforts.   Likewise,  managers  and  executives,  being  already\r\n\r\nhighly  educated,  should also bear part of  the  share  in  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility   for   upgrading.   There   is   an   individual\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  upgrading which they  should  also  accept.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I would consider the Nominated Member's suggestion\r\n\r\nfor  Government to work with business and industry groups, apart\r\n\r\nfrom  NTUC,  to form partnerships to promote and support  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading for their members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh spoke on job hopping. He felt that it is\r\n\r\nstill  a  problem  that  we  must address.   I  have,  in  fact,\r\n\r\npreviously  replied  on  another  occasion  that  forfeiting   a\r\n\r\nworker's  CPF  contribution to deter job hopping  would  detract\r\n\r\nfrom the basic CPF objectives of building up savings for old age\r\n\r\nas  soon  as a person starts working.  Let me add that it  would\r\n\r\nnot  be  effective  in curbing job hopping.  Job  hopping  is  a\r\n\r\ncomplex  and multi-faceted problem.  Workers may leave a company\r\n\r\nfor various reasons, some frivolous, but others may be perfectly\r\n\r\nvalid  and beyond the control of the workers themselves.   While\r\n\r\nexcessive  job  hopping  is undesirable,  a  certain  amount  of\r\n\r\nmobility  in  the labour market is normal, and it will  help  to\r\n\r\nensure an optimal distribution of labour through the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, reducing the employer's share of contribution in the\r\n\r\nfirst year or two of service to deter job hopping is unlikely to\r\n\r\nbe effective in curbing job hopping.  It is also tantamount to a\r\n\r\nwage cut for these workers who have to leave their jobs for good\r\n\r\nreason after a year or less.  That could be quite unfair to  the\r\n\r\nworkers.   Employers  should not just  pass  the  blame  of  job\r\n\r\nhopping to the workers.  What\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhappens in the case where a bad employer fails to provide a  new\r\n\r\nemployee  with the necessary training or career development?  Is\r\n\r\nit  wrong  for  the  employee to look for greener  pastures?   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  every  employer also has some  responsibility  to\r\n\r\nforge a bond with his workers and to establish company loyalty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of changing the CPF system to penalise early\r\n\r\nresignations, employers must also devise their own  remuneration\r\n\r\nsystem  to discourage job hopping.  For instance, employers  can\r\n\r\npay  their workers lower starting salary in the first two years,\r\n\r\nand then reward them with a more attractive remuneration package\r\n\r\nsubsequently if they stay beyond, say, the 2-year period.   Such\r\n\r\nloyalty pay rises are well within every employer's means  to  do\r\n\r\nso  now  and do not require a change in our CPF system.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Member could advise employers to exercise their initiative,\r\n\r\nmanage  their  workers with long-term perspective and  not  just\r\n\r\nshift  the blame to the workers or resort to schemes such  as  a\r\n\r\nCPF cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address the point raised by Mr Lim Swee Say. He\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we  should focus on the training and development  of\r\n\r\nknowledge  workers,  and  he suggested establishing  a  Manpower\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Assistance Scheme or Fund to promote this  training\r\n\r\nof  our workers.  I agree with the Member for Tanjong Pagar that\r\n\r\nwe should have as many workers as possible trained and competent\r\n\r\nto support the knowledge-based economy.  As Singapore moves into\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge age, the rapid change of technology today and the\r\n\r\nstructural  shifts from labour and capital intensive  industries\r\n\r\nto  knowledge intensive industries mean that our workforce  must\r\n\r\nbe engaged in continuous learning and upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since last Monday, in fact, many Members have spoken on\r\n\r\nthe  move into a knowledge-based economy.  Some have asked  what\r\n\r\ndoes  all  this  mean.   What is the need to  develop  knowledge\r\n\r\nworkers?  I want to emphasise at this juncture that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhen we talk about a knowledge-based economy, when we talk about\r\n\r\nknowledge  workers,  we  are talking about  all  levels  of  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.    We   are   talking  about  workers,   supervisors,\r\n\r\nexecutives, managers and professionals.  We are not only talking\r\n\r\nabout  the  managers, executives, engineers  and  the  high-tech\r\n\r\npeople,  we  are talking about every single worker in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe are talking about any worker who tries to learn new skills or\r\n\r\npick up new ideas to enable him or her to do the job better, and\r\n\r\nmore productively.  When we talk about knowledge workers, we are\r\n\r\nreferring to people who approach whatever they do with curiosity\r\n\r\nand creativity, always trying to do a better job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members an example which I happen to come\r\n\r\nacross some months ago in the Straits Times.  I read this report\r\n\r\nabout a Chinese chef, Sam Leong, at the Four Seasons Hotel.   Mr\r\n\r\nLeong was the man who created a new dish  -  pork ribs in coffee\r\n\r\nsauce.  It was unusual to offer  pork ribs in coffee sauce,  and\r\n\r\nwho  would  have  thought that pork ribs go  well  with  coffee?\r\n\r\nWell,  Mr  Leong  did  it.  He thought that  it  would  make  an\r\n\r\ninteresting  combination.  He took great pains.  Through   trial\r\n\r\nand  error,  he arrived at a recipe that was properly  balanced,\r\n\r\ntasty  and  attractive.  He went on to create this  dish  at  an\r\n\r\ninternational  culinary competition and won a prize  for  it,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chef Leong is a knowledge worker. He came up with a new\r\n\r\nidea.   He experimented on his own.  He failed.  He tried  again\r\n\r\nand  finally he succeeded in striking a balance and  created  an\r\n\r\naward winning dish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what I am saying is that you do not have to have a PhD.\r\n\r\nYou do not have to have an MBA.  You do not even have to have  a\r\n\r\ndegree  to  be  a  knowledge  worker.   Singapore  needs   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean to make that effort.  We need many more workers like\r\n\r\nMr  Leong who is prepared to make an effort, who comes  up  with\r\n\r\ninnovative  ideas, experiment on his own, and comes out  with  a\r\n\r\nnew  concoction  that  works  better.   And  in  this  case,  an\r\n\r\ninteresting and unusual dish.  As long as each and every one  of\r\n\r\nus makes an effort,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncomes up with innovative ideas that can boost the quality of our\r\n\r\nwork,  the  productivity of whatever we do, then, in fact,  that\r\n\r\nworker is a knowledge worker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim asked whether we would establish a substantial\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  support training and skills development  for  our\r\n\r\nworkers  to  prepare  them for this work in the  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.   I  agree with him that this will be  done.   Because,\r\n\r\npresently,  we  have  quite a number of programmes  targeted  at\r\n\r\nskills upgrading.  The Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP)  is,\r\n\r\nof  course,  very well known.  There is also the Initiatives  in\r\n\r\nNew Technology (INTECH) which is administered by the EDB.  It is\r\n\r\na   $800  million  programme  to  provide  grants  for  manpower\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  leading-edge technology.  The EDB  also  has  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  post young engineers for overseas assignment,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can pick up skills and experience that will  benefit\r\n\r\nthe economy when it turns around.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this financial year, my Ministry has set aside $50\r\n\r\nmillion as provision for new manpower capability projects.  This\r\n\r\nincludes  establishing  a national skills certification  system,\r\n\r\ndeveloping and upgrading Continuous Education and Training (CET)\r\n\r\nproviders, and also the Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  described  earlier  on  to  train  people  from  other\r\n\r\ndisciplines, to prepare them for jobs in the IT industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the process of finalising the Manpower 21 plan.\r\n\r\nA  key  outcome  will be the development of a lifelong  learning\r\n\r\nsystem,  under  the concept of the School of Lifelong  Learning.\r\n\r\nThe  proposal for a Manpower Development Assistance Scheme  will\r\n\r\nbe  considered together with the need to fund the implementation\r\n\r\nof the other Manpower 21 recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam asked about meeting the cultural needs of workers.\r\n\r\nI agree with him that culture is not just for the highly skilled\r\n\r\nor  the well educated.  Culture is for everybody.  We should all\r\n\r\ntake an active interest in culture.  But he seems to present the\r\n\r\nidea that our ordinary workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  bereft of culture.  I think it is wrong.  It is fallacious.\r\n\r\nI  think  Mr Chiam does not mix with the right group of  people.\r\n\r\nHe  only has to come to my community centre  -  I will extend an\r\n\r\ninvitation to Mr Chiam to visit my community centre,  and  I  am\r\n\r\nsure many Backbenchers will also extend an invitation to him   - to  see  the  amount of cultural activities that go  on  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre, and to see and meet the people who  come  and\r\n\r\nparticipate in these activities, whether it is arts and  crafts,\r\n\r\nChinese painting, social dancing, music.  I have children from 1-room  flats  coming to my CC to learn music,  whether  it  is  a\r\n\r\nChinese  instrument or even the piano.  So, what is  he  talking\r\n\r\nabout that workers in Singapore are deprived of participating in\r\n\r\ncultural   pursuits?    Hundreds  of   thousands   of   ordinary\r\n\r\nSingaporeans participate in cultural activities at the community\r\n\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have conveniently forgotten that each year we\r\n\r\nmount  the  Arts  Festival.  The Arts Festival is  available  to\r\n\r\neverybody.  Every Singaporean can come and enjoy the events  and\r\n\r\nactivities during the Arts Festival.  In fact, during  the  Arts\r\n\r\nFestival  there are as many fringe events as there  are  in  the\r\n\r\nmain events where you have to pay to enter. So the fringe events\r\n\r\nthat are held in Suntec City, Westin, Takashimaya, are all free.\r\n\r\nAnybody  can  come  along and watch an interesting  performance,\r\n\r\nwhether it is by a local group or by an international group.  So\r\n\r\nI  do  not  see why he should give us a lecture on the communist\r\n\r\napproach  to promoting culture for the proletariat.  I think  he\r\n\r\nis  out of touch with what is happening in Singapore.  I am very\r\n\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am aware of\r\n\r\nthe  time.  I would be grateful for as detailed a reply, perhaps\r\n\r\nin  written form, as the Minister has given to the other Members\r\n\r\nwho have spoken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My idea is really the fact that when we move to a knowledge-based economy, I think we also require a fundamental\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchange  in the way in which we work, from one whereby the office\r\n\r\nhours   are  fixed  to  one  where  we  have  flexible   working\r\n\r\narrangements.   Precisely because in a knowledge-based  economy,\r\n\r\ncreativity does not merely just come in the office, it can  come\r\n\r\nanywhere.   Also, because of the fact that we do  have  advanced\r\n\r\nmeans  of  communication and IT, we can also work  anywhere  and\r\n\r\nstill  be  in  communication with our office colleagues.   So  I\r\n\r\nwould urge the Government, in particular, to start this move  of\r\n\r\nchanging  to flexible working arrangements.  Some companies have\r\n\r\nalready  done  so and perhaps the Government could further  give\r\n\r\nimpetus  to  this move by allowing flexible working arrangements\r\n\r\nfor those whose work has a high component of creativity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan has\r\n\r\npainted  a scenario of a knowledge-based economy where work  can\r\n\r\nbe   carried   out  or  performed  away  from  the   traditional\r\n\r\ncentralised office and this is indeed facilitated by  high-speed\r\n\r\ncomputer and telecommunications technology.  This transformation\r\n\r\ninvolves moving the work to where people are, rather than people\r\n\r\nto where the work is. However, I must add a word of caution that\r\n\r\nnot every sector of the economy can be operational off-site.  In\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing industry, for example, most of its activities\r\n\r\ncan only be carried out in the factory premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a global trend for companies to adopt new work\r\n\r\nprocesses  to  enhance their competitiveness  and  enable  their\r\n\r\nemployees to perform work outside the office or to take up flexi-time  and  part-time jobs.  My Ministry recognises this  growing\r\n\r\ntrend, which will also change the way we work in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  economy will require a paradigm  shift  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the  employers  and the workers.   Employers  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared to invest in technological infrastructure to support an\r\n\r\nIT-based work place.   They must also invest in the training  of\r\n\r\ntheir workers to prepare them for the change.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Manpower 21 Sub-Committee on the Workplace\r\n\r\nEnvironment is studying how flexible work arrangement  could  be\r\n\r\npromoted.

It was indeed a horrible year  of\r\n\r\nunprecedented upheavels and unmitigated turmoil.  The region has\r\n\r\nnot seen anything like this before in the post-war era.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaders are helpless and hapless. People are at a loss.\r\n\r\nPeople  are angry and frustrated.  Nations are in search of  new\r\n\r\ndestinies.  Almost the whole region is at sea, so to speak, in a\r\n\r\nsea of troubles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategic situation in the region has changed. The\r\n\r\nbalance  of power has shifted.  There are new paradigms  in  the\r\n\r\nstrategic  situation.   How  can  then  a  small  country,  like\r\n\r\nSingapore,  position itself in this sea change, and  be  nimble,\r\n\r\nnot only to survive, but also to succeed and prosper?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister for an analysis of the strategic\r\n\r\nsituation in the region.  What would be the interests, roles and\r\n\r\nimpact  of  big  powers  like the United  States,  the  People's\r\n\r\nRepublic of China, Japan, and the European Community as a whole,\r\n\r\non  our region?  What meaningful roles can Singapore, as a small\r\n\r\ncountry,  play  to  help promote stability  and  growth  in  the\r\n\r\nregion?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, in the ASEAN region, the past year\r\n\r\nhad   been  dominated  by  important  changes  in  the  domestic\r\n\r\npolitical  situation.  Succession issues, reform  movements  and\r\n\r\nchanges  of  governments  in  ASEAN  countries  seemed  to  have\r\n\r\nconspired to bring a situation of political instability to  some\r\n\r\nof  our neighbouring countries.  These issues have worsened  the\r\n\r\neconomic problems that these countries are already facing  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of the recession.  Governments which already have  their\r\n\r\nhands  full dealing with the fragile economies now have also  to\r\n\r\ncarefully manage domestic political problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushed, so to speak, to a corner by the turn of events,\r\n\r\nsome  of  these  governments have responded by falling  back  on\r\n\r\ndomestic  issues as their number one priority.  Foreign  affairs\r\n\r\nnow appear to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  taken a back seat.  In cases where foreign affairs matters\r\n\r\nwere raised, these have been used to advance domestic agendas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The downgrading of the foreign policy agenda by certain\r\n\r\nASEAN  governments  may  lead to questions  over  the  state  of\r\n\r\nregional   security.   For  instance,  the  collective   defence\r\n\r\narrangement,   the   Five-Power  Defence   Arrangements   (FPDA)\r\n\r\nexercise,  had  to be postponed last year.  The  Spratlys  issue\r\n\r\nremains  unresolved and a potential flash  point.   On  a  wider\r\n\r\nplane,  regional  instability can arise  over  China's  negative\r\n\r\nreactions  to  the US-Japan cooperation on the  Theatre  Missile\r\n\r\nDefence system.  An ASEAN less focused on external security  and\r\n\r\nfragmented by bilateral squabbles would not be able  to  give  a\r\n\r\nfirm  collective  response to security challenges.   This  could\r\n\r\nlead to a lowering of stability and security in our region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this backdrop, I would like to ask the Minister for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs  what  the Government  views  as  the  regional\r\n\r\nsecurity challenges in the next few years, and what steps  would\r\n\r\nbe taken to secure Singapore's interests in this context.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, very often, regional stability is contributed by a\r\n\r\ngood  network of bilateral relations.  Singapore wishes to have,\r\n\r\nand must maintain, good relations with its neighbours.  Of late,\r\n\r\nor  rather  from time to time, these relations are put  to  test\r\n\r\nwhen we face bilateral hiccups, for example, with Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  We have been called names and accused of insincerity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia, in particular, has called on us not to be just a\r\n\r\n\"fair-weather  friend\".   This  remark  has  arisen   over   its\r\n\r\nperception that our offer of bilateral trade financing and other\r\n\r\neconomic  assistance had not been forthcoming.  We must maintain\r\n\r\na   bilateral   relation  that  is  based  on  mutual   respect,\r\n\r\nirrespective of size, and mutual support.  However, even  if  we\r\n\r\nsee  strains in our relations, we should always maintain an open\r\n\r\ncommunication  channel.  Could the Minister tell  us  about  the\r\n\r\nprogress in our relations with Indonesia, including the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncurrent  status  of our offer of the bilateral  trade  financing\r\n\r\nscheme?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to relations with Malaysia, what is the\r\n\r\nprospect  of  us  settling bilateral issues in  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nmanner?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (In Mandarin) :</b> Sir, some years ago,\r\n\r\nwhen  I  visited Washington DC, I was staying at  a  hotel  near\r\n\r\nChinatown.   It  was  about  two  or  three  streets  away  from\r\n\r\nChinatown.   I was warned by the Hotel's front desk receptionist\r\n\r\nnot  to walk around in this capital city by myself as it was not\r\n\r\nquite  safe  to  do so.  Even if I were to go to  Chinatown,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  dangerous.  So I heeded his advice and  took  a  taxi\r\n\r\ninstead.   While  I was in the taxi, I struck up a  conversation\r\n\r\nwith  the taxi driver.  When he heard that I was from Singapore,\r\n\r\nhe  immediately  praised the Singapore Government  for  imposing\r\n\r\ncaning  on an American youth for vandalism.  He felt that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  similar laws in the United States to keep the  crime\r\n\r\nrate down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, when I went to New York, I visited a friend\r\n\r\nwho  was  working at the UN.  There, my American friend and  his\r\n\r\ncolleagues  held the same view as that of the taxi  driver,  ie,\r\n\r\nthey  felt that the Government has many good policies.  But when\r\n\r\nthe   international  media reported the matter,  they  described\r\n\r\nSingapore as being run by a dictatorial government which had  no\r\n\r\nrespect  for human rights and which was in the habit of imposing\r\n\r\nheavy  penalties at random.  Eventually they had to trouble  the\r\n\r\nAmerican President to plea for a reduction in the penalty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On other occasions, I have also come across businessmen,\r\n\r\njournalists, and friends from other countries who told  me  that\r\n\r\nlife  in  Singapore was not as restricted as  reflected  in  the\r\n\r\nnegative reports of the media in their countries.  They remarked\r\n\r\nthat  in  Singapore, whenever they needed any  information  they\r\n\r\ncould get it almost instantaneously, and one could walk out into\r\n\r\nthe streets at night safely without fear of being mobbed, unlike\r\n\r\nin other major\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncities in the world where you go out at your own risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I feel that there is room for improvement in the\r\n\r\nway  Singapore handles its international public relations  work.\r\n\r\nWhenever the international media criticise our policies, we  can\r\n\r\nrequest  our friendly foreign media to carry some honest reports\r\n\r\non  the  truth  of  the matter.  Back home, of  course,  we  can\r\n\r\npublish  articles  to clarify the matter, but  we  should  avoid\r\n\r\nblowing  our own trumpet.  Let other people say the good  things\r\n\r\nabout us.  The effect will be better, and it can hit the nail on\r\n\r\nits  head. For example, we can interview the taxi driver I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier, or these people working in UN, and report  on\r\n\r\ntheir views.  Publicity wise, this can  be more convincing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our missions overseas should do some public relations work\r\n\r\nfrom time to time.  As a matter of fact, this is part and parcel\r\n\r\nof   their  job.  However,  we  must  step  up  our  efforts  in\r\n\r\ncultivating  relationship with the foreign  media,  particularly\r\n\r\nthe  influential ones.  It is said that personal  contact  gives\r\n\r\nyou  a  headstart in building up relationship.  We  should  make\r\n\r\nevery  effort to get to know them better.  We may want to engage\r\n\r\nPR consultants to teach us how to improve our image, or to place\r\n\r\nsome advertisements on these media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this high-tech era, billions of people surf the Internet\r\n\r\nevery  day.  We can post more information and statistics on  the\r\n\r\nNet  in  some  interesting format for people from all  over  the\r\n\r\nworld to access.  For example, we can show our crime rate vis-a-vis  that of other major cities in the world.  We can also  give\r\n\r\nsome  information on the ratio of prison inmates  to  our  total\r\n\r\npopulation  as  compared to other countries, the  percentage  of\r\n\r\ncitizens owning their own homes, and in our schools what is  the\r\n\r\nratio  between  students  and computers,  etc.   We  could  also\r\n\r\nemphasise the significant deterrent effects of death penalty  on\r\n\r\ndrug trafficking, and that more and more countries are beginning\r\n\r\nto  emulate  us  in this aspect.  We can put all  these  on  the\r\n\r\nInternet.   So  anyone who is educated and  who  is  intelligent\r\n\r\nenough will be able to form his or her own\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\njudgement  on whether Singapore's way of governing is the  right\r\n\r\nway,  and  whether there is any infringement of human rights  in\r\n\r\nany of our policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not mean to say that the international\r\n\r\nperception  of Singapore is poor.  However, Singapore  is  after\r\n\r\nall,  a tiny little nation. People from time to time would  like\r\n\r\nto find fault with us,  particularly when the media have to play\r\n\r\nup  some news to win readership and make more money.  So long as\r\n\r\nwe  do not sing praises of ourselves every day, resulting in our\r\n\r\nhaving  to  defend ourselves vigorously at critical moments  and\r\n\r\ncause  people from all quarters to lose confidence in us,  there\r\n\r\nis  no  harm  in  doing some public relations  work  to  further\r\n\r\nimprove our image internationally.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore and Malaysia are close\r\n\r\nneighbours,  with  a long history of relationship,  having  been\r\n\r\nsubject  to the same British colonial rule.

If you recall,  Sir,  our  Government\r\n\r\nmoved  our  CIQ facility to Woodlands last year.   The  move  to\r\n\r\nWoodlands  has created an anomaly for the Malaysian  authorities\r\n\r\nas  the  Malaysian officers at the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station\r\n\r\nwould  be operating as a result of our move to Woodlands without\r\n\r\nthe  presence  of  Singapore officers to lend  it  authority  or\r\n\r\npower, including the powers of arrest, search and seizure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we wanted the Malaysians to co-locate with us, the\r\n\r\nMalaysian authorities decided to remain at Tanjong Pagar Railway\r\n\r\nStation  and  had claimed a legal right to do so.   In  view  of\r\n\r\ntheir  claim, we have asked the Malaysian authorities to  submit\r\n\r\ntheir legal arguments to support their position.  Deadlines were\r\n\r\nagreed upon.  However, the Malaysian government was not able  to\r\n\r\nkeep to the deadline and had repeatedly requested for extensions\r\n\r\nof  time  to  which  Singapore responded positively.   The  last\r\n\r\ndeadline  was  in  February  this  year  wherein  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\ngovernment gave a reply to the Singapore Government and from the\r\n\r\nreports  in the papers, our Government seems satisfied with  the\r\n\r\nreply given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we note that Dr Mahathir on 18th December 1998 had\r\n\r\nindicated that he wanted to resolve all outstanding issues  with\r\n\r\nSingapore in a package deal.  These deals include not  only  the\r\n\r\nCIQ facility at Tanjong Pagar Railway Station but also the other\r\n\r\nissues, which include the withdrawal of CPF funds by Malaysians,\r\n\r\nthe  use of airspace and of course our water supply.  As far  as\r\n\r\nthe  CIQ  issue is concerned, we were at a point where  we  were\r\n\r\nawaiting the Malaysian government to revert with legal arguments\r\n\r\nto  back  their claim of a right to remain at the Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nRailway Station.  So when the Malaysian Foreign Ministry gave  a\r\n\r\nreply  and  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced  that  the\r\n\r\nreply  has met with their concern and are now prepared  to  move\r\n\r\nforward  and  negotiate  with  the  Malaysian  government  on  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive package to deal with all outstanding  issues,  our\r\n\r\npeople were naturally curious about the nature of the reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like my colleagues before me, could the Minister\r\n\r\nplease elaborate in what way has the reply met with our concerns\r\n\r\non the sovereignty and other legal issues?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam is not here.

I  think  Singaporeans  will  be  very\r\n\r\ninterested  to find out the pros and cons of a bridge  over  the\r\n\r\nCauseway.  In other words, conceptually, would the bridge  serve\r\n\r\nSingapore's interest better?  One positive effect in my mind  is\r\n\r\nthat  pollutants in the Straits of Johor could be  flushed  away\r\n\r\nand  the Singapore shore front facing the Straits of Johor  will\r\n\r\nbecome  a  more desirable place to live.  So this  is  only  one\r\n\r\naspect  of  the issues.  Perhaps, the Minister could give  us  a\r\n\r\nmore detailed evaluation of this proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, Malaysia is our closest neighbour,\r\n\r\nboth  geographically and historically.  We were part of the same\r\n\r\nfamily  but because of differences, we parted company.   We  are\r\n\r\nnow both independent and sovereign.  I was a little puzzled last\r\n\r\nyear  when  I  was  in  Malaysia.   One  leader  suggested  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  should treat Malaysia as a big brother.  I  think  in\r\n\r\nany  international relationship, it is very important to get our\r\n\r\nbearings correct.  As a Malay saying goes sak sama, we  must  be\r\n\r\nat the same level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an independent sovereign country. We have our\r\n\r\nown  policies.  They have their own policies.  We do not believe\r\n\r\nin   interfering  with  their  relationship.   They  should  not\r\n\r\ninterfere with our relationship.  It is in the interest of  both\r\n\r\ncountries  to cooperate with each other.  Singapore  has  always\r\n\r\noffered  its hand of friendship to Malaysia.  I believe that  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  score  points  through either  media  or  political\r\n\r\norganisation.   Let  us not debate openly our  differences.   We\r\n\r\nshould  talk  to  each  other  regularly.   Our  Ministers  meet\r\n\r\nregularly.  A pet topic of Mr Chiam See Tong, who is  not  here,\r\n\r\nhas been an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic  union.  In his absence, may I say that I am in  favour\r\n\r\nof  close economic cooperation although I do not know whether it\r\n\r\nis feasible for us to have an economic union now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify what is the\r\n\r\nposition about the water situation.  Where are we now?  On  CIQ,\r\n\r\nother  Members have spoken and the House is interested  to  know\r\n\r\nwhere  we have reached the negotiation at this stage.  I believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  question  of CIQ should not be  delayed  unduly.   We\r\n\r\nshould come to terms with our differences, and I would urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  impress  upon his Malaysian  counterpart  that  we\r\n\r\nshould have a fruitful conclusion as early as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nSingapore-Malaysia relations have always been described  as  one\r\n\r\nof  \"close  neighbours\" but I think sometimes this  may  not  be\r\n\r\nappropriate  because even if you have irreconcilable differences\r\n\r\nwith  your close neighbours, you can always sell your house  and\r\n\r\nmove  elsewhere.  Some have described our relations  as  husband\r\n\r\nand wife, but here, again, you can always get a divorce, move on\r\n\r\nand lead separate lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our relationship with Malaysia goes beyond that. We cannot\r\n\r\nchange the geography of our region.  We will always be together,\r\n\r\nbound  by  common history and an interdependent economy,  strong\r\n\r\nsocial  and  family  ties.  Yet, political relationship  remains\r\n\r\nstressful  and continues to be so.  It has been very  unsettling\r\n\r\nto  many  Singaporeans to observe how quickly and easily  issues\r\n\r\nlike CIQ can be linked to unrelated political points, especially\r\n\r\non the sale of water by Malaysia to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of linking different issues when conducting\r\n\r\nbilateral issues is well known for dragging out disputes.  ASEAN\r\n\r\nhas  always stood for non-linkage.  Malaysia has frequently told\r\n\r\nthe  West  not  to  link  rights  with  environment,  trade   or\r\n\r\ninvestments.  Thus when Singapore expects water or land or other\r\n\r\nissues not to be dragged to discussions on CIQ, it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  out  of  some unique Singaporean tendency but  based  on  a\r\n\r\nprinciple that Malaysia too recognises very well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this principle of non-linkage should extend\r\n\r\nto players as well as to issues; the present dispute between the\r\n\r\ntwo  governments is no reason why the rest of the society should\r\n\r\nturn  unfriendly towards each other.  This, after all, is  very,\r\n\r\nvery far from the state of war.  On the scale of bilateral ties,\r\n\r\nit is but a disagreement over a small number of complex issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ties between Singapore and Malaysia have always been, and\r\n\r\nwill  always  consist  of  more than  just  political  relations\r\n\r\nbetween two governments.  Inter-governmental relations are  just\r\n\r\none  of  the many deep and abiding links between the peoples  of\r\n\r\nour  countries.  Those links extend from the realm  of  business\r\n\r\nand  economics to the private and domestic with families  having\r\n\r\nmembers on both sides of the border.  Culturally, no country  is\r\n\r\nmore similar to Singapore than Malaysia is and the commonalities\r\n\r\nof  language,  food, values and lifestyles continue  to  persist\r\n\r\neven  after  three decades of separate development.  Today,  the\r\n\r\ntwo  countries' identities are distinct enough for their peoples\r\n\r\nto feel a strong sense of nationhood but also similar enough for\r\n\r\nthere  to  be a high level of comfort in day-to-day,  people-to-people relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that civic groups and non-governmental\r\n\r\norganisations on either side of the border have a  special  role\r\n\r\nto  play  in  re-emphasising the broader  nature  of  Singapore-Malaysia  relations.  It is only when both people  have  a  deep\r\n\r\nawareness  of the values of their close relationship  that  both\r\n\r\nsides  will  have  the  necessary commitment  to  resolve  their\r\n\r\ndisputes calmly and rationally, with due consideration given  to\r\n\r\neach other's feelings.  Once those disputes are settled, it will\r\n\r\nagain  be  this  broader relationship that helps both  countries\r\n\r\nachieve our hopes and dreams together.  This would mean the need\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans  to  be  mindful  of  Malaysia's  feelings  in\r\n\r\nnegotiations.   Similarly, it is naturally for  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nexpect their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nown feelings to be weighed when Malaysia chooses their words and\r\n\r\nactions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans should be well aware of the vibrant political\r\n\r\nclimate in Malaysia where political rhetoric is part and  parcel\r\n\r\nof political life.  This understanding helps Singaporeans to put\r\n\r\ncomments  in  their place and not to over-react  to  them  in  a\r\n\r\nparanoid manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singapore cannot be totally immune to such\r\n\r\nprovocation.  Even if rhetoric is mainly for domestic  Malaysian\r\n\r\nconsumption, the speakers must know that their words  are  heard\r\n\r\nin Singapore, as much as ours will be heard in Malaysia and must\r\n\r\nknow  how  critical a resource, water, for example, is  for  our\r\n\r\nsurvival, and ensure that statements on the sale of water do not\r\n\r\ncause any insensitive or unfriendly attitude.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was noticeable during the negotiations on CIQ that the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government,  perhaps  tired  of  the  ever   changing\r\n\r\nposition,  hardened its stand on the issue which leads  to  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to say that we should have been more flexible  and\r\n\r\nless rigid and less legalistic in our negotiations and that  the\r\n\r\ncomplex  issues  could be resolved if younger political  leaders\r\n\r\nhad good relations with their Malaysian political leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that our style of government is\r\n\r\nessentially  different.  It may be the cause of  some  political\r\n\r\nproblems  but  it  is far better to be consistent  and  let  the\r\n\r\nMalaysians understand that we have a style, system and political\r\n\r\nculture of our own, certainly different and sometimes perhaps at\r\n\r\nodds with the Malaysians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic issues in Malaysia will continue to be a major\r\n\r\nfactor  in  our  bilateral relations.   While  good  and  strong\r\n\r\npolitical  relationship  is useful, I sometimes  doubt  if  this\r\n\r\ncould alter the course of the complex bilateral issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must still continue to pursue and develop strong\r\n\r\nrelations at all levels and this is why I call on the Government\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nre-establish sports, cultural, social and civic ties  that  were\r\n\r\nfrozen  earlier.  Prior to that, these ties have for  very  long\r\n\r\nbeen  very  much a feature of our relationship and has  provided\r\n\r\nfor  deeper,  meaningful, lasting and more  stable  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  these  two friendly countries that  we  so  aspire  and\r\n\r\ndeserve.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chong is not speaking. Dr Ong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore's relationship with\r\n\r\nIndonesia  has  undergone many changes since  President  Suharto\r\n\r\nstepped  down from office.  We want to be a friend of Indonesia.\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Indonesia  can  work  together  in  a   mutually\r\n\r\nbeneficial relationship, in a win-win situation in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, over the last few months, we have heard\r\n\r\naccusations,  one  kind or the other, hurled at  us  by  various\r\n\r\nIndonesian  leaders and officials, including President  Habibie,\r\n\r\nhis  adviser,  Dr Dewi Fortuna Anwar, and Cooperatives  Minister\r\n\r\nAdi  Sasono.  These accusations have ranged from Singapore being\r\n\r\n\"too  business-minded\", according to Mr Adi Sasono, to  being  a\r\n\r\n\"fair  weather friend\", according to Dr Dewi Fortuna  Anwar,  to\r\n\r\nbeing \"racist\", as alleged by President Habibie.  What does  the\r\n\r\nMinister have to say about the state of bilateral relations  and\r\n\r\nhow  does  he see the future development of bilateral  relations\r\n\r\nbetween   the  two  countries  in  the  context  of  all   these\r\n\r\naccusations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to comment on the role that the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Foreign Affairs played in assisting the departure  of  large\r\n\r\nnumbers of Singaporeans from Indonesia during the height of  the\r\n\r\nMay  riots in Indonesia last year.  We had then read on a  daily\r\n\r\nbasis  about  the  deteriorating situation in various  parts  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and how our MFA officials helped various Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto get out in time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must commend and thank the MFA officials and diplomats\r\n\r\nfor  extending  such timely and much appreciated  assistance  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Many Singaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  families  and friends there, I am sure, will  join  us  in\r\n\r\nthanking MFA and the diplomats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our regionalisation efforts to set up a second\r\n\r\nwing, many Singaporeans have no choice but are still working  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   I would therefore like to ask the Minister  whether\r\n\r\nany  steps  or  plans  have been put  in  place  to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nprotection  and safety of our own Singaporeans in  Indonesia  in\r\n\r\nany new unexpected turn of event in the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, we have seen that the economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  has  had its terrible toll on the people in the  region.\r\n\r\nThe  full impact of the crisis is now beginning to show in  some\r\n\r\nplaces  and is expressly more pronounced in countries which  are\r\n\r\nmore severely affected by it.  I believe that Indonesia is worst\r\n\r\nhit  by  the  crisis and the tremendous social  cost  is  biting\r\n\r\ndeeper into the society.  On a regular basis, we hear stories of\r\n\r\nfamilies  in Indonesia having to stop sending their children  to\r\n\r\nschool  because of a lack of money or having to cut down on  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of  food consumption because there is not  enough  to  go\r\n\r\naround.   Sickness is often tolerated than cured because  people\r\n\r\nare  without  the  means to seek medical  treatment  or  to  buy\r\n\r\nmedicine.  As a result of the crisis, many people have  suffered\r\n\r\nand  are  suffering.   The suffering is beginning  to  feed  the\r\n\r\nirrational   sentiments  that  are  often  based  on  primordial\r\n\r\ninstincts of race and religion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, in Singapore, are very concerned for the welfare of our\r\n\r\nIndonesian   friends  and  would  like  to   provide   as   much\r\n\r\nhumanitarian aid as we can to relieve their suffering.   It  was\r\n\r\ntherefore, with great gratitude and relief, that the  Red  Cross\r\n\r\nSociety  in  Singapore and some other civic  organisations  have\r\n\r\ninitiated  humanitarian aid for the needy people  in  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nProviding  the assistance for Indonesian friends at this  moment\r\n\r\nwould  also  send a positive signal that we are more  than  just\r\n\r\r\nfair-weather friends.  Within our resources, we hope  that  such\r\n\r\nefforts will continue to seal the friendship which was forged in\r\n\r\nthe decades after we became independent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to ask the Minister for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs whether the Ministry will consider  encouraging\r\n\r\ninitiating  further  humanitarian aid  to  Indonesians  who  are\r\n\r\nseverely affected by the present crisis in their country.  As  a\r\n\r\ncountry,  we  want to extend our sincere feelings of  friendship\r\n\r\nand  concern and we would like to help offer humanitarian relief\r\n\r\nin  any  way  we can.  We may be a small red dot in the  sea  of\r\n\r\ngreen.  However, we want to be a dot that is a beacon that shows\r\n\r\nthe  way  for  humanitarian  relief for  our  fellow  South-east\r\n\r\nAsians.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, Indonesia is our close neighbour\r\n\r\nwhom  we  have strong historical ties.  Indonesia has  been  our\r\n\r\nimportant  trading  partner and I hope that it  will  still  be.\r\n\r\nWhat has been happening in Indonesia is saddening.  The economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  she  is  going  through, we hope,  will  be  over  soon.\r\n\r\nIndonesia's  founding  father has been a firm  believer  in  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of Pancasila.  Both Singapore and Indonesia are in the\r\n\r\nforefront  of  the non-aligned movement.  Singapore  has  always\r\n\r\nbeen  mindful  of Indonesia's situation, and has  done  whatever\r\n\r\nhelp,  both at the people and Government level, to the  country.\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  conducted her relationship with Indonesia  in  a\r\n\r\nvery  courteous  and  considerate manner.   Singapore  does  not\r\n\r\nbelieve in interfering in other countries' affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is saddening to note recently that some\r\n\r\nIndonesian  leaders have started making reference to  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  what is more sad to see is that a very important fabric  of\r\n\r\nour   Government   structure  is  being  questioned,   ie,   our\r\n\r\nmeritocracy  policies.   I  hope and pray  that  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nleaders will stop making future comments on this because it will\r\n\r\naffect   our  relationship  with  them.   Singapore  has  always\r\n\r\nbelieved  in  meritocracy and it is because of this policy  that\r\n\r\nour civil service and armed forces have been a model for others.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the Minister will convey to his counterpart in  a  very\r\n\r\npolite manner that we should keep each other's relationship at a\r\n\r\nlevel  as is required in an international  relationship and  not\r\n\r\nto  interfere with each other's affairs.  Finally, Sir, I  think\r\n\r\nMembers of this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHouse  will agree with me that we hope that Indonesia's economic\r\n\r\ncrisis will be over soon because it is in our interest to have a\r\n\r\nprosperous Indonesia.  A prosperous Indonesia means a prosperous\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, Singapore-Indonesia\r\n\r\nrelations,  which were once described as strong and solid,  have\r\n\r\nnow become unpredictable.  Despite years of friendly cooperation\r\n\r\nand  mutual help, we now learn that past deeds and even goodwill\r\n\r\nare no guarantee to future relationships.  Indonesia will remain\r\n\r\nturbulent for some time.  Our relationship will continue  to  be\r\n\r\nuncertain,  sometimes potentially volatile.  Many  in  Indonesia\r\n\r\nfelt  that Singapore can do more to help them ease the  pain  of\r\n\r\nthe   economic  crisis.   We  have  made  offers  of   financial\r\n\r\nassistance in terms of trade financing and humanitarian aid  but\r\n\r\nconsidering  the scale of the problem, our help  will  never  be\r\n\r\nenough.  But that is where our problem will be.  So long  as  we\r\n\r\nare  seen  to  be  more  prosperous than  our  neighbours,  less\r\n\r\naffected than others in the region, and yet heavily dependent on\r\n\r\nthe  countries  around us, we will always  have  to  manage  the\r\n\r\nexpectations of having to do more to help our neighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, we must try very hard to continue giving\r\n\r\nhumanitarian aid as conditions in Indonesia continue  to  remain\r\n\r\ndifficult.   We  must do as much as we can to support  the  good\r\n\r\nwork done by the Singapore Red Cross Society.  Defence relations\r\n\r\nwith  Indonesia will remain the key to a more stable  friendship\r\n\r\nand  must be maintained at the highest level.  I am prompted  to\r\n\r\nbring  the  example  of General Winston Choo,  who  through  his\r\n\r\npersonal   and  long  relationship  with  military  leaders   in\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  has  been effective in dealing with the  potentially\r\n\r\ndifficult  issues of humanitarian aid especially when  political\r\n\r\nrelationship with Indonesia was somewhat fractured by  the  fall\r\n\r\nof  Soeharto.  In this instance, strong defence relationship has\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  fill the vacuum and gap of political  relationship.\r\n\r\nThere is also another reason for strong defence relationship\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  Indonesia.  The economic crisis has made it difficult  for\r\n\r\nmany countries in the region to continue with the rapid military\r\n\r\nexpansion  plans  which  were very much  noticeable  during  the\r\n\r\nperiod   of  strong  economic  growth.   Singapore's  consistent\r\n\r\ndefence  expenditure policy, compared to the  feast  and  famine\r\n\r\nsituation  of our neighbours, can be problematic.  Some  may  be\r\n\r\nmisunderstood into thinking that Singapore is engaged or  taking\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to be engaged in an arms race.  To  avoid  this\r\n\r\nperception, we must enhance defence cooperation through  regular\r\n\r\nmilitary  exercises and exchange.  We should increase visits  of\r\n\r\nIndonesian politicians and military leaders so that they have  a\r\n\r\ngood  view  of our position in Singapore. Creating  goodwill  by\r\n\r\nbetter understanding, knowing and helping our neighbours must be\r\n\r\nmade  part  and parcel of this renewed commitment to  be  better\r\n\r\nfriends of Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b>\r\n\r\nSir, I wish to  first reply to the colleagues who have spoken on\r\n\r\nthe  strategic  situation in Asia, then I will  comment  on  the\r\n\r\nrelations with Malaysia and Indonesia, respond to comments  made\r\n\r\non international perception by Mr Chuang.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, two Members asked about the strategic situation in\r\n\r\nour  region.  I will start off first by saying that there is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt   that  the  economic  crisis  has  altered  the  regional\r\n\r\nstrategic  landscape.   Many  economies  have  been  devastated,\r\n\r\ntriggering  off political instability in several countries.   In\r\n\r\nthis  situation,  we in Singapore have to be alert  to  possible\r\n\r\ninstability  in  the  region  and  be  prepared  for   political\r\n\r\nupheaval.   In  Indonesia, the political  and  social  situation\r\n\r\ncontinues to be uncertain.  What happens there undoubtedly  will\r\n\r\nhave  a  significant  impact on regional stability,  as  several\r\n\r\nMembers  mentioned.  Having said that, let me also say that  the\r\n\r\nprognosis  is  not entirely gloomy.  And I think there  is  some\r\n\r\nbasis  for  cautious  optimism when we  look  at  the  strategic\r\n\r\npicture  as  a whole.  The fundamentals and infrastructure  that\r\n\r\nmade possible three decades of growth are still there.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the triangular relationship between United\r\n\r\nStates,  China  and  Japan is concerned, we can  say  that  this\r\n\r\nremains fairly stable.  If it were not so, the situation can  be\r\n\r\nworse.   Stability in the triangular relationship will  continue\r\n\r\nto  provide the basic foundation for peace and security  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.    Asia's   recovery  will  in  fact  depend   on   this\r\n\r\nrelationship holding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the United States-China relations, which is an important\r\n\r\npart of this triangular relationship, in the first half of 1998,\r\n\r\nwe saw that it was stabilising at a comfortable pace.  Following\r\n\r\nPresident  Jiang Zemin's visit to the US in November  1997,  and\r\n\r\nPresident Clinton's return visit in June 1998, this demonstrated\r\n\r\nthe  United  States' commitment to constructively engage  China.\r\n\r\nBut  there  are  now signs of traditional problems  resurfacing.\r\n\r\nThese  include United States' concerns over China's human rights\r\n\r\nrecord,  the  widening  trade  deficit,  and  the  transfer   of\r\n\r\nsensitive  technology.  Underlying differences have  once  again\r\n\r\nbeen  brought to the fore.  We hope that there would  not  be  a\r\n\r\ndownturn in US-China relations as had happened in 1996.  Because\r\n\r\nthat certainly would not be in the interest of either party, and\r\n\r\nit  would  not be in the interest of the region as a whole.   We\r\n\r\nhope  that  United States-China relations can settle on  a  more\r\n\r\neven  keel after Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the United States\r\n\r\nnext month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On United States-Japan relations, the United States sought\r\n\r\ncloser  ties  with  China, there was a  perception  that  United\r\n\r\nStates-Japan  relations suffered a slide.  Japan, some  analysts\r\n\r\nsaid,  was  concerned  that the warming of US-China  ties  could\r\n\r\nundermine  the  US-Japan Security Alliance.  However,  following\r\n\r\nPresident Clinton's visit to Japan in November 1998, it restored\r\n\r\nrelations to an even keel. Notwithstanding friction in  economic\r\n\r\nand  trade  issues, the US-Japan relationship remains  the  most\r\n\r\nstable leg in the triangular relationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China-Japan relations is the other part of the triangular\r\n\r\nrelationship.   China  remains high on  Japan's  foreign  policy\r\n\r\nagenda.   President Jiang Zemin made an historic state visit  to\r\n\r\nJapan in November\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n1998,  the first by a Chinese Head of State.  However,  it  will\r\n\r\ntake   time  for  the  two  countries  to  completely   overcome\r\n\r\ntraditional   mutual   suspicions  and   to   forge   a   closer\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in Singapore's interest to have the three major\r\n\r\nplayers constructively engaged and their triangular relationship\r\n\r\nstrengthened.  This will ensure a stable and peaceful balance of\r\n\r\npower  in  the region. As Members know, Singapore has reiterated\r\n\r\nthe   importance  of  continued  US  presence  in  the   region,\r\n\r\nespecially   during  the  present  difficult  times.    Internal\r\n\r\ndomestic  changes  in  each of the powers, including  China,  we\r\n\r\nbelieve, will have an impact on their relations with each  other\r\n\r\nand the triangular relationship as a whole.  A China that lapses\r\n\r\ninto  serious  trouble,  because of an inability  to  cope  with\r\n\r\ninternal   economic   and   social  problems,   obviously   will\r\n\r\ndrastically alter the regional strategic landscape.  An unstable\r\n\r\nChina  is not in the interest of the other major powers nor  the\r\n\r\nregion as a whole.  Japan is undergoing major long-term economic\r\n\r\nand  structural  reforms and her efforts should  be  recognised,\r\n\r\nalthough  the results will take time to show.  As  for  the  US,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding  a foreign policy increasingly  subject  to  the\r\n\r\nstresses  and strains of domestic political considerations,  the\r\n\r\nUS must show global leadership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung also mentioned about Europe. Singapore\r\n\r\nwelcomes  a  stronger European engagement  in  the  region.   We\r\n\r\nbelieve  that Europe should complement its economic  involvement\r\n\r\nin the region with a greater strategic presence.  This will help\r\n\r\nto  promote regional stability and security and assist in Asia's\r\n\r\neconomic  recovery.  I might add that at the end of this  month,\r\n\r\nAsian   Foreign  Ministers  will  be  meeting  European  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters  in the Asia-Europe Foreign Ministers' meeting  to  be\r\n\r\nheld in Berlin and we expect a good discussion to take place  at\r\n\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on the other aspects of the strategic\r\n\r\nsituation  in  Asia.  First, cross-strait atmospherics  improved\r\n\r\nwith the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nStraits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Khoo Chen-fu's  visit\r\n\r\nto  China  last  October.   The scheduled  visit  to  Taiwan  of\r\n\r\nAssociation  for  Relations Across the Taiwan's Straits  (ARATS)\r\n\r\nChairman could lay the path for further progress in cross-Strait\r\n\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuclear tests in the Indian sub-continent in May 1998\r\n\r\nare a reminder to all of us that balance of powers, even outside\r\n\r\nthe  major  ones, remains a delicate issue.  The  recent  summit\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan  can  be\r\n\r\nseen as an encouraging sign of rapprochement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in North Korea continues to be a very real\r\n\r\npotential flashpoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members also referred to the territorial disputes in the\r\n\r\nSouth  China Sea.  Singapore is not a claimant state.   But  the\r\n\r\nrecent Mischief Reef incident is the latest in a  string of such\r\n\r\nless-than-friendly encounters between the claimant  states.   It\r\n\r\nhighlights the need to maintain safe passage through  the  major\r\n\r\nsea-lanes  in the region.  Freedom of navigation and  access  to\r\n\r\nsea-lanes is crucial, not only for economic development but also\r\n\r\nfor a stable security environment in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mischief Reef incident has also demonstrated the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  resolving disputes through  peaceful  means  and\r\n\r\nsubstantive  progress towards resolving contentious  issues,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, will take time, but the atmosphere of discussions has at\r\n\r\nleast improved markedly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case in reply to the Chairman of the GPC, these\r\n\r\nuncertainties  underscore the importance of a  continued  United\r\n\r\nStates' presence in the region.  Singapore also regards the Five\r\n\r\nPower  Defence Arrangement (FPDA) as an important  component  of\r\n\r\nthe  regional security architecture.  In this regard, the recent\r\n\r\ndecision  to resume the scheduled FPDA exercises is  a  positive\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to sum up, Sir, there are tentative signs of\r\n\r\neconomic recovery,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbut developments in the region remain in a state of flux.  It is\r\n\r\ndifficult to predict how the region's political equilibrium  and\r\n\r\nsecurity environment will eventually take shape, although the US-China-Japan triangular relationship will likely be stable in the\r\n\r\nnear  term.   But we have to be alert to emerging  and  changing\r\n\r\ntrends  in  the  region, and to act in ways to best  secure  our\r\n\r\nnational interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked how Singapore can position itself.\r\n\r\nWe  are  a small country, but Singapore continues to do what  we\r\n\r\ncan.  As Chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee, our objective\r\n\r\nwill  be  to  keep ASEAN together and to ensure it  maintains  a\r\n\r\nsteady  course  in difficult times.  We will also  play  a  role\r\n\r\ntogether with other members in forums such as the ASEAN Regional\r\n\r\nForum,   Asia-Europe  Meetings  as  well   as   ASEAN   dialogue\r\n\r\nrelationships with China, US and Japan to ensure that these  key\r\n\r\ncountries   continue  to  place  importance  in   the   dialogue\r\n\r\nrelationship as well as their involvement and engagement in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I now go on to comments made by colleagues on\r\n\r\nMalaysia-Singapore   relations?   This  House   last   discussed\r\n\r\nMalaysia-Singapore relations on 29th June 1998. At that time,  I\r\n\r\nupdated the House on the progress of the various items under the\r\n\r\nJoint  Communique  issued after Prime Minister  Goh's  visit  to\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur in February last year.  At that time, I reiterated\r\n\r\nthat  we  were committed to forging a long-term relationship  of\r\n\r\nmutual benefit with Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members have noted, since then our relations with\r\n\r\nMalaysia  have  seen many ups and downs.  We ran  into  a  rough\r\n\r\npatch  with  the  CIQ  issue  in July  1998,  when  we  rejected\r\n\r\nMalaysia's claim to any legal right to locate its CIQ facilities\r\n\r\nin  Tanjong  Pagar.  In July last year, I briefed the  House  at\r\n\r\nlength  on the background to the issue, and subsequently updated\r\n\r\nthe  House  on  fresh developments in October 1998  and  January\r\n\r\n1999.   I  will  refer  to  this matter  later.   In  September,\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  furore  in Malaysia over the  launch  of  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister's memoirs, Malaysia, without\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprior  notification,  unilaterally  revoked  RSAF's  access   to\r\n\r\nMalaysian airspace given under earlier agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said before, Singapore and Malaysia are\r\n\r\nreally  bound by a multiplicity of complex ties, a  point  which\r\n\r\nmore  than  one Member underscored.  Therefore, any  such  close\r\n\r\nrelationship  inevitably  must  go  through  different   phases.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we must expect ups and downs from time to  time.   As\r\n\r\ntwo  countries which are so close to each other, we  compete  as\r\n\r\nwell  as cooperate to advance our national interests.  But  what\r\n\r\nis important is that we do not lose sight of the central fact of\r\n\r\nour  interdependence.  Singapore, on its part, is  committed  to\r\n\r\nforging  a  long-term  mutually  beneficial  relationship   with\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  and  we will manage bilateral ties on  the  basis  of\r\n\r\nreciprocity and mutual respect for each other's interests.   And\r\n\r\nthis  point about mutuality and reciprocity was also alluded  to\r\n\r\nby other Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, bilateral relations improved following the meetings\r\n\r\nbetween  Prime  Minister  Goh and Dr Mahathir  in  November  and\r\n\r\nDecember  last  year.  At that time, both Prime  Ministers  were\r\n\r\nworking towards concluding a mutually beneficial water agreement\r\n\r\nin  return  for  our financial assistance to  Malaysia  under  a\r\n\r\nframework of wider cooperation.  At their last meeting in  Hanoi\r\n\r\nin  December  1998,  Dr Mahathir said that  Malaysia  no  longer\r\n\r\nneeded  financial  assistance from  Singapore.   This  has  been\r\n\r\nreported.   Instead,  Dr Mahathir proposed  that  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  could  begin  to  discuss  all  outstanding  bilateral\r\n\r\nissues,  including the long-term supply of water  to  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwithin an overall package.  Prime Minister Goh agreed to it  but\r\n\r\nhe  made  it clear that Malaysia still had to submit  its  legal\r\n\r\narguments  on the CIQ facilities first, before both sides  could\r\n\r\nbegin  negotiations  on the package. Both Prime  Ministers  then\r\n\r\nagreed that the package would include issues like the withdrawal\r\n\r\nof  West  Malaysian CPF funds, the long-term supply of water  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  KTMB land in Singapore, the RSAF's use of  Malaysian\r\n\r\nairspace and the location of Malaysia's CIQ facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I told this House on 20th January this year, we had\r\n\r\ninformed  the  Malaysians that before we could  proceed  to  the\r\n\r\nnegotiations  on the package, Malaysia would have  to  recognise\r\n\r\nSingapore's sovereignty and not claim that it had a legal  right\r\n\r\nto operate its CIQ in Singapore.  We had also informed them that\r\n\r\nif  Malaysia  did not produce its written legal arguments  in  a\r\n\r\nmonth's  time  from  20th January, Singapore would  assume  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia no longer wished to pursue its legal claim to remain at\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 10th February 1999, we received a paper from Malaysia\r\n\r\nwhich  clarified  their position on certain  issues.   In  their\r\n\r\npaper,  Malaysia  did  not claim a legal right  to  operate  its\r\n\r\ncustoms and immigration facilities in Singapore.  Together  with\r\n\r\nthe  Foreign  Minister Dato Seri Syed Hamid's public  statements\r\n\r\nthat  Malaysia had never questioned Singapore's sovereignty over\r\n\r\nits   own  territory,  the  paper  met  our  concerns  over  the\r\n\r\nsovereignty and other legal issues pertaining to Malaysia's  CIQ\r\n\r\noperations in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We replied to Malaysia on 18th February 1999 that\r\n\r\nSingapore's conclusion, after studying the Malaysian paper,  was\r\n\r\nthat  the  Malaysian government did not claim to  have  a  legal\r\n\r\nright  to  operate  its  customs and immigration  facilities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore;  that  it  acknowledged  that  these  operations   in\r\n\r\nSingapore were by Singapore's agreement and consent; and that it\r\n\r\nacknowledged  Singapore's sovereignty  over  Tanjong  Pagar  and\r\n\r\nWoodlands.   We  informed  them  that,  on  the  basis  of  that\r\n\r\nunderstanding,   Singapore  was  ready  to  proceed   with   the\r\n\r\nnegotiations on the package of outstanding issues, as agreed  by\r\n\r\nthe  two  Prime  Ministers in Hanoi.   In  this  connection,  we\r\n\r\ninvited them to suggest dates to begin the negotiations  on  the\r\n\r\npackage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, in response, the Secretary-General of\r\n\r\nMalaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed to my  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary that senior officials meet in Singapore on 11th  March\r\n\r\nto  discuss  the  package.  As our understanding  of  Malaysia's\r\n\r\nposition was not disputed, we accepted Malaysia's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproposal.  Accordingly, the first meeting between officials took\r\n\r\nplace last week on 11th March. At this first meeting, both sides\r\n\r\nhave  got  down  to  detailed discussions on the  items  in  the\r\n\r\npackage.  They have agreed to meet again in April.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that several Members who have spoken are\r\n\r\nanxiously expecting me to give a lot of details about  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened  in that one day's discussions.  But I hope  they  will\r\n\r\nappreciate that as the negotiations are still in progress, I  am\r\n\r\nnot  in a position at this stage to disclose the details of  the\r\n\r\ndiscussions on any of the specific items.  We are negotiating to\r\n\r\narrive at a mutually beneficial outcome.  As Prime Minister  Goh\r\n\r\nsaid  in  his  National Day Rally Speech last year, \"both  sides\r\n\r\nhave much to gain by pragmatic win-win cooperation.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong raised the question about the status of\r\n\r\nthe POA.  And as a result of what he has said, I should make  it\r\n\r\nclear so that Members would not misunderstand.  The fact that we\r\n\r\nare  having these discussions on the package does not mean  that\r\n\r\nagreements  that have been validly entered into  and  which  are\r\n\r\nbinding  have somehow lost their legal force.   That is not  so.\r\n\r\nAs  I  have told the House before, the POA is a legally  binding\r\n\r\nagreement  and came into force immediately after it  was  signed\r\n\r\nbetween  the  then  PM, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and  Malaysian  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister Tun Daim Zainudin in 1990.  However, Prime Minister Goh\r\n\r\nhas  said  that the Singapore Government is prepared to consider\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  proposals to have supplementary  agreements  on  the\r\n\r\nPOA,  but  only  in  the context of a wider framework  or  wider\r\n\r\npackage  with Malaysia that includes Malaysia selling  water  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  on  a  long term basis.  Therefore, the  decision  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss the POA as part of the package of bilateral issues  does\r\n\r\nnot in any way affect the legal status of the POA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an analogy. The bilateral discussions on the\r\n\r\npackage  include our request for extension of the 1961 and  1962\r\n\r\nwater agreements.  The fact that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nextension  of the water agreements is being discussed  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that the two agreements are in any way suspended.  And  if\r\n\r\nthe  package  deal does not produce results on the extension  of\r\n\r\nthe  water  agreements, the water agreements  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nremain valid until their expiry dates.  I thought I should  make\r\n\r\nthat clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I think Mr Charles Chong and one or two other\r\n\r\nMembers  also  asked about the CIQ.  Likewise, the  Government's\r\n\r\nposition,  as I stated in the House on the status  of  the  CIQ,\r\n\r\nremains  unchanged.   Members will recall that  I  explained  in\r\n\r\ngreat  length  why  Malaysia's CIQ could not remain  in  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  after  we had moved to Woodlands.  I also explained  that\r\n\r\nwhen  Singapore's  CIQ  moved to Woodlands,  the  administrative\r\n\r\narrangements  and the legal cover for Malaysia to  exercise  CIQ\r\n\r\nfunctions  in  Tanjong Pagar ceased.  Also, I mentioned  serious\r\n\r\nproblems which might be created concerning the improper sequence\r\n\r\nof  immigration clearance, especially if passports were endorsed\r\n\r\nat  Tanjong  Pagar.   However, because  Malaysia  at  that  time\r\n\r\nclaimed  a  legal  right for its customs to  remain  in  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar,  we  agreed,  as an interim measure, to  allow  Malaysian\r\n\r\ncustoms to operate at Tanjong Pagar pending a resolution of  its\r\n\r\nclaim  by its Singapore customs officers lending cover of  legal\r\n\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, again in line with the agreement between the two\r\n\r\nPrime Ministers in Hanoi to resolve the CIQ issue as part of the\r\n\r\npackage  of bilateral issues, Prime Minister Goh had  said  also\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  prepared to consider the question of the  possible\r\n\r\nlocation  of the Malaysian CIQ in Singapore provided that  there\r\n\r\nis an overall package agreement.  However, at that time, he said\r\n\r\nwe  must settle the issue of sovereignty and Malaysia's claim of\r\n\r\na  legal right before proceeding to the negotiations.  As I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  we  are glad to have put the legal issues behind  us  and\r\n\r\nhave  moved on to the negotiations on the package of outstanding\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question was asked about the time frame and whether we\r\n\r\nshould  give a deadline.  I agree with the Member that a package\r\n\r\nwhich  involves  so many issues and of such magnitude  obviously\r\n\r\ncannot  be  rushed.  But I also think he is right that  if  both\r\n\r\nsides are earnest, then it should not drag on indefinitely.   He\r\n\r\nis  right.  But I believe that the officials are fully aware  of\r\n\r\nthis fact and they know that the two Prime Ministers expect them\r\n\r\nto achieve early progress in their talks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked how do we ensure that these\r\n\r\nagreements,  when they are reached as a result of  the  package,\r\n\r\nwill  be  respected  and  they  will  be  binding  international\r\n\r\nagreements   with  full  force  of  validity   and   status   in\r\n\r\ninternational  law,  and will be governed by international  law.\r\n\r\nHe  will recall that the Prime Minister has told the House  that\r\n\r\nwhen  we spoke about loan and water arrangements, he would bring\r\n\r\nit  to  Parliament.   I  know that it is  the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nintention  that  the  agreements, as a  result  of  the  package\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  would also be brought to this  House.   I  assume\r\n\r\nthat this will be done likewise in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin made some useful suggestions about\r\n\r\npromoting  bilateral relations and, as a general principle,  one\r\n\r\nwould find it very difficult to disagree with him.  I agree with\r\n\r\nhim that civic organisations and NGOs have an important role  to\r\n\r\nplay.   Not only do I agree with him, it is important to  stress\r\n\r\nthat  in  diplomacy  and  the conduct  of  foreign  policy,  the\r\n\r\npromotion  of bilateral relations is not the sole responsibility\r\n\r\nand  preserve  of  the  Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs  or  Prime\r\n\r\nMinisters  or  Foreign  Ministers.   Other   officials,  private\r\n\r\nsector,  NGOs and civic groups also can supplement the  work  of\r\n\r\nthe Government agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned re-establishing sports and cultural links, but\r\n\r\nthese  have  always existed.  The point I want to make  is  that\r\n\r\nSingapore,  on  its part, has not made any move  to  stop  these\r\n\r\nlinks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now go on to the points made by colleagues on\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  Sir, last year on 1st June 1998, I informed  Members\r\n\r\nthat though Indonesia is in political transition, Singapore will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  work with Indonesia, both bilaterally  and  within\r\n\r\nASEAN,  to further strengthen relations to the benefit  of  both\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have already pointed out that Singapore is\r\n\r\na  small  country  with limited means.  I  believe  Mr  Zulkifli\r\n\r\nunderscored  that point. We have limited means  to  resolve  the\r\n\r\nmagnitude  of  the  needs of Indonesians in  the  political  and\r\n\r\neconomic crisis.  When the crisis started, we sought the support\r\n\r\nof  Indonesia's major trading partners for a Multilateral  Trade\r\n\r\nFinance  Guarantee Scheme because we knew that we were not  able\r\n\r\nto  do  it alone. As most of these countries preferred  to  have\r\n\r\ntheir  own  bilateral  schemes, we did not pursue  the  proposal\r\n\r\nfurther.   When  Indonesia  pressed us,  Singapore  subsequently\r\n\r\noffered its own Bilateral Trade Financing Guarantee Scheme  with\r\n\r\ndiffidence  because we did not have the expertise in this  area.\r\n\r\nThe Indonesians found our scheme too cautious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the economic crisis had caused hardships for the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Indonesia, Members know that Singapore announced  in\r\n\r\nJuly  last year our humanitarian assistance package in the  form\r\n\r\nof  rice  and  medicines.   Another phase  of  the  humanitarian\r\n\r\nassistance  under this package will be launched  soon.   I  note\r\n\r\nwhat Mr Sin Boon Ann has said, but since the current package  of\r\n\r\nhumanitarian assistance is not over, we will have to assess this\r\n\r\nmatter later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current difficulties in Indonesia have not stopped\r\n\r\nus from investing in Indonesia.  In January 1999, both countries\r\n\r\nsigned  an  agreement for the gas project in  the  West  Natunas\r\n\r\nwhich is expected to generate revenues of about US$8 billion for\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   This  project reflects the strong  commitment  from\r\n\r\nSingapore   to   work  together  with  Indonesia   in   economic\r\n\r\ncooperation amidst the on-going crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as with our other efforts to be of help, Singapore can\r\n\r\nact as a catalyst to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbring  back foreign investments into Indonesia when the position\r\n\r\nis  stabilised.   We  can  co-invest  with  big  MNCs  in  their\r\n\r\nindustrial  and  agricultural sector.  By ourselves,  we  cannot\r\n\r\nmake  a  significant  difference.   But  getting  big  MNCs   to\r\n\r\naccompany   us  can  be  useful  in  restarting  the   flow   of\r\n\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Indonesia is undergoing a political transformation.\r\n\r\nIt  has to overcome deep economic, social and political problems\r\n\r\non   its  road  to  recovery.   Eventually,  they  will  restore\r\n\r\npolitical stability and confidence.  But along the way, we  have\r\n\r\nto  expect  stresses  and  strains that  will  affect  bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have indeed commented the fact that relations\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore and Indonesia are going through  a  difficult\r\n\r\nperiod.   Various  Indonesian leaders and  officials  have  made\r\n\r\nallegations and negative comments against Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is pointless for me to give a detailed\r\n\r\nrebuttal of all the various allegations that have been  made  in\r\n\r\nan  off-hand  manner  without  any  supporting  facts  to  these\r\n\r\nallegations.   Let  me, however, restate that  Singapore  has  a\r\n\r\nvested interest in Indonesia's stability, growth and prosperity.\r\n\r\nIndonesia is a close neighbour and a major trading partner.   As\r\n\r\nMr   Rai  mentioned,  an  Indonesian  setback  would  hurt   its\r\n\r\nneighbours, including Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On these criticisms, I can do no better than to refer to\r\n\r\nthe speech made by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew on 20th February\r\n\r\n1999  as well as Prime Minister Goh's comments made in Australia\r\n\r\nrecently.  Senior Minister Lee said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As the internal situations of the crisis-hit countries\r\n\r\nworsened,  there have been more accusations and threats  against\r\n\r\nSingapore.  When countries are under pressure, their leaders say\r\n\r\nand do things that they normally would not.  We must expect more\r\n\r\nof this.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the run-up to the Indonesian parliamentary elections in\r\n\r\nJune  1999, and the Presidential elections later this  year,  we\r\n\r\ncan expect more allegations to be directed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagainst  us.   But  we  have to avoid  being  drawn  into  their\r\n\r\npolitics.  As Prime Minister Goh said, we should say the minimum\r\n\r\nso  as to avoid giving any provocation.  Singapore would try  to\r\n\r\navoid being a party in Indonesia's domestic elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we hope that Indonesia will succeed in overcoming its\r\n\r\nchallenges   to  restore  political  certainty  and  confidence.\r\n\r\nStability in Indonesia will be the key factor.  In this  regard,\r\n\r\nthe  outcome  of  the  coming elections  in  Indonesia  will  be\r\n\r\ncritical.  It is important that the elections be seen to be free\r\n\r\nand  fair.   Otherwise, it may prolong the political instability\r\n\r\nand the loss of investor confidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli touched on the importance of working relations\r\n\r\nbetween  different agencies.  Let me say that, in the  meantime,\r\n\r\nthe  working relationship between Singapore Government  agencies\r\n\r\nand  their Indonesian counterparts have not been affected by the\r\n\r\nchanges taking place there.  Cooperation in various fields, I am\r\n\r\nglad  to say, is still going on.  For instance, my Ministry  has\r\n\r\ncontinued  to work closely with DEPLU, which is their Indonesian\r\n\r\nForeign   Ministry,  both  bilaterally  and   at   the   various\r\n\r\ninternational fora.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to reaffirm that the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment is prepared to work with whoever becomes President of\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and  forms the next government.   We  will  establish\r\n\r\nrational  and  stable long-term relations with Indonesia  as  we\r\n\r\nhave  done in the past 30 years, a relationship based on  mutual\r\n\r\nrespect and equality between two independent countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Dr Ong Chit Chung touched on the assistance given\r\n\r\nto  Singaporeans caught in the crisis.  As a result of that,  he\r\n\r\nasked  what is the nature of assistance which Singapore MFA  can\r\n\r\ngive.   I  thank him for what he has said about MFA.  It  was  a\r\n\r\ncombined   effort  between  MFA  and  various  other  Government\r\n\r\nagencies.   But in answer to what else can be done, let  me  say\r\n\r\nthat  one of MFA's primary roles is to provide advice and assist\r\n\r\noverseas Singaporeans when they are in trouble\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabroad, or they need our support and information.  This is quite\r\n\r\ntrue,  particularly  as Dr Ong mentioned,  when  more  and  more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are travelling and residing overseas, either due to\r\n\r\ntheir own efforts or because of our own regionalisation efforts.\r\n\r\nLet me say that all our overseas missions have contingency plans\r\n\r\nto   meet   various  exigencies.   Wherever  there   are   large\r\n\r\nconcentrations  of Singaporeans, we also put in place  a  warden\r\n\r\nsystem  to  facilitate speedy communications among Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially   during   emergency  situations,   such   as   civil\r\n\r\ndisturbances  or  natural disasters.  Under the  warden  system,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  organised  into  groupings  based  on   their\r\n\r\ngeographical  localities with wardens or leaders  appointed  for\r\n\r\neach  group.  This system proves very effective in Cambodia when\r\n\r\nover  400  Singaporeans were successfully  evacuated.   We  also\r\n\r\nactivated   the   warden  system  for  evacuating   some   2,000\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  were  flown  back  from  Indonesia  with  the\r\n\r\ncooperation of SIA at that time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chuang's point on international perception of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  take Mr Chuang's point that MFA and its  overseas\r\n\r\nmissions  should do as much as possible (a) to counter  negative\r\n\r\nperceptions,   unfounded  allegations   and   criticisms   about\r\n\r\nSingapore; and (b) to be proactively promoting a positive  image\r\n\r\nabout  Singapore.  In fact, this is one of the key functions  of\r\n\r\nour missions abroad.  But as he himself has noted, Singapore  is\r\n\r\na  small  country.   We  have less than  30  resident  embassies\r\n\r\nthroughout the world.  But every one of our embassies knows  the\r\n\r\ncritical importance of doing this.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also talked about the use of the Internet. I agree\r\n\r\nwith  him  on  the  growing importance of the Internet  and  its\r\n\r\nusefulness as a tool to explain our policies to Singaporeans and\r\n\r\nforeigners.   And  MFA,  in fact, has  recognised  the  need  to\r\n\r\nprovide the latest information to an ever more discerning public\r\n\r\nthrough  this  media.  He may not know that, in  fact,  MFA  has\r\n\r\nrevamped its home page last June\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproviding  for  more  timely release of  our  press  statements,\r\n\r\nspeeches, and so forth.  The site is now more user-friendly  and\r\n\r\naverages over 200,000 hits every month.  We have encouraged  our\r\n\r\noverseas  missions to publish their home pages so that they  can\r\n\r\nbe more effective in their own way to reach out to the audiences\r\n\r\nin  their  countries.   So far, our missions  in  Kuala  Lumpur,\r\n\r\nJakarta, New York and Paris have launched their own home  pages.\r\n\r\nLondon  and  Shanghai will have theirs later in the  month.   In\r\n\r\nfinancial year 1999, my Ministry will launch another 11 websites\r\n\r\nfor  all  our  overseas  missions.  In  addition  to  that,  our\r\n\r\nembassies  also issue newsletters, and so on.  So  these  things\r\n\r\nare being done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, I think we need to have a proper\r\n\r\nperspective   in  addressing  the  question  of  perception   or\r\n\r\nmisperception,  as mentioned by the Member.  I  would  say  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's general international image is not really  negative.\r\n\r\nIt  is, in fact, positive.  In recent weeks and months, in fact,\r\n\r\nmany stories were written in well-known reputed newspapers about\r\n\r\nthe  way in which Singapore had handled its own economy  in  the\r\n\r\nmidst  of the regional financial crisis.  What we have done  has\r\n\r\nbeen  noted.   Of  course, from time to time,  negative  stories\r\n\r\nabout  Singapore will appear in the international  media.   When\r\n\r\nthese   negative  stories  are  based  on  misunderstanding   or\r\n\r\ninaccurate  information, our overseas missions  proactively  and\r\n\r\nrobustly will correct such misperceptions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the end of the day, I think the crux of the problem\r\n\r\nis  not  lack of information or inaccurate information.  Because\r\n\r\nthere  is always a small group of critics or foreign media  that\r\n\r\nis  ideologically uncomfortable with Singapore.  We have to face\r\n\r\nthis,  because  we  do not fit their preconceptions  of  what  a\r\n\r\nsuccessful  developing  country should  be.   So  no  amount  of\r\n\r\ndissemination  of accurate information or effort  at  correcting\r\n\r\nthem  is going to change their mindset.  Yes, we keep on trying,\r\n\r\nand we will not stop trying.   In fact, these critics would want\r\n\r\nto  change us to fit their ideas of what we ought to be.  Unless\r\n\r\nwe change, these critics will not be satisfied.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But obviously we should not change ourselves just to oblige\r\n\r\nthis  small  group of critics.  Their views are not  necessarily\r\n\r\nshared  by a majority of Western policy-makers or Western public\r\n\r\nat  large, as the Member has pointed out.  Many people supported\r\n\r\nthe actions we took.  So I think we should not be too rattled by\r\n\r\nsuch criticisms.  Of course, we should not blow our own trumpet.\r\n\r\nWe  have our policies which we think work for us and where  they\r\n\r\nwork  for us, we will continue to pursue these policies.   Where\r\n\r\nthey do not work, obviously we will re-examine our policies  and\r\n\r\ndecisions,  and adjust.  We do not insist that  what  we  do  is\r\n\r\nright for the rest of the world and we do not seek to impose our\r\n\r\npolicies  on  the others.  So we have to be very clear  of  this\r\n\r\nperspective when we deal with the comment made by the Member  on\r\n\r\ncorrecting international perception of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, on what we have discussed just\r\n\r\nnow,  I  think it should be clear to the policy-makers in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur,  and  also  in Jakarta, that Singapore and  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwant to have good relations with our neighbouring countries, but\r\n\r\non an equal basis and as sovereign nations, and as good partners\r\n\r\nwithin ASEAN.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, Sir, in terms of Singapore-Thai relations, I\r\n\r\nwant  to  say that Singapore-Thai relations have been  warm  and\r\n\r\nvery constructive, and beneficial to both sides.  There has been\r\n\r\nrecognition by Singaporeans and Thais that we have much to learn\r\n\r\nfrom each other, and much to gain in cooperation and partnership\r\n\r\nin the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early February 1999, the Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\nled  a  delegation of senior officials from the Singapore  Civil\r\n\r\nService  to  attend  a meeting with their Thai  counterparts  in\r\n\r\nBangkok.   Would the Minister brief the House on the outcome  of\r\n\r\nthis  meeting  and other recent initiatives to expand  bilateral\r\n\r\ncooperation  with Thailand?  What are the steps that  have  been\r\n\r\ntaken to realise the vision of a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore-Thailand Enhanced Partnership, which has  been  called\r\n\r\nor  abbreviated as STEP, that the Prime Minister launched during\r\n\r\nhis official visit to Thailand in June 1997?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will give us a step-by-step account of\r\n\r\nthis bilateral relationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I go on to the next amendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore and Australia have a\r\n\r\nlong-standing  relationship, a deep  and,  I  may  say,  abiding\r\n\r\nrelationship, over many, many years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In World War II, Australia sent its servicemen to defend\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Some died in the field, never to return  home.   And\r\n\r\nmany were later imprisoned at Changi.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the post-war era, Australia is our strong partner in\r\n\r\ndefence  through  the  Five  Power  Defence  Arrangement.    The\r\n\r\neconomic  ties  between Singapore and Australia are  strong  and\r\n\r\ngrowing day by day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just weeks ago, the Singapore Australia Joint Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  held  its  meeting in Singapore, and  shortly  after,\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Goh Chok Tong visited Australia himself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister to brief this House on the\r\n\r\nsignificance and outcome of the recent Singapore Australia Joint\r\n\r\nMinisterial  Committee meeting and the visit of  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nGoh Chok Tong to Australia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, at the invitation of the Hong Kong\r\n\r\nLegislative Council, Parliament sent a delegation to  Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nin  the  last  week  of  January this year.   Seven  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  participated, and the Hong Kong Legislative  Council\r\n\r\narranged a full programme for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndelegation.  I am happy to report that throughout the visit,  we\r\n\r\ncould  feel  that the welcome extended to us by the  Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil,  the  various  Hong  Kong government  departments,  and\r\n\r\nauthorities  such  as the Housing Authority, the  Transportation\r\n\r\nDepartment,  was  warm  and genuine.  The Hong  Kong  government\r\n\r\nofficials were friendly and open and were very willing to  share\r\n\r\nwith  us  their  difficulties, problems  and  information.   The\r\n\r\ndelegation   felt   that  to  a  great  extent,   the   friendly\r\n\r\nrelationship between the two territories owed much to the effort\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Consul-General, Mr Chan Heng Wing, a  man  of\r\n\r\nseemingly boundless energy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our dialogue sessions at the stately legislative\r\n\r\nbuilding, members of the two legislatures concluded that the so-called  \"tension\"  between Hong Kong and  Singapore  is  more  a\r\n\r\nperception, resulting from the reporting by the news  media,  in\r\n\r\nparticular  the foreign media, and that it does not reflect  the\r\n\r\ntrue feelings of the people of Hong Kong and Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, it is rather surprising to learn of the verbal\r\n\r\noutburst  of Mr Chau Tak Hay, the Hong Kong Secretary  of  Trade\r\n\r\nand Industry in the Legislative Council when he commented on the\r\n\r\nextent  of control in the Singapore society.  Sir, with all  due\r\n\r\nrespect to the Secretary, I am afraid that his understanding  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  rather  shallow for a man  of  his  standing  and\r\n\r\nbackground.  Perhaps we should invite the Secretary, Mr Chau, to\r\n\r\nSingapore, and spend some time with us.  At the very  least,  we\r\n\r\nshould send him a copy of SM's book, \"The Singapore Story\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister to give us an assessment of the\r\n\r\nrelations between Hong Kong and Singapore, and whether there  is\r\n\r\nany strained relationship that needs to be looked into?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore has taken over the\r\n\r\nchairmanship  of  the  ASEAN Standing Committee  and  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nRegional Forum, two key appointments within ASEAN, just when the\r\n\r\nregion  is  undergoing  tremendous  economic  difficulties   and\r\n\r\ncrisis.

And in this context, I would encourage us  to  see\r\n\r\nour  assistance as having to increase, but not just in terms  of\r\n\r\nmoney  but  in  terms  of  technical cooperation,  training  and\r\n\r\nassisting in dialogue as a bridge between our ASEAN members  and\r\n\r\nthe  wider world.  In this, I think Singapore, despite  whatever\r\n\r\ncriticisms  may  come our way, must not be  silent  nor  be  too\r\n\r\nsensitive but should lead quietly and effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I am looking to the Minister for his\r\n\r\nthoughts  on his plan of action and taking a longer  term  about\r\n\r\nthe  ASEAN  20-20 Vision, working not just with the older  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmembers  but,  particularly,  with  the  new  ASEAN  members  of\r\n\r\nIndochina and Myanmar in the ASEAN's enlargement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would call on the Minister to think not only of the\r\n\r\nshorter  term  but also the longer term policies  to  help  this\r\n\r\nregion deal with what is potentially a lost generation of  youth\r\n\r\nand  to  think of things that may not be so realistic like  now,\r\n\r\nbut  to lay the groundwork for future developments, such  as  an\r\n\r\nASEAN university.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take the next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, carry on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> This concerns the ARF. Very briefly, again,\r\n\r\nSingapore as Chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfinds  itself  chairing the ASEAN Regional  Forum.   This  forum\r\n\r\nallows  ASEAN  and Singapore to engage with a much larger  Asia-Pacific  footprint and with many of the major powers.  ASEAN  in\r\n\r\nthis  forum  is  meant to be in the driver's  seat.   Yet,  many\r\n\r\ncommentators  have been concerned that tensions and  differences\r\n\r\nbetween  ASEAN have disabled ASEAN from being truly the  driver.\r\n\r\nI  will  ask the Minister to share his thoughts about using  the\r\n\r\nASEAN Regional Forum to continue to engage USA, China, Japan and\r\n\r\nindeed Europe which are all members of the ARF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on the ARF, Sir, if I may ask the Minister to concern\r\n\r\nhimself  with  the ideas of confidence building  and  preventive\r\n\r\ndiplomacy as new stages of the ASEAN Regional Forum.  Sir, in my\r\n\r\nmain  speech  on  the finance policy of this Government,  I  was\r\n\r\nconcerned about the defence spending, not simply as a matter  of\r\n\r\na  military build-up.  I do not think that is our intention.  My\r\n\r\nconcern then was much more the perception of our neighbours  and\r\n\r\nthe  wider region.  Would the Minister consider using the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nRegional Forum for confidence building measures (CBMs), dialogue\r\n\r\nand transparency in this regard?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore has taken a strong\r\n\r\nposition  at the Sixth ASEAN Summit in Hanoi over the timing  of\r\n\r\nCambodia's  admission  into  ASEAN.   Can  the  Minister  please\r\n\r\nexplain  why  Singapore has objected to the  full  admission  of\r\n\r\nCambodia  at  the  Hanoi  Summit?  What  is  the  latest  status\r\n\r\nregarding Cambodia's desire to become a member of ASEAN?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I move on to the next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister wants to reply.

We cannot deny\r\n\r\nthat  ASEAN  is  going through a very difficult period  and  the\r\n\r\nregional  economic  crisis has really affected  all  members  of\r\n\r\nASEAN.   Some  are experiencing internal political stresses  and\r\n\r\nstrains.  There have been bilateral issues amongst two  or  more\r\n\r\nASEAN countries.  Members are right that outside observers  have\r\n\r\nexpressed  all  sorts of comments and prognosis  for  ASEAN  and\r\n\r\nASEAN's  future  directions.   Because of these developments  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  year or so, it has led to perceptions that  ASEAN  is\r\n\r\nweakened  or in a state of disarray.  My view is that we  should\r\n\r\nnot  deny  that  ASEAN is indeed going through  a  very  testing\r\n\r\nperiod.   On the other hand, to be balanced, I would  not  paint\r\n\r\ntoo gloomy and pessimistic a prognosis for ASEAN.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the issue of bilateral relations problems\r\n\r\nbetween  some ASEAN countries.  Yes, it has happened.   Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  Singapore have had their problems and we are not  the  only\r\n\r\nones.   Some other countries have also had their bilateral spats\r\n\r\nand  skirmishes.   But let us get things in perspective.   These\r\n\r\nproblems  have  always existed and it is not the first  time  or\r\n\r\nlast  time  that ASEAN will encounter such difficulties.   ASEAN\r\n\r\nhas   weathered  such  storms  before  and  fortunately  emerged\r\n\r\nstronger.  This is quite a remarkable thing about ASEAN.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may quote two personal anecdotes from my experience.\r\n\r\nWhen  relations with Malaysia were at times chilly  and  frosty,\r\n\r\nthere  was no problem in my picking up the phone and talking  to\r\n\r\nthe then Foreign Minister Badawi on a variety of matters.  In my\r\n\r\ncapacity as Chairman of ASEAN, I had discussed various proposals\r\n\r\nand  got  his agreement on the phone, particularly,  when  there\r\n\r\nwere  fast  moving events like on Cambodia.   That  was  a  good\r\n\r\nillustration of how ASEAN works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, going back a few years back, when we had this\r\n\r\nbilateral  problem with the Philippines over the  case  of  Flor\r\n\r\nContemplacion, it was clear that both of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nus  did not want the issue to affect ASEAN, or ASEAN unity.   In\r\n\r\nfact, Philippines and Singapore continued to cooperate on a wide\r\n\r\nvariety of measures in ASEAN.  Here, again, there was no problem\r\n\r\nin  the Foreign Minister and myself being in frequent contact on\r\n\r\nthe  telephone.  So I think ASEAN's strength is to be  found  in\r\n\r\nthe  habit of consultations, personal ties and a strong  network\r\n\r\nof  institutional links which were developed over a period of 30\r\n\r\nyears.   We  have  come to a stage where we have  discussed  our\r\n\r\nproblems  honestly  but  quietly.  ASEAN Foreign  Ministers  and\r\n\r\nofficials  continue  to  meet regularly  despite  the  bilateral\r\n\r\nproblems and I think the comfort levels are quite high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Hanoi Summit last year, ASEAN leaders, without\r\n\r\nexception,  felt  a  strong sense of purpose  to  restore  ASEAN\r\n\r\nstanding and they adopted a forward looking Hanoi plan of action\r\n\r\nand Hanoi declaration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked about the chairmanship of ASEAN standing\r\n\r\ncommittee.   In that capacity, Singapore would have to  work  to\r\n\r\nensure  that ASEAN countries continue to work together  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  regional  economic crisis.  It is  very  likely  that\r\n\r\nCambodia  will  join  ASEAN  soon.   So  the  Foreign  Ministers\r\n\r\nMinisterial Meeting which Singapore would have to host  in  July\r\n\r\nthis  year  will  be the first time that all ten  ASEAN  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters  will meet together.  It is an important occasion  for\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers  to  discuss  how the  ten  countries  will  work\r\n\r\ntogether to strengthen ASEAN and its future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As chair of the ARF, we also want to see the habit of\r\n\r\ndialogue and consultation strengthened.  I believe ARF plays  an\r\n\r\nimportant role in building confidence among its countries in the\r\n\r\nregion which contributes peace and stability.  And I will say  a\r\n\r\nfew  more  words about ARF.  I was asked whether  Singapore  can\r\n\r\nplay  a  leadership  role in opening new markets  amongst  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmembers.   The  new ASEAN countries actually understand,  in  my\r\n\r\nview,  the importance of economic liberalization and the opening\r\n\r\nup of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomies.   As members of ASEAN, they have committed themselves\r\n\r\nto  participating in the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and  ASEAN\r\n\r\nInvestment  Area  (AIA).  The participation will  lead  them  to\r\n\r\nlower  their  barriers and encourage a free  flow  of  trade  in\r\n\r\nASEAN.   Singapore will work with the new ASEAN members to  help\r\n\r\nthem integrate into AFTA and also the global economy.  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  share  with  these  countries our  experience  in  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment and familiarise them with measures that can  improve\r\n\r\nthe   business  conditions  and  investment  climate.   I  think\r\n\r\nSingapore's  regionalisation programme will also help.   But  in\r\n\r\nthe final analysis, much will depend on the private sector.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  in  seeking business opportunities in the new  markets,\r\n\r\nthe private sector will look for a business environment which is\r\n\r\nconducive to open trade and investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked about ASEAN-EU relations and how is it that\r\n\r\nproblems  have arisen.  Dr Ong Chit Chung is right that ASEAN-EU\r\n\r\ndialogue  has  run  into rough waters.  In  fact,  it  is  at  a\r\n\r\nstandstill.   Why  is  that  so?  It  is  because  of  the  EU's\r\n\r\ndifficulties  over Myanmar's participation in two key  meetings.\r\n\r\nOne is the ASEAN-European Commission Joint Cooperation Committee\r\n\r\n(JCC)  which is really a technical meeting to review cooperation\r\n\r\nactivities.   The other meeting which has run into  difficulties\r\n\r\nis  ASEAN-EU  Foreign Ministers Meeting which was to  have  been\r\n\r\nheld back-to-back with the Asia-Europe Foreign Ministers Meeting\r\n\r\nin  Berlin.  The JCC, the technical meeting, was postponed twice\r\n\r\ndue  to  a disagreement between ASEAN and EU over the format  of\r\n\r\nMyanmar's  participation, and both ASEAN and EU are now  working\r\n\r\ntowards  reconvening the meeting.  But the prospects  of  having\r\n\r\nthe  ASEAN-EU Foreign Ministers Meeting on 30th March in Berlin,\r\n\r\nI am afraid, appear rather dim at this stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem is that the European Union's common\r\n\r\nposition  is  not  to  grant  a visa to  the  Myanmar's  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister.   The  European  Union  would  like   Myanmar  to   be\r\n\r\nrepresented  at  a  more  junior  level.   But  as  the  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters Meeting is a ministerial meeting at the Foreign\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinisters'  level,  ASEAN's position is that all  ASEAN  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters will have to be present and treated equally.  In other\r\n\r\nwords,  there  should  not be any discrimination  on  any  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmember's  participation and it will be difficult  for  ASEAN  to\r\n\r\nleave  behind one member and the rest of us attend the  meeting.\r\n\r\nIt  is  unfortunate  that  some of the EU  countries'  bilateral\r\n\r\ndifficulties with Myanmar on its internal human rights situation\r\n\r\nhave   jeopardised   the   long   standing   ASEAN-EU   dialogue\r\n\r\npartnership.  I say that because, over the past 22 years,  ASEAN\r\n\r\nand  EU  have built well-entrenched institutional structures  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  broad  based  functional and  economic  cooperation.\r\n\r\nThis  well-established relationship is one that ASEAN  continues\r\n\r\nto value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the EU could take into account the larger\r\n\r\ninterests of the dialogue.  My colleagues in ASEAN actually  are\r\n\r\nrather puzzled by the EU position because the European Union has\r\n\r\nno  problems  sitting with the Myanmar Foreign Minister  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  table at the ASEAN Regional Forum when it is held  in  our\r\n\r\nregion.   They  also have no problem sitting  with  the  Myanmar\r\n\r\nForeign  Minister  when ASEAN has its post-ministerial  dialogue\r\n\r\nwith  the European Union after the ASEAN meeting.  So they  find\r\n\r\nthis rather inconsistent.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked about the ARF. The ARF has actually\r\n\r\ncome a fairly long way since it was established in 1994.  It  is\r\n\r\nthe  only regional forum that brings in all the major powers  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  regional security issues.  It has, over the  past  five\r\n\r\nyears,  managed  to build up a certain comfort level  and  trust\r\n\r\namong its participants so much so that in recent sessions,  even\r\n\r\nsensitive  issues have been discussed.  The 5th ARF  in  Manila,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  saw a very candid exchange of views  on  regional\r\n\r\nsecurity  issues, including the impact of the financial  crisis.\r\n\r\nThere  was  also a candid exchange of views over the South-Asian\r\n\r\nnuclear tests.  That these issues have now been discussed  in  a\r\n\r\nnon-confrontational manner, to me, it is a sign of how  the  ARF\r\n\r\nhas managed to increase and build up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconfidence among the participating countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to ARF's future and resilience is, even though\r\n\r\nindividual  countries  have different operating  styles,  it  is\r\n\r\nARF's adherence to the principles of consultation and consensus.\r\n\r\nI  believe that the future of ARF is hinged on to the mindset of\r\n\r\nthe countries in the forum.  Hopefully, our constant interaction\r\n\r\nwill  inculcate  habits of dialogue and cooperation  instead  of\r\n\r\nconfrontation.   Although the comfort level  has  increased,  we\r\n\r\nhave to deal with decades of suspicion and distrust which cannot\r\n\r\nbe  obliterated within a space of a few years.  This  is  why  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that the process of the ARF and the exchanging of  views\r\n\r\nare important.  If the countries are more assured by the process\r\n\r\nof  consultation and consensus, something which I place a lot of\r\n\r\nemphasis,  it  will  lead  to  increased  trust  and  eventually\r\n\r\ncooperation.   I  might mention here that as an illustration  of\r\n\r\nconsultation that even before the ARF is held, I have written to\r\n\r\nall  the  Foreign Ministers of the ARF participating  countries,\r\n\r\nsoliciting  their views on how they see the ARF, to be  held  in\r\n\r\nJuly  this  year, to move forward, and I have told them  that  I\r\n\r\nwill take their views into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I do not foresee the ARF rapidly becoming a\r\n\r\ndispute  resolution forum, I share Mr Simon Tay's view  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  probably  try  to  move several incremental  steps  from\r\n\r\nconfidence building measures to a stage of preventive diplomacy.\r\n\r\nMr  Simon Tay ended up his speech referring to assistance  which\r\n\r\nwe  can give to regional countries.  I am not sure whether  time\r\n\r\nwill  permit, but one of the questions which was raised by other\r\n\r\nMembers concerns technical cooperation and he will know that the\r\n\r\nrecord shows that Singapore, in fact, is doing a lot within  the\r\n\r\nlimited  resources that we have under its technical  cooperation\r\n\r\nprogramme.   We  spend a lot of money, we train  thousands  from\r\n\r\nvarious  countries and the majority of participants who  benefit\r\n\r\nare from the countries in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your permission, my colleague, the Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary drew my attention to the  fact  that  I\r\n\r\ninadvertently omitted to reply to Dr Wang Kai Yuen, although  it\r\n\r\nwas on an earlier matter, when he asked me for information about\r\n\r\nthe bridge proposal.  In response, let me say that the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  not  received any proposal from  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment  on  the development of a new bridge to  replace  the\r\n\r\nCauseway.   As  I have said before, and so has the Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development,  any proposal for  such  a  project  will\r\n\r\nrequire  the approval of both governments.  Of course, Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  seriously consider any initiative that will foster  closer\r\n\r\ncooperation  between  Singapore  and  Malaysia.   Naturally,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  give  a  response in abstract terms.  We  need  to  know\r\n\r\npertinent details.  Why is there a need to replace the  Causeway\r\n\r\nwith  a  bridge in the first place?  What will the whole project\r\n\r\ncost be and what are the cost benefits?  Will the Singapore  end\r\n\r\nproperly tie up with the Woodlands train checkpoint?  What  will\r\n\r\nbe  the toll charges, if any?  All these must be addressed,  not\r\n\r\nas  a  private  sector  proposal, but in  a  proposal  from  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  of Malaysia.  So we need a formal proposal,  and  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  one from the Malaysian government, we will of  course\r\n\r\nconsider it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Dr Ow Chin</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Hock):</b> Sir, let me first respond to Dr Ong's comments on\r\n\r\nThailand-Singapore relations.  Over the last two years, Thailand-Singapore   bilateral   relations  have  further   strengthened,\r\n\r\ncharacterised by the increased regularity of high-level meetings\r\n\r\nand  exchanges  of  visits between the two countries.   This  is\r\n\r\nattributable   to   two  major  initiatives:  Singapore-Thailand\r\n\r\nEnhanced Partnership (STEP) and Thailand-Singapore Civil Service\r\n\r\nCooperation  Programme (CSEP).  Both initiatives  were  launched\r\n\r\nduring  the official visit of our Prime Minister Goh to Thailand\r\n\r\nin June 1997 and endorsed by the Thai Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP outlines the broad vision of the two countries to\r\n\r\nforge a strategic and economic partnership in which the two\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncountries  could  leverage on, and add  value  to  each  other's\r\n\r\nstrengths and competencies.  As noted by Dr Ong, the second CSEP\r\n\r\nwas  held  in  February 1999 in Bangkok.  In a relatively  short\r\n\r\nperiod,  CSEP has proved to be an important tool to realise  the\r\n\r\nSTEP vision.  Let me just cite two accomplishments:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) the institutionisation of cooperation between the civil\r\n\r\nservices  of  Thailand  and Singapore  which  has  engendered  a\r\n\r\nculture  of consultations and cooperation.  The linkages between\r\n\r\nthe  two civil services will contribute to the development of  a\r\n\r\ngood and mutually beneficial bilateral partnership; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the identification of concrete cooperation projects in many\r\n\r\nareas.   Notable  progress  has  been  made  in  the  fields  of\r\n\r\neducation,    trade    and   investment   promotion,    tourism,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications,  industrial  parks/estates,  and   technical\r\n\r\ncooperation.  An MOU on Cooperation in IT was also signed at the\r\n\r\nsecond meeting of CSEP in Bangkok.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such cooperation between Thailand and Singapore is an\r\n\r\nexcellent  illustration  of  how in times  of  adversity,  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries   can  pull  together  and  press  on  with   regional\r\n\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung also commented on Australia-Singapore\r\n\r\nrelations.  He is right.  The warm and strong relations  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Australia were given impetus by two recent  events\r\n\r\nquoted by him:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) PM Goh made a working visit in early March 1999, just a few\r\n\r\ndays  ago,  where PM Goh had a frank and useful discussion  with\r\n\r\nAustralian Prime Minister Howard and other Australian leaders on\r\n\r\nregional developments; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the Second Singapore-Australia Joint Ministerial Committee\r\n\r\n(SAJMC)  took  place  in Singapore in February  1999.   In  this\r\n\r\nbiennial  SAJMC,  three  Ministers from  each  side  meet  their\r\n\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong asked specifically about the Second SAJMC Meeting.\r\n\r\nIn this recent meeting, both sides reviewed the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprogress  in  our  bilateral relations and  exchanged  views  on\r\n\r\ninternational  issues and on the implications  of  the  regional\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis  and  regional political  developments.   Both\r\n\r\nsides also agreed on several initiatives at the meeting: a G-to-G MOU on IT was concluded between DPM Lee and Australian DPM Tim\r\n\r\nFischer.   Seven  other commercial MOUs/Letters of  Intent  were\r\n\r\nalso  signed.  In addition, both sides also agreed  to  work  on\r\n\r\nestablishing  a  strategic dialogue partnership or  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  think-tank, a Youth Ambassador Exchange  Programme  and\r\n\r\nThird Country Technical Programme courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope and depth of our cooperation with Australia have\r\n\r\nincreased.  Let me cite three areas briefly:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Defence. Defence relations between Singapore and Australia\r\n\r\nare  active and strong.  Australia is an important training area\r\n\r\nfor  our  SAF.  We have also cooperated with Australian  Defence\r\n\r\nForce   in   numerous  bilateral  and  multi-lateral  exercises,\r\n\r\nincluding the FPDA;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Economics. Bilateral economic ties are close. Singapore\r\n\r\nand   Australia   are   top  investors  and  trading   partners.\r\n\r\nSingapore's  total foreign direct investment  in  Australia  for\r\n\r\n1996  was  S$1.82 billion.  Australia's investment in  Singapore\r\n\r\ntotalled  A$1.16  billion as of June 1997.  Bilateral  trade  in\r\n\r\n1998 was S$7.4 billion; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Other areas. The launching of Singapore-Australian\r\n\r\nBusiness  Alliance Forum and Parliamentary Friendship Group  has\r\n\r\nfurther expanded the scope of our bilateral cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's long-term close linkages with Australia will be\r\n\r\nbeneficial  for  the region as well.  Let me cite  two  reasons.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  as Singapore and Australia have weathered the  current\r\n\r\neconomic crisis better, we have been working closely to help the\r\n\r\naffected regional countries.  We have also agreed to have closer\r\n\r\ndialogue and cooperation on international and regional financial\r\n\r\nmanagement and financial reform issues.  Secondly, in view\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  its unique cultural and historical links, Australia could be\r\n\r\nthe  interface between the West and the affected Asian countries\r\n\r\nin  resolving the current financial crisis.  Australia has shown\r\n\r\nits desire to play such a role by being engaged in Indonesia and\r\n\r\nproposing initiatives on international financial reforms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Dr Wang Kai Yuen's comments on Singapore-Hong Kong\r\n\r\nrelations,  let  me  give him an overview.  Singapore-Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nbilateral  relations  are  warm and close.   There  are  regular\r\n\r\nvisits  of  leaders  and officials from both  sides.   Bilateral\r\n\r\ncooperation at officials' level is also progressing  well  under\r\n\r\nthe  Civil  Service Exchange Programme.  The programme comprises\r\n\r\n(i)   exchange   of   visits  between  senior  officials;   (ii)\r\n\r\nattachments  of  civil servants; and (iii) cross appointment  of\r\n\r\nsenior  officials.   There has been a steady  flow  of  incoming\r\n\r\nvisits by senior Hong Kong officials since the handover in  July\r\n\r\n1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliamentary links, in the form of Singapore-Hong Kong\r\n\r\nParliamentary Friendship Group, are consolidated with  exchanges\r\n\r\nof visits from both sides, including the recent visit by Dr Wang\r\n\r\nand six other MPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the bilateral economic relations, it is healthy and\r\n\r\ngood.  Total bilateral trade for 1998 was S$20.2 billion.  Total\r\n\r\nSingapore  investment in Hong Kong for 1995 was  S$6.27  billion\r\n\r\nand  total Hong Kong investment in Singapore at the end of  1994\r\n\r\nwas  S$5.02  billion.  I agree with Dr Wang that  the  so-called\r\n\r\nrivalry and competition between Hong Kong and Singapore is  more\r\n\r\na  perception  rather than real.  However, this  perception  has\r\n\r\nsomewhat affected the bilateral relations between Hong Kong  and\r\n\r\nSingapore.   But  we understand the stressful situation  in  the\r\n\r\nAsian  region  as a whole has fanned the \"absurd\"  media  frenzy\r\n\r\nover the so-called rivalry, which was played up by Hong Kong and\r\n\r\nthe Western media.  Some SAR officials felt obliged to answer to\r\n\r\nqueries  by the legislators and media, which have further  added\r\n\r\nto  the frenzy.  We have reacted calmly and rationally, although\r\n\r\nwe have, at times, come out to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrobustly  clarify  inaccurate and baseless comments  made  about\r\n\r\nSingapore, including the example cited by the Member.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's recent financial liberalisation and cost-cutting measures were designed to make Singapore competitive.\r\n\r\nIn  some cases, we try to keep up with Hong Kong, not \"stamp\" on\r\n\r\nHong  Kong when it is down.  Let me cite the Senior Minister  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech at Tanjong Pagar Chinese New Year gathering,  and  I\r\n\r\nquote,  \"Singapore has learnt from Hong Kong's example  and  was\r\n\r\nliberalising  its financial sector to keep pace with  New  York,\r\n\r\nLondon, Tokyo, Frankfurt and Hong Kong, not to do Hong Kong in.\"\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not a zero sum game. There is a considerable\r\n\r\ndegree  of  cooperation  and  mutual  benefit  from  having  two\r\n\r\nfinancial centres, two prosperous cities in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthy competition in some areas is inevitable, but Hong\r\n\r\nKong  is not Singapore's principal competitor.  We are promoting\r\n\r\nother   sectors   such  as  manufacturing,   petrochemical   and\r\n\r\npharmaceuticals, and services (other than financial services).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang would agree with me that it is in our interest to\r\n\r\nhave a stable and prosperous Hong Kong.  Given the nature of our\r\n\r\nrelationship, Singapore and Hong Kong will always cooperate  and\r\n\r\ncompete  with each other at the same time.  The success  of  one\r\n\r\nwill be a spur to greater success for the other.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, a quick word before Dr Ong moves on\r\n\r\nto his other cuts.  It is not true that we opposed the admission\r\n\r\nof  Cambodia.   In fact, Singapore's position on this  has  been\r\n\r\nboth  consistent and based on principles.  The decision to admit\r\n\r\nCambodia  was  taken some years ago in 1996 by  the  leaders  of\r\n\r\nASEAN.   And  it was really a question of timing  when  Cambodia\r\n\r\nshould take its place in ASEAN.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMembers  are  aware  of the various developments  which  led  to\r\n\r\ninstability  in  Cambodia.  But the formation of  the  coalition\r\n\r\ngovernment  in  November last year was  a  very  important  step\r\n\r\ntowards a move to normalcy in Cambodia.  Unfortunately,  by  the\r\n\r\ntime  the  leaders met in Hanoi for the Summit  and  where  some\r\n\r\nthought Cambodia could be admitted in time for the Hanoi Summit,\r\n\r\nit  was  not  possible to take the decision  because  Singapore,\r\n\r\nThailand and the Philippines noted that the political parties to\r\n\r\nthe  coalition themselves had announced to the world that a  key\r\n\r\ncomponent   of  their  agreement  on  the  coalition   was   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of a Senate.  And by the time we  met  in  Hanoi,\r\n\r\nthat  aspect,  which  they  themselves  had  proclaimed  as   an\r\n\r\nimportant  element,  had  not yet been  given  effect  by  their\r\n\r\nlegislation.  So the position we took was that it was  premature\r\n\r\nto  take  the decision to formally admit them at Hanoi.  Rather,\r\n\r\nwe  should wait for the establishment of the Senate, because  if\r\n\r\nthe  Senate  was  not  established and they  have  already  been\r\n\r\nadmitted, then you can have a situation where the political deal\r\n\r\ncould have become unravelled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to report that last week I received a letter from\r\n\r\nthe  Cambodian Foreign Minister informing me that the  necessary\r\n\r\nsteps  have been taken by the Cambodian National Assembly  which\r\n\r\nhas approved the constitutional amendments for the establishment\r\n\r\nof the Senate.  I have accordingly written to all my colleagues,\r\n\r\nthe  ASEAN Foreign Ministers, as well as to Vietnam, which  will\r\n\r\nbe  the  host for the special admission ceremony, that we should\r\n\r\nproceed to implement the decision of the leaders.  And I  expect\r\n\r\nthat  Vietnam  will consult and settle on a date  soon  for  the\r\n\r\nformal admission ceremony.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, despite all the criticisms, pot\r\n\r\nshots and snide remarks, the United Nations is here to stay.  It\r\n\r\nsimply  could not be wished away.  Neither is there  any  viable\r\n\r\nsubstitute  to  replace  the  United  Nations.   It  has  indeed\r\n\r\nestablished  itself as a world body for all countries,  big  and\r\n\r\nsmall.   It allows small nations like Singapore a forum  on  the\r\n\r\nworld stage.  It is a good place to network, to make\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrepresentation, to air views and to train diplomats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is active at the UN and is bidding for a seat on\r\n\r\nthe  UN  Security Council for the year 2001.  I wish to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for his assessment of Singapore's role at  the  United\r\n\r\nNations; whether Singapore will play an even more active role in\r\n\r\nthe UN Peace-keeping Missions; whether Singapore is on track  in\r\n\r\nour  bid for the Security Council seat; and what are our chances\r\n\r\nof securing such a seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Briefly, Sir. A few days ago, the hon. NCMP,\r\n\r\nMr  Jeyaretnam, suggested that Singapore did not need a  defence\r\n\r\nforce,  and that it could rely on the UN.  The answer by  almost\r\n\r\nall  Members was that this was not possible.  I too concur  that\r\n\r\ndefence by the UN collective security is insufficient.  A first-line defence is always necessary.  May I invite the Minister  to\r\n\r\nshare  his thoughts on what then, if it is not defence,   do  we\r\n\r\nseek  as  a  member of the UN?  Do we seek a layer  of  peaceful\r\n\r\nexistence and cooperation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, on this matter, I am able to speak\r\n\r\nwith  a  little bit of personal experience because,  many  years\r\n\r\nago, I was Singapore's Permanent Representative to the UN.   And\r\n\r\nI can say that if it was true then, it is still true today, that\r\n\r\nas  a  small  country,  Singapore  lacks  the  resources  to  be\r\n\r\nadequately represented by embassies throughout the world.  There\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  limit to the number of embassies we can  establish.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a membership in the UN in the first place provides us\r\n\r\nwith  an opportunity to make contact with the broad spectrum  of\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations'  member countries, many of whom  we  would  not\r\n\r\nnormally be in contact through diplomatic ties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say also that another important benefit is that\r\n\r\nthrough  the UN, we are able to project Singapore and  to  raise\r\n\r\nSingapore's international profile.  Our membership  at  the  UN,\r\n\r\ntogether with our participation in UN-related groupings like the\r\n\r\nNon-Aligned  Movement  and the Group of  77,  also  provides  us\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  develop and maintain  our  links  with  other\r\n\r\ncountries in the developing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworld.    Everybody  knows  that  we  have  limited   resources.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have focused on a limited number of issues in  the\r\n\r\nUN.   We have not taken a blunderbuss approach of staffing every\r\n\r\ncommittee  and sending large delegations, because we  believe  a\r\n\r\nselective approach is one where we will be able to deliver  what\r\n\r\nwe have set out to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that in our own small and modest way we have, over\r\n\r\nthe  years,  developed the reputation of being a responsible  UN\r\n\r\nmember  as well as an efficient and effective one, but obviously\r\n\r\nit  must  be  others who will have to judge us.   We  have  also\r\n\r\nstepped up our involvement in UN activities in areas of interest\r\n\r\nto  us,  but  where we may obtain political mileage  at  minimal\r\n\r\ncost.  For example, peace-keeping which was mentioned, Singapore\r\n\r\nwas,  as of May 1997, one of only seven countries to sign a  MOU\r\n\r\nwith  the  UN  on  standby arrangements, ie, to  have  available\r\n\r\nofficers,  observers or medical personnel and  aircraft  for  UN\r\n\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also add that at the UN meetings, my Ministry\r\n\r\nensures,  as far as possible, we have high-calibre delegates  to\r\n\r\nrepresent Singapore.  In this way, we have played an active  and\r\n\r\nconstructive role at various UN forums such as the  Law  of  the\r\n\r\nSea   Conference  or  the  UN  Conference  on  Environment   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment.  And within the UN itself, Singapore  tries  to  be\r\n\r\nactive  on high profile issues such as the reform of the UN  and\r\n\r\nthe UN Security Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asked about our bid for the UN Security Council\r\n\r\ncandidature,  what  are  our chances like.   One  can  never  be\r\n\r\nabsolutely  sure  but  at this stage, I  would  say  that  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident  that  we have a fairly good chance of being  elected.\r\n\r\nWe   announced  our  candidature  early  in  order  to  give  us\r\n\r\nsufficient time to mount a systematic lobbying campaign.    This\r\n\r\ncampaign is going well and we have received many expressions  of\r\n\r\nsupport from numerous countries in all regional groupings in the\r\n\r\nUN.   As  Members know, Singapore is the only declared candidate\r\n\r\nfor the Asian group seat, and this is an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAsian  group seat in the UN Security Council for the term  2001-2002.    All  the  other  ASEAN  countries  have  given   public\r\n\r\nendorsement of our candidature.  I believe these factors put  us\r\n\r\nin good stead for successful election in the year 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will Singapore's role be in the Security Council? We\r\n\r\nhave  presented  our candidature to the Security Council's  non-permanent  seat  for the 2-year term.  And if elected,  it  will\r\n\r\ngive  us  first-hand  experience of  how  the  Security  Council\r\n\r\noperates.   In many ways, the Security Council is the  heart  of\r\n\r\nthe  UN  system.  It is the only organ in the UN  that  has  the\r\n\r\nauthority  to  take  decisions that are binding  on  all  member\r\n\r\nstates.   Although Singapore has never served  on  the  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  before, we believe and we hope that we will be able  to\r\n\r\nbring  to the Security Council constructive and useful, shall  I\r\n\r\nsay, small state perspective to the Council.  This role that  we\r\n\r\nhave  identified  for ourselves will be particularly  useful  to\r\n\r\nthose  UN members who themselves are small states and share  our\r\n\r\nconcerns and sense of vulnerability.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Very briefly, Sir. Our Prime Minister on\r\n\r\na visit to Chile in October 1998 mentioned the need to establish\r\n\r\na  forum for the academia, business people, Economic and Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters to forge a better understanding between Latin  America\r\n\r\nand  Asia.  The call for a forum was driven by a desire to  know\r\n\r\nmore  about  Latin America, not just the economies  but  people,\r\n\r\nculture  and the environment.  I would like to ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhat  steps  have  been  taken since to promote  the  Asia-Latin\r\n\r\nAmerica Dialogue forum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed): Sir, looking at  the\r\n\r\nclock,  there is no time for samba!  Briefly, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nfirst  raised  the  idea  of the East Asia-Latin  America  forum\r\n\r\n(EALAF) last September.  As we know, we have institutional links\r\n\r\nwith  North  America  through APEC, and with European  countries\r\n\r\nthrough ASEM.  So there is currently\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  missing link between East Asia and Latin America.  In  the\r\n\r\nglobal  economy, such a gap between two dynamic regions must  be\r\n\r\naddressed  in  the  interest of both regions and  thus  we  have\r\n\r\nEALAF.   EALAF  is  envisaged  to be  a  meeting  of  individual\r\n\r\ncountries of East Asia and Latin America, and not as a  regional\r\n\r\ngroup  to  group  meeting.   So interested  countries  can  join\r\n\r\nwhenever  they  are  ready to do so.   Prime  Minister  Goh  has\r\n\r\nsounded  out leaders of ASEAN, China, Japan and Korea  on  EALAF\r\n\r\nand the responses have been generally supportive.  Similarly, we\r\n\r\ngather that the response from the 12 Rio group members has  also\r\n\r\nbeen extremely good.  The plan is actually to hold a SOM meeting\r\n\r\nsometime late this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, do you want to speak on technical\r\n\r\ncooperation very briefly?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I will be brief.

We  still  need,\r\n\r\nparamount of all, as demonstrated in the Second World  War,  our\r\n\r\nown defence, and a very strong SAF.  The UN can be a forum.  The\r\n\r\nUN can be a back-up, but never the front line for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to ask the Minister whether he will tell us\r\n\r\nwhat are the technical cooperation schemes between Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe other countries.
