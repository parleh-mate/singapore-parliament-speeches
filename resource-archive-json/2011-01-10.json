Speaker, may I take Question Nos. 1 and 2 together?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>: Yes.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng referred to the impact of higher inflation on Singaporeans.&nbsp; CPI inflation for November 2010 was 3.8% year-on-year, bringing the average over January to November to 2.7%.&nbsp; It is expected to rise further in the first quarter of this year, before moderating in subsequent quarters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, about half of the \"headline CPI inflation rate\" over the last year has been due to a single factor&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the sharp rise in COE premiums.&nbsp; This CPI increase hence does not mean a similar increase in <p align=\"left\">Column: 1972</p>actual cash outlays by the majority of Singaporeans, as only 3% to 4% of households, or 7% of all car owners, purchased new COEs in 2010.&nbsp; The majority of car owners hold existing COEs.&nbsp; If COE premiums stay high, everyone who purchases a new car or renews a COE will eventually face this higher price.&nbsp; However, the purchases will take place over a period of years.&nbsp; Hence, the impact on cash outlays for households as a whole will be spread out over a few years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excluding the recent increase in COE premiums&nbsp;&ndash; which contributed significantly to the \"headline CPI inflation rate\"&nbsp;&ndash; inflation during January to November 2010 averaged about 1.3%.&nbsp; It was due mainly to increases in prices of various foods and oil-related items in the household consumption basket.&nbsp; These price increases reflected weather-related disruptions in food supply from abroad, increased demand in emerging countries like China, and the uptrend in global oil prices.&nbsp; These external factors will unfortunately continue to impact us and are likely to raise domestic prices further in the coming months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way to help Singaporeans to manage these increases in the costs of living is to grow the economy in a sustainable way and raise our skills, so as to help wages grow.&nbsp; That remains our central strategy.&nbsp; However, for households who are not earning any income from work, including most elderly households, inflation is always a problem.&nbsp; The Government is mindful of the problems these households face, and has provided them with significant assistance over the last year&nbsp;&ndash; in fact exceeding the increase in costs of living they have faced. Take for example a retiree couple, living in a 3-room flat.&nbsp; They would have received a total of $1,200 in benefits last year.&nbsp; This would have exceeded the total increase in costs that such households would have faced as a result of rising food, utilities <p align=\"left\">Column: 1973</p>and other prices.&nbsp; If they were living with children who are low-income earners, the assistance provided by the Government would also be considerably greater, as the household&nbsp;would have received Workfare Income Supplement (WIS).&nbsp; The WIS would have gone to the working child, if he or she had a low income.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach will continue in the upcoming Budget.&nbsp; The Government will take into account the impact of inflation and the needs of low-income and retiree households when considering further transfers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng and Mdm Ho Geok Choo had also asked about the outlook for interest rates and what can be done to help Singaporeans, especially the low-income and elderly, get more returns on their savings.&nbsp; The current low level of interest rates reflects loose global liquidity conditions.&nbsp; We do not make official forecasts of interest rates, but market analysts believe that this low interest rate environment could persist for a while in view of the still weak recovery of the US and other developed economies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, low-income savers in Singapore are in fact less affected by bank deposit rates than our CPF interest rates.&nbsp; Apart from the homes they live in, CPF savings are the main source of retirement funds for low- and middle-income Singaporeans.&nbsp; CPF interest rates are currently significantly higher than bank deposit rates.&nbsp; This is especially so for the first $60,000 of a member&rsquo;s balances, which currently earn an interest rate of 3.5% if the money&nbsp;is in the Ordinary Account, and 5% if it is in&nbsp;the Special, Medisave or Retirement accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp; So 3.5%&nbsp;and 5% in&nbsp;a member's CPF accounts for the first $60,000, which&nbsp;are significantly above bank interest rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Singaporeans who do not have significant spare savings&nbsp;&ndash; which include <p align=\"left\">Column: 1974</p>many of our retirees&nbsp;&ndash; it remains best for them to keep their investments simple and conservative.&nbsp; It has been and remains unwise for them to seek higher returns by investing in high risk assets.&nbsp; As Members know, through the MoneySENSE financial education programme, we have been seeking to help more Singaporeans plan for retirement and invest their spare savings prudently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our capital markets are also developing and offering more investment alternatives.&nbsp; These include instruments that offer better returns than savings deposits but without overly high risk.&nbsp; Retail investors can now participate in Singapore Government Securities (SGS) auctions via ATMs of the three local banks.&nbsp; By the middle of this year, they will also be able to buy and sell SGS on the Singapore Exchange.&nbsp; Well-rated corporate bonds are also becoming more widely available, as high quality borrowers are turning more to the bond market to meet their financing needs.&nbsp; Some of these companies have begun to issue bonds aimed at retail investors, and we can expect this to be a growing trend in coming years.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)</B>: Mr Speaker, according to the latest household expenditure survey, HDB residents spent up to 36% of their household expenditure on food including hawker fare.&nbsp; So any increase in the food prices is felt keenly.&nbsp; Is the Minister aware that in recent weeks, the cost of a cup of coffee has gone up by five&nbsp;cents to 20 cents in some food courts, attributed to global price hikes in sugar and coffee?&nbsp; Is the Minister also aware that the privatisation of hawker centres and coffee shops to large chains has led to higher prices?&nbsp; <I>Nasi padang</I> in some food courts can cost more than five dollars.&nbsp; Can the Minister assure us that food prices remain affordable, especially to people with modest income, and that businesses will <p align=\"left\">Column: 1975</p>not use inflation as an excuse to jack up prices and profiteer?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister spoke about investing prudently.&nbsp; Can the Minister address the trend of banks encouraging people to spend and to incur debts with easy credit and promotions rather than to save and to invest prudently?&nbsp;&nbsp;And does the Minister agree that the surge in the number of credit cards per person and the growth of&nbsp;rollover balances are danger signs that people are being ensnared in the cycle of debt?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp; Sir, food price inflation is a concern.&nbsp; In November, it was already about 1.8% higher than it was a year earlier and it is likely to rise in the coming months for the reasons I mentioned.&nbsp; Several key commodities are seeing prices go up significantly in global markets: sugar, which partly accounts for prices at coffee shops going up, coffee itself, wheat, soy beans and several other commodities.&nbsp; This will impact us.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will take into account all factors when we look at the needs of the poor and the elderly, who tend to spend more of their cash on food items compared to middle- and higher-income households.&nbsp; We will take into account their needs.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not prices are going up too rapidly in response to higher import costs,&nbsp;this is something we always monitor.&nbsp; The Ministry of Trade and Industry has a committee that looks into profiteering.&nbsp; Minister of State Lee Yi Shyan heads it.&nbsp; If the Member finds something unusual happening in her neighbourhood, it is useful to pass on the information.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) keeps looking at how banks go about their marketing strategies for credit cards as well as consumer debt generally, both from the point of view of ensuring proper professional practices and also to  <p align=\"left\">Column: 1976</p> make sure that people are not over-extending themselves.&nbsp; Our rules on credit cards and consumer credit are more conservative than in most countries including those in Asia.&nbsp; We limit consumer credit based on how much income you earn.&nbsp; You cannot borrow on credit cards unless you have a minimum income level.&nbsp; But it is something we are watching closely and if Members notice anything that struck them as especially sharp&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; aggressive marketing practices on the part of banks&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; it is useful to provide some feedback to the MAS and they will take a look.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister three supplementary questions.&nbsp; Would the Minister consider commissioning a survey which would allow policymakers to assess how low interest rates are affecting ordinary households?&nbsp; Has the Government done a survey to see what companies, themselves, are doing to prevent prices from rising too&nbsp;quickly especially businesses engaged in daily consumables and transportation?&nbsp; What can the Government do to help these businesses?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp; There is no harm in having a survey to see if it provides a picture different from what the national statistics show.&nbsp; The Ministry of Trade and Industry is in charge of this,&nbsp; but those of us in Government are familiar with how the Department of Statistics goes about its work.&nbsp; The CPI has integrity.&nbsp; It is a robust process of sampling, every so many years, of the household expenditure basket; and they measure prices constantly.&nbsp; The figure I mentioned earlier&nbsp;&ndash; for instance for food in November, the average household food expenditure for a set basket of items faced prices that were 1.8% higher than a year ago&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; that is correct.&nbsp; We will be able to find individual items that went up much faster &ndash;&nbsp;whether it be cooked food in hawker centres or items of raw food that you are buying from the <p align=\"left\">Column: 1977</p>supermarkets or wet markets.&nbsp; But, on average, it went up by 1.8%.&nbsp; We think it is going to go up further.&nbsp; We are concerned about this and we will be studying this to see how we can help households, particularly the low-income households and the elderly.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

They were particularly concerned about the impact on the poorest countries in Africa and elsewhere.&nbsp; I think in this part of the world, although economic growth is rapid, we are also facing problems of our own&nbsp;&ndash; coming out of high demand in China and some weather-related disruptions.&nbsp; Fortunately, we are not as much&nbsp; a consumer of wheat as we are of rice, but nevertheless there is a certain amount of wheat that goes into the household basket in one way or another, and various other products like sugar and so on.&nbsp; We are concerned about it.&nbsp; As I mentioned, the increase in the average household expenditure basket as a result of CPI increases has not been too <p align=left>Column: 1978<p>significant so far but we are watching it&nbsp; and we think it will go up further.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Budget, we will take all this into account in deciding what assistance we should provide to households, in particular the poor and the elderly.&nbsp;

and (b) what measures and initiatives will be introduced to help stimulate growth.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry)</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last year&rsquo;s GDP growth of almost 15% was exceptional and it is not an appropriate indication of Singapore's long-term growth potential.&nbsp; Rather, it reflects a recovery following two years of below-trend growth, coupled with an extremely large expansion in pharmaceutical output and the opening of the Integrated Resorts.&nbsp; If we take an average of economic growth over the last three years, that is 2008 to 2010, it would come to about 5% per annum, which is more reflective of the economy&rsquo;s underlying potential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s expected growth of 4% to 6% is still above our medium-term growth potential of around 3% to 5% per annum.&nbsp; This healthy rate of growth will support job creation and wage growth in both <p align=left>Column: 1979<p>manufacturing and services industries.There is no need for stimulus measures. If anything, we need to be watchful of over-heating risks and raising inflationary pressures, as the labour market tightens and capacity constraints become more binding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the economy at full employment, the emphasis will be on raising the productivity of our workforce and increasing economic competitiveness over the medium term. The Government has been working with businesses and unions to put in place several initiatives to boost skills and innovation.&nbsp;A good example is the Workfare Training Support scheme, which will pay for up to 95% of course fees and provide training commitment awards for older low-wage workers. NTUC has launched the Inclusive Growth Programme (IGP) to drive productivity improvements.&nbsp;The programme targets to benefit 25,000 low-wage workers over the next two years by helping them acquire new skills to handle higher-value jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will also help to raise corporate capabilities. The National Productivity and Continuing Education Council (NPCEC), chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean&nbsp;and comprising representatives from the unions and the public and private sectors, has endorsed a number of initiatives to raise productivity.&nbsp;One of these is the SME-Productivity Roadmap, a joint initiative by SPRING Singapore and the Singapore Workforce Development Agency. This initiative will help Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) identify weaknesses in their work processes and embark on suitable training courses to increase their productivity. Another example is the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund.

There are also clear laws on the penalties which apply, should there be a breach.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every officer undergoes security clearance before being employed by the public service. He is also informed that access to classified information is granted on a need-to-know basis. He is required to comply with the security requirements spelt out in the Government Instruction Manuals, and to sign the undertaking to safeguard official information under the Official Secrets Act.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Government agencies are also responsible for implementing measures to ensure strict user access control for all systems. For example, only official authorised systems, secured with appropriate encryption and authentication mechanisms, may be used to transmit and store classified information. Agencies are also required to conduct periodic checks and audits to ensure compliance with the security requirements.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Permanent Secretaries of Ministries and Heads of Government Departments and Statutory Boards are responsible not only for ensuring that their officers comply with the security requirements, but also for setting the right tone in their respective organisations.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even with comprehensive measures in place, protection of classified <p align=left>Column: 1983<p> information ultimately depends on each public officer observing the rules.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Government is an e-Government. It cannot function without empowering our public servants and disseminating confidential information to them. The efficient functioning of our Government has to be based on mutual trust and honour, backed up by a clear legal framework. Trust and honour can of course be breached. As the WikiLeaks incident shows, even one officer, in that instance a junior officer in the US Army, can cause significant leak of official data with far-reaching consequences.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should there be any leak, the Government will act firmly. All cases will be investigated. Officers responsible for leakage of data will be charged. Furthermore, the OSA allows prosecution not only of public officers responsible for the leaks, but also anyone else (whether or not a public servant) who receives the information or had any role in the leak. The Government has consistently taken this approach, and has on occasions charged private citizens for their roles in leakage of Government data.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the US, the Shield Bill has been introduced in response to the WikiLeaks disclosure. It seeks to tighten up on leaks and the publication of such leaks. The Shield Bill proposes to apply to all, including non-government employees. Opponents of the Shield Bill argue that while it is illegal for government officials to leak information, it should nevertheless not be unlawful for the media and others to publish such information, that is, too bad if the government cannot prevent the information from leaking in the first place. For example, Professor Stone, a distinguished legal scholar in this field, took that position in an opinion published in the <I>International Herald Tribune</I> on 5th January 2011.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a framework, confidential information will become the object of a<p align=left>Column: 1984<p>cat and mouse game. If some government employee breaches the rules, and gets the information to the private sector, then tough luck to the government! This approach has been justified on the basis that it is in the public interest not to restrict free flow of information.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our approach is totally different. If recipients of official information who are not themselves public servants cannot be prosecuted or prevented from publishing it, it would create an unacceptable situation where people outside the Government would have every incentive to obtain confidential information from public servants in every way possible. And public servants would constantly be weighing the benefits to themselves of releasing the confidential information against the likelihood of getting caught and punished.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the broader public interest will suffer.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that everyone involved in a leak of information, whether in Government or outside, should be dealt with firmly. We do not intend to encourage cat and mouse games. Public interest in free flow of information cannot justify the abuse of confidential information.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some countries have allowed their secrecy rules to be weakened in the belief that it is supposedly in the interest of freedom of information. We do not subscribe to such a belief. We fully intend to uphold confidentiality of official information, so that the Government can function properly. It is impossible to conduct diplomacy, develop policy or negotiate issues if everything said or written in the process will become public because officials will no longer commit their true thoughts and reasons in writing for fear of leaks. The end result, ironically, would be less transparency and less accountability.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah):</B> Thank you for the Minister's reply.

That organisation looks at the entire Government sector, constantly reviewing the procedures and reminding officers and all Government public servants on the importance of safeguarding information. But, ultimately, we do not take anything for granted. The way that the leaks happened has meant that there has been continuing review after that as well.

It is not even first-hand, and the original leaks have not been released.&nbsp; So I think it is not wise for us to go into details; then, people will ask: did you say this, did you say that?&nbsp; And if we allow such a train of questioning, then eventually everything comes out.&nbsp; Now the US government is not going to comment on the accuracy, or the veracity or the basis for all these despatches, and that is our policy too.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So to the first question, following my telephone conversation with Dato' Seri&nbsp; Anifah, there have been no further demarches on this subject.&nbsp; If there are, certainly we would respond accordingly.&nbsp; Whether we would take the matter up with the US government; well, we would not, based on the same principle which I stated earlier.&nbsp; Will it affect communications with US diplomats?&nbsp; I think inevitably, because if this happened once, it can happen again, and I think we have got to be more careful.&nbsp; But at the same time, I would say, with the miniaturisation of microphones and cameras, I think we have got to be more careful in any case, whatever we express in confidence to other people.&nbsp; Mind you, something is lost.&nbsp; Part of the intimacy of communication is that we must be able, sometimes without all the evidence in support, to express our deep fears, concerns and hopes.&nbsp; In the nature of statecraft, in the nature of diplomacy, we construct scenarios in our minds, some quite dark ones.&nbsp; And with friends, with people whom we have intimate communication, we share some of these scenarios.&nbsp; Now, we cannot prove these scenarios, or prove some of these speculations in any rigorous way. But, these are based upon instincts or information that we pick up from here and there. So, yes, we have to be more guarded in our communication with US diplomats.&nbsp; I think the WikiLeaks disclosures have been disastrous for US diplomacy. But, this applies to other forms of communication as well.&nbsp; At the same <p align=left>Column: 1989<p>time, it is a loss because I think part of human relationships is that we must be able to share more when we trust somebody more.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I visited a software company just a few days ago and I was told that they are now able to imitate you&nbsp;&ndash; your accent, your manner of expression&nbsp;&ndash; so that you press a button and the same words can be spoken in a different accent, as if somebody else was speaking those words.&nbsp; You are not quite sure now, even if you record a conversation, even if you see a video, what to believe or what not to believe.&nbsp; This is a new challenge posed by technology&nbsp; and I think all of us, including in international diplomacy, are responding to this really profound revolution in technology and trying to understand what it means for human communication and relationships.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:RECENT INCREASE IN COE PRICES--><p align=left>Column: 1989<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:RECENT INCREASE IN COE PRICES:::1993--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>RECENT INCREASE IN COE PRICES</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. &nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak</B> asked the Minister for Transport in view of the recent hike in the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) prices (a) whether there is any evidence&nbsp;of&nbsp; speculation;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; what&nbsp; measures,&nbsp; if&nbsp; any, are&nbsp; being&nbsp; taken&nbsp; to control the sudden surge in COE prices; and (c) what is the expected trend of COE supply over the next 12 months.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Transport (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Transport (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</B>&nbsp; Sir, the COE system has been modified many times to curb speculation and increase its transparency since its introduction in 1990. Let me explain why speculation, or attempts to profiteer from the COE system, is not likely to be significant with the existing measures in place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, all COE bids made in the two car categories (Categories A and B) and the motorcycle category (Category D) must be made in the name of the buyers. <p align=left>Column: 1990<p>Once the COE is obtained, the vehicle has to be registered in the name of the bidder.&nbsp; Therefore, there must be a genuine buyer behind each bid, and the buyer cannot subsequently re-sell the COE to another buyer to profit from a rising COE market. In fact, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has made the rules so tight that cars registered using Categories A and B COEs cannot be transferred within the first three months, and should the ownership of the car be transferred between the 4th and the 6th months, LTA would impose an additional levy to prevent any possible gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to provide some flexibility and convenience for those who require their vehicles urgently, successful COE bids in Category C (Goods Vehicles and Buses) and Category E (Open Category) in the name of individuals are transferable. However, these can only be transferred once within the first three months, while successful bids by companies are not transferable at all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To discourage speculators, especially for the Category E COEs, we have put in place a number of deterrent measures. In the past, there were instances of speculators with Category E COEs who, when caught in a falling COE market, limited their losses by using these COEs to register cheaper vehicles such as motorcycles and immediately de-register them to claim a near 100% COE rebate. To close this loophole, the COE rebate for vehicles registered using a Category E COE is now computed based on the lower of the Category E COE price or that of the corresponding vehicle category in the same tender exercise, and any pro-rated COE rebate is also subject to an 80% cap if the vehicle is de-registered for export within two years from registration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these measures do not make it completely impossible to speculate in Category E COEs, we must also bear in mind that any would-be speculator must<p align=left>Column: 1991<p>be prepared to fork out $10,000 for the COE bid deposit. They would then have at most three months of the COE validity period to try to sell off the COE for a profit, failing which they would lose the $10,000 deposit. The full details of the existing anti-speculation measures can be found at the LTA website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lim asked if any measures will be taken to control the surge in COE prices. The objective of the COE system is to ensure that the vehicle population grows at a sustainable rate so that our roads do not become gridlocked. The supply of COEs is fixed by the quota which takes into account the allowable vehicle growth rate, the actual vehicle de-registrations in the preceding period and the one-time adjustments to compensate for over-projections in de-registrations in 2008 and 2009 under the old methodology. The quota is subsequently distributed through a bidding system, and the prices for the COEs are ultimately determined by the supply of COEs, and the demand for them. In 2010, the supply of COEs was reduced due to the relatively lower de-registrations and the adjustments. This reduction in supply, together with the rising demand for COEs in a strong economy, naturally pushed prices up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has carefully studied the many suggestions given by the public and motor industry recently. In particular, the Motor Traders' Association (MTA) suggested spreading out the adjustments for the over-projections over a longer period. LTA is prepared to do so, to give the industry and car buyers more time to adjust. These are one-time corrections, and will not affect the long-term growth in the vehicle population. LTA will therefore spread out the remaining 9,577 COEs to be corrected over a period of three years, instead of the remaining one year. This will be factored into the quotas for the bidding period of February 2011 to July 2011, which LTA will announce later today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1992<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lim asked about the expected trend of COE supply in the next 12 months. The LTA no longer forecasts future COE supply. However, it has been providing updated information on the latest monthly de-registration data to help those who wish to make their own projections.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply.&nbsp; I have two supplementary questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the gyration of the COE prices.&nbsp; There are years where more than 100,000 COEs are released, and there are years where fewer than 50,000 COEs are released.&nbsp; Over the 10-year life cycle period, I would like to ask the Minister how does his Ministry intend to even out this sudden surge&nbsp;and sudden drop in COE supply, because this will result in the gyration of prices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, regarding some of the suggestions that were given by the public. Will the Ministry consider each COE as a separate bidding, which means that you pay as you bid?&nbsp; That will actually control some of the elements whereby people will tend to outbid one another.&nbsp; The&nbsp;other point is to limit COE financing so&nbsp;as to encourage prudence in car financing.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat</B>:&nbsp; Sir, as explained earlier, the COE policy is to control the vehicle population growth rate.&nbsp; This is to prevent, as I said, gridlock on our roads.&nbsp; It is not a policy which seeks&nbsp;to stabilise COE prices.&nbsp; We do not really control that because the bulk of the supply comes from de-registration.&nbsp; So, it really depends on Singaporeans' decisions on whether&nbsp;to de-register their cars or not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second question raised, which is a suggestion on pay-as-you-bid, the GPC for Transport discussed this some years back.&nbsp; It was a suggestion which they looked into in great detail and they <p align=left>Column: 1993<p>came to the conclusion that there were certain shortcomings in the system.&nbsp; It would add complexity to the system, in particular when you have one particular model with multiple values on it, depending on what you bid for the COE, because different bidders will pay different COE prices.&nbsp;&nbsp; What was important was that they studied the spread of prices.&nbsp; Right now, we have the lowest successful bid which clears the COE quota.&nbsp; When they looked at the spread, they found that&nbsp;there was a clustering towards&nbsp;the lowest successful bid, about 20%-30% above it.&nbsp; LTA looked at it again, and again the clustering was there.&nbsp; It was not as though the highest bidders were pulling up all the prices.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's&nbsp;final question was on COE financing.&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS has looked into this, and&nbsp;studied this.&nbsp; There is no evidence that existing car loan financing rules that are in place pose a systemic threat to the financial system.&nbsp; The non-performing loan is extremely small.&nbsp; So MAS, at this stage, will not be acting to change the car financing rules but expects financial institutions to, of course, exercise prudence when granting car loans.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Of these, 51 or 70% were deliberate, with passengers going onto the tracks to retrieve dropped items, or crossing the tracks as a shortcut.&nbsp; The remaining 22 cases or 30% were accidental, typically involving commuters that fall onto the track due to some illness.&nbsp; In the same period, there were&nbsp;two accidents involving service staff on train tracks.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety procedures are put in place to ensure safety for all rail commuters and service staff.&nbsp; Works on tracks and guideways are governed by track access procedures and safety procedures to ensure work safety for staff.&nbsp; Areas that are safe for access are clearly demarcated.&nbsp; Should there be a need for service staff to encroach into areas outside of these boundaries, the train Operation and Control Centre (OCC) will hold all trains stationary before the access is authorised.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For commuters on the station platforms, the operators regularly broadcast safety reminders for passengers to wait behind the yellow lines on the platforms, and station Customer Service Officers (CSOs) at platforms to ensure that passengers do not rush onto the trains.&nbsp; Train drivers are also trained to keep a lookout for potentially dangerous situations and to take preventive actions when necessary.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of these measures, accidents sometimes occur.&nbsp; We view these incidents seriously, and require the operators to submit reports identifying the causes of the incident and the safety mitigation actions to avoid similar occurrences in the future.</p><p align=left>Column: 1995<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Member Mr Zaqy Mohamad has highlighted, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is also in the process of installing Half Height Platform Screen Doors (HHPSD) at all 36 elevated MRT stations of the North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL).&nbsp; The installations are targeted for completion by 2012.&nbsp; To date, the platform screen doors are operational at&nbsp;nine MRT stations: Pasir Ris, Yishun, Jurong East, Clementi, Bukit Gombak, Lakeside, Bukit Batok, Chinese Garden and Eunos.&nbsp; More are on the way very soon.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrying out platform screen door installations on an operational MRT Line is a challenging task.&nbsp; Installation work can only commence after revenue service hours, so that daily train operations are not affected.&nbsp; Works are therefore limited to a narrow window of about two-three hours each night.&nbsp; We seek the public's patience and understanding on this, and remain committed to completing the installation of the platform screen doors as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has prioritised the installation works by targeting more crowded MRT stations such as Jurong East, Clementi and Yishun.&nbsp; Priority was also given to the East-West Line as it has more elevated stations than the North-South Line.&nbsp; We expect work on the East-West Line stations to be completed by the third quarter of this year.&nbsp;

and&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;what recourse and protection do employers have against maid agencies that flout this requirement.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Lee Yi Shyan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Lee Yi Shyan) (for the Minister for Manpower</B>):&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, on 1st January 2005, MOM raised the minimum age of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) from 18 to 23 years, as older FDWs are generally more responsible, and are better able to take care of themselves and adapt to the working environment in a foreign country.&nbsp; MOM's studies have shown that FDWs above the age of 23 are more likely to settle in well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, the number of unnatural deaths involving FDWs has fallen from an annual average of 30 for 2002 to 2005, to an annual average of 20 from 2006 to 2010.&nbsp; The annual number of reported abuse cases has also fallen by more than 20%, from 217 cases in 2001 to 167 in 2009.&nbsp; This is despite an increase in the FDW population by almost a third since 2005.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to hold an employment agency licence, employment agencies are required to ensure that the workers they bring in meet MOM's entry requirements.&nbsp; As the first point of contact for FDWs, and the intermediary between FDWs and employers, employment agencies are expected to exercise due diligence in verifying the age of FDWs.&nbsp; This includes checking the details in their official documents such as their passports, birth documents and educational certificates, as well as interviewing FDWs to ensure that the information they provide at the interviews is consistent with the information in their official documents.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM actively investigates and takes action against negligent employment agencies that fail to meet these <p align=left>Column: 1997<p>requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 14 employment agencies were warned for bringing in under-aged FDWs, of which four were issued demerit points as well.&nbsp; Action taken against some of these agencies stemmed from information provided by the under-aged FDWs themselves, who were not prosecuted.&nbsp; The new employment agency regulatory framework that MOM hopes to implement on 1st April&nbsp;this year&nbsp;aims to further tighten regulations on errant employment agencies, and raise the professionalism and service standards of the employment agency industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, staff at MOM's Work Pass Services Centre interview FDWs who appear especially young to verify their application details when they arrive for fingerprinting.&nbsp; FDWs found to be under-aged will not be allowed to work here.&nbsp; However, as the passport is an official document issued by the source country authorities, it is the primary document for identification and age verification.&nbsp; It is therefore important for these authorities in the source countries to ensure that the information contained in such documents is accurate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reducing the minimum age requirement will not address the problems faced by young FDWs.&nbsp; Lowering the minimum age requirement to 21 may even lead to the perverse outcome of making it easier for even younger girls to circumvent the minimum age requirement.&nbsp; MOM will continue to step up its surveillance and enforcement efforts.&nbsp; The authorities in the source countries also need to do their part to regulate their employment agencies and ensure the accuracy of information in their official documents.&nbsp; We will work with embassies to encourage accuracy in official documents and enforcement against errant employment agencies in source countries.&nbsp; Employers and other members of the public can also help by<p align=left>Column: 1998<p>informing MOM if they suspect that an FDW in Singapore may be under-aged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B> &nbsp; Two supplementary questions for the Minister of State.&nbsp; First,&nbsp;on reducing the age from 23 years to 21 years and the argument of the Minister of State that this will result in even younger FDWs being brought in. But as it is, we already have those as young as 16 years old being brought in.&nbsp; I do not see the correlation in reducing the age from 23 to 21 and therefore having even younger foreign domestic workers being brought in, but at least the supply of the foreign domestic workers can be increased if the age limit is brought down to 21 years, without compromising the safety and welfare of these domestic workers.&nbsp; My second point is, as the Minister of State has said, the official travel document is the source of information and how can we ensure that employment agencies will bring in maids who are not under-aged because that is the same argument that they are using in citing the fact that they be made responsible for under-aged domestic maids to be brought into Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lee Yi Shyan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lee Yi Shyan</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I thank the Member for raising the two clarifications.&nbsp; I think it is common logic to say that if the requirement age is 23 years,&nbsp; to judge whether someone is under-aged against 23 years will be easier than to judge against&nbsp;21 years, for the same under-aged worker that one intends to bring in.&nbsp; Already today, given that this is the requirement, many employment agencies and potential employers cannot really tell the difference&nbsp;in age if the under-aged person is not far from the requirement age.&nbsp; Therefore, we do not see how by reducing the age&nbsp;from 23 years to 21 years can help in detecting under-aged FDWs.&nbsp; Our past data also suggested that many FDWs who had a great deal of adjustment problems were FDWs of age 23 years and below.&nbsp; In fact, a number of them who&nbsp;fell to death from heights were<p align=left>Column: 1999<p>around that age band.&nbsp;&nbsp;So cutting the requirement age at 23 years was a deliberate move in 2005, and I think we should stick to that.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member also&nbsp;raised a supply issue.&nbsp; We do not think supply is an issue at this point.&nbsp; I think quality of supply is what we should pay attention to.&nbsp; In fact, for FDWs who want to work in Singapore, we have introduced a number of measures, including requiring them to take a basic test to show their literacy and numeracy skills, and their ability&nbsp;to understand basic instructions on safety.&nbsp; Also, we require first-time FDWs&nbsp;to take a four-hour orientation programme to be aware of their rights and to understand safety precautions surrounding their work environment.&nbsp; So these are additional measures that we have introduced to help first-time FDWs&nbsp;adjust to the Singapore environment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to employment agencies saying they are relying on official documents as proof of age, we know that the source document is very important.&nbsp; We are working with foreign embassies to ensure that the source document can be verified.&nbsp; However, we also want our employment agencies to go beyond just relying on documentary proof,&nbsp;and to conduct investigative interviews upfront so that through interviews, we can find out if the workers have the right experience, if they indeed have finished school,&nbsp;if they indeed have worked for a number of years, and whether the evidence presented&nbsp;by them is contradictory.&nbsp; So we have to rely on a number of measures to make sure that the under-aged workers do not come in.&nbsp; Over the last few years, we have repatriated about 50 FDWs each year because they were underage.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But the issue of supply, in my view, has a direct correlation to the domestic workers being brought in&nbsp;who are under-aged.&nbsp; Could the Minister of State still consider that possibility?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lee Yi Shyan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lee Yi Shyan</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I agree with Mdm Halimah's point that the qualitative aspect&nbsp;and the maturity of the FDW to be brought in&nbsp;are our ultimate concerns.&nbsp; Given that many of these workers do not grow up in our kind of urban environment and are not necessarily exposed to the requirements of modernity, some of them really have problems just operating washing machines, microwaves, and so on, not to mention working in high-rise buildings and cleaning windows.&nbsp; This is a very different environment from where they came from.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Because we have a system where we allow them to sell their flats in the open market, the impact&nbsp;is that some of them&nbsp;make decisions with a lot of repercussions down the road.&nbsp; We want to encourage Singaporeans to be a little bit more prudent when they make decisions on selling their flats.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;trajectory really is for them to have their flats, upgrade to a bigger flat if they can afford it, because their children have grown bigger and subsequently use the flat to monetise when they grow older.&nbsp; It is not about speculation, it is not about churning&nbsp;cash through the sale of the flats.&nbsp; I hope Singaporeans will be able to understand that trajectory so that we will be able to ensure that Singaporeans continue to be home owners and at the same time take advantage of their flats when they increase in value and to monetise them when they grow older.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:RENTING OUT OF HDB FLATS BY OWNERS--><p align=left>Column: 2004<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:RENTING OUT OF HDB FLATS BY OWNERS:::2006--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</B> Sir, there are several measures that HDB has put in place to ensure that disamenities arising from subletting of flats are reduced.&nbsp; First, HDB requires owners to seek HDB's approval prior to subletting and there are certain conditions for approval and there are certain groups of people or sub-tenants who are allowed to sublet the flats.&nbsp; Secondly, the approval to sublet&nbsp;is given for&nbsp;a maximum of three years, subject to subsequent extension and renewal.&nbsp; Therefore, HDB will continue to monitor those cases that had been approved.&nbsp; Thirdly, there&nbsp;are&nbsp;half-yearly inspections&nbsp; conducted by HDB and HDB continues to conduct these inspections,&nbsp; over and above the feedback given by the residents.&nbsp; What is important really is a combination of both HDB's ongoing inspections on the approved cases as well as the feedback that are given by the members of the public.&nbsp; We encourage the members of the public and the grassroots organisations to continue to work with the branch offices, and the branch offices will certainly inspect every feedback that is given by the members of the public to ensure that the lessees do not violate any of the sub tenancy rules.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SCREENING CRITERIA FOR TRAINEE TEACHERS AND TEACHING SCHOLARSHIPS--><p align=left>Column: 2006<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:SCREENING CRITERIA FOR TRAINEE TEACHERS AND TEACHING SCHOLARSHIPS:::2010--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That is the overall aspect.&nbsp; At the same time, I think we would have to give the schools the judgement when they write the testimonials: do we want them to write every misdemeanour?&nbsp; When do you think that&nbsp;someone has learned a lesson as a 12-year-old, a 13-year-old or a 14-year-old and to be put on record?&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me thank&nbsp;Mr Arthur Fong for his question on the postal delivery service.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) actively monitors the level of customer satisfaction with the postal delivery service and,&nbsp;indeed, we have observed an increase in the number of complaints in the second half&nbsp;of last year.&nbsp; These complaints relate to both mail and parcel delivery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basic mail delivery service is licensed.&nbsp; As a Public Postal Licensee,&nbsp;SingPost is required to comply with the Quality of Service (QoS) standards set by IDA for <p align=left>Column: 2011<p>the delivery of ordinary mail.&nbsp; Ordinary mail&nbsp;is defined as basic letters that weigh up to 500 grams.&nbsp; The QoS standards require 99% and 98% of local ordinary mail posted before stipulated collection times, to be delivered by the next working day for destinations within and outside the Central Business District (CBD) respectively.&nbsp; So, 99% for destinations within the CBD by the next working day and 98% for mail collected to be delivered by the next working day for those outside the CBD and, of course, for both areas 100% of the mail to be delivered by the second working day.&nbsp; There are also other QoS standards for the local processing of foreign ordinary mail.&nbsp; All QoS standards are measured monthly and reviewed on a quarterly basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SingPost has&nbsp;been complying with the QoS standards, including after the implementation of the five-day mail collection and delivery service implemented in May 2010.&nbsp; While there had been 108 complaints to IDA, SingPost and the media on late or lost ordinary mail between July and December of last year, it should be taken into perspective that SingPost delivers more than 60 million mail items on a monthly basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parcel delivery does not require a licence from IDA.&nbsp; The parcel delivery market is fully liberalised and is a competitive one with many service providers besides SingPost, including both local and foreign operators, such as Federal Express, United Parcel Services, DHL, TNT, Swiss Post, Royal Mail, Deutsche Post and Sweden Post.&nbsp; With the availability of competitive options for consumers, IDA believes that market forces will compel operators to provide high quality parcel delivery services to consumers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the increase in the number of complaints in the second half of last year, IDA had asked SingPost to review <p align=left>Column: 2012<p>its delivery processes.&nbsp; SingPost has identified two key causes for the recent service lapses: firstly, a higher-than-usual attrition rate in postal staff, and secondly, a substantial increase in overall parcel volume in the second half of last year.&nbsp; SingPost has publicly acknowledged these issues and shared their measures for improvements.&nbsp; These include stepping up the recruitment of postmen and postal workers as well as conducting additional and more stringent quality checks to minimise sorting errors and mis-deliveries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet increasing consumer needs and expectations, SingPost has also informed IDA that it will implement several improvements to its delivery and operational procedures, such as re-designing the work processes at delivery bases, improving the workflow for handling mis-sorted mail, and increasing the number of collection trips, just to name a few of them.&nbsp; IDA is also reviewing the QoS standards imposed on SingPost and enhancing audits on its delivery service.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also understand that the public has been concerned whether SingPost&rsquo;s move to a five-day mail collection and delivery service has impacted postal service quality.&nbsp; A five-day mail service is not uncommon globally.&nbsp; More than 70 countries have implemented a five-day mail service, including countries such as Australia, Canada, Sweden and Malaysia, just to name a few.&nbsp; This was a result of declining mail volumes and changing mailing habits, driven by the increased use of alternative forms of communication like email and SMS, and the trend of more companies adopting a five-day work week.&nbsp; The five-day mail service has in fact served to optimise postal resources and provide a more family-friendly work week for postmen working in this physically demanding industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure this House that IDA will continue to ensure that SingPost<p align=left>Column: 2013<p>improves its delivery processes so that the public&rsquo;s postal needs are met.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Once again, let me say that based on the standards that we have established today, SingPost meets them fully and the number of complaints, I would have to say, are actually relatively small compared to the volume of mail that SingPost has to handle, which is about 60 million mail items on a monthly basis.</div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Allied Health Professions Bill establishes a regulatory body, the Allied Health Professions Council, to register and regulate the allied health professionals, and prohibits false representation of these professionals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Allied Health Professions comprise diverse groups of healthcare professionals providing a wide range of health services. <p align=left>Column: 2015<p>They include radiographers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, speech therapists, and many others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a rapidly ageing population, demand for healthcare will rise as the sick elderly are more likely to present with many diseases and more complex conditions. We are reforming our healthcare system to cope with the challenges in two major areas. First, we are strengthening the community and step-down care sector so that patients can be treated there competently instead of in costly acute hospitals. Second, doctors will increasingly be assisted by multi-disciplinary healthcare teams with allied health professionals as key partners. Success of these reforms relies on well-trained allied health professionals.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These health professionals, with their specialised know-how, can contribute to better health outcomes and lower healthcare costs through effective rehabilitation, health promotion and prevention. For example, a physiotherapist is skilled in the physical rehabilitation of stroke patients or those who had undergone hip replacement, helping them to walk again. An occupational therapist is best placed to train the patient to perform self-care activities safely and independently, such as dressing himself, toileting and bathing. These rehabilitative activities are essential in helping the elderly regain an active and meaningful life.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, we have left the allied health professions to regulate themselves. This was somewhat adequate in the past as most of them worked in the public sector and the professional bodies had diligently taken on a voluntary regulatory role.&nbsp; However, as the demand for their services grows and as we try to build up the long-term care sector, the voluntary approach to regulation will become less effective. Voluntary self-regulation is also <p align=left>Column: 2016<p>not the international norm.&nbsp; All developed countries have legislations to regulate their allied health professions and they have been doing so for years.&nbsp; Singapore is an outlier.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I signalled this intent to regulate the allied health professions in 2007 when I came to this House to move the Optometrists and Opticians Bill.&nbsp; The experience to regulate the optometrists and opticians has been positive. We are now better assured that these eye-care practitioners have the competencies to provide safe and effective eye-care services. Since then, the Optometrists and Opticians Board has registered more than 2,300 optometrists and opticians and will be implementing mandatory continuing professional education. This is a significant improvement from the past where untrained persons could easily set up shop and provide optometry services with sometimes questionable standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Our approach to regulation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next major group are the therapy professions: physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists. MOH could establish another legislation to target this group but there are many more allied health professions, like the dietitians, radiographers and psychologists. Such a piecemeal approach will take a long time.&nbsp; Instead, we recommend the more efficient option of an umbrella legislation that will allow for the regulation of many allied health groups, with subsidiary legislations covering individual professions. The United Kingdom, New Zealand and Hong Kong have taken such an approach and this is the approach which is incorporated in this Bill. Let me now elaborate on the key features.<br>&nbsp;<br><I>Main features of Bill<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part I lays out the scope of application for the Bill where clause 4 clarifies that<p align=left>Column: 2017<p>the Bill applies only to Allied Health Professions listed in the Second Schedule. As a start, only the occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech therapists will be regulated. Clause 5 empowers the Minister for Health to amend the Schedule to regulate other allied health professions in future.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part II of the Bill sets up the Allied Health Professions Council, provides for members of the Council to be appointed by the Minister for Health, and to include representatives from each of the regulated allied health professions. The Council's functions are set out in clause 7, and include registration, issuing of practising certificates, and setting of standards for training, conduct and practice.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been concerns raised regarding adequate representation of the different professions and the effectiveness of a single regulator regulating many different professions. Clause 12 empowers the Council to appoint committees and professional boards. These committees and professional boards play a key role in advising and making recommendations to the Council with regard to the standards and issues arising in particular professions, and will comprise mainly members of the specific professions. Coupled with a representative Council, such a structure would ensure that each profession is adequately represented and the unique issues faced by specific professions can be addressed. However, for operational efficiency, the Council is expected to maintain oversight and management of the committees and boards, complaints, investigations and disciplinary processes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part III of the Bill sets out the registration framework to recognise appropriately trained and qualified professionals for practice in Singapore, <p align=left>Column: 2018<p>and empowers the Council to impose conditions and restrictions on registration, require mandatory continuing education, refuse registration, remove and restore names under specified circumstances. Clause 14 sets up the four registers, corresponding to the four types of registration and these are: Full, Restricted, Conditional, and Temporary registration.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 16 to 19 set out the general criteria, conditions and restrictions that may be imposed in the four registration categories. The tiered registration framework enables the Council flexibility to register individuals according to their training and practice experience, whilst providing safeguards to protect the public.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now elaborate on the different tiers of registration.&nbsp; An allied health professional with full registration may practise generally and without supervision in the profession in which he is registered. There will be a list of approved qualifications. These qualifications will be determined by the Council and established for each regulated profession in the regulations. Anyone who holds an approved qualification or passes the local qualifying examination in a regulated profession would be eligible for full registration.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 16 deals with full registration and requires an allied health professional to complete a period of supervised practice under conditional registration before being eligible for full registration. This allows the Council to make a more comprehensive assessment of the practitioner instead of relying only on his qualifications and credentials. Clause 16 also allows the Council to apply exceptions and give full registration directly to an individual who is clearly well-trained and competent. Where a person is not eligible for full registration, his application will be assessed for other registration categories.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 2019<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 17 deals with restricted registration. A practitioner who does not have an approved qualification but has been practising in Singapore; or who may have a post-graduate qualification in specific area of professional practice but does not have an approved basic qualification,&nbsp;is among those who will be eligible for restricted registration. Like full registration, an allied health professional on restricted registration can practise independently. However, restrictions are imposed on his scope, place of practice, or employment because of his qualifications, practice experience, or health issues. Before an individual is granted restricted registration, his abilities may also have to be assessed through conditional registration.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 18 deals with conditional registration. Conditional registration will generally be applied to all new registrants who have approved qualifications or have passed the local qualifying examinations. While under conditional registration, the practitioner will be supervised and subject to performance review. This enables the Council to make an assessment on the ability to practise safely and competently. The supervision requirement also ensures that new practitioners are adequately supported when they start working in Singapore.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Temporary registration is set out in clause 19 and applies to an allied health professional who is in Singapore for the purpose of teaching, research or postgraduate study; or deemed to have knowledge, experience and skill of value to Singapore to function in any healthcare capacity, including the provision of health services, but is not otherwise entitled to be registered. To safeguard the public, a practitioner on temporary registration will require supervision at all times, and additional conditions and restrictions may also be imposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part IV of the Bill sets out the various offences and a penalty of a fine not<p align=left>Column: 2020<p>exceeding $25,000 and/or prison term not exceeding six months for a first offence. This Part protects the public by prohibiting false representation of the regulated allied health professionals. There are inherent difficulties in regulating every aspect of practice in any profession as, naturally, overlaps occur in normal life and work. For example, both exercise trainers and physiotherapists prescribe exercises but for different purposes and to different types of clients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we recognise that allied health professionals are trained and qualified to deal with healthcare and patients, and the expectation from the public is with regard to such expertise and its expected treatment outcomes. With a register of such professionals and laws against false representation, patients are assured that they are receiving treatment from <I>bona fide</I> practitioners.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, clauses 29 and 30 make it an offence for a person who is not registered to imply that he is a qualified professional from the way he provides services, or use any title set out in the Second Schedule. Clauses 31 to 33 set out various offences to prohibit business owners and employers from making false claims that their employee is so qualified, and also holds the employee and his co-workers liable for such false claims.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part V of the Bill deals with disciplinary proceedings before a Complaints&nbsp; Committee, Disciplinary Tribunal, Health Committee and interim orders committee inquiries. It provides for the Council to take action against the registered allied health professional on conduct and fitness to practise issues set out in clause 39, and also has in place appeals mechanisms for aggrieved parties. The clauses in this Part are substantially similar to the new Part VII of the Medical Registration Act.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To support professional self regulation, the Complaints Committee and Disciplinary <p align=left>Column: 2021<p> Tribunal set out in clauses 40 and 50 will have a majority of members from the profession register index in the same profession as the person being complained against. As some of the smaller professions may not have members of sufficient experience and expertise, clause 50 also provides for the Minister to make exceptions to the Disciplinary Tribunal members' appointment where it is expedient to do so. Senior legal professionals may also be appointed to the Tribunal.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Complaints Committee and Disciplinary Tribunal are empowered to make a wide range of orders to deal with matters. These include dismissing frivolous complaints; issuing letters of advice or warning; ordering the registered person to undergo treatment, or suspending his practice. These powers are set out in clauses 42, 49 and 53. In addition, the Disciplinary Tribunal is empowered to impose a penalty of up to $50,000 on a registrant.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part VI provides for miscellaneous clauses to support the Council in meeting its mandate, such as setting out the powers of the investigators, appointment of legal and medical assessors and allowing for composition of offences.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, the First Schedule sets out the occupational groups defined as allied health professions, and the Second Schedule lists and describes the allied health professions to which the Bill applies to.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In preparing this Bill, the Ministry has consulted the public, allied health professionals and their associations as well as employers. There is strong support for the Bill. We will continue to consult them as we refine the implementation plans and subsidiary legislation that will follow.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 2022<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, we need highly-skilled allied health professionals to beef up our healthcare teams so that Singaporeans can continue to enjoy a high level of health even as they grow old.&nbsp; Our allied health professionals have rendered a high level of care despite not being regulated.&nbsp; However, going forward, my Ministry believes that the allied health professionals can play an even larger and more effective role through statutory regulation as prescribed in this Bill. This will be good for the professions which have unanimously supported this Bill and this will be good for patients who can then be assured of competent and safe services. I seek the House's strong support for this Bill to ensure that the public continues to enjoy high standards of healthcare.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.15 pm </p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Allied Health Professions Bill. <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill is introduced at an appropriate time when the roles of allied health professionals become more important with the changing healthcare landscape in Singapore.&nbsp; The rapidly ageing population and the increased prevalence of chronic diseases will inevitably lead to an increase in demand for allied health services.&nbsp; This change will necessitate regulation of the industry to ensure a high standard of service delivery.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allied health professionals are clinical healthcare professionals distinct from doctors, nurses and dentists.&nbsp; They work hand-in-hand with medical professionals by providing a range of diagnostic, technical, therapeutic and support services to patients.&nbsp; Singapore currently faces a shortage of allied health<p align=left>Column: 2023<p>professionals.&nbsp; For example, there are currently about 800 physiotherapists in Singapore and this figure on a per population basis is way behind that of Hong Kong and Australia.&nbsp; In Hong Kong, the ratio is one per 30,000 whilst that of Australia is one to 10,000-12,000 population.&nbsp; The comparative ratio for Singapore is one per 50,000 based on a population of four million.&nbsp; There is, therefore, a need to train more and recruit more from overseas in order to meet the demand as the population ages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this Bill will serve to establish a legislative framework for regulating allied health professions for the protection of the general public.&nbsp; With the introduction of this Bill, the professional competency of allied health professionals will be strengthened and the public can be assured of a higher standard of care.&nbsp; It also provides a proper regime to handle complaints and disciplining errant practitioners.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The establishment of the Allied Health Professions Council as the regulatory body for the prescribed allied health professions will empower it to handle all matters, including registrations, training requirements and programmes, professional conduct and disciplinary proceedings of allied health professionals.&nbsp; The more structured registration process is important in accrediting allied health professionals.&nbsp; Due to the current shortage of allied health professionals, we will expect many to be recruited from overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allied health professions encompass a varied and diverse group of healthcare professionals.&nbsp; The current list in the First Schedule has included just 10 professions, namely, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, audiologist, clinical psychologist, radiographer, radiation therapist, podiatrist, prosthetist and dietician.&nbsp; The attempt to <p align=left>Column: 2024<p>regulate a wide spectrum of healthcare professionals in a common Bill can be interpreted as one of convenience and can lead to many challenges, due to the diverse job descriptions and their individual peculiarities.&nbsp; The harmonisation of the registers of practitioners, complaints proceedings, composition of disciplinary tribunals and its various committees can be very complex.&nbsp; I applaud the Ministry for this concerted effort in drafting this umbrella legislation with subsidiary legislations covering the various professions.&nbsp; Though tedious, it is definitely a more efficient option than to take a piecemeal approach that can be very time consuming.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst I welcome the introduction of this Bill, I would like to raise some concerns for the Minister&rsquo;s consideration.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the current list depicted in the first schedule, will the Minister consider regulating the chiropractors, homeopaths and the other allied health professions in the near future?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 6 of the Bill spells out the composition of the Allied Health Professions Council. Will there be a minimum representation from the various allied health discipline and is there a maximum number of members in the Council?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 15 provides that the Registrar may remove the name of a practitioner who has not renewed his practising certificate for a continuous period of not less than two years.&nbsp; For such practitioners whose registrations have lapsed and deregistered as a result for whatever the reasons may be, what is the mechanism for the reinstatement of the practising rights?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 18 deals with the conditional registration of allied health professionals.&nbsp; Conditions are imposed on practitioners<p align=left>Column: 2025<p>under this registration and this is often applicable to fresh graduates and returning overseas practitioners.&nbsp; Should these conditional registrants work under close supervision in a public institution where the working conditions usually provide a more comprehensive training and supervisory environment or can they be attached to private institutions where the workload and scope can be more restricted?&nbsp; Is there a maximum number of years or maximum number of renewals imposed on these conditional registrants?&nbsp; Practitioners who are placed under conditional registration for a prolonged period usually reflect the dubious competency of the allied health worker.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 37 provides a voluntary insight mechanism for the registered allied health professional who believes that his fitness to practise is impaired by reason of his physical or mental condition; or the quality of his professional services does not commensurate with the minimum standard which is reasonable to expect of an allied health professional to voluntarily restrict, suspend or remove his practising rights.&nbsp; On the contrary, how would the Ministry of Health handle cases where the practitioners deliberately hide their physical, mental or professional incompetence and continue practising without informing the Council?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill also provides for the Disciplinary Proceedings with clauses 43 and 44 allowing the Complaints Committee to refer parties involved in the complaints for mediation and appointing an investigator to investigate the case respectively.&nbsp; I would like to clarify with the Minister &ndash; how are the mediators and investigators selected and what are the necessary credentials for their appointment?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will there also be guidelines on the advertisements of allied health practitioners, similar to that of the medical profession?</p><p align=left>Column: 2026<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would also like the Minister to clarify the roles of the Performance Assessment Panel, Fitness Assessment Panel and the Health Committee as there is a tendency to misinterpret them as being synonymous.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the practice of medicine is always evolving and the various disciplines of allied health professions are no exceptions.&nbsp; Practitioners must continue to remain relevant and competent by upgrading their knowledge and skills.&nbsp; Just like the medical, dental, optometrist and opticianry professionals, a compulsory continual professional education programme will be necessary for all allied health practitioners.&nbsp; While establishing one can be achieved easily, the coordination of the various requirements can be challenging considering the diverse groups of allied health workers.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed Bill will inevitably raise the standard and professionalism of allied health professionals.&nbsp; This mirrors very closely those of other healthcare professionals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.23 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is an important one and represents a milestone for allied health professionals.&nbsp; Accreditation is indeed the way forward.&nbsp; We cannot run away from surveillance of competence and practice performance.&nbsp; With the rising expectations from all sectors, maintaining good standing and standards of care is indeed crucial.&nbsp; This Bill will most certainly enhance the credibility of our allied health professionals, an increasingly important group of our multi-disciplinary healthcare teams.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 2027<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a few issues to raise.&nbsp; Firstly, in the initial stages, only occupational and speech therapists as well as physiotherapists will be regulated.&nbsp; What will be a timeframe for the rest of the allied health professionals to be regulated?&nbsp; I hope that this will not take too long.&nbsp; I also agree that, as this can be considered as an omnibus Bill covering so many professions in allied health, we may face many teething issues which require finetuning along the way; and thus a call for flexibility and adaptability on the part of those concerned.&nbsp; Lessons can be taken from the Opticians and Optometrists Bill which was introduced in 2007 and until today, there are still finetuning issues going on.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the various different categories of registrations stipulated.&nbsp; This is very much similar to that used by the medical professionals.&nbsp; When using this categorisation, it becomes important that we have:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; adequate supervision by trained supervisors;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; proper documentation of practices and maintaining of logs of certain skills; and</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; a coordinated central secretariat to monitor and surveil accordingly.&nbsp; This would mean having enough manpower as the duties can be very labour intensive.&nbsp; This secretariat will have to network, coordinate and liaise very closely with the various institutions.&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p>It is, thus, necessary to keep the registration framework simple and easy to execute and monitor.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the passing of this Bill, Sir, it is inevitable that continuous learning and continuing education must become formalised.&nbsp; As in other professions, I feel that it must be linked to the renewal of practising certification.&nbsp; The Ministry will <p align=left>Column: 2028<p>have to decide on the timeline for renewal, eg, yearly, two-yearly, three-yearly, and so on.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support that the Allied Health Professions Council should have representatives from all different professions.&nbsp; But instead of having equal numbers from each profession, will it be possible to use a proportionate formula?&nbsp; For example, since we have more physiotherapists compared to, say, speech therapists, we should have more of the former represented on the Council, who will then work with the hierarchical committees and professional boards to be set up at different institutions and levels.&nbsp; This way, the model will be one of a \"division of labour\".<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, one of the areas which I feel should be given special attention to is the definition of \"job scope\", ie, what can and cannot be carried out by these professionals.&nbsp; This is important as there may arise frequent situations where there is a relatively blurred line between actions that can be carried out by, say, a physiotherapist versus an occupational therapist.&nbsp; In teaching institutions, for example, whereby there are clear distinct guidelines and definitions, usually there may not be any problems.&nbsp; However, in the private sector, this can sometimes be a bit more nebulous and for the more generic tasks, however, I agree that harmonisation of standards is, of course, acceptable.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, will the Ministry of Health&nbsp;(MOH) consider licensing premises where allied health professional services are practised and offered?&nbsp; This can act as another level of checking mechanism besides just regulating the professionals themselves.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, I am highly excited about this Bill and I am looking forward to its implementation.&nbsp; I feel it will enhance the <p align=left>Column: 2029<p> performance of our allied health professionals &ndash; my partners in healthcare delivery.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.27 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I extend my compliments to the Minister for Health for his continuous effort to keep our medical professionals up to speed with the changing demands in our society.&nbsp; His latest is the Allied Health Professions Bill.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am heartened to note that the Ministry is placing ample emphasis on identifying the qualifications and abilities of allied health practitioners.&nbsp; Allied health professionals are just as important to the nation&rsquo;s health as doctors, for they are the ones who help patients get back to full health after a major treatment process.&nbsp; They also help ease the workload of doctors so that they can focus on the more critical issues in healthcare.&nbsp; Thus, allied professionals become more sought-after.&nbsp; It is, therefore, prudent that we ensure that the capability and qualifications of this group of people are up to the mark.&nbsp; I trust that the new measures announced in the Bill will help to address some patients' concerns.&nbsp; For far too long we have many who claim to be experts in dietary and would recommend all sorts of menu to maintain good health and to detoxify one&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; So, too, we have some foot reflexologists who claim to be able to treat all kinds of ills, not to mention the <I>tui na</I> practitioners who sometimes claim to be able to cure most ailments.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the new method of categorisation of allied health professionals, we are now able to clearly identify whether someone is fully qualified or partially qualified, which would undoubtedly be useful in employment and assigning duties.&nbsp; However, in the field of <p align=left>Column: 2030<p>allied health, there are already many different specialties and sub-specialties. We need to be careful in not creating too many sub-specialties and complicate life for the patients.&nbsp; I think my parliamentary colleague has mentioned that we must be very clear about this sub-specialisation for our patients.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Bill does not state how allied health professionals practising under the conditional registration category may qualify for full registration.&nbsp; Considering that the full registration category bears immense personal responsibility, it is important to make clear how applicants' abilities and knowledge will be assessed to gain access for an upgrade in registration.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also note that professionals under the temporary registration category are likely to be teachers, researchers and postgraduates who will concentrate most of their work and research in medical education institutions and departments, while interning in hospitals and clinics.&nbsp; In this case, I wish to inquire whether it would be their school or the place of internship that will be responsible for reviewing their performance and supervision.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I hope that the Allied Health Professions Council would not to be bogged down with all the nitty-gritty of registration and the various sub-committees or sub-specialisations but have the time to look at the distant horizon and draw up policies and guidelines to ensure that the community will enjoy the maximum benefit from the whole exercise of qualification and registration.</p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

I rise in strong support for this important Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As our population ages and chronic ailments prevail, adequacy of healthcare provision and healthcare costs&nbsp;is of primary concern for all Singaporeans, particularly the older Singaporeans.&nbsp; Allied healthcare professionals are an indispensable and important group that supports the healthcare needs of Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes setting up a single regulatory body &ndash; the Allied Health Professions Council &ndash; to oversee the conduct and the practice of allied healthcare professionals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have&nbsp;three short queries for the Minister.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Sir, may I ask the Minister the timeframe his Ministry has in mind for the regulatory framework to be set up and operational to cover all the allied health professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, my&nbsp;concern relates to the&nbsp;diversity of the professions this proposed Council is tasked to represent and oversee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can&nbsp;the Minister provide details on how the&nbsp;Council&nbsp;members will be elected&nbsp;and the relationship of the Council to the respective professional organisations?&nbsp; For example, will the Presidents of each of these professional organisations be invited to the membership of the Council?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the Minister see a parallel between this proposed Bill to regulate allied healthcare professionals and the regulation of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)?&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, what is the learning point we can take from the regulation of TCM?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My final concern relates to cost.&nbsp; Sir, does the Minister anticipate that because of regulation, cost of seeking treatment from allied healthcare professionals will increase?&nbsp; Are there implications of regulation on reimbursements by insurance companies?&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 2032<p>\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Increasingly, allied health professionals will play a greater role as they are a key pillar in any healthcare institution working alongside doctors, nurses and other ancillary staff.&nbsp; It is foreseeable that the demand for their services will also rise across our private and public healthcare institutions.<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph;

With the registration of such professionals in the likes of nurses, pharmacists and doctors, there are inherent issues which need to be considered with the introduction of this Bill.&nbsp; From a public or the patient's perspective, it is essential that this group of healthcare professionals who have direct contact with patients and service users provide high quality care.&nbsp; Through this Bill, quality of care will be strengthened if comprehensive arrangements are put in place that require allied health professionals to meet lucid, minimum standards of practice, codes of conduct and pre-registration training before they can be registered and licensed.&nbsp; It will, therefore, be an important element of the new regulatory arrangements to establish clear criteria, in terms of qualifications or experience for admission to the register.&nbsp; There should also be clear procedures to manage those who fail in the registration and the readmission process.&nbsp; I believe quality of care will surely be strengthened if they are required to meet specified training and practice standards which extend to post-registration as well as strict continuing education and training requirements whether on an on-going basis or periodically.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph;

By the same token, with this new Bill, allied health professionals can now be <p align=left>Column: 2033<p>subjected to disciplinary proceedings if their actions or behaviour fall short of accepted standards.&nbsp; Unfortunately, from an allied healthcare professional's perspective, with a robust regulatory and licensing framework comes the need to safeguard themselves from discipline, litigation and malpractice issues just like doctors and lawyers.&nbsp; As such, there should be a need for such professionals to be covered by a compulsory professional indemnity insurance which must be low cost as many of these professionals, in particular the new hires, may find this insurance exceedingly onerous and costly.&nbsp; In particular, those operating on a freelance basis and not employed or attached to any major healthcare institution or establishment will also find this an added financial burden.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph;

From these allied healthcare professionals' perspective, they would want to know if there are any safeguards to protect them in cases where trigger-happy patients lodge complaints which are frivolous.&nbsp; There is also a question of who can represent these allied health professionals if they are called before the regulator or disciplinary body to answer any complaint or charge.&nbsp; Although the Bill sets up a system to handle complaints, it should be a definitive and transparent system for complaints management and discipline so that the allied health professional, patient, regulator, the Ministry of Health and the public can withstand close scrutiny whilst at the same time uphold the profession, rule of law and natural justice.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph;

Further, with the growth of new media and rampant use of the Internet, I am also keen to know how issues regarding the giving of advice on care or treatment by allied health professionals via the Internet will be dealt with as the level and quality of advice and care will differ and vary.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph;

The Chiropractic Association (Singapore) is a voluntary organisation and as such, membership is voluntary. It can self-regulate its members but if the rogues of the profession either terminate membership or are ineligible for membership as their business practices fall outside its standards, there is no way to rein them in.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill delineates the scope of practice of scheduled professions and chiropractors feel that there is a lot of overlap between physiotherapists and them.&nbsp; While chiropractors say that they do not call themselves physiotherapists, they are understandably concerned that they do not lose the right to perform procedures that they have been duly qualified to perform in accredited courses due to their exclusion from the Bill.&nbsp; It would be good if the Minister could enlighten us.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;propose to take the break now.&nbsp; I suspend the Sitting and will&nbsp;take the&nbsp;Chair again at 4.00 pm.<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=\"right\"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting accordingly suspended</I></p><p align=\"right\"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at 3.42 pm until 4.00 pm.</I></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS BILL-->\t<p align=left>Column: 2034<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p align=\"center\"><em>Sitting resumed at 4.00 pm</em></p><p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><strong>ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS BILL</strong></p><p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Debate resumed.</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the five Members who have spoken on the Bill for their strong support. Let me address their various comments and valuable suggestions.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min noted that the Bill is quite different from the other health <p align=left>Column: 2035<p>professional registration laws as&nbsp;the&nbsp;scope this time round is wide and varied. Assoc. Prof. Paulin Tay&nbsp;Straughan asked if we could draw useful lessons from the regulation of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The registration laws for the different healthcare professions are generally similar as they all seek to protect the public from unqualified practitioners or those who are unethical. Not surprisingly, there are similarities in approach.&nbsp;When drafting this Bill, we have taken references from several countries, including Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The omnibus approach to this Bill, resulting in it being therefore wide and varied, is for a practical consideration as noted by several Members, including Dr Lam. But the strategic intent of raising professional standard, safeguarding consumer interest and promoting high ethical practices is similar to how we regulate doctors, dentists, pharmacists or TCM physicians.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However as the range is wide, adequate representation on the Council is therefore a valid concern. I have addressed this earlier in my&nbsp;second reading speech. Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef suggested some sort of a proportionate representation of each profession on the Council. The Bill allows us to appoint more than one member of each profession on the Council. Where a profession has more than, say 500 registrants, I suppose we can appoint two Council members. But for now, we will start with one representative each, and see how it goes. The first Council will start off with the Director of Medical Services or his representative; the Director-General of Education or his representative; the Registrar; one physiotherapist, one occupational therapist, and one speech therapist.&nbsp;We will make sure all of them would&nbsp;have&nbsp;at least 10 years of practical experience. We will add new members as needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2036<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min asked if we would put a cap on the size of the Council. We are thinking of keeping it&nbsp;to 25 members so that it does not become too big. Let me add that the Allied Health Professions Council is, first and foremost, a regulator. Its primary duty is to ensure the safety and welfare of the public. It is not set up to promote or advocate the different professions&rsquo; interest. In regulating these professions, the Council needs to ensure that the standards and regulatory policies are relevant to the different groups, and can effectively address any regulatory issues unique to the profession. The Council will have to consult extensively with the different professions and stakeholders as it further develops and implements the regulatory policies and standards. It will be supported by advisory committees and boards, comprising experienced practitioners from the professions. It should also learn from other allied health regulators overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef felt it is&nbsp;important to define clearly what each profession can and cannot do. We will define the knowledge, skills, and training required for each specific allied health profession. We will set standards on practice, conduct and ethics. But in defining what the professionals can or cannot do, we must be careful not to hinder other legitimate service providers from providing services which they are competent to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee noted some overlap in the scope of practice between chiropractors and physiotherapists. She wondered if chiropractors would lose their right to practice what they are trained for. They will not. The Bill does not grant monopoly power to a particular profession. For example, both voice coaches and speech therapists provide voice training. If you are a teacher, and you want to control and project your voice better, a voice coach could well do<p align=left>Column: 2037<p>the job. However, if you have just had a stroke and need help to regain your speech, you would need a speech therapist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even amongst the allied health professions, there are overlapping areas of practice,&nbsp;as noted by Ms Ellen Lee. For example, hand therapy may be carried out by both physiotherapists and occupational therapists; and difficulties in swallowing may be managed by both occupational therapists and speech therapists. As healthcare becomes increasingly team-based and integrated, it is more important that a profession is allowed to practice what they have been trained to do so long as they can demonstrate competence in doing so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not want to reduce access to services, or choices for consumers because that will push up cost. However, it is important to help consumers make an informed choice. Therefore, we have to protect the titles and the practice of the profession under the title, and not the scope of practice. In so doing, when patients need an allied health professional&rsquo;s expertise, the professional titles used will serve as a guide for them, as will the register of practitioners which will be readily accessible on the Internet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef, Mdm Cynthia Phua and Ms Ellen Lee commented on the registration framework. We have adopted a tiered registration framework as we have found it useful in regulating the other health professions. A tiered system allows practitioners of diverse background and training continued access to our system for the provision of care without compromising public safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me briefly explain how the registration framework will work. Full and conditional registration will apply to most <p align=left>Column: 2038<p>practitioners. All practitioners who have approved qualifications or have passed the local qualifying examinations will be eligible for registration in either one of these two categories. For those who have been practising as an allied health professional in Singapore, they will be directly eligible for full registration. New graduates, or those who have little or no experience of practising in Singapore will first be conditionally registered and required to work under supervision. After completing their supervised practice period with no adverse performance reports, they will be able to convert to full registration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam asked if supervised practice during conditional registration can be done in private institutions. The answer is \"yes\". We will&nbsp;allow it, provided&nbsp;the private organisations have the capabilities and standards to supervise such professionals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among those who are currently practising in Singapore, there is a small number whose basic professional qualifications are not recognised. However, they have been serving patients for many years in their jobs. They should be allowed to continue in their practice, and serving the patient groups they are familiar with. Restricted registration will apply to this group of practitioners, where they will only be allowed to work with client groups they are familiar with, or only in specified employment or places of practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will also be practitioners whose basic professional qualifications are not recognised, but have had good quality post-graduate training and practice experience in a particular area of the profession; or others who may have practised exclusively in a particular area of practice, such as sports physiotherapy, or paediatric occupational therapy, for a long period of time. Restricted registration may also be applicable to these individuals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2039<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allied health professionals employed for the purpose of teaching, training or research, must also be registered. Competence and conduct issues remain relevant. When they are here for a short stint of a few weeks or months or do not have qualifications that are on the list of approved qualifications, temporary registration is needed. In areas of critical manpower shortages, temporary registration can also be applied as a stop-gap measure. Such a practitioner must work under supervision at all times. In this way, the tiered registration framework allows us flexibility to manage our&nbsp;manpower challenges and at the same time, protecting public safety and consumer interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam asked about the process for renewal of registration for practitioners whose registration has lapsed. The practitioner can apply, or the Council can restore the name to a register on its own motion. The name will be restored to the same register if there is no reason not to do so. Otherwise, the Council can place the person on conditional or restricted registration as well. The details are in clauses 27, 56, and 59.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam and Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef asked if compulsory continuing professional education will be required. The Bill does provide for the Council to mandate continuing professional education to grant or renew practicing certificates. When implemented, this will better assure the public that registered professionals will be up-to-date in their knowledge and practice. As Ms Ellen Lee pointed out, this will strengthen the quality of care provided. The Council will consider this after completing the registration of existing practitioners. Given the wide range of the professions, the Council will set up committees to set the policies, standards and requirements for continuing professional education. The committees will comprise the relevant allied health professionals. Continuing professional <p align=left>Column: 2040<p>education activities will be co-ordinated by the professional bodies, healthcare institutions, and other education providers as is the case with other healthcare professions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee asked if there were safeguards to protect registrants against frivolous complaints. These are provided for in the Bill. The complaint must be made in writing and supported by a statutory declaration. The professional will be given the opportunity to present his case. The Complaints Committee will review and investigate the complaints thoroughly, and only serious complaints will be directed for formal inquiries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee asked who could represent the allied health professional&nbsp;when&nbsp;he is called to answer a case against him. When the complaint is reviewed by the Complaints Committee, the allied health professional will not generally be required to appear before the Committee. Instead, he may be asked to provide a written exculpatory statement. It is only when the complaint is directed for further inquiry at the Disciplinary Tribunal or Health Committee, would his attendance at the proceedings be required. And at this stage, he can engage a legal counsel to represent him if he wants to. This follows the practice in other health professional regulatory Councils.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam sought clarification on the different roles of the Performance Assessment Panel (PAP), Fitness Assessment Panel (FAP) and Interim Orders Committee (IOC). The Performance Assessment Panel will be appointed by the Complaints Committee if there is an issue of the quality of professional services provided by the professional. This is set out in clause 45. The FAP will be appointed where&nbsp;the professional&rsquo;s fitness to practice is in doubt by reason of his physical or mental condition. This is in clause 46. The IOC will be invoked when <p align=left>Column: 2041<p>immediate or urgent action is required for the protection of members of the public or it is otherwise in the public interest or in the interests of the allied health professional concerned. The IOC may order that his registration be suspended or be made subject to conditions or restrictions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam asked if there would be guidelines on advertisements of practitioners. We will set these guidelines in the ethical codes for the allied health professions, similar to the medical profession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Paulin Tay&nbsp;Straughan expressed concerns on the cost of regulation. Any regulation will come with a cost. The key is to minimise the cost of regulation. Indeed, one reason for taking an omnibus approach is to try to reduce the overhead cost, so that it will be minimised for the professions and the clients that they served. Our sense is that any cost impact will not be significant for as long as the market is sufficiently competitive. I think pricing is more of a function of how competitive the market is. This was our experience when we started regulating the optometrists and opticians. The Bill will not affect the choices available to consumers and patients regarding the type of services they seek.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Paulin Tay&nbsp;Straughan wondered if regulation would impact reimbursement decisions by insurers. This is really something for the insurers to decide. Currently some insurance policies do reimburse for some allied health professional services. I suppose they will then&nbsp;price it into the premiums.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee was concerned&nbsp;with the burden on the allied health professionals if they are subject to costly indemnity insurance. I agree with her that it will be<p align=left>Column: 2042<p>prudent for practitioners to have arrangements either through their employers for some sort of indemnity, or if they are self-employed, to have their own indemnity insurance. In the public healthcare sector, we employ quite a large number of the professionals and, we have that kind of arrangement. In our experience&nbsp;the cost of such insurance, while market determined,&nbsp;is not too prohibitive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee asked how the quality of care provided over the Internet will be dealt with. This&nbsp;is an&nbsp;emerging issue and probably would be challenging as well. At the moment, for allied health services, by our observation,&nbsp;is not yet a significant issue. But I agree that the Internet will open up new possibilities and challenges.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>Some of the other regulatory councils are currently looking into this issue, and it will be appropriate to develop this as a policy across all healthcare professionals. <p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several Members asked about the implementation timeline.&nbsp; If the Bill is passed, we will set up the regulatory framework and get it operational for the three professions within a year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have, as you see in the First Schedule, listed 10 groups.&nbsp; I scanned the range of allied health professions regulated in other countries and by and large, these are the 10 professions which are being regulated in Australia, the United Kingdom and United States. We will start with the three therapy professions in the first phase and then this will be followed by another three professions:&nbsp; clinical psychologists, diagnostic radiographers and radiation therapists.&nbsp; These are the six professions which we already have local education and training programmes.&nbsp; For the rest of the professions we will bring on board as well.&nbsp; My own estimate is that we should be able to complete the registration of the&nbsp;10 professions within the next term of Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2043<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee and Dr Lam asked if chiropractors would be included in this Bill.&nbsp; My Ministry is studying the regulation of chiropractors in some countries.&nbsp; Where they are regulated, they are regulated as &ldquo;complementary and alternative health practitioners&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are&nbsp;studying the need for such a piece of legislation and it is an assignment which probably will be in our work plan during the next few years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the allied health professionals form an important pillar of our healthcare system.

Today, it sounds almost quaint that 50 years ago, the Legislative Assembly had to pass a law to impose monogamy on our population. This law also provided for the rights and duties of married persons, the protection of family, the maintenance of wives and children, and the punishment of offences against women. This has been one of the defining pieces of social legislation; it has shaped our society and made an impact on our family relationships.&nbsp; It is worthwhile even today as we contemplate amending this law for us to reaffirm the family as the key pillar of our society.&nbsp; The family still forms the best foundation for nurturing our children. It is the nest from which we pursue our hopes and dreams; it is a shelter from the vicissitudes of life, and hopefully a haven for us to spend our last days in dignity and serenity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, the family is under strain. Mirroring global trends, divorces in Singapore have been increasing over the last two decades.&nbsp; There were 1.3 divorces per 1,000 people in 1990.&nbsp; This has now increased to 2.0 divorces per 1,000 of the population in 2003.&nbsp; Whilst these crude divorce rates appear to have stabilised around 2.0, the overall numbers are still high.&nbsp; Between 2005 and 2009, an average of 6,025 divorces were filed every year at the Family Court and an additional 1,780 at the Syariah Court. More tellingly, recent cohorts of marriages are divorcing faster and earlier. If we look at people who married in 1987, 3.2% had divorced within five years. If you fast forward to the year 2002 &ndash; of those who<p align=left>Column: 2045<p>were married in that year, 5.3% had divorced five years later.&nbsp; So the point is that the survival span of marriages is falling. Equally worrying is the high incidence of defaults on maintenance payments.&nbsp; Over the last four years, there were about 3,400 applications for enforcement of maintenance orders every year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But beyond the statistics, we also must bear in mind that the fallout from broken families is felt most keenly by the children involved. It is important therefore for us to mitigate the negative impact of family breakdown on children as far as possible. And parents play the most crucial and irreplaceable role in this.&nbsp; The maintenance of children is not the be all and end all of parental responsibility, but it is the starting point, it is an absolute necessity inasmuch as both parents are capable of doing so.&nbsp; And this responsibility cannot be abrogated to the larger community or to the State. Children need to be assured of their parents&rsquo; love and commitment despite the marital breakdown.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, one of the key objectives of this Bill is to enhance the divorce and maintenance enforcement procedures so as to empower individuals and the Courts with more options in order to resolve the issues and to mitigate the impact on children.&nbsp; In addition, this Bill also updates our laws pertaining to the requirements for marriages between Singaporeans and permanent residents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am aware that these family issues cut across all strata of society and affect most people very deeply. These are emotive issues and many people have very strong views.&nbsp; And that is why we embarked on an extensive consultation prior to the moving of this Bill. Many organisations and members of public had, at various points of the review, taken<p align=left>Column: 2046<p>their time to develop and submit detailed recommendations for my Ministry&rsquo;s consideration.&nbsp; I would like at this point to thank everyone for their valuable contributions. Naturally, we could not adopt every single recommendation because there was a diversity of views and sometimes even conflicting and contradictory views. And it is not possible for me here to detail our response to each suggestion but, for those of you who are interested, please log on to the REACH website and a more detailed response is available there.&nbsp; I would say that generally, in assessing all the recommendations, we were guided by the overall thrust of the Charter which is focused on protecting vulnerable family members, and also in keeping with our philosophy that the family should be the first line of support for all of us.&nbsp; At present, the Bill has incorporated much of what was submitted, during the last, in fact, two years of consideration.&nbsp; And I think the Bill is all the better for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now go through the amendments in this Bill, starting first with the marriage laws.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Streamlining of marriage requirement</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current law requires at least one party of a couple intending to register their marriage in Singapore to have resided in Singapore for at least 15 days before a notice of marriage can be filed. The rationale is to ensure that there is an appropriate nexus between the marrying parties and our local marriage jurisdiction. Basically we do not want Singapore to become a place for a marriage of convenience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With more Singaporeans and permanent residents residing overseas however, this requirement may have unintended consequences.&nbsp; Together with the minimum period of 21 days required between filing and solemnisation of marriage, overseas parties may sometimes<p align=left>Column: 2047<p>have to take extended leave of at least 36 days if they wish to marry in Singapore. Clause 2 amends section 17(2)(a) to waive the 15-day residency requirement for overseas couples where both parties are either Singaporeans or permanent residents.&nbsp; This eases marriage procedures for such couples, whilst the law will continue to safeguard our marriage regime against abuse by people who have no relevant connection to Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Measures to address divorce and mitigate its impact</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill also seeks to reduce the risk of divorce and to mitigate its impact. There are four main changes as outlined in clauses 2-5 and clauses 12-16.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the proposed amendments to section 17(2)(f), section 21(1)(a) and the new section 17A empower the Minister to require certain categories of persons to attend a marriage preparation programme before they can be issued with a marriage license.&nbsp; Let me quickly reassure the House that the intention here is not to prevent anyone from marrying, but to better equip people who are getting married or who may face a higher risk of divorce for the challenges of married life.&nbsp; We know, for instance, that minors &ndash; that is young people who have less experience in life and are less prepared to cope with the stresses that come with marriage, such as managing inter-personal relationships, bringing up children, managing finances, handling conflicts, and so on&nbsp;&ndash; are at greater risk of divorce.&nbsp; Analysis of marriages and divorces in Singapore has shown that an individual marrying at the age of 20 is 1.4 to 1.8 times more likely to divorce than if he or she had married at the age of 25, assuming all other characteristics are the same.&nbsp; The marriage preparation programmes for minors will help them to better prepare for marriage, both psychologically and in a practical way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2048<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the amendments introduce a new requirement in section 50(3A)-(3E) for divorcing parties who have children to undergo counseling and/or mediation at the Family Court.&nbsp; This will be done after they have filed for divorce. Unfortunately, the interests of children are sometimes compromised by acrimonious battles between divorcing parents, on custody and other related issues. With this measure, trained counsellors and mediators who are familiar with both the legal as well as the emotional/ psychological dimensions of disputes can help these parties to work out effective arrangements in the children&rsquo;s best interests.&nbsp; And I urge all parents to consider their children&rsquo;s welfare as paramount when settling ancillary matters pursuant to a divorce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the Bill makes related amendments to the Children&rsquo;s Development and Co-savings Act to allow the Court to transfer matrimonial assets divided between parents into a Children Development Account.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will safeguard the interests of the children by earmarking some of these monies for their developmental needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, a new Chapter 4A of Part X will be introduced in the Charter to empower the Singapore courts to provide financial relief for divorces granted in overseas courts which are also recognised in Singapore. Under the present law, the Singapore court has power to grant important ancillary financial orders for maintenance of the ex-spouse and children and for the division of matrimonial assets if the parties obtain a divorce from a Singapore court, but not if they have already obtained a divorce overseas. Sir, with the increasing number of Singaporeans working and residing overseas and increasing marriages between locals and foreigners, this proposed provision will help those who&nbsp;are <p align=left>Column: 2049<p>made vulnerable by foreign divorces and who have a relevant connection to Singapore to seek relief.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give Members an example:&nbsp;&nbsp;A Singaporean woman who marries a foreigner and then lives in a matrimonial home in Singapore.&nbsp; Suppose&nbsp;the foreign spouse then obtains a divorce from a foreign court which is recognised in Singapore but for some reason makes no financial provisions.&nbsp; Currently, the Singaporean spouse will have no financial remedy in Singapore because the Singapore courts do not have the power to make such ancillary orders.&nbsp;With this new Chapter, the courts here will be able to make orders on matrimonial assets in Singapore and the maintenance for divorces that were obtained in foreign courts.&nbsp; This will plug an existing gap.&nbsp; The related amendments will also be made to the Central Provident Fund Act to effect this, as CPF monies may constitute part of the matrimonial assets to be divided between parties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Strengthening enforcement of maintenance orders</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the other main thrust of this Bill is to strengthen the enforcement of maintenance orders.&nbsp; Members of this House may recall that I had spoken at length in March last year on how the courts and my Ministry propose to make the enforcement process less onerous and to address&nbsp;the high default<I>&nbsp;</I> rates.&nbsp; The Family Court has already reduced the number of trips the complainant has to make by exempting the complainant from the service of summons stage and by reducing the number of mentions wherever possible.&nbsp; The option to file a complaint by a video-link at social service agencies will also be up and ready later this year, thus making it more convenient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts had also announced in February last year that more attachment <p align=left>Column: 2050<p>of earnings orders will be issued to require employers of defaulters to pay maintenance directly out of their salary.&nbsp; However, these attachments of earnings may lapse when a person switches to a new employer. &nbsp;&nbsp;To address this gap, section 85 will now be amended to allow the complainant to obtain a disclosure order from the court to get the CPF Board to release information on the employment status of the maintenance payer.&nbsp; The court can then make a new order to attach the payer's earnings from the new employer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance the processes further, clause 8 amends section 79 to allow a committee of judges and lawyers to make rules from maintenance cases, including enforcement proceedings.&nbsp; This will facilitate the court in requiring parties to furnish all relevant information, especially on financial matters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address the high default rate, clauses 2, 4, 6 and 7 will introduce new sanctions against defaulters.&nbsp; To begin with, the courts' options will be expanded with more sanctions against recalcitrant defaulters.&nbsp; Currently, the courts may direct the arrears to be collected from the defaulter as if it were a fine and send him to jail or make a garnishee order against him.&nbsp; These sanctions are not imposable if the defaulter agrees to pay up at the last minute during a hearing.&nbsp; Imprisonment may also cause defaulters to lose their jobs and thereby exacerbate the problem of non-payment of maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 71(d) to&nbsp;(f) and&nbsp;new sections 71A, 71B&nbsp;and 71C introduce three new sanctions, namely, the imposition of a banker's guarantee against future defaults; secondly, mandatory financial counselling; and thirdly, by community service orders.&nbsp; The banker's guarantee is targeted at those who have the financial means to pay, including those who are self-employed or not on regular employment, for whom an attachment of <p align=left>Column: 2051<p>earnings order may not apply.&nbsp; Mandatory financial counselling will be imposed on defaulters who claim to have genuine financial difficulties but lack financial prudence.&nbsp; It is hoped that with some guidance, such defaulters can make good their responsibilities.&nbsp; Community service orders will be meted out as a punitive deterrent against recalcitrant defaulters, such as those who default repeatedly and pay up at the last minute with no cost to themselves.&nbsp; It is also a useful substitute for jail which can be imposed without hampering the defaulter's ability to work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, section 71(2B) to (2D) empowers complainants to report maintenance debts to designated credit bureaus.&nbsp; This aims to encourage defaulters to pay up or risk tarnishing the credit reputation and their ability to secure loans from banks and other financial institutions.&nbsp; Lastly, we have seen many defaulters who cite their obligations to a new family in order to justify their inability to pay maintenance to the previous family.&nbsp; As such, remarrying persons will now be required to make a statutory declaration on whether they currently owe any maintenance arrears.&nbsp; This measure signals to the remarrying party that obligations to one's previous family, especially children, continue even after remarriage.&nbsp; It also keeps the potential spouse aware of the partner's outstanding obligations.&nbsp; Whilst the presence of arrears will not bar the marriage from taking place, this measure provides an added impetus for defaulters to pay up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally, the Bill also updates the Charter with some technical amendments which I will outline in brief.&nbsp; Clauses 9 and 10 spell out new options for the court for&nbsp;service of summons and stipulate how attachment of earnings orders are to be served.&nbsp; Clause 13 makes a technical amendment to section 130 on how the court should&nbsp;regard the advice of welfare officers,&nbsp;and clause 17 makes related <p align=left>Column: 2052<p>amendments to align the Guardianship of&nbsp;Infants Act to section 130.&nbsp; Clauses 14 and 15 make consequential amendments to section 132(1) and related amendments to the CPF Act respectively to account for the new Part 4A on financial relief for foreign divorces.&nbsp; Lastly, clause 18 empowers the Minister to make regulations of savings or transitional nature for a period of two years, to account for any further technical amendments to the Women's Charter or other Acts arising from this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me conclude by emphasising the intent of this Bill.&nbsp; This Bill aims to facilitate marriages of overseas Singaporeans and Permanent Residents, to better prepare at-risk couples for marriage, to mitigate the impact of divorces and to strengthen the enforcement of maintenance orders.&nbsp; These amendments are aimed at making a real, positive difference in the lives of families, and especially the more vulnerable children and spouses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It bears&nbsp;repeating here what I stated during the debate on the Maintenance of Parents Act.&nbsp; The fact that the majority of us should not have to use the Women's Charter, the Children and Young Persons Act or the Maintenance of Parents Act does not in itself mean that there is no need for legislation that reflects the accepted values of the majority of Singaporeans.&nbsp; The law reflects what we stand for as a society,&nbsp;it reinforces and reminds us of our values and responsibilities. &nbsp;The law also sets out some legal boundaries and liabilities, especially for the minority in our society who may egregiously fail to live up to their familial responsibilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we reaffirm the family as the fundamental pillar of our society and renew our commitment that we will all fulfil our roles as parents, spouses and children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2053<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.37 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me time to give my views on the Women's Charter (Amendment) Bill. <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two main points I want to make: The first&nbsp;is a straightforward one, which addresses the impact of these amendments on the Maintenance of Parents (Amendment) Bill that had been moved at the last sitting.&nbsp; The second point relates to my perspective of a father and husband. Here, I should declare my interest as a board member of the Centre for Fathering &ndash; a VWO that promotes the fathering movement.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as you know, the Maintenance of Parents Act was originally written in the same spirit as the claim for maintenance of wives from their ex-husbands.&nbsp; I am happy to see that enforcement measures in the Women's Charter have been strengthened, in particular to protect women and their dependants, who have been awarded maintenance orders against defaulters. The law proposes to order defaulters to \"furnish security against any future arrears of maintenance\" with a banker's guarantee, attend financial counselling and attend community service, so as&nbsp;to rehabilitate them.&nbsp; I see that the same force against defaulters would be useful under the Maintenance of Parents Act.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a common principle stands behind both maintenance laws, which is that family members owe a duty of care towards one another&nbsp;&ndash; whether between parent and children, children and elderly parents or between spouses.&nbsp; This principle means that we should avoid <p align=left>Column: 2054<p> having the state take over the basic responsibility of a family in looking after its own members.&nbsp; As we always say, when all else fails, the state can and should step in.&nbsp; In addition, we need to remind parents that as we expect children to care for us in old age, it is only fair and rational to support them well, even after a divorce.&nbsp; A man may no longer be a husband, but he remains a father and the duty of care does not diminish.&nbsp; In fact, because of the trauma of divorce on children, I argue that this duty in fact becomes weightier.&nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not often that we see marriage separate from family life but they are, analytically at least, quite distinct. A man is a husband and a father, and as I have said before, when he ceases to be one, he continues in the other.&nbsp; Marriage is a regulatory fact that can be changed; parenthood, a biological one that is immovable.&nbsp; Many of the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter Bill are good and deserved to be supported from a father's perspective.&nbsp; However, there is one area that can be improved&nbsp;&ndash; a father's access to their children after a divorce.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The roles of fathers have changed in the past 10, maybe, 20&nbsp;years and continue to evolve.&nbsp; Fathers are expected not only to bring in the bacon, but to spend time nurturing their children as well.&nbsp; This role should not end after divorce.&nbsp; But the reality is that fathers generally have limited access thereafter, because of the&nbsp; demands from the ex-wife.&nbsp; I ask that the law recognises the parity of parenting in modern society and not allow the anger and frustration of a bad marriage to spill over to the right of a father to see his children.&nbsp; This asymmetry is all the more galling given that it is often the man who writes the cheque to support his children, but it is his wife that controls the access to the children.&nbsp; I do not want to suggest something as crude as a <I>quid pro quo</I> for maintenance <p align=left>Column: 2055<p>payments but the end of a marriage is not an end to a father-child relationship.&nbsp; A man may make a bad husband but he does not automatically make a bad father.&nbsp; Yet the two are often conflated because it is the mother who suggests the grounds on which a father may visit.&nbsp; A man may fight hard on this, and well he should.&nbsp; My point is&nbsp;&ndash; why need he? Why does the law not ensure that he has a reasonable amount of access that he does not have to fight for?&nbsp; The child is also emotionally healthier if he is allowed to maintain a relationship with the father after the divorce.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.42 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments are certainly welcomed. It is sad to see the estranged wife with young children in tow, coming to the Meet-the-People Session to seek redress and at times a listening ear to their woes.&nbsp; I feel that the amendments in themselves will greatly improve the situation for an aggrieved wife to seek redress but the Ministry should look further into simplifying the legal process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legal process still takes up a lot of time for a wife to have to go to and from the court or lawyer's office for various documentations and to make appearances in court. Often the wife has to work to support herself and her children.&nbsp; Going through the legal redress will sometimes result in a loss of income and even loss of jobs.&nbsp; Many of these women are not highly educated or holding normal office jobs.&nbsp; Often, they only have basic education and are working in factories or other establishments where absence from work may mean a deduction in wages and loss of jobs.&nbsp; Hence, for them, an appearance in court is not just a one-hour matter.&nbsp; Besides, they have to undergo the stress <p align=left>Column: 2056<p>and the mental anxiety as often they do not have a clue of what is going on in the courtroom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, any delay in settling the divorce and maintenance will mean the wife has to worry about paying for their monthly bills. She has to ensure the children get a roof over their heads, food at meal time and bus fares to get to the school.&nbsp; The impact of such a situation has very wide implications.&nbsp; Women under such circumstances become very vulnerable, especially if they do not have family members to provide the emotional support.&nbsp; The less fortunate among them may end&nbsp;up taking up jobs that in their right mind they would never have done so, that is, to moonlight in a red light district.&nbsp; The children, too, are vulnerable.&nbsp; With the mother's focus on earning to support the family, the children are neglected. Their school work suffers.&nbsp; Even worse, they become delinquents and get involved in gangland activities.&nbsp; It is easy for us to say the legal process only takes a few months to settle.&nbsp; But translate that into a family environment, a few months are enough to wreck many lives.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, the amendments made here are an improvement but more can be done to shorten the legal process and also the assurances of getting the maintenance fees promptly.&nbsp; My concerns are: I have appealed before and would like to appeal once again for the extension of the legal process beyond the normal business hours.&nbsp; If we can keep the hours to 9.00 pm, this would also allow a woman who is working to turn up for a Court hearing outside her work hours.&nbsp; In addition, more cases can be dealt with and the waiting time is shortened.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I would like to appeal for a change in the legal procedure for non-attendance by the ex-husbands.&nbsp; If the ex-husband does not turn up for a Court hearing, judgment should be made against<p align=left>Column: 2057<p>him and the necessary maintenance due to the ex-wife be given by a bank guarantee.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court should not allow for a postponement or an adjournment of the hearing as it puts the ex-wife under even more stress and unfairness.&nbsp; Otherwise if an adjournment or postponement is given, the family would be denied the basic subsistence which they need urgently.&nbsp; The ex-spouse knowing that judgment would be made against him for non-appearance would then get the firm message that he has to be responsible for the children.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This leads me to the issuance of&nbsp; bank guarantee.&nbsp; There is no mention of top up after it has been used.&nbsp; Also is three months' duration sufficient?&nbsp; The length of the bank guarantee would need to be sufficient to last the whole legal process of the claim for maintenance fee.&nbsp; Based on my experience, six months is needed for even an efficient corporation to recover rent arrears, not to mention an ex-spouse with low education claiming for&nbsp;maintenance arrears.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading section 71A again, the court has asked that the banker&rsquo;s guarantee be handed to the claimant within one month from the date of the order.&nbsp; There is no mention of the consequences if there is a default of handing over of the banker&rsquo;s guarantee.&nbsp; This effectively can mean no money again for the waiting family.&nbsp; To ensure the banker&rsquo;s guarantee is in the hands of the claimant, upon receipt of the application for the claim of maintenance fee and if there is <I>prima facie</I> case of arrears, the court while waiting for the hearing should order the respondent to produce a three-month banker&rsquo;s guarantee at the hearing itself.&nbsp; This way, once a Court judgment is passed, the banker&rsquo;s guarantee can be handed over to the claimants during the hearing instead of the ex-wife having to wait for another month. Worse, if there is no payment, <p align=left>Column: 2058<p>then another application has to be filed and she has to wait and attend another court hearing.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also urge the Minister to consider empowering the auxiliary police force to execute the arrest warrant for enforcement of maintenance orders, instead of relying only on the police force who have many other pressing responsibilities.&nbsp; The errant spouse could be made to bear the cost of engaging the auxiliary police.&nbsp; This will also help to expedite matters.&nbsp; In addition, the warrant of arrest should be made expediently.&nbsp; Presently, we know there are many outstanding warrants of arrest waiting to be served.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I would like to urge the Minister to consider restricting an errant husband who is in arrears of maintenance from travelling overseas, without the Court&rsquo;s permission.&nbsp; In addition, I would like to urge HDB to check with the Credit Bureau in assessing the errant spouse application for public housing as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the preservation of families &ndash; in order to enhance and preserve marriages, I would like to propose that the marriage preparatory course be made compulsory for all marriages instead of only for minors and divorcees.&nbsp; If this cannot be implemented now then we should consider this for the future.&nbsp; Many couples spend at least six months to a year to prepare for their wedding ceremonies.&nbsp; I am very sure that they would not mind spending a weekend or two together attending this course to build a good foundation for their married life.&nbsp; MCYS could recognise the various religious organisations&rsquo; marriage preparation courses.&nbsp; Those who do not want to attend the courses by the religious groups can attend such courses in&nbsp;the Family Service Centres which MCYS is boosting its manpower and providing more resources. To encourage attendance at such courses, in the marriage application to the Registry <p align=left>Column: 2059<p>of Marriages, the question should be asked if the intended couple has attended any marriage preparation course.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the call by AWARE for the marriage preparation course be made mandatory for marriages with spouses who are non-Singapore citizens.&nbsp; This would help both parties to realistically face&nbsp;integration into the Singapore lifestyle and the dependency of the Singapore spouse for the residency status of the non-Singaporean spouse.&nbsp; The non-Singapore spouse is extremely vulnerable when the children are young or should the Singaporean spouse suddenly passed away.&nbsp; I had one case in my MPS last year.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, last year I made a call for mandatory counselling for the children whose parents are undergoing a divorce.&nbsp; I would like to state again that the children are the most vulnerable and the most innocent victims.&nbsp; Please help them.&nbsp; The least we can do is to provide them with mandatory counselling.&nbsp; We need the court to protect them and allow them to address their anxieties, their sorrows and help them with the integration and adjustment to a home with a single parent.&nbsp; Many besides losing their family, also find themselves losing their neighbourhood friends, their classmates, their teachers and so forth because they have to be relocated from their original home.&nbsp; As an adult, not many of us are able to adjust to such major changes, let alone the children.&nbsp; I would like to once again appeal to the Ministry and the Minister to reconsider mandatory counselling at least for a start for children below the age of 12.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Mr Speaker, we are debating on a very important Bill.&nbsp; Within the Malay community, we see many<p align=left>Column: 2060<p>women who are affected and left stranded with hardly any stable source of income even though they have several young children to fend for.&nbsp; Many of them have abundant arrears and bills that are left unpaid and usually these debts are incurred by their ex-husbands.&nbsp; Sometimes, they do not even have a fixed shelter or home.&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is often a major challenge to track down their ex-husbands.&nbsp; How do we correct this difficult and challenging problem?&nbsp; Should we start from the creation of awareness and emphasise on a sense of responsibility from a young age?&nbsp; Should it begin from a good moral upbringing and with parents setting good examples?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen many young ladies left in the lurch in this vicious cycle of dysfunctional families which would be passed on to the following generations.&nbsp; We have to stop this cycle now and take the necessary action.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, all sectors have to work with the Ministry and this includes the voluntary welfare organisations, non-Government organisations, community leaders, schools and mosques.&nbsp; We must stand united, work with one another and, together, prevent and break this unhealthy cycle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I>):&nbsp; It is indeed timely for us to debate this Bill once again.&nbsp; The last amendment was in 1996, some 14 years ago.&nbsp; In clause 2 with reference to section 17, it is stated, \"the Registrar shall not issue a marriage licence unless the party states in the statutory declaration whether he owes any arrears with respect to maintenance which is payable under a maintenance order\".&nbsp; I support this enhancement to the Bill and hope the enforcement and implementation will be carried smoothly.&nbsp; Also, how will the information be communicated to the new spouse?&nbsp; Will it be at or before the <p align=left>Column: 2061<p>marriage agreement?&nbsp; Or formalised at some other settings?<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, pertaining to the marriage preparation course in clause 3 which has by now been implemented for sometime especially by some religious groups but not on a compulsory basis, are there any longitudinal follow-up statistics currently to show co-relation between those who attend the courses and the number of years they stay married?&nbsp; On the contrary, how about those who do not attend the course?&nbsp; Are there statistics to show that there are more divorces amongst these couples?&nbsp; I feel it is important as it is clearly stated in this Bill, Sir, the purpose of this is to reduce the rate of divorces among the prescribed classes of persons and we certainly want to keep a close surveillance of these prescribed classes of persons.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In regard to financial counselling where defaulters are required to attend compulsory counselling sessions, are there current figures to show how many defaulters on average we have annually?&nbsp; And what proportions subsequently comply?&nbsp; Certainly we need to look for more efficient ways to handle and track these cases down as making it compulsory is one step.&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister if he is able to update the House on the SCWO's (the Singapore Council of Woman Organisations) plan to commence maintenance support central which was to offer a one-stop assistance providing legal advice, financial and family counselling, Credit Bureau reporting, childcare needs, housing needs advice, and follow-up assistance.&nbsp; This appears to be a feasible suggestion as it would be helpful and time-saving for the single parent who has to look after children, negotiate time for various appointments pertaining to all the various issues they have to handle.&nbsp; Will the Ministry consider supporting this?<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 2062<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, Mr Speaker, pertaining to clause 6 on the new enforcement measures for defaulters; it will only work well if there is buy-in from all parties concerned whereby they also need to support Credit Bureau reporting.&nbsp; The Ministry would need to consider doing more targeted publicity together with the NGOs and VWOs working in this area to help create awareness on this area.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also finally like to know what if the reverse occurs, that is, husbands have to claim maintenance from their wives.&nbsp; And in this day and age, I think you would agree with me it is not unlikely to happen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1996 when this Bill was last debated, it was put forth to the Select Committee to have this matter considered.&nbsp; The decision at that time was \"the Committee notes that women have advanced over the years; however, the Committee also notes that there is still some disparity though a decreasing one between most men and women.&nbsp; As such, the Committee agrees that it may not be timely to introduce such a provision now.\"&nbsp; We have moved on, Sir, 14 years to be exact; can I ask the Minister if he feels we are ready now to include a clause for the men?&nbsp; I feel this is now necessary so that it can be invoked in the event it becomes necessary and relevant on a case by case consideration.&nbsp; I do not, however, Sir, support changing the name of this Bill from the Women's Charter to the Family Charter as has been suggested by some quarters.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the consideration to be given to the suggestions I have made, Sir, I support the Amendment Bill.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

To streamline them, I support the proposal for the establishment of an administrative centre for maintenance payments to help others trapped in the nightmare of unpaid maintenance payments.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to specific enforcement measures, the Bill provides for the Court to order recalcitrant men to provide a banker&rsquo;s guarantee (BG) but the Bill can go one step further to help the claimant by requiring the defaulter to furnish a second BG&nbsp;&ndash; without the need for a fresh Court order.&nbsp; This second BG serves as a replacement the instant a claimant is forced to present an existing BG to the bank.&nbsp; That a woman has to turn to the Court which then orders that a BG be furnished to her indicates&nbsp;the likelihood of another default in maintenance payments by the former spouse is higher than in cases in which a BG is not issued in the first place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the subject of community work orders, I recognise that they have nuisance value when applied to defaulters in Singapore who have money in the bank but who do not pay up. Yet, unless the defaulter is extremely wealthy, I would say that late interest penalties &ndash; which can hit the pocket &ndash; serve as a bigger deterrent than community service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge too that remuneration be considered for defaulters who are financially strapped but the money paid to the defaulter goes directly to the claimants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasks that are suited to this scheme include those of litter warden and utilities metre reading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for allowing arrears reports to be lodged with a Credit Bureau, I note that the Bill is silent as to when the black mark is to be removed against the defaulter once he makes good the arrears.&nbsp; To be even-handed, the Bill should stipulate that any reporting to a Credit<p align=left>Column: 2064<p>Bureau be made within a specified period of the date of the relevant Court order.&nbsp; This will limit room for mischief on the part of&nbsp;disgruntled claimant who files the Credit Bureau report even after maintenance payments are no longer in arrears.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am heartened that the Bill provides for mandatory post-filing counselling for couples with children. I would like to suggest that, instead of allowing for judicial discretion in this, the counselling sessions be made mandatory. A time period should be stipulated within which couples should present themselves at these sessions. The sooner these are scheduled, the better. The aim is to minimise acrimony, sharpen the couple&rsquo;s awareness of the toll that divorce can have on their children and to reinforce to the couple that they are still responsible for their children, whichever side has custody of the kids when they split up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill imposes an obligation on re-marrying divorcees to declare maintenance debts although this should be information which the re-marrying divorcee should volunteer as part of his duties to his new bride without the law having to step in. But if the law has to do the prodding, then it should go all the way where the divorcee should be required to declare the existence of any maintenance order&nbsp;&ndash; not just arrears in maintenance payments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The maintenance and custody obligations of the divorcee can be discussed at pre-marriage counselling sessions. These sessions should be attended by the divorcee together with his new prospective spouse. Sir, as these declarations do make an impact on individuals and families and especially on <p align=left>Column: 2065<p>the low-income families, would the Ministry consider punitive measures against those who make false declarations?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to add to the recommendations for pre-marriage counselling targets to include cases where the groom is Singaporean and the bride, a non-English-speaking foreigner. The counselling should be extended to Singaporean women and their prospective foreign husbands who do not speak English. As globalisation intensifies, there would be several such cases of Singaporean women marrying men from other countries. These foreign men need help to assimilate too, particularly into their new extended family and society. Sir, I would like to ask the Ministry what programmes does the Ministry have which help ensure such assimilation?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I share the view of&nbsp;my colleague before me.&nbsp;Times have changed and these days we do find role reversals where the woman brings home the bacon while the man stays home as house husband. In such a case, when the couple divorces, the man deserves consideration to receive maintenance payments. Sir, I would like to know the Ministry&rsquo;s stand on this matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note,&nbsp;I support the Amendment Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>5.03 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Sir, I support this Bill. I wish to touch on aspects of the Bill governing divorce and ancillary matters.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not practise matrimonial law. Frankly, I have little stomach for it.&nbsp;Many years ago, a man came to see me about getting a divorce. He said his wife was <p align=left>Column: 2066<p>mad and had attacked him a few times with a pair of scissors. He could no longer live with her because he feared for his life. He wanted to know whether their HDB flat would be sold and how much he would get. I asked whether they had children, and he said one young son. I asked what provisions he was making for the child, and he said that his wife could take care&nbsp;of the child. I said, \"I thought&nbsp;your wife was mad\", and he said, \"Well, she is not that mad.\"&nbsp;So, it was really about him cashing out and moving on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Divorce is difficult, and particularly painful when young children are involved. But if two people decide that they do not want to stay married, then that is their decision to make.&nbsp;Our laws should facilitate a smooth and equitable separation. However, different considerations should apply where one spouse is financially dependent on the other, and particularly where young children are involved. Children should not have to suffer for their parents' decisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have encountered a number of cases at the Meet-the-People Session (MPS) where one divorced parent, almost always the mother, appeals for a rental flat for herself and her young children. Usually, the matrimonial home is sold following the divorce and the mother has no ability to buy another home. While a rental or interim housing is usually found for them, the question is why no provision was made for the children in the first place before the divorce was allowed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our laws should make clear that the decision to divorce does not just involve religious, moral, social or emotional considerations, but will have direct and severe financial and practical consequences. Parents, whether divorced or not, should not be allowed to shirk their responsibilities, particularly towards their children.&nbsp;The majority of parents are responsible, but there&nbsp;is a good number who are not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2067<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill makes an attempt to give the law more teeth in enforcing maintenance orders. These are useful.&nbsp; But allow me to make some observations.&nbsp;The amendment to allow community-based sentences makes sense. It is of little use to the applicant if the ex-spouse loses his job or income because he is sent to jail.&nbsp;We should also consider expanding the types of orders and sanctions to encourage the errant spouse to try harder to meet his obligations. In the UK, for example, the defaulting party may be required to surrender his travel papers or driving licence, or even&nbsp;have a curfew order slapped on him. What will work will depend on the facts, and we should give our judges a wider discretion to make effective orders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendment to allow the Court to order a spouse to furnish a bank guarantee is less helpful.&nbsp;Banks will require an applicant to furnish security before issuing the guarantee, which will be a stumbling block for many. It may also create more problems as parties may dispute over the terms of the guarantee and which will give rise to more litigation, where calls on the guarantee are made wrongly or are challenged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, more importantly, we need to take a step back and rationalise the system so that maintenance issues can be dealt with simply and expeditiously, and no party can frustrate the process by employing delaying and other tactics.&nbsp;However one looks at it, the enforcement of maintenance orders is tedious and can be discouraging. Many applicants are women with little financial resources. Usually, they cannot afford a lawyer. They will typically be juggling work and raising their children, and can ill afford time to keep going to Court when their ex-husbands do not keep up with payments.&nbsp;Even after an application is filed, the hearing may be adjourned because parties will ask for time to file affidavits or get information. Many are<p align=left>Column: 2068<p>litigants in person, and so the Courts will likely give them more time&nbsp;or the benefit of the doubt. Even after an application is resolved, she will have to file another application if there is another default, and the process goes on and on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Family Courts, with its heavy workload and adherence to strict and formal procedure, may not be best suited to deal with matters of maintenance. I understand that the Government has rejected suggestions to set up an agency to handle maintenance payments and defaults.&nbsp;The reasons given include the fear that the State may over time be required to take over basic family responsibilities; and that more resources may be expended chasing what is ultimately secured.&nbsp;This response is not persuasive, particularly as we have set up a whole regime to allow parents to apply for maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Substantial resources are currently being undertaken at&nbsp;the Family Court, including the time of District Judges in dealing with maintenance application.&nbsp;This is unnecessary as determining the quantum of maintenance is almost always not a legal exercise. It turns on matters such as the earnings, needs, financial obligations and lifestyles of the parties.&nbsp;The exercise is really no different from the maintenance of parents, for which we have set up special tribunal to deal with claims fairly and expeditiously. There is no rationale for treating the obligation to maintain spouses and children differently.&nbsp;Indeed, the number of maintenance claims for wives and children easily exceed those for parents, making the need for a special body even more relevant. Like the Parents&rsquo; Tribunal, procedures can be simplified and the agency given the power to get information. This would relieve the applicant of the need to investigate the spouse&rsquo;s claims or file affidavits, and result in quicker and more equitable orders.&nbsp;Would the Minister consider <p align=left>Column: 2069<p>setting up such an agency to deal with maintenance issues?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our efforts should also begin upstream. I therefore support the move to require marriage preparation courses for some. A number of religious organisations have had this for some time. Could the Minister&nbsp;tell us if any prescribed classes have been identified, other than for minors and divorcees? Further, would&nbsp;there&nbsp;be a need to undergo such courses if the couple has already attended one conducted by their own religious groups? If not, how will MCYS ensure that such courses will meet required standards?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, subsequent to the amendments to the Women&rsquo;s Charter in 1996, our Courts are given a broad discretion in respect of the division of matrimonial assets and to take into consideration the needs of the children.&nbsp;This includes the power to defer the sale of the matrimonial property or to refuse a divorce order in the absence of a proper plan for the children.&nbsp;Currently, divorcing parties are required to file parenting plans to deal with the welfare of the child after the divorce. However, I understand from my friends who practise matrimonial law that such plans are often treated as a form-filling exercise, lacking in detail or given little weight. It is troubling to come across cases where the needs of the children have not been adequately taken care of, particularly their housing needs.&nbsp;It is even more troubling that one parent is allowed to marry again and start a new family when the needs of his first family remain unresolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Divorce should not be an opportunity to cash out or get out, with the welfare of the children treated as an ancillary matter, like the division of property. Parents must accept that their own rights should become secondary to their child&rsquo;s. They should not be entitled to exit a marriage <p align=left>Column: 2070<p>until there is a comprehensive binding and properly documented plan to take care of housing, schooling and other needs of the children until they turn 18 or 21.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask the Ministry to conduct a review of matrimonial cases to determine whether they are being dealt with in a manner consistent with its policies and objectives, and to enact more effective rules to improve outcomes for children.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>5.11 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade):</B> Sir, let me declare my interest as a practising family lawyer.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill to amend the Women's Charter. In particular, I support the proposal to make it mandatory for certain classes of people to attend marriage preparation courses.&nbsp;Given the increasing number of divorces in Singapore, as alluded to by Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, I will even advocate that marriage preparation courses be made mandatory for all couples who wish to get married. They can have a better idea of what to expect in a marriage. They can understand that the concept of \"living happily ever after\" is a fairytale concept and that it requires a lot of effort, mutual give and take to keep a marriage healthy. However, may I ask the Minister how does the Ministry intend to monitor this if the parties decide to register their marriage out of Singapore?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also ask the Minister to clarify clause 6 of the Bill. Sir, I support the proposal to offer other sentencing options for a person who defaults in paying maintenance pursuant to a maintenance order. In particular, I support this proposal to allow the Court to order the person to provide security against future default. In my view, this will help to ensure less default, especially among recalcitrant&nbsp;defaulters&nbsp;who are able to pay, but unwilling to pay despite the maintenance order.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2071<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am, however, concerned about clause 6(b)(f) that allows the Court to make a community service order in lieu of other orders. I am worried that this may be seen as a soft option for the Judges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, if&nbsp;the defaulter is an unwilling party to pay, he will be usually unwilling to perform such a community service order.&nbsp;This&nbsp;will make a mockery of community service where such defaulters do their community service grudgingly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir,&nbsp;I understand many&nbsp;recalcitrant maintenance defaulters do make&nbsp;payment when threatened&nbsp;with a&nbsp;jail term. By allowing this softer option,&nbsp;would Judges take the easier route or sentencing&nbsp;defaulters to perform community service instead?&nbsp;How about the arrears&nbsp;of maintenance? If arrears remain unpaid, any sentence of community service is&nbsp;of cold comfort to the&nbsp;party waiting for&nbsp;payment of the&nbsp;maintenance, especially if there are children involved. Not only do they not receive&nbsp;payment of the maintenance, they are sometimes not eligible to apply&nbsp;for financial aid because of this imputed&nbsp;income that they are supposed to have received&nbsp;through the maintenance. In some cases, they&nbsp;may even have to pay taxes on the maintenance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am not unsympathetic to parties who default in payment of&nbsp;maintenance due to financial difficulties. However, for&nbsp;any party who faces financial difficulties&nbsp;due to job loss, medical crisis, or circumstances beyond control, then&nbsp;in such a situation, the&nbsp;Court should advise them that they should apply for variation&nbsp;of the maintenance order, instead of frequently disobeying a&nbsp;Court order.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next,&nbsp;Sir, allow me to seek a clarification on&nbsp;clause 5 of the Bill. Having&nbsp;practised as a family lawyer, I notice that mediation and counselling is not the&nbsp;silver bullet that would solve disputes&nbsp;between<p align=left>Column: 2072<p>spouses.&nbsp; Frequently, parties ordered to attend counselling are unwilling to do so. Or one party goes for the counselling with the mindset that he or she is the aggrieved&nbsp;party, and the other party is the wrong party. And&nbsp;that person&nbsp;would frequently insist that the counsellor orders the spouse to follow his&nbsp;or her wishes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Minister what is the intent of this&nbsp;clause 5? Do we have enough&nbsp;experienced counsellors who&nbsp;could help&nbsp;parties see reason when they have disputes about their children? For example, where I say the father behaves violently towards his&nbsp;wife, he then insists that his children visits him regularly. How&nbsp;is the councellor expected to persuade the children to want to see the father in the face of extreme violence in their&nbsp;presence? Sir, what are the&nbsp;success statistics from the past cases which have gone for counselling? Does the counsellor know what power he has and what he is able to do? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What if one party repeatedly fails to attend the counselling?&nbsp; If cost is awarded, how does a non-defaulting party expect this cost to be paid?&nbsp; My understanding is that the Court normally awards nominal cost of between $200 and $300.&nbsp; No litigant would actually incur further expenses just to enforce payment of nominal cost.&nbsp; Is there any other practical way to enforce order of cost against a defaulting party?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, what are the options for the Judge if counselling or mediation is not successful?&nbsp; Currently, many lawyers feel that the Court bends over backwards to help parties seek an amicable resolution of the matter.&nbsp; However, this may cause delay in the closure of a painful period in the parties' lives.&nbsp; Both parties are inconvenienced time and again because of the Court's desire to send them for repeated counselling when clearly this will not be productive.&nbsp; Children are also sometimes ordered to attend counselling when they are unwilling to do so.&nbsp; Are there any guidelines for the Courts as to<p align=left>Column: 2073<p>the minimum number of attempts at counselling before the Court makes an appropriation order regarding access or custody of the children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For cases involving children, are the Courts empowered to order unsuccessful litigants not to voice his or her unhappiness through emails or over the Internet?&nbsp; Sir, I notice that this is becoming quite a recurrent practice where parties resort to writing emails to various Ministers, Prime Minister, MPs, and so on, voicing their side of the story or they come out onto Internet to tell their side of the story.&nbsp; And, invariably, this embarrasses the spouse and many a time the children involved.&nbsp; How does the law protect the innocent party against abuse over the Internet?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.17 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Ellen Lee:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as a family law practitioner, I applaud the slew of measures introduced in this Women&rsquo;s Charter (Amendment) Bill. Most family law practitioners,&nbsp;Family Service Centres&rsquo; social workers and members of the women's organisations that I have spoken to like the enhancement on enforcement of maintenance orders which is much needed to protect the claimant who, inevitably, is a single mum struggling to maintain her job and to take care of her children.&nbsp; However, there is a defect which we thought should have been made good. Most times, employers do not allow the claimant to take unpaid leave and when she does, she also has to incur costs to go to the Family Court repeatedly to enforce payments in arrears.&nbsp; Usually, it is these multiple trips to the Family Court that wear down the claimant and cause her to forego her right to claim maintenance for herself and her children as provided for in the Court Order. As <p align=left>Column: 2074<p>such, we are disappointed to note that the current changes do not seem to make it any easier for the claimant by dispensing with the requirement that she has to go to the Court for enforcement.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One possible solution is for the Government to consider the establishment of a central body to administer maintenance payments and to facilitate the collection of outstanding payments, with powers to access information from Government databases, similar to the powers given in the recent amendments to the Maintenance of Parents (Amendment) Act.&nbsp; There are several models of such agencies in the world, some of which have been very effective in administering the collection of arrears. For example, the British Columbia Family Enforcement Programme is an opt-in system which appears to be highly effective. The users do not seem to have to pay an agency fee whilst the agency is funded by fees collected from the defaulters. The agency administering the programme does not only administer and collect claims. Where the default is due to the defaulter being out of a job or facing some short-term financial crisis, the agency can facilitate parties to arrive at arrangements where&nbsp;payments are temporarily restructured to give the defaulter some flexibility in making payments. Thus, the Court Order remains intact but the payment schedule is adjusted to provide flexibility. The British Columbia government has outsourced the debt collection and administration functions to the private sector.&nbsp; It is thus recommended that the Women&rsquo;s Charter could be amended to impose late interest on maintenance arrears or, alternatively, that the Court can be empowered to impose late payment interest. This will serve as an incentive for punctual payment and also compensate the claimant for the delay in payments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would like to repeat what I have asked for during the COS debate on <p align=left>Column: 2075<p>MCYS in 2010 where I urged the Government to consider renaming the Women&rsquo;s Charter,&nbsp;the \"Family Charter\".&nbsp; The Women&rsquo;s Charter contains the rights and responsibilities of the parties to a marriage and it covers every conceivable aspect of marital and family law&nbsp;&ndash; registration and dissolution of marriages, division of matrimonial assets, maintenance provisions and the welfare of children and protection from family violence.&nbsp; The \"Family Charter\" is a more accurate and appropriate name for this important piece of legislation.&nbsp; The name \"Women's Charter\" is no longer significant in today&rsquo;s Singapore as it was when it was introduced in 1961. It misleads by giving the impression that women are solely or primarily responsible for the family, which is not what the Women's Charter is. It also gives the impression that it is a statute that protects wives against husbands and that husbands have fewer rights than wives in Singapore.&nbsp; In the same vein, it gives the impression that it is the only legislation which offers legal protection to women.&nbsp; The change of the name to \"Family Charter\" will remove these widely held misconceptions, in particular, the inaccurate impression that family law favours wives over husbands and women over men. It does a disservice to the society and families in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the same token, husbands are not entitled to apply for maintenance from their wives under the Women&rsquo;s Charter. The amendments do not change this position.&nbsp; I urge again that this position be changed to allow husbands the right to apply for maintenance in appropriate cases. For a start, it could be confined to situations where the husband is sick or incapacitated and cannot work at all and he has to rely on his wife for a living, but he is not receiving any financial help at all from a wife who can well afford to give him some money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction of a marriage preparatory course is a good start to give <p align=left>Column: 2076<p>intended spouses a right perspective of marriage and how to sustain it for better or for worst and, more importantly, for life. However, these courses should be made mandatory for the Singapore citizen and&nbsp;non-Singapore citizen couples in all the four official languages.&nbsp; This will help to ensure that the non-citizen spouses are properly integrated into the Singaporean culture and way of life and that a non-citizen applicant is fully aware of what their immigration status will be when they marry a Singapore citizen. This will also help the Singapore citizen and the non-citizen parties to better understand each other's expectations in marriage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

With your permission, Sir, I would like to focus my comments on the proposals relating to divorce.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new section 12A highlights the importance of marriage preparation courses for those who are deemed to be at high risk for divorce. For this group, the Amendment Bill specifies that they must attend compulsory marriage preparation classes before the marriage licence can be issued.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no issue with the emphasis on marriage preparation courses.&nbsp; Based on research I conducted in Singapore on marriage and divorce, there is evidence that suggest the significance of marriage preparation in sustaining marriages&nbsp;&ndash; both the formal courses as well as through informal preparation that invokes discourses with social support networks.&nbsp; It is not easy to nurture and sustain a<p align=left>Column: 2077<p>happy marriage. As partners progress through life cycle, expectations of couple-hood will change with the emerging needs of the persons involved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we expect of marriage in the initial stages of courtship will be quite different when we face the challenges of parenthood.&nbsp; And our demands of our spouses will again be quite different as we age together.&nbsp;&nbsp; An effective marriage preparation programme will help married couples anticipate these challenges and equip them with the skills to navigate through the demands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, on the discourse of marriage preparation, I have two queries for the Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, does the Minister have plans to develop a framework that will guide the development of marriage preparation courses?&nbsp; Without a framework for assessing quality and validation, it will be difficult to differentiate effective programmes from the rest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The paradox of familiarity that is often associated with discourses relating to the family gives the illusion that marriage and family issues can be addressed by anyone, just because they are familiar topics in our everyday lives.&nbsp; But that is indeed a misperception.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that this Amendment Bill seeks to make attendance at marriage preparation courses compulsory for specified high-risk groups, it is essential and critical that we have in place&nbsp;clear guidelines on what must be expected in an effective marriage preparation course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second query concerns the existing marriage preparation programmes. How are these currently evaluated and do we have a database that documents which programmes have a higher success rate in<p align=left>Column: 2078<p>sustaining marriage?&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, will the Minister consider setting up a comprehensive database that tracks outcomes of marriages that have gone through the respective courses?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more serious concern I have with section 12A is on the definition of who is at risk for divorce.&nbsp; While I appreciate the need for minors to attend compulsory marriage preparation courses to raise their awareness of the demands of marriage and to equip them with life skills that will help sustain the marital union, I disagree that we should place divorcees in the same category.&nbsp; I feel strongly that if we make it compulsory for divorcees to attend marriage preparation courses, we will end up negatively stigmatising both the divorcees as well as marriage preparation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sociological research on divorce highlights many factors that may trigger marriage dissolution.&nbsp; I do not agree that there is sufficient evidence for us to tag a person who has to endure a failed marriage as being at higher risk for divorce in&nbsp;subsequent unions.&nbsp; That would not be a fair assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, remarriage rates in Singapore&nbsp;are still relatively low, and there is insufficient data to suggest that divorcees suffer a higher rate of divorce in their subsequent marriages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I appeal to the Minister to reconsider making marriage preparation compulsory for those who&nbsp;had suffered a failed marriage. Divorce is a very painful process for all involved.&nbsp; We should not make it harder for these individuals when they seek to reconstitute a happy family.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, I suggest that we strongly encourage all couples to attend marriage preparation before they enter the marital union formally.&nbsp; But before we can do that, we should have in place a comprehensive framework that guides what effective marriage preparation courses must cover.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2079<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My final concern is with section 50 of the Bill, which specifies compulsory mediation before divorce where children are involved.&nbsp; While I strongly support mediation and other measures that might avert marriage dissolution, I wonder if mediation at this late stage where irreconcilable differences may have already set in may be too late.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, may I ask the Minister if mediation is already in place now for divorce petitions? If so, can the Minister share with us data on the number of petitions for divorce that were withdrawn after successful mediation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the Minister consider putting in place a system that allows individuals involved to seek mandatory marriage counselling for the family unit when one party fears that the marriage is not progressing well?&nbsp;&nbsp; And to allow children of unhappy marriages to be eligible petitioners for mandatory counselling for their family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, there are many trapped in unhappy marriages and who are in need of help and guidance&nbsp;but they do not know where to turn to for help.&nbsp; Short of contacting a lawyer, these individuals sometimes have no one else to turn to. Will the Minister consider setting up a marriage centre where families can contact for help on marriage-related issues?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Sir, for your kind attention.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Audrey Wong Wai Yen:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;I&nbsp; rise&nbsp;in support of this Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me place on record my thanks to the Ministry for the extensive public consultations before proposing the Bill.&nbsp; I am particularly supportive of the additional mechanisms in enforcing maintenance orders and the provision for persons to apply for financial relief after foreign divorce proceedings, subject to&nbsp;certain conditions.&nbsp; This latter provision, <p align=left>Column: 2080<p>like many of the amendments, recognises the changing reality of Singapore society.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from&nbsp;the increasing number of marriages&nbsp;between Singapore citizens and foreigners, many Singaporeans today also live and work abroad and might get married or separated abroad.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I applaud the tightened measures on payment of maintenance orders that include giving powers to the Courts to order community service for defaulters, requiring defaulters to post a bank guarantee against future defaults, credit bureau reporting and requiring divorcees re-entering into marriage to declare any arrears in maintenance.&nbsp; For this last amendment, I would like to ask if it might actually make sense, in fact, to require the divorcee to declare that he is under a maintenance order rather than only declaring his arrears.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the amended Bill certainly puts more teeth into the enforcement of maintenance orders,&nbsp;in light of the increase in the number of applications for enforcement&nbsp;&ndash; an increase of 10% between 2008 and 2009&nbsp;&ndash; with a total of 3,585 such cases in 2009 alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we recognise the need to protect women and children who might suffer if the husband defaults on maintenance, there should also be a measure of fairness for those defaulters who might have genuine financial difficulty.&nbsp; So, for example, in the event of a defaulter who is reported to the credit bureau, if he regains his financial footing, there should be a streamlined process for him to inform the credit bureau and for the credit rating to be re-adjusted as quickly as possible.&nbsp; In addition, the attachment of earnings orders that are served on the defaulters' employers could be done in a discreet manner so that the person's employment is not jeopardised.&nbsp; Because if this person loses his job, the children that he is supposed to maintain are the ones who will suffer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2081<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turn now to some questions for clarification.&nbsp; First, regarding the requirement for certain categories of persons to attend a marriage preparation course.&nbsp; I hope the Minister can clarify who falls under this class of persons.&nbsp; Will this include foreign spouses&nbsp;&ndash; non-Singaporean citizens who are not fluent in Singapore's main languages or familiar with our culture&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;as some of these may enter into marriage with a Singaporean through the auspices of a matchmaking agency?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marriages between Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans are increasing today.&nbsp; The report by the National&nbsp;Population Secretariat&nbsp;in 2009&nbsp;indicated that in 2008, four in&nbsp;10 marriages involving Singapore citizens are between a Singaporean and a non-Singaporean.&nbsp; Thirty percent of citizen births involve a non-Singaporean parent.&nbsp; There are more local men now choosing foreign brides through matchmaking agencies; and unfortunately these women can be put into vulnerable situations.&nbsp; For instance, they are ineligible&nbsp;for permanent residency and their husbands could send them back and cancel their social visit passes if the marriage does not work, thus separating them from their children.&nbsp; I understand that the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) has reported that its helpline has seen a number of such cases where the women were not even aware that they were not eligible for permanent residency.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry will seek further means to improve the situation for these women and to ensure the integration of non-Singaporean spouses into our society.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question of who should be prescribed to attend a marriage preparation course is very sensitive because it means effectively State intervention into people's private lives and private decisions.&nbsp; I am concerned that this could give rise to suggestions of <p align=left>Column: 2082<p>discrimination against some of the Singapore population who may feel offended or stigmatised because the State might declare them, essentially, as not being ready for marriage.&nbsp; As Assoc. Prof. Paulin&nbsp;Straughan has mentioned, for divorcees, it could end up with them feeling stigmatised if they are asked to attend marriage preparation courses prior to re-marriage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On what grounds would a couple be selected to attend these courses?&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the requirement for attending the marriage preparation course extend to couples marrying under Muslim law?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, religious groups already offer marriage preparation courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;As other Members have already expressed, there are concerns about how this would be coordinated with the MCYS' own programmes.&nbsp; Will there be common guidelines or frameworks for all these marriage preparation courses?&nbsp; What would be the content and who would be the ones delivering these programmes?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask for clarification on section 50 about Court-mandated mediation or counselling for the couple or family.&nbsp; I presume this is to ensure that children should be protected.&nbsp; However, the Act is not very clear as to the purpose of the mediation or counselling.&nbsp; At this stage, it is clearly too late to require the couple to go for reconciliation as divorce proceedings are already in motion.&nbsp; It would be useful to spell out the guidelines on when such counselling or mediation sessions will be mandated.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mr Lim Biow Chuan has also reminded us in a sobering manner, mediation and counselling is not a magic pill, and there are many reasons&nbsp;why people may choose not to go for counselling even if they are required by the Courts to go for it.&nbsp; I would like to suggest that perhaps it might be useful for the Courts or the MCYS to refer couples&nbsp;with children who are divorcing to&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2083<p>Family Service Centres, for instance, or to the children's schools so that the situation can be continually monitored as the children go through this painful process.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My final question concerns section 71B which gives the Court the power to order a maintenance defaulter to attend financial counselling.&nbsp; The Act does not specify what the consequences will be if he does not attend the counselling and how&nbsp;the order will be enforced.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turn now to the call by some members of the public requesting the Ministry to set up an authority or central body to facilitate the claims and payments for maintenance orders.&nbsp; As other Members of the House have pointed out, it takes time to apply to the Courts to enforce payments and as many claimants affected by this are less educated, are struggling financially and often need to work long hours as well as look after the children, it is difficult for them to keep going back to the Courts.&nbsp; I applaud the MCYS and the Courts' efforts in setting up new measures to facilitate the enforcement.&nbsp; However, I would urge the Ministry to continue to streamline the legal procedures and to help these claimants.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Women's Charter first enacted in 1961 was certainly a ground-breaking piece of legislation giving protection to women and children and is the basis of our Family Law.&nbsp; It has been amended as society changed.&nbsp; The present amendments, I believe, reflect a balanced and logical approach to the realities of Singapore today, placing the needs of the most vulnerable segment of our society at its heart.&nbsp; I know men and women who have separated or divorced and understand how painful it is even for those without children.&nbsp; And I believe that our legislation constantly seeks to address the issues that surface as the situation in Singapore changes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2084<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee has proposed that the Women's Charter be renamed the \"Family Charter\".&nbsp; The term \"Women's Charter\" could give the impression that the Bill is about conferring more rights on women and might give the mistaken impression that women have more rights than men when it comes to ending the marriage and maintenance.&nbsp; However, in fact, the Women's Charter is a Family Charter which affirms the family as the basis of our social structure yet seeks to ensure fair treatment of those who might be most badly affected when families break down, ie, women who are financially dependent on their husbands, women who are the primary caregivers of the children and the children who have the rights to a nurturing and secure environment as they grow up.&nbsp; I will not call for the Women's Charter to be so renamed as the Family Charter as I believe there is still a role for a Bill that specifically mentions women even in today's Singapore.&nbsp; However, as a Bill that protects the family and especially the rights of children, the Women's Charter continues to be an extremely important piece of legislation for our society, and I thank the MCYS Minister for proposing the amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.40 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, I intend to take both Bills through the House today.&nbsp; So, I hope you will forgive me if I rush through the proceedings.&nbsp; I may not be able to answer every query but I assure&nbsp;Members that&nbsp;my staff and I will provide answers to each and every specific question that&nbsp;they have raised in the course of this debate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, let me say I am very heartened by&nbsp;Members' reasoned, logical and persuasive arguments. I am heartened <p align=left>Column: 2085<p>because it has shown that we are moving in the right direction, although I suspect many of you wish we move faster, and maybe the pace is not to your satisfaction.&nbsp; But we are moving in the right direction.&nbsp; Let me get down now to the specifics.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been&nbsp;many queries about&nbsp;the marriage preparation courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence from overseas research, as well as our own&nbsp;local experience, have suggested that these programmes are indeed helpful in strengthening marriages.&nbsp; We conducted a survey in 2006 of 800 people, 97% of them who have&nbsp;attended marriage preparation programmes reportedly found them useful.&nbsp; Also, the Muslim community has expanded marriage preparation courses for minors since 2007.&nbsp; They set up two INSPIRASI centres.&nbsp;&nbsp;This measure appears to&nbsp;have borne fruit, as divorces resulting from Muslim minor marriages have fallen by about&nbsp;15% from 2007 to 2009, and, in fact, by one-third from 2003.&nbsp; The present proposal seeks to extend this practice to civil marriages that have a higher risk of divorce.&nbsp; As there is already a good system in place for Muslim couples, there is no need to amend the Administration of Muslim Law Act in order to require marriage preparation for Muslim marriages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we have also been very careful.&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;Assoc Prof.&nbsp;Straughan has said, before we&nbsp;even embark on the suggestion of mandatory marriage preparation for everyone, we have to be very clear first, who will benefit, then&nbsp;the quality of the providers.&nbsp; And that is why I have moved very, very carefully and in a very slow way.&nbsp; So we have only, for a start, confined ourselves to marriages involving minors because this is one area where we have clear evidence that this is a group that is more at risk and this is a group for whom intervention makes a <p align=left>Column: 2086<p>difference.&nbsp; As evidence surfaces for other groups, we can then consider it in the future, but I am not willing to rush into this. &nbsp;I will take Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Straughan&rsquo;s point that we must accumulate the data and the evidence before we make further moves in this area.&nbsp; Similarly, I do not intend to apply this requirement for marriage preparation to marriages involving divorcees, or to foreign brides or foreign grooms, until we can better ascertain the risk profiles for these different categories of couples.&nbsp; It is also neither necessary nor feasible to mandate the programme for all couples or for us to track those who marry overseas for attendance for marriage courses.&nbsp; What we will do, however,&nbsp;is that we will certainly be prepared to exercise more flexibility and to also work with both secular as well as religious organisations which are providing such marriage preparation courses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a suggestion that we needed to have&nbsp;a marriage centre to provide help on marriage-related issues.&nbsp; Well, I am&nbsp;very pleased to tell&nbsp;Members that, in fact, the National Family Council set up Marriage Central two years ago.&nbsp; This is a one-stop resource point to promote strong, healthy and happy marriages. Marriage Central provides easy access to&nbsp;a whole slew of marriage-related programmes and resources through various platforms both in cyberspace as well as&nbsp;in real physical space.&nbsp; The physical space is located at the Woodlands and Jurong Regional Libraries.&nbsp; I would encourage couples who seek help on marriage-related issues to approach Marriage Central.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also concern expressed by Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Straughan and Ms Wong about the timing and effectiveness of the requirement for divorcing couples with children to attend counselling or mediation at the Court.&nbsp; Let me be very explicit here and clarify that the primary intent of this measure is to<p align=left>Column: 2087<p>mitigate the impact of the divorce on the children.&nbsp; It is not about reversing the couple&rsquo;s decision to divorce or to help them resolve their personal problems or to restore their marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp;If that happens, that is an additional bonus but that is not the main intent.&nbsp; In fact, the efforts to save the marriage are better pursued upstream through marriage preparation and enrichment programmes and, also, as I alluded to earlier, by providing accessible touch points such as&nbsp;Marriage Central.&nbsp;&nbsp;But couples who have already filed for divorce are unlikely to benefit from&nbsp;mandatory counselling if one or both parties are unwilling to undergo counselling in order to improve the relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the proposed measure is simply to ensure, indeed to insist, that parents put their children's interests ahead of the conflict that they have as a couple and that they must work out, hopefully amiably, the issues of custody maintenance and division of assets, particularly in respect of their children.&nbsp; I agree totally with Mr Hri Kumar that a parenting plan should not be a paper exercise.&nbsp; It is not a form-filling exercise but it should reflect a joint commitment by both partners to put the interests of their children first.&nbsp; Currently, Court statistics indicate that&nbsp;a significant proportion of the submitted Parenting Plans are proposed&nbsp;but have not been agreed upon.&nbsp; I think that was what Mr Hri Kumar was alluding to.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aim, then, is to address this by ensuring that both parties come to an agreement on effective, workable and practical parenting and care arrangements for the children under the guidance of trained mediators and counsellors who are familiar with the legal, emotional and psychological dimensions of the custody dispute.&nbsp; This measure will be implemented in stages because we need to make sure that we have adequate numbers of trained and qualified counsellors and mediators.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2088<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, we still felt that it is important for the Court to retain the discretion to waive the requirement&nbsp;for special cases where counselling or mediation may not be in the interest of all parties, such as those involving family violence or abuse.&nbsp; To address Mr Lim's concern that an uncooperative party may try to stay the divorce proceedings by not attending the requisite mediation or counselling, the proposed provisions empower the Court to exercise appropriate discretion against non-compliant parties.&nbsp; For instance, the non-compliant party may be ordered to pay a reasonable amount in costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua, quite rightly, has expressed her sympathy for children who are affected by their parents' divorce, and it is obviously not the fault of the children.&nbsp; However, I am afraid that I still cannot agree to the Member's repeated calls for mandatory counselling for children because I believe that it is better to maintain the current arrangement where the Courts have the discretion to refer the children for counselling on a case-by-case basis, based&nbsp;on the Judge's&nbsp;assessment.&nbsp; Each family and each divorce is unique, and in this House, as we formulate legislation, we need to be careful&nbsp;to retain enough flexibility and discretion in the hands of Judges who are dealing with each family and each case, rather than for us to succumb to the temptation to hardwire all our prescriptions into the resolution of complicated family disputes.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would still maintain the position that I would rather leave this question in the hands of the Family Court Judges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall now move on to the comments on the measures and enhanced enforcement of maintenance orders.&nbsp; Mr Kumar, Mdm Phua, Mdm Ho and Ms Lee have all suggested additional sanctions against maintenance defaulters and, indeed, there were many other<p align=left>Column: 2089<p>suggestions on members of the public as well; including confiscating travel documents, imposing curfews, imposing interests&nbsp;for late payments and a plethora of other uncomfortable sanctions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest, my Ministry studied each suggestion very carefully, including suggestions like confiscating handphones and revoking driving licences.&nbsp; But we decided not to embark on this.&nbsp; We felt that many of these suggestions were difficult to enforce fairly and the sanctions&nbsp;bore little nexus to the offence itself which is&nbsp;not paying the maintenance arrears.&nbsp; However, you noticed that in this Act, we have introduced new sanctions.&nbsp; These new sanctions include things like community service orders, the requirement to declare maintenance debts before remarrying, the imposition of banker's guarantees on defaulters and&nbsp;the reporting to credit bureaus.&nbsp; These are incremental measures.&nbsp; Let us see and wait to measure&nbsp;the impact of these measures before contemplating even more onerous sanctions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was much discussion on community service orders.&nbsp; I want to emphasise that it is not meant to be a soft option.&nbsp; It is meant to give Judges a wider menu of deterrent sentences which they can impose in order to encourage appropriate behaviour by the defaulters.&nbsp; The defaulters who are required to perform community service are still required to pay their maintenance arrears.&nbsp; It is not in lieu of, it does not take them off the hook.&nbsp; And the merit of having such orders available to the Judges is that they can impose that without affecting the defaulter's employment and, thereby, aggravating the financial situation further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the measure to declare maintenance debts before the party remarries, I agree with Mdm Ho and Ms Wong that the remarrying party should<p align=left>Column: 2090<p>also declare whether he is liable to pay maintenance, in addition to whether there are other outstanding arrears. This is actually the intent of the provision because&nbsp;the party will have to first declare if there is any maintenance order and then declare whether there is any arrears owed pursuant to those maintenance orders.&nbsp; I will also note Mdm Ho and Ms Audrey Wong's point that there must be a limited window for reporting arrears to the credit bureaus in order to prevent abuse and also to make sure that the credit reports are accurate and timely.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the provision of&nbsp;a banker's guarantee, we have gone&nbsp;through this in detail and we crafted&nbsp;the legislation in a way to make it as easy as possible for the complainant.&nbsp; Basically,&nbsp;the complainant can make a claim on the banker's guarantee without going to Court to prove that there was a default.&nbsp; And if there is any excess claim from the banker's guarantee, it will be offset against future maintenance payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Limiting the amount guaranteed to three months is a practical move as many defaulters may not have enough money on hand to guarantee the larger sums of money for maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requiring a second guarantee to kick in automatically would pose judicial issues because it may be potentially unfair to the defaulter, if there was no&nbsp;subsequent Court&nbsp;hearing to determine whether he had indeed defaulted the first time round.&nbsp; We had to arrive&nbsp;at an appropriate balance between convenience of complainant and fairness to the potential defaulter.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In pursuing stronger enforcement, we are also mindful that we must give defaulters a fair chance.&nbsp; Hence, the credit reports will be updated when they settle their arrears.&nbsp; And for defaulters who are issued with attachments of earnings&nbsp;orders, their employment should not be jeopardised.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;I am&nbsp;telling <p align=left>Column: 2091<p>employers, \"Please do not terminate someone&nbsp;simply because&nbsp;of the attachment of earnings orders against them\".&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if any individual feels unfairly dismissed&nbsp;because of this, he has recourse through the Ministry of Manpower for unfair dismissal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Court-ordered financial counselling for defaulters, as&nbsp;with Court orders in general, non-compliance to such orders is&nbsp;tantamount to contempt of Court, and it carries a potential fine or even imprisonment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Phua has also asked for the Courts to extend the hours to 9.00 pm (almost parliamentary time) [<I>laughter</I> ] in order to facilitate the access by working women.&nbsp; As things stand, first, I want to acknowledge the incredible hard work that has been committed on the part of the Courts to already make significant changes to streamline the current enforcement process by reducing the steps and allowing for filing of complaints through video-link.&nbsp;With regard to operating at night, we actually went to them with the suggestion and they informed us that&nbsp;this may not be practical.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently Night Courts but the Night Courts currently deal with essentially regulatory offences in which the offenders almost always plead guilty.&nbsp; If the offender decides not to plead guilty, &nbsp;his case will subsequently be heard in the day Court.&nbsp; Such maintenance hearings, which often entail respondents' and claimant presentations, may be lengthy and there may be insufficient time for such proceedings to be conducted expeditiously at night.&nbsp; So, the Court preference is still for these hearings to be conducted during regular office hours.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Mdm Phua's suggestion to engage auxiliary police to execute warrants of arrests for defaulters, this may not be feasible because it would require the errant spouses to bear the costs of hiring an auxiliary police in order to arrest them.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2092<p>This will inevitably impair their ability to pay and we do not want this to result in reduced amount that is available to the ex-spouse and children.&nbsp; We will continue to study how we can make life more uncomfortable for defaulters but without impacting their ability to pay.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several Members, including Mr Hri Kumar,&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef, Mdm Ho, Ms Lee and Ms Wong have also called for the establishment of a dedicated agency on maintenance and&nbsp;they use the analogy of the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents.&nbsp; But let me reiterate why we are not prepared to do this yet.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the family should be the first line of support for individuals, and only when that fails,&nbsp;does legislation provide for the appropriate sanctions as decided by the Courts based on the relative merits of each case.&nbsp; Our preferred approach is to strengthen the existing legal framework and that is why we have worked on improving and streamlining the Court processes, amending the Women's Charter, so that the family members will find it&nbsp;easier to hold each other accountable.&nbsp; I would prefer to let these new measures run in first, measure their impact, before we decide on the next step.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also worthwhile pointing out that even the Tribunal for Maintenance of Parents does not enforce maintenance orders.&nbsp; It may decide on maintenance orders but it does not enforce maintenance orders.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tribunal and Commissioner's office provides legal avenues and a process for a parent to obtain a Maintenance Order.&nbsp;&nbsp;But thereafter, that Maintenance Order, if it is not complied with, is enforced through the Family Courts, the same Family Court using the same procedures and same sanctions that are available under the Women's Charter.&nbsp; So let us try to work this system first.&nbsp; We have made some<p align=left>Column: 2093<p>significant improvements.&nbsp; Let us&nbsp;measure its impact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, there were calls, not only within this House but outside this House, for greater parity in the treatment between men and women, in particular in&nbsp;two areas, &nbsp;access to children for men and whether we should change the \"Women's Charter\" into&nbsp;the \"Family Charter\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first agree totally with Mr Seah Kian Peng that men should be given reasonable access to their children by their ex-wives.&nbsp; Ex-wives should not use access to children as a bargaining chip for the collection of maintenance.&nbsp; We should all, as adults, recognise that children have a right to both parents and will almost always benefit from access to both parents.&nbsp; And no matter how ugly the dispute between the adults is, we should not make our children hostage or bargaining chips.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would, however, also go on to add that breaches in access orders are also punishable as contempt of Court, which can also lead to a fine or imprisonment.&nbsp; So just as expect the men to pay for the maintenance arrears, women should also comply fully with the access orders issued by the Court.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were also calls in the name of&nbsp;gender equality&nbsp;for men to be able to claim maintenance from women.&nbsp; Let me put it&nbsp;to you this way: 14 years ago, the Select Committee said we&nbsp;were not ready yet.&nbsp; I am afraid at this point in time, the answer is still we are not ready yet.&nbsp; I hope it will not take another 14 years but I am sure every time we review the Women's Charter, this question will arise.&nbsp; Let me tell you why I think we are not ready yet.&nbsp; In terms of the labour force participation rate and incomes, today, there is still a gap.&nbsp; The labour force participation rate&nbsp;for women is 55%, as <p align=left>Column: 2094<p>compared to 75% for men.&nbsp; I do not have the figures for income offhand but you all know there is a gap.&nbsp; Secondly, all of us who do the Meet-the-People Sessions will notice an asymmetry.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is women and their children, almost exclusively, who come to us for help because of problems&nbsp;of post-divorce or the&nbsp;failure to pay maintenance.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The brutal truth is, even today, although we have made much progress, women and children still need protection.&nbsp;We also have to ask ourselves whether, as a society,&nbsp;we have&nbsp;reached a point where the majority of us are willing to say that a woman has the responsibility to support a man, even after a divorce. I think an increasing number of people have come down to that view.&nbsp; I am not sure outside this House that the majority of people has come down to this view.&nbsp; So, my sense is, we will hold the current position, flag this&nbsp;as an issue for constant review and certainly the next time round,&nbsp;hopefully as we make further progress, we can get to that point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, this is also not the time to rename&nbsp;the \"Women's Charter\"&nbsp;as&nbsp;the \"Family Charter\" because it does not have the exclusive monopoly on family law. An example of&nbsp; another law is the Maintenance of Parents Act, which is also related to family but, clearly, it stands alone.&nbsp;If and when we get to the point&nbsp;where we propose a Family&nbsp;Charter, I think the&nbsp;Ministry will&nbsp;have to amalgamate&nbsp;all these disparate pieces of law in order to do that. I do not think we are ready to do that,&nbsp;and I do not want to rush into it but I think the roadmap for the future is clear.&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, let me end by saying that the many views expressed both within and outside this House show that&nbsp;as Singaporeans, we still attach great importance to the institution of marriage, to dealing with the tragedy of divorce and to mitigating the impact&nbsp;on the children. These issues are not things which can&nbsp;be easily&nbsp;resolved, and certainly&nbsp;not simply <p align=left>Column: 2095<p>by passing laws. There is a need to balance many interests&nbsp;&ndash; the rights and the protection of the ex-husband, the ex-wives,&nbsp;the children; the rights of individuals and their decisions on marriage and divorce&nbsp;versus making sure that&nbsp;the State's intervention&nbsp;is appropriate but not excessive,&nbsp;and there is a need to get a balance between efficiency in implementation&nbsp;of Court orders and with rules of natural justice. &nbsp; I will conclude by saying that this piece of legislation, 50 years old,&nbsp;groundbreaking, continues to evolve.&nbsp; I think we have made important steps now but this is not the end of it, and there will be changes in the future.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:EXEMPTED BUSINESS--><p align=left>Column: 2095<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:EXEMPTED BUSINESS:::2095--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>EXEMPTED BUSINESS<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Motion--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Motion)<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the proceedings on the business set down on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 2.&nbsp;&ndash; [Mr Mah Bow Tan].</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t<!--SECTION_NAME:BILLS--><p align=left>Column: 2095<p>      \t\t\t\t\t<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>WOMEN'S CHARTER (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debate resumed.</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether the current Family Court Judges have any access to the children before the divorce proceedings.

This Act was last revised in 2001 and a decade later, we are revising it again.&nbsp; I would like to touch on the key proposals that this Bill seeks to put in place.</p><p></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide greater clarity, we have articulated the guiding principles; these are actually principles which have been in place, but not enshrined in legislation over the past 60 years. The Bill includes two guiding principles. First, that the parents of the child or young person have the primary responsibility for the care and welfare of the child or young person, and should discharge their responsibilities to promote the welfare of the child or young person. This statement reflects our belief that the family is the key institution for nurturing our young. The Government can encourage and support families in their discharge of their familial responsibilities, but the Government&nbsp;cannot be a substitute for the family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second principle states that in the administration and application of the Act, the welfare and best interest of the child or young person shall be the first and paramount consideration.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><I>Licensing of children and young persons homes<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 25 of the Bill refers to the licensing of Children and Young Persons <p align=left>Column: 2098<p>Homes. Historically, these Homes have been operated by voluntary welfare organisations. Some of them have very long histories of compassionate service dating back to the early 1900s. Over the years, the Homes have evolved from providing basic shelter and attending to the needs of the children, to the point where now they are&nbsp;providing care and rehabilitation to children, helping children to reintegrate with their families&nbsp;and promoting educational opportunities so that these children can fulfil their full potential. &nbsp;Currently, we have 19 such Homes with about 900 residents.&nbsp;&nbsp; MCYS runs two Juvenile Homes with about 300 residents. My Ministry has worked very closely with the Homes over many decades, journeying with them through the changing trends in child protection and youth rehabilitation work, and ensuring that we continue to meet the needs of the residents and their families.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the licensing of Children and Young Persons Homes is an important step and a key milestone in the development of the residential care sector.&nbsp; It signals our commitment to enhancing the welfare, protection and care for our children in residential care and formalises the standards of care that we expect the Homes to provide. The Bill proposes powers for MCYS officers to inspect the Homes and to issue licences to operators who have met the licensing requirements. These requirements would include the adequacy of the physical premises of the Home,&nbsp;the quality of personnel and processes to ensure that appropriate care and supervision is available at all times to the residents. New Homes will also need to comply with the licensing requirements before they can begin operations. The Act will provide avenues for operators to take remedial actions when requirements have not been met and for appeals on decisions made with regard to the issuing and revocation of licences.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2099<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The licensing scheme will also extend protections to children with special needs in three other Homes for the Disabled currently that take in such children.<br><I>&nbsp;</I></p><p><I>Review Board<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be a Review Board to review all cases of children in residential care. This is in keeping with international practice and we want to have a system which will ensure that there is early planning for each child&rsquo;s welfare and it provides for a multi-disciplinary platform for workers from the Homes and other professionals to work towards a care plan for the child that will best meet his or her specific needs. A Review Board comprising individuals with relevant expertise will be established to review all children residing in all licensed Homes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><I>Early intervention with children and families<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill also seeks to enhance early intervention for children and families that require assistance in providing for their safety and well-being. Let me touch on this point of voluntary care arrangements.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Voluntary care agreements<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Bill introduces a new provision on voluntary care agreements which provides for care agreements promoting the welfare of the child to be made by the parents or guardians of the child. Child protection work has often been associated with Court orders and removing the child from his or her home. But I want to stress that this, in fact, should be a last resort. There is much more that can be done to enable or empower a family to take better care of the children and to&nbsp;nurture their children before the situation spirals out of control. Too often, serious cases of child abuse occur when there is no early detection or failure of early intervention for families who are struggling to cope with raising their children.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 2100<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The voluntary care agreements represent an attempt to formalise and encapsulate the joint efforts of both the parents on one hand and the child protection officers on the other hand to work together to collaborate on a voluntary basis to ensure the safety and well-being of the child.&nbsp; Currently, child protection officers work with families on care plans for the child, and such care plans will address issues such as the child&rsquo;s educational needs, supervision of the child, support and assistance that may be rendered from community agencies, etc. Having such explicit plans or agreements&nbsp;&ndash; drawn up and agreed&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;help the parents to better understand and to better implement the steps that are needed in order to address the needs of their child.&nbsp; My Ministry will also issue regulations as to how these voluntary care agreements can&nbsp;be made, how they will be reviewed and how they will be adjusted according to the needs of the child and family, and in particular, to safeguard the rights and interests of the child and the parents.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This provision does not compel the parents to enter into a care agreement involuntarily. I want to emphasise that such agreements must be voluntarily entered into. There may be situations where parents may decline to comply with the advice of the Child Protection Service at an early stage. In such cases, the Child Protection Service will have to simply be extra watchful. And if the situation worsens to the point where the child is in danger or is clearly in need of extra care or&nbsp;protection as defined in section 4 of the Act, only then will&nbsp;an application to the Court for a formal care and protection order under section 49&nbsp;be made. So, we need to achieve the right balance.<br></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Obtaining information to establish if child/young person is in need of care and protection</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with the objective of early intervention, the Bill also proposes <p align=left>Column: 2101<p> clarification to section 8 to enable a Protector to make inquires where he has reasonable grounds to believe that a relevant offence has been, is being or will be committed against any child or young person or if&nbsp;any child or young person is in need of care or protection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the CYPA provides that the Protector may obtain information only when an offence is believed to have been committed in respect of a child or young person.&nbsp; However, there may be situations where a child is in need of care and protection, before an offence has actually been committed.&nbsp; Consequently, this amendment will enable a Protector to make inquiries at an early stage, so long as he has reasonable grounds to believe that&nbsp;such a&nbsp;child or young person is in need of care or protection.&nbsp; The objective in both these provisions is early detection and early intervention and, hopefully, without having&nbsp;to drag the case and the parents&nbsp;into&nbsp;Court and be subjected to the full litany of legal processes and procedures, whilst&nbsp;we still keep that power in reserve.</p><p><br><I>Enhancing the management of child protection cases</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a child is established to be in need of care and protection, it is important that we make sure that each&nbsp;case is managed in the best interest of the child. And this Bill, therefore, seeks to enhance the management of child protection cases, in the following areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> First, protecting children or young persons who have been removed.&nbsp; Clause 10 of the Bill includes a proposed amendment that will allow the Protector to restrict access or require supervised access to a child or young person that has been removed under the CYPA.&nbsp; Such children usually require medical attention or temporary care while arrangements are<p align=left>Column: 2102<p>being made to bring the case to Court within three days of the removal, for child protection proceedings.&nbsp; For example, there have been cases where the alleged perpetrator or the family members appear at the hospital to threaten&nbsp;and intimidate the child into retracting his or her statement.&nbsp; The priority during this period is to ensure, first,&nbsp;that the child is safe.&nbsp; Secondly, &nbsp;that the child receives medical and other emotional treatment and, furthermore, that we do not allow the child to be further&nbsp;re-victimised or harassed by the alleged perpetrators or&nbsp;perpetrator while the investigation is underway.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other area which we are working on is on exempting children and young children from Court appearances.&nbsp; Court proceedings are&nbsp;often very intimidating for children, especially when proceedings take place over several sessions, or if the perpetrator is&nbsp;in Court in person.&nbsp; Clause 23 of the Bill proposes that the Court be given discretion to exempt a child or young person from having to attend Court proceedings, in cases where it is assessed that Court attendance may adversely affect the child.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area&nbsp;is in protecting&nbsp;the identity and privacy of the child&nbsp;or young person.&nbsp; In 2001, section 35 was introduced in the CYPA which prohibits the publication&nbsp;and broadcast of information that would identify a child or young person involved in Court proceedings.&nbsp; However, the child&rsquo;s privacy may also be compromised during the investigation period leading up to Court proceedings, for example&nbsp;&ndash; and this is in real life&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;sometimes you get&nbsp;news reports or&nbsp;a photograph of the child or identifying details of the child and sometimes even the address is available either in the mass media or on the Internet.&nbsp; Such exposure and infringement of privacy&nbsp;would negatively affect the recovery process for the child or young person.&nbsp; Clause 15, therefore, introduces  <p align=left>Column: 2103<p> a new provision that will extend current protections such that the identity of&nbsp;the child or young person who is or has been subject to an investigation under the CYPA to such protection.&nbsp; In particular, this provision is meant to address the publication of information in the mass media or other broadcast or online platforms but it does not prevent the sharing of information among the appropriate, relevant professionals who are providing&nbsp;help to these specific children&nbsp;or young persons.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further safeguard the child or young person&rsquo;s privacy, another provision will be introduced to prevent breaches of confidentiality by persons who may be in receipt of information on the child that was shared with them in the process of exercising any powers or duties under the Act.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is vital that the systems and processes put in place to protect children do not end up, inadvertently, further traumatising the child or young person.&nbsp; The amendments I have just elaborated on are key to ensuring that Singapore&rsquo;s child protection system continues to be child-centric whilst efficient, expedient and safe.</p><p><br><I>Penalties for sexual exploitation</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to mention the penalties for sexual exploitation of children and young persons in the Act. The Bill proposes for the penalty for sexual exploitation of children and young persons under section 7 to be raised from&nbsp;a minimum two years' imprisonment and a maximum of four years, to a minimum of five years and a maximum of seven years. Penalties for sexual exploitation of a child or&nbsp;unlawful transfer of possession of a child and importation of a child under false pretences have been adjusted to align with penalties against similar offences in the Women&rsquo;s Charter to  <p align=left>Column: 2104<p> ensure that equal protection is accorded to both boys and girls.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serious child sexual abuse cases may also be prosecuted under the Penal Code which carries even higher penalties.&nbsp; The Penal Code had also been reviewed and amended in 2007.&nbsp; Under section 376A, the penalty for sexual penetration of minor below the age of 16 years is 10 to 20 years of imprisonment.&nbsp; For less serious sexual offences, sections 354 and 354A provide for imprisonment terms of&nbsp;five or 10 years where the victim is a minor below the age of 14 years.&nbsp; Together, the penalties within the CYPA and the Penal Code should provide for adequate deterrence against sexual exploitation of children and young persons.</p><p><br><I>Age definitions of the child</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this juncture, I would also like to address recent comments and discussions concerning age definitions of the child and young person.&nbsp; In our law, currently, we define a child&nbsp;as a person below the age of 14 years.&nbsp; A young person is defined as a person 14 years or above and below the age of 16 years.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the public consultation of the Bill, we received sometimes contradictory suggestions on these&nbsp;definitions.&nbsp; Some suggested increasing the threshold to 18 years, meaning more people would be defined as children and young persons whilst others suggested decreasing the threshold to 15 years.&nbsp; This was especially in response to some more violent episodes involving young people in recent times.&nbsp; We decided not to make any changes to our long-standing position.&nbsp; I would like to assure Members that there are currently adequate safeguards and mechanisms to protect and rehabilitate both young as well as older youth offenders who are&nbsp;more than 16 years old.&nbsp; The Guidance Programme, which is&nbsp;a  <p align=left>Column: 2105<p> Court diversionary programme for first time offenders, will be further extended to accommodate youths up to the age of 21 years of age.&nbsp; New community based sentencing options, such as the Community Service Orders, Day Reporting Orders, Mandatory Treatment Orders, Short Detention Orders and Community Work Orders have also been provided for through the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code which came into effect on 2nd January.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upshot of all this is that we have more rehabilitation options for the Community Court to use in dealing with offenders between the age of 16&nbsp;and 21 years of age, and for the continued approach of deterrence, restorative justice and rehabilitation of young offenders. Where young offenders are assessed not to be suitable for community-based rehabilitation, reformative training is another option in lieu of imprisonment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our justice system, and I have taken some lengths to emphasise this point, is both based on restorative and rehabilitative and deterrence.&nbsp; All these elements are available and operate in conjunction to deal with this problem of young people who may be at risk.&nbsp; The approach has worked well so far and we have in Singapore&nbsp;a robust rehabilitation and protection system for young people, and I believe we should continue in this direction.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, I know that&nbsp;there had been calls for us to adjust the definition of&nbsp;children and young persons down to below the age of 15, thereby making those who are 15 and above liable to be dealt with outside of the juvenile justice system. The argument behind this call is that youths appear to mature at an earlier age nowadays compared to a generation ago. &nbsp; I believe that while providing deterrence is one of the <p align=left>Column: 2106<p>considerations for the juvenile justice system, I would like to emphasise that our objective of the CYPA and our juvenile justice system is not only to&nbsp;punish but also to rehabilitate.&nbsp; I hope Members of this House will agree that we have the right balance at this point in time.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Sir, I would like to conclude with a note of caution.&nbsp; This Bill updates and improves our child protection framework.&nbsp; But we must bear in mind that despite all our best efforts, there will, inevitably, from time to time be some tragic cases. There will&nbsp;also be occasions when we may be over zealous in our efforts to protect children and young persons, and we have to get the balance right both in legislation as well as operationally on the ground.&nbsp; It is not an easy matter but it is an important matter, and I would also add that the State cannot unilaterally protect all children and young persons.&nbsp; This is a sacred duty that all of us as parents, family members, members of the community, professionals, officials and law makers will have to perform this duty collectively.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Issues like young marriages and multiple re-marriages, dysfunctional families, single mothers and other socio-economic problems will surface from time to time. The lack of social morals and ethics will become more pronounced among those affected. The widening generation gap among some families must also be given attention to.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a society and nation, we must lead the effort to help these families start their lives anew, and reshape their minds and lives.

The Children and Young Persons (Amendment) Bill has introduced significant changes and additions to the way we deal with child protection issues.&nbsp; Whilst many of the amendments have been pro-active and show tenacity in confronting many prevailing problems, there are several areas which I hope the Minister can take cognisance of.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed section 9 is worrying.&nbsp; As the Minister himself has just explained, the power to remove children should only be exercised when there is a real fear of imminent physical or psychological danger.&nbsp; The suggested provision may well be too drastic as the law does not prescribe or give specific guidance or even boundaries as to when this power is to be properly exercised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In most cases and contrary to common public perception, the neglect and abuse of children are hardly intentional.&nbsp; Parents do treasure their offsprings.&nbsp; Unfortunately, if the adults in the families are unemployed, in ill health or are over-stressed and under-supported in other aspects, then it is quite common for them not to have any inclination or time to be fussing over their children.&nbsp; The forcible separation of children from these families prevents the guardians or parents from fulfilling their role in society meaningfully.&nbsp; The stigma unwittingly created by the authorities will only marginalise them further.&nbsp; Rather than treat parents as risks to their own children, how can we as a society come together to assist these families to raise their children?&nbsp; I feel that it will be a great societal boon if legislation, Government agencies, civil society and the community work hand in hand to tackle these difficult issues collaboratively and with understanding.&nbsp; The Ministry's \"many helping hands\" approach should be applied in this situation as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2111<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a similar vein, the proposed section 27A restricts the publication of information leading to the identification of a child or young person who is the subject of any investigation, or has been taken into care or custody, or is the subject of any order under the Act.&nbsp; While it is imperative to keep their identities confidential to prevent stigmatisation, such measures should not be an impediment to professionals and others offering help and assistance to these children, young persons and their families.&nbsp; The Director who grants approval to reveal any information should do it with clarity and reasonableness so as not to stumble the helping partners rendering assistance in the best interests of the child or young person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the provision of Voluntary Care Arrangements, the new section 48A which specifies when this power can be exercised gives the impression that the Director may enter into such agreements merely to promote the welfare of a child or young person without declaring him or her in need of care or protection.&nbsp; There is therefore a need to clarify what \"welfare\" means, who the law pertains to and how the State should respond to it.&nbsp; A real danger is that middle-class culture, standards and values be imposed on a range of families with multiple challenges, including poverty, chronic illness, mental health concerns and physical and intellectual disability.&nbsp; As such, decisions should not merely be in the sole purview of the Director.&nbsp; There should be appropriate safeguards so that the good intention upon which this power is given can be materialised.&nbsp; Without clear and objective standards of welfare, this might give rise to unhealthy or unnecessary competition between parents, foster families and institutions over who can better provide for or take care of the children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In situations where the child is clearly not in need of protection and is not being<p align=left>Column: 2112<p>ill-treated, struggling parents can easily be persuaded of the benefits of alternative care for their children, simply because they love their children and want what is best for them.&nbsp; The State should perhaps act in line with first principles and only assume responsibility for children who are clearly in need of care and protection.&nbsp; As such, informally or formally made care agreements or arrangements should empower the families, with appropriate support, instead of further marginalising them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.37 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is an important Bill as it aims to provide better protection and care of children and young persons against violence, abuse and neglect.&nbsp; In particular, the new licensing provisions will ensure highest standards of professionalism, better quality in the care and protection of children and young persons.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Sir, I have mixed feelings over some of the provisions of this Bill.&nbsp; On the one hand, I recognise the need to enhance the powers of the State so that we can better protect innocent, defenceless children from neglect and abuse. Even as we are sitting here debating this Bill, we are reminded so painfully of the recent death of a young, innocent child, the victim of horrible abuse and neglect that forever robbed him of the chance to grow into adulthood and fulfil his own dreams and hopes. We shudder to think of how many more such cases could possibly exist, and we want to do everything possible to prevent such a tragedy from recurring.&nbsp; But even as we wrestle with these emotions, we also recognise that family relationships are so complex and that families today are under tremendous stress and need all the help<p align=left>Column: 2113<p>that they can get so that they can provide children with the kind of warmth, support and care that only families can truly provide.&nbsp; The ideal place for children must be in the bosom of their families and not anywhere else. Children should be removed from their parents only in the most severe situations where there is real or imminent danger to them or where there is real neglect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, I read with some trepidation the new paragraph 4(c) which describes one of the situations in which a child or young person is in need of care and protection as when, and I quote,&nbsp;\"a parent or guardian of the child or young person is unable or has neglected to provide adequate food, clothing, medical aid, lodging, care or other necessities of life for the child or young person\".&nbsp; I wonder whether MCYS may be over-reaching itself and this provision is too expansive.&nbsp; The key word here is \"adequate\" but standards of adequacy would obviously differ from family to family depending on their financial situation.&nbsp; Poor, needy families surviving on the barest minimum may consider what they are providing to their children adequate but it may not be adequate in the eyes of someone used to a higher standard of living.&nbsp; Also, there are families because of various reasons such as illness, disability or loss of employment who may find it difficult to provide for their children not because they do not&nbsp;want to but because they cannot.&nbsp; In such situations, they need help and a declaration that they could no longer provide care and protection to their children will not be helpful.&nbsp; So, I seek some clarity on this clause and how it would be interpreted and implemented in practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;this clarity is also important as it has a bearing on the other clauses of the Act which empowers the Juvenile Court to remove a child from his family or&nbsp;to <p align=left>Column: 2114</p>order his parents to enter into a bond to exercise proper care and guardianship.&nbsp; On the latter point, I am also concerned whether the Bill is overly punitive by criminalising parents who breached a Court-ordered bond to exercise proper care and guardianship.&nbsp; Could this lead to a situation where overworked social workers frustrated with parents' failure to execute the bond, then decide to refer the&nbsp; parents for prosecution instead of taking the longer and more arduous route of convincing and persuading them and helping them to overcome the difficulties that they are facing in providing for their children?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should be very careful before criminalising any situation which involves family relationships as such actions could even be counter-productive to the welfare of the child.&nbsp; I note that we had lengthy discussions when we were part of the review on the Parents' Maintenance Bill and the same issue of whether we should make it a lot&nbsp;more punitive for people who do not support their parents cropped up but we felt that we should not do so because of the complexity of family relationships and we do not want to criminalise a parental act of neglect which is considered as neglect by the authorities or some other agencies.&nbsp; So, we need to have a balance.&nbsp; I understand the need to protect the child but, at the same time, I also understand that we need to ensure that parents are not deprived with the ability to take care of the welfare of their children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I am reminded of two cases that I had dealt with which show how diverse and complex family situations are and no two situations are the same.&nbsp; One family which I had helped had&nbsp;nine children and, of course, they were&nbsp;very tight financially but the children were all well taken care of, well brought up, disciplined and they were all in school.&nbsp; But the situation of another family with seven children was not so good.&nbsp; I had to assist in the <p align=left>Column: 2115<p>placement of two of the children in a home because of the mother's fear of physical abuse by the father, and the MCYS had to take over the care of the infant child because of the parents' neglect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I hope, Sir,&nbsp;that even as we strengthen the regulatory framework, we would also continue to provide enough resources and support to families in need of help so that they can take care of their children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my final point is that the success and effectiveness of the Child Protection Service (CPS) depend not only on tighter legislation, but also on adequate staff and resources as one observation is that this service is understaffed whereas the cases that they have to deal with are complex and need intensive follow-up actions.&nbsp; As the Bill now gives greater powers to MCYS to ensure early detection and intervention, there is clearly a need to review the staffing requirements and resources needed to ensure that the Bill meets its objectives.&nbsp; The other equally important point is the need for effective and strong coordination among the agencies dealing with violence against children as there is currently no automatic referrals of all criminal cases involving children.&nbsp; The referral agencies involved are usually the Police, health authorities such as hospitals and schools.&nbsp; In the most recent case that fell through the cracks, a father was jailed for four years for molesting his daughter but after his release, he returned home and re-victimised his daughter by further abusing her for four years until his conviction for rape last year, by which time the girl was already&nbsp;above 16.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have already raised this issue in November, but I think it is really an important point and since we are debating this Bill, it is important in my view that this point is reiterated.&nbsp; In both cases of abuse, the Police had not referred the<p align=left>Column: 2116<p>case to MCYS for case management.&nbsp; So, the question to ask, in addition to adequate staffing and resources as well as good coordination among the agencies, is&nbsp;how to put in place an early warning system so that before a perpetrator is released, the family is adequately prepared and there are follow-ups by the&nbsp;Child Protection Service&nbsp;to ensure that the child is safe and protected.&nbsp; For example, I hear of cases where perpetrators go back to the home, but in the home the victim does not even have a room to herself so that at night, for instance, she can lock the door and protect herself from any potential abuse by the perpetrators upon returning home.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, when a victim was abused before she was 16, follow-ups should cover her case until she is at least 18 years old.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

But if the case is already on the radar screen and with the MCYS before the person reaches the age of 16, then follow-ups should be even after the person is 16, at least until the victim is 18 years old.&nbsp; There should also be effective counselling of the victim and her mother to ensure that they are properly rehabilitated and can continue with their lives despite the violence and the abuse perpetuated against the victim.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, Sir, what we need are clear guidelines and protocols to deal with children who are victims of abuse so that there is consistency, continuity and no one falls through the crack.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In November last year, Sir, I had raised these issues and the Minister had said that the Ministry is doing a review of the Child Protection Service&nbsp;and how it investigates, intervenes and resolves cases of violence against children.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister for an update of this review and whether the Bill also addresses some of these points?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2117<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I support this Bill.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.47 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rise in support of the Bill, especially I record my full support for the raising of the penalties under section 7 of the Bill as it shows the Government's strong resolve to protect our children from sexual abuse and it also sends a strong signal that this House will not tolerate any form of sexual abuse of our children including child pornography.&nbsp; Anyone caught for sexually abusing children under section 7 should be given nothing less than a deterrent sentence.&nbsp; We must protect our children simply because of their defenselessness and innocence.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other important change in the Act, Sir, is introduced through clause 25.&nbsp; It inserts a new Part 3A introducing a licensing framework to ensure the welfare and safety of children and young people in residential care.&nbsp; Families form the basic blocks of our society and strong families make for a cohesive nation.&nbsp; Our family members especially our vulnerable children should be provided with the necessary assistance and protection for their well being and growth.&nbsp; The licensing framework will spell clearly the requirements for homes and the standard of care in homes.&nbsp; A board will be appointed to review all the cases of children and young people residing in licensed homes and visit the homes to ensure a safe environment.&nbsp; I support this amendment as it will go a long way to raising the standard of care for the young residents.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 2118<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 5 amends section 4(c) to clarify that the child or young person may be considered to be in need of care and protection where his parent or guardian is unable or has neglected to provide adequate necessities even though the neglect was not deliberate. &nbsp;The debate has thrown up the fact that section 4(c) may be worded too widely, but I take a different view, Sir, because I think it is important to give MCYS and the officers as much room and discretion as possible, and provided of course that discretion is exercised accurately and, if that discretion is exercised accurately, then the children's best interest will be met.&nbsp; So I do support the width of section 4(c) as it is now in the Bill.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we all agree that parents, guardians and immediate family members are primarily responsible for their children.&nbsp; Hence, as our system strives to provide protection for our children,&nbsp;we want to do this within the family environment as far as possible.&nbsp; We would ideally want to avoid separating children from their families unless there is physical or psychological danger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where children are neglected or abused, then as part of our \"Many Helping Hands\" approach, the Government and the community must come together to assist such families to correct their ways and then attempt to raise their children.&nbsp; This approach is much preferable to removing the children from their families and transferring them to an institution of foster home.&nbsp; However, as I said earlier, removal in instances where there is abuse or neglect is the sad but better choice for the children.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I strongly urge the Ministry to consider providing more resources and infrastructural support to such distressed families to enable them to raise their children in a reasonable home environment focusing on the child's health and education.&nbsp; In addition to financial and <p align=left>Column: 2119<p> other resources support, counselling and courses on how to manage their families and children should be given on a regular, sustained basis.&nbsp; Follow-up visits by welfare officers are also necessary.&nbsp; Also, the officers in question should not hesitate to notify the Police if there are signs of abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I agree with Mdm Halimah Yacob that there should be interfacing between MCYS, Police and cross-referencing between the two.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new section 9A empowers psychologists or approved welfare officers, in addition to registered medical practitioners, if they find evidence of abuse or neglect to commit a child or young person to a place of temporary care.&nbsp; I would like to know if the Ministry will provide the appropriate training to the concerned personnel to ensure that they are qualified to make such judgement calls to ensure all steps are taken in the best interest of the child.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan:</B> Sir, I have three short queries for the Minister relating to this Amendment Bill.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the amendment to section 8 facilitates early intervention in cases of suspect abuse.&nbsp; While I appreciate the importance of early intervention, I am also mindful that an over-reactive system may result in more \"false positives\" which will result in traumatising the families involved.&nbsp; Sir, may I ask the Minister to comment on the safeguards that are in place to ensure that a balanced approach is taken for child protection?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, while I agree with the expanded scope of well-being covered by this Amendment Bill, I am also mindful that notions of emotional and psychological abuse are hard to establish.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 2120</p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What constitutes emotional abuse?&nbsp; Or psychological abuse?&nbsp; If a parent overindulges her child &ndash; does that constitute abuse?&nbsp; Some might argue that it does&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that&nbsp;it is a case of I quote, section 4(c),&nbsp;part (ii),&nbsp;\"neglected to exercise proper supervision and control&rdquo;.&nbsp; Unlike the hon. Member, Mr Christopher de Souza, who is my MP, I am not as comfortable with section 4(c) compared to his comments on it.&nbsp; I am not comfortable because I do not agree with the expanse that it is important for MCYS officers to work because it covers many dimensions of well-being but my discomfort with section 4(c), both parts&nbsp;(i) and (ii), is in notions of adequacy because I think that is hard to establish.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving along, I think that when it comes to a debate on the well-being of children, it is necessarily a difficult one because parenthood in itself is a learned process.&nbsp; As meanings of childhood and responsibilities of parenthood evolve, as our society matures, we must have in place consistent messages and processes to aid parents and empower them to be effective guardians.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My final concern relates to the punitive tone of this Amendment Bill.&nbsp; While there are cases where parents and guardians inflict pain and suffering on their young charges deliberately and with intent, I believe that, in many instances, neglect and abuse are unintended outcomes due to constraints in circumstances.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a family sociologist, I believe that in most situations, the family is the best place to raise a child.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments in this Bill are focused primarily on measures in place to remove the child from dysfunctional families.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is very little mention on how interventions can be<p align=left>Column: 2121</p>invoked to alleviate the disadvantages faced by such families, and to equip them with the necessary skills and resources so that they are in a better position to safeguard the well-being of their young charges.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to note the inclusion of the voluntary care agreement in section 48A.&nbsp; Can the Minister comment on how the voluntary care agreement can serve to empower disadvantaged families and enable them to raise their children in a safe and conducive environment?&nbsp; For example, does invoking the voluntary care agreement include helping the parents identify the constraints faced by the family and provision of aid to the family?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to ensuring adequacy in financial resources, do we also have schemes in place that help educate and raise awareness of what good parenting entails?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, I believe that the first reaction should be to help families help themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should only remove the child from the family as a very last resort.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These concerns aside, I support this important Bill.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.55 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lily Neo:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I stand to&nbsp;support the Children and Young Persons (Amendment) Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every child is a gift&nbsp;from God and is precious.&nbsp; Every child needs all the care and love that he or she deserves.&nbsp; All children are dependable on their parents or caregivers as they are helpless and vulnerable especially when they are very young.&nbsp; I believe that all parents love their children because it is a natural human instinct.&nbsp; Thus, parents will give the best <p align=left>Column: 2122</p>care to their own children.&nbsp; It is in this context therefore that I have concerns about section 48A of this Bill legitimising \"voluntary care agreements\".&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is already provision in section 9(1)(a) of this Bill where the Director, protector or police officer may&nbsp;without the warrant and by such assistance and force as is necessary to&nbsp;remove a child or young person to a place of temporary care and protection, and so on.&nbsp; Sir, the question is whether section 48A is really necessary.&nbsp; In England, the government no longer uses a voluntary care arrangement to get a child into care.&nbsp; All such cases must go to the Court.&nbsp; They have stated in their June Act 1989 that the government will provide respite accommodation if the child has no person caring for him, is lost or abandoned or whose caregiver for whatever reasons is unable to continue caring for him, eg, the caregiver is sick, in hospital or incarcerated.&nbsp; In this sense, the \"voluntary care arrangement\" was removed by the Children Act 1989 and replaced with respite accommodation.&nbsp; The Children Act 1989 prevents voluntary care arrangements being used to remove children from their families.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while I understand that we may have the best intentions in preventing harm or possible harm to some vulnerable children, we must make sure that we are not over zealous and cause more harm&nbsp;than good by taking children away from their own parents.&nbsp; Do we have trained professionals to give each case its due diligence?&nbsp; How do we&nbsp;ensure that when the State takes over the&nbsp;management, the replacement home is indeed&nbsp;in the best interest of these children and their families?&nbsp; Is there any safeguard in place?&nbsp; Are there set criteria to ascertain that removing the child from his or her home is indeed the appropriate solution?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, may I ask the Minister if there are avenues for parents to resume care of the child when circumstances or<p align=left>Column: 2123</p>conditions change sufficiently to allow the child to return home?&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to quote the General Assembly of the United Nations:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"We are convinced that the family, as the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of&nbsp;all its members and particularly children, should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the community.\"&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many a time, contrary to common public perception, the neglect and abuse of children is hardly intentional.&nbsp; Sir, much more often, these families are over-stressed and under-supported.&nbsp; Instead of just prescribing separation of children from these families and thereby preventing them from fulfilling their role in society meaningfully and marginalising them further, can more constructive efforts to help these families raise their children be put in place?&nbsp; Strategies like assisting them in removing any aggravating factors and those that help them maintain the child in his or her home have to be fully explored.&nbsp; It will be much better if we can identify such families early, assist them early and show them preventive measures in parenthood failure.&nbsp; May I request MCYS to allocate resources and implement measures for this?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am suggesting that disadvantaged children be given better attention and assistance by our Government.&nbsp; They need a holistic approach in assistance for their well-being, education and upbringing.</p><p></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Such adults need a hands-on approach in parenting skills, in job opportunity or job upgrading. It will be good if vulnerable families are identified and assigned social workers, in order to identify their needs and follow them through individually. What we need now is to have&nbsp;more permanent<p align=left>Column: 2124</p>constructive programmes and resources, and also the right policies implementing assistance to them. It may be necessary to help the parents provide better and more conducive environments to bring up their children.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dysfunctional families may need help in many areas to ensure stable homes. Some parents of these families may even need medical care or psychiatric/psychological help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another, and perhaps the best, approach is aiming at preventing dysfunctional homes or potential dysfunctional homes from getting worse. It will be good, while improving their well-being, to help the children get social-levelling opportunities through education. It will also be good for their parents to get out of their poverty traps and not end up as failures,&nbsp;future dysfunctional families. Therefore, through a&nbsp;hands-on guidance by designated social workers tailoring to each family's needs, taking better advantage of available schemes suitable for improving their family status is then possible.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>7.02 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Sir, while I note and support the Government's intention to protect the safety and well-being of children and young persons, I have several concerns about the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the first concern is whether, under this Bill, poor families are at greater risk of being broken up. Clause 5 amends section 4, regarding situations where the child is considered in need of care and protection. The amendment was introduced into section 4(c), a new category of families, where the authorities may consider removing the child from his parents. This scenario is where the parent is unable to provide the child with adequate food, clothing, medical aid, lodging, care or other necessities of life, even though the parent's failure has not been wilful or<p align=left>Column: 2125</p>unreasonable. So this new scenario is quite different from the existing scenario of children being taken into care, where the parent&nbsp;is usually blameworthy in some way.&nbsp; An inability to provide one's family with adequate food or lodging could result simply from reasons like poverty or lack of employment prospects.&nbsp;In this respect, I share the concerns of Mdm Halimah Yacob and Assoc. Prof. Paulin&nbsp;Tay Straughan. This amendment potentially puts poor families at risk of being broken up and their children fostered out or institutionalised, simply because they are poor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To take a child out of his own family to grow up, raised by strangers or institutions is a drastic step which would change lives forever. If the parents are found to have a good relationship with the child, should the Government not instead support the family while keeping them intact? If the parents cannot provide adequately due to poor resources, is it not the Government's duty to provide or mobilise resources to assist the family in food, medical aid and lodging?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, my concern is about voluntary care arrangements. Clause 22 introduces a new section 48A about voluntary care arrangements. Such arrangements enable the Director of Social Welfare to have a child placed in a care arrangement so long as the parents consent. There would be no need to seek the approval of the Juvenile Court in such voluntary cases. I note that there is some concern among welfare workers about the lack of court oversight in voluntary arrangements. It was pointed out, during the public consultation of the Bill, that even when people act in good faith, there is a danger of over-reaction, resulting in false positives, ie, children assessed to be in need of care and protection when they were not. It was recommended that Court oversight should be an integral part of all <p align=left>Column: 2126</p>such care and protection arrangements, including voluntary arrangements, to give further assurance that the child's welfare has been thoroughly considered. This appears to be a sound recommendation but it is not in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is likely that the sort of parents who would be asked to agree to voluntary care arrangements would be facing other struggles in life and may not have the luxury of legal advice. We should, therefore, be more vigilant to guard against the situation when parents perceive that they have no choice but to agree to care arrangements suggested by the Director. Why not provide for Court oversight, even for voluntary arrangements, to make the process more rigorous?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my next concern is about how much due process there is for parents at the Juvenile Court.&nbsp;Clause 23 amends section 49 on the Juvenile Court's powers in care and protection. The Court's powers include power to order that the child be removed from the&nbsp;parents' care and placed in a foster home or an institution. Sir, while we are concerned to protect children, the process should also be a fair one. Although the parents have a right to attend the hearing and to be heard under section 49(3), it is not spelt out that they are entitled to see and challenge the report put up by MCYS to the Court.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a recent case of <I>ABV and Another v Child Protector</I>, mentioned by Assoc.&nbsp;Prof. Fatimah Lateef earlier, the parents' appeal to the High Court from a Juvenile Court order, placing their child into care. The High Court disapproved of the then practice of not providing the parents with the case information given to the court. In answer to my parliamentary question subsequently, the Minister indicated that MCYS will henceforth provide information or leave it to the Court to direct them. While I note that the Ministry has heeded the Court's opinion, why is there no<p align=left>Column: 2127</p>provision in this Bill to ensure that the parents are duly informed of their case which MCYS is presenting against them?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a related point under section 49, the Court can order a child or young person or his parent or guardian to undergo medical and psychological assessments which outcome must be reported to the court. Section 49(7) is being amended to say that a copy of this assessment must now be given to the protector as well. But there is no mention of a copy of the assessment being given to the parent or guardian. I would like the Minister to clarify what the practice is and if a copy is not given to the parent, this seems rather high-handed, especially since under that section, the parent is supposed to pay for the assessment to be done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, also under the&nbsp;current section 49, one of the options that the Court has, in care and protection cases, is to require the parents to enter into a bond to exercise proper care and guardianship over the child. This Bill introduces a new subsection 11, where&nbsp;the parents fail to enter the bond in time, they will be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of up to $2,000. Sir, as mentioned by Members earlier, I wonder whether this provision will actually help or hurt the distressed family more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally, to end off, I would like to make a general comment about homes instituted under the Children and Young Persons Act. I note that under the existing arrangements, the same institution could be gazetted for a variety of purposes under the Act. For instance, the Singapore Girls' Home is a place of safety and an approved home, an approved school as well as a place of detention. Is it right for us to put all these different children, with different needs, in the same institution? The children in need of care and protection were removed from their parents to be placed in a place of safety.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2128</p>Should we not separate them from those who have committed offences?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the hon. Members for their thoughtful contributions.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef asked about licensing fees. We will charge a nominal $12 a year, $1 a month, and bear in mind the fact that MCYS is actually funding the VWOs. I think you will agree with me that the licensing fee is not an issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Review Board, it will consist of a multi-disciplinary team, in order to provide all the necessary insights into the cases being reviewed. We would, of course, have to go on a massive recruitment campaign to get enough people in order to ensure that every case is reviewed appropriately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah, and I believe also others, asked whether the formulation of section 4(c) is too broad and whether there would be different standards on what constitutes adequate care. A political point was raised by Ms Sylvia Lim and she asked whether this will result in poor families being exposed to a higher risk of being broken up. &nbsp;I think we need to put this lie to&nbsp;rest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are trying to protect children. Children, through no fault of their own, will sometimes be exposed to risks or harm and neglect.&nbsp; The greatest danger is to assume that it is a natural reflex that all of us will look after our children or the corollary to that is to use poverty or some other social disadvantage as an alibi for neglect and&nbsp;that somehow excuses the family from being held accountable for care. So, I want to state this categorically that this is not about a group of child protection officers imposing middle-class values on poor families and using that as an excuse or&nbsp;a pretext to take children away from their families. That is not the<p align=left>Column: 2129</p>intention and I want to reiterate that categorically.What we are after is simply to identify children at risk and to take appropriate actions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, I think Mdm Halimah Yacob&nbsp;has a valid point when she asked what is the definition of \"adequate\". Well, the working definition for \"adequate\" will actually be a very basic threshold. In other words, what is necessary for the child's survival, physical development, emotional and psychological help. It is at a basic level.&nbsp; We are not saying that everybody needs to be at the middle-class or upper middle-class level in order to look after their children. In fact, I would go so far as to state that there are many&nbsp;&ndash; in fact, the vast majority of poor families are well able to take care of their children.&nbsp; Usually when there&nbsp; is child abuse, the dysfunctionality relates more to values and relationships, and not to poverty. So, please do not raise poverty as a \"bogeyman\" in this debate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have also been questions about safeguards. When you read the Bill, it appears that the Director of Social Welfare has got enormous powers at his or her disposal. But the due process is that every case is discussed at the multi-disciplinary platform within the Ministry, in order to tap the different and relevant professional perspectives and the views of the team. In other words, this is not a case of one-man or one-woman's decision being imposed unilaterally.&nbsp; I would also go on to emphasise what I said earlier, that the removal of a child is the last resort. In fact, even if you were to look at this purely from a utilitarian perspective, it is far more efficient, far more effective and, ultimately, also the morally right thing to do, to bring up a child within the context of an intact family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I give Members the assurance that all our child protection officers, wherever possible, wherever it is safe, wherever it <p align=left>Column: 2130</p>is practical, will do their best to ensure that the child is looked after in the context of an intact family. And I also give&nbsp;Members the&nbsp;commitment that the reason Child Protection Service is under MCYS is because where additional resources&nbsp;&ndash; financial, emotional and social&nbsp;&ndash; are necessary in order to support and empower the family to look after the child,&nbsp;MCYS will do so. And I make that assurance in this House to all of you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been questions of what constitutes emotional and psychological abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that is difficult to define easily but, again, I would go on a practical basis and I think that anything that causes damage to the behavioural, social, cognitive, affective or physical functioning of a child, including things like terrorising a child, rejecting or degrading a child, isolating, exploiting or corrupting a child would constitute emotional or physical abuse.&nbsp; I think most Members here,&nbsp;in this House, would agree with that definition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been much talk on this issue of voluntary care agreement and that is why I took pains to go into at length in my opening speech.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Again, I want to emphasise that this is not an attempt to take children away from their families without judicial review.&nbsp; That is not the intention at all.&nbsp; In fact, as I alluded to earlier, it is intended to provide for early intervention and early support to be given to the families to work out collaboratively with their families what are their needs, how can we support their needs in order to better look after and protect their children.&nbsp; If children need to be removed, and that is the last resort, we will go to Court.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me cite you&nbsp;some actual numbers so that you get an idea what actually happens on the ground in Singapore.&nbsp; &nbsp;In 2009, there were 169 cases that were investigated by the Child Protection Service.&nbsp; Of the 169 cases, 124 <p align=left>Column: 2131</p>of the allegations were substantiated.&nbsp; That is actually quite a high number.&nbsp; Of these 124 cases that were substantiated, however, only one-third &ndash; 60 of them &ndash; proceeded&nbsp;to a formal care and protection order&nbsp;awarded by the Court.&nbsp; In these 60 cases, we had no choice but to do so because of the seriousness of the abuse.&nbsp; What about the others?&nbsp; The remaining cases were assessed &ndash; first, that the allegations were substantiated; secondly, we will assess that there were welfare concerns that had to be addressed and it had to be escalated so that the children would have access to further child protection measures.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Child Protection Service therefore works with these families together with the support of other community agencies to address these concerns and formulate a concrete plan of action in which support and assistance would be given to improve the family situation, proper supervision and monitoring of the child's welfare was in place and that we have created a synergistic partnership between&nbsp;child protection officers, parents and the community organisations and&nbsp;the&nbsp;resources.&nbsp; So this is actually what happens on the ground and I am glad to report that, in fact, the majority of the families are actually very cooperative because they do want what is best for their child.&nbsp; You know, the key to solving this problem is to acknowledge that there is a problem, and then to commit to resolving the problem to the best of his or her ability as a parent and together with the support and supervision of the community organisations and the child protection officers.&nbsp; So that is what is going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to reassure Members that all this is not a back-door attempt to remove children from their families without judicial oversight.&nbsp; That is absolutely not the intention at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were questions on&nbsp;not complying with the bond and the penalty.&nbsp; I think both Mdm Halimah Yacob and Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef asked about it: <p align=left>Column: 2132</p>whether the proposed penalty would end up being punitive and make it more difficult for the families.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a child or young person established by the Court to be in need of care or protection, it means, by definition, that there are already sufficient concerns about the child's welfare.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Act provides that the Court may order the parents or guardian to enter into a bond to ensure the proper care and guardianship of the child.&nbsp; Now, we all know we tend to put a dollar value to bonds but the real issue when&nbsp;we are imposing&nbsp;a bond is to impose a change in behaviour &ndash; to incentivise, to persuade and focus the minds of the families that a change in behaviour is needed in order to improve the outcome for the child.&nbsp; I do not think the Court derives any satisfaction from collecting or levying the penalty for failure to discharge the bond but, nevertheless, we do need to have a system in which there are both incentives and penalties if parents do not comply with the recommended changes which are necessary in order to protect their children.&nbsp; So that is what it is about.&nbsp; It is not about money, it is about a change in behaviour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob also brought up a very valid point about&nbsp;coordination between agencies. Unfortunately, we all know about&nbsp;the case that the Member referred to when the father was released from jail years after his initial offence and then re-victimised his daughter.&nbsp; This tragic case illustrates the need for greater and stronger inter-agency management and flow of information.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure you all the relevant agencies have learnt their lessons from that case.&nbsp; Our agencies will work closely to make sure that there is an integrated and comprehensive community safety net for victims and we will also commit to working in the long term for the safety of these potential victims.&nbsp; Simply because a case has been identified, prosecuted and jailed is not the end of the story.&nbsp; Family relationships go on for a long time and it may be that <p align=left>Column: 2133</p>there are some families that are in need of long-term supervision.&nbsp; So we will have to maintain a register, that is internally within the Ministry, of such cases, and we will also work with our other agencies.&nbsp; So I will give you an example of that.&nbsp; We have this thing called the child abuse protection team.&nbsp; This team includes the Police, medical social workers from the hospitals, psychologists and other professionals, and it meets weekly for case discussions.&nbsp; Where relevant, the teachers, the school counsellors, the staff from the Children and Young Persons Homes are also invited to participate in a discussion where relevant and where the cases involve their oversight.&nbsp; This child abuse protection team has proven to be an effective and is an ongoing feature of our child protection system.&nbsp; Besides this team, we have also set up another team that meets on a regular basis to discuss the ongoing progress of individual cases.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is called the child abuse review team.&nbsp; This is attended by child protection officers and managers, professionals with experience in the child protection sector as well as others who are involved in the management of the specific case who have detailed knowledge of that individual case.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me conclude by coming back to first principles.&nbsp; It is still about families and about parents discharging their responsibility.&nbsp; We recognise that some families will need additional help in order to discharge those responsibilities and we will do so through policy and through operations run through MCYS.&nbsp; Having said that, this is not a simple case where you penalise people if they do not fulfil their end of the bargain because there is this other element called a \"child or young person\" whose interest we are committing in this House with this amendment to put paramount.&nbsp; What that means is that sometimes we will have to achieve a difficult balance &ndash;&nbsp;a balance between <p align=left>Column: 2134</p>fairness, due process, the rights of the parents versus the real danger and risk of neglect or harm to children.&nbsp; We have to get the balance right.&nbsp;&nbsp;I, as the Minister for MCYS, would confess to having a bias and, if in doubt, I would rather err on the side of safety for children.&nbsp; Nevertheless, what we have is a system with proper checks and balances, proper reviews and a system which is sufficiently resourced to make sure that people who need help get help and children who need protection will be protected.&nbsp; But, again, I want to emphasise that this is something which we cannot do alone and it is not something which we can do with legislation.&nbsp; This is something we have do as a community.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Cycling modal share can vary quite significantly depending on very localised factors. For instance, cities like New York, Sydney and London have mode shares between 0.5% to 3%, while cities which are known to be extremely bicycle-friendly such as Amsterdam, Munich and Copenhagen have mode shares ranging from 13% to 29%(3) .<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from the facilitative role which Government plays in promoting cycling in some of these cities, there are many defining factors which influence and determine the modal share of cycling. Some of these factors would include geographical landscape, culture, climate and road use patterns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, cycling has gained popularity among our citizens and has evolved into an alternative option for short-distance trips in local areas, linking commuters from residential areas to major transport nodes such as MRT stations and bus interchanges. We have also observed that most cycling trips made are intra-town trips to transport nodes and key amenities such as town centres or neighbourhood centres which are within a distance of 3 km&nbsp;to 5 km.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition that cycling can be positioned as a non-motorised transport option especially for intra-town short trips and potentially enlarge the catchment to transport nodes such as RTS stations, we have launched the National Cycling Plan in July 2010. As part of the plans, we will be implementing cycling infrastructure starting with seven towns, focusing on the development of dedicated off-road intra-town cycling paths to major transport nodes and key amenities, and enhancing bicycle parking facilities. There is also a longer term plan to implement an extensive network of cycling paths in Marina Bay.<p align=left>Column: 2141</p>In addition, to complement these efforts, the Cycling Facilitation Committee, which&nbsp;the Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Teo Ser Luck chairs, adopts a Government-community partnership approach to provide guidance on the \"software\" aspects such as safe cycling, public education and enforcement issues, and other best practices to facilitate cycling in these seven towns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from these efforts to facilitate cycling, we will continue to work with the community to progressively roll out cycling initiatives and cycling infrastructure to other parts of the island. We do not have a pre-determined target cycling modal share, but we would plan and scale up the infrastructure to support cycling at a pace that meets the needs of the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p><font size=\"2\">(3)</font> Source: Pucher and Buehler \"Making Cycling Irresistible\" Transport Reviews, Vol. 28, 2008.</p><BR></div></P></div><p align=left>Column: 2141<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:COMPLAINTS ON MOBILE TELEPHONE RECEPTION--><!--END_COL_TITLE:COMPLAINTS ON MOBILE TELEPHONE RECEPTION:::2144--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>COMPLAINTS ON MOBILE TELEPHONE RECEPTION</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan </B>asked the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts how many complaints have been lodged with the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) in the past 12 months about poor mobile telephone reception.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Mr Lim for his interest in the standard of mobile telephone service coverage, and would like to take this opportunity to explain the measures to safeguard consumers' interests.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Infocomm Development Authority (IDA), has received a total of 91 complaints on mobile telephone service coverage from January to October last year.&nbsp; This forms 11.2% of the total complaints received by IDA.&nbsp; One of the issues highlighted was an inability to make calls due to low signal strength, and poor service coverage within buildings.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, mobile operators have to comply with the Quality of Service (QoS) standards that IDA has set out to ensure acceptable mobile telephone service coverage.&nbsp; There are two key QoS standards: (i) 95% coverage on street level and in tunnels, and (ii) 85% coverage at public access areas within buildings(4).&nbsp; Public access areas include (a) main lobby areas, (b) high human traffic areas, such as podium floors, multi-storey car-parks, and basement levels with services for the public(5), as well as (c) basement car park areas.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The in-building coverage QoS requirements do not apply to areas within private buildings that are not publicly accessible, such as private offices and residences.&nbsp; This is because owners of private properties would sometimes refuse to allow mobile operators access to their property to install the necessary equipment that would boost radio coverage.&nbsp; While the current arrangement is for mobile operators and property owners to commercially negotiate on how best to provide better service coverage within these private areas, IDA would actively request mobile operators to look into ways to improve service coverage when there is feedback on poor coverage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The QoS standards are measured monthly, and IDA requires mobile operators to submit QoS reports every quarter to show compliance.&nbsp; IDA also conducts audits on operators' QoS performances.&nbsp; Mobile operators who fail to comply with IDA's QoS<p align=left>Column: 2143</p>standards may be fined.

and (b) whether the Ministry intends to encourage private sector's support to develop more rehearsal, studio, and performance or exhibition spaces for Singapore arts sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></span><p align=left>Column: 2147<p>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Ms Audrey Wong for her interest in the future direction of the NAC in providing support for artists and arts groups. Ms Wong's question raises two key issues: first, whether the new Framework for Arts Spaces would lead to a change in NAC's existing grant schemes; second, whether there is intention to encourage private and community support for arts spaces. I will address these points in turn.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent changes to the Arts Housing Scheme are necessary and part of a rigorous policy review process to ensure that NAC's support schemes for artists and arts groups stay relevant and efficient. To achieve this, the NAC had conducted extensive public consultation sessions with the arts sector during the review of the Arts Housing Scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One recurrent feedback that we have received was that the one-size-fits-all Arts Housing Scheme could not meet the different needs of artists and arts groups at their various stages of development.&nbsp; In particular, new and emerging arts groups had little or no access.&nbsp; Indeed, in the 2009/10 report of the Auditor-General, it was noted that arts housing resources could be better optimised.&nbsp; AGO noted that more than 50% of Arts Housing tenants had occupied their premises for over 10 years, with more than one in five of these having occupied them for more than 20 years.&nbsp; There was clearly a need to introduce more targeted schemes to cater to the diverse requirements and aspirations of the whole spectrum of artists and arts groups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the enhancements NAC will introduce include the Incubation Scheme, which provides young and emerging artists and arts groups a chance to test out their ideas. For developing artists or arts groups, more stability is critical to give them time to deepen their artistic programmes and build up their base of audiences and supporters. For mature artists or arts groups who may have the capacity and vision to contribute beyond producing their own practises, NAC will partner them with facilities that support their work in developing the next generation of practitioners or building deeper engagement with the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with any new scheme being introduced, there may be uncertainties among some stakeholders as to how the changes will affect them, including how the new Framework may affect the existing perks and grants they currently enjoy.&nbsp; There is no immediate plan to radically revise NAC's other grant schemes, as a result of the introduction of the new Framework for Arts Spaces.&nbsp; Instead, the new Framework will complement NAC's current arsenal of support, such as grants, scholarships and other capability development initiatives that help artists and arts groups develop their art, achieve greater sustainability and reach out to audiences.&nbsp; Any major revisions to these other support schemes will be done in close consultation with the various stakeholders.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I welcome Ms Wong's suggestion to encourage private and community support for arts spaces.&nbsp; Indeed, a significant component of the new Framework for Arts Spaces looks beyond the properties under NAC, to spaces and facilities in the private, public and people sector that can be tapped on to create new spaces for the arts and the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan is to house artists and arts groups within communities in each of the&nbsp;three regional centres and in each of the&nbsp;four sub-regional centres outside of the city centre by 2015.&nbsp; The NAC has begun conversations with partners to match artists and arts groups with communities where they can be involved in the project conceptualisation and design <p align=left>Column: 2149<p>development of new civic spaces and facilities. This endeavour will help artists and arts groups generate more community support and present artistic creations that entertain, enrich and inspire Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, NAC is stepping up its facilitation role to first, co-locate artists and arts groups within commercial developments such as shopping centres or mixed use creative clusters and second, for artists and arts groups to tap on existing facilities in schools, community and commercial buildings, vacant state properties for project and short-term needs.&nbsp; The latter was echoed by the arts community during the public consultation exercise, who articulated that there is scope to tap on state properties or spaces in Government-sponsored institutions that may not be fully utilised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Arts and Culture Strategic Review (ACSR) Steering Committee, led by Mr Lee Tzu Yang, Chairman, School of the Arts, is also looking at ways to encourage community and corporate support and partnerships in the mid- to long-term as an important component of the review, and will publish its full recommendations after the review.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to assure Ms Audrey Wong that we will carefully consider all feedback and consult with stakeholders to ensure that our support measures remain relevant to the arts industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 2149<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:BUKIT PANJANG LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT SYSTEM--><!--END_COL_TITLE:BUKIT PANJANG LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT SYSTEM:::2152--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>BUKIT PANJANG LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT SYSTEM</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Liang Eng Hwa </B>asked the Minister for Transport (a) for the past three years, what is the number breakdown occurrences at the Bukit Panjang Light Rail Transit (BPLRT) and how long are the stoppages; (b) whether the BPLRT system has met the level of service standards required; and (c) whether there are adequate back-up plans to assist commuters in the event of a breakdown.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2008 to November 2010, BPLRT experienced 32 disruptions exceeding 10 minutes.&nbsp; Of these disruptions,&nbsp;eight lasted more than 30 minutes.&nbsp; The longest disruption lasted for&nbsp;four hours in September 2009. The majority of these disruptions were the result of technical faults to the signalling system or trains, and the remainder were due to track intrusions or extreme weather events.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The operator, SMRT Light Rail Pte Ltd, is required to meet the Operating Performance Standards (OPS) prescribed by the LTA.&nbsp; Amongst others, the operator is required to comply with the System Service Availability (SSA) standard, which stipulates the availability of LRT services at 99.5% in any month.&nbsp; Over the last&nbsp;three years, BPLRT has met the SSA standard, averaging 99.93% monthly.&nbsp; In months in which the breakdowns occur, the system availability falls, but the operator has managed to recover the services such that they have been able to meet the 99.5% availability requirement for the month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the occurrence of any disruption is an inconvenience to commuters.&nbsp; The LTA works proactively with the operator on measures to ensure that the expected level of service delivery can be maintained.&nbsp; On its part, the operator carries out regular and preventive maintenance for BPLRT, including pre-emptive replacement of critical equipment based on manufacturers' recommendations.&nbsp; The operator is also engaging <p align=left>Column: 2151<p>Bombadier, the original equipment manufacturer of the BPLRT, to study how the reliability of the BPLRT system can be further improved.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of these measures, service disruptions occur from time to time.&nbsp; In the case of breakdowns, the operator has a comprehensive Rail Incident Management Plan (RIMP) and Standing Operating Procedures (SOPs) to manage the situation, and minimise inconvenience to commuters.&nbsp; This includes helping commuters disembark safely, providing timely updates to the public, ensuring prompt restoration of services and providing alternative forms of transport like free bus bridging services for disruptions exceeding 30 minutes. In addition, the operator works with various agencies such as the Singapore Civil Defence Force to ensure that these plans are updated regularly, to ensure their relevance in dealing with various scenarios. In the most recent incident in November 2010 which was reported in the media, commuters had to be evacuated by walking along the viaduct. SMRT staff were deployed to guide passengers back to the station platforms. I assure you that the commuters were safe at all times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would also like to assure Mr Liang that the LTA remains committed to ensuring the delivery of quality service to commuters, and will continue to monitor the service levels on the BPLRT closely.</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\"><!--SECTION_NAME:WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS--><p align=left>Column: 2153<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B><P>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</P></span></B></div>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEMES IN THE CIVIL SERVICE--><!--END_COL_TITLE:FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEMES IN THE CIVIL SERVICE:::2154--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEMES IN THE CIVIL SERVICE</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mdm Halimah Yacob </B>asked the Prime Minister (a) whether he will provide&nbsp; an&nbsp; update&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; flexible&nbsp; work&nbsp; schemes&nbsp; available&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil Service; and (b) how these have benefited employees to cope better with their work-life balance.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's multi-generational workforce has varying and unique work-life needs.&nbsp; In cognisance of this, the Civil Service has a broad range of policies and programmes to support a culture of flexibility in working arrangements. These include the flexi-time policy, which allows officers to vary the start and end times of their work hours, contingent on the completion of 42 hours of work a week. Most of our agencies have also introduced telecommuting, leveraging on technology to enable our officers to work off-site.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have a part-time employment scheme where officers can opt for an 11- to 36-hour work-week with pro-rated salaries and benefits. The number of part-time officers has substantially increased over the years, from 388 in 2007 to 813 in 2010.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building a culture of flexibility takes time, as it involves cultivating mindsets that openly embrace flexible work practices. Over the past few years, there have been gradual but positive improvements in this area. The findings from our biennial survey show that officers are becoming more aware of the various work-life practices and policies in their organisations. Between 2005 and 2009, there was a 7% point increase (46% to 53%) in the proportion of civil servants who felt that their agencies were successful in helping officers achieve work-life harmony. Over the same period, there was also an 11% point jump in the proportion of civil servants (53% to 64%) who felt they were better able to balance their work and family commitments. More also reported that they were able to find time for family, friends, and things they enjoy doing. They were also coping well with their workload and found their stress levels manageable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The survey also revealed that supervisors were becoming more supportive of flexible working arrangements. Almost two in three officers indicated that their supervisors would support them if they requested for flexi-time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While these are positive developments, we will continue to communicate the message of flexibility through the agencies' Work Life Ambassadors. In particular, we are now focusing our efforts on our middle managers as they have direct influence over the way they manage their staff. Through our communication and education efforts, we hope to see a more enabling and flexible work culture within the Service that supports both the organisation and the individual.&nbsp;</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 2153<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:HEALTH IMPACT STUDIES FOR NEWATER--><!--END_COL_TITLE:HEALTH IMPACT STUDIES FOR NEWATER:::2156--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>HEALTH IMPACT STUDIES FOR NEWATER</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Seah Kian Peng </B>asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the Government has conducted any health impact studies on the introduction of Newater into our drinking supply; and (b) whether there are any statistics on the water drinking habits of Singaporeans to monitor if more people have been buying bottled water and water filters since the introduction of Newater.</P></span><p align=left>Column: 2155<p>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

As part of the licensing requirements, dealers must keep a record of the sales of such items, including the purchaser's particulars.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The knives that were used in the recent gang-related incidents included common household knives such as kitchen knives and meat cleavers. Restricting the sale of such knives to young people will not have much practical impact given that these items can be <p align=left>Column: 2161<p>obtained from their homes.&nbsp; Youths can also use other items such as bottles and wooden sticks to inflict hurt.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more practical approach would be to address the possession of weapons in public places, where there is intent to use the weapons in an offensive manner.&nbsp; There are already laws in place to this effect. Under the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act, an offensive weapon is defined as any instrument likely to cause hurt if used as a weapon of offence.&nbsp; The penalties for those convicted of possessing any offensive weapon in a public place without lawful purpose or authority are severe. These include mandatory imprisonment of up to three years; and mandatory caning of not less than six strokes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the offensive weapon is further listed as a Scheduled Weapon, such as flick knives, parangs and knuckledusters, first-time offenders convicted will face even more severe penalties, <I>viz</I>, mandatory imprisonment of up to five years; and mandatory caning of not less than six strokes. Repeat offenders will face even harsher punishments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police have the powers to arrest persons, including young persons, for the possession of offensive weapons in public if these persons do not have valid reasons for carrying such items and if there are grounds to suspect that they have committed or intend to commit crimes.&nbsp; To illustrate, following a STOMP posting, two male youths aged 16 and 17 were arrested for brandishing a knife whilst onboard an MRT train. The youths were arrested for Unlawful Possession of Offensive Weapons and Consorting with Persons with Offensive Weapons under section 6(1) and section 8(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act respectively. Investigations are ongoing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue of youth violence is a multi-faceted one and cannot be tackled just by regulation and enforcement against the sale and possession of sharp implements alone. It is critical for us to tackle the issue of youth gang violence by going to the root of the problem and disrupting the formation of youth gangs.&nbsp; I had informed the House in November that MHA is studying whether Police require additional powers to intervene upstream.&nbsp; We also need to continue to invest in preventive and rehabilitative efforts for at-risk youths and youth offenders.&nbsp; My Ministry will continue to work with agencies such as the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, the Central Youth Guidance Office and the community to jointly tackle this issue.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 2161<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:IMPROVING WORK CONDITIONS IN THE SERVICES SECTOR--><!--END_COL_TITLE:IMPROVING WORK CONDITIONS IN THE SERVICES SECTOR:::2164--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>IMPROVING WORK CONDITIONS IN THE SERVICES SECTOR</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo </B>asked the Minister Manpower in a bid to attract&nbsp; more&nbsp; Singaporeans into the services&nbsp; sector (a) how the Government plans to address the following issues associated with the service industry&nbsp; such&nbsp; as&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; health&nbsp; and&nbsp; safety&nbsp; safeguards,&nbsp; poor&nbsp; pay,&nbsp; poor working conditions and long working hours; and (b) whether there is room for Singapore to follow countries such as Australia and the US in terms of their per-hour pay scheme in the service industries.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services sector covers a wide range of industries and workplace practices vary across industries, even across companies in the same industry. Each industry faces different challenges and requires different strategies to address. Nevertheless, our laws&nbsp;&ndash; such as the Employment Act and the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act&nbsp;&ndash; ensure <p align=left>Column: 2163<p>that workers enjoy the basic workplace environment and statutory employment benefits. In 2010, 23 employers in the services sector were convicted of Employment Act offences.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides enforcing minimum employment standards, MOM engages companies to create greater awareness of our employment laws and good employment practices. MOM also works closely with relevant agencies to put in place initiatives to professionalise certain industries and improve working conditions. For example, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) subjects security guard agencies to mandatory grading, while the National Environment Agency (NEA) introduced a voluntary accreditation framework in 2010 for cleaning companies. Through the inclusion of employment practices and training efforts into the grading and accreditation criteria, we have helped to improve the wages and employment conditions of workers in these industries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skills upgrading, complemented with job and process redesign, can bring about productivity improvements to support higher wages and set workers on a sustainable path to income growth. The Workfare Training Support (WTS) Scheme was launched in 2010 to provide higher training grants to employers and older low-wage workers, and rewards workers for sustaining their training efforts. In addition, WDA has developed Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) training pathways to allow workers to upgrade and progress. The Government has also extended $40 million to fund NTUC's Inclusive Growth Programme (IGP). Initiatives under the IGP include job redesign, promotion of best-sourcing practices as well as support for the adoption of productivity-related initiatives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of workplace safety and health, the WSH Act currently covers certain services-related industries including healthcare activities, hotels and restaurants, landscape care and maintenance service activities, among others. We will be seeking the support of this House to amend the WSH Act to cover all workplaces(1) later this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM and the Workplace Safety and Health Council have been engaging stakeholders to share on their responsibilities under WSH Act&nbsp;and what they need to do to meet these obligations. Key initiatives include the provision of WSH advisory to companies through the WSH Clinics, dedicated informational packages to employers, and innovative promotional activities such as skits at public places.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The per-hour pay scheme suggested by the member is allowed under the Employment Act and has been adopted by companies in certain service industries. Companies that adopt more regularised salary payments such as on a monthly basis to provide greater stability and security for their workers may also pay over-time on hourly basis. The Ministry does not dictate the wage systems of companies, but leaves it to employers to choose the structure that is most appropriate for the nature of their industry.&nbsp;</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p><font size=\"2\">(1)</font> &nbsp;(i) Any member of the Singapore Police Force (including the Special Constabulary), Singapore Prisons Service, Internal Security Department, Central Narcotics Bureau, Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Civil Defence Force and the Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority while on duty, and (ii) any crew member at work on board any ship, aircraft or any other international mode of transport will continue to be excluded from WSHA coverage.</p><BR></div></P></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag --><!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES--><p align=left>Column: 2165<p><P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
