When\r\n\r\nsecond-timers  sold  their first  subsidised  flat,  they\r\n\r\nwould  have  cashed in the subsidy that they  enjoyed  on\r\n\r\ntheir  first  flat.  The resale levy therefore  helps  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  over-consumption of public housing  subsidies\r\n\r\nby   these  second-timer  families.   This  ensures  that\r\n\r\nhousing  subsidies are fairly allocated between them  and\r\n\r\nfirst-timer  families,  who have  more  pressing  housing\r\n\r\nneeds.   I  must  emphasise  that  flat  owners  are  not\r\n\r\nrequired to pay the resale levy if they do not purchase a\r\n\r\nsecond subsidised flat from the HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resale levy collected by the HDB is used to\r\n\r\npartially   offset  its  expenditure  on  home  ownership\r\n\r\nsubsidies.   The amount collected during  the  period  FY\r\n\r\n1992  to  FY  2001 can be found in HDB's annual  reports.\r\n\r\nThe  average  amount  collected per year  is  about  $170\r\n\r\nmillion.  This is a small sum when we compare it  to  the\r\n\r\nnet amount of $750 million per year that the HDB incurred\r\n\r\nover  the  same  period to subsidise its  home  ownership\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resale levy is graded so that lessees of smaller\r\n\r\nflats,  whom  we  recognise may have a  greater  need  to\r\n\r\nupgrade,  pay a lower levy rate.  The subsidy enjoyed  by\r\n\r\nthese families is still attractive compared to the resale\r\n\r\nlevy  that they have to pay.  And, in fact, this  is  why\r\n\r\nsecond-timer  families return to the  HDB  for  a  second\r\n\r\nsubsidised flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home ownership has always been an important facet of\r\n\r\nour public housing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npolicy.   It  has  helped  us to achieve  greater  social\r\n\r\nstability  and  engendered  a  sense  of  community   and\r\n\r\nbelonging  to  Singapore.  There is  a  need  for  us  to\r\n\r\nbalance  the  allocation of our home ownership  subsidies\r\n\r\ncarefully,  to ensure that they go to those who  need  it\r\n\r\nmost.   The  resale  levy policy  is  an  important  tool\r\n\r\nthrough  which we achieve this.  It is still relevant  in\r\n\r\ntoday's context, and therefore we have no plans to review\r\n\r\nor remove it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, four supplementary questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in view of new flats being sold for almost\r\n\r\n$1/2  million  in  the market, what is  the  Government's\r\n\r\nsubsidy per unit for a flat costing almost $1/2 million?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, where the subsidy is through a Government\r\n\r\ngrant of up to $50,000 for staying near the parents,  the\r\n\r\nresale levy imposed can be seen to be more than two times\r\n\r\nthe  grant given for bigger units.  The question is:   is\r\n\r\nHDB  aiming to profit from this grant if the levy is more\r\n\r\nthan  $50,000?   Can  the homeowner have  the  option  of\r\n\r\nreturning the grant instead of paying the levy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, for owners who are not sure whether they want\r\n\r\nto  get a second bite of the subsidised cherry flat,  but\r\n\r\nthey  are  not making a profit from the subsidised  flat,\r\n\r\ncan this resale flat levy policy be waived for them?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> I thought he said he had\r\n\r\nfour supplementary questions.  I counted three.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the subsidy which HDB provides is in the form\r\n\r\nof  a  market subsidy, and that is clear to anyone buying\r\n\r\nan   HDB   flat,  because  they  know  that   when   they\r\n\r\nsubsequently sell it after the minimum occupation period,\r\n\r\nthey  sell  it at a price which is higher than what  they\r\n\r\noriginally purchased from HDB.  It is a matter of  timing\r\n\r\nand definition as to exactly how much that sum is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that the resale levy is not a capital\r\n\r\ngains tax.  It is not related to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnotional  or actual profit that you would have made  from\r\n\r\ncashing  in  your  subsidy..  This is a  policy  tool  to\r\n\r\nensure that people do not unnecessarily come back  for  a\r\n\r\nsecond  bite of the subsidy cherry.  At the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nday,  remember  that  there  is  a  finite  amount  which\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  direct towards housing  subsidies.   The\r\n\r\nmore we allocate to people taking a second bite, the less\r\n\r\nwe have for people who are taking a first bite.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Steve Chia's supplementary questions are\r\n\r\nmissing  this point.  It is not a matter of how much  the\r\n\r\nhomeowner actually made when he sold his flat, nor is  it\r\n\r\na  matter of whether it was a profit or a loss.  It is  a\r\n\r\nmatter   of  directing  people  so  that  they   do   not\r\n\r\nunnecessarily consume housing subsidies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, may I\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister of State whether the HDB will consider\r\n\r\nreducing  the  resale  levy for 3-room  flats  so  as  to\r\n\r\nencourage  growing families staying in  3-room  flats  to\r\n\r\nupgrade to a 4-room flat?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since May\r\n\r\n1977,  the  resale levy for a 3-room flat  is  20%.   For\r\n\r\npeople  who do their sums, it is still financially viable\r\n\r\nfor  them to sell their 3-room flat and subsequently come\r\n\r\nback for a second bite of a subsidised HDB 4-, 5-room  or\r\n\r\nExecutive flat, and they will still be ahead financially.\r\n\r\nSo,  the levy, in that sense, is not an impediment or  an\r\n\r\nobstacle to them upgrading.  Obviously, because the  levy\r\n\r\nis  graduated, for those who are already in 4- or  5-room\r\n\r\nflats,  depending on the exact circumstances of the  case\r\n\r\nand on the timing of the sale and purchase, it may not be\r\n\r\nsensible for them to come back for a second bite  of  the\r\n\r\ncherry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, the Minister of State\r\n\r\nhas not answered my question on the unit subsidy per flat\r\n\r\nfor  those  flats that are sold for almost $1/2  million.\r\n\r\nThe Minister for National Development had been quoted  in\r\n\r\nthe  papers  as saying that a $150,000 new flat  is  very\r\n\r\naffordable  in the market.  So, what is the subsidy  that\r\n\r\nthe Government is giving for this flat?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question that the Minister of State has\r\n\r\nnot  answered me is:  will the Ministry consider  waiving\r\n\r\nthe resale levy when the houseowner actually makes a loss\r\n\r\nwhen selling his subsidised flat?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am unable\r\n\r\nto  give  him  the  exact number for  the  subsidy  of  a\r\n\r\nnotional flat which is sold for $1/2 million, because  it\r\n\r\ndepends  on where the flat is and when it was bought.   I\r\n\r\ncannot give him a specific number to that question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second question is on whether the levy can be\r\n\r\nwaived.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Whether the houseowner has\r\n\r\nthe  option to return the $50,000 grant if the  grant  is\r\n\r\nactually lower than the resale levy that he has to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> He cannot subsequently\r\n\r\ndecide  that  he does not want the housing grant  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  place and therefore is not affected by the  resale\r\n\r\nlevy  policy.

We have\r\n\r\na  clear  set  of  policies.  Remember  that  no  one  is\r\n\r\ncompelled to buy a flat from the HDB.  Even if  a  person\r\n\r\nwants to buy an HDB flat, he is not compelled to come and\r\n\r\nbuy a subsidised flat from the HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more important point, in fact, about the resale\r\n\r\nlevy  is  that if a homeowner does not come  back  for  a\r\n\r\nsecond  subsidised flat, he cashes out the housing  grant\r\n\r\nand  he  does  not  have to pay any levy.   That  is  the\r\n\r\nimportant point.  It is entirely up to them to  do  their\r\n\r\nsums and decide what is sensible and what is not.  We are\r\n\r\nnot  here  to  create a system in which people  can  play\r\n\r\ngames  with  the  rules, change the rules retrospectively\r\n\r\nand decide which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nones apply to them and which do not apply to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, owners are not sure\r\n\r\nwhether they want to buy a second subsidised flat but  it\r\n\r\nis  very  certain that their first subsidised  flat  that\r\n\r\nthey  bought from the HDB was at a higher price when  the\r\n\r\nmarket  was  very high.  Subsequently, five years  later,\r\n\r\nwhen  they  sell  the  flat, it is actually  below  their\r\n\r\npurchase price, effectively, making a loss.  If they  are\r\n\r\nnot   very  sure  whether  they  want  to  buy  a  second\r\n\r\nsubsidised  flat, then they would need to  pay  the  levy\r\n\r\nupfront.   For  such a case, will the Minister  of  State\r\n\r\nconsider  waiving  the levy?  Because, effectively,  they\r\n\r\nmade a loss from buying and selling a subsidised flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Sir, it is the same issue\r\n\r\nagain.   I  keep emphasising that this is not  a  tax  on\r\n\r\nprofit.   Whether a houseowner has made a profit or  loss\r\n\r\nis  irrelevant.  Let me state it explicitly.  The levy is\r\n\r\nto discourage people from coming back unnecessarily for a\r\n\r\nsecond bite of the subsidy cherry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chia, can you ask the next Question,\r\n\r\nplease?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Question 2, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SECOND PAY-TV AND SATELLITE DISHES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Acting\r\n\r\nMinister for Information, Communications and the Arts (a)\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the  reasons  allowing  for  a  second  pay-TV\r\n\r\noperator  to  enter  our  small  domestic  market,   when\r\n\r\nsatellite dishes will have been more cost-effective;  and\r\n\r\n(b)  when  will  satellite dishes  be  approved  for  the\r\n\r\nconsumer market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr Khaw Boon Wan) (for the Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Steve Chia is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncorrect in saying that Singapore's broadcasting market is\r\n\r\nsmall.   There  are  only one million  households.   This\r\n\r\nsmall market is further divided among various racial  and\r\n\r\nlanguage   groups.    That  is   why   the   Government's\r\n\r\nbroadcasting competition policy cannot simply copy  those\r\n\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach we have taken is to introduce\r\n\r\ncompetition incrementally.  Over the last seven years, we\r\n\r\nhave  had  a  single pay-TV operator.  That  has  allowed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to enjoy a much wider range of  programming\r\n\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now is whether the market can support a\r\n\r\nsecond  pay-TV  operator.  Our industry consultants  have\r\n\r\nstudied  the problem and concluded that the market  could\r\n\r\nsupport  one more operator.  This is why we have  decided\r\n\r\nto  offer just one additional pay-TV licence.  Even then,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot be sure that there is market interest in  this\r\n\r\nlicence, or that if awarded, the second licensee will  be\r\n\r\nviable.   However,  this is an assessment  best  left  to\r\n\r\ninterested industry parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upside of having a second pay-TV operator is\r\n\r\nthat  the competition would help to build a more  dynamic\r\n\r\nand  vibrant  media  industry  in  Singapore.   It  would\r\n\r\nencourage  greater  innovation and  experimentation.   It\r\n\r\nwould  also  facilitate  the  development  of  convergent\r\n\r\napplications  and  increase  the  sophistication  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore marketplace.  Consumers could benefit from  new\r\n\r\nand improved pay-TV service offerings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for our satellite dish policy, this has been\r\n\r\ndebated   several  times  in  this  House  before.    The\r\n\r\ninstallation  of  satellite  dishes  for  households  was\r\n\r\ndisallowed  to keep out undesirable content  that  is  at\r\n\r\nodds  with our multi-racial and multi-religious  society,\r\n\r\nand to prevent the influencing of Singapore politics from\r\n\r\na  distance.  This was why we built up the cable network,\r\n\r\nso that Singaporeans would nonetheless be able to enjoy a\r\n\r\nwider range of programmes.  Households have therefore not\r\n\r\nlost  out  on programming variety by not having satellite\r\n\r\nreception.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the reasons why we should not allow undesirable\r\n\r\ncontents  from  easy  access  to  the  living  rooms   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  through satellite dishes remain.   Security\r\n\r\nchallenges faced by the region, such as the uncovering of\r\n\r\nterrorist  networks here in Southeast Asia, have  brought\r\n\r\nhome  the  reality that we must continue to  be  vigilant\r\n\r\nagainst influences that may split or divide our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, since the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of State agrees that Singapore is a very  small\r\n\r\nmarket, is it not more cost-effective to allow individual\r\n\r\nhouseholds to install satellite dishes instead of  having\r\n\r\na second agency to do that?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question relates to the Senior Minister\r\n\r\nof State's reply about regulation of undesirable content.\r\n\r\nThere  seems to be a contradiction here, because  if  the\r\n\r\nMinistry does not seem to be able to regulate and control\r\n\r\nundesirable content on the Internet, especially with  the\r\n\r\nadvancement of broadband, why is there a need to  control\r\n\r\nsatellite?   Is there not inefficiency or a contradiction\r\n\r\nin the policy here?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the market is\r\n\r\nsmall, and Mr Steve Chia therefore argued that it is more\r\n\r\ncost-effective  to  just  allow  households  to  put   up\r\n\r\nsatellite dishes.  The most cost-effective means for them\r\n\r\nis  to  subscribe  to the existing pay-TV  operator.   Mr\r\n\r\nSteve  Chia  may  have  the impression  that  putting  up\r\n\r\nsatellite dishes is a cheap proposition.  It is not.  The\r\n\r\nfact  that  we are able to go for this current policy  of\r\n\r\ndisallowing satellite dishes by wiring up is  because  we\r\n\r\nare  quite  unique.   We  are a very  small  and  compact\r\n\r\ncountry.   This is one of those few advantages  of  being\r\n\r\nsmall.   If  we have a huge hinterland, like  most  other\r\n\r\ncountries,   our  current  policy  will  be   harder   to\r\n\r\nimplement.  But because we are small and compact,  it  is\r\n\r\nquite  inexpensive  for us to wire  up.   There  are  one\r\n\r\nmillion  homes and, in fact, more than 90% are  high-rise\r\n\r\nHDB  flats.   The cost of wiring up a home works  out  to\r\n\r\nless than - I am relying on memory here - $300\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nper home.  If you put up a dish, a good dish costs almost\r\n\r\n$1,000.   And  one  dish  can only receive  a  particular\r\n\r\nsatellite  up in the sky.  So if you want the full  works\r\n\r\nof  things, then you need several dishes per home.  So it\r\n\r\nis  not  cost-effective at all.  But, of course,  if  you\r\n\r\nhave  a  large country with huge rural areas, that  is  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  proposition.  Then insisting that banning  the\r\n\r\ndishes  and  wiring  up  everybody  may  not  be  a  good\r\n\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly for us is not only it is cost-effective to cable up, cabling up allows us new\r\n\r\nopportunities because at the end of the day, optic fibres\r\n\r\ncan  provide  a  much wider spectrum of frequencies  than\r\n\r\nwireless  can provide.  It is not quite there  yet  today\r\n\r\nbecause  the  signals  are still  analogue  but,  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse, I expect the cable network to turn digital.  Then\r\n\r\nyou  would have a wide spectrum of channels to work with.\r\n\r\nSo that is the reason why in Singapore, we go for cabling\r\n\r\nas  against allowing domestic homes to put up dishes.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  unique situation that we are facing, and it  is  a\r\n\r\nunique  advantage  that we are exploiting.   Whether  the\r\n\r\nmarket,  as  I  said,  can accommodate  a  second  pay-TV\r\n\r\noperator  using  some  other platforms,  it  is  for  the\r\n\r\nindustry  to decide.  Technologically, it is possible  to\r\n\r\ngo  on  a  second platform using copper wires  (telephone\r\n\r\nwires),  which  are  already into every  home  with  ADSL\r\n\r\ntechnology.  But that is for the market to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia's second point that there is a\r\n\r\ncontradiction,  that  with  Internet,  we  seem  helpless\r\n\r\nbecause  you can get any content that you want, then  why\r\n\r\nbother  to  tighten  up  on  satellite  transmission   of\r\n\r\nbroadcasting materials?  If Mr Steve Chia truly  believes\r\n\r\nthat  through Internet you can get all and sundry - I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know whether he subscribes to cable TV, but I  do  - and  there are 300,000-over families in Singapore who  do\r\n\r\nthe same thing - if he is right, that you can already get\r\n\r\nanything  that you want through Internet, then they  must\r\n\r\nbe  fools to subscribe to cable TV.  So, obviously,  this\r\n\r\nbanning of dishes has been effective and serves a  useful\r\n\r\npurpose.  And for as long as it does, the ban stays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>IRIS RECOGNITION SYSTEM</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs  (a) what is the reason for developing  and\r\n\r\ntesting  an  iris  recognition  system,  since  Singapore\r\n\r\nalready  has  the Immigration Automated Clearance  System\r\n\r\n(IACS) which is working effectively; (b) how much does it\r\n\r\ncost to develop each system; and (c) what will happen  to\r\n\r\nthe newly setup IACS.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Steve Chia asked why the Singapore\r\n\r\nImmigration and Registration is developing and testing an\r\n\r\niris  recognition  system when the Immigration  Automated\r\n\r\nClearance System (IACS) is working effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin by explaining what the IACS is about.\r\n\r\nThe  IACS  is  an automated immigration clearance  system\r\n\r\nthat  leverages on biometric technology to  identify  the\r\n\r\ntravellers.  The fingerprint of the traveller  is  stored\r\n\r\nin  a  smart card and then used to match the actual  live\r\n\r\nfingerprint presented by the traveller during immigration\r\n\r\nclearance.  ICAS not only does away with the need for  an\r\n\r\nimmigration  officer  to man each clearance  counter,  it\r\n\r\nalso enhances security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IACS is not a new system, as Mr Steve Chia seems\r\n\r\nto  suggest.  It was first implemented at Changi  Airport\r\n\r\nin   1997.    It  was  extended  to  Tuas  and  Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoints  in  1998  and  1999  respectively  for   bus\r\n\r\ntravellers.   The cost of implementing the  ICAS  is  $13\r\n\r\nmillion.    We   have  not  implemented  the   ICAS   for\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists  after a trial in 1999, because  the  total\r\n\r\nclearance   time   could   not   meet   our   operational\r\n\r\nrequirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, biometrics technology is a fast evolving field.\r\n\r\nInternational  research has shown that iris  recognition,\r\n\r\nwhich  works  by  scanning and matching  the  human  iris\r\n\r\npattern, has a very high level of accuracy and is  faster\r\n\r\ncompared to fingerprint matching.  Hence, SIR decided  to\r\n\r\nconduct  an  iris  recognition  trial  for  about   3,000\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists   on  a  voluntary  basis   at   the   land\r\n\r\ncheckpoints from June to December\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlast year to test the feasibility of implementing it on a\r\n\r\nfull scale for the motorcycle lanes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will not only reduce manpower, but more\r\n\r\nimportantly, it will also enhance the level  of  security\r\n\r\nwithout increasing the clearance time.  The trials at the\r\n\r\nWoodlands and Tuas Checkpoints cost about $300,000  each.\r\n\r\nSIR is now evaluating the results of the trial which seem\r\n\r\nto be quite encouraging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not the only country that is exploring\r\n\r\nthe  latest  biometrics technology to  enhance  security.\r\n\r\nUnder  the current security situation, countries such  as\r\n\r\nthe  United  States, Australia, Japan  are  also  on  the\r\n\r\nlookout for advanced biometrics technology for deployment\r\n\r\nat their checkpoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, why was there not\r\n\r\nmuch thought given to the IACS system when it was set up?\r\n\r\nIs it because the Ministry has been given too much money,\r\n\r\nso  they  spend  on this, and then later they  find  that\r\n\r\nanother system ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chia, just ask your question.

All  these systems change  all  the  time.\r\n\r\nWhen  we decided to do the IACS in 1997, we decided  that\r\n\r\nit  was a good system to be implemented in both the  land\r\n\r\nand  airport  checkpoints, and  it  served  our  purpose.\r\n\r\nThere is no waste of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question\r\n\r\n(28th February, 2003),\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament approves the financial policy of\r\n\r\nthe Government for the financial year 1st April, 2003  to\r\n\r\n31st March, 2004.\". - [Deputy Prime Minister and Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>11.26 am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  face formidable challenges in a world which  is\r\n\r\nchanging  rapidly and radically.  To me, the  thrust  and\r\n\r\nthe message of the Budget Statement and the ERC Report is\r\n\r\nclear.   To  succeed in this new increasingly competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment,  Singaporeans must be ready  for  a  mindset\r\n\r\nchange.  The Economic Review Committee has come out  with\r\n\r\nvarious recommendations, including some radical ones,  to\r\n\r\nensure that we are able to keep pace with the changes and\r\n\r\nmeet  the  challenges effectively.  As many Members  have\r\n\r\nemphasised,  it  is crucial that the recommendations  are\r\n\r\nimplemented  quickly  so  that  we  keep  ahead  of   our\r\n\r\ncompetitors.   It  will not be easy or painless,  but  we\r\n\r\ncannot  afford  to be soft.  There will be problem  areas\r\n\r\nthat   will  have  to  be  dealt  with  sensitively   and\r\n\r\ncarefully.  We will have to manage changes in a way  that\r\n\r\nmore  confidence will  be generated along the  way.   Our\r\n\r\ntrack  record  in managing changes in the past  has  been\r\n\r\nrecognised  by  many all over the world as exemplary  and\r\n\r\nthe  resources  that  we  have  pooled  over  the  years,\r\n\r\nespecially  our  financial and  human  resources,  should\r\n\r\nprovide  the  confidence  to  succeed  even  though   the\r\n\r\nchallenges  are  more serious than  what  we  have  faced\r\n\r\nbefore.   Social cohesion is critical and in the  process\r\n\r\nof  meeting  the  challenges, we  will  have  to  provide\r\n\r\nspecial  provisions for those who find it hard  to  cope,\r\n\r\nmainly  because of their education and age.   And  as  we\r\n\r\nmake  progress,  we  will have to ensure  that  everyone,\r\n\r\nregardless of race, language or religion, will be able to\r\n\r\nseize the opportunities that emerge, especially when they\r\n\r\nhave  made  the efforts to adapt and be relevant  to  the\r\n\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past two days, many valuable comments\r\n\r\nand  proposals were made by Members, particularly my  PAP\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  including the need to provide more  help  to\r\n\r\nthe  local businesses and SMEs, cutting red tape,  better\r\n\r\ninformation  sharing of retraining and upgrading  courses\r\n\r\navailable  for our workers, so that they are better  able\r\n\r\nto   consider  available  employment  opportunities.    I\r\n\r\nsupport these proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to turn to some specific issues.\r\n\r\nFirst,  employment  opportunities  for  older  or  mature\r\n\r\nworkers  who  have  voiced  their  concerns  about  their\r\n\r\nemployment difficulties.  They pointed out that employers\r\n\r\nprefer  younger  workers,  even  though  they  have  work\r\n\r\nexperience  and  the required skills and  qualifications.\r\n\r\nIt    is   frustrating   for   them   after   they   have\r\n\r\nconscientiously  attended retraining or skills  upgrading\r\n\r\ncourses to face barriers to employment, even though  they\r\n\r\nhave  realistic expectations of the job and  compensation\r\n\r\nterms.   With  the changes in the CPF contribution  rates\r\n\r\nfor older workers, especially those in the 50 to 55 years\r\n\r\nage  group,  their wages would have been  moderated.   We\r\n\r\nwill  have to urgently change employers' mindsets to  get\r\n\r\nthem  to give the older workers a fair opportunity to  be\r\n\r\nemployed.   In  the new work environment where  companies\r\n\r\nhave   to   constantly   restructure   to   boost   their\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,   workers  will   face   more   frequent\r\n\r\nemployment changes.  It will be very stressful for  older\r\n\r\nworkers  in  this new employment regime if the  employers\r\n\r\nonly   prefer  the  younger  workers.   It  is  therefore\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the  Government  to  address  this  issue\r\n\r\nurgently  and  to consider incentives to jolt  employers'\r\n\r\nmindsets to be fair in providing employment opportunities\r\n\r\nto  older  workers who have gone for skills and knowledge\r\n\r\nupgrading  to be relevant to the current demands  of  the\r\n\r\nworkplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next, complaints or allegations of\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory   hiring   practices.    Sir,   some   job\r\n\r\napplicants  have  provided feedback at my meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsessions  and  some have also written to the  press  that\r\n\r\nthey  are discriminated when they apply for a job.   They\r\n\r\ncan  understand  that there are jobs  which  may  require\r\n\r\nspecial requirements\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand,  if  they  do  not  meet the job  requirements,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  a  language ability or, more specifically,  the\r\n\r\nability  to speak Mandarin, or any other special  skills,\r\n\r\nthey  will not be considered for the job.  However,  they\r\n\r\nfeel   very   aggrieved  when  they  consider  themselves\r\n\r\nqualified  based  on  the  job  specifications,  but  not\r\n\r\nconsidered  for jobs for reasons which are not disclosed.\r\n\r\nThey simply cannot understand their rejections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such grievances should be urgently addressed.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  there will be a loss of trust and  confidence\r\n\r\nand our social cohesion will be severely tested.  At this\r\n\r\ntime of great uncertainty and increasing competition,  we\r\n\r\nmust  strengthen our unity and pull together to become  a\r\n\r\nformidable competitor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the sensitive issues of\r\n\r\nforeign  talents.   Some Singaporeans  have  also  voiced\r\n\r\ntheir  concerns of being displaced by foreign workers  or\r\n\r\ntalents.  The ERC Report has recognised that bringing  in\r\n\r\nforeign talent is a sensitive issue, especially so now in\r\n\r\na    slow   economy   with   retrenchments   and   rising\r\n\r\nunemployment.  However, we must be able to attract enough\r\n\r\nglobal  talents in order to be a dynamic and  competitive\r\n\r\neconomy.   There  is,  in fact, a great  competition  for\r\n\r\nglobal talents and it would be better for us to get  them\r\n\r\nin  our  workforce  than  in our competitors'  workforce.\r\n\r\nThey can certainly help create more job opportunities for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Having said this, I think more needs to be\r\n\r\ndone to explain to Singaporeans why it is vital for us to\r\n\r\nattract  foreign  or  global  talent  to  complement  our\r\n\r\nworkforce so that we are a world-class workforce able  to\r\n\r\nsustain  the  attraction of good quality  investments  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the development of an entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nculture  so that Singaporeans at all levels can  be  more\r\n\r\nenterprising and more self-reliant, I support  the  ERC's\r\n\r\nproposal to extend programmes to promote entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nto  the  young  people through the Community  Development\r\n\r\nCouncils.  Sir, allow me to share the experience at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe   South   East  CDC.   We  are  promoting   a   Young\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurs  Programme.   Last  year,  we  organised  a\r\n\r\nBreakthrough Camp for students to encourage them to break\r\n\r\nout  of  the  mould  and  to acquire  an  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nspirit.   During  the  camp,  the  students  were  taught\r\n\r\nbusiness skills emphasising creative as well as practical\r\n\r\naspects.   The students were challenged in a  very  short\r\n\r\ntime  to work a business proposal with limited resources,\r\n\r\nthat is, simulating the real world.  They presented their\r\n\r\nbusiness  ideas  to  a  panel  of  \"investors\"  and   the\r\n\r\nsuccessful  projects  went on  to  organise  a  Christmas\r\n\r\nBazaar  at  the Marine Parade Promenade.  Even the  teams\r\n\r\nthat  were  not  selected were  so  fired  up  that  they\r\n\r\norganised  themselves as a marketing team to promote  the\r\n\r\nBazaar.   They  made a profit of over $6,000  which  they\r\n\r\nunhesitantly donated to the Straits Times' School  Pocket\r\n\r\nFund showing that they were entrepreneurs with a heart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the process, we also created a community in\r\n\r\nsupport of entrepreneurs as parents, teachers and members\r\n\r\nof  the  Marine  Parade Merchants Association  came  out,\r\n\r\ndespite  a  heavy  downpour,  to  encourage  the  budding\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.  There is great interest among  the  young\r\n\r\nand  we will certainly continue with programmes with  the\r\n\r\naim of developing a strong, young entrepreneur network in\r\n\r\nthe South East District.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and Minister for Finance what will be the impact\r\n\r\nof  an increase in oil prices and a long, protracted  war\r\n\r\nin  Iraq on our economy.  Are we ready with a contingency\r\n\r\nplan in case of such an eventuality?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am confident that Singaporeans, our leaders,\r\n\r\nemployers, businessmen and workers have what it takes  to\r\n\r\nride  over  our current problems and build a more  robust\r\n\r\nand  competitive economy.  However, we have to watch  the\r\n\r\nexternal   environment   closely   and   understand   the\r\n\r\ndevelopments and trends.  We cannot afford to be soft and\r\n\r\nmust    proceed    quickly   to   implement    the    ERC\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  We have to cast aside the old  mindsets\r\n\r\nand  firmly  resolve to pull together  to  find  new  and\r\n\r\nbetter ways to earn a good living.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\njust  like  my colleagues and fellow Singaporeans,  I  am\r\n\r\nencouraged  by  the  Deputy Prime  Minister  and  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister,  Mr Lee Hsien Loong's bold vision  in  steering\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in this dull time into a safer environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the title of my speech is `Striking a Balance - Going Forward'. The Budget has many practical aspects to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our  Singaporeans'  resolve.   I   shall   be\r\n\r\nfocusing  on  four  aspects.  They are strengthening  the\r\n\r\nsocial  compact,  embracing a flexible future,  restoring\r\n\r\nCPF for the senior workforce and university graduates  in\r\n\r\nthe School of Straight Talk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on strengthening the social compact. The\r\n\r\ncrux  of  Budget  2003 is about remaking  the  individual\r\n\r\nspirit  and soul of Singaporeans as we embark on a future\r\n\r\nof  uncertainties.  Ever true to its political philosophy\r\n\r\nof  \"a  government of the people, for the people, by  the\r\n\r\npeople,\"   Budget  2003  promises  a  place   for   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  who  makes the effort in the  new  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  through the focused assistance of the Government\r\n\r\nand the support of the unions and employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focused assistance and support do not equate with\r\n\r\nfreebies   and  Singaporeans  must  begin  to  take   the\r\n\r\nincremental steps to self-reliance.  Logic dictates  that\r\n\r\npriorities   must   first  go  into   strengthening   the\r\n\r\nfundamentals and infrastructure for the New Economy.  The\r\n\r\nbig challenge ahead is how fast is the Government able to\r\n\r\nimplement  the many recommendations of the ERC which  are\r\n\r\nsupposed to revitalise the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions ahead of us include: are Singaporeans\r\n\r\nready for the wheel of change?  In doing so, how can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  strike a balance to ensure  that  we  do  not\r\n\r\nleave behind those older ones who are unable to catch up?\r\n\r\nOn  the  other hand, if we were to move too slowly,  then\r\n\r\nhow  can  we ensure that the needs of the younger  cohort\r\n\r\nwill be fulfilled?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not forget that there will always be in\r\n\r\nour midst those who are not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncapable of managing transition and also those who need to\r\n\r\nbe  given  the  booster  to get  themselves  going.   The\r\n\r\nspiritual  surgery  that Singaporeans are  going  through\r\n\r\nmust  be  supported by rich social capital where we  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  invest  the  time and efforts  to  explain  and\r\n\r\neducate the population on policy and directions taken  by\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People must feel that there is trust, respect and\r\n\r\ncompassion  in the society that they live  in.   This  is\r\n\r\nwhere the Government must be at the helm.  I have had the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of co-chairing one feedback session  on  the\r\n\r\nexpectations for Budget 2003 and also speaking to various\r\n\r\nstakeowners of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the newspaper reporting, I am happy to\r\n\r\nnote  that there was concern expressed for the needy poor\r\n\r\nwho  include  the middle income group whose  breadwinners\r\n\r\nhave  lost their jobs.  Brought up in a culture of  loans\r\n\r\nranging from loans for homes to cars, to household goods,\r\n\r\nto   credit  cards,  many  have  a  string  of  financial\r\n\r\ncommitments.   Yes, they can downgrade and sell off  even\r\n\r\nat  a loss.  The fact remains that they are out of a  job\r\n\r\nand  may  be  so  for a long time to come especially  for\r\n\r\nthose aged 40 and above.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there were calls for Government subsidies\r\n\r\nand  grants, these were dignified calls.  They were calls\r\n\r\nfor  targeted subsidies, grants and loans for  a  limited\r\n\r\nperiod  to  help the unemployed tide over their difficult\r\n\r\ntime.  I call these reasonable calls because we have,  in\r\n\r\nour  midst,  social  capital  that  has  self-regard  and\r\n\r\nempathy.   They  were not asking for freebies.   Here,  I\r\n\r\njoin  my  fellow MPs before me to urge the Government  to\r\n\r\nconsider a portion of the CPF account for the purpose  of\r\n\r\ngranting loans to those retrenched and who need  to  tide\r\n\r\nover their difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was saddened by what I saw when I went for my\r\n\r\nhouse  visit in the evening in Boon Lay.  The electricity\r\n\r\nof  two  households was cut off.  In one  household,  the\r\n\r\nchildren  were  seen  straining their  eyes  doing  their\r\n\r\nhomework in the dim candlelight.  In another household, a\r\n\r\nlittle  girl  was  reading under the  dim  light  of  the\r\n\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the retrenched middle-income group has never\r\n\r\nbeen   included  in  any  form  of  Government  financial\r\n\r\nassistance.   With an increasing cohort  of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfalling  into this group, it is timely that we give  them\r\n\r\nmore  attention.   Out of the 18,000  or  so  retrenched,\r\n\r\n7,000  comes  from  this cohort, and  this  is  no  small\r\n\r\nnumber.    In  the words of DPM Lee \"we  now  live  in  a\r\n\r\nfundamentally changed world\", it is therefore appropriate\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans should wear a new mindset.  Of course,\r\n\r\nwith  this come adjustments to realities around us  which\r\n\r\ninclude lowering our expectations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are a pragmatic lot and I trust that we\r\n\r\nhave  the  social capital and qualities to will ourselves\r\n\r\nto  do  what we need to do to survive.  Nonetheless,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must realise that there is a  social  compact\r\n\r\nwith  its people.  This social compact is to deliver jobs\r\n\r\nand  stability to the people of Singapore who, in return,\r\n\r\ngive the votes to the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unlike the employment relationship that a\r\n\r\ncorporation  has  with  its employees.   That  employment\r\n\r\nrelationship  is a commercial contract and therefore,  an\r\n\r\nenterprise  can within reasonable limits of the  contract\r\n\r\nterminate this commercial contract.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, social capital is not just focused on how we\r\n\r\nmight increase the wealth of an individual and a country.\r\n\r\nSocial  capital  is itself a form of wealth.   Sure,  our\r\n\r\nsocial  connections can help us in business but  feelings\r\n\r\nof   connection  and  commensurate  feelings  of  safety,\r\n\r\ncomfort  and  support constitute important  qualities  of\r\n\r\nlife.  As we look for competitive ways to be competitive,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  must  develop this social  compact  with\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in the midst of severe cost cutting and  job\r\n\r\nlosses  due  to retrenchment.  It is through building  up\r\n\r\nthis   social  capital  that  we  can  strengthen   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean's  resolve, and collectively forge  a  better\r\n\r\nand  flexible future.  Hence, the social compact  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  with its  people  must  strengthen\r\n\r\nduring these times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my second point on embracing a\r\n\r\nflexible future.  To embrace\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  flexible  future,  Singaporeans have  to  discard  old\r\n\r\npractices  and  habits,  even  practices  that  might  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  sacred  cows.   Hence,  both  employers   and\r\n\r\nemployees need to adopt a new mindset and better ways  of\r\n\r\ndoing  things.   This  includes flexi work  arrangements,\r\n\r\novertime  payments, flexi compensation and other overtime\r\n\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two main domains of the flexi future that we can\r\n\r\nconsider  are  the collective agreements and  flexi  work\r\n\r\nmindset.  On collective agreements, employers and  unions\r\n\r\nmay  even need to review the terms and conditions in  the\r\n\r\ncollective  agreements  so as to  help  employers  better\r\n\r\nmanage  the manpower cost structure, including  benefits.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, why should some collective agreements have\r\n\r\nfixed  increments and benefits, especially in a  volatile\r\n\r\nsituation,  where  we have to lower  costs  to  safeguard\r\n\r\njobs?  We may even need to shed `grandfather baggages' in\r\n\r\nthe  collective  agreements.  Why should such  collective\r\n\r\nagreements be signed for a duration of three  years?   In\r\n\r\nsuch volatile times, there may be a need for us to put in\r\n\r\nplace  flexi arrangements to review high cost  items  and\r\n\r\nirrelevant conditions which are deemed inappropriate in a\r\n\r\nchanged situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister has put it, there is no iron\r\n\r\nrice  bowl.   Today,  it  is about  disposable  styrofoam\r\n\r\nbowls.  In driving productivity and cost competitiveness,\r\n\r\nearly retirement and layoffs are just some of the options\r\n\r\nopen  to  companies.  Very often, the hidden  costs  come\r\n\r\nfrom `grandfather rights' in the form of shift and roster\r\n\r\npatterns  and  entrenched compensation  and  benefits  in\r\n\r\ncollective  agreements.  One may argue, \"Well, collective\r\n\r\nagreements are negotiable documents.  Go and bargain  for\r\n\r\nthe best deal.\"  But we know that negotiations tidying up\r\n\r\nwastages   arising  from  fixated  items  in   collective\r\n\r\nagreements   can  be  protracted.   Therefore,   a   more\r\n\r\nconvenient and expeditious way taken by most companies is\r\n\r\nto  retrench  or  offer  early  retirement.   It  enables\r\n\r\ncompanies to turn around bottomline results quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In new economy thinking, clean wage ensures cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness for business\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand   saves   jobs.   Renewal  of  collective  agreements\r\n\r\ntraditionally cost companies anything from 3-5%  increase\r\n\r\nto  the  payroll.  Moreover, they can tie companies  down\r\n\r\nfor  a  good three years.  Perhaps it is time to  rethink\r\n\r\nthe  structure and purpose of a collective  agreement  in\r\n\r\nthe  new economy, just as the unions themselves have been\r\n\r\nevolving their role to be more relevant.  So, instead  of\r\n\r\njust massive layoffs or early retirement, perhaps we  can\r\n\r\nsubstitute  with  smaller-scale  layoffs  and  trim   the\r\n\r\n`grandfather baggage' in the collective agreements.  They\r\n\r\ncan  achieve  similar outcomes.  In  fact,  they  can  be\r\n\r\nneater.   Newcomers  to the company  simply  inherit  the\r\n\r\n`grandfather rights.'  So what happens is that whilst  we\r\n\r\nweed off employees at one end, the other end continues to\r\n\r\ngrow  into  the rigidity of the system.  Cost, therefore,\r\n\r\ncontinues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are facing a very uncertain future,\r\n\r\nwith a number of factors converging at the same time: the\r\n\r\nworst  economic  downturn since independence,  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment,  highest unemployment rate, poor  fertility\r\n\r\nrates,  threats of terrorists acts, and the looming  Iraq\r\n\r\nwar.   Against  this  background,  Singaporeans  need  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen their resilience to overcome these challenges.\r\n\r\nWe  can  do  this  by  adopting a  flexi  and  pro-active\r\n\r\nmindset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It used to be challenges that we had to contend\r\n\r\nwith.   Today,  and  in  the  future,  we  have  to  face\r\n\r\nuncertainties.  While challenges spur us  on  with  hope,\r\n\r\nuncertainties  underscore an unpredictable future,  which\r\n\r\ncan turn hope into despondency.  Here, the Government and\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders must step in to raise the  confidence\r\n\r\nof Singaporeans and encourage them to plough on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second domain is on flexi mindset. We will\r\n\r\nbegin  to  see  a  workforce made up of economic  gypsies\r\n\r\nsimply  because  they  have turned itinerant,  so  as  to\r\n\r\nadjust   to  an  increasingly  complex  and  inconsistent\r\n\r\nbusiness environment.  Singaporeans must recognise that a\r\n\r\nflexi  arrangement is an important source of  competitive\r\n\r\nadvantage   for   companies.   Two  noteworthy   benefits\r\n\r\nobserved by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies   with   flexi   arrangements   are    enhanced\r\n\r\nproductivity  and  being  nimble  in  different  business\r\n\r\nenvironments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of employment relations, we see new\r\n\r\ntrends   emerging.   Companies  are  beginning  to   hire\r\n\r\ntemporary  part-time  or contract workers.   Today,  some\r\n\r\n37,000  people in Singapore are classified as  `temporary\r\n\r\nor  part-time  employees'.  This may be  a  small  number\r\n\r\ncompared  to many other countries, but it is a  50%  jump\r\n\r\nfrom  the  number recorded in 1998.  In today's difficult\r\n\r\ntimes, a temporary job is always better than no job  but,\r\n\r\nclearly,  there  are many issues to be  considered.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  companies  may  have  to  specially  invest  in\r\n\r\ntraining  for their short-term or part-time employees  so\r\n\r\nas  to  raise  their  productivity.   Furthermore,  while\r\n\r\nemployees may be denied a coherent career structure, they\r\n\r\nare  flexible,  as  they can move on to  other  companies\r\n\r\nrequiring their services.  Companies will be able to stay\r\n\r\ncompetitive with a flexible workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge Singaporeans to adopt a flexible mindset with\r\n\r\nregard  to  employment.  Many of the jobs that have  gone\r\n\r\nmay  never  come back.  Flexibility is a way of  widening\r\n\r\nthe  potential labour market.  In addition to  short-term\r\n\r\nor  part-time working, flexible work arrangements come in\r\n\r\nother  forms.  They can include job sharing, tele-working\r\n\r\nor working from home, besides contract work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sub-Committee of the ERC on Enhancing Human\r\n\r\nCapital has, in its recommendations, highlighted the need\r\n\r\nto  grant  companies  the discretion  to  implement  work\r\n\r\nschedules that are based on their actual strategic needs.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, organisations should be  given  greater\r\n\r\nfreedom to implement flexible working practices, so as to\r\n\r\nbetter optimise their manpower resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the success of a flexible future hinges on\r\n\r\nimplementing  a  framework  or  guidelines   to   prevent\r\n\r\nmalpractices,  as  well as engaging  the  HR  fraternity.\r\n\r\nThere  was  also a recommendation to review  the  present\r\n\r\nemployment   legislation,   which   often   limits    the\r\n\r\nimplementation of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nflexi   work  arrangements.   As  the  Sub-Committee   on\r\n\r\nEnhancing  Human Capital has rightly noted, a  flexi-work\r\n\r\narrangement  can only succeed if employers and  employees\r\n\r\nare  prepared to adapt to new practices.  To ensure  that\r\n\r\nmalpractices do not take place, the Ministry of Manpower,\r\n\r\ntogether  with the unions, employers and professional  HR\r\n\r\nbodies,   should  put  in  place  broad  guidelines   for\r\n\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry also highlighted the challenges posed\r\n\r\nas a consequence of `contingency workers'.  Non-permanent\r\n\r\nworkers,  for example, are not automatically entitled  to\r\n\r\nemployee   benefits,  such  as  medical   and   insurance\r\n\r\nentitlements.  One option currently under review  is  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of medical benefits that are pegged  to  the\r\n\r\nnumber of hours worked in a month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this point, I would like to declare that I\r\n\r\nam  a  HR practitioner as well as the President of  SHRI,\r\n\r\nand  what  I am about to speak reflects the views  of  my\r\n\r\nprofession and Institute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are three areas that the HR fraternity\r\n\r\nwould  like  to offer its services to promote a  flexible\r\n\r\nculture  in  our  industry. They are joint  participation\r\n\r\nwith the Tripartite Body, SBF as well as the newly set up\r\n\r\nCET statutory board and the CAL.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues arising from implementing flexi\r\n\r\ncollective  agreements and work mindset will need  to  be\r\n\r\naddressed by the HR experts and practitioners from the HR\r\n\r\nfraternity.  These credible professionals have  years  of\r\n\r\npractical   experience  and  insights  into   issues   of\r\n\r\norganisation  and  employment.  No  substitute  can  just\r\n\r\nspring  out of the blue to resolve these issues.   I  say\r\n\r\nthis  because - although I am the Co-Chairperson  of  the\r\n\r\nSub-Committee on Enhancing Human Capital - I only came to\r\n\r\nknow that SBF and SPRING Singapore are poised to forge HR\r\n\r\nexcellence  and  competencies when I  saw  the  print  in\r\n\r\nchapters  12  and  13  of the ERC  report.   On  national\r\n\r\nprogrammes such as these, it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimportant that the HR fraternity play a key role as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is heartening to note and hear from many\r\n\r\nquarters, including our highest political leadership,  on\r\n\r\r\nthe  importance of human capital.  As co-players, the  HR\r\n\r\nfraternity  sees  itself  as  a  plus  component  in  the\r\n\r\ntripartite formula.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been re-making itself in every sphere\r\n\r\nin  the  last two years.  Why not re-make the  Tripartite\r\n\r\nBody  into  a Tripartite-Plus that will then see  a  more\r\n\r\nvisible  impact  of  the professionals  in  the  decision\r\n\r\nmaking  of  the Tripartite Body?  I am glad that  the  HR\r\n\r\nfraternity  in  the  private sector, represented  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower  as well and  by  SHRI,  has  been\r\n\r\nactively  promoting  and  showcasing  HR  excellence  and\r\n\r\npractices  through a community of learning  and  sharing,\r\n\r\nboth locally and overseas.  As mentioned, the SBF will be\r\n\r\nsetting  up  a  HR  Centre  of  Excellence  to  drive  HR\r\n\r\npractices and excellence in the private sector.   The  HR\r\n\r\nfraternity   sees   itself  synergising   its   practical\r\n\r\nexperience  and  practices with  the  Centre.   I  see  a\r\n\r\ntwinning  of  the 38-year-old SHRI with  the  newborn  HR\r\n\r\nCentre of Excellence of the SBF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embracing a flexible future is to remain relevant\r\n\r\nwith   the   skills  and  knowledge  that  will   empower\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to stay employable, as well as to assume any\r\n\r\nform  of self-employment activities.  This entails  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean to acquire multi-skills and lifelong learning\r\n\r\ncapabilities.  This is their only form of safety  net  to\r\n\r\nendure    uncertainties   in   the   environment.     The\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  a  national Continuing  Education  and\r\n\r\nTraining  (CET)  body  and a Centre  for  Adult  Learning\r\n\r\n(CAL),  together with the setting up of portable training\r\n\r\naccounts  for  our workforce, will ensure that  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas the future workforce that is relevant to the needs of\r\n\r\nthe   industry.    The  ERC  recommendations   to   equip\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  for the future and to help Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nface  up  to  the challenges are concrete steps  to  this\r\n\r\nflexible future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on restoring CPF for the senior workforce, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, in his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBudget speech, announced that the restoration of the  CPF\r\n\r\nrate  to 20% will not take place over the next two years.\r\n\r\nInstead,  the current 16% rate of employer's contribution\r\n\r\nwill be retained over the next two years.  The purport of\r\n\r\nthis measure is to ensure that wage costs do not get  out\r\n\r\nof  line  with  the urgent priority of helping  Singapore\r\n\r\nrecover  from this recession.  Since wage costs represent\r\n\r\na  significant  part of total costs in  Singapore  today,\r\n\r\nthis  move  is  indeed  a signal to investors  that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  is serious about tackling the issue  of  cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, there are a number of concerns that I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to raise with respect to the  issue  of  not\r\n\r\nrestoring  the 20% employer contribution rate  for  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  50 and above, even when this recession is  well\r\n\r\nbehind  us. The main concern behind this policy  is  that\r\n\r\nolder  Singaporeans are able to find jobs in the  future.\r\n\r\nMost  of the concerns centre around the observation  that\r\n\r\nemployers  perceive older workers to be more costly  than\r\n\r\ntheir younger counterparts, and less productive as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a number of my colleagues have said so before, I\r\n\r\nthink the Government would have a better time selling its\r\n\r\ncase if it can back up the assumptions with solid data to\r\n\r\nshow that older workers do not represent value for money,\r\n\r\nwhen  compared to their younger counterparts.   Is  there\r\n\r\ndata  evidence  to  show  that  older  workers  are  less\r\n\r\nproductive and would cost more in terms of the  value-add\r\n\r\nthey  bring  to the job, as compared to younger  workers?\r\n\r\nAre   there   real,  concrete  bits  of  information   to\r\n\r\nconclusively  demonstrate that the policy of  maintaining\r\n\r\nthe   employer's  CPF  contribution  rate  at  16%  would\r\n\r\nsignificantly reduce the overall costs of doing  business\r\n\r\nin Singapore and, therefore, increasing the employability\r\n\r\nof older workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent experience that this group of people\r\n\r\ncould  not  gain  re-employment after losing  their  jobs\r\n\r\nsuggests  that the problem of employability may have  its\r\n\r\ncause elsewhere.  If such is the case, then the policy of\r\n\r\nnot restoring the employer's contribution to 20% for this\r\n\r\ngroup of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers would be a double whammy blow for them.  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  it  would be much more prudent to educate employers\r\n\r\nto  change  their  perceptions concerning  older  workers\r\n\r\nrather  than  adopt  a  measure  that  may  not  be  very\r\n\r\neffective to begin with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially so when we think about the\r\n\r\ndifficulties many among this group of workers would  face\r\n\r\nin  ensuring  that they have sufficient funds  for  their\r\n\r\nretirement and not have to depend on the state for  their\r\n\r\nupkeep.  While it is laudable to attempt to maintain  the\r\n\r\nemployability  of  this  group of  workers,  it  is  also\r\n\r\nimportant  that we keep other objectives in  mind  before\r\n\r\nimplementing  the policy.  This is especially  so  if  we\r\n\r\nwish  to  ensure that many older workers  do  not  suffer\r\n\r\nundue hardship in the years to come.  Sir, I also join my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in  advocating for  a  mindset  programme  or\r\n\r\ncampaign  for  employers  with regard  to  employing  the\r\n\r\nsenior workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth aspect is providing the university\r\n\r\ngraduates  a transit in the School of Straight  Talk.   I\r\n\r\nwould   like  to  urge  those  graduates  who  are  still\r\n\r\nunemployed to take an active lifestyle during  this  time\r\n\r\nby  tapping  the services available at self-help  groups,\r\n\r\nCDCs and SPEC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPEC is termed the `School of Straight Talk' because\r\n\r\nit  runs  practical programmes that equip the  retrenched\r\n\r\nparticipants  with  realities of a downturn,  values  and\r\n\r\nskills  and assist them with job placements.   Such  pre-employment orientation talk in an unemployment  situation\r\n\r\ncan  be  useful.   Bottom-line driven  organisations  are\r\n\r\nshunning university graduates for diploma holders and ITE\r\n\r\ngraduands   because  these  are  supposed  to   be   less\r\n\r\ndemanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In actual fact, many bottom-line driven\r\n\r\norganisations are taking this opportunity to recast  jobs\r\n\r\ntraditionally  held  by the `O' and `A'  levels  holders.\r\n\r\nMany  of  these jobs are now redesigned and enlarged  for\r\n\r\nthe diploma holders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the potential of the university\r\n\r\ngraduates lies in their ability to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontribute  at  a  higher strategic  level.   There  will\r\n\r\nalways be a need in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, if university graduates are prepared to\r\n\r\nstart  from  the  lowest end and win over  the  potential\r\n\r\nemployer  with  a  willing attitude,  they  can  have  an\r\n\r\nadvantage in terms of their strategic contribution to the\r\n\r\ncompany in the long run.  It can be very discouraging  to\r\n\r\nbe faced with a bleak job prospect and, at the same time,\r\n\r\nbeing told that their failure to find a job is because of\r\n\r\ntheir unrealistic expectations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over FM 93.8 radio, graduates were interviewed on\r\n\r\ntheir  feelings  about  the  job  market  and  many  have\r\n\r\nexpressed despondency over the bleak job prospect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned that if this matter is not given\r\n\r\nthe attention, the morale of our university graduates and\r\n\r\ntheir resolve to find a job would be affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Straight Talk runs programmes on\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurship, Self-Employment and Minding the Mind in\r\n\r\ndifficult  times.  Such programmes will  help  boost  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of our graduates, inculcate a flexible mindset\r\n\r\nand equip them with practical skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to extend some financial\r\n\r\nassistance under the WSTP funding for retrenched  workers\r\n\r\nto  this  group of graduates as well.  In this way,  they\r\n\r\ncan  prepare themselves better for the job that they  are\r\n\r\nlooking  for.   And  so, university  graduates  need  not\r\n\r\ndespair whilst waiting for that job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to raise that in\r\n\r\nour  pursuit for unprecedented structural change, we must\r\n\r\nbe  mindful  that our transactions and relationship  with\r\n\r\npeople  do  not evolve into an adversarial stance,  where\r\n\r\neach hardens its resolve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do not need more are the quick fixes to\r\n\r\nproblems within the rules in the box.  Instead,  we  need\r\n\r\nstrong  social  capital  support for  the  stark  choices\r\n\r\narising from thinking out of the box.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As people grapple in the dark to find new ways, they\r\n\r\nwant  and need help.  Such help must be based on respect,\r\n\r\ntrust  and  advocacy of interests within the  context  of\r\n\r\nevolving new lives for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Budget 2003 will spur the implementation of the\r\n\r\nERC   recommendations  and  the  success  lies   in   the\r\n\r\nacceptance  of a flexi future by the public, private  and\r\n\r\npeople  sectors of Singapore.  Only then can the  economy\r\n\r\nremain competitive for years to come.\r\n\r\n<br>12.07 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI   would  like  to  focus  on  two  groups,  the   older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and young Singaporeans: what do they have to\r\n\r\nlook forward to?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, older Singaporeans. In this debate, much has\r\n\r\nbeen   said  about  the  problems  posed  by  our   aging\r\n\r\nworkforce,  such  as  increased social  spending  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  The  answer to this problem, as  stated  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget Statement, is:  we must find new sources of growth\r\n\r\nor  else  stagnate and decline.  Put this way, the  aging\r\n\r\npopulation is cast as a burden on society and  the  cause\r\n\r\nof  possible stagnation.  Why not view them instead as  a\r\n\r\npotential  engine  for  economic  growth?   The   greying\r\n\r\npopulation can be a big opportunity for business and  can\r\n\r\nspur the Silver Sector, the industry for senior citizens.\r\n\r\nThis would involve not only medical and nursing care, but\r\n\r\nalso  creating,  producing  and  marketing  products  and\r\n\r\nservices  to  meet  their changing needs  and  interests.\r\n\r\nThis  would  include  anti-aging  healthcare  and  beauty\r\n\r\nproducts,  health  supplements like Viagra,  cheaper  and\r\n\r\nbetter   alternatives  to  that,  as  well   as   leisure\r\n\r\nactivities.  The Silver Sector may also boost the pension\r\n\r\nand insurance industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just look at the phenomenon of line dancing which\r\n\r\ntook  our older Singaporeans by storm.  Imagine how  much\r\n\r\nmoney  some  entrepreneurs made by selling cowboy  boots,\r\n\r\ncowboy  hats and chequered shirts.  Mind you,  these  are\r\n\r\nnot  cheap stuff.   As I understand it, the cowboy  boots\r\n\r\nare brought in from Australia and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey  cost from $100 to $1,000 a pair and they are  being\r\n\r\nsnapped  up by our not-so-young residents and  during  an\r\n\r\neconomic downturn.  Sir, we should not keep painting  all\r\n\r\nolder  Singaporeans as people without spending power  and\r\n\r\nwho would only drain our resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 10 years, we will have more empty nesters\r\n\r\nthan  young people.  Empty nesters are those aged  40  to\r\n\r\n59,  with  their youngest nearing financial independence.\r\n\r\nWe  will  also  have more aging singles with considerable\r\n\r\npurchasing  power.   The  number  of  empty  nesters   is\r\n\r\nforecast  to grow by 50% to 10.9 million during the  next\r\n\r\ndecade  in  economies  like Hong Kong,  Singapore,  South\r\n\r\nKorea and Taiwan. At the same time, the youth market will\r\n\r\nshrink  by  10% during the same decade.  In  Japan,  some\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  already reorienting  their  marketing  to\r\n\r\nappeal  to the senior citizens.  As the Asian Wall Street\r\n\r\nJournal  reported on February 28th, Yamaha Corp  had  two\r\n\r\nyears  ago created an easy to play electronic guitar  for\r\n\r\nolder people who grew up on the Beatles and Japanese folk\r\n\r\nrock  and  who had always wanted to play the  guitar.  So\r\n\r\nthey produced an easier version of the electronic guitar.\r\n\r\nThe  guitar was a hit with those above 50 and  they  were\r\n\r\nall snapped up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another reason why the Government should\r\n\r\nnurture  the  Silver  Sector as one  of  our  new  growth\r\n\r\nindustries.   It  would  also help  with  the  employment\r\n\r\nsituation  of  our  older  workers.  Studies   in   other\r\n\r\ncountries show that companies with customers aged over 45\r\n\r\nare   more  likely  to  employ  a  mature  worker.  These\r\n\r\ncompanies  know  that  if they are to  appeal  to  mature\r\n\r\ncustomers, they need to improve the level of service they\r\n\r\noffer this group.  Older workers will become increasingly\r\n\r\nimportant in developing relationships with customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our growing population would also influence\r\n\r\nemployment  trends.   In Australia,  the  second  biggest\r\n\r\nemployer group was hospitals and nursing homes with about\r\n\r\n330,000 workers.  As its population gets older and begins\r\n\r\nto   require  even  more  medical  attention,  employment\r\n\r\ncategories such as medical and dental services are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexpected to continue to grow.  This means more jobs would\r\n\r\nbe created in these sectors. Are we projecting for this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of our older workers today feel that their\r\n\r\nfuture  in Singapore looks like a bleak one because  what\r\n\r\nthey hear and see is this: their pay needs to be cut year\r\n\r\nafter  year  by the CPF to make them more employable  and\r\n\r\nthen  jobs  are still hard to come by even with  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncuts.   Cost  will keep rising as public services  become\r\n\r\nmore  market-oriented.  Medical and social services  will\r\n\r\nbe  means-tested.   They are a burden  to  society.   The\r\n\r\nemphasis is on nurturing the young, and not the old.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to get through to them a better vision\r\n\r\nof  their  future - or else why should they buy into  it?\r\n\r\nThat  is  why  one of the brightest spots in this  year's\r\n\r\nBudget  to me is the setting up of a new statutory  board\r\n\r\nfor  Continuing Education and Training.  It should tailor\r\n\r\nprogrammes specifically for our mature workers which  can\r\n\r\nthen place them into decent jobs.  If the pay is too  low\r\n\r\nwith  reduced  CPF  and  the job is  too  onerous,  older\r\n\r\nworkers  may not see it as worth their while to carry  on\r\n\r\nworking.   One way to encourage them to continue  working\r\n\r\nis to provide financial incentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under one proposal in Australia, people who\r\n\r\nwork for five years beyond their pension age could become\r\n\r\neligible  for  a tax-free payment of A$25,000  when  they\r\n\r\nretire.   We need not be so generous.  But the option  to\r\n\r\nme seems stark - unemployed and pessimistic older workers\r\n\r\nclamouring  for  more  handouts and  subsidies  or  older\r\n\r\nworkers with decent jobs which make them feel useful  and\r\n\r\nwanted,  and a decent quality of life to make  them  glad\r\n\r\nthat they are Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to young Singaporeans, Sir, their mood today\r\n\r\nis one of frustration and despondency.  Many of our fresh\r\n\r\ngraduates  have found it hard to get the jobs they  want.\r\n\r\nBut  it is useful to remember that this is not the  first\r\n\r\ntime  that  we  have been through such a difficult  time.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when I graduated in 1986, it was a recession year\r\n\r\nand I too found it hard to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfind  a  job. After my final examinations, jobs  were  so\r\n\r\nscarce  that  I  had  to  take a part-time  job,  telling\r\n\r\nchildren stories at the Robinson's toy department.  I was\r\n\r\nhired  by a young entrepreneur who was bringing in  teddy\r\n\r\nbears  from  Australia, and for each bear,  there  was  a\r\n\r\ncharacter in the story.  So I gained from the efforts  of\r\n\r\na  young entrepreneur.  My pay was $100 a week as my  job\r\n\r\nwas  only over the weekends in the afternoons in the  toy\r\n\r\ndepartment.  That was about $400 a month.  But the  money\r\n\r\nmanaged to tide me over for about two months until I  got\r\n\r\na  full-time  job at $800 a month. So that was  double  - what joy!  And that was as an editor-cum-writer-cum-sales-cum-marketing  person-cum-ad-copywriter-cum  many   other\r\n\r\nsmall jobs for a small time publication company.  It  was\r\n\r\nan  insecure  job  because  the company's  finances  were\r\n\r\nshaky.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite the poor prospects, I thought having a\r\n\r\njob was much better than having none.  And frankly, I had\r\n\r\na  great time because I felt stretched and I also  learnt\r\n\r\nto stretch the dollar.  And one of the greatest pleasures\r\n\r\nfor  me  in  those  days was to save up  enough  to  have\r\n\r\nbreakfast at McDonald's.  But about five months later  in\r\n\r\nAugust  1986, I got a job in the Straits Times which  was\r\n\r\nthe start of a more stable career until I joined politics\r\n\r\nin 2001.  I tell this story to remind ourselves that this\r\n\r\ngloomy   situation  for  our  young  graduates  is   only\r\n\r\ntemporary.   The  crucial thing I learn is  to  keep  our\r\n\r\nchins up and to seize every opportunity that comes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see this tough time as an opportunity for our\r\n\r\nyoung  Singaporeans  to  show  their  mettle.   The  more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  among us should strike  out  and  follow\r\n\r\ntheir  passion. What is the worst that could happen?   We\r\n\r\nfail,  so  what?  Try again, better than staring  at  the\r\n\r\nwall  and  griping.  And with the Minister  of  State  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of entrepreneurship, the outlook should  be  more\r\n\r\npromising now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more creative among us should write plays,\r\n\r\npoems,  songs, make movies that can give us  a  different\r\n\r\nview of things\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand,  in  the process, help lift us from this gloom.   In\r\n\r\nthis  respect,  I am pleased that the Government  is  not\r\n\r\nstinging on its investment in the arts scene.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure how many of you remember but there is\r\n\r\nthis  song  titled \"Happy Days are Here Again\".   It  was\r\n\r\nwritten  in  1929  in the US for a movie called  \"Chasing\r\n\r\nRainbows\" and the chorus goes:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy days are here again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skies above are clear again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let us sing a song of cheer again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy days are here again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this song was written and sung in the midst of\r\n\r\nthe  Great Depression in the US.  Yet the lyrics are  one\r\n\r\nof  hope  and  cheer.   You  have  to  hear  the  Barbara\r\n\r\nStreisand version to hear how exhilarating the  song  can\r\n\r\nbe.   What  we are going through is by no means  a  great\r\n\r\ndepression, but where we are heading towards is indeed  a\r\n\r\ngreat destination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget is a step towards realising the vision of\r\n\r\na  leading  global city, a hub of talent, enterprise  and\r\n\r\ninnovation and one of the best places to work and live in\r\n\r\nAsia.   It is a place where, young or old, all of us  can\r\n\r\nenjoy  an  interesting  and  fulfilling  life.   This  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  we  should  look  forward  to  and  work\r\n\r\ntowards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, we have many strengths, not\r\n\r\nleast  a  team of good leaders who have brought  us  this\r\n\r\nfar.   It  must  be  recalled that, though  some  of  the\r\n\r\nchanges in recent years have been swift and drastic, such\r\n\r\nshifts are not new in Singapore.  The 1960s, in fact, had\r\n\r\nbeen  the  most  revolutionary for Singapore.  Few  other\r\n\r\ncountries  have undergone so many significant changes  in\r\n\r\nso  short  a  period.  The 1960s saw  the  transition  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  from  a colony to an internally self-governing\r\n\r\nstate  from  1959  to 1963, to becoming  a  part  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965, and then to  an\r\n\r\nindependent  republic. Furthermore, the  challenges  that\r\n\r\nthreaten  Singapore's economic viability as a  state  was\r\n\r\nsprung\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  it  in  quick  succession.  This  includes  Sukarno's\r\n\r\nConfrontation  and  Britain's decision  to  withdraw  its\r\n\r\nmilitary bases in 1975 which left Singapore with the task\r\n\r\nof  absorbing 40,000 employees, making up for the loss of\r\n\r\n20%  of  the  GNP and creating a credible  defence  force\r\n\r\nwithin   four  years.   It  was  Singapore's  leadership,\r\n\r\ntogether with the support of the people, that effectively\r\n\r\novercame all these severe problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1986, when I was wondering what the future\r\n\r\nheld,  there was a team looking at how to pull  Singapore\r\n\r\nout  of  the  recession.   It  was  called  the  Economic\r\n\r\nCommittee  and  was  led  by Mr  Lee  Hsien  Loong,  then\r\n\r\nMinister of State for Trade and Industry.  Today we  have\r\n\r\nanother  committee,  the Economic Review  Committee,  led\r\n\r\nalso  by Mr Lee.  Sir, I would say that our leaders  have\r\n\r\nhad  a  good track record so far.  This should  give  our\r\n\r\npeople  confidence.  I, for one, am confident that,  with\r\n\r\nthe  people  united behind the Government, determined  to\r\n\r\nachieve  a  better Singapore, happy days would indeed  be\r\n\r\nhere again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  just  want to speak in support of this motion  in  the\r\n\r\nname  of the Minister for Finance.  Members of the  House\r\n\r\nhave  been  speaking and have spoken  at  length  on  the\r\n\r\nvarious issues in the Economic Review Committee Report on\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship and the present economic difficulties we\r\n\r\nare   facing.   I  want  to  focus  specifically  on  the\r\n\r\ninvestment issues and business related issues to growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the foreign direct investment issue. Our\r\n\r\neconomic strategy over the past three decades or more has\r\n\r\nbeen on attracting foreign investments that will lead  to\r\n\r\ngrowth  and employment.  We had been very fortunate.   We\r\n\r\nembarked on this path in the sixties, just about the time\r\n\r\nwhen the MNCs were going transnational.  We betted on the\r\n\r\nMNCs  and the export growth strategy and that would  help\r\n\r\nus  clear  our unemployment problem then and  our  growth\r\n\r\ninto the future.  We were right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, however, the other giants have awakened,\r\n\r\nchiefly India and China.  And, today we all know China is\r\n\r\nabsorbing the major share of the FDIs from the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This foreign direct investment (FDI) growth strategy\r\n\r\nhere is characterised by a lumpy or plant size investment\r\n\r\nin  manufacturing products, which can be a  final  or  an\r\n\r\nintermediate produce, which is usually exported overseas.\r\n\r\nThe  gain  we  expect from the manufacturing  process  is\r\n\r\nderived from the employment generated and the value-added\r\n\r\nfor the investors.  Is this FDI growth strategy still the\r\n\r\nway to go for Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying the foreign investment is no more\r\n\r\nuseful.   It  is  a source of technology  and  jobs.   My\r\n\r\nquestion is: can FDI growth be an effective strategy  for\r\n\r\nus, whether it is in the current electronics industry  or\r\n\r\nsome other manufacturing sector?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should remember that when we went into the FDI\r\n\r\ngrowth  strategy many years back, many of  our  competing\r\n\r\ncountries were not awakened yet.  Later, as more of  them\r\n\r\nwere  awakened to the challenges, the EDB had to  attract\r\n\r\nso-called  higher  technology content and  higher  value-added  industries  to  base them  here.   The  employment\r\n\r\ncreation  in  many of these investments is low,  and  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness in terms of business cost or wage cost is\r\n\r\nonly  temporary as the technology of these  processes  is\r\n\r\noften embodied in the machines.  As the costs get higher,\r\n\r\nthese factories move in search for lower wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we should be aiming at in growth at this stage\r\n\r\nof  our  economic  development is to move  to  businesses\r\n\r\nwhere the technology or knowledge resides in the heads of\r\n\r\nour people, not just in the machines.  With technology in\r\n\r\nmachines,  labour ends up working for the  machines.   We\r\n\r\nalways think that the machine is working for us.  Capital\r\n\r\ngets  higher rate of return and labour gets paid  in  low\r\n\r\nwage.  With technology or knowledge invested in the head,\r\n\r\nthe  table  is  turned, and the knowledge and  technology\r\n\r\nworkers get more decision-making and get the first\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncut  of  the  value-added.   So  we  have  to  reposition\r\n\r\nourselves and the investment we attract.  I believe  this\r\n\r\nknowledge  based  in  the  head investment  approach  for\r\n\r\ngrowth rather than machines or plants is more sustainable\r\n\r\nfor us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These investments in knowledge and technology in our\r\n\r\nheads  can  also  be  lost if our able  men  go  away  or\r\n\r\nmigrate.  I assume it is harder to move the men than  the\r\n\r\nmachines.  But that is another issue.  The investments in\r\n\r\nthe  heads have to have quality and content.  It  has  to\r\n\r\nhave  complementary resources to get the correct  soup  - good  brains  and environment and research facilities  in\r\n\r\nuniversities or private research units.  There  also  has\r\n\r\nto  be  quality.  For example, some years ago we  started\r\n\r\nthis  idea  of  \"incubators\" for research and  design  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The best example of incubators is, of course,\r\n\r\nSilicon  Valley.  But recently we hear of  incubators  by\r\n\r\nthe hundreds all over China.  Is this the real thing?   I\r\n\r\nam  not sure.  Some young talented research students  may\r\n\r\nbe there, but the facilities for research, the resources,\r\n\r\nthe   marketing  and  business  network  connection,  the\r\n\r\ninternational trust and respect for Intellectual Property\r\n\r\nRights,  the  efficient legal infrastructure system,  are\r\n\r\nnot there in China, or even in India, by a long mile.  So\r\n\r\nthese  are actually competitive advantages for Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhich we should exploit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If input investment under FDI for growth is not\r\n\r\nsustainable,  what then should the new Singapore  economy\r\n\r\nbe  aiming  for?   We should be aiming  for  growth  from\r\n\r\nResearch  and Development, Design, Innovation,  Knowledge\r\n\r\nand  Quality Control.  These are growth factors  but,  by\r\n\r\nthemselves, spending on them may not yield returns.   The\r\n\r\nproductivity of these factors will also be determined  by\r\n\r\nhow  well our businesses in the economy can synergise and\r\n\r\nhow  well we can blend these elements and market them for\r\n\r\nbusiness.   Here  is  where the assistance  to  SMEs  and\r\n\r\noutsourced   businesses  can  be  developed  to   service\r\n\r\ntechnical processes.  This type of growth in the  economy\r\n\r\nis  different  from  the input growth  we  have  been  so\r\n\r\nfamiliar\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith.   Economists call this endogenous growth  and  such\r\n\r\ngrowth derives from total factor productivity gain.  I am\r\n\r\nglad  SPRING has last year finally embarked on  measuring\r\n\r\ntotal  factor productivity in our economy.  It will  take\r\n\r\ntime  to  systematically  monitor  this,  but  it  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant step in the right direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask our workers to brace for the challenges - tighten up for the competition by lowering wage\r\n\r\nexpectations,  CPF  and so on.  What  can  our  GLCs  and\r\n\r\nbigger Singaporean companies do?  Can the Government  get\r\n\r\nGLCs to spearhead this overseas business drive by setting\r\n\r\nthe  management to work and achieve X% of  their  revenue\r\n\r\nfrom  overseas  by year Y by developing  viable  overseas\r\n\r\nbusinesses?  By setting targets and time-lines for  them?\r\n\r\nAny  management team that achieves the target by  year  Y\r\n\r\nshould   be   given  both  bonuses  and/or  tax   breaks.\r\n\r\nIntroducing  the right incentives for them  is  the  only\r\n\r\ntrue  way of getting things done.  Otherwise, we will  be\r\n\r\ntalking  with insufficient sense of urgency as  what  our\r\n\r\ncolleague, Mr Inderjit Singh, mentioned yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot has been said about helping SMEs and taking\r\n\r\nthem overseas.  To me, the national economic strategy, if\r\n\r\nthere  is  one,  is  to  get the bigger  ones,  with  the\r\n\r\npotential to go transnational, such as the GLCs,  because\r\n\r\nthey   have   bigger  resources,  or  the  bigger   local\r\n\r\ncompanies, and then to get the SMEs to latch along.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I agree that it is difficult, it is\r\n\r\nimportant  for us to do and important for our  Government\r\n\r\nagencies  to  assist  the SMEs.   In  all  these,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  to  understand that speed and  simplicity  are\r\n\r\nimportant criteria for SME businesses.  One-stop  service\r\n\r\ncentre and meaningful value adding assistance will be  of\r\n\r\ngreat help to them.  We should cut down the red tape  for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our plant/factory focus approach to attracting\r\n\r\ninvestment  should  give way to more  process  focus  and\r\n\r\nvalue  chain focus approach to base MNCs here.  I believe\r\n\r\nsteps are already being taken in attracting MNCs to  base\r\n\r\ntheir  OHQs  here.  But the linkages in  the  economy  to\r\n\r\nexploit this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npresence  may not be sufficiently developed.  I think  we\r\n\r\nshould  go a step further in identifying the value  chain\r\n\r\nand  the production/research or design processes in these\r\n\r\nsegments of the chain to make business successes  out  of\r\n\r\nthem  for our local businesses and start-ups.  A  mapping\r\n\r\nof this should be done.  The Government has the resources\r\n\r\nto do it.  The Government should invest in such a service\r\n\r\nagency  and  get  private sector  people  who  understand\r\n\r\nbusiness  to do it.  I believe there are a lot  of  local\r\n\r\ntalents in the employment market and many of them used to\r\n\r\nwork for the MNCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a lot of advantages, especially in the\r\n\r\neducated  young  graduates  from  our  universities   and\r\n\r\npolytechnics, who are very good.  I have met many of them\r\n\r\nand  I  am really proud of them.  We should do the  right\r\n\r\nthing  by  opening the avenues.  They will do  it  right,\r\n\r\nonce the trail is blazed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems facing the economy are indeed\r\n\r\nchallenging,  to say the least.  I believe  the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  got the issues well covered.  Frankly, many  of  the\r\n\r\nissues  mentioned by the Minister in the Budget Review  - high  business  costs,  the need for  an  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\neconomy,  GLCs crowding out private sector in businesses,\r\n\r\nwhich  properly  should be left to the local  SMEs,  high\r\n\r\nstatutory costs - all sound very familiar, and have  been\r\n\r\nsaid by many of us who have been long enough here on this\r\n\r\nside of the House.  Let us hope that the remedial actions\r\n\r\nwill be implemented with speed and efficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>12.26 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nstory  is often told in Malaysia nowadays of a young  man\r\n\r\nfrom  Kedah,  who not many years ago was  a  rice  trader\r\n\r\nwandering  around  Kuala Lumpur in a  pair  of  slippers.\r\n\r\nToday, this man has varied business interests.  He has  a\r\n\r\nnet  worth of RM1.7 billion and has been ranked  the  7th\r\n\r\nwealthiest  man  in Malaysia.  He is Mokhtar  Al-Bukhary,\r\n\r\nnow better known as the man who developed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nJohor's  Tanjong Pelapas port and lured away the business\r\n\r\nof  two  big  shipping lines, Maersk and  Evergreen  from\r\n\r\nSingapore's PSA Corporation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the story does not end here. This savvy\r\n\r\nbusinessman  has now been given the green light  to  take\r\n\r\nover Senai Airport in Johor and turn it into a major  hub\r\n\r\nto   complement  the  transhipment  business  of  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPelapas and compete with our Changi Airport.  Dare we say\r\n\r\nthat  he  will  not succeed?  Certainly  not,  after  the\r\n\r\nunthinkable  happened  to PSA.  Are  we  running  scared?\r\n\r\nCertainly not too, I hope.  But what has happened  should\r\n\r\nserve  as  a  wake-up  call of what harsh  reality  in  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  world is, in that we cannot  take  customers\r\n\r\nfor granted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In business, they say that you are friends, and the\r\n\r\nrelationship stays for as long as you can make  money  of\r\n\r\none another.  If your customer finds that he has a better\r\n\r\ndeal elsewhere, he will run to your competitor, no matter\r\n\r\nhow  long he has been with you.  One important lesson  we\r\n\r\nhave  learned in this is that if you are No. 1, there  is\r\n\r\nalways  someone waiting to knock you off your perch,  and\r\n\r\nthat  someone need not be an obvious competitor like Hong\r\n\r\nKong  or  Kaoshiung, but it could be a  sleepy  backwater\r\n\r\nlike  Tanjong Pelapas.  This is because your competitors,\r\n\r\nno  matter  how  small  they  are,  play  a  game  called\r\n\r\n\"catching up\" - that is what you can do, given  time  and\r\n\r\ndetermination,  they can do too, and at a  better  price.\r\n\r\nAnd,  it  is  not just in port services that  things  are\r\n\r\nshaping up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Malaysian company launched a no-frills\r\n\r\nairline  not  long ago called Air Asia.  No champagne  or\r\n\r\nfree  gifts  on board.  Bring your own food too,  if  you\r\n\r\nlike.   It just gets you to where you want to go  without\r\n\r\nfuss and at a low price.  Amongst this week's offer,  fly\r\n\r\nfrom  Kuala  Lumpur to Penang for only  RM19.99,  cheaper\r\n\r\nthan  taking a bus ride.  No doubt it will soon be flying\r\n\r\npassengers   from   nearby   Senai   Airport   to   other\r\n\r\ndestinations at very low price and it gets you  to  where\r\n\r\nyou  want with minimal delays.  Delays are costly in  the\r\n\r\nairline business and they cannot afford to have them, not\r\n\r\nat\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  prices they sell their tickets.  So, they  are  very\r\n\r\nefficient at getting you to your destination on schedule.\r\n\r\nAnd  it  is  a  profitable company.  In the  first  eight\r\n\r\nmonths since taking over the company and operating it  as\r\n\r\na   no-frills  airline,  the  new  owners  turned  around\r\n\r\nprevious losses and made RM19 million, and they are debt-free.   Last  year, Air Asia flew 1.3 million passengers.\r\n\r\nThis year, it is aiming for 2 million passengers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While airlines like SIA cater to their own niche\r\n\r\nluxury markets, here is one airline that has carved a new\r\n\r\nmarket for itself by reaching out to those who could  not\r\n\r\nafford to fly before, or those who are simply looking for\r\n\r\na  better  deal  in air travel, especially  during  these\r\n\r\ndifficult  times.  I am glad that SilkAir is  sitting  up\r\n\r\nand  has  taken notice of the competition it  faces  from\r\n\r\nairlines like Air Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our healthcare industry is another example of how an\r\n\r\nindustry  is  feeling the heat from regional competitors.\r\n\r\nAt one time, we had Indonesians and Malaysians queuing up\r\n\r\nat our private hospitals for treatment.  Today, they, and\r\n\r\neven  others from as far as Europe, are going to  Malacca\r\n\r\nor  to  Bangkok for surgery, because the costs, including\r\n\r\ntravelling  and expenses, work out to be only a  fraction\r\n\r\nof what it would cost here, and the standards match ours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, to stay alive in a lacklustre economy,\r\n\r\ncompanies  have learned very quickly that  they  need  to\r\n\r\noffer  better  value for less money.  A New Paper  report\r\n\r\ntwo  days  ago  highlighted how companies in  the  luxury\r\n\r\ngoods business now offer lower-end versions of their high-end  products  to appeal to middle income consumers.   It\r\n\r\ncites the example of Jaguar which now markets its X  type\r\n\r\ncars  at  half  the  price  of  its  top-end  XJ  series.\r\n\r\nSimilarly  too, as in the case of Mercedes Benz,  pushing\r\n\r\nits  C Class and A Class cars at less than half the price\r\n\r\nof its top of the range models.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consumer, I too am looking out for better deals\r\n\r\nwhenever I need something.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTwo  years ago, I bought my first DVD player, a  Philips.\r\n\r\nIt cost me $750.  Three months ago, I bought another one,\r\n\r\nthis  time a Samsung, a Korean brand and it cost me  only\r\n\r\n$180   -   slimmer, sleeker, great features and generally\r\n\r\neasier to operate.  People may say that there is a  great\r\n\r\ndifference  between  the  two  brands,  but  I  have  not\r\n\r\ndiscovered  any  loss  in the quality  of  the  movies  I\r\n\r\nwatched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Singapore company has learned to carve its own\r\n\r\nniche during these bad times too.  This is a company that\r\n\r\nmakes  electronic products in China under its  own  brand\r\n\r\nname  Akira.  Recently, Akira was selling 21-inch  colour\r\n\r\nTV sets at $190, and friends who have bought them tell me\r\n\r\nthat  they are of good quality.  I tried to buy one   but\r\n\r\nthey were all sold out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I give these examples to make some points.\r\n\r\nFirstly, never underestimate the competition.  We have to\r\n\r\nbe   flexible  in  doing  things  to  meet  threats   and\r\n\r\nchallenges  because,  out there,  there  will  always  be\r\n\r\nsomeone  who will try to do things better than  you  can.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  even  in a flagging economy, one  can  find  a\r\n\r\nniche and seize opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to make is that today, people\r\n\r\nhave wised up to the fact that good quality need not mean\r\n\r\nhigh  prices.  In other words, whether you are a shipping\r\n\r\nline  or  you  are  just shopping for  electronic  goods,\r\n\r\npeople  are  looking  for  better  deals.   If  PSA   had\r\n\r\nrecognised this fundamental point, it might not have lost\r\n\r\ntwo of its biggest customers.  How did the world's number\r\n\r\none  port, long vaunted by the Government as a  model  of\r\n\r\nefficient  management,  end  up  an  enigma  of   bloated\r\n\r\ncapacity?  How did 500 of its employees end up swallowing\r\n\r\nthe  bitter pill of retrenchment and find out that  they,\r\n\r\nand  not  the sacred cows of the Singapore economy,  were\r\n\r\nthe  ones  being slaughtered?  Who can blame  those,  not\r\n\r\njust the PSA employees but many others in the public  and\r\n\r\nthe private sectors, who have lost their jobs for the way\r\n\r\nthey  feel  now?   It  was  not too  long  ago  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore worker was held up as the number one worker  in\r\n\r\nthe world.  Now, the number one worker finds that being\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnumber  one is like winning a race with no prizes at  the\r\n\r\nend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is not just with land cost, as some\r\n\r\nMembers have pointed out.  It has to do with the way  you\r\n\r\nhandle your customers, so that you retain their patronage\r\n\r\nthrough  good  and bad times.  It is all  about  business\r\n\r\nphilosophy  and attitude.  Give the guy a good  deal,  he\r\n\r\nstays  with  you.  But sometimes I know  it  is  hard  to\r\n\r\nchange  mindsets.   We are quite used to  the  Government\r\n\r\nmantra,  that if you want better services,  you  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  pay  more   -  be it  hospital  charges  or\r\n\r\ntransport  fares.  We have gone through this  last  year,\r\n\r\nbut I think the mindset still remains.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we are told that to ensure that taxis provide\r\n\r\nbetter  services, there is a need to monitor  them.   LTA\r\n\r\nsays, pay $50 per taxi per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> $25.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> $25, sorry. $25 per taxi per\r\n\r\nmonth.   With  19,000 taxis, that is a  cool  $6  million\r\n\r\ncollected  a year.  Will this result in solving  problems\r\n\r\nsuch   that  taxis  disappear  mysteriously  just  before\r\n\r\nmidnight  and  appearing suddenly when the midnight  hour\r\n\r\nstrikes?  I think not.  Will we now be able to get  taxis\r\n\r\nwhen  it rains?  I think not.  Will taxi companies absorb\r\n\r\nthis  additional charge in the long run?   I  think  not.\r\n\r\nWill passengers end up paying for this?  I think so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or try the URA for its own brand of service - pay\r\n\r\n$1,200  upfront when you apply for a change  of  use  for\r\n\r\nyour premises.  Sir, I do not wish to repeat what Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nHan  Shih wrote in his article.  It is all in the Streats\r\n\r\nnewspaper of 5th February.  He wondered how the URA  does\r\n\r\nits  costing  and  lamented that  it  is  a  very  costly\r\n\r\nservice.   Still,  it is $1,200 per application,  whether\r\n\r\nyou  are  successful or not.  And with 2,600 applications\r\n\r\nbeing  processed a year, you can do your own calculations\r\n\r\nhow  much that works out to.  This is very lucrative work\r\n\r\nfor  the URA but it just adds one more item to the  heavy\r\n\r\ncost of doing business here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it is high cost that is making us less\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  Mr Koo Tsai Kee can argue that we  are  not\r\n\r\nmuch  more  expensive than Guangzhou in terms  of  office\r\n\r\nspace,  but  I  want to tell him that every dollar  saved\r\n\r\ncounts today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh said that it is hard to shake off\r\n\r\nthe  impression  that  we are an expensive  place  to  do\r\n\r\nbusiness to his foreign friends.  I agree with him.   How\r\n\r\ncan  we  do that when this is the reality?   And it  does\r\n\r\nnot  help  us  to shake off this image when some  of  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  that  the  Government implements  are  labelled\r\n\r\nmerely 'reliefs'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reliefs are helpful. I do concede. But they\r\n\r\nare  what they are  -  reliefs  -  a balm to relieve  you\r\n\r\ntemporarily,  make you feel good for a while.   But  when\r\n\r\nthe  effects wear off, the pain returns because the  root\r\n\r\ncauses  have not been dealt with.  Many businessmen  tell\r\n\r\nme,  \"why  can't  the  one-off  measures  or  reliefs  be\r\n\r\npermanent ones?\"  We need a permanency to these  measures\r\n\r\nso  that we know the savings are here to stay.  We cannot\r\n\r\nplan on the basis that you tweak with these measures  now\r\n\r\nand  then.   I  too would say that the Government  should\r\n\r\nhave, once and for all, taken the opportunity to take the\r\n\r\nbull  by the horns and not let business and industry play\r\n\r\nthe  guessing game as to when the next round  of  rebates\r\n\r\nwill  come.   And this is what I feel is amiss,  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nBudget  2003  -  that it may not have provided sufficient\r\n\r\nstimulus to kick-start the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Morgan Stanley report that I read says that this\r\n\r\nyear's Budget gives little support to a fragile Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy.   Sir, the report points out that the  estimated\r\n\r\ndeficit  at $900 million works out to less than  0.8%  of\r\n\r\nGDP,  and  that  this might turn out to be even  smaller,\r\n\r\ngiven  the  tendency to conservatively estimate revenues.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  if you look at last year's revised figures,  Net\r\n\r\nInvestment  Income  (NII) was $3.8 billion   -   happily,\r\n\r\n$1.4 billion more than was originally forecast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some MPs have already pointed out that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  did  not incur a deficit last  year  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact, actually crossed the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfinishing line with a budgetary surplus of $1/2  billion.\r\n\r\nThe  transfers  to the Lifelong Education  Fund  and  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Endowment  Fund are exactly  what  they  are   - transfers  from one account to another.  They are  monies\r\n\r\nthat  remain with the Government and are not spent.  What\r\n\r\nis  spent from these two accounts are the interests  they\r\n\r\nearned,  just  like the way interests and dividends  from\r\n\r\nNII  are spent, but not the principal amounts.  So averse\r\n\r\nas  I  am  to  red ink, I must say that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance tried very hard to show a deficit last year,  but\r\n\r\nI think he just could not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would argue this point further. The Lifelong\r\n\r\nEducation Fund has a capital of $1 billion.  In its  last\r\n\r\nreported  financial year, it earned $27  million  and  it\r\n\r\ngave  away  grants  of $141/2 million.   After  deducting\r\n\r\nexpenses,  it  still  ended up  with  a  surplus  of  $10\r\n\r\nmillion.   It  has  another accumulated  surplus  of  $10\r\n\r\nmillion from previous years.  I know the long-term target\r\n\r\nis  to raise the fund to $5 billion.  But if the fund is,\r\n\r\nin fact, able to more than meet its current needs, why do\r\n\r\nwe need to increase its capital now?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, for Medifund. It has a capital sum of\r\n\r\n$800  million.  In its last financial year, it earned  an\r\n\r\nincome  of  $30  million.  Even with its  close  to  100%\r\n\r\napproval rate, it gave grants of $27 million and  it  has\r\n\r\nan  accumulated surplus of more than $35 million.   Would\r\n\r\nit  not  be  right to say that these funds are  presently\r\n\r\nself-sufficient and we need not transfer  money  at  this\r\n\r\ntime?   After all, the Government did say previously that\r\n\r\ntransfers  to these funds would take place only  when  we\r\n\r\nenjoy healthy surpluses.  And this may not be the time to\r\n\r\ndo  so simply because, firstly, we are not having healthy\r\n\r\nsurpluses;  and,  secondly,  the  funds  themselves   are\r\n\r\ngenerating enough to serve their present needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of funds with surpluses brings me to\r\n\r\nanother  point of how I think the Government should  also\r\n\r\nexamine  its  revenue sources by taking  a  look  at  the\r\n\r\nfinancial position of some of our statutory\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nboards.     Sir,   under   the   Statutory   Corporations\r\n\r\n(Contributions  to Consolidated Fund)  Act,  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  is  empowered to require  statutory  boards  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  part  of  their incomes to  the  Consolidated\r\n\r\nFund.  Statutory boards today provide services that  were\r\n\r\nonce  the  function of the Government and their  revenues\r\n\r\nand   surpluses  would  have  accrued  directly  to   the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund if they had remained so.   This  throws\r\n\r\nup  two questions.  Firstly, can the Finance Minister ask\r\n\r\nfor  more from the statutory boards that are making money\r\n\r\nto  boost the revenue position?  Secondly, what about the\r\n\r\nlarge  accumulated surpluses that some of  them  have  in\r\n\r\ntheir books?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us just take a look at the last reported\r\n\r\nfinancial year of some of them.  Jurong Town Corporation,\r\n\r\naccumulated  surplus,  $8.6  billion;  net  profit,  $112\r\n\r\nmillion   after   contributing   $50   million   to   the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, net profit,\r\n\r\n$333  million; after returning $1 billion to  Government,\r\n\r\nit is still left with $2.3 billion accumulated surplus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Utilities Board, accumulated surplus, $4.3\r\n\r\nbillion at group level; net profit, $412 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URA, accumulated surplus, $1.3 billion; net profit,\r\n\r\n$29  million  after  contributing $91/2  million  to  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, statutory boards usually take the position that\r\n\r\nsuch   surpluses   are  necessary  for   future   capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure.   But  can we not require  them  to  justify\r\n\r\ntheir  retention of large surpluses with  concrete  plans\r\n\r\nand  if they cannot do so within a fixed period of  time,\r\n\r\nto  return the money to the Government so that it can  be\r\n\r\nput  to better use?  In fact, under the Act, the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  the power to require the statutory boards to  return\r\n\r\nto  Government any amount that is not required  for  that\r\n\r\nboard's  duties and functions.  If the money  is  sitting\r\n\r\nthere for a long time, I think we have to take a look  at\r\n\r\nthat.  Even if the boards require capital outlays, should\r\n\r\nwe  not ask them now to fund these by going to the  money\r\n\r\nmarket through such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninstruments  as  bond issues?  After  all,  they  operate\r\n\r\nsuccessful  businesses and should be able to raise  their\r\n\r\nown  funds as and when they need them.  Ultimately,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  will leave the Minister for Finance some extra room\r\n\r\nto manoeuvre the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, having listened to Mdm Ho Geok Choo,   let\r\n\r\nme  share some of my thoughts on an effective way to meet\r\n\r\nthe challenge, before I speak on the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an open economic environment, we should throw\r\n\r\naway all our historical baggage.  Both the employers  and\r\n\r\nemployees  should  change their way  of  thinking,  their\r\n\r\nmindset.  It  should  not be confined  to  the  employees\r\n\r\nalone.   I think a collective agreement is still  a  very\r\n\r\neffective  tool  in  managing  the  relationship  between\r\n\r\nemployers and employees in the open economy.  The problem\r\n\r\nis  not  in its form, but rather in whether the employers\r\n\r\nhave also raised the transparency of their operations and\r\n\r\nshare  all the information with the workers in an  honest\r\n\r\nmanner.  In  this way, the workers would  understand  the\r\n\r\nterms  and conditions of their employment, and would  not\r\n\r\nharbour  the  impression that the employer is  exploiting\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A collective agreement is made after negotiations\r\n\r\nwhere the terms therein are mutually agreed upon.  It  is\r\n\r\nan  assurance extended by the employers and employees  to\r\n\r\none  another.   I  want  to  emphasise  that  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement in Singapore is an enlightened one.  I also hope\r\n\r\nthat  our  employers would understand that, although  the\r\n\r\niron  rice  bowl concept in some countries  is  outdated,\r\n\r\nthis  concept  has not been in existence in Singapore  at\r\n\r\nall.   No one can say in Singapore that his rice bowl  is\r\n\r\ncast  in  steel  and  would not be  broken.   Everybody's\r\n\r\nricebowl  can be broken.  However, in reality,  we  would\r\n\r\nnot  like  to  see any employee being looked  upon  as  a\r\n\r\ndisposable utensil - one that is used and discarded  when\r\n\r\nhis usefulness is no more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be it employee or employer, their rice bowls are\r\n\r\ninterconnected  and  cannot  be  separated.    Both   the\r\n\r\nemployers and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemployees  should  share the fruit  of  success  and  the\r\n\r\nprosperity  of their enterprises.  Whether  employers  or\r\n\r\nemployees,  they  are  all human  beings,  they  are  not\r\n\r\nmachines  or  merchandise.  We do not  want  to  see  the\r\n\r\nemployees  being  left to the mercy of  their  employers,\r\n\r\njust  like a hunter going hunting with his dog,  captures\r\n\r\nhis  prey,  then kills his dog and eats  it.   People  in\r\n\r\npersonnel   departments  should  be  open-minded.    More\r\n\r\nimportantly,  all the people in the company  should  feel\r\n\r\nthat  their contributions and efforts put in are rewarded\r\n\r\naccordingly.  Therefore, I hope the management should  be\r\n\r\nforesighted  enough to warn their workers to prepare  for\r\n\r\nthe challenges they will meet ahead of them.  They should\r\n\r\nbe  committed  in  looking after  the  welfare  of  their\r\n\r\nemployees  and give them due protection and  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the theme of DPM's Budget Speech\r\n\r\nwas \"Seizing Opportunity in Uncertainty\".  I want to take\r\n\r\nthe  message one step further.  Not only should we  seize\r\n\r\nopportunities  in  uncertainty, we must  \"turn  adversity\r\n\r\ninto strength\".  Let me elaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic downturn has hit Singaporeans hard. We\r\n\r\nmust  help  Singaporeans to restore their confidence,  so\r\n\r\nthat they could be at ease when faced with adversity.  As\r\n\r\na  union  leader,  I have experienced,  first  hand,  the\r\n\r\nimpact of the downturn on our workers.  Many workers  and\r\n\r\npeople have lost their jobs.  Those who are still holding\r\n\r\non to their jobs face salary freeze or wage cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that the Deputy Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nannounced  measures to help workers and Singaporeans.   I\r\n\r\napplaud these measures, especially for the assistance  in\r\n\r\nmanpower  training.  $37 million has been  set  aside  to\r\n\r\nenhance   MOM's   employment  assistance   and   training\r\n\r\nprogrammes aimed at generating 20,000 additional training\r\n\r\nplaces under the Skills Redevelopment Programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree with Mr Tan Soo Khoon that our\r\n\r\nexpenditure  should not be based on past experience.   We\r\n\r\nshould  look at our past and present situations and  make\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnecessary   adjustment.  We  should  give   our   workers\r\n\r\nconfidence by job creation and employment assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has accepted the\r\n\r\nERC's  recommendations.  These measures will enhance  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,  nurture entrepreneurship,   grow  local\r\n\r\nenterprises  and  strengthen  our  human  capital.    But\r\n\r\nwhatever  benefits they may bring about, the workers  are\r\n\r\nstill primarily concerned with  job security and a steady\r\n\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Lee disclosed that the\r\n\r\ninvestments that Singapore has attracted are expected  to\r\n\r\ncreate  21,000 jobs.  However, if the economic  situation\r\n\r\ndoes  not improve, our unemployment rate will go up  from\r\n\r\n4.4%  to  5.5%  this year.  I understand that  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain  external factors which are outside our  control.\r\n\r\nFor  example, will there be a war in Iraq?  How will  the\r\n\r\nthreat of terrorism unfold?  Will the major economies  of\r\n\r\nUS,  Japan  and  the European countries remain  sluggish?\r\n\r\nAll  these  factors  add  to our uncertainty.   They  are\r\n\r\nbeyond  our control.  But our people are hoping that  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  do  more in the areas  where  we  have\r\n\r\ncontrol   over.   In  fact,  many  of  my   parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues have elaborated on how to cut down the cost of\r\n\r\ndoing business in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Deputy Prime Minister Lee has announced\r\n\r\nthe  extension of various rebates and reductions in  cost\r\n\r\nfor businesses to the end of this year.  Many people have\r\n\r\nasked:  \"Why  not give a firm commitment to  extend  them\r\n\r\nfurther?\"   After  all, the deferment of CPF  restoration\r\n\r\nfor two years has been accepted by the workers and it has\r\n\r\nsent  a  clear signal to investors.  Why not send another\r\n\r\nsignal  to  investors by cutting down business costs  for\r\n\r\ntwo years?  We hope that they can expand their businesses\r\n\r\nhere, and many jobs can then be preserved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern of the workers is in the area of\r\n\r\nhealthcare.   If  we want the workers  to  upgrade  their\r\n\r\nskills,  to enhance their competitiveness, they  must  be\r\n\r\nassured\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  when  they  are sick, they can have  some  form  of\r\n\r\nprotection  against  illnesses. DPM  Lee  said  that  our\r\n\r\nnational healthcare expenditure is now 3.5% of GDP, which\r\n\r\nis  lower than most of the developed countries.  He  also\r\n\r\nsaid that the low expenditure was not entirely because of\r\n\r\nour  efficient healthcare system, but rather due  to  our\r\n\r\nyounger  population.  What worries  me  is  that  if  our\r\n\r\npopulation has the same age profile as, for example,  the\r\n\r\nUK   and   Japan,   then  our  national  expenditure   on\r\n\r\nhealthcare, based on our present spending patterns, would\r\n\r\nbe near to UK and Japan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there is another set of statistics that\r\n\r\nwe  should  also be aware of.  Our healthcare expenditure\r\n\r\nin  dollar terms has increased fourfold from $1.3 billion\r\n\r\nin  1990 to $5.6 billion in 2001.  Are we heading towards\r\n\r\nthe  problem  we currently see in healthcare  systems  in\r\n\r\nsome  developed countries?  In the US, many  workers  are\r\n\r\nnot  covered by medical insurance.  When they are in need\r\n\r\nof  medical treatment, they are in a dilemma.  We are all\r\n\r\ntoo  familiar  with  the  three  fundamental  pillars  of\r\n\r\nhealthcare  financing in Singapore - the  3Ms  (Medisave,\r\n\r\nMediShield and Medifund).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget Speech, DPM Lee announced a $100\r\n\r\nmillion  special  transfer  to  Medifund  to  help   more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  He also announced the phasing-in of higher\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates to Medisave.  My  question  is:  what\r\n\r\nabout  MediShield?   Is  the Government  looking  at  how\r\n\r\nMediShield can also be enhanced and modified?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the implementation of policy, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should also consider reviewing  the  criteria\r\n\r\nfor use of Medisave to be more responsive and appropriate\r\n\r\nto  today's  needs.  For example, to  allow  the  use  of\r\n\r\nMedisave  based  on  medical conditions  instead  of  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of days of hospitalisation.  Right now,  many  of\r\n\r\nthem  still  have  to  fork out cash  to  pay  for  their\r\n\r\ntreatment  at  the clinics.  Today, 90%  of  the  working\r\n\r\npopulation  are covered under MediShield or  one  of  the\r\n\r\nMedisave-approved insurance schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, MOH has improved the\r\n\r\nbenefits and features of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMediShield.   I believe that the Government can  continue\r\n\r\nto  enhance  MediShield  to make  it  more  relevant  and\r\n\r\nresponsive.   However, we know that MediShield  is  quite\r\n\r\nnear  to  portable  medical  benefits.   It  can  provide\r\n\r\nportable medical benefits as long as the premium is paid,\r\n\r\nwhether  the  insured is still working  or  out  of  job.\r\n\r\nHowever, this system has been in existence for quite some\r\n\r\ntime.    It  does  not  cover  specialist  treatment   in\r\n\r\noutpatient clinics or hospitalisation.  I wonder  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  review  or revamp  MediShield  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection.  I am also concerned that more than a  quarter\r\n\r\nof   a   million  of  Singaporeans  have  opted  out   of\r\n\r\nMediShield,  although 90% of the people are  still  being\r\n\r\ncovered by MediShield.  There are 270,000 people who  are\r\n\r\nnot covered by this scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the fundamental healthcare financing\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  it  should  be made  a  compulsory  national\r\n\r\nmedical  insurance for all Singaporeans so that they  can\r\n\r\nhave a basic medical insurance coverage for their medical\r\n\r\nneeds.   I  feel  that every Singaporean should  have  at\r\n\r\nleast  a basic medical insurance coverage, and we  should\r\n\r\nmake  it compulsory.  As union leaders, we are in contact\r\n\r\nwith  workers every day.  There are many problems.   When\r\n\r\nthey are jobless or retrenched, they will not be able  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  any  medical  benefits, especially  with  all  the\r\n\r\nturnover   in   jobs  and  instability  in  their   jobs.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the Government should widen the coverage  and\r\n\r\nimprove the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, all CPF members should be allowed to use\r\n\r\ntheir  savings in the Medisave accounts to  pay  for  the\r\n\r\npremiums  for all portable medical insurance.   According\r\n\r\nto the ERC's recommendations, employers should contribute\r\n\r\nat  least 1% of their CPF for this purpose.  But  members\r\n\r\ncannot  make  use of this amount to pay the  premium  for\r\n\r\nthis kind of medical insurance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Government should step up its education\r\n\r\nand  publicity  efforts both for the  employees  and  the\r\n\r\nemployers on the merits of portable medical benefits.  As\r\n\r\nunion  leaders, we want to see a seamless and  affordable\r\n\r\nmedical benefits system\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  is  relevant  to their needs,  and  one  that  will\r\n\r\nprovide  coverage for the workers not only  during  their\r\n\r\nworking life but even after their retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare financing has a long-term implication on\r\n\r\nour   national   budget.  Besides   phasing   in   higher\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates for Medisave, the Government  has  to\r\n\r\nconsider measures that will facilitate greater pooling of\r\n\r\nrisks,  such  as  making MediShield  a  compulsory  basic\r\n\r\nnational medical insurance scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a greying population means an\r\n\r\nageing  workforce.   We do not want to  see  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfinding  themselves unable to cope with their  healthcare\r\n\r\nneeds in the future.  We do not want our older workers to\r\n\r\nbe  disadvantaged if employers are reluctant to hire them\r\n\r\nbecause   of  higher  healthcare  cost.   We  feel   that\r\n\r\nportability  in medical benefits is a good  system.   But\r\n\r\nGovernment should supplement this with other schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, history is the best judge of\r\n\r\nsuccesses and failures.  When we look back at this year's\r\n\r\nbudget,  several years down the road, what would we  see?\r\n\r\nWe  would see this Budget as a turning point in  the  re-engineering  of Singapore.  It will not be  just  another\r\n\r\ndull   Budget,  as  described  by  some  cynics  in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.    In   such   a  difficult   and   uncertain\r\n\r\nenvironment,  it  is  important  for  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nclearly reassure Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can expect a budget deficit of $90 million for\r\n\r\nfinancial  year 2002 and our projected budget deficit  is\r\n\r\n$900  million  for  the next financial  year.   Yet,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government is contributing $100 million to  top\r\n\r\nup  the  Medifund.   This is a change from  the  previous\r\n\r\ninstance  where the Medifund was topped up only  when  we\r\n\r\nhad  budget surpluses.  This is a clear way of reassuring\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are  worried  about  their  healthcare\r\n\r\ncosts.  Whether in sickness or in health, in boom  or  in\r\n\r\nrecession,  and  whether  we  have  budget  surpluses  or\r\n\r\ndeficit, the Government will help them.  This is  like  a\r\n\r\nmarriage vow!\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should constantly reaffirm that the Government\r\n\r\nhas the best interest of Singaporeans at heart. We should\r\n\r\nassure  the workers and those who are disadvantaged  that\r\n\r\nwe have a strong social safety net, including appropriate\r\n\r\nhealthcare   subsidies  and  measures  that   will   help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans cope with their healthcare needs.  Only with\r\n\r\nsuch  firm  reassurances and practical economic  measures\r\n\r\nproposed  by  the  ERC, then as a nation,  we  can  brace\r\n\r\nourselves for the changes and challenges ahead of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> I would like to seek your\r\n\r\npermission to clarify Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's response to the\r\n\r\npart  of my speech where I had referred to the collective\r\n\r\nagreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Carry on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Thank you, Sir. In advocating\r\n\r\nfor  a  flexi future, I have identified, as  one  of  the\r\n\r\ndomains, collective agreements to promote a flexi culture\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  Unfortunately, Mr Yeo has, in one sweeping\r\n\r\nstatement, inferred my suggestion as doing away with  the\r\n\r\ncollective  agreements  and has cast  my  speech  out  of\r\n\r\ncontext.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate once again and please bear\r\n\r\nwith  me as I go through the significant portion  on  the\r\n\r\nCA.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Make it concise, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> On collective agreements, I have\r\n\r\nsaid  that  employers and unions may even need to  review\r\n\r\nthe  terms  and conditions in CA so as to help  employers\r\n\r\nbetter manage the manpower cost.  I gave the example  and\r\n\r\nasked  why should we not be looking at some of the  fixed\r\n\r\nitems  in  CAs  which have actually entrenched  the  good\r\n\r\npractices  of  management, especially  in  this  volatile\r\n\r\ntime, and I have called them \"grandfather baggages\".  For\r\n\r\nexample,  in this volatile time, why should we  have  CAs\r\n\r\nsigned for three years?  Can we not have a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshorter  period?  Very often, in the three-year duration,\r\n\r\nannual  increments be made fixed for three years.   If  a\r\n\r\ncompany were to lose money, say, in the second year,  the\r\n\r\ncompany is entrenched into having to pay the same  amount\r\n\r\nof annual increment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also said that, in anticipation of the\r\n\r\nreaction  of our labour MP, we can argue that CA  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  a negotiable item between the employer  and  the\r\n\r\nunion.   But  I  have mentioned that because negotiations\r\n\r\ncan  sometimes  be so protracted, running into  three  or\r\n\r\nfour  years,  before you can sign a CA, it can  sometimes\r\n\r\nend up as one of the causes for companies not looking  at\r\n\r\ntrimming the entrenched practices and taking the easy way\r\n\r\nout  by  trimming  away  the  workforce,  instead  of  by\r\n\r\nremoving  some of these fixed items.  So I have suggested\r\n\r\nthat  it is time to rethink the structure and purpose  of\r\n\r\nCAs  in  the  New Economy, just as the unions  have  been\r\n\r\nevolving  over  these  years  to  make  their  role  more\r\n\r\nrelevant.   Nowhere have I suggested that we  cast  aside\r\n\r\nCAs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also made a point about why we have to look\r\n\r\nat some of the rigidities in CAs ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mdm Ho, could you please cut it short?\r\n\r\nYou are making another speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Just one last point. Because the\r\n\r\nfixed  items  actually would be inherited  by  newcomers.\r\n\r\nWhen  newcomers inherit the fixed items, you  can  go  on\r\n\r\nweeding off employees by retrenching them.  But,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  you  have new employees  growing  into  the\r\n\r\nrigidities of the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish to thank you for allowing me to\r\n\r\nparticipate in this debate.  As a Singaporean  and  based\r\n\r\non   the   feedback  that  I  have  received  from   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  I  have no qualms in saying  that  we  are\r\n\r\nproud to be citizens of a country that has achieved a lot\r\n\r\nof progress.  There are many factors that have made us  a\r\n\r\nsuccessful country.  Among others, I would like to  state\r\n\r\nonly two.  First, is the existence of a strong and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndynamic  leadership.   This is  found  in  the  political\r\n\r\nleadership,  civil service and the private sector.    All\r\n\r\nwho  are  at  the  leadership level are working  hard  in\r\n\r\ngiving  the  best  services for  the  well-being  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry, companies, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a second factor that I feel is\r\n\r\nimportant.   We have a capable and hardworking community,\r\n\r\nfrom  the private as well as the public sectors, to  work\r\n\r\ntogether  in  order to make Singapore  a  prosperous  and\r\n\r\nprogressive  country.   Mr Speaker,  the  combination  of\r\n\r\nthese  two  factors  and other factors  which  have  been\r\n\r\ndebated by our colleagues in this House have strengthened\r\n\r\nSingapore's economy.  We are also recognised as the  best\r\n\r\nworkforce  in the world and we have also been  successful\r\n\r\nin making Changi Airport the best airport in the world in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with Singapore Airlines which  is  also  the\r\n\r\nbest.   Year by year, it has been ranked as the  best  in\r\n\r\nthe airline service worldwide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there were retrenchments in PSA recently,\r\n\r\nwe  also know that our port is still one of the best  and\r\n\r\nmost  efficient in the world.  Likewise, as a  result  of\r\n\r\nthe  combination  that  I  have  mentioned  earlier,  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living of Singaporeans and the  quality  of\r\n\r\nlife is the best not only in Asia but the world too.   As\r\n\r\na  Singaporean, I realise that, in many areas,  for  more\r\n\r\nthan  two decades, we have been enjoying a good life,  we\r\n\r\nhave been enjoying the wealth that allows us to speak not\r\n\r\nonly  in  terms of improving our standard of  living  but\r\n\r\nalso  a  better  quality of life.  In the constituencies,\r\n\r\nour  Members  frequently hear appeals for us  to  provide\r\n\r\nmore  linkways  and  additional facilities  in  order  to\r\n\r\nimprove and make it easier for the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to urge Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nthink  again on how, as we face the situation at present,\r\n\r\nafter having successfully built our nation, today we  are\r\n\r\nfacing a crisis which has been on-going since 1999.   Are\r\n\r\nwe  able  to overcome this crisis effectively?  Secondly,\r\n\r\nare  we  prepared  to  face this crisis  with  the  right\r\n\r\nattitude?   What I mean is: do we only want  to  face  it\r\n\r\nlightly and do not want\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto face the difficulties posed by the new challenges that\r\n\r\nwe  face?  Are we hoping that a group of people, be it in\r\n\r\nthe Government or elsewhere, can spring out a new formula\r\n\r\nto  resolve our problems immediately?  Or are we prepared\r\n\r\nto  work hard and struggle together to once again rebuild\r\n\r\nour  own  strengths and niches that we have  built  since\r\n\r\nindependence?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we have a question to ponder. Although I am\r\n\r\nconfident    that   our   Singaporeans   are   practical,\r\n\r\nhardworking  and  dare  to struggle  to  continue  making\r\n\r\nSingapore  a  successful country, there  are  also  signs\r\n\r\nwhich  at  times are worrying.  Today, we often hear  the\r\n\r\neffect and consequence of the wealth that we have enjoyed\r\n\r\nfor  so  long  has  caused Singaporeans to  complain  and\r\n\r\ncriticise  the  situation.  This is not a  reaction  that\r\n\r\nwill  generate more ideas on how to face the problems  of\r\n\r\nthe  country  that affect its people, which  could  bring\r\n\r\nabout  problems to our future.  Can we face it in  a  way\r\n\r\nthat could build up new advantages and strengths in which\r\n\r\nwe  are  able to provide goods and services to the global\r\n\r\nmarketplace?   I am worried because, among  some  of  the\r\n\r\nfactors which made us strong and successful, in the  end,\r\n\r\nthese successes and strengths could be factors that would\r\n\r\nweaken our country and community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what I meant here is whether the effect\r\n\r\nof  our wealthy lifestyle has brought about an impact  on\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  think  that  we  should   always   live\r\n\r\ncomfortably  and  find  an easy way  out  when  facing  a\r\n\r\ncrisis.  I ponder on these questions when I was on my way\r\n\r\nto the office this morning when I saw a young Singaporean\r\n\r\nman  in  his  mid-30s or early 40s.  I saw  him  using  a\r\n\r\nmotorised  bicycle.  I thought to myself: is it necessary\r\n\r\nfor  a  strong and healthy man to use a motorised bicycle\r\n\r\nto  travel from his house to a shop which is not too  far\r\n\r\naway?   The  question is: is it wise for this young  man,\r\n\r\nwho is not the only one using the motorised bicycle which\r\n\r\nis  getting popular nowadays, to use a motorised  bicycle\r\n\r\nto  travel from his house to the shop?  Is it because  he\r\n\r\nwants  to save time so as to reach his destination  fast,\r\n\r\nor  is it because of other reasons?  I was unable to  ask\r\n\r\nhim as I was driving.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am worried whether this is an indication that,\r\n\r\nin  many issues which include travelling to a place which\r\n\r\nis  not too far away, Singaporeans would like to find the\r\n\r\neasiest way out, just press a button and you get what you\r\n\r\nwant, you reach your destination.  We press the button to\r\n\r\nuse  the  lift or escalator and we ask for more linkways.\r\n\r\nMany hon. Members of Parliament have heard complaints  by\r\n\r\nthe  residents  about  providing a bus  stop  near  their\r\n\r\nhomes.   If  given  a  job they  prefer  it  to  be  air-conditioned,  because if it is too hot,  they  would  get\r\n\r\nheadaches, and if their working places are too far  away,\r\n\r\nthey  find  it  a waste of time.  These are  the  reasons\r\n\r\nwhich  are  frequently heard nowadays.  I see this  young\r\n\r\nman as another sign.  Is it true that we are weakened  by\r\n\r\nour own progress and wealth?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question arises as I am comparing how some\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens  whom  I  have met  in  my  constituency\r\n\r\nfrequently cycle from one place to another.  I have asked\r\n\r\nthem  why they like to cycle.  There are two reasons  for\r\n\r\nthis.   Firstly,  they said that it is  a  good  form  of\r\n\r\nexercise  whenever they have to travel from home  to  the\r\n\r\nshops,  mosque  or anywhere else.  It not  only  improves\r\n\r\ntheir  health  but also helps them to save  money.   Last\r\n\r\nweek,  I  met a 70-year-old man.  He is a trishaw  rider.\r\n\r\nWhen  he  was  young, he worked very hard  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nfamily,  and  most  of his children have  grown  up  now.\r\n\r\nAlthough they live on their own and have their own house,\r\n\r\nthis Singaporean, who is more than 70 years old, is still\r\n\r\na  trishaw  rider.  I asked him whether it is tiring  for\r\n\r\nhim.  He said no.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he felt that riding the trishaw has helped\r\n\r\nhim  to maintain a healthy life.  And because of his good\r\n\r\nhealth, last year - after his wife passed away more  than\r\n\r\n10  years ago - he remarried.  He could afford to remarry\r\n\r\nas  he  is  still working and has an income.  Now  he  is\r\n\r\nmarried  to  a  lady who is half his age.   I  asked  him\r\n\r\nwhether he did fall sick from time to time or worry about\r\n\r\nremarrying  again.  His reply to me was very encouraging.\r\n\r\nHe said that he has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeen  riding  the trishaw for many years  and  has  never\r\n\r\ntaken  any medical leave.  He did not have to take  leave\r\n\r\nas he is always healthy, seldom coughs or falls sick.  He\r\n\r\nbelongs to the early generation of people.  He is so used\r\n\r\nto working hard since young to raise his family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I suppose the young Singaporean man who prefers\r\n\r\nto  use the motorised bicycle is seen as a sign of  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  whom we think are wiser, but  I  worry  if\r\n\r\nthis  is  an indication that they would find an easy  way\r\n\r\nout when faced with a problem or crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I still hope, and dare say that, in\r\n\r\ngeneral, Singaporeans have not become weak, but these are\r\n\r\nsigns which we must pay attention to.  I raise this issue\r\n\r\nwith the hope that Singaporeans realise that at times  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  trapped  by the  norms  of  our  wealthy\r\n\r\nlifestyle  during this difficult period.  We  still  find\r\n\r\npeople  with financial difficulties who are seeking  help\r\n\r\nfrom  CDCs  and CCCs but who do not want to do away  with\r\n\r\ntheir  handphones.   There  are  also  people  who   have\r\n\r\nrejected  many job offers with lower salary.   There  are\r\n\r\nsome  who  realise that their jobs will be  relocated  to\r\n\r\nother  countries, but are still reluctant to  go  through\r\n\r\nnew  courses to acquire new skills to enable them to  get\r\n\r\nbetter jobs and have careers that are long lasting in the\r\n\r\nyears to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I raise this matter to urge\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  think that, since the  1960s,  we  have\r\n\r\nprogressed not based on our ability to take the easy  way\r\n\r\nout.   I  am confident that the earlier generations,  and\r\n\r\nsome  who  have passed away, had toiled day and night  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a future for their children and now the prosperity\r\n\r\nis  enjoyed  by the younger generation.  It is  important\r\n\r\nfor  us,  when  facing the situation at present,  not  to\r\n\r\neasily  give up. Instead, we should be daring to  explore\r\n\r\nnew ideas, find new ways and work hard to bring Singapore\r\n\r\nto greater heights in the years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the illustration that I have given just\r\n\r\nnow is not necessarily true despite my concerns.  What  I\r\n\r\nhope is that,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhen facing this crisis, the solution for Singaporeans is\r\n\r\nnot  by taking the easy way out.  On the other hand, what\r\n\r\nwe  have  to do is not just by asking what the Government\r\n\r\nor the CDCs can do for us.  All these will continue to be\r\n\r\nprovided.   In  fact,  we  should  ask  what  we,  as   a\r\n\r\nSingaporean, can do or take action in order to contribute\r\n\r\ntowards  the  recovery of the economy,  and  not  be  too\r\n\r\ndependent  on  the  goodies that are  given  out  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that is my hope. I hope our fellow\r\n\r\ncitizens can think about this matter together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis is going to be a tough year for the planners and for\r\n\r\nthe  people.   Tough  for  the planners  because  of  the\r\n\r\nuncertainty  created  by the impending  war,  rising  oil\r\n\r\nprices  and China's competition; and tough for the people\r\n\r\nbecause   of   job  losses,  the  fear   and   worry   of\r\n\r\nretrenchment.  My parliamentary colleagues  have  already\r\n\r\ncovered  a  wide range of topics, including CPF  changes,\r\n\r\nbusiness costs, entrepreneurship and the bureaucracy.   I\r\n\r\ndo not propose to go over them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to draw the attention of the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister to potential social problems at our\r\n\r\nHDB  heartlands.  The last two days' debate produced some\r\n\r\nvery  strong arguments, calling for the Government to  do\r\n\r\nmore to alleviate the plight of Singaporeans affected  by\r\n\r\nthis  downturn.  Amongst many suggestions is one  calling\r\n\r\nfor  the  setting  up  of a central fund  for  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers,  into  which our Singaporeans can donate  monies\r\n\r\nand   shares   given  to  them  by  the   Government   by\r\n\r\ncontributing  their  ERS shares.   I  remember  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember, Mdm Halimah Yacob, also suggested even using  the\r\n\r\nCPF,  of  course,  with some conditions attached,  for  a\r\n\r\ncontribution  to this fund.  This call,  repeated  by  my\r\n\r\nfellow MPs, brings into focus the issue of poverty at the\r\n\r\nHDB heartlands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us can feel the difference at our MPS,\r\n\r\ncompared  two  years ago and now.  The number  of  people\r\n\r\napproaching us for financial assistance and jobs has  all\r\n\r\ngone up and, in my opinion, by at least 30%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWho  are  these  people?  They cannot fit  into  the  ERC\r\n\r\nprofile.    They   are  casualties   of   this   economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring.  They are not very well educated, and  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  them are Malays, with Chinese  and  Indians\r\n\r\nincreasing in number.  The Malays are the hardest hit  in\r\n\r\nthis economic downturn.  Many hold jobs that are affected\r\n\r\nby  the  restructuring  of  our  economy.   When  a  firm\r\n\r\nupgrades  and starts to computerise and send messages  by\r\n\r\nemails  and faxes, despatch riders and drivers  would  be\r\n\r\nout  of work.  This is true also when the firms cut cost.\r\n\r\nThe  Chinese and Indians, though smaller in numbers,  are\r\n\r\nthe  recently retrenched, and they are usually  from  the\r\n\r\nsmaller  firms.   I  spoke  to  a  Malay  who  just   got\r\n\r\nretrenched  from PSA.  He felt that he and  some  of  his\r\n\r\nfriends  were retrenched because they cost more  to  hire\r\n\r\nthan foreigners.  And I have heard of such stories at our\r\n\r\nfeedback sessions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, some of the jobs were traditionally\r\n\r\ntaken  up  by  the  less educated Singaporeans,  be  they\r\n\r\nChinese,  Malays  or  Indians.  These  jobs  are  usually\r\n\r\nmanual  and construction jobs.  But they are now lost  to\r\n\r\nforeigners.   The reasons given are that  foreigners  are\r\n\r\ncheaper  - which is true - and they are prepared to  work\r\n\r\nlonger  hours.   So,  today, we have lost  that  cushion.\r\n\r\nThese  Singaporeans, together with the sizable number  of\r\n\r\nour  mature  unemployed  workforce,  belong  to  what  we\r\n\r\ndescribe  as  \"structural  unemployed\".   They  lack  the\r\n\r\ntechnology  and  the language of the computer  age.   Our\r\n\r\nLifelong  Learning  Fund may not be within  their  reach,\r\n\r\nbecause  they are usually not unionised.  So, I  find  it\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  for them to make use of  this  Fund  for\r\n\r\ntheir retraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see some of the problems that these people\r\n\r\nface.   First,  most of them are not able  to  pay  their\r\n\r\nelectricity  and water bills.  Some live in darkness  and\r\n\r\ndepend on neighbours or relatives for water.  It is a sad\r\n\r\nsituation. This is where I ask Singapore Power to be more\r\n\r\nconsiderate.  When these people come to pay a little  bit\r\n\r\nof   their  bills,  do  not  cut  off  their  water   and\r\n\r\nelectricity supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, some are not able to pay their S&C bills,\r\n\r\nand sometimes pasting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnotices on their doors requiring them to make payments is\r\n\r\nvery  embarrassing  for them.  I  think  they  have  gone\r\n\r\nthrough  a  lot of trauma and we should be  more  careful\r\n\r\nwhen  we  implement some of the ways of recovering  these\r\n\r\nbills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, some are not able to pay their HDB loans and\r\n\r\nmortgages.   Most of us have faced this at our  meet-the-people sessions.  This is where we have to relook at  how\r\n\r\nto advise them on the restructuring of their loans for  a\r\n\r\nlonger period and also how to advise them to downgrade to\r\n\r\na   smaller   flat,  and  sometimes  this   smacks   into\r\n\r\nbureaucracy.  And this is where I urge HDB  to  pay  some\r\n\r\nattention  to this area.  Maybe we should allow  them  to\r\n\r\nrent  a  flat,  because there is no need to  insist  that\r\n\r\neverybody  must own a home.  I think rental is  a  better\r\n\r\noption for some of them.  So, we should not try to  force\r\n\r\nthem to buy a flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are not able to pay kindergarten fees,\r\n\r\nthis  is  where we can help.  All branches and CDCs  have\r\n\r\npitched  in  to  help some of these students  who  cannot\r\n\r\nafford these fees.  Education is very important.  I  make\r\n\r\nit  a  point, at my constituency, to make sure that every\r\n\r\nchild  who cannot afford should come to see me.   Because\r\n\r\nif the children are deprived of an education, it would be\r\n\r\na  great burden to their family later on because they are\r\n\r\nnot productive.  And, of course, some are not able to pay\r\n\r\nmedical  bills.   This  is something  which  many  of  us\r\n\r\nencounter at our meet-the-people sessions, and we have to\r\n\r\nlook  into  how we can help these people to manage  their\r\n\r\nadmission to hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our CDCs, NTUC Fairpirce, our own Party and, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  our education and welfare funds have all chipped\r\n\r\nin  to help this group of people.  I remember a couple of\r\n\r\nMalay  families  cried when my branch members  gave  them\r\n\r\nfood  vouchers  to  spend  for  their  Hari  Raya.  Their\r\n\r\nchildren were living on bread and water for some time.  I\r\n\r\nbring  up these examples to highlight a point that  while\r\n\r\nwe embark on this high road of economic changes, do not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nforget  that many may not be able to follow us. We  must,\r\n\r\nat  times,  look back and help the slow ones along.  This\r\n\r\nwill bind us as a nation.  This group of people will find\r\n\r\nthe  going very tough. As the economy changes, they  will\r\n\r\nfind  jobs more and more difficult to come by.  Jobs that\r\n\r\nwe  are  attracting  are beyond them.  Their  educational\r\n\r\nlevel, as I said, is low and the technology is not  there\r\n\r\nto meet the changing needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a potential social problem and we must make\r\n\r\nsure  we  address this problem.  We must make  sure  that\r\n\r\nthey  do not fall into this poverty trap or else it  will\r\n\r\nbe a big social problem for us in the years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the Budget addressed this? I think the Budget\r\n\r\nmay not have focused a lot on this area.  They have given\r\n\r\nS&C  and rental rebates.  But these rebates are for  all.\r\n\r\nEveryone living in an HDB flat gets these rebates.  It is\r\n\r\nnot targeted.  I know CDCs have helped  through financial\r\n\r\nassistance  and job matching.  But what I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsee  is  a  more structured organisation at the  national\r\n\r\nlevel  doing this function, rather than ad-hoc  measures.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can start by finding out the profiles of these\r\n\r\npeople  through  our Government agencies and  maintain  a\r\n\r\nregister  to  assist the CDCs at the ground level.   With\r\n\r\nsuch a structure in place, we may have a better feel  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the situation and take whatever measures\r\n\r\nnecessary.   And  many  a  time,  the  voluntary  welfare\r\n\r\norganisations can play an important role as  counsellors,\r\n\r\nand  their involvement will be very useful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>1.35 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Matthias Yao Chih): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship is the choice flavour  on  the  menu  in\r\n\r\nthis  Budget debate, and rightly so.  For so many  years,\r\n\r\nwe  have relied on GLCs and MNCs to grow our economy.  We\r\n\r\nneed  more entrepreneurs among Singaporeans, so that they\r\n\r\ntoo can be key drivers in the next\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nphase  of  our economic growth.  I join the many speakers\r\n\r\nbefore  me  to  support  the Government's  intention  and\r\n\r\nmeasures to promote, support and nurture entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   I support the calls to price  industrial\r\n\r\nland competitively, and cut red tape.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much talk about entrepreneurship has,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  caused workers to feel rather  left  out.\r\n\r\nThey  think  that  this  debate is  for  businessmen  and\r\n\r\ninvestors only. Workers are mentioned only when  it  came\r\n\r\nto  non-restoration of CPF contributions  and  having  to\r\n\r\nwork  beyond  their retirement age.  That, to  me,  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat pity.  It would be a limited view of the ERC Report\r\n\r\nand  this year's Budget debate.  So, I was happy that MPs\r\n\r\nwho  spoke today have brought some attention back to  the\r\n\r\nneeds and worries of our workers.  Our workers should not\r\n\r\nfeel left out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this was merely a pro-business Budget and workers\r\n\r\nare  not of concern, the Minister for Finance could  have\r\n\r\nsimply focused on helping Singapore companies move abroad\r\n\r\nand  take advantage of the lower costs and larger markets\r\n\r\nin the region. That would raise profits for the companies\r\n\r\nand make many businessmen very happy.  It would also be a\r\n\r\ncheaper  and probably less complicated exercise  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   But  that is not what this  Budget  is  all\r\n\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, the Budget proposes a broad range\r\n\r\nof  calibrated  machines  aimed  at  drawing  high  value\r\n\r\ninvestments, assets, talent and know-how into  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  keeping  them here. They encourage  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nstart  and grow more businesses using Singapore as  their\r\n\r\nbase.  The emphasis this year is on our domestic economy,\r\n\r\nless on the external wing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefit goes directly to our workers.\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurs  and investors cannot do  business  all  by\r\n\r\nthemselves.  As  long as they operate in Singapore,  they\r\n\r\nmust employ at least a few staff to do the work. The more\r\n\r\nsuccessful  we can help them become, the more  they  will\r\n\r\nneed  to  employ.  And other businesses  will  emerge  to\r\n\r\nprovide  upstream, downstream and support  activities  to\r\n\r\nthese successful companies.  Meanwhile, a new statutory\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nboard and substantial funding will help the workers bring\r\n\r\nsuch opportunities that lie ahead within their reach.  It\r\n\r\nis not a zero sum game between entrepreneurs and workers.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  have is indeed a pro-business, pro-entrepreneur\r\n\r\nBudget.   But  because  it aims to attract,  nurture  and\r\n\r\nanchor  companies  to Singapore, it  is  also  a  pro-job\r\n\r\ncreation Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already heard some good news that banks and\r\n\r\nmanufacturers have decided to move more of their foreign-based operations to Singapore because of our increasingly\r\n\r\nattractive conditions.  As the Budget measures take  full\r\n\r\neffect, more companies will come, more start-ups will  be\r\n\r\nformed.  The small ones will provide only a few jobs  but\r\n\r\nthe  larger companies will bring in jobs numbering in the\r\n\r\nhundreds.   The result will be jobs, and more  jobs,  for\r\n\r\nthe  workforce. Workers are not left out of this  debate.\r\n\r\nTheir livelihood is the key concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as jobs get created, they will not be the kind\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  been used to doing. There will  be  fewer\r\n\r\npermanent  jobs, and certainly no iron rice  bowls.   The\r\n\r\nskills that are needed will keep changing, more and  more\r\n\r\nquickly. We will have to work out different ways of doing\r\n\r\nthis.  We will have to work for different employers,  and\r\n\r\neven  change industries several times within our  working\r\n\r\nlife.   Even  our collective agreements may  have  to  be\r\n\r\nlooked  at, but collective agreements will still need  to\r\n\r\nbe  the mainstay of a relationship between employers  and\r\n\r\nthe  unions.  The terms can be discussed. If we can  make\r\n\r\nthe  transition effectively, our workforce will  continue\r\n\r\nto thrive in the face of global competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship will not be just for entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nIn the future, workers too need to be entrepreneurial.  I\r\n\r\ndo not mean that all the workers should go into business.\r\n\r\nIf  some  do  want to, I would say, make  a  try,  and  I\r\n\r\nsincerely wish them every success.  What I mean  is  that\r\n\r\nworkers  must  start  to  think like  entrepreneurs  with\r\n\r\nregard to their employment and employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurs work hard to build up a successful\r\n\r\nbusiness model that will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprofitable for a long time. Workers too need to work hard\r\n\r\nto build up their knowledge and skill sets that will keep\r\n\r\nthem employable for life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an entrepreneur finds that customers no longer\r\n\r\nbuy  his  product,  he  will improve  it,  or  switch  to\r\n\r\nsomething  else.  When a worker finds that his  skill  is\r\n\r\noutdated, he must do the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an entrepreneur meets a strong competitor who\r\n\r\nsells  at  a lower price, he may have to lower his  price\r\n\r\nfor  a while to protect his market share while he figures\r\n\r\nout a new strategy.  Workers too face cost competition in\r\n\r\nthe  global labour market, and need to adjust their  wage\r\n\r\nexpectations  from  time  to time  to  avoid  losing  out\r\n\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one difference. Entrepreneurs must dare to\r\n\r\ntake risks, but workers are less able to take risks.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  in the new era of rapid changes in our global  and\r\n\r\ndomestic  economies, workers need stronger social  safety\r\n\r\nnets that will cushion them more effectively from adverse\r\n\r\noutcomes.   This  is  a subject my NTUC  colleagues  have\r\n\r\ndealt with in the Budget debate and will continue to take\r\n\r\nup in the Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our entrepreneurs, investors, managers, workers and\r\n\r\npublic officials are integral and interlinked communities\r\n\r\nin  the same national economy. The changes that come  our\r\n\r\nway affect us one and all.  Our response must be cohesive\r\n\r\nand  concerted.   The  title of the ERC  report  is  \"New\r\n\r\nChallenges, Fresh Goals - Towards a Dynamic Global City\".\r\n\r\nWe  have many long-term and immediate problems to  solve.\r\n\r\nLet  us together embrace the challenges, take aim at  the\r\n\r\nfresh  goals,  and  boldly implement the  recommendations\r\n\r\nthat will take us towards the dynamic global city that is\r\n\r\nour vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\ngrateful  for  this opportunity to join  in  the  debate.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a watershed debate on our economic future.   We\r\n\r\ncan tell our grandchildren, I am sure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  pride,  that  we were here when the  House  changed\r\n\r\ntheir future for the better.  Now at the tail-end of  the\r\n\r\ndebate,  most  of  what needs to be said,  my  many  hon.\r\n\r\ncolleagues have eloquently said them many times over.   I\r\n\r\nwould thus keep my comments brief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent to remember that while we are in\r\n\r\npain,  we  are in the midst of a global economic downturn\r\n\r\nwhich many in the region and elsewhere are suffering even\r\n\r\nmore.   In comparison, we are certainly not doing  badly.\r\n\r\nMany  people elsewhere would gladly exchange  place  with\r\n\r\nus.   In  a global network world, we would be daydreaming\r\n\r\nto  believe  that  we can shut ourselves completely  from\r\n\r\nglobal changes and events.  Let us recognise that we  are\r\n\r\nentering  an era of constant change.  Let us accept  this\r\n\r\nand adapt ourselves to this new world.  Major changes are\r\n\r\nneeded.   However,  in making the changes,  we  must  not\r\n\r\nmistake   our   short-term  needs   for   our   long-term\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee had done a good job.\r\n\r\nThey had proposed good recommendations, many of which the\r\n\r\nGovernment has accepted.  But, on a more basic issue,  do\r\n\r\nwe  need the ERC to achieve this in the first place?  Why\r\n\r\ndid  we  wait  until  the  current  economic  crisis   to\r\n\r\nconstitute  the ERC to do a comprehensive review  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy   and   for   the  Government   to   accept   its\r\n\r\nrecommendations?  Did we not have a planning  culture  in\r\n\r\nthe  first place?  Did the world suddenly change that  we\r\n\r\ncould not see it coming until it was upon us?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Dr Wang Kai Yuen had also asked this\r\n\r\nquestion  in another form.  According to Senior  Minister\r\n\r\nof  State, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, the recommendations were not\r\n\r\nall  new.   Many were proposed before, but  for  whatever\r\n\r\nreason, we did not adopt them until now.  So what was the\r\n\r\nmain contribution of the ERC?  It must be the ability  to\r\n\r\nget  the Government to accept its recommendations.  Thus,\r\n\r\nwas  the  Government  lulled into  complacency  like  the\r\n\r\nproverbial  frog  in  the pot over  the  fire?   Did  the\r\n\r\ncurrent   crisis   shock  us  out  of  our   stupor   and\r\n\r\ncomplacency?   If  it  did,  the  economic   crisis   was\r\n\r\ncertainly a blessing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  disguise.  We were lucky that we had time to get  out\r\n\r\nbefore  the pot boils.  This is a very important question\r\n\r\nfor our world has changed.  Can we continue to depend  on\r\n\r\nthis same planning approach that had worked well for  us?\r\n\r\nIf  we believe that constant change would govern the  new\r\n\r\nworld,  then our planning paradigm must change.  We  must\r\n\r\nconstantly  review  our  planning  parameters   for   the\r\n\r\nrelevant and be bold enough to make continual changes pro-actively, to remain competitive and relevant.  Again,  Dr\r\n\r\nWang had alluded to this in his speech yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not wait for something cataclysmic to happen\r\n\r\nagain  before we see the need or build up the resolve  to\r\n\r\nchange.   The next crisis may happen so quickly  that  we\r\n\r\nmay not have the luxury of time to constitute a committee\r\n\r\nto make the necessary recommendations for change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same can be said of our people. If we were to\r\n\r\ngo  by the anecdotes of how some people responded to  the\r\n\r\ndifficult  economic situation, it would  appear  that  we\r\n\r\nwere  also like the proverbial frog.  Some of the reasons\r\n\r\nthey gave for not taking up jobs offered to them include:\r\n\r\nthe  workplace was too far; the job was too tough;  never\r\n\r\ndid  this  type of jobs before; too old; too  bothersome;\r\n\r\ncannot  learn new things; wait for the old jobs  to  come\r\n\r\nback, or do not like to serve others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that our people learn fast.\r\n\r\nSeveral residents who came to see me during the MPS  with\r\n\r\nthese reasons have moved on to learn new skills and  take\r\n\r\non new jobs when they realised that the old jobs were not\r\n\r\ncoming back.  I agree with Mr Khaw Boon Wan again when he\r\n\r\nsaid  on  Monday that proposals and recommendations  were\r\n\r\neasier  to promulgate than to implement.  However,  I  am\r\n\r\nhopeful  that  our people will face up to the  challenges\r\n\r\nthat  confront  us.  We must adopt an  open  and  dynamic\r\n\r\nmindset with the world as our market - the willingness to\r\n\r\nlearn  and  relearn by recognising that our knowledge  is\r\n\r\ntime-dated, the willingness to take risk and to  try  new\r\n\r\nthings,  to  take on new jobs and to accept failures  and\r\n\r\ntry again - among other qualities.  I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhope  that this open, flexible, daring mindset will  take\r\n\r\nhold  to become part of our national psyche.  If this  is\r\n\r\nachieved, then the price paid for the pain that we had to\r\n\r\nendure to meet this change would have been worthwhile  as\r\n\r\nit would have prepared our people for the new world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one final point, Sir. In our earnestness to\r\n\r\nchange,  we  appear  to  have  downgraded  loyalty.    No\r\n\r\norganisation   could  survive  for  long  without   loyal\r\n\r\nmembers.    Loyalty  is  a  virtue.   Loyal,  hardworking\r\n\r\nworkers  are  a  competitive  advantage.   Loyalty  is  a\r\n\r\nculture  that  takes  years to  ingrain,  but  if  it  is\r\n\r\ncarelessly handled and abused, it can easily and  quickly\r\n\r\ndie.  Loyalty should thus not be given short shrift as we\r\n\r\novercome  our  short-term problems.  If we  do  so,  this\r\n\r\nshortsightedness will come back to haunt us in  the  days\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, it is less difficult to plan and\r\n\r\nbudget  than  to  carry  it out.   The  success  of  this\r\n\r\ntransition depends on us, the Singaporeans.  Let us  take\r\n\r\nthe  painful  lessons learned and move  forward  together\r\n\r\ninto  a  challenging  future.  We can  overcome;  we  can\r\n\r\nsucceed.   We  will overcome; we will  succeed.   Let  us\r\n\r\nquickly adapt and adjust to the new future by making  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  changes to meet the new conditions.   We  must\r\n\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, Sir, I express my support for\r\n\r\nthe motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

To  illustrate my  point,  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity does not want the Government to interfere  with\r\n\r\nbusiness,  but urges Government funding and  facilitation\r\n\r\nthat  will bring the civil service back into the business\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Our people have been asked to be self-reliant\r\n\r\nbut,  at  the same time, goodies would be welcome.   Many\r\n\r\nhave  also called for pump priming of the economy but  as\r\n\r\nour  colleague,  Mr  Khaw Boon Wan, said,  we  should  be\r\n\r\nfrugal.   Are we experiencing a schizophrenic  existence,\r\n\r\nas my colleague in this House, Mr Iswaran, has put it, or\r\n\r\nare  we  confused?  Or is it a case of kiasuism at  work,\r\n\r\nwhere we want all of the best and none of the worst?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the case may be, these sentiments, in\r\n\r\nuncertain  times, are perhaps the necessary catalyst  for\r\n\r\nchange.   Perhaps it is chaos before order.   It  is  the\r\n\r\ncatalyst that allows us to take the bull by its horns, to\r\n\r\nmake  fundamental policy shifts and even explain  \"labour\r\n\r\npains\",  to  restructure  our  economy  and  remake   our\r\n\r\nsociety.  Singaporeans are resilient.  We are capable  of\r\n\r\nrising to the challenge and bringing us to the next level\r\n\r\nof growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last election, amidst recessionary times,\r\n\r\nthe  ruling party had asked for a strong mandate in order\r\n\r\nto  carry  out  the  necessary, though painful,  task  of\r\n\r\nchange.   Let us not forget that while our people  showed\r\n\r\ntheir   support,  their  expectations  have  also   risen\r\n\r\naccordingly.  We have a duty to our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We promised jobs in our last election. It is\r\n\r\nevident that even in the midst of long-term planning, the\r\n\r\nGovernment did\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot forget that. It has done a great deal in the last one-and-a-half  years  since election, to  augment  both  the\r\n\r\nsupply and demand sides of labour, in a bid to align  the\r\n\r\ndifferences created by the advent of technology, as  well\r\n\r\nas   economic   restructuring,  to   higher   value-added\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and service industries.  But have  we  done\r\n\r\nenough?   Is our plan bold enough?  I believe we  can  be\r\n\r\nbolder   and  not  tiptoe  this  golden  opportunity   to\r\n\r\neffectively  deal with our economy and seal our  people's\r\n\r\nemotions to this land.  My colleagues have dealt in  both\r\n\r\nlength  and breadth about possible bold measures,  and  I\r\n\r\nwould like to focus on achieving the greater buy-ins from\r\n\r\nour  3Ps   -   the people, private and public sectors   - and the CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the people sector. As I listened to the\r\n\r\nBudget Statement that has been shaped to embrace most  of\r\n\r\nthe ERC recommendations, right at the back of my mind  is\r\n\r\nhow do we fire up the imagination of Singaporeans to have\r\n\r\na sense of mission to embrace these changes?  What is the\r\n\r\nmental  picture of Singapore in the year 2010 and beyond?\r\n\r\nDo  the  people on the ground really understand  the  ERC\r\n\r\nReport?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the Straits Times article on 1st March\r\n\r\n2003 written by Mr Tan Tarn How entitled, \"A dose of mild\r\n\r\nmedicine for economy in transition\".  In the article,  he\r\n\r\nsurmised  the  lack  of psychological dimension  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  this  Budget.  I acknowledge  that.   No  new\r\n\r\n\"goodies\"   -   yes, that is true, but  the  Budget  does\r\n\r\nextend  existing  goodies, like the S&C  charges,  rental\r\n\r\nrebates, and so on, to help Singaporeans tide over  these\r\n\r\ndifficult times.  A little help here and there  would  be\r\n\r\nheartwarming,  but  we must avoid fashioning  the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  into  an annual \"goodie bag\" or,  worse,  even\r\n\r\nlucky  draws,  as  some  benefits  would  only  apply  to\r\n\r\nspecific   segments  of  the  population.    That   would\r\n\r\ncertainly not cultivate the right spirit and attitude  of\r\n\r\nthe  nation.  But the call for a psychological  dimension\r\n\r\nis  an  important  one.  It is a call for  the  alignment\r\n\r\nbetween  the leadership and the people, so as to  achieve\r\n\r\naccelerated  growth.   We must  see  our  people  not  as\r\n\r\nfunctional economic units of production\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbut  as meaningful value contributors.  Henry Ford was  a\r\n\r\ngem  at  mass  production but could not  have  been  more\r\n\r\nmistaken when he asked, \"Why is it that I always get  the\r\n\r\nwhole person when what I really want is a pair of hands?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to understand that in this knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy where changes are happening everywhere, fast  and\r\n\r\nfurious,  the  sense of anomie may  be heightened  if  we\r\n\r\nlose  track  of our case.  People work for a living,  but\r\n\r\nlive  for a cause.  And it is in this process of  working\r\n\r\ntowards  the  cause  that  establishes  Singapore's   and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans' modus operandi and identity.  If we are  in\r\n\r\na  branding exercise, this exercise will have to start at\r\n\r\nhome,  and  not  just  with IE  Singapore.   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  agencies involved in this \"branding\"  exercise,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  new institution for continuing  education\r\n\r\nand  training,  will focus on firing up  the  passion  in\r\n\r\nevery person, rather than impart mere technical skills to\r\n\r\nmechanically \"retrofit\" people for jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructuring means uncertainty; it means change,\r\n\r\nand   sometimes  pain.   It  is  traumatic  for   workers\r\n\r\naccustomed  to  a  full  employment  situation  to   find\r\n\r\nthemselves, firstly, being retrenched; secondly, asked to\r\n\r\ngo  for retraining  -  sometimes in an alien field;  and,\r\n\r\nthirdly, to realise the call to be self-employed contract\r\n\r\nworkers and embrace entrepreneurship, preferably  of  the\r\n\r\nhigh value-added type.  To many, this seems like a triple\r\n\r\nwhammy!   Many workers have neither the skills,  resource\r\n\r\nnor  mindset to do so.  Sir, to lessen the shock and pain\r\n\r\nfelt by some of our workers, I advocate the setting up of\r\n\r\na  proper  job  transition  mechanism  using  a  holistic\r\n\r\napproach.  Perhaps under the new CET Institute to be  set\r\n\r\nup under the Ministry of Manpower, retrenched workers can\r\n\r\nreceive advice and counselling that is beyond simple  job\r\n\r\nmatching.  We can assist displaced workers by a four-step\r\n\r\nprocess:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, give them emotional counselling, so that they\r\n\r\nare better able to absorb the retrenchment news;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, give them financial counselling, so that\r\n\r\nthey can better manage their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nliving  expenses  and  better deploy  their  retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, retrain them or job match them, so that they\r\n\r\ncan have a meaningful placement; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, for those who desire to venture into\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship,  they  could  be   redirected   to   an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship agency, so that they can learn to better\r\n\r\nassess and manage their risk.  Mentorship programmes  can\r\n\r\nbe   encouraged   and   access  to   business   networks,\r\n\r\nopportunities   and   infrastructure   could   also    be\r\n\r\nfacilitated  indiscriminately.  In other  words,  whether\r\n\r\nthe  entrepreneurial activity is in the  low-tech,  high-tech  or no-tech industry, the desired outcome is to  get\r\n\r\nour people to adopt a different mindset  -  a mindset  to\r\n\r\ncarve  out a niche for themselves to stay nimble  and  be\r\n\r\nself-reliant, a mindset to embrace risk as part of  their\r\n\r\ndaily staple.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CPF. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the policy on\r\n\r\nthe  temporary freeze on CPF restoration for  two  years.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I hope that employers who are doing  well  will\r\n\r\nreward  their  employees and put back some of  these  CPF\r\n\r\nreductions to their salary either in the form of  monthly\r\n\r\nvariable  component  or even yearly  bonus.   This  would\r\n\r\naugur  well for long-term employer/employee relationship.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the civil service may want to lead by example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF scheme is a sacred cow not to be\r\n\r\nslaughtered.   Started  in 1955 as  a  simple  retirement\r\n\r\nsavings  scheme,  it  is  a scheme  that  encourages  the\r\n\r\nvirtues  of  work and thrift, and saving for rainy  days.\r\n\r\nThe   scheme's   sole  purpose  was   that   of   nestegg\r\n\r\naccumulation,  so  that members can be self-reliant  when\r\n\r\ntheir  income stops.  Today, the CPF scheme  has  evolved\r\n\r\ninto  a  multi-layer and multi-purpose scheme  which  not\r\n\r\nonly confuses some, but no longer a reliable nestegg  for\r\n\r\nmany.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In good financial planning practice, it is important\r\n\r\nto   earmark  specific  resource  for  a  specific  goal.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  the  multi-use of a  resource  with  separate\r\n\r\ngoals  can lead to conflict, confusion and an intertwined\r\n\r\nweb of different objectives.  Sir, a slave of many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmasters faces multiple duties, obligations and functional\r\n\r\nwoes.   This, to me, appears to be the dilemma  faced  by\r\n\r\nour  CPF  scheme.  Over the years, this simple compulsory\r\n\r\nsavings  scheme  has  come to mean  different  things  to\r\n\r\ndifferent  people.   As much as it  is  a  life-line  for\r\n\r\nretirees, home owners and investors, it is also a  source\r\n\r\nof   lifeblood   for   some   of   Singapore's   economic\r\n\r\ninitiatives.   This  is evident in industries  where  CPF\r\n\r\nfunds   can   be  channelled  into.   Clearly,   in   the\r\n\r\nresidential property market and, to a lesser extent,  the\r\n\r\nfinancial market, each relaxation of the CPF rules,  from\r\n\r\n1980s to 1990s, to allow for more funds released into the\r\n\r\nrespective industry, never fails to fuel the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Department of Statistics, $119\r\n\r\nbillion  was poured into housing over the last  10  years\r\n\r\nwhile  $12.5 billion was withdrawn from CPF in  the  year\r\n\r\n2000.   And where did it go?  Into housing.  If  this  is\r\n\r\nnot evident enough of our obsession with property, a 2001\r\n\r\npaper by the Wharton-SMU Research Centre showed that  the\r\n\r\naverage  Singaporean has 75% of his  assets  locked  into\r\n\r\nhousing, compared with 20% in the USA.  What then is left\r\n\r\nfor  retirement?  Answer:  a big house, small  cash,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  arrears in payment.  Perhaps the Government  can\r\n\r\nset up a study group to examine ways to help Singaporeans\r\n\r\nunlock  the  value of their property to  encourage  self-sufficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of property, but perhaps to a lesser\r\n\r\nextent,  the  financial  market  boomed  as  millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars  were  poured  into  the  CPF-approved  financial\r\n\r\ninstruments.  All these would have been good news, except\r\n\r\nthat  the  starry eyes that went in came out tearing,  as\r\n\r\nthe  volatility in these investments proved too  much  to\r\n\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequence of such a development, if unchecked,\r\n\r\nwill result in an urgent call for a bigger provision  for\r\n\r\nsocial   security   measures,  either   through   forward\r\n\r\nfinancing   -  meaning we have got to pay more tax  today\r\n\r\n-  or  a burden on the next generation of taxpayers,  and\r\n\r\nmore deficit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbudgeting   in  the  years  to  come.   All   these   are\r\n\r\nundesirable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the alternative? I think the move by the\r\n\r\nGovernment to relook and realign the CPF scheme is a wise\r\n\r\none,  but  one  which needs to be done at an  accelerated\r\n\r\npace and more decisively.  I have four basic suggestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the retirement fund. CPF should stay true\r\n\r\nto  its original objective of providing a nestegg for its\r\n\r\nmembers.  This should remain the primary and single  most\r\n\r\nimportant  objective.  In the original scheme of  things,\r\n\r\nassuming  that an average couple earns an average  annual\r\n\r\nincome  of  $50,000 per year, and works for 35 years,  at\r\n\r\nthe  original  contribution rate of 40% and  an  interest\r\n\r\nrate  of  2.5%  per annum, they would have accumulated  a\r\n\r\nnestegg  of more than $1 million in their CPF.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, almost every other Singaporean household could  be\r\n\r\na millionaire household when they retire!  But this could\r\n\r\nbe  history.   With CPF funds pouring into  property  and\r\n\r\nhalf-understood  investments, it was reported  that  most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans would not even be able to meet  the  Minimum\r\n\r\nSum  when they retire.  Therefore, bolder steps  to  move\r\n\r\ncash into the retirement account should be advocated with\r\n\r\nurgency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special and Retirement Accounts' interest rate\r\n\r\nof  4%  per  annum  is highly attractive  and,  in  fact,\r\n\r\ngenerous in such times.  Could the Government use this as\r\n\r\nan   incentive  to  incentivise  members  to  voluntarily\r\n\r\ncontribute additional funds in the above accounts?  Could\r\n\r\ncash also be accepted?  Could there be further tax relief\r\n\r\nfor  those  who bite?  Obviously, members would  have  to\r\n\r\nreckon  that  such voluntary contributions  can  only  be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn  at retirement age.  The current recommendation\r\n\r\nof  a moderate increase to the retirement account is  too\r\n\r\nlittle, too late.  This could be a one-time exercise or a\r\n\r\nlong-term  strategy  if  the Government  can  afford  it.\r\n\r\nUltimately,  it  is either we encourage  self-funding  or\r\n\r\nstate funding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on investment account. Investment via the\r\n\r\nCPF scheme should be properly missioned and managed.   It\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  nestegg and should be treated as such.  While there is\r\n\r\nnothing   wrong  with  advocating  self-investment,   the\r\n\r\nassumption  must be that all CPF members  comprehend  the\r\n\r\nprinciples  and  tools  of investment.   But  is  this  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  assumption?   I  do  not  think   so.    Most\r\n\r\ninvestors who make use of the CPFIS are, in fact,  first-time  investors.  Like fire, this resource is  useful  to\r\n\r\nthose  who know its risk and learn how to use  it.   Like\r\n\r\nfire,  it  is  dangerous and damaging to  those  who  are\r\n\r\nignorant.  Many CPF members saw it not so much as  a  way\r\n\r\nto  grow their nestegg, but a way to make some money  and\r\n\r\ncash  out  immediately from the profits.  Alas, the  fire\r\n\r\nproved  too  hot for handling and many got their  nestegg\r\n\r\nburnt.   They  got barbecued egg in burnt  nest  instead.\r\n\r\nWhile  some  may be wiser after losing their money,  many\r\n\r\nremain  confused and put the blame on CPF or friends  who\r\n\r\nhave  advocated the investment.  We need to  do  more  to\r\n\r\nhelp  Singaporeans  wise  up in the  world  of  financial\r\n\r\nmanagement.  It is not rocket science, but it is  no  ABC\r\n\r\neither.  I have advocated many times in this House,  that\r\n\r\nfinancial literacy should be made a priority to  increase\r\n\r\nthe  financial quotient (or FQ) of Singaporeans, so  that\r\n\r\nwe  can  cope  with the ever complex world of investment,\r\n\r\nand the urgency of retirement funding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me move on to the home purchase fund. The\r\n\r\nCPF  Board  also  calls the CPF scheme a `home  ownership\r\n\r\nfund'.   But is this really so?  Upon closer examination,\r\n\r\nit  looks definitely more like a `house purchase fund' or\r\n\r\na   `property   purchase  fund'.   Let  me  explain   the\r\n\r\ndifference.  While a home purchase fund would focus  more\r\n\r\non  the  roof  over  the head for a  household,  a  house\r\n\r\npurchase  fund  works  like a property  investment  fund,\r\n\r\nwhere a basic roof is not the purpose, but the profit  of\r\n\r\nthe purchase becomes the primary objective.  This is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  the single most important fuel that fired  up  the\r\n\r\nproperty  boom up until 15th May 1996, when  the  capital\r\n\r\ngains tax was imposed on property purchase.  This is  one\r\n\r\nway  to  place greater restraint on fund use.  CPF  as  a\r\n\r\n`home  purchase  fund\" is fine; but as a `house  purchase\r\n\r\nfund' or a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproperty  investment fund, there will be no  end  to  the\r\n\r\nproperty chase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on the Medisave fund. In the past, emperors\r\n\r\nand  sages  feared living too short a life.  Today,  many\r\n\r\npeople  fear  living too long.  The concerns  of  healthy\r\n\r\nliving  and  illness  funding are frequently  heard.   In\r\n\r\nfact, market talk has it that it is better to die than to\r\n\r\nfall sick in Singapore, due to high medical cost, amongst\r\n\r\nother  things.  Hence, I applaud the Government's helping\r\n\r\nhand  in introducing and encouraging various medical  and\r\n\r\nlong-term care schemes like ElderShield, MediShield  and,\r\n\r\nmost  recently,  the  portable medical  benefit  schemes.\r\n\r\nKnowing  full well that there can only be limited success\r\n\r\nif  left  to  market  forces of demand  and  supply,  the\r\n\r\ndecision to make premiums payable via the Medisave scheme\r\n\r\nis  a  brilliant move.  But more can be  done.   Here,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to support Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's call to  widen\r\n\r\nthe  scheme.  But in addition to the suggestions  he  has\r\n\r\nmade,  I  have also been told that many Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\ncontracting one form of critical illness or another at  a\r\n\r\nyounger  and  younger  age.  As  such,  critical  illness\r\n\r\ninsurance  premium is indeed amongst the  most  expensive\r\n\r\nforms  of  insurance, and it could be argued as  probably\r\n\r\none  of  the  most  important forms of  insurance.   Why?\r\n\r\nBecause  people do not necessarily die from  it,  but  it\r\n\r\nwill  certainly make them a lot poorer.  Critical illness\r\n\r\ndoes not work the same way as medical benefits which  are\r\n\r\nindemnity schemes.  Critical illness policies pay a  lump\r\n\r\nsum  upon  diagnosis  of a critical  illness.   Hence,  I\r\n\r\npropose that the Government seriously consider setting up\r\n\r\na  national  critical  illness cover  or  allow  critical\r\n\r\nillness policies to be purchased via the Medisave.   This\r\n\r\nway,  the drawdown on a person's limited resources  could\r\n\r\nbe better managed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, after we have talked about the people sector,\r\n\r\nI  would like to move on to the private sector.  Perhaps,\r\n\r\nin my opinion, the single biggest group that will benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  this  Budget is the SMEs.  The Budget is consistent\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government's effort to proactively  develop  a\r\n\r\nhigher  level  of entrepreneurial activity in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps we should take a reality check\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  ask:  where  are  we now?  Over the  years,  various\r\n\r\ninternational  rating  agencies have  consistently  rated\r\n\r\nSingapore  highly for its infrastructure and pro-business\r\n\r\nenvironment.  Yet in the Global Entrepreneurship  Monitor\r\n\r\nReport  2001, published by the London School of  Business\r\n\r\nand  Babson College, Singapore was cited to be having one\r\n\r\nof the lowest rates of entrepreneurial activity in the 29\r\n\r\ncountries  surveyed.   There seems  to  be  a  disconnect\r\n\r\nsomewhere.   Have  we  created an  environment  where  it\r\n\r\nfavours  foreign investors and GLCs over local SMEs?   Or\r\n\r\nis it that the rewards of labour far outweigh the risk of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship?  In short, have we inadvertently become\r\n\r\na victim of our own success?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in any economy, there are\r\n\r\nessentially  four factors of production -  land,  labour,\r\n\r\ncapital  and  entrepreneurship.  In Singapore,  the  risk\r\n\r\nreward  ratios of these four factors are out of  balance.\r\n\r\nThe  rewards  for  land and labour far outweigh  that  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs,   thereby   creating   disincentives    to\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.   We  will  need  to   re-balance   the\r\n\r\nequation  to  make entrepreneurship an attractive  career\r\n\r\noption.   As  long as reward ratios are out  of  balance,\r\n\r\nthen  it  is going to be difficult and an uphill struggle\r\n\r\nfor  us to encourage entrepreneurship.  Access to capital\r\n\r\ncould  also  be  improved, especially for  start-ups  and\r\n\r\nthose in the emerging and expansionary phases of growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, businesses move to where\r\n\r\nthere are more business opportunities and where money can\r\n\r\nbe made.  Yes, Singapore does not have a hinterland as in\r\n\r\nthe case of Hong Kong and China, but our `hinterland'  is\r\n\r\nlocated  within the seven-hour flight radius, facilitated\r\n\r\nby  high-tech connections and the successful  Free  Trade\r\n\r\nAgreements  and  bilateral trade and business  agreements\r\n\r\nconcluded.  Thanks to the hard work and vision of MTI, we\r\n\r\nhave  cause for celebration, and opportunities  await  at\r\n\r\nour  doorstep.  It is now up to the Government to  spread\r\n\r\nthe  good  news,  and the entrepreneurs to  spread  their\r\n\r\nwings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the public sector. It is heartening to\r\n\r\nnote in the Finance Minister's Budget Statement that  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector  will continue to simplify its  rules  and\r\n\r\nprocedures and cut red tape.  However, it is not just the\r\n\r\nrules  and  red tape that need pruning, but the necessity\r\n\r\nto   urgently   cultivate  a  pro-business,  pro-customer\r\n\r\nservice  culture as we move forward.  Obviously, deciding\r\n\r\nto  transform is easy, but implementing it is  difficult.\r\n\r\nThe  policymakers may have the will but the civil service\r\n\r\nmust be prepared to `stick their necks out', stand on the\r\n\r\nside  of  business  to  understand the  desired  outcomes\r\n\r\nsought  by the policymakers, and not get trapped  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess of things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our civil service grows, the expanding midriff\r\n\r\nand   layering   distance  the  policymakers   from   the\r\n\r\ncustomers,  and  response time  could  be  slowed.   Many\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  ordinary folks have been  frustrated  with\r\n\r\nstandard   replies  and  follow-the-rule-book   attitude.\r\n\r\nPlaying it safe becomes the name of the game, as  no  one\r\n\r\nwants to be held accountable for their actions.  Hence, I\r\n\r\napplaud  the  setting up of the ministerial committee  on\r\n\r\nthe  service  industry, headed by Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nLee,  and  the  ministerial committee on entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nunder  Minister  of State Raymond Lim.  This  will  bring\r\n\r\nboth  decision makers closer to the ground, provided that\r\n\r\nthe structure is kept lean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past two days in this House, we have\r\n\r\nconsumed     western    medicine,    eastern    medicine,\r\n\r\npsychotherapy as well as physiotherapy.  Are we now ready\r\n\r\nto give birth?  Sir, I believe that when the mind speaks,\r\n\r\nthe  body  listens.   The challenge  is  whether  we  can\r\n\r\nconnect  our  mind  (which is our leaders)  to  our  body\r\n\r\n(which is our people), so that we can walk the talk as  a\r\n\r\nnation.  Our mind needs a loud and clear vision, so  that\r\n\r\nour  body  will align itself to the purpose.  Our  people\r\n\r\nneed a mental picture.  If I could pose this question  to\r\n\r\nour Finance Minister, if you have a piece of clean canvas\r\n\r\ntoday, what would be the picture that you would paint  on\r\n\r\nit?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no tradition in demonstrations, but we have\r\n\r\na good track record in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncampaigns,  which have helped built our nation.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  next few months, campaigns  depicting  our\r\n\r\nvisions and goals, best done in pictorial forms, could be\r\n\r\nlaunched  as  a marketing effort to align  our  mind  and\r\n\r\nbody.   Ultimately,  we do not want visions  embossed  on\r\n\r\npaper, but we want visions embodied in the daily lives of\r\n\r\nevery resident in Singapore.  Together, we stand; divided\r\n\r\nwe kang-kor, meaning we fall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is an old Chinese proverb\r\n\r\nthat  says  `we  cannot help the birds of sadness  flying\r\n\r\nover  our heads, but we need not let them build nests  in\r\n\r\nour hair'.  In fact, if we look beyond, there is a silver\r\n\r\nlining,  and  there  is blue sky.  We  have  a  lot  more\r\n\r\nsources and network than that of our forefathers who came\r\n\r\nfrom  afar.   As we stand at the crossroad of  our  third\r\n\r\nphase of growth, let us emulate the undying spirit of our\r\n\r\nfounding  fathers to be industrious, to be  frugal,  and,\r\n\r\nmost of all, to be hopeful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the release of the ERC Report, there has\r\n\r\nbeen  much  debate  on  the means through  which  we  can\r\n\r\nimprove  the  competitiveness of Singapore in  this  fast\r\n\r\nchanging  global economy.  We have talked  about  how  we\r\n\r\nshould  remake  Singapore,  and  have  drafted  plans  to\r\n\r\nrestructure  our  economy, to make our  education  system\r\n\r\nmore  responsive  to the demands of the  economy  and  to\r\n\r\ninnovate in ways that will sustain development and wealth\r\n\r\ngeneration for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we have seen some of these imperatives of\r\n\r\neconomic  restructuring being put in place  through  last\r\n\r\nyear's  Budget.  And in this year's Budget, delivered  on\r\n\r\n28th  February by the Minister for Finance, we  see  more\r\n\r\ninitiatives, vital to our survival, which are recommended\r\n\r\nby the ERC, being implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, aside from the wealth of quality ideas from the\r\n\r\nvarious stakeholders from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nall   quarters,  an  able  Government  and  a  dependable\r\n\r\ninfrastructure to execute the well-crafted  grand  plans,\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore must play their part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic slowdown and the threat of terrorism\r\n\r\nhave  cast a gloom on our people.  It has put an  austere\r\n\r\nmood  over many a Singaporean.  While it is a good  thing\r\n\r\nto  be austere and to revere the virtues of frugality, as\r\n\r\nSenior Minister of State, Mr Khaw, spoke about yesterday,\r\n\r\nin  such times, the flip side is a dip in our morale.   I\r\n\r\nwant  to  speak on the ways in which we can  improve  the\r\n\r\nmorale of Singaporeans in these hard times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to quickly adopt a double-barrel approach.\r\n\r\nWe  already have one barrel pinned down quite  well,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the  ERC's recommendations are refreshing  and\r\n\r\nhold promise.  I would like to make some comments on  the\r\n\r\npractical  examples of the forward-looking  character  of\r\n\r\nour growth strategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has taken further initiatives in the field\r\n\r\nof  wealth  management.  These build on those initiatives\r\n\r\nannounced last year.  Singapore recognises that  we  need\r\n\r\nto  position ourselves to provide these kinds  of  wealth\r\n\r\nmanagement services to successful families.  Singapore is\r\n\r\nwell  suited  to deliver such services at a  high  level.\r\n\r\nThere is competition, but the competitors do not have the\r\n\r\nadvantages that Singapore has.  Among the advantages  are\r\n\r\nour sound banking and financial regulatory system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, too much of the wealth management service\r\n\r\nindustry,  undertaken globally, is shrouded  in  secrecy.\r\n\r\nThere  is already a drive for change as advocated by  the\r\n\r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and\r\n\r\nother  financial sector watchdogs.  Singapore must  be  a\r\n\r\nfirst  mover.  There is an opportunity to take  advantage\r\n\r\nof  a significant shift in an industry that will learn to\r\n\r\ndepend on service levels and confidentiality, rather than\r\n\r\non   secrecy.   Singapore  is  uniquely  placed  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  this opportunity.  We have developed  into\r\n\r\none of the top tier financial services\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncentres  in  Asia.  The infrastructure  is  basically  in\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pre-empt or address any concerns on the standards\r\n\r\napplied in Singapore, we must put a supervisory framework\r\n\r\nin  place.   Some Members have, over the last  two  days,\r\n\r\ntalked   about  the  Singapore  brand.   The  supervisory\r\n\r\nframework  will  safeguard our  reputation  as  a  Wealth\r\n\r\nManagement  Centre Par Excellence.  This  framework  will\r\n\r\nrespect the confidentiality of the clients of the service\r\n\r\nproviders  while  ensuring that those  service  providers\r\n\r\nfully  understand their clients, and the source of  funds\r\n\r\nbeing managed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is noted, among financial watchdogs, for\r\n\r\ntaking a tough stand in areas of money-laundering.   This\r\n\r\nreputation will be a plus to develop Singapore  to  be  a\r\n\r\npre-eminent financial centre.  This supervision  is  best\r\n\r\ndone  by  way  of  a  cooperative  effort  and  could  be\r\n\r\nspearheaded  by  the  MAS.  Respect  for  confidentiality\r\n\r\nmight  also  lead  to  a desire to enact  provisions  for\r\n\r\ntrusts  that  mirror those of banking information.   That\r\n\r\nwould  further  demonstrate our  seriousness  with  which\r\n\r\nSingapore   banks,   financial  and   wealth   management\r\n\r\ninstitutions treat their clients' information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current changes to the trust provisions, which\r\n\r\nwere announced in the most recent Budget, clarify certain\r\n\r\nareas  so  that one avoids ambiguity.  In fact, something\r\n\r\nof  a  non-NUTS  approach  is evident  in  the  ERC.   An\r\n\r\nexclusion  list  of what cannot be done is  proposed  and\r\n\r\nanything  outside that list is a green light.  This  will\r\n\r\nspur  the  creative and innovative culture we  have  been\r\n\r\nlamenting  that  is so lacking or subdued.   The  current\r\n\r\nchanges  have  also  expanded  the  availability  of  the\r\n\r\nbenefits to foreign trusts managed by all trust companies\r\n\r\nin Singapore, details of which can be found in the Budget\r\n\r\nStatement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister mentioned, one other component that\r\n\r\nwill  be  put in place soon is the review of legislation.\r\n\r\nThis  will bring the statutes current.  This was recently\r\n\r\ndone in relation to the companies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlegislation.    Now  it  is  the  turn   of   the   trust\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to create an environment where the fiduciary\r\n\r\nservice  providers want to locate to Singapore.  This  is\r\n\r\nhigh value work.  We will see the concept of clusters  at\r\n\r\nwork  here.  Significantly, ancillary services would flow\r\n\r\nfrom  the  development of wealth management  services  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Legal services, banking services,  financial\r\n\r\nmanagement,  financial planning and private  banking  are\r\n\r\nall  services  that  depend heavily  on  the  skills  and\r\n\r\nabilities of the persons supplying these services.  These\r\n\r\nservices are skill-intensive and require a high level  of\r\n\r\nunderstanding and some experience.  We will see a  magnet\r\n\r\nfor  talent flow from this.  In addition, the information\r\n\r\ntechnology  requirements are very sophisticated  and  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  information  systems  can   provide   an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  service  the industry  worldwide.   Best\r\n\r\npractices  are  evolving  in  this  area  as  well.    An\r\n\r\nopportunity exists here.  Skilful and hardworking  people\r\n\r\nare  providing  conscientious service to global  clients.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  recipe  for  success that  augurs  well  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's plan to be a pre-eminent financial centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke of taking a double-barrel approach. It is\r\n\r\nclear  from my elaboration of the wealth management area,\r\n\r\naddressed  by  the  ERC, that we have  one  barrel  fully\r\n\r\nloaded and armed.  Let us consider the other barrel.  The\r\n\r\nother barrel should be loaded with a call to Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  rise  to the challenge we face.  Government  leaders,\r\n\r\nwhile  persisting  in  encouraging changing  mindsets  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, must also continue to reassure Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat we will have our day in the sun.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just like in banking, when a client's\r\n\r\ninvestment  portfolio  is down  as  a  result  of  market\r\n\r\naction,  bankers will, along with working out strategies,\r\n\r\nalso  handhold their clients through a difficult  period.\r\n\r\nIn  so doing, it will allow continued focus on the longer\r\n\r\nterm  investment  objectives and  avoid  hasty  knee-jerk\r\n\r\nreactions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we want individuals to be more self-reliant, we must ensure that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfighting spirit of Singaporeans cannot and must not wane.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  cannot be pessimistic.  We cannot  let  our\r\n\r\nenergies ebb.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have to recognise whatever creative\r\n\r\neffort  and  energy that are present in us, and  draw  on\r\n\r\nthem.   We  cannot lose the sense of urgency to move  on.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must  see  this.  I  think  in  this  area,\r\n\r\nGovernment leaders must do more cheer leading along  with\r\n\r\ntheir  grand plans.  Without a high morale, we will  find\r\n\r\nourselves  at the bottom of the cliff and without  voice.\r\n\r\nThen, we cannot say we have a great this or a great that,\r\n\r\nor we are ranked this or that, or how clean and green our\r\n\r\ncity  is.  For we will no longer be any of these,  but  a\r\n\r\nnation of pessimists doomed to fail.  Investors will  not\r\n\r\ncome  to our shores and people will leave once the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore lose their drive and desire to succeed, most\r\n\r\nof all, the guts to try and try again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the morale of our people must be high. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has the leadership quality, the  resolve  and\r\n\r\nexperience  to  tip  the  morale  scales  in  Singapore's\r\n\r\nfavour.   The  ERC Report is just one of the avenues,  or\r\n\r\ntool kits, to address and pre-empt the challenges we  are\r\n\r\nfacing  and  will  encounter in the near and  foreseeable\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has always been upfront and direct\r\n\r\nabout  the  problems  we have.  We acknowledge  what  and\r\n\r\nwhere  the  problems are.  In this respect,  we  need  to\r\n\r\nreassure  Singaporeans that we will ride  the  challenges\r\n\r\nand  come out with our heads high, just as we did in  the\r\n\r\n1970s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was encouraged and felt a sense of pride as I read\r\n\r\nin  the Sunday Times' report on the four Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nventured  to India.  Their indomitable spirit to  succeed\r\n\r\nand try something new came through clearly.  Sir, we need\r\n\r\nto  hear  and  see more of such instances of  a  fighting\r\n\r\nspirit.   We  need to celebrate and give  cheer  to  such\r\n\r\ninstances of entrepreneurship and pioneering spirit.   As\r\n\r\nour  Prime  Minister so succinctly put  it  -  we  should\r\n\r\nphilosophise and see how things are not all bad.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the Finns and see how they dealt with\r\n\r\na  dramatic  upheaval in their economic environment.   Up\r\n\r\nuntil  the  early  1990s, Finland had been  part  of  the\r\n\r\nEastern  bloc  and went unnoticed in the global  economy.\r\n\r\nWith  the collapse of the Soviet Union, Finland's economy\r\n\r\nunderwent a major transformation.  Practically overnight,\r\n\r\nit  lost  a  quarter  of its major export  market.   This\r\n\r\nresulted in massive unemployment in many sectors  of  the\r\n\r\nFinnish   economy.    However,  despite   this   economic\r\n\r\nhardship,  the  Finnish  people  did  not  despair.   The\r\n\r\nFinnish  Parliament  agreed that  its  government  should\r\n\r\ninvest   heavily   in  education  and  research.    These\r\n\r\ninvestments paid off.  Today, 10 years after the  crisis,\r\n\r\nFinland   is   the  world's  most  competitive   economy,\r\n\r\naccording  to  a  ranking by the  World  Economic  Forum.\r\n\r\nAverage economic growth since 1994 has been 5%, and  this\r\n\r\nis significant for an industrialised country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironic that it took a serious economic crisis\r\n\r\nfor  Finland  to  realise  its potential.   We  have  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of a strong open market economy that has stood us\r\n\r\nin  good stead for many years.  But given the success  of\r\n\r\nprevious  years, Singaporeans were not prepared for  this\r\n\r\nsustained downturn.  It was a shock to the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Finns, Singaporeans need to be flexible,\r\n\r\ninnovative  and  turn  a  deep  adversity  into  a  grand\r\n\r\nchallenge.   Unity  of  purpose across  the  sectors  and\r\n\r\ninterests,  and  planning with perspective  even  in  the\r\n\r\nmidst  of a crisis are important.  Look at the Finns  and\r\n\r\nthe   remarkable   Nokia  their  people   have   created.\r\n\r\nSingapore is geared in the same way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to raise the morale of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nAs Mark Twain once said, \"There is nothing sadder than  a\r\n\r\nyoung  pessimist.\"   We  cannot  be  a  young  nation  of\r\n\r\npessimists,  if  what  the  ERC recommendations  and  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of such imperatives are anything to go by.\r\n\r\nThere   is  much  hope.   Yes,  we  are  facing   serious\r\n\r\nchallenges  in the economic downturn.  However,  we  must\r\n\r\nmake  all efforts to ensure that Singaporeans do not lose\r\n\r\nheart.  If that happens, then no amount of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nremaking will help us get to where we need to be  in  the\r\n\r\nNew Economy of a changed world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have the brains, we have the passion and the\r\n\r\nwill.   But we need to have a heart and the guts to  move\r\n\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the Budget Statement be proceeded\r\n\r\nwith  beyond  4.30  pm  and the  proceedings  thereon  be\r\n\r\nexempted  at  this day's sitting from the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nStanding Order No. 1. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br>3.42 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Budget is an\r\n\r\nimportant step forward in restructuring our economy.   It\r\n\r\nbuilds on the strategic shifts which we began last  year,\r\n\r\nespecially  the tax changes, the offset package  for  the\r\n\r\ntax   changes,  including  the  ERS  distributed  on  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary, and also the CPF changes.  So, as aptly  pointed\r\n\r\nout  by Ms Indranee Rajah and other MPs, the measures and\r\n\r\npolicies  in this Budget should be seen in that  context,\r\n\r\nand not in isolation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget will also have to be seen in the context\r\n\r\nof   the  current  global  outlook,  and  the  short-term\r\n\r\nprospects for the Singapore economy.  The global  outlook\r\n\r\nis  very  uncertain.  Much hinges on what will happen  in\r\n\r\nIraq.    The  whole  world  is  now  anxiously  following\r\n\r\ndevelopments at the UN Security Council, watching to  see\r\n\r\nif war breaks out over the next few days and, if there is\r\n\r\na war, how events develop and what happens afterwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One significant question is which way oil prices\r\n\r\nwill  move.   Oil prices are already very high,  both  in\r\n\r\nanticipation of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwar  disrupting  supplies and also  because  problems  in\r\n\r\nVenezuela  have already reduced supplies.   Analysts  are\r\n\r\nnot  optimistic  that oil prices will  fall  rapidly,  as\r\n\r\nhappened after the Gulf War in 1991.  If oil prices  stay\r\n\r\nhigh, it will dampen the global economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the US economy, the recent signs have been\r\n\r\nmixed.   The  consensus is still that  we  can  expect  a\r\n\r\nmodest  US  recovery in the second half of the  year  and\r\n\r\nthat,  as  a  whole, 2003 should be slightly better  than\r\n\r\n2002.   But this is not at all a sure thing.  Some  well-respected  analysts  are worried about  the  US  economy,\r\n\r\nparticularly  Steve Roach of Morgan Stanley.   They  fear\r\n\r\nthat  high oil prices, high consumer debt, deflation  and\r\n\r\nthe  lingering hangover of the burst dot-com bubble  will\r\n\r\nresult  in another US recession.  Since Europe and  Japan\r\n\r\nremain  weak, a US recession would leave the whole  world\r\n\r\nwithout any engine of growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still a minority view, but it is one that we\r\n\r\nhave to take seriously.  I met one experienced US analyst\r\n\r\nrecently and he told me that in more than 20 years he had\r\n\r\nnever  seen  a  time  like this,  where  people  were  so\r\n\r\nuncertain as to which way the US economy was heading  and\r\n\r\nmarket  analysts  were so divided in their  views.   And,\r\n\r\ntherefore, he was very worried.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these dark clouds on the horizon, right now,\r\n\r\nour own economy is still growing.  We had 2.2% GDP growth\r\n\r\nlast year and the unemployment rate improved somewhat  to\r\n\r\n4.2% at the end of the year, coming off from its peak  of\r\n\r\n4.6%.   So  far, this year, the signs have been positive.\r\n\r\nFor  January,  our non-oil domestic exports increased  by\r\n\r\n18%   year   on   year  and  our  industrial   production\r\n\r\nmanufacturing output also went up 14% year on year.   The\r\n\r\nearly  indications are that the first quarter GDP  growth\r\n\r\nis  quite  steady.  Our early estimate, based  mainly  on\r\n\r\nJanuary  data,  is plus 2.7%.  And this  is  despite  the\r\n\r\nmajor uncertainty of war hanging over the global economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I think Dr Wang Kai Yuen may have been a\r\n\r\nlittle bit too pessimistic when he said that the worst is\r\n\r\nyet to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncome.   But it is certainly possible that things can  get\r\n\r\nworse and we will need to monitor and assess developments\r\n\r\nclosely, and be prepared if this happens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main concern among many Singaporeans is jobs.\r\n\r\nMany  people  have  said this is a  pro-business  budget.\r\n\r\nBut,  as  Mdm  Halimah  Yacob and Mr  Matthias  Yao  have\r\n\r\npointed out, in fact, this is a pro-jobs, pro-growth  and\r\n\r\npro-worker   Budget.   The  Budget  aims  at   preserving\r\n\r\nexisting  jobs and creating new and better jobs  for  our\r\n\r\npeople.   But all the budget measures are only  enablers,\r\n\r\nbecause  success lies in our people seeing, creating  and\r\n\r\nseizing the opportunities that come our way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the immediate term, reducing costs is important.\r\n\r\nBut, ultimately, to create more jobs, we need to look for\r\n\r\nnew businesses and create new value.  We are making major\r\n\r\nstrategic  shifts,  and  we  must  get  them  right   and\r\n\r\nimplement the changes speedily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang complained that the cost of\r\n\r\nliving  is very high.  If I may borrow a phrase from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Foreign  Affairs,  he  is  a   very   good\r\n\r\nstoryteller.   In  fact, last year,  the  consumer  price\r\n\r\nindex  fell  by  0.4%, despite the public transport  fare\r\n\r\nincrease.   Many basic food items cost less,  like  rice,\r\n\r\ncooking oil, meat, seafood and vegetables.  Housing  cost\r\n\r\n2.2%  less,  because of electricity tariffs coming  down,\r\n\r\naccommodation  and  household durables becoming  cheaper.\r\n\r\nTransport and communication costs fell by 1%, because  of\r\n\r\ncheaper  petrol and the lower road tax.  Only  healthcare\r\n\r\nand education costs rose marginally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the CPI fell, nominal wages went up by about\r\n\r\n1%  last  year.  Mr Steve Chia asked for  a  30%  cut  in\r\n\r\nMinisters'  salaries.  How will this solve  our  problem?\r\n\r\nIf  it  is to be a symbolic gesture, then we had  already\r\n\r\ndone it in November 2001, when we cut monthly salaries of\r\n\r\nMinisters by 10%.  And, if we take it together with  cuts\r\n\r\nin  annual  payments, in fact, the result was an  overall\r\n\r\nreduction of 20% in annual remuneration. Last November we\r\n\r\nextended  the  cut  for another 12 months  till  December\r\n\r\n2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members, such as Dr Warren Lee and Dr Teo Ho\r\n\r\nPin,  have  asked for more help to be given to the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group.   This  we will do.   The  Government  has\r\n\r\nalready  implemented  substantial measures  to  help  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  in  this  year's and last  year's  budgets,\r\n\r\nspecially  focused  on the lower income  group.   We  are\r\n\r\nproviding  additional help where it means  the  most,  in\r\n\r\nbasic household expenditure items, such as utilities  and\r\n\r\nService  &  Conservancy  (S&C) charges.   The  Government\r\n\r\nextended  the  Utilities Save scheme  by  one  year,  and\r\n\r\ngranted an extra month of rebates on S&C charges for  all\r\n\r\n1-  to  5-room HDB flats.  So, come April, all the  flats\r\n\r\nwill be spared S&C charges.  And these are over and above\r\n\r\nthe previous provisions.  Also, we should not forget that\r\n\r\nby  staggering the GST increase into two steps,  we  have\r\n\r\neffectively  given Singaporeans a very large rebate  this\r\n\r\nyear of $650 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Khalis, Dr Warren Lee and Mdm Ho Geok Choo\r\n\r\nalso spoke on maintaining the social fabric and providing\r\n\r\nadditional help to those who cannot pay utilities  bills.\r\n\r\nWe  will  do that.  However, we should keep the lines  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  clear.  Power Supply  is  not  a  welfare\r\n\r\norganisation.  Its bills have to be paid.  But people who\r\n\r\nneed  help paying these bills should try to get help from\r\n\r\nthe  CDCs  and  CCCs, where ample help is available.   We\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  depend  on  the  grassroots  leaders   to\r\n\r\ndistinguish between those in genuine need and  those  who\r\n\r\ncan  help themselves to be more self-reliant.  With their\r\n\r\nassessment, with their sensitive management, where  there\r\n\r\nis  discrimination, we can deliver the help where  it  is\r\n\r\nmost  needed, without discouraging a lot of other  people\r\n\r\nfrom working and looking after themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members, including Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran  and Mdm Cynthia Phua, have said that the  middle\r\n\r\nincome group's concerns have not been addressed.  I think\r\n\r\nthey are mistaken.  Rightly, we have focused our help  on\r\n\r\nthe   lower   income  group.   However,  we   have   also\r\n\r\nimplemented  measures for the middle income  group.   The\r\n\r\nUtilities Save and the S&CC rebates are weighted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntowards  the  1- and 3-roomers, but they have  also  been\r\n\r\nextended towards the 4- and 5-roomers.  Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  income group will benefit significantly from  the\r\n\r\n1%  GST deferment, because their consumption level  is  a\r\n\r\nlot  higher than the lower income group.  So, we have not\r\n\r\nforgotten the middle income group in this Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs, including Mrs Fang Ai Lian, Mr Gan Kim\r\n\r\nYong and others as well, expressed regret that we did not\r\n\r\ngive   further  rebates  for  personal  income  tax   and\r\n\r\ncorporate  income  tax this year, nor did  we  lower  the\r\n\r\nrates by another one percentage point.  But do not forget\r\n\r\nthat individuals and companies are already enjoying lower\r\n\r\npersonal  and corporate taxes this year, as a  result  of\r\n\r\nlast   year's   substantial  tax  cuts.   There   is   no\r\n\r\njustification  for  giving them tax  rebates  on  top  of\r\n\r\nthese, considering the tight budgetary position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for lowering the rates by another one percentage\r\n\r\npoint, remember that it would only affect the taxes to be\r\n\r\npaid  next year, in the Year of Assessment 2004.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot  going  to put money in people's pockets  this  year.\r\n\r\nSo, given the uncertainties ahead, it would be unwise  of\r\n\r\nus  to  commit now to being generous next year.   If  the\r\n\r\nsituation pans out favourably, it will not be too late to\r\n\r\nconsider an income tax rebate next year.  If it does not,\r\n\r\nwe will have to reconsider our position.  But what counts\r\n\r\nfor  investors and businesses is our long-term tax  plan.\r\n\r\nFor  that, we have already committed to bringing down the\r\n\r\ntop rates to 20% by the Year of Assessment 2005.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On help for businesses, one item of attention has\r\n\r\nbeen  industrial land costs.  Mr Inderjit Singh, Dr  John\r\n\r\nChen,  Mr  Nithiah  Nandan and several other  MPs  raised\r\n\r\nthis.   We  cannot match the lowest land prices available\r\n\r\nin  China or Vietnam, nor do we need to do so.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nsometimes,  land  is  given  away  for  free   in   these\r\n\r\ncountries.   But the Government will ensure  an  adequate\r\n\r\nsupply   of   industrial  land  to  achieve  stable   and\r\n\r\ninternationally   competitive  land   prices.    Already,\r\n\r\nindustrial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nland  prices have come down by about 45% from their  peak\r\n\r\nin 1996.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that the Government\r\n\r\nshould  announce  its intention to lower industrial  land\r\n\r\nprices   drastically.   I  think  the  last   thing   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  do  is  to destabilise  the  property\r\n\r\nmarket.  He may recall that, last year, he made the  same\r\n\r\nproposal  on  residential properties -  to  reduce  their\r\n\r\nprices  by  30%.   And I advised him to be  very  careful\r\n\r\nabout what he said, because his voters who own their  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  would not be pleased, and they are also my voters.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  this year, he has repeated  the  argument\r\n\r\nfor  industrial land.  There are thousands  of  companies\r\n\r\nowning industrial land, and many banks have lent money to\r\n\r\nfactories  against  industrial land  as  collateral.   It\r\n\r\nwould  be  reckless  to  alarm  all  of  them  with  rash\r\n\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need to be rash. We can ensure that our\r\n\r\nland   market  is  efficient  and  flexible,   and   that\r\n\r\nmultinationals   coming  here  have   enough   affordable\r\n\r\nindustrial  land for their operations.  There is  enough.\r\n\r\nWe  can  do that because, under the Master Plan, we  have\r\n\r\nreserved at least 12,000 hectares for industrial use and,\r\n\r\nso  far,  only  7,300  hectares of this  are  in  use  by\r\n\r\nindustries.   As  most  industrial  land  is  held  on  a\r\n\r\nleasehold  basis, the supply is renewable  and  ample  to\r\n\r\nmeet  long-term demand.  Because, every year, some leases\r\n\r\nwill  expire and the land is taken back and  can  be  re-allocated  again.   We  have  also  been  successful   in\r\n\r\nintensifying the use of the land so that we can  get  all\r\n\r\nthe  industrial  floor space that  we  need,  whether  to\r\n\r\nattract new investments or to enable existing investments\r\n\r\nto expand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chee How and several other MPs suggested\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government's land use policy was to blame  for\r\n\r\nour  woes.    Particularly, they cited an alleged  policy\r\n\r\nwhereby  we priced land in terms of its alternative  use.\r\n\r\nBut  industrial land prices are not pegged to alternative\r\n\r\nuses,  such as residential or commercial purposes.   Land\r\n\r\nis  zoned  specifically for different uses, such  as  for\r\n\r\nindustries,  and  tendered out  for  that  purpose.   So,\r\n\r\nindustrial uses are only competing against\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nother  industrial  uses,  and  commercial  against  other\r\n\r\ncommercial  uses, and so on.  With ample  supply,  prices\r\n\r\nshould remain competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen suggested that high industrial land\r\n\r\ncost  contributed to the recent PSA retrenchment.  He  is\r\n\r\nnot  right,  because PSA is charged very reasonable  land\r\n\r\nprices,  and land cost is not a significant component  of\r\n\r\nPSA's  total costs.  Labour is.  The retrenchment in  PSA\r\n\r\nis not due to land pricing but, rather, through redundant\r\n\r\noverheads.   Faced  with  intensifying  competition,  PSA\r\n\r\ncannot   afford  to  carry  overheads  which  no   longer\r\n\r\ncontribute   to  its  businesses,  and   they   have   no\r\n\r\nalternative but to rationalise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On rebates, a number of MPs - Dr Warren Lee, Dr Teo\r\n\r\nHo Pin and Mr Nithiah Nandan - have asked for the various\r\n\r\nrebates which I introduced to be extended, preferably for\r\n\r\ntwo to three years.  Members should remember that rebates\r\n\r\nare  meant as temporary measures, and they should not  be\r\n\r\npermanent.   They are different in nature  from  the  CPF\r\n\r\nfreeze.  Let me explain why.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF is a statutory cost imposed on employers and\r\n\r\nemployees.   It is an imposition.  It achieves  important\r\n\r\nsocial objectives, but it is a burden on businesses.   We\r\n\r\ncan only raise the CPF rates and increase the burden when\r\n\r\nthe  economy  is strong enough, which means  not  earlier\r\n\r\nthan two years from now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the JTC and HDB rental rebates\r\n\r\nare  concessions to the existing tenants.  In  principle,\r\n\r\ntenants  should pay market rentals all the time,  whether\r\n\r\nthe  economy  is up or down, and, of course,  the  market\r\n\r\nrentals  will  go  up  and down with  the  state  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   In  that way, the companies which  are  viable\r\n\r\nwill come into the business, and the companies which  are\r\n\r\nno  longer viable will leave the business.  But  to  give\r\n\r\nthe  people  who are already tenants, who are already  in\r\n\r\nbusiness, some respite, some time to catch their  breath,\r\n\r\nwe  have given the rebates to help them to pay less  than\r\n\r\nthe  market rentals, and to give them more time to adjust\r\n\r\nto the new conditions.  Over\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  long term, however, we cannot freeze this flow.   We\r\n\r\nmust  allow  the natural entry and exit of companies  and\r\n\r\nbusinesses  because, if we continue the rebates  for  too\r\n\r\nlong,  then in fact we are holding back the restructuring\r\n\r\nof  our  economy.  So, it is better to extend the rebates\r\n\r\nfor  six  months, and reassess the situation  again  next\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon raised the concern of Government\r\n\r\nfees  and  charges  contributing to  the  cost  of  doing\r\n\r\nbusiness.   I have great sympathy with this  view.   They\r\n\r\nmay  be  small amounts, but they do add up.  We are  very\r\n\r\nconscious of this, and we are making every effort to keep\r\n\r\nour  fees  and charges as low as possible.   However,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  totally  do  away  with  all  fees  and  charges.\r\n\r\nNothing is for free.  Ultimately, someone has to foot the\r\n\r\nbill.  Either the users pay, or we have to fund it out of\r\n\r\ngeneral taxes, which may mean raising tax rates.   Or  we\r\n\r\nwill  have to cut back on services and provide  fewer  or\r\n\r\nlower  quality  services, contrary to  all  the  requests\r\n\r\nwhich  I have heard over the last three days from MPs  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  service quality of Government  departments.\r\n\r\nMr  Tan cited DVDs getting cheaper year by year.  That is\r\n\r\ntrue.  But services are not getting cheaper year by year,\r\n\r\nunlike  electronic goods, because skilled people are  not\r\n\r\ngetting  cheaper.  For example, medical costs are getting\r\n\r\nmore  and  more expensive everywhere, as medical  science\r\n\r\nand technology improve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will make sure that its operations\r\n\r\nare  run as efficiently as possible and, sometimes,  this\r\n\r\nwill mean retrenchments and downsizing, like in HDB.  But\r\n\r\nwe  cannot avoid these tough choices.  However, the  best\r\n\r\nway  to keep costs down for businesses is not through ad-hoc  rebates  but,  rather,  through  prudent  Government\r\n\r\nspending to keep the overall tax burden on businesses  as\r\n\r\nlow  as  possible  permanently.  And we  have  kept  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  lean,  with  Government  spending  this  year\r\n\r\naccounting  for  only  19% of GDP.  The  Government  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to keep its size small.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members - Mr Tan Soo Khoon, Mr Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh, Mr Loh Meng See and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDr  John  Chen - said that the deficit is not  real,  and\r\n\r\nthat the Government should have run a bigger deficit.  We\r\n\r\ndid better than expected in FY 2002 because, fortunately,\r\n\r\nwe  underspent our budget.  It is true that we had higher\r\n\r\nthan  projected  Net Investment Income contribution  but,\r\n\r\nremember,  our tax revenues were lower than expected  and\r\n\r\nthe  two  variations  cancelled  each  other  out.   Some\r\n\r\nMembers seem to regret this.  Somehow, they are sad  that\r\n\r\nwe did not run a deficit as big as we expected.  But I am\r\n\r\nglad  that,  as a result, we were able to make additional\r\n\r\nspecial  transfers to the Lifelong Learning Fund and  the\r\n\r\nMedifund.  However, we cannot expect such happy surprises\r\n\r\nall  the  time.   From time to time, the Budget  out-turn\r\n\r\nswings against us. For example, in FY 2001, we forecasted\r\n\r\na  budget surplus but we ended up with a deficit of  $2.7\r\n\r\nbillion.  And there are many uncertainties when  you  are\r\n\r\nlooking ahead, even 12 months, especially in a year  like\r\n\r\nthis one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we had to decide very carefully how large\r\n\r\na  deficit  we  needed  in this FY 2003  Budget.  We  are\r\n\r\nrunning  a  budget deficit for the third year in  a  row.\r\n\r\nThis   is   not  an  illusion.   Where  the   items   are\r\n\r\nmeritorious,  we  have  not cut  back  on  spending,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  on  security.   And we  are  making  a  special\r\n\r\ntransfer  of $600 million to the ERS account.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nspecial  transfer, but it is money which is going  to  be\r\n\r\npaid  out  and that will put cash directly into  people's\r\n\r\nhands for them to spend if they wish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon also said that the Government\r\n\r\nshould draw upon the surpluses of the statutory boards as\r\n\r\na  supplementary source of revenue.  It  is  a  plausible\r\n\r\npresentation of a seductive idea. The surpluses of  these\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards have been accumulated  over  very  many\r\n\r\nyears.  But on a year-to-year basis, the statutory boards\r\n\r\nare  only running modest surpluses, which they ought  to,\r\n\r\nbecause they are meant to generate sufficient revenue  to\r\n\r\nfund their activities and we should be thankful that they\r\n\r\nare  able  to  do  so and do not need  to  fall  back  on\r\n\r\nGovernment spending.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory boards do make regular contributions to\r\n\r\nthe  Government  but,  compared to  our  overall  revenue\r\n\r\nneeds,  these  are  not significant.   Also,  to  put  it\r\n\r\nbluntly,  we should not be thinking of raiding the  bank.\r\n\r\nWe  can only do it once and after that, we will be  poor.\r\n\r\nIt   is  precisely  to  stop  populist  governments  from\r\n\r\nspending these reserves that the bigger statutory  boards\r\n\r\nlike JTC are protected with the President's second key.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs, of course, would prefer us to have\r\n\r\nbudgeted  for a larger deficit so that more sweets  could\r\n\r\nbe  distributed  all round.  But are  they  sure  that  a\r\n\r\nlarger  deficit  would instill greater  confidence  among\r\n\r\nanalysts and investors?  Might analysts and investors not\r\n\r\nsee  it as a weakening of fiscal discipline, an inability\r\n\r\nto  tighten our belts?  The same people who now say  that\r\n\r\nthey  are disappointed we did not open our purses,  would\r\n\r\nturn  around and say that they are alarmed that  we  have\r\n\r\ntaken leave of our prudence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran and others made a comparison with Hong\r\n\r\nKong's  recent  Budget.   This is a very,  very  relevant\r\n\r\ncomparison.  I draw three conclusions from the Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nexperience.  Firstly, it shows how quickly a country  can\r\n\r\nmove  from  a  large budget surplus to a  chronic  fiscal\r\n\r\ndeficit.  Hong Kong was in an enviable position,  just  a\r\n\r\nfew  years ago, generating a surplus of more than  6%  of\r\n\r\nGDP  in  1997,  the  year of the handover.   Now,  it  is\r\n\r\nprojecting a deficit of about HK$70 billion,  5%  of  GDP\r\n\r\nfor  this  year, after running deficits for the preceding\r\n\r\ntwo years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, despite the large deficit, the Hong Kong\r\n\r\neconomy  is  stagnant.  Like Singapore, Hong  Kong  is  a\r\n\r\nsmall  and open economy, and deficit spending is  not  an\r\n\r\neffective way to boost demand.  So do not think that,  if\r\n\r\nonly  we  would open our wallets, the problems  would  go\r\n\r\naway  and  we would all get a warm feeling.   It  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, once we fall into the pattern of a large\r\n\r\ndeficit,  it is very difficult to get out from the  black\r\n\r\nhole.  We may say that the spending is temporary, but the\r\n\r\nreality, as you will know from your appeals on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  rebates,  is that it is very difficult  to  withdraw\r\n\r\ntemporary concessions.  Hong Kong is now having to  raise\r\n\r\ntaxes in a slow economy, which is extremely tricky,  both\r\n\r\npolitically and economically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, given the uncertain outlook, it would be\r\n\r\npremature  for us to have a highly stimulative budget  to\r\n\r\ntry to boost our economy.  It is better for us to take  a\r\n\r\nconservative stance now.  If things do worsen  later  on,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  can  take comfort that the  Government  has\r\n\r\navailable  bullets  to expend.  Not only  should  we  not\r\n\r\nshoot  off  all our bullets now, but we need to  see  the\r\n\r\nsituation  develop further before it will be  clear  what\r\n\r\ntargets  we should aim at with our bullets so as  to  get\r\n\r\nmaximum effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the short-term considerations. We should\r\n\r\nalso  not  lose  sight  of  the  longer-term  dimensions,\r\n\r\nstarting   with   the  international   backdrop.   Global\r\n\r\ncompetition is intensifying. Mr Tan Soo Khoon  eloquently\r\n\r\ncited  some examples, so did other MPs.  We have  got  to\r\n\r\nkeep our system lean.  We have got to remain nimble,  and\r\n\r\nsearch for new growth niches and opportunities. Our  past\r\n\r\nsuccess is no guarantee of continued high growth.  We can\r\n\r\nsee  many  examples  of countries  which  have  run  into\r\n\r\ndifficulties  because they cannot change and  adapt  fast\r\n\r\nenough,  not  that  they do not know  it,  but  they  are\r\n\r\nfrozen, they are unable to do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in Germany, as reported in the Business\r\n\r\nWeek   recently,  enormous  structural  impediments  have\r\n\r\nstalled  Germany's progress. At the core of it all  is  a\r\n\r\njob  protection  law that makes it almost impossible  for\r\n\r\nemployers to lay off workers.  Any company with more than\r\n\r\nfive employees is subject to this law.  So companies stay\r\n\r\nbelow six so as not to be caught.  And the result of this\r\n\r\nis  11% unemployment, because the more you try to protect\r\n\r\njobs,  the  fewer jobs will be created. German  companies\r\n\r\navoid  hiring  workers even when there is  business,  and\r\n\r\nthey  invest all over the world, rather than  in  Germany\r\n\r\nitself, and little foreign investment goes to Germany.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, we see countries which are rising\r\n\r\nrapidly, like China and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIndia,  which  puts  pressure  on  all  other  countries.\r\n\r\nChina's competitive advantage will be low-cost labour for\r\n\r\nsome time yet.  While China dominates the world in labour-intensive products, it will also become a major  importer\r\n\r\nof   capital-intensive   goods  and   knowledge-intensive\r\n\r\nservices.  In the longer-term, the emergence of China and\r\n\r\nIndia  are undoubtedly positive developments for  us.   A\r\n\r\nmore   prosperous  China  and  India  would  mean  bigger\r\n\r\nmarkets,  more  investment opportunities, bigger  trading\r\n\r\npartners for Singapore and the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business to China is growing. We are not just\r\n\r\nimporting more from them, we are exporting a lot more  to\r\n\r\nthem.  Last year, our exports to China grew by about 28%,\r\n\r\nto  more than $12 billion.  Our combined exports to China\r\n\r\nand  India now equal to more than half our total  exports\r\n\r\nto the US.  Those countries and those companies which can\r\n\r\nget  organised  faster would be able to  move  ahead  and\r\n\r\nseize the opportunities that these rising economies bring\r\n\r\nwith  them.   And  some of our companies and  people  are\r\n\r\nalready  making  inroads  into  the  Chinese  and  Indian\r\n\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, you may have heard of Dr Tan Hock, a\r\n\r\nSingapore  entrepreneur  in  Shanghai,  whose  story  was\r\n\r\ncarried on some of our radio stations.  He found a  niche\r\n\r\nin  the  knowledge-based industry in China, by  animating\r\n\r\nthe  12  zodiac  characters into cartoon  characters  and\r\n\r\ncreated  an  industry  - cartoons  as  well  as  all  the\r\n\r\nproducts  to  sell with the cartoons.  And  he  is  doing\r\n\r\nwell.   His  creations  are now  broadcast  in  over  130\r\n\r\nstations across China and 10 stations in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are people who venture into India too. You\r\n\r\nwould  have read about a group of retrenched Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho made good setting up a factory producing ring binders\r\n\r\nin a small rural Indian village called Tiruvallore.  When\r\n\r\nPresident Nathan visited Tamil Nadu recently, they turned\r\n\r\nup  to  meet him, which is probably how the Straits Times\r\n\r\nfound out about them.  It was a remote village. They went\r\n\r\nthere,  they set up shop, they made it viable, they  even\r\n\r\nlearnt Tamil, albeit a few words, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  think  they  take  turns coming  home  because  living\r\n\r\nconditions there are hard.  But they press on.  And there\r\n\r\nis  another company which invested half a million dollars\r\n\r\nand  set up something called Technigroup India to provide\r\n\r\nmodern office furniture in India.  They managed to break-even within a year and generated $3 million turnover last\r\n\r\nyear.   The  opportunities are there  and  we  must  take\r\n\r\nadvantage   of  them.   And  that  is  the  international\r\n\r\nbackdrop   against  which  we  are  making  our  domestic\r\n\r\nchanges, starting with our tax changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked airily what was so radical\r\n\r\nabout our tax changes.  It is a very significant shift to\r\n\r\nbring  individual and corporate tax rates down to 20%  by\r\n\r\nYA  2005  and to raise GST to broaden our tax base.   How\r\n\r\nmany  other  countries can do that?  Our  tax  rates  are\r\n\r\ncompetitive for now, but we will need to keep  tabs  over\r\n\r\nthe  long term and be prepared to go lower, if necessary.\r\n\r\nWe  are  also  making other strategic changes,  exempting\r\n\r\nforeign  source  income,  domestic  interest  income  and\r\n\r\nenhancing taxation on intellectual property, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nAs  Mrs Fang Ai Lian has told Members, and she knows  the\r\n\r\nbusiness,  these are important structural changes  which,\r\n\r\nover  time,  will  develop a lot of  new  businesses  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CPF, which is our second major change, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank MPs like Mr Ong Ah Heng, Mdm Halimah  and\r\n\r\nMrs  Lim  Hwee Hua who have voiced support  for  the  CPF\r\n\r\ndeferment.   We are grateful for their support  from  the\r\n\r\nunions and the workers. They have understood and accepted\r\n\r\nthe need for the change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no expectation of a restoration of the CPF\r\n\r\nthis   year  anyway.   And  even  if  the  economy   does\r\n\r\nmoderately  well  this year, by January  2004,  it  would\r\n\r\nprobably  not  have done strongly enough  for  us  to  be\r\n\r\nconfident enough to warrant a restoration of the  CPF  in\r\n\r\n2004.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what we are essentially asking Singaporeans to do\r\n\r\nis merely to commit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnow  what we would have to decide in 12 months anyway and\r\n\r\nto  say, yes, let us decide now, we will freeze it for 24\r\n\r\nmonths  and  get on our feet during that time.  It  is  a\r\n\r\ncommitment which we can make, and a commitment which will\r\n\r\nbe  an important signal to investors that we are prepared\r\n\r\nto do what it takes to get our economy back on track.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and others raised the question of\r\n\r\nthe  long-term  CPF  structure and the  question  of  the\r\n\r\nconcept of retirement.  How can we save enough in our CPF\r\n\r\naccounts  while we are working, so that we can retire  at\r\n\r\n62  and  then  live on our CPF savings and hopefully  our\r\n\r\nchildren  for  another 20 years or  longer?   It  is  not\r\n\r\nrealistic  and  it  will become an  increasingly  serious\r\n\r\nproblem  as life expectancy goes up, our population  ages\r\n\r\nand our birth rate goes down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to find ways therefore to keep our older\r\n\r\nworkers  employed and working beyond their 50s  and  60s,\r\n\r\nthough  not  necessarily in the same job or at  the  same\r\n\r\npay.   Workers have to be prepared to take on  second  or\r\n\r\neven third careers.  What can we do to help them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, mindset change and skills upgrading\r\n\r\nare  important, as pointed our by Ms Braema, Mr Seng  Han\r\n\r\nThong and Mr Andy Gan.  Workers must be prepared to adapt\r\n\r\nand to make adjustments.  We have to continue training to\r\n\r\nstay  on  the job or reskill and move on to another  job,\r\n\r\nand  many also have to take on lighter jobs at lower  pay\r\n\r\nand  work part-time.  To carry on doing what you used  to\r\n\r\ndo,  at a slower rate, and yet expecting employers to pay\r\n\r\nthe  same or even more, is simply not viable.  But it  is\r\n\r\nessential  to  find  other  work  or  work  on  different\r\n\r\nemployment terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must keep the labour market flexible so as to\r\n\r\npreserve  jobs  and maximise employment,  especially  for\r\n\r\nolder workers.  The CPF system adds to business cost.  If\r\n\r\nthe CPF system is to be sustainable, it cannot impose too\r\n\r\nonerous a burden on companies to employ workers.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nworkers,  especially those at the lower  end,  want  more\r\n\r\ntake-home   pay.   Hence,  we  are  reducing   employee's\r\n\r\ncontributions for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  lower-income workers and also for the older  workers\r\n\r\naged  50-55.   But there is a trade-off  because  if  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  is too low, workers would  not  have  saved\r\n\r\nenough  for housing, healthcare or old age and,  as  Miss\r\n\r\nPenny Low analysed, they will fall back on the Government\r\n\r\nwhen they need a house, fall ill or grow old.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we have to balance two perspectives - the CPF as\r\n\r\ncompulsory savings, which we would like to have  as  high\r\n\r\nas  possible,  against the CPF as a  cost  to  businesses\r\n\r\nwhich  we would like to keep as low as possible.  In  the\r\n\r\nearlier years, when our growth was high and incomes  were\r\n\r\nrising  rapidly,  we emphasised more  on  CPF's  role  as\r\n\r\ncompulsory savings and pushed it up whenever we could, so\r\n\r\nas not to let people get used to spending the money.  Now\r\n\r\nthat  we are in a tougher operating environment, we  have\r\n\r\nto   strike   a   different  balance  between   the   two\r\n\r\nperspectives.   But  we  should not  give  up  the  first\r\n\r\nperspective  of  the CPF as compulsory savings  entirely,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is still valid.  Without the CPF scheme,  we\r\n\r\nwould have a different Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second major theme is entrepreneurship and SMEs.\r\n\r\nMr  Raymond  Lim  has adequately addressed  this  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech.   As Ms Indranee and Dr Chong Weng Chiew  pointed\r\n\r\nout,  entrepreneurial  spirit is  about  taking  personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility and achieving success through his  or  her\r\n\r\nown  efforts  and  abilities, rather  than  depending  on\r\n\r\nlargesse  from the Government.  If you say, \"Please  help\r\n\r\nme  to  become an entrepreneur\", chances are you  already\r\n\r\nmiss  one  of  the  ingredients for  starting.   In  many\r\n\r\naspects, the Government should do less rather than  more.\r\n\r\nIt should act as a last resort, and not a first recourse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we heard Dr Gan See Khem tell us in vivid\r\n\r\npersonal  terms  her first-hand experience,  her  gung-ho\r\n\r\nspirit  and  her passion, fighting for what she  believes\r\n\r\nin.   And her HMI Holdings is exactly what we are looking\r\n\r\nfor.   It  will  always be challenging to  start  up  new\r\n\r\nbusinesses, and to venture outside Singapore will be even\r\n\r\nharder.   If  entrepreneurship was  simple,  and  anybody\r\n\r\ncould do it,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  rewards  would not be great.  Dr  Gan  See  Khem  is\r\n\r\nexceptional,  as  she persevered and fought  against  the\r\n\r\nodds.   We  need more people like her, and the Government\r\n\r\nwill do its best to help them succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry it has taken her so long for her to deal\r\n\r\nwith the agencies.  I asked the agencies and they tell me\r\n\r\nthat  they  had  good reasons, and there are  significant\r\n\r\nissues in assuring the standards of her training courses,\r\n\r\nbut  that they are doing their best to resolve these with\r\n\r\nDr  Gan expeditiously.  It is our job to help, even  when\r\n\r\nit does not appear that we are doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that we should shift our\r\n\r\nfocus away from multi-nationals and rely on SMEs.  He  is\r\n\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> In addition to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> In addition to - he is\r\n\r\ncorrect.  We will encourage small companies and start-ups\r\n\r\nbut we still need the MNCs.  SMEs can complement them but\r\n\r\ncannot replace them.  We have hundreds of multi-nationals\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   Even if our efforts  to  grow  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies  are wildly successful, we will only  create  a\r\n\r\ndozen or so MNCs of our own, and even that is being very,\r\n\r\nvery   optimistic.   We  need  both  MNCs  and  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  diversify and to grow our economy  and  to\r\n\r\ncreate enough jobs for our people.  However, I agree with\r\n\r\nMr  Inderjit  Singh that more can be done  to  help  SMEs\r\n\r\nnavigate our bureaucracy.  SPRING Singapore is the  focal\r\n\r\nagency for assisting them.  We have many things in  mind,\r\n\r\nincluding  helping SMEs to get access to financing  in  a\r\n\r\nmarket-based way.  However, we have to bear in mind  that\r\n\r\nno  matter how much financing we provide, there can never\r\n\r\nbe enough for all the SMEs which want it.  SMEs will have\r\n\r\nto  compete  for  financing, and only  those  which  look\r\n\r\nviable and can convince the investors or lenders will  be\r\n\r\nable to get it.  This is an unavoidable Darwinian process\r\n\r\nof attrition.  Without it, you will not have strong SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs, Chew Heng Ching, Ng Ser Miang, Zainudin\r\n\r\nNordin  and, memorably, Dr Amy Khor, have spoken out  for\r\n\r\nmindset  change from the civil service to  be  more  pro-business.  Indeed, the civil service is already trying to\r\n\r\ndo this, and we will have to do more.  From time to time,\r\n\r\nwe organise sessions in the civil service for the private\r\n\r\nsector  to come and to share their perspectives with  the\r\n\r\ncivil  servants.  I will ask them, in future,  to  invite\r\n\r\nsome  MPs to speak, and I think if Dr Amy Khor and others\r\n\r\ncan come and present to them the way they presented it in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  it will have an impact, and  some  positive\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pro-enterprise panel chaired by the Head\r\n\r\nof  the  Civil  Service, with ten members, six  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector,  and Mr Inderjit Singh  is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers.   The  panel receives feedback, suggestions  and\r\n\r\ncomplaints   from  businesses  against   rules   and   on\r\n\r\ndifficulties dealing with the different agencies.  It has\r\n\r\nreceived more than 600 suggestions since it was formed in\r\n\r\nAugust  2000, and about half of these have been accepted.\r\n\r\nOn average, it took 29 days to settle a case.  Change has\r\n\r\nbeen quite quick, because issues are put directly to  the\r\n\r\nHeads  of Departments and CEOs of statutory boards.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  we amended the Auctioneers' Licences Act  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of feedback to the panel and this enabled on-line\r\n\r\nauctions.  So, I advise anybody who is unhappy about  any\r\n\r\nrule to put his case to the panel and it will give a full\r\n\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a Rules Review Panel which we set up\r\n\r\nin May last year.  Every Ministry and statutory board has\r\n\r\nto  review all its rules within three years - that  means\r\n\r\nby  the  end  of FY 2004 - and thereafter on a  five-year\r\n\r\nrolling  basis, as Amy Khor says, this is  a  rule  about\r\n\r\nrules.   One  result  is  that  about  one-third  of  173\r\n\r\nstatutory declarations required by the Government will be\r\n\r\nremoved  by  the  end of this financial  year.   To  give\r\n\r\nanother  example, Mindef reviewed 135 rules, deleted  80,\r\n\r\nsimplified 40 and retained 15.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Prof. Low Seow Chay gave an example of a rule\r\n\r\nwhich we ought to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nretain  and  that has to do with odour control.   He  was\r\n\r\ntalking  about chicken farms.  His neighbouring MPs  will\r\n\r\nknow exactly what he is talking about.  His complaint was\r\n\r\nthat  we  could not specify the standard of air freshness\r\n\r\nneeded  or  be  sure  what odour  control  process  would\r\n\r\nproduce fresh enough air.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, smells from chicken farms pose a real\r\n\r\nproblem in a compact city like Singapore.  The Government\r\n\r\ndid  introduce a new odour control rule when  we  started\r\n\r\nbuilding flats around the farms.  However, it is not true\r\n\r\nthat the Government kept changing the rule.  The National\r\n\r\nEnvironment  Agency is still pursuing the matter,  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  the  farms  have  not  met  the  required  odour\r\n\r\nstandards  -  meaning they have not installed  what  they\r\n\r\nwere supposed to install.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you the real story. There were four\r\n\r\nchicken  farms  in Sungei Tengah.  They were  causing  an\r\n\r\nodour problem.  They were given a choice of closing  down\r\n\r\nand  accepting  an  ex gratia payment or  continuing  and\r\n\r\ninstalling odour control filters.  Three closed down  and\r\n\r\ntook  the  ex  gratia payment, one chose to  proceed  and\r\n\r\nupgrade.   But  after it committed to install  the  odour\r\n\r\ncontrol equipment, it failed to install everything it was\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  do,  causing  a  great  smell  nuisance  to\r\n\r\nresidents in the neighbouring constituencies.  Hence  the\r\n\r\nproblem, which in due course will be solved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me remind Members that after all the\r\n\r\npromotional  efforts,  all the  rules  cutting,  all  the\r\n\r\nincentives,   whether  we  can  be   successful   as   an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial society and economy, ultimately it  boils\r\n\r\ndown to talent.  Do we have the people who can seize  the\r\n\r\nopportunities?   Do we have businessmen with  a  business\r\n\r\nsense  and  that drive and dare?  Without them,  all  the\r\n\r\nefforts and the nurturing will be in vain.  I think if we\r\n\r\nconfine ourselves only to Singaporeans, we will not  have\r\n\r\nenough entrepreneurial talent.  There will be a few,  but\r\n\r\nwe  will  not have enough.  If we really want  to  be  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial   society,  we   must   attract   foreign\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs to Singapore to start their business  here,\r\n\r\nand that we are doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about services. The ERC's\r\n\r\nrecommendation  is that we have to upgrade  manufacturing\r\n\r\nand  services.  There is no guaranteed business, not even\r\n\r\nat  the  lower end.  But we are confident that we can  do\r\n\r\nwell  by upgrading what we have.  Yes, others will pursue\r\n\r\nthe  same  strategy, but I believe that we can  implement\r\n\r\nthis strategy better and faster than others.  We have the\r\n\r\nedge, as our foundation is strong.  We are nimble and  we\r\n\r\ncan move faster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Khaw Boon Wan touched on services in his speech.\r\n\r\nThe  Government is serious about promoting  this  as  the\r\n\r\nsecond  engine  of  growth,  and  there  is  good  growth\r\n\r\npotential in healthcare, education and creative services.\r\n\r\nI  agree with Dr Lily Neo that we are well positioned  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  regional healthcare hub.  I spoke to some  private\r\n\r\nsector doctors recently and they expressed great optimism\r\n\r\nabout  our  chances.   We  have  traditional  markets  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  Indonesia, and we are also  expanding  our\r\n\r\nmarkets  further afield, to new customers like  Arabs  in\r\n\r\nthe  Middle-East, Bangladeshis, even Mongolians.  I asked\r\n\r\nthem,  \"Do Mongolians speak English?\"  They said  at  the\r\n\r\nupper  end,  it is no problem.  They have the money,  and\r\n\r\nthey will come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly for education services. Raffles LaSalle\r\n\r\nLimited now runs five schools in China, with an intake of\r\n\r\nmore  than 1,000 students.  Today, in Singapore, we  have\r\n\r\nmore  than 23,000 PRC students studying here.  There  are\r\n\r\nsocial  considerations involved here  too,  and  also  in\r\n\r\nservice  sectors  like healthcare.  If  they  are  really\r\n\r\nstudents  studying,  that is  fine.   If  they  are  just\r\n\r\nstudents in name, that may be a problem.  But we have  to\r\n\r\nmanage  these  problems,  and we  cannot  turn  away  the\r\n\r\nbusiness.  The Ministerial Committee is going to make the\r\n\r\ntrade-offs and strike the balance between the social  and\r\n\r\nthe economic considerations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not just targeting the high end of the\r\n\r\nservices  industry, as Mdm Yu-Foo Yee Shoon pointed  out.\r\n\r\nThere are opportunities in our traditional segments  like\r\n\r\nhair-dressing,  retail  and entertainment.   However,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, there is no\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnon-tradable sector that we can shield from competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann suggested that maybe if we build a\r\n\r\nstrong  globalised  economy,  then  we  can  support   an\r\n\r\ninefficient  domestic sector which can provide  jobs  for\r\n\r\nolder  Singaporeans.  I listened to  him  twice  to  make\r\n\r\nsure,  but  he did mean that - to support an  inefficient\r\n\r\ndomestic  sector and provide some jobs.  Other  countries\r\n\r\nhave  tried that, like Japan, where in the retail sector,\r\n\r\nlots  of  people are employed, but they just look  pretty\r\n\r\nand stand at the elevators and bow each time you go past.\r\n\r\nIt  has not worked for Japan, and it is not feasible  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We  have no domestic service  which  can  be\r\n\r\nshielded   from   global   competition   or   from    the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong highlighted the competition across\r\n\r\nthe  Causeway in healthcare services.  I am not sure that\r\n\r\nI  would go across to another country if I needed a heart\r\n\r\noperation, but if I need a haircut, if I want to do  some\r\n\r\nshopping, or entertainment, the facilities are there,  it\r\n\r\nis  cheaper,  why not?  Many Singaporeans do.   Even  for\r\n\r\nbridal  shops  and retail outlets, there is  competition.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  not possible to have a protected  inefficient\r\n\r\ndomestic  sector in Singapore.  We have to  be  efficient\r\n\r\neverywhere,  and  we have to look after  our  people  who\r\n\r\ncannot find jobs and help them to find jobs, which brings\r\n\r\nme to the question of structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs raised this - Dr Ong Seh Hong, Mr Zainul\r\n\r\nAbidin  and Dr Warren Lee.  It is a difficult problem  to\r\n\r\nsolve.   It  will  not disappear for quite  a  long  time\r\n\r\nbecause  if  you look at the figures, for  workers  50-59\r\n\r\nyears  old,  more  than  half have  less  than  secondary\r\n\r\nqualifications. For the younger workers, the  educational\r\n\r\nstandards are higher. But even for the younger age group,\r\n\r\naged  40-44  years old, about one-third  have  less  than\r\n\r\nsecondary qualifications, and they are going to be in the\r\n\r\nworkforce  for another 20 years.  So the Government  will\r\n\r\ngo the extra mile to help these older workers.  This will\r\n\r\nbe  one  major focus of the new Continuing Education  and\r\n\r\nTraining statutory board.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThese workers have contributed to the nation's growth and\r\n\r\nthey have made possible what Singapore is today.  Like in\r\n\r\nthe PSA retrenchment exercise, we will do all that we can\r\n\r\nto  help  the displaced workers, counsel them, help  them\r\n\r\nwith job search and with job matching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee and a few other MPs also asked us to\r\n\r\nsubsidise older workers.  They define older workers as 40\r\n\r\nyears and above - that is a generous definition.  It is a\r\n\r\npossible approach, but we do not have to consider it yet.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of older workers suffering from structural\r\n\r\nunemployment is still low, only 11/2%.  We should try  to\r\n\r\nsolve the problem for this specific group of people  with\r\n\r\ntargeted assistance, and not through some broad policy to\r\n\r\nsubsidise many other older workers who are still managing\r\n\r\nwell  on  their  own.  Otherwise, you  will  incur  great\r\n\r\nexpense  and yet miss the target.  Furthermore, you  will\r\n\r\ndistort  the  economy  and  end  up  with  deficits   and\r\n\r\ninefficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach, as a Government, is a three-level one.\r\n\r\nFirstly, generate good growth and create new jobs.  There\r\n\r\nare  jobs available if the older workers are flexible and\r\n\r\nprepared  to  adapt.  Even in the wafer fabs,  there  are\r\n\r\nsemi-skilled jobs, but they will require a certain amount\r\n\r\nof discipline, adjustment or shift work.  It is not easy,\r\n\r\nbut it can be done.  Secondly, help to educate, train and\r\n\r\nmatch workers to jobs so that they can stay employed,  or\r\n\r\nif  they lose jobs, then they can find new ones.  That is\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of  the new statutory board  and  also  the\r\n\r\nPeople for Jobs Training programme.  Also, we need to set\r\n\r\nup  the  right networks at the grassroots, the CDCs,  the\r\n\r\nself-help  groups  and NTUC, to help workers  find  jobs.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the Government will continue to provide targeted\r\n\r\nassistance  to  those who need help the most.   But  such\r\n\r\nassistance  must be tied to their efforts to  find  jobs.\r\n\r\nThe   Government  will  also  look  after   the   younger\r\n\r\ngenerations  to  make sure that no child is  deprived  of\r\n\r\ngood  education because of lack of finances.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nproblem,  because  if it is too easily available,  people\r\n\r\nwill not look for the jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Australia a year ago and I visited a\r\n\r\nvillage  about  50 miles outside of the  Gold  Coast.   I\r\n\r\nasked  the  guide,  \"Who  live  here?\"   He  said,  \"Some\r\n\r\nteachers,  some retired people, some unemployed  people.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Why are they living here, 50 miles away from the\r\n\r\nGold  Coast?   There  are no jobs.\"  He  said,  \"Exactly,\r\n\r\nbecause there is a rule in Australia that if you want the\r\n\r\ndole,  you must show that you have hunted for work within\r\n\r\na certain radius, 30-50 miles, and failed.\"  And this was\r\n\r\na  good  place  for  failing.  So, we  have  to  be  very\r\n\r\ncareful.  In Singapore, there is no place to go,  and  if\r\n\r\nthey do not try, you are going to have a problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have objected that many of the jobs\r\n\r\nbeing  created  are for younger, better-skilled  workers.\r\n\r\nThat  is  true.  But it is important that  we  do  create\r\n\r\nthese jobs and generate the growth.  With growth, we will\r\n\r\nhave  more  resources  to help the  older  workers.  With\r\n\r\ngrowth,  there  will  be some more  jobs  for  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers.   If  we  try  to preserve the  status  quo,  to\r\n\r\nprotect the jobs which are no longer viable, and  to  put\r\n\r\noff economic restructuring, then we will fail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have set as our objective here and as our theme\r\n\r\n\"New Challenges - Fresh Goals\".  Some people have accused\r\n\r\nus  of doing too little.  Some people have accused us  of\r\n\r\nmoving too fast.  MPs like Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Leong\r\n\r\nHorn  Kee have said that changes are not radical  enough,\r\n\r\nand  more  could have been done.  We have left  no  stone\r\n\r\nunturned.   We  decided where we needed to  make  radical\r\n\r\nchanges,  where modifications are needed,  and  where  we\r\n\r\nshould  leave things as they are, at least for  the  time\r\n\r\nbeing.   The changes are more significant than they  look\r\n\r\nbecause we have deliberately prepared people for them and\r\n\r\nintroduced  them carefully.  It was our  purpose  not  to\r\n\r\nshock  people.  If you are astonished, if you are amazed,\r\n\r\nif  you are not prepared, that means we have not done our\r\n\r\njob well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are big changes - tax structure, committed to\r\n\r\nreduce  the corporate and top personal tax rate  to  20%;\r\n\r\nbroaden  the tax base with the increase in the goods  and\r\n\r\nservices tax.  The CPF system - to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmake  significant shifts, to balance our retirement needs\r\n\r\nand  maintain labour market flexibility and  to  lay  the\r\n\r\nfoundation  for  changes to be phased in gradually.   And\r\n\r\nland  -  to  lay  down the principle  to  maximise  value\r\n\r\ncreation  from our land resources as well as to keep  the\r\n\r\ncost   of   land  competitive.   So,  we  have   done   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  amount, but maybe we still  have  not  gone\r\n\r\nfast enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people, however, have found the changes\r\n\r\nunsettling  and  the pace too fast.  Some  union  leaders\r\n\r\nhave  told  me, \"Why do we have to move so  quickly?   My\r\n\r\nmembers  cannot  catch  up.\"   We  are  making  so   many\r\n\r\ninitiatives.  They have not even read about them  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  But, in fact, maybe we need to go faster, as\r\n\r\nthe  world  is  changing quickly and our competitors  are\r\n\r\nforging ahead.  As Khaw Boon Wan pointed out, we have  to\r\n\r\nmove  faster than China and the other emerging economies.\r\n\r\nIt would be even more painful later if change is not done\r\n\r\nsoon  enough.   Therefore, everyone has  to  put  in  the\r\n\r\neffort  to  adjust,  adapt and venture  so  that  we  can\r\n\r\nprogress  as  a  nation.  The Government will  guide  and\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the structural shifts we need  to  make,  but\r\n\r\nsuccess  ultimately  depends on the  resourcefulness  and\r\n\r\nresilience of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are on the right track. The ERC recommendations\r\n\r\nare  the  result of the collective effort  of  many  good\r\n\r\nminds  committed to Singapore.  We cannot control  events\r\n\r\nin the short term and we may have to make tactical shifts\r\n\r\nalong the way, but the strategic thrusts are correct and,\r\n\r\nin   time,   they  will  generate  growth  and  transform\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked what is the difference\r\n\r\nbetween the 1986 Economic Committee and today's ERC.  The\r\n\r\nworld  has changed and so has Singapore.  Those were  the\r\n\r\ndays  before  the Internet and biotech.  Those  were  the\r\n\r\ndays  before  China and India joined the  global  economy\r\n\r\nwith   their   low  labour  cost  and  highly   motivated\r\n\r\nworkforces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our per capita income has more than\r\n\r\ndoubled  from  $14,000 in 1985 to $37,000 in  2001.   Our\r\n\r\nstandards of living\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  improved  substantially for the  vast  majority  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Yes, we are tightening our  belts.   But,\r\n\r\ncompared  to  1985, the last recession, in fact,  we  are\r\n\r\nmuch better off.  Most significantly, the quality of  our\r\n\r\nhousing  has  improved.  Then, we had  41,000  households\r\n\r\nliving in 5-room flats.  Now, we have 194,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education level of our workforce has gone up.\r\n\r\nThen,  graduates  were 5% of our workforce.   Today,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  has more than trebled to 17%.  So, the world  has\r\n\r\nchanged, and Singapore has changed too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Committee's recommendations in 1986\r\n\r\nlaid  the  basis for more than a decade of growth,  which\r\n\r\nended with the Asian crisis.  And this ERC Report in 2003\r\n\r\naims  to  chart the way forward over the next  decade  of\r\n\r\nintense global competition and knowledge driven growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we progress together, we will run into some old\r\n\r\nchallenges   in  new  forms,  like  cost  competitiveness\r\n\r\nissues.   We will also meet totally new challenges,  like\r\n\r\nthe  emergence of China and India, the explosion  of  the\r\n\r\nInternet  or  the  threat  of extremist  terrorism.   The\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  competition facing us  today  are  much\r\n\r\ntougher  than before, but we are also much stronger  than\r\n\r\nwe used to be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will be pro-jobs. We will help to\r\n\r\ncreate jobs, more jobs, better jobs.  We will help  train\r\n\r\nworkers for the new jobs.  The civil service will be even\r\n\r\nmore   pro-business.   There  will  be  more   help   for\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs to navigate the way through the  Government\r\n\r\nagencies,  and to take off on their own.  We  will  bring\r\n\r\nalong  all Singaporeans on this journey.  Nobody will  be\r\n\r\nleft  behind.  Those who can must help themselves.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  cannot, who will be few, will be the focus of  help.\r\n\r\nAbove  all, we will be pro-Singaporeans, because this  is\r\n\r\nour home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tough minds, warm hearts, strong spirits. With\r\n\r\nthese,  we can look forward to a bright future where  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   share  in  the  fruits  of  our   success.\r\n\r\nTogether  as  a  nation, we will realise  our  vision  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  becoming a leading global and  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\ncity, one of the best places\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  Asia, and indeed in the world, in which we can  live,\r\n\r\nwork and grow.

Or perhaps people living in Ang\r\n\r\nMo  Kio GRC are much richer and do not ask for help,  and\r\n\r\nthereby he is not aware of the problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,\r\n\r\nthe CPI is an average for the whole economy, covering all\r\n\r\nincome  groups.   But  we  also  have  figures  for   the\r\n\r\ndifferent income groups.  So, if incomes have gone  down,\r\n\r\nyou  can  see how different groups have been affected  in\r\n\r\nterms of cost of living.  Do things cost more? The answer\r\n\r\nis  that  things  do  not  cost  more.   There  are  some\r\n\r\nvariations, maybe +1%, maybe -1%.  But on the whole,  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  living for all income groups in  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nremained very stable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I fully acknowledge that times are\r\n\r\ndifficult,  that  we  have  to tighten  our  belts,  that\r\n\r\nincomes are down, bonuses are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndown.   And,  in some cases, net wealth is down,  because\r\n\r\nyour  property has gone down in value and you feel poorer\r\n\r\neven if you have not sold the property.  But that is  not\r\n\r\nthe same as saying that the cost of living has gone up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I have cases, like any other MP, where\r\n\r\npeople  come  and look for help.  Maybe I get  more  than\r\n\r\nother  MPs, because they think that if they come  to  me,\r\n\r\nthey  may get a bit more help.  But as I explained in  my\r\n\r\nspeech,  we will help them.  But the way to help them  is\r\n\r\nnot  for Singapore Power to forgive their utility  bills.\r\n\r\nIt  is  for  the  CCCs, the CDCs, to get  to  know  them,\r\n\r\nunderstand  their  problems, find out  why  they  have  a\r\n\r\nproblem, and if they deserve help, to give help.  But  if\r\n\r\nthey  do not deserve help, then you have to tell them  to\r\n\r\nlook after themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if somebody comes and says, \"I can't\r\n\r\npay  my  utility  bills\", and it turns  out  he  owns  an\r\n\r\nairconditioner.    You  tell  him   to   turn   off   the\r\n\r\nairconditioner and he says, \"I only turn it on  for  four\r\n\r\nhours  a night.\"  And he has a handphone.  How much  help\r\n\r\nshould I give him?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if a woman comes along - she has\r\n\r\ntried  her  best and the husband is not there,   she  has\r\n\r\nchildren and they are studying and trying their  best  in\r\n\r\nschool   -   then I will go the extra mile to help  them.\r\n\r\nSo,  I  think we need that sensitivity and not just  make\r\n\r\npolitical  capital in order to collect selfish  political\r\n\r\ndividends from people's sufferings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment for the financial year 1st April, 2003 to 31st\r\n\r\nMarch, 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Wong Kan\r\n\r\nSeng].\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Eighteen minutes to Five o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030312/20030312-HA-0760547.htm\">Committee of Supply - Estimates of Expenditure for the Financial Year 1st April 2003 to 31st March 2004(Cols. 547-552)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
