W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, section 33 of the\r\n\r\nMoneylenders Ordinance provides that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any moneylender, who, either personally or by any\r\n\r\nperson  acting  on his behalf, harasses or  intimidates\r\n\r\nhis debtor or any member of the debtor's family at,  or\r\n\r\nwatches or besets the residence or place of business or\r\n\r\nemployment  of the debtor, or any place  at  which  the\r\n\r\ndebtor receives his wages or any other sum periodically\r\n\r\ndue to him, shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be\r\n\r\nliable  on  conviction  to a  fine  not  exceeding  two\r\n\r\nhundred  and  fifty dollars, or to imprisonment  for  a\r\n\r\nterm  not  exceeding three months or to both such  fine\r\n\r\nand imprisonment:'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  am  not  satisfied  that the intention  behind  this\r\n\r\nsection  has  been  achieved. A successful  prosecution\r\n\r\nunder  this  section would require the debtor  to  give\r\n\r\nevidence  that  he has been harassed or intimidated  or\r\n\r\nthat  his  residence has been besetted  by  a  specific\r\n\r\nmoneylender.  Unfortunately,  it  would   appear   that\r\n\r\ndebtors  are  reluctant to come forward  with  specific\r\n\r\ncomplaints.  Since  the  coming  into  force   of   the\r\n\r\nMoneylenders Ordinance on the 11th of September,  1959,\r\n\r\nthere  has  not been one single instance of a  specific\r\n\r\ncomplaint  to  the  Registrar of  Moneylenders  by  any\r\n\r\ndebtor  to  enable a prosecution to be  launched  under\r\n\r\nthis  section  of  the  Ordinance.  Amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nMoneylenders    Ordinance   are   at   present    under\r\n\r\nconsideration. One suggestion has been to amend section\r\n\r\n33  to  make  the offence a seizable one.  This  is  to\r\n\r\nenable  any  registered moneylenders seen loitering  at\r\n\r\ndoorways  of  Government  departments  and  offices  of\r\n\r\nstatutory boards and other commercial organisations  to\r\n\r\nbe  arrested on the spot on the presumption  that  they\r\n\r\nare  there  for  the purpose of committing  an  offence\r\n\r\nunder   this  section.  However,  it  would  still   be\r\n\r\nnecessary  for debtors to come forth with  evidence  if\r\n\r\nconvictions are to be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> A supplementary\r\n\r\nquestion,  Sir,It  is  not because  the  debtors  are\r\n\r\nreluctant  to  come forward to give  evidence.  In  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  General Orders, there is a provision  which\r\n\r\nprohibits  civil servants from getting themselves  into\r\n\r\ndebt.  But  it is an open secret today that many  civil\r\n\r\nservants are indebted. They are harassed by the  money-lenders  and dare not make a report. Once they  make  a\r\n\r\nreport, they themselves will get into trouble. If the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  can do something about General  Order  158,\r\n\r\nprobably  the debtors will dare come forward  and  give\r\n\r\nevidence.  Is  the  Government  prepared  to  amend  or\r\n\r\nwithdraw General Order 158?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is more a matter for the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance than the Minister for Law. But, Mr Barker,\r\n\r\ndo you wish to answer that question?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that, as you have put\r\n\r\nit,   is  another  question.  Some  years  ago,  if   I\r\n\r\nunderstand the position right, all civil servants  were\r\n\r\ngiven  the opportunity to declare what debts they  had.\r\n\r\nAfter that, they were not supposed to borrow again.  If\r\n\r\na  civil  servant,  after  declaring  his  debts,  gets\r\n\r\nfurther  into debt, then he has only himself to  blame.\r\n\r\nBut whether or not the relevant Government Order should\r\n\r\nor  should not be revoked is surely a matter  which  is\r\n\r\nconfined only to civil servants. As far as the  general\r\n\r\npublic  is  concerned, there should be  no  fear  about\r\n\r\nmaking  complaints against money-lenders. But  not  one\r\n\r\nother  debtor  -  by other debtor I  mean  a  non-civil\r\n\r\nservant - has made any complaint since 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES FOR 1967</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply\r\n\r\n[Allotted Day].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

In this respect, the Prime Minister said  at  a\r\n\r\nfunction in connection with Nanyang University on  29th\r\n\r\nOctober,. 1966, that our country needs to produce a new\r\n\r\ngeneration which is well-educated, with a knowledge  of\r\n\r\nthe  cultural  background of  the  various  races,  and\r\n\r\nskilled   in  various  ways  in  order  to   meet   the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  our  national  production  -  meaning\r\n\r\npeople   with  the  technical  know-how  -   and   that\r\n\r\nUniversity  students  are the  future  leaders  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety. Therefore, the task of University students  is\r\n\r\nvery  great  indeed. In the past, they only thought  in\r\n\r\nterms  of themselves, but now they have to change their\r\n\r\nattitude. At present, they should think in terms of the\r\n\r\nfuture  of  the country. They should realise  that  the\r\n\r\ncountry  has  spent  a  great sum  of  money  on  their\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, they owe a debt to the nation. Once they\r\n\r\nhave   learnt   something,  they  should  place   their\r\n\r\nknowledge  and ability at the service of  the  country.\r\n\r\nRecently  there  have  been many incidents  in  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Before we started today's\r\n\r\nproceedings,  I  told  Members  that  we  are  on   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates  and  that  the  matters  to  be\r\n\r\ndebated  are  Government's  proposals  for  development\r\n\r\nunder  the various heads and subheads. Although we  are\r\n\r\nnow on the Ministry of Education, I do not think it  is\r\n\r\nproper  at this stage to talk about the past activities\r\n\r\nof students. So I would ask the Member for Sembawang to\r\n\r\ntry  to  relate  his remarks to matters of  development\r\n\r\nrather  than  the  ordinary day-to-day  policy  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education or in the  various  educational\r\n\r\nestablishments?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwill not give too many details on what I have said. Let\r\n\r\nme  now return to the Adult Education Board. Since last\r\n\r\nyear  the development of adult education has had  great\r\n\r\nsuccess.  There are more than 60,000 students attending\r\n\r\nadult   education  classes.  This  is  really  a  great\r\n\r\nachievement   in  the  eradication  of  illiteracy   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So I feel that the setting up of  an  Adult\r\n\r\nEducation  Centre is very necessary and appropriate  at\r\n\r\nthis  juncture and that after it has been set  up,  the\r\n\r\nAdult Education Board will be better able to carry  out\r\n\r\nits  work  and  we  can  score  total  success  in  the\r\n\r\neradication of illiteracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to touch on educational T.V. This is\r\n\r\nan  attempt  to try out a new medium of instruction  in\r\n\r\nour  country.  According  to the  experience  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries, educational T.V. has achieved great results.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask whether the department  concerned\r\n\r\nhas  any  concrete plan to carry out educational  T.V.,\r\n\r\nwhat   languages  will  he  used  as   the   media   of\r\n\r\ninstruction,  and  what will be the  contents  of  such\r\n\r\neducation. I hope the Minister can give details to this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to touch on the Physical Education\r\n\r\nCentre.

Let me  now\r\n\r\ntalk  in general terms. The Minister seems to know  too\r\n\r\nlittle about what I have asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask some questions relating to the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of a Physical Education Centre. I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister can give this House some information.  I  have\r\n\r\nsome suggestions to make also. Firstly, we must have  a\r\n\r\nconcrete  plan  and there should also be  a  realistic,\r\n\r\npolicy. In addition to the setting up of the Centre, we\r\n\r\nshould  also  have plans to produce  a  set  number  of\r\n\r\nsportsmen every year. Secondly, we should have  capable\r\n\r\nand experienced people as coaches and other officers in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  the Physical Education Centre.  Thirdly,  a\r\n\r\npractical  programme  should be  mapped  out  to  train\r\n\r\nschool  boys and school girls, especially during  their\r\n\r\nvacation,  in order to produce more able sportsmen  and\r\n\r\nsportswomen.  From  the results of our  performance  in\r\n\r\ninternational  games, our standard is too  poor  and  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister can pay attention to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  am  indeed  pleased  with  the  keen\r\n\r\ninterest   shown  by  the  Member  for   Sembawang   in\r\n\r\neducational  matters. In fact, I agree with  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nwhat  he has said and I can assure him that my Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  be doing its best in the coming year when we will\r\n\r\nbe  shifting the emphasis from quantity to  quality  in\r\n\r\nthe educational field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the supply of doctors from the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore is inadequate to meet the needs\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. It is for this reason that the expansion\r\n\r\nprogramme  in  respect of the University  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill be reviewed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  reconsidered. In fact, earlier this month  I  have\r\n\r\nalready    informed   the   University   of   Singapore\r\n\r\nauthorities that they must plan for an output of  about\r\n\r\nthree  times  the  present number of doctors  from  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  to meet the needs of Singapore as  well  as\r\n\r\nother places. So I think that aspect of the problem  is\r\n\r\nwell  in  hand,  but  the Member for  Sembawang  should\r\n\r\nrealise  that it takes six years to produce  a  doctor.\r\n\r\nUntil then a certain shortage will still be there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Department of Civil Aviation, there is no\r\n\r\nplan  yet at the moment to create such a department  in\r\n\r\nthe  University  of  Singapore. There  is,  however,  a\r\n\r\nproposal  to set up a separate Technological University\r\n\r\nsometime  in the future, and I think this subject  will\r\n\r\nbe   more  appropriate  for  the  future  Technological\r\n\r\nUniversity to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to set up an Adult Education Centre is\r\n\r\nstill under consideration. However, this does not  mean\r\n\r\nthat the adult education classes currently carried  out\r\n\r\nin  the various schools will be affected. I agree  with\r\n\r\nhim that an Adult Education Centre is very necessary to\r\n\r\nenable  the  Adult  Education Board  to  function  more\r\n\r\nefficiently  and  effectively. However,  the  financial\r\n\r\nposition of the State is such that this project has  to\r\n\r\nbe reconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as educational television is concerned, if the\r\n\r\nMember for Sembawang was present when the Supplementary\r\n\r\nEstimates  for  this  subject were  discussed  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, he would not have raised that question just now.\r\n\r\nBut  for  his benefit I might as well tell him  briefly\r\n\r\nthat  the  languages to be used by the E.T.V, will  be\r\n\r\nEnglish  and Chinese in the first instance for  obvious\r\n\r\nreasons, and that the subjects offered will be  English\r\n\r\nlanguage, Chinese as a second language, Mathematics and\r\n\r\nScience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Physical Education Centre is to replace\r\n\r\nthe   temporary  accommodation  now  provided  for  the\r\n\r\nPhysical   Education  Inspectorate  at   the   National\r\n\r\nRecreation Centre in Kallang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  agree  with  the  Member that we  should  have  more\r\n\r\nspecialists,  P.E. instructors  to  train  more   P.E.\r\n\r\nteachers for schools, and that students who are good in\r\n\r\nP.E. should be properly coached so that in time to come\r\n\r\nthey  can  take  part in international competitions.  I\r\n\r\nthink  a  plan  is  afoot  to create  a  Department  of\r\n\r\nPhysical Education at the Teachers' Training College to\r\n\r\ntrain teachers for the schools, and I hope that as soon\r\n\r\nas  finances are available this Department of  Physical\r\n\r\nEducation will be set up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  take  this opportunity to ask a  question  in\r\n\r\nconnection   with   the   Development   Estimates   for\r\n\r\neducation,  namely,  the  expenditure  on   Works   and\r\n\r\nBuildings  for Nanyang University. Are there  some  new\r\n\r\nbuildings  to be put up by the Government  for  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity, or is the money required for the completion\r\n\r\nof existing works?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point also concerns the buildings at Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity. I would like to know whether there  is  any\r\n\r\nlong-term  plan for the building of Nanyang University.\r\n\r\nI  do not want to criticise the past, but I will try to\r\n\r\nrelate  the  present and the future with the  past.  We\r\n\r\ncould  draw  a  lesson  from past mistakes.  There  are\r\n\r\ncertain  circumstances  which are  not  very  ideal  in\r\n\r\nrespect of certain buildings at Nanyang University. The\r\n\r\nNanyang  University Library was not built on  a  proper\r\n\r\nbasis.  A  big hall was built. Later on some classrooms\r\n\r\nwere built and it was found that they were too small so\r\n\r\nthat  the  walls separating the classrooms  had  to  be\r\n\r\nbroken  down in order to have bigger classrooms.  These\r\n\r\nare past mistakes.

However,   because   of   the\r\n\r\nrestricted  site,  a multi-storey building  had  to  be\r\n\r\ndesigned.

Where is he going to build the new\r\n\r\nsecondary and vocational schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to add certain comments on\r\n\r\nthis  item. According to present plans, the  siting  of\r\n\r\nschools is concentrated in certain areas. For instance,\r\n\r\nin  the Mountbatten Constituency there are no less than\r\n\r\n20  to  30  schools. The allocation of  the  sites  for\r\n\r\nschools  is  not  equitable.  Students  living  in  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring  constituencies have to pay for  transport\r\n\r\nto go to the schools in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is that there are too few schools\r\n\r\nin the rural areas. For example, in my own constituency\r\n\r\nof  Sembawang, there are too few schools. I would  like\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to pay attention to this matter. I  would\r\n\r\nalso  like  to ask whether Sembawang or Nee  Soon  will\r\n\r\nhave  any secondary schools or vocational schools under\r\n\r\nthe development plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is this. According to the present\r\n\r\npolicy,  only  two years' training will be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nstudents  in  the secondary vocational  schools.  After\r\n\r\nthis, they will have to leave school regardless of  the\r\n\r\nresult.  But  we must not forget that, on the  average,\r\n\r\nthe age of the students is about 16 years. So how do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou  expect  16-year old boys to get  employment  after\r\n\r\nleaving  school?  I  would like  to  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he is prepared to extend vocational  education\r\n\r\nby  one  year. The students will thus have three years'\r\n\r\nvocational  education so that when  they  leave  school\r\n\r\nthey will reach the age of 18. This is a better age for\r\n\r\nseeking   employment.   This  will   give   them   more\r\n\r\nopportunity in competing in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd.

The first  point  has  some\r\n\r\nsimilarity  to the suggestion given by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang. However, he is a little selfish, because  he\r\n\r\nonly  wants a school for his own Sembawang area.  I  am\r\n\r\nputting myself on a different footing. The first  point\r\n\r\nis  that  I would like the Minister to tell this  House\r\n\r\nwhether he has paid any attention to the development of\r\n\r\nschools  in the rural areas. I believe if we have  more\r\n\r\nsecondary schools in the rural areas, then this will go\r\n\r\na  long way towards raising the educational standard of\r\n\r\nthe  rural people. At the same time, it will go a  step\r\n\r\nfurther  towards implementing a very important item  in\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. manifesto  which  aims  at  raising   the\r\n\r\neducational standard of the rural people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this. I would like to know what\r\n\r\nplans  are being proposed to build halls and gymnasiums\r\n\r\nin  the new schools, and whether extensive use of  such\r\n\r\nplaces  in  the school buildings will be made.  I  have\r\n\r\nrecently  visited several school halls. They  all  look\r\n\r\nvery  grand.  But in practice they are not  very  good.\r\n\r\nThey are very expensive. Some cost about $400,000 each.\r\n\r\nThey are only good for show but are of not much use  in\r\n\r\npractice.  In  some  cases, they  are  not  useful  for\r\n\r\nsports,  because the ceilings are too low or  the  hall\r\n\r\nlengths  are inadequate for their purposes.

For next  year\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools  are proposed to  be  built  at  the\r\n\r\nfollowing sites:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n              (1) Chestnut Drive, \r\n\r\n                      which is in the rural area.\r\n\r\n              (2) Junction of Crescent and Dun-man Roads.\r\n\r\n              (3) Linden  Drive,  \r\n\r\n                      I think, is also  in  the  rural area.\r\n\r\n              (4) Lowland Road, \r\n\r\n                      also in the rural area.\r\n\r\n              (5) Jalan Bukit Merah.\r\n\r\n              (6) Junction of Sennet and Upper East Coast Roads, \r\n\r\n                      which is also in the rural area.\r\n\r\n              (7) Toa Payoh - \r\n\r\n                      I am not certain whether it is going to be rural or urban now.\r\n\r\n              (8) Mount Vernon, \r\n\r\n                      which is another rural area.\r\n\r\n              (9) Jalan Hwi Yoh, \r\n\r\n                      another rural area.\r\n\r\n             (10) Tiong Bahru sewerage site.\r\n\r\n             (11) Tiong Bahru fire site.\r\n\r\n             (12) Changi Road 6\u00be m.s., \r\n\r\n                      another rural area.\r\n\r\n             (13) Toa Payoh.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n             (14) Whitley Road.\r\n\r\n             (15) Queenstown.  \r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>From  the  list of school sites that have been approved\r\n\r\nfor  next year, Mr Speaker, Sir, you will notice  that\r\n\r\nmost  of  the  schools, in fact, will be sited  in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are no plans for the building of\r\n\r\nsecondary schools in the Sembawang area in 1967,  there\r\n\r\nis  a  proposal to convert the existing Naval Base Full\r\n\r\nSchool into a secondary school and for extensions to be\r\n\r\nbuilt  to  enable the school to increase the  secondary\r\n\r\nschool enrolment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that education in the present secondary\r\n\r\nvocational  schools lasts for two years only  and  that\r\n\r\nthe  students will have to leave at the end of  a  two-year  course.  But  the  Member  for  Sembawang  should\r\n\r\nrealise  that  our present minimum school-leaving  age,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  16, is one of the highest in the  world.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  in the United Kingdom the minimum school-leaving\r\n\r\nage  is  15.  While everybody would like to keep  their\r\n\r\nchildren in school for as long as possible, I think  it\r\n\r\nis  just  financially not possible to raise the school-leaving age to 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Paya Lebar that our\r\n\r\nschool halls should be designed for multi purposes.  In\r\n\r\nfact, the new school halls are so designed, apart  from\r\n\r\ngymnastic equipment provided for in the new halls, that\r\n\r\nmany other indoor games can also be played in the halls\r\n\r\ne.g., badminton, sepak raga -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Sir, under this head the vote is\r\n\r\n$580,020  for the development mainly of the  Queenstown\r\n\r\nVocational  Institute.  At the  present  juncture,  our\r\n\r\ncountry  is  industrialising  quite  progressively  and\r\n\r\nsuccessfully.  So  we require, as a matter  of  course,\r\n\r\nmore technical personnel for our industrial growth  and\r\n\r\nto  man  our factories. But the vote for next  year  is\r\n\r\nonly  $580,020.  I would like to ask the  Minister  why\r\n\r\nonly a small vote is asked for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is this.

It is envisaged that not all the work can\r\n\r\nbe  completed this year and, therefore, a provision  of\r\n\r\n$300,000 only is entered in the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the Jurong Vocational Institute of\r\n\r\nEngineering and the Queenstown Vocational Institute of\r\n\r\nManual and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplied  Arts  are  concerned, they are  still  in  the\r\n\r\nplanning  stage.  It  is  not expected  that  extensive\r\n\r\nconstruction work can be carried out by the end of next\r\n\r\nyear.  Therefore, only $100,000 has been  provided  for\r\n\r\neach of these institutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that there are vacancies in our secondary\r\n\r\ntechnical schools, for the simple reason that technical\r\n\r\neducation  is  something  new  and  parents  are  still\r\n\r\nreluctant  to choose secondary technical education  for\r\n\r\ntheir children. However, from the trend in the past few\r\n\r\nyears,  I  think  we  can foresee that  more  and  more\r\n\r\nparents will in future send their children to technical\r\n\r\nschools.  Of  course, it is possible to  fill  all  the\r\n\r\nvacancies  in  the technical schools  by  refusing  the\r\n\r\nparents  any choice. We can do so quite simply by  just\r\n\r\nchannelling  students to technical schools or  academic\r\n\r\ntype  of schools or commercial schools as we think fit.\r\n\r\nIt  is  possible that we may come to that stage if  the\r\n\r\nresponse  from  the parents to send their  children  to\r\n\r\ntechnical  schools  is  not  forthcoming.  But  I   can\r\n\r\nanticipate  that when we decide for the parents,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be considerable criticism and resistance.

So that I do have to pay great attention to  what\r\n\r\nhe has to say on medicine and medical progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Joo Chiat is also,\r\n\r\nfortunately, an honorary consultant to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth,  besides  being the President  of  the  Medical\r\n\r\nCouncil.  So  I  am speaking to one  who  is  really  a\r\n\r\nspecialist  in  his  field and I am  just  an  ordinary\r\n\r\nlayman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in full sympathy with most of his remarks, but I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  give a little background  on  how  the\r\n\r\nInstitute of Medical Specialities came to be born.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Joo Chiat has rightly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npointed out that he is all in support of the speciality\r\n\r\nof Radiotherapy Isotope Centre. It was actually part of\r\n\r\nGovernment's plan to establish this centre. In fact, it\r\n\r\nhas  been so for a number of years. It was in the First\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan for 1960-64, but, unfortunately,  for\r\n\r\nsome  reason or other, it was not implemented,  but  we\r\n\r\ndid  intend to go ahead with it this year. We had a sum\r\n\r\nof  $1.7 million earmarked for the establishment  of  a\r\n\r\nnew Radiotherapy Centre, shall I put it that way, as we\r\n\r\ndo  have a very small and rather out-of-date centre  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment  which  is doing its best with  out-of-date\r\n\r\nequipment in the Outram Road General Hospital.  It  was\r\n\r\nthen  that  the  Medical Faculty of the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  were  thinking of what to do to  commemorate\r\n\r\ntheir Diamond Jubilee. I think they originally had  the\r\n\r\nidea  of a very modest extension to the medical library\r\n\r\nfor  a sum of about $700,000-odd, and they already  had\r\n\r\nin  hand a grant from the China Medical Board for  this\r\n\r\nparticular  project. They wanted to be  more  ambitious\r\n\r\nand  thought  that perhaps it was time to consider  the\r\n\r\nproject  of an Institute of Medical Specialities.  They\r\n\r\ntherefore held consultations with our Ministry so  that\r\n\r\ntheir  ideas  could be grafted on to  our  Radiotherapy\r\n\r\nIsotope Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were glad that the University was prepared to\r\n\r\ndiscuss matters of development with the Ministry.  This\r\n\r\nwas  a  great improvement compared to a few years  back\r\n\r\nwhen the University authorities thought they would just\r\n\r\ndraw  up a plan for development on their own. That  was\r\n\r\nin  1962 when they drew up a very ambitious plan of $40\r\n\r\nmillion,  half of which ($20 million) would  be  for  a\r\n\r\nTeaching  Hospital. But, unfortunately,  there  was  no\r\n\r\nprior  consultation between the University  and  either\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Health, so\r\n\r\nthat Government could not support this rather ambitious\r\n\r\nplan  of $40 million and I am afraid it did not have  a\r\n\r\nvery long life. They did try to go out on their own  to\r\n\r\nget funds, and they probably got less than one per cent\r\n\r\nof their target.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we had the University of Singapore authorities at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of 1964 coming for consultation with  us  and\r\n\r\nwanting  to  incorporate a number of specialities.  The\r\n\r\napproved  specialities were neurology and neurosurgery,\r\n\r\nkidney  diseases, and blood diseases,  genetics  and  a\r\n\r\npsychology  unit, gastro-enterology, endocrinology  and\r\n\r\nan intensive care unit. These were ultimately accepted,\r\n\r\nas  I  have  said, for grafting on top of our  proposed\r\n\r\nRadiotherapy  Isotope Centre. All in all,  it  came  to\r\n\r\njust  around  $4  million.  That  was  how  this  joint\r\n\r\nproject,  shall we say, was presented to the public  as\r\n\r\npart and parcel of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations  of\r\n\r\nthe  Medical  School in Singapore.  By  adding  on  the\r\n\r\nextension  to  the medical library of $\u00be  million,  the\r\n\r\njoint   target  for  the  Medical  Progress  Fund   was\r\n\r\ntherefore  $4.75 million, with the Government  agreeing\r\n\r\nto back this proposal dollar for dollar up to a maximum\r\n\r\nof $2 million for the Institute of Medical Specialities\r\n\r\nitself,  plus  another one-half of $\u00be million  for  the\r\n\r\nextension to the medical library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad to say that this project captured the\r\n\r\nimagination  of  the public in Singapore  so  that  the\r\n\r\nresponse  was  exceedingly good. The figure  ultimately\r\n\r\ndonated  or  pledged to be given to the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  for the Medical Progress Fund (some  of  the\r\n\r\namounts pledged are to be paid in instalments over a 3-year period) has exceeded its original target of $2.375\r\n\r\nmillion  for the University of Singapore. And  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Joo Chiat has mentioned that they  have\r\n\r\nactually got something like over $3 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say that the conception of the\r\n\r\nInstitute of Medical Specialities is really a  move  on\r\n\r\nthe  part of the University of Singapore to join  hands\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government in building something  which,  in\r\n\r\ntheir  view,  is necessary and which, in our  view,  is\r\n\r\nreally part and parcel of our own development. I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  sometimes necessary not to impose  Government's\r\n\r\nviews  too much on the University of Singapore  because\r\n\r\nwe  would like them to be able to let us know what they\r\n\r\nthink their development should be, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  we  would  give  them all the necessary  support,\r\n\r\nsometimes financially and sometimes morally.  From  the\r\n\r\npoint of view of Government then, we have moved on from\r\n\r\nhaving  to  provide the sum of $1.7 million  by  adding\r\n\r\nanother $600,000-odd to a sum of $2.3 million for  this\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of a separate Teaching Hospital for\r\n\r\nthe  University, I was originally of the view  that  it\r\n\r\nwas  not  necessary, because if our Medical School  has\r\n\r\ndone  so well with what it has, that is to say,  making\r\n\r\nfull  use of the facilities that are available  in  our\r\n\r\nOutram Road General Hospital for the last 60 years, the\r\n\r\nconception of a separate Teaching Hospital is something\r\n\r\nwhich  perhaps could be considered a luxury, especially\r\n\r\nif  one  is  presented with the idea  that  a  Teaching\r\n\r\nHospital  would  come  to as much  as  $20  million  as\r\n\r\nconceived by the University authorities in 1962. But if\r\n\r\nit were something more modest, then I think there would\r\n\r\nbe  great  advantages if there were a separate Teaching\r\n\r\nHospital,  because I am beginning to find that  in  the\r\n\r\nOutram  Road General Hospital we are having  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ncomplications  because the University  uses  Government\r\n\r\nfacilities.  The administration, the staff,  everything\r\n\r\nis Government. The University staff are just grafted on\r\n\r\nto  a Government department and they appear to have the\r\n\r\nbest of both worlds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it suits them, the University talk of research.\r\n\r\nBut there are service functions to be performed. So our\r\n\r\nGovernment   officials   of   doctors,   surgeons   and\r\n\r\nspecialists  who  work shoulder to  shoulder  with  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  officers always find that, for some  reason\r\n\r\nor  other,  the University staff always  appear  to  be\r\n\r\ngetting  the  best  of all worlds,  whether  it  is  in\r\n\r\nsalary,   perks,   leave  of  absence,   study   leave,\r\n\r\nconsultation  fees, holidays - a long string  of  perks - and the Government officials feel that they are always\r\n\r\nthe   worse  off.  I  think  that  is  not   good   for\r\n\r\nadministration or morale. But I am cheered to find that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\nthe  doctors  and  surgeons who are now  in  Government\r\n\r\nservice are of very good material and are holding their\r\n\r\nown with the University staff. For example, at the last\r\n\r\nSurgeons'  Seminar for the Asian Pacific Region,  which\r\n\r\nwas sponsored by the Academy of Medicine, there were as\r\n\r\nmany  Government  doctors who  were  taking  charge  of\r\n\r\nsessions as there were University officers. Whereas  in\r\n\r\nthe  past,  I  think  it used to be  led  generally  by\r\n\r\nUniversity  personnel. It has been one of my  functions\r\n\r\nduring  the  last  three  years  to  try  to  make  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  officials in the service  feel  proud  that\r\n\r\nthey are as good as the University staff in all fields.\r\n\r\nIt  so  happens that some of them are more academically\r\n\r\ninclined  and,  therefore, choose a University  career,\r\n\r\nwhereas  those who are in Government service are  doing\r\n\r\nan  excellent job in their posts. So I do  say  that  I\r\n\r\nhave  now come to the point where I think it is  highly\r\n\r\ndesirable that the University of Singapore ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> The  Chairman (Mr Lim Cheng Lock)</b>: May I  inform  the\r\n\r\nMinister that he has a minute more to wind up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Thank you, Sir,I am all in favour\r\n\r\nnow  that  the University of Singapore should have  its\r\n\r\nown  Teaching Hospital with its own teaching facilities\r\n\r\nand be responsible for administering and running it.

We know that  at  present  our\r\n\r\nGovernment has eleven different types of hospitals,  31\r\n\r\nclinics and 5 mobile clinics which are mainly to  serve\r\n\r\nthe  rural people. Because of the Government's  efforts\r\n\r\nin  this field, the health of the people has been  well\r\n\r\ntaken  care of. This can be said to be the good fortune\r\n\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this head I would like to ask the Minister two\r\n\r\nquestions.  Firstly,  when will  the  building  of  the\r\n\r\nInstitute of Medical Specialities be started  and  when\r\n\r\nwill  it  be  completed? What type of service  will  it\r\n\r\nprovide for our people? Secondly, about the training of\r\n\r\nnurses and the subjects to be taught. Will the subjects\r\n\r\ntaught  include courtesy? What will be the Government's\r\n\r\nplan  on  the subjects to be taught? I hope members  of\r\n\r\nthe public will be able to praise the nurses instead of\r\n\r\naccusing or criticising them for their bad attitude  as\r\n\r\nin the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I would like to know\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister for Health whether in the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  for  1967  there is  any  plan  to  build  a\r\n\r\nhospital in the eastern area near the Kampong Kembangan\r\n\r\nConstituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I would like to ask a question under  the\r\n\r\nvote   for   the  expansion  of  hospitals  and   other\r\n\r\nfacilities. Why could the vote not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  be used in the building of clinics? In the  past,\r\n\r\nwe  received replies from the Minister that he  had  no\r\n\r\nplans  to set up clinics in certain areas. I feel  that\r\n\r\nto  people  working in certain areas the  expansion  of\r\n\r\nclinics  and  medical services is  very  necessary  for\r\n\r\ntheir   convenience.  There  are  not  enough  clinical\r\n\r\nservices because the people in various places  are  not\r\n\r\nadequately  served  with clinics. The  Minister  should\r\n\r\nunderstand  that,  in  the  course  of  development  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  through  urban  renewal,  there  have   been\r\n\r\nconcentrations of population in certain areas  and  the\r\n\r\ndensity  of the population in the rural areas has  also\r\n\r\nincreased  accordingly.  The  answers  given   by   the\r\n\r\nMinister  in the past are not quite valid  now.  It  is\r\n\r\nwrong  to say that, because certain clinics are set  up\r\n\r\nin  some areas, so the people from other areas can also\r\n\r\ngo  to  them  to  get  medical treatment.  That  is  an\r\n\r\nincorrect conception. The Minister also gave a reply in\r\n\r\nsimilar  vein  to my query about postal  services  some\r\n\r\ntime  ago. Now the Minister's answer in respect of  the\r\n\r\nmedical  services is just the same. He says  there  are\r\n\r\nclinics  available,  just as he  answered  my  previous\r\n\r\nquery about postal services. The most densely populated\r\n\r\nareas are Queenstown, Tiong Bahru and Bukit Ho Swee. In\r\n\r\nthese  areas  at present the existing clinics  are  too\r\n\r\nsmall  to  give any efficient service. Yet our Minister\r\n\r\nthinks  that  they can still provide  services  to  our\r\n\r\npeople.  I myself have gone for on-the-spot inspections\r\n\r\nand  found that there used to be people queueing up and\r\n\r\nwaiting  to  be examined by the doctors. At  first  the\r\n\r\npeople  queueing  up  might  have  merely  some   minor\r\n\r\nillness,  but  when they were finally examined  by  the\r\n\r\ndoctors, their illness would have become more serious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I have some suggestions to make. I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  try to solve the present situation.  He\r\n\r\nhas  said that the main problem confronting the medical\r\n\r\nservices  is the shortage of doctors. Possibly  because\r\n\r\nof  this the services provided by the clinics are  also\r\n\r\naffected.  I  would like to ask him whether  there  are\r\n\r\nprivate doctors who are willing to spend some of  their\r\n\r\ntime to serve the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npatients.  If there are, is he willing to accept  their\r\n\r\noffer  of services? It seems that he has said  that  he\r\n\r\nwanted  to  accept such services, but that the  private\r\n\r\ndoctors  are  not  allowed to accept remuneration.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  should  not expect private  doctors  to  meet\r\n\r\nexpenses  out  of their own pocket. If  some  financial\r\n\r\nsolution  can  be found, then it will  be  possible  to\r\n\r\nsolve many problems confronting the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> May I, Mr Speaker, Sir, attempt\r\n\r\nto answer the Members in the order in which they spoke?\r\n\r\nFirstly,  the Member for Sembawang. I believe he  wants\r\n\r\ntwo   questions  answered:  firstly,  when   will   the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of Medical Specialities be built? It  should\r\n\r\nhave  been  built much earlier because  the  foundation\r\n\r\nceremony  was  performed  quite  some  time  ago.  But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, like most building projects, they always\r\n\r\nwant  new  additions and try to get new  ideas.  I  was\r\n\r\ntrying  to explain to the Member for Joo Chiat how  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of Medical Specialities came into being.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  nine-storey structure to be built on top of  our\r\n\r\nRadiotherapy Centre which will form the ground and  the\r\n\r\nfirst  few floors. Our Radiotherapist actually had  the\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  going round the world,  under  a  W.H.O.\r\n\r\nscholarship, to see various radiotherapy centres.  That\r\n\r\nis   a  good  idea  because  we  will  be  spending   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable sum of money, and if we can get  the  best\r\n\r\nideas  after visiting a few centres, then  we  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  keep abreast of scientific progress  and  not\r\n\r\nmake  mistakes  which were made by other  people.  Just\r\n\r\nwhen  I thought he had settled down, another offer came\r\n\r\nfrom  Australia and off again he went there for another\r\n\r\nfew  months, and so the matter was delayed. But I  hear\r\n\r\nthat piling will get started next month. So we are well\r\n\r\non  our  way  to  making some progress. I  believe  the\r\n\r\nMember for Sembawang also indicated what would be found\r\n\r\nin this institute and what it would provide for. I have\r\n\r\nindicated  just  now to the Member for  Joo  Chiat  the\r\n\r\nvarious  specialities, and if it is necessary,  I  will\r\n\r\nrepeat  again.  The units that will be housed  in  this\r\n\r\nInstitute of Medical Specialities will be radiotherapy,\r\n\r\ncardiology  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand cardiac surgery, neurology and neuro-surgery,\r\n\r\nunits  for kidney diseases and blood diseases; genetics\r\n\r\nand  psychology units, gastro-enterology, endocrinology\r\n\r\nand an intensive care unit after surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second question is in respect of the extension to\r\n\r\nour  Nurses' Training School in the Outram Road General\r\n\r\nHospital.  We  are  moving so  fast  and  expanding  so\r\n\r\nrapidly  that I think we must also expand our  training\r\n\r\nfacilities  for our nurses. With this extension,  which\r\n\r\nis  being provided for next year, we should be able  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  larger intake of nurses and train them ---  it\r\n\r\ntakes  three  years  to  train a  nurse  ---  and  also\r\n\r\nincrease our intake of students for this purpose.  Also\r\n\r\nfor  purposes of expansion as we are going to have more\r\n\r\nhospitals. I will have to defer going into that  a  bit\r\n\r\nin order to answer the other Members concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of courtesy for nurses, it is really\r\n\r\npart  and  parcel  of their training  to  be  kind  and\r\n\r\ncourteous. But everyone is human. We all say we want to\r\n\r\nbe   kind,   to  be  nice,  and  to  smile  under   all\r\n\r\ndifficulties;  but  being human  sometimes  we  do  not\r\n\r\nsmile. I do not think we can expect a hundred per  cent\r\n\r\nfrom   anyone.  I  think  we  will  be  expecting   the\r\n\r\nimpossible.  Of  course,  it  does  not  mean  that  we\r\n\r\ntolerate  rudeness and incivility from not only  nurses\r\n\r\nbut  anybody. If there is any complaint and it  can  be\r\n\r\nproved  that  they really go out of  their  way  to  be\r\n\r\nunkind   and   uncivil,  then  they  come   under   the\r\n\r\nDisciplinary  Code  and  disciplinary  action  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken,  sometimes with a strong verbal warning and,  if\r\n\r\nit  is being repeated, a written warning, and later  on\r\n\r\nperhaps  a stoppage of increment, and finally,  if  the\r\n\r\npeople are still impossible, then they get the sack. We\r\n\r\nexpect  all civil servants to show courtesy. But  there\r\n\r\nare sometimes extenuating circumstances and we have  to\r\n\r\nbe  reasonable. I think not all members of  the  public\r\n\r\nare angels either. Sometimes they demand the impossible\r\n\r\nand  we  have to be fair to our staff. If it can really\r\n\r\nbe proved that our staff\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  going to the limit, then I say they deserve to  be\r\n\r\nrapped.  But  I  am  not  prepared  just  to  jump   to\r\n\r\nconclusions  and  say  any  complaint  is  a  justified\r\n\r\ncomplaint. It has to be looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now come to the Member for Kampong Kembangan\r\n\r\nwho  is  interested  to know whether  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  has in mind the building of a hospital  on  the\r\n\r\neastern  side  of Singapore Island. Yes,  we  have  the\r\n\r\nintention  to build another hospital there.  It  should\r\n\r\nform  part of the Second Five-Year Plan, 1966 to  1970.\r\n\r\nThis  Second  Five-Year Plan has yet to  be  published.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this project is accepted as being part  of  the\r\n\r\nPlan. It might be built probably late in the sixties  -\r\n\r\n1968  or  1969. So I can assure the Member for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  that a hospital is coming up  there  and  it\r\n\r\nmight be a 700-bed hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally there was a site off Guillemard Road. But\r\n\r\nI understand we have been pushed out of there in favour\r\n\r\nof  another  Ministry, and so we are  now  looking  for\r\n\r\nanother site. There is a site available off Bedok - which\r\n\r\nis probably closer to Kampong Kembangan than if it were\r\n\r\nstationed in Guillemard Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the Member for Delta who still makes a\r\n\r\nplea   for   increasing   the  number   of   outpatient\r\n\r\ndispensaries. I think she keeps on reminding me that my\r\n\r\nanswers  are  all wrong and evidently her requests  are\r\n\r\nall  right, which is not the case. It is all very well,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, to say. \"We must have dispensaries to\r\n\r\nlook  after the poor people,\" and things like that.  We\r\n\r\nunderstand  all  these things, but we have  got  to  be\r\n\r\npractical. Here is a little island of 200 square  miles\r\n\r\nand a population of 2 million. There are 500 doctors in\r\n\r\nprivate   practice  all  over  the  island.  Government\r\n\r\nalready  has 26 outpatient dispensaries, some with  one\r\n\r\ndoctor,  some  with two doctors, some with  three,  and\r\n\r\nsome  even  with five, seven, or eight doctors  to  man\r\n\r\nthem.  This has tied up nearly 70 doctors to look after\r\n\r\n26\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutpatient  dispensaries and to  treat  common  coughs,\r\n\r\ncolds  and  tummy aches after dinner.  70  doctors  can\r\n\r\nstaff one good-sized hospital. So I say that as long as\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  have  as many doctors as we  want  in  our\r\n\r\nservice, the first need is for doctors to be posted  to\r\n\r\nhospitals  to deal with the acutely ill cases.  I  will\r\n\r\nkeep  on saying that, as long as I am the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth,  I  have  decided  to  stop  establishing   new\r\n\r\noutpatient dispensaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 22 of the Development Estimates, Sir, there\r\n\r\nis  a subhead, No. 201, which mentions a polyclinic  at\r\n\r\nPasir  Panjang.  I may appear to be talking  at  cross-purposes. The building of this polyclinic, which  is  a\r\n\r\ncombination of an outpatient dispensary and a  maternal\r\n\r\nchild  health  centre, is really something  that  I  am\r\n\r\nbuilding  in  order  to  close down  one  old-fashioned\r\n\r\noutpatient dispensary in Pasir Panjang, which is  in  a\r\n\r\nshop-house, and a maternal child health centre in Buona\r\n\r\nVista.  This  is where the National Training  Institute\r\n\r\nis.  In fact, the National Training Institute wants  to\r\n\r\ntake  over  this maternal child health centre  and  has\r\n\r\nasked  us to buzz off. I have said that I will  readily\r\n\r\ndo  so  if  I can find another place to move  over.  So\r\n\r\nsubhead 201 will be to build something in place of what\r\n\r\nis  now  available.  So there is  nothing  new  in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of another outpatient dispensary. And I say\r\n\r\nthat it will be a long time before we can consider  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  more  outpatient  dispensaries  when   we\r\n\r\nalready  have  26 outpatient dispensaries available  to\r\n\r\nthe people throughout the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards private doctors wanting to help in the\r\n\r\noutpatient  dispensaries, this  is  nothing  new,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  offer has always been a standing  one.  I\r\n\r\nthink we pay them something like $40 per session of two\r\n\r\nhours.  We have a few of them. Off-hand, I think  there\r\n\r\nare  about three or four who have given their  services\r\n\r\nand  are being made use of. If the Member for Delta has\r\n\r\nany friends of hers who are private doctors and who are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  come and help - I am not asking  for  free\r\n\r\nservice,  I am not asking them to prescribe  their  own\r\n\r\nmedicines and so on for the poor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic  - we are prepared to pay them. I will  be  very\r\n\r\nhappy  indeed  if  the  Member for  Delta  can  suggest\r\n\r\nfriends of hers who are prepared to do this service. Of\r\n\r\ncourse, we will be glad to have them. This is a  system\r\n\r\nwhich  the Malaysian Government has copied from us.  We\r\n\r\nhave  had it for the last four or five years. They  are\r\n\r\njust  starting it and we wish them luck. So I can  only\r\n\r\nsay that if we can get as many doctors as we want, then\r\n\r\nwe  will  have to decide on our priorities and,  to  my\r\n\r\nmind,  the  priorities are that the doctors  should  go\r\n\r\nfirst to hospitals, and when we have enough of hospital\r\n\r\nbeds to look after the acutely sick, maybe we can think\r\n\r\nin terms of building more outpatient dispensaries. But,\r\n\r\nin  my  view,  there are more than adequate  Government\r\n\r\noutpatient dispensaries for a long time to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I merely\r\n\r\nwant  to  clarify two points raised by the Minister.

But because he is too  preoccupied\r\n\r\nwith his work, he might have neglected certain aspects.\r\n\r\nI  gave  an  example that last time  when  I  raised  a\r\n\r\nquestion about postal services, he answered in the  sam\r\n\r\nway,  that  in  these areas there were  already  postal\r\n\r\nservices. But he did not consider or carefully read the\r\n\r\nreport  submitted to him. The postal services  provided\r\n\r\nat  those  places  are inadequate and cannot  meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the  population there.  There  has  been  no\r\n\r\ndevelopment in the postal services.

If this Training School  is  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of training assistant nurses, I am of  the\r\n\r\nview that this subhead should be deleted, as there  are\r\n\r\nat  present in the Republic of Singapore facilities for\r\n\r\ntraining  assistant nurses. There are more nurses  than\r\n\r\nthe Government can absorb in the hospitals. But if this\r\n\r\nTraining  School is for the purpose of  training  staff\r\n\r\nnurses,  I fully support the inclusion of this subhead,\r\n\r\nas  the  hospitals  in  Singapore  are  experiencing  a\r\n\r\nshortage of staff nurses. Further. Mr Speaker, Sir, is\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  aware  that  many  nurses,  after  being\r\n\r\npromoted  to be staff nurses, leave Government  service\r\n\r\nand look for employment elsewhere? Is it because of the\r\n\r\nvery unreasonable salary that is being paid to them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I would like to say to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Telok Blangah that I have got his support, because\r\n\r\nthis  is  an  extension  for the  Outram  Road  General\r\n\r\nHospital  Nurses'  School which  trains  staff  nurses,\r\n\r\nwhich  means those who are admitted for training  after\r\n\r\ngetting their School Certificate. But I will not accept\r\n\r\nthat part of his speech where he says that if this were\r\n\r\nto  be  an  extension to the building of the  Assistant\r\n\r\nNurses'  Training School, then he would  object  to  it\r\n\r\nbecause  there  is  ample room  for  trained  assistant\r\n\r\nnurses.  Why  he probably jumps to that  conclusion  is\r\n\r\nthat  some assistant nurses have been asked to  wait  a\r\n\r\nwhile   before   they   are  put   on   the   permanent\r\n\r\nestablishment   because  of  certain  difficulties   of\r\n\r\nplacing staff.

You will notice a\r\n\r\nlittle  star  there stating that there is a  revote  of\r\n\r\n$22,000. The two markets which have already been  built - and  for which bills have to be settled next year - are\r\n\r\nJurong I Market at a cost of $167,000 and the Bukit  Ho\r\n\r\nSwee IV Market at a cost of $105,600. Therefore, a  sum\r\n\r\nof about $100,000 is left to cover Tuas Market which is\r\n\r\nway  up  in  the  Jurong area. It is at  present  under\r\n\r\nconstruction and will cost about $20,000, and it should\r\n\r\nbe finished by February 1967. The other item will be an\r\n\r\nextension of Holland Road Market for a sum of a  little\r\n\r\nover  $80,000.  This extension is necessitated  by  the\r\n\r\nrapid  housing development that has taken  place  along\r\n\r\nHolland  Road during the last few years. We  have  also\r\n\r\nmanaged   to   resite  about  80   hawkers   who   were\r\n\r\ncongregating at the triangle - the piece of vacant land\r\n\r\nin  front of Holland Road Village into the Holland Road\r\n\r\nMarket  itself. So it is necessary to extend our market\r\n\r\nto accommodate the present hawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has said that hawkers\r\n\r\nare  shy of markets. Unfortunately, it is true  and  it\r\n\r\nhas  been so for some time. But with the implementation\r\n\r\nof   the  new  Hawkers'  Code,  we  are  able  to  make\r\n\r\nunlicensed hawkers less shy to go into markets or  stay\r\n\r\na reasonable distance away from markets, as in the case\r\n\r\nof  a number of new markets which we have been able  to\r\n\r\ntackle  in recent months, especially the Killiney  Road\r\n\r\nprivate market where there was a large congregation  of\r\n\r\nhawkers outside, and we have been able to move some  of\r\n\r\nthem  inside it and resite a large number of them along\r\n\r\nSomerset Road and Exeter Road. We are using this  as  a\r\n\r\nmodel  for  re-siting other hawkers in  other  markets,\r\n\r\nwhich we shall attempt to do within the next few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is correct to say that markets are\r\n\r\nsuperfluous.  I  do not think it is even  necessary  to\r\n\r\nconduct an investigation as suggested by the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah. Markets are necessary. But we would  be\r\n\r\nnaive if we think we can build enough markets to put in\r\n\r\nall  the hawkers, because a market costs as much  as  a\r\n\r\nfew  hundred  thousand  dollars.  Let  us  say  it   is\r\n\r\n$300,000. It can only house 150 hawkers. But there  are\r\n\r\nnearly 40,000 to 50,000 hawkers in Singapore. I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  Singapore  can  afford  to  build  hundreds   of\r\n\r\nmillions  of  dollars' worth of markets to house  these\r\n\r\n40,000 to 50,000 hawkers. So I do not think we can work\r\n\r\non  the principle that if we build markets, we will  be\r\n\r\nable to tackle the problem. Some hawkers will be housed\r\n\r\nin  markets, but for some time to come, we will have to\r\n\r\npermit  some of them to trade in side streets and  have\r\n\r\nthem licensed and controlled. If and when we succeed in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  and the numbers  of  our  unemployed\r\n\r\nbecome  less and less, then there will be fewer  people\r\n\r\nwanting  to hawk as a means of livelihood. So I  think,\r\n\r\nwith  time  and  patience, we can license  and  control\r\n\r\nhawkers  and probably look to the day when we can  have\r\n\r\nfull  employment  in  Singapore  and  the  question  of\r\n\r\nhawkers, as we see it today, will become a thing of the\r\n\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  not  answered the question on the  old  market  at\r\n\r\nRaffles Quay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am sorry.

Sir,  every\r\n\r\nyear  the  Government  is  financing  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board with loans for building of houses for\r\n\r\nthe  people.  And each year, too, a certain  amount  of\r\n\r\nsubsidy,  which  amounts to over $8  million  for  this\r\n\r\nyear, is provided for the Housing Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsidy for a $20 one-room flat by the Government\r\n\r\nis  $15.65. The subsidy for a two-room flat is  $11.80.\r\n\r\nThe subsidy for a three-room flat is $6.60. Sir, whilst\r\n\r\nit is appreciated that a subsidy is necessary for flats\r\n\r\nfor  the poorer sections of the people, I feel that  it\r\n\r\nis  time  for the Government to reconsider the  overall\r\n\r\nsubsidy granted to the Housing Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last Budget debate I urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  get the Housing Board to make more houses available\r\n\r\nfor  purchase by the people. I think the Government has\r\n\r\nnot  given serious consideration to my suggestion. When\r\n\r\nhome ownership for the people was started in 1964, some\r\n\r\n2,068 homes were made available to the public; in 1965,\r\n\r\n1,416  units; and in 1966, i.e., this year,  I  believe\r\n\r\nthe figure is more or less the same as for last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are people who are anxious to\r\n\r\npurchase  homes  either  on a  cash  basis  or  through\r\n\r\narrangements provided by the Housing Board. I feel that\r\n\r\neveryone  who  applies to buy a home from  the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  should be given every opportunity of  doing  so,\r\n\r\nsince  the  Housing Board is building so  many  houses,\r\n\r\nmost of which are for rent to the people. And there  is\r\n\r\nno  reason  why everyone who wants to purchase  a  home\r\n\r\nthrough  arrangements with the Housing Board should  be\r\n\r\ndenied the opportunity of doing so or should be kept on\r\n\r\nthe waiting list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I would urge the Government to think\r\n\r\nseriously  of  making, home ownership  easier  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, rightly my\r\n\r\ncolleague should reply to this question, but -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Much  as we like to review the subsidy  to  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board, I do not think that we in any way  have\r\n\r\ninfringed the principle that the poor should be  helped\r\n\r\nmore  and  the not-so-poor should be helped less.  From\r\n\r\nthe  figures that I gave in replying to the  debate  on\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  Statement, you will notice,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  that the one-room units which are rented  by  the\r\n\r\nvery poor are subsidised to the extent of more than  75\r\n\r\nto 80 per cent of the rental; and when you come further\r\n\r\ndown  to  the  three-room units  where  the  rental  is\r\n\r\n$66.50,  the  subsidy is between $2 and $6.  All  these\r\n\r\nsubsidies  are  given to people who we consider  should\r\n\r\nget  some element of housing subsidy, because they  are\r\n\r\npeople  whose  personal income is less  than  $500  per\r\n\r\nmonth  and  whose total family income is not more  than\r\n\r\n$800.  Of  course, when the time comes  when  there  is\r\n\r\nfuller employment in Singapore, we may reconsider  this\r\n\r\nquestion  of  subsidising people who  are  renting  the\r\n\r\nthree-room units and paying $66.50 rent per  month  and\r\n\r\nwho  are  being subsidised to the extent of between  $2\r\n\r\nand $6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Cairnhill (Laughter] - I am\r\n\r\nsorry, the Member for River Valley; the confusion arose\r\n\r\nbecause  Cairnhill and River Valley  used  to  own  one\r\n\r\nbranch  together! The Member for River Valley  proposes\r\n\r\nthat more houses should be made available for sale  and\r\n\r\nthat  everyone  who  wants to buy  a  house  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed to buy one. I think our policy is to sell  only\r\n\r\nto those who are eligible to buy. There is a limitation\r\n\r\nto  the income of the applicant, i.e., if he belongs to\r\n\r\na  higher  income group, he is not allowed  to  buy.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  what  the Member has in mind is that  everyone\r\n\r\nwho  is  eligible to purchase a housing unit should  he\r\n\r\ngiven  a chance to purchase one, and that more of these\r\n\r\nhouses should be made available for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Mr Speaker, Sir, one has to weigh whether\r\n\r\nto satisfy all those who are eligible to purchase\r\n\r\nhouses fro the Housing Board by allowing them so\r\n\r\npurchase, or to give a chance to those who can only\r\n\r\nafford to rent houses from the Housing Board to so\r\n\r\nrent. We only build a limited number of about 10,000 to\r\n\r\n12,000 units, and, at the moment, I think we have a few\r\n\r\nthousand units on the register waiting to be rented\r\n\r\nout. Therefore, if we satisfy those who want to\r\n\r\npurchase, we will have less for renting. So it is a\r\n\r\nquestion of weighing priorities - who should the first\r\n\r\noption and where they should go. Much as we like to, we\r\n\r\nfind it i possible to meet the demands of all those who\r\n\r\nare eligible to purchase houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last query put up by the Member for River Valley\r\n\r\nis something which cannot understand.

One  of the reasons  he  gave  was  that\r\n\r\nbecause  there is a big demand by people  who  want  to\r\n\r\nrent  houses, therefore, the houses available for  sale\r\n\r\nto  people  who  are  eligible are thereby  reduced.  I\r\n\r\ncannot share his opinion, Sir, because if more of  such\r\n\r\nhomes are made available to people who are eligible  to\r\n\r\nown  these homes, then the number of people who  demand\r\n\r\nhouses  to  rent  would correspondingly  decrease.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I have here a pamphlet produced  by  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board  with  regard  to  home\r\n\r\nownership  for  the  people. It is  a  very  attractive\r\n\r\npamphlet. It states here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In February 1964, the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment announced a home ownership for the people's\r\n\r\nscheme and entrusted the Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nwith  the responsibility for implementing it. The basic\r\n\r\nobjective  of  this  scheme is  to  encourage  property\r\n\r\nowning  democracy in Singapore and to enable  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens in the lower middle income group to own  their\r\n\r\nown homes.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what I am asking the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  and also the Minister for National Development\r\n\r\nto do is to get the Housing Board to consider seriously\r\n\r\nwhat they preach and put it into practice. Just now the\r\n\r\nMinister  was  asking  me what I meant  by  making  the\r\n\r\nscheme  easier. I realise this is a serious matter  and\r\n\r\nhas financial implications. But, at the present moment,\r\n\r\nthe  arrangements and the regulations for those who are\r\n\r\neligible to buy these homes are quite restrictive,  and\r\n\r\nI  was  asking the Minister whether he could look  into\r\n\r\nthe conditions which would make it less restrictive for\r\n\r\nthe people to own homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nvote  for the Housing and Development Board should  not\r\n\r\nbe  made  disappointing by the Government. For example,\r\n\r\napplicants who wish to get one-room flats urgently have\r\n\r\nbeen offered two-room flats by the Board which they  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  and which they cannot afford to  rent.  This\r\n\r\nalso  applies  to applicants who ask  for  flats  in  a\r\n\r\ncertain  area  which they like, but because  they  want\r\n\r\nthem rather urgently, they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffered  flats  in  other areas. This development  vote\r\n\r\nshould  also  improve  the  situation  by  meeting  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of the applicants for flats,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier. This vote should make the people  happy,\r\n\r\nparticularly the applicants for housing flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Therefore,\r\n\r\nif  you satisfy one group fully, you may not he able to\r\n\r\nsatisfy the other group. And if he would more carefully\r\n\r\nread the pamphlet which he quoted, he would notice that\r\n\r\nit  is mentioned therein that we want to bring about  a\r\n\r\nhouse-owning democracy by encouraging the lower  middle\r\n\r\nincome  group to own houses, and these houses could  be\r\n\r\nsold  only  to  this  group.  It  is  because  of  this\r\n\r\nobjective that we drew up certain rules and regulations\r\n\r\nto  prevent abuse. As a result of this, we have a group\r\n\r\nof  people who otherwise would not find it possible  to\r\n\r\nown  houses.  Because of this policy now,  there  is  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of  people  who own their own homes.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nthey  would  be in no position at all to  purchase  any\r\n\r\nhouse of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the question of satisfying applicants for\r\n\r\nflats. I think it has often been mentioned here that we\r\n\r\ncan  provide  an applicant with a house if  he  is  not\r\n\r\nchoosy, because the number of houses that are available\r\n\r\nis   limited  as  against  the  number  of  applicants.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if  a person is in real urgent  need  of  a\r\n\r\nhouse,  he  cannot designate the locality in  which  he\r\n\r\nwants to rent the house. Maybe it is because there  are\r\n\r\nnone  available  and therefore it is  not  possible  to\r\n\r\naccede to every wish of the applicant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time allotted for Head 40 having expired, the\r\n\r\nfollowing amendment, standing in the names of Mr Teong\r\n\r\nEng  Siong and Inche Mohd.

The number of readers is expected  to\r\n\r\nexceed  our target of 120,000 by the end of this  year.\r\n\r\nThis  is  too  big  a number for our National  Library.\r\n\r\nThere    is   already   serious   over-crowding,    and\r\n\r\ndecentralisation is necessary. Apart from the  National\r\n\r\nLibrary,  there are two part-time branch  libraries  in\r\n\r\nSiglap  and Joo Chiat community centres, and  a  mobile\r\n\r\nlibrary  which  stops  for two hours  a  week  at  four\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres,  namely, Tanjong  Pagar,  the  West\r\n\r\nCoast, Nee Soon and Bukit Panjang community centres. As\r\n\r\na  result  of  the  expected expansion  of  the  mobile\r\n\r\nlibrary   service  in  1967,  12  additional  community\r\n\r\ncentres will be served. The proposed Queenstown  Branch\r\n\r\nLibrary  will be the first full-time branch library  of\r\n\r\nthe  National Library to serve an estimated  population\r\n\r\nof  160,000.

We intend to build one in 1967, and this  is\r\n\r\nthe  new Junior Approved School for boys below the  age\r\n\r\nof 14. At the moment, we have a Senior Approved School,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the Gimson School for Boys at Clementi  Road\r\n\r\nwhich caters for boys between the ages of 14 and 16. We\r\n\r\nconsider  it  highly desirable that  the  younger  boys\r\n\r\nshould  be separated from the older boys, as the former\r\n\r\nrequire  different  training and  treatment  facilities\r\n\r\nfrom  the  older  boys,  and it is  also  necessary  to\r\n\r\nprevent the smaller boys from falling under the adverse\r\n\r\ninfluence of the bigger and more experienced boys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose to build the Junior Approved School on\r\n\r\nland  available at Clementi Road near the Gimson School\r\n\r\nfor  Boys,  and  it  will provide  facilities  for  the\r\n\r\ntraining  and  rehabilitation of  some  80  delinquents\r\n\r\ncommitted for such training by the courts.

This  House  will  recall  that   the   1966\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates debates in  December  1965,  the\r\n\r\nParliament  Secretary to the Minister  for  So  Affairs\r\n\r\nassured the House that beaches would be beautified  and\r\n\r\namenities provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am delighted to know that the plan to improve our\r\n\r\nbeaches  is  now  beginning  to  take  shape  and  will\r\n\r\nmaterialise the sum so provided in 1967. Sir, now  wish\r\n\r\nto  seek further information on what the Minister plans\r\n\r\nto  do  a how this sum could be best used. I wonder  if\r\n\r\nthe  project  will include building of beach  huts,  or\r\n\r\nwhat   are  commonly  known  as  chalets,  for  seaside\r\n\r\npicnickers where they can change and relax At present I\r\n\r\nnotice  that at certain places swimmers have to  change\r\n\r\ntheir  clothing behind bushes and some even have do  it\r\n\r\nin  their  cars. However, if there are  beach  huts  or\r\n\r\nchalets which can be hired out to picnickers on a daily\r\n\r\nbasis, they will certainly provide privacy to swimmers,\r\n\r\nparticularly to the ladies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we have many camp sites and toilet\r\n\r\nfacilities near the seaside, but these are not adequate\r\n\r\nand  unsuitable for changing purposes. Many picnickers,\r\n\r\nparticularly ladies, are not served with any facilities\r\n\r\nfor  privacy.  I  hope  the  Government  will  consider\r\n\r\nbuilding  proper beach resorts and creational amenities\r\n\r\nto meet the needs of our citizens as well as to attract\r\n\r\ntourists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister consider using this sum to provide\r\n\r\nnot  only facilities changing rooms but also individual\r\n\r\nchalets or wooden huts for those who want to hire  them\r\n\r\nfor  the  day?

Firstly,  about  the   10   children's\r\n\r\nplaygrounds. Where are they to be built? Have the sites\r\n\r\nbeen  chosen for the two parks? If no sites  have  been\r\n\r\nchosen,  I  suggest that at least one must  be  in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas.

Since\r\n\r\nwe  are asking for so much money for the development of\r\n\r\nmore  children's playgrounds and more parks, I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow whether the Minister will agree with me when I say\r\n\r\nthat, at the present moment, the existing parks are not\r\n\r\nideal.  They have not reached a satisfactory  standard.\r\n\r\nFor  example, Kallang Park is a place where many people\r\n\r\ngo  every  day  to  breathe fresh air and  where  their\r\n\r\nchildren  can play. If we look at this place carefully,\r\n\r\nwe  will  notice that it does not look like a park.  It\r\n\r\nlooks  like  a  factory site because ship-repairing  is\r\n\r\ngoing  on  there.  And we find a  lot  of  lorries  and\r\n\r\nfactories also. So this place does not look like a park\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I mean to ask, Mr Speaker, is that the Minister\r\n\r\nshould turn this place into a real park and take  steps\r\n\r\nto  beautify it, because it is suitably located and  is\r\n\r\nconvenient to many people compared with other parks  on\r\n\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Mr Speaker, I would also suggest\r\n\r\nthat  in  future when parks are to be built,  provision\r\n\r\nshould  be  made for oriental colours to  be  added  to\r\n\r\nthem.  In other words, the parks must be representative\r\n\r\nof  the characteristics of the nation, so that whenever\r\n\r\nlocal  people  or foreigners see them,  they  can  tell\r\n\r\nstraightaway  whether they are oriental or  occidental.\r\n\r\nForeigners  who  come  to  the  place  will  see   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is a different country.

It  is  quite  necessary that  every  possible\r\n\r\nencouragement  and  facility should  be  given  to  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community  in promoting  their  business  and\r\n\r\ntrade.  The  heart-land of Singapore business  lies  in\r\n\r\nChange  Alley, Market Street, Cecil Street and Robinson\r\n\r\nRoad. Since the road frontages in these areas have been\r\n\r\nmarked  Out  with car parking bays, big business  firms\r\n\r\nhaving  stores  and  godowns  and  a  big  turnover  of\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  these areas are deprived of  loading  and\r\n\r\nunloading  facilities during office hours.  The  Multi-storey  Car  Park in Market Street was  anticipated  to\r\n\r\nrelieve the parking problem considerably in that  area,\r\n\r\nand  although  this  car  park  now  operates  to  full\r\n\r\ncapacity,  yet the road congestion in the area  is  not\r\n\r\nremoved.

W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if we can start from the\r\n\r\nlast query: the answer is that I have no plans to build\r\n\r\nany  car park in Sembawang. But to go back existing car\r\n\r\nparks  in the central business districts have, in fact,\r\n\r\nreached  saturation point, with the result that parking\r\n\r\nschemes  have  to be extended to the periphery  of  the\r\n\r\ncity. Although car parks have been incorporated in  the\r\n\r\nurban  renewal  programme as well as the  comprehensive\r\n\r\nplanning  of traffic movement and transportation,  they\r\n\r\nwould take some time to be built. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder, therefore, to ease the rapidly worsening parking\r\n\r\nproblem  brought  about by the phenomenal  build-up  of\r\n\r\nmotor  traffic  as  well as to  free  the  road  for  a\r\n\r\nsmoother  flow of traffic, Government has decided  that\r\n\r\nmore  multi-storey  car  parks  should  be  constructed\r\n\r\nwithout delay. In view of the very high land values  in\r\n\r\nthe  central area of the city the development of multi-storey   structures  solely  for  car  parks   is   not\r\n\r\nconsidered desirable, and instead multi-level and multi-purpose  buildings with provision for two levels  below\r\n\r\nground  floors for car parking as well as shopping  and\r\n\r\noffice  accommodation  are to  be  preferred.  What  we\r\n\r\nintend  to  build  is, if I may go back,  below  ground\r\n\r\nlevel an underground car park; above ground level - one\r\n\r\nor  two storeys -shopping, and above that accommodation\r\n\r\nfor offices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has asked me a direct\r\n\r\nquestion  whether  I  intend to build  a  car  park  at\r\n\r\nClifford  Pier.  The answer is yes. This  car  park  is\r\n\r\nbeing  given  priority. We have  no  squatter  problems\r\n\r\nthere.  The land is vacant. At the moment, it is  being\r\n\r\nused for parking in the open. We intend to build a  car\r\n\r\npark  there  soon.  That will be the first.  There  are\r\n\r\nothers. I mentioned the one at Colombo Court yesterday,\r\n\r\nand  the Member for Farrer Park today asked why  we  do\r\n\r\nnot take more positive action against squatters sitting\r\n\r\non  the site. We have taken some action. In fact,  most\r\n\r\nof the tenants who use the buildings only for residence\r\n\r\nhave vacated. It is the shopkeepers on the ground floor\r\n\r\nwho  are  being  stubborn, and short of  evicting  them\r\n\r\novernight  and putting them on the road -  a  procedure\r\n\r\nwhich  we  consider highly undesirable -  there  is  no\r\n\r\nother  means  to get them out except by persuasion.  We\r\n\r\nhave  tried this. So far it has failed. Perhaps in  the\r\n\r\nnear future we will have to take more drastic action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other sites for car parks are in Phillip Street.\r\n\r\nHere we will have to acquire certain valuable land  and\r\n\r\nthen  again  the question of eviction will arise.

The  School\r\n\r\nwas  only  used for three years and after that  it  was\r\n\r\ntotally   neglected  and  is  now  in  a  deteriorating\r\n\r\ncondition.  Now  the Primary Production Department  has\r\n\r\ndecided to develop it into a Fisheries Training  Centre\r\n\r\nwith this provision of $180,000 for the year 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not for a moment oppose the principle of\r\n\r\ndeveloping a Training Centre for the fishing  industry.\r\n\r\nBut  certainly a better site elsewhere can  be  located\r\n\r\nfor this purpose, such as Punggol, Kangar or one of the\r\n\r\noffshore  islands which are more suitable for  fishing,\r\n\r\nmarine  research  and  training  centre.  As  for  this\r\n\r\nparticular site, i.e. Changi Point, which has the  best\r\n\r\nbeach  in  Singapore, I do not see  why  it  should  be\r\n\r\nwantonly  wasted on a School for Fisheries  instead  of\r\n\r\nconverting  the  present building and its  surroundings\r\n\r\ninto a first-class beach recreation ground in order  to\r\n\r\nattract  tourists who can spend millions of dollars  on\r\n\r\ntheir visit to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that Singapore is on the world tourist map and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  spending millions  of  dollars  to\r\n\r\nencourage  tourists to come here, surely  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  reconsider  changing this site  in  favour  of  a\r\n\r\nrecreational   beach  resort  for  our   citizens   and\r\n\r\ntourists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can visualise, Changi Point should have\r\n\r\nhotels,  restaurants,  beach chalets,  parks,  children\r\n\r\nplaygrounds and such other facilities which are  common\r\n\r\nfeatures in well-known countries where tourism thrives,\r\n\r\ne.g. Hawaii, Honolulu or even Long Beach in California.\r\n\r\nThis  project can either be developed by Government  or\r\n\r\nby the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the Minister, in view of the increasing\r\n\r\ntourist trade, will seriously reconsider an alternative\r\n\r\nsite  for  the Fisheries Training Centre  in  order  to\r\n\r\npreserve  the  best  part  of  our  beach  from   being\r\n\r\nimproperly used.

One day they find that there is nothing\r\n\r\nbut  swamp land, and in a few months or even days -  if\r\n\r\nthey visit the same area again - they find nothing  but\r\n\r\nmulti-storey  buildings, roads all the other  amenities\r\n\r\nthat  go  w development. It seems to me that a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney  is,  however, wasted in providing footpaths  and\r\n\r\ncycle  tracks every time a new road is built. I am  not\r\n\r\nsaying  that these should not be provided. In  fact,  I\r\n\r\nthink  they  are  essential  for  poor  pedestrian  and\r\n\r\ncyclist in Singapore if they are to keep out of the way\r\n\r\nsome speed maniacs with which every country is plagued,\r\n\r\nand of which Singapore has more than its fair share.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am against is that when these are provided at\r\n\r\nsome expense, we s see cyclists cycling and pedestrians\r\n\r\nwalking on the road. I can think of some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreasons for this. One is probably due to the fact  that\r\n\r\nsome  of our cyclists and pedestrians have not got  the\r\n\r\nsense  to make use of the facilities provided.  Another\r\n\r\nreason  probably is due to the fact that footpaths  and\r\n\r\ntracks  are  taken up by hawkers. A further  reason  is\r\n\r\nthat   the  tracks  and  footpaths  are  in  such  poor\r\n\r\ncondition  that cyclists and pedestrians are forced  to\r\n\r\nmake use of the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you will agree with me, Sir, and you may have\r\n\r\nnoticed  it  yourself, that no sooner is a cycle  track\r\n\r\nmade than up come the P.U.B. or the Telephone Board  or\r\n\r\nthe  P.W.D. to  dig it up, and by the time  they  have\r\n\r\nfinished  their  work, it is not  fit  to  be  used  by\r\n\r\nanyone.  You  may have also noticed, Sir, that  due  to\r\n\r\nlack  of  maintenance there is more  grass  growing  on\r\n\r\nthese tracks than on the road verge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that it would take an army to educate the\r\n\r\nmasses  that  they  should make use of  the  facilities\r\n\r\nprovided.  It  will take some time to make  the  people\r\n\r\nrealise that footpaths and cycle tracks are to be  made\r\n\r\nuse  of.  I  would suggest to the Ministers -  not  one\r\n\r\nMinister  but several Ministers concerned -  that  they\r\n\r\nstep  up the campaign for safety on the roads. Cyclists\r\n\r\nshould be fined for not making use of cycle tracks, and\r\n\r\npedestrians  pulled up or fined for not making  use  of\r\n\r\nfootpaths  and  crossing the roads at  any  point  they\r\n\r\nwish. Only when we accomplish this can we consider that\r\n\r\nthe monies spent on footpaths and cycle tracks are well\r\n\r\nspent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of roads or drains, I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister how much was spent on making  up  of\r\n\r\ndrains  in  the  rural areas during the year  1966.  We\r\n\r\nheard  the Minister for Health the other day mentioning\r\n\r\nin this House that nearly half the city's rubbish could\r\n\r\nbe  found  in  drains. We find that in the rural  areas\r\n\r\nroadside  drains  which are made up today  may  not  be\r\n\r\nthere  the  following week. Drains made  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  are usually not lined and dependent on the  type\r\n\r\nof  weather, and especially during the rainy season you\r\n\r\nwill find that they are filled up with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearth  that is washed off the roads within a matter  of\r\n\r\ndays, and all the money spent on making up these drains\r\n\r\nhas - as what one would say - gone down the drain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Minister consider\r\n\r\nthe   possibility  of  planning  roadside  drains  with\r\n\r\nconcrete slabs or other suitable material. It would  be\r\n\r\nmore  expensive  initially,  but  the  money  saved  in\r\n\r\ncontinually desilting the present-type drains will more\r\n\r\nthan warrant the initial expenses. Furthermore, Sir, it\r\n\r\nwill  save  the  expenses  of  having  continually   to\r\n\r\nresurface  roads  in the rural areas  which  are  being\r\n\r\neroded during the rainy season, because the drains  are\r\n\r\nnot deep enough to carry away the excess water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> The Member for Serangoon Gardens\r\n\r\nhas  just mentioned footpaths and cycle tracks. He says\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  problem.  The  Urban  and  Rural  Services\r\n\r\ncommittee  is provided with this vote for public  roads\r\n\r\nwhich are much used by pedestrians near schools, market\r\n\r\nplaces, places of entertainment and worship. These  are\r\n\r\nusually  much used by vehicles also. To cater  for  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  pedestrians and even cyclists,  footpaths  and\r\n\r\ncycle tracks are constructed. Footpaths for pedestrians\r\n\r\nare  normally  five  feet wide and  footpaths-cum-cycle\r\n\r\ntracks  for both pedestrians and cyclists are  12  feet\r\n\r\nwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not true that when the P.U.B. or some other\r\n\r\nstatutory  board want to undertake some  project,  they\r\n\r\nhave to damage the footpath, and after the project  has\r\n\r\nbeen completed, this damaged footpath is left as it is.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  after the project is completed, the  damaged\r\n\r\nfootpath is repaired again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the starting of a campaign for road\r\n\r\nsafety,  I  notice that the Ministry of Social  Affairs\r\n\r\nhas set up a Safety First Council recently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> This Council was set up by the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> I thank the Minister for his\r\n\r\nclarification.

This is a good  suggestion,  but\r\n\r\ncomparing  the  construction of a road and  that  of  a\r\n\r\ndrain, the construction of a drain will cost much  more\r\n\r\nthan  that  of a road. A road in the rural constituency\r\n\r\nis  more  important  than a drain. Because  of  limited\r\n\r\nfunds,  more  concentration  should  be  given  on  the\r\n\r\nrepairing of roads.

I  was  not\r\n\r\nsaying  that roads are not important. I said  we  could\r\n\r\nspend  less on resurfacing roads, as excess water could\r\n\r\nbe  drained away instead of its draining away on to the\r\n\r\nroad itself.

The  Committee  has   made   several\r\n\r\nimprovements  in  the  construction  of  roads,  street\r\n\r\nlighting,  drains,  etc.,  particularly  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  During the colonial regime and also during  the\r\n\r\nAlliance Government of Lim Yew Hock and U.M.N.O., these\r\n\r\nareas  were  neglected  altogether,  including  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai,  which was previously represented by an U.M.N.O. member.  \r\n\r\nHe  was also a Minister in the  Lim  Yew  Hock Government.  \r\n\r\nThrough the efforts of the U.R.S.C. under the  P.A.P.  \r\n\r\nGovernment now, gradual improvements  have been  made.  \r\n\r\nHowever, we still find some defects  which should  be  remedied  by the U.R.S.C.  The  fundamental\r\n\r\nproblem  is that of finance, although a vote  has  been\r\n\r\nallocated for each constituency for one year. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow where the fault lies. I will give an example.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  expenditure for the construction  of  a\r\n\r\nroad  is  $24,500. While the vote for that constituency\r\n\r\nis  more  than the amount quoted, that road  cannot  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  by  the department concerned on the ground  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  money.  What has happened  to  the  vote\r\n\r\nallocated  for  each  constituency  for  the  projects?\r\n\r\nSimilarly the allocation of votes for each constituency\r\n\r\ndiffers, for instance, between the rural areas and  the\r\n\r\ncity  area.  But  such  votes  must  be  based  on  the\r\n\r\nconditions  and  circumstances  of  each  constituency,\r\n\r\nwhich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be  put  right  because  it  happens  that  the\r\n\r\nconditions in the rural constituencies are better  than\r\n\r\nthose in the city area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Geylang Serai is a low-lying area with\r\n\r\na total population of several thousands. This area is a\r\n\r\nslum  area. The conditions there are bad, and the roads\r\n\r\nand  drainage  should be improved.  The  Geylang  Serai\r\n\r\nConstituency has not previously enjoyed any  amenities,\r\n\r\neither from the colonial Government or the Lim Yew Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment.  At  that time the area  was  dark  because\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  street lighting. The  roads  were  bad.\r\n\r\nPeople had occasion to call the roads by certain names,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  users of the roads had to lift  up  their\r\n\r\nsarongs.  Since  the  P.A.P. came  to  power  in  1959,\r\n\r\nGeylang   Serai  has  made  considerable   improvement,\r\n\r\nespecially through the efforts of the U.R.S.C. which is\r\n\r\nestablished  by the Government. We can see the  results\r\n\r\nthere.  However,  more  consideration  and  more  money\r\n\r\nshould be given to this constituency in order to  carry\r\n\r\nout the projects which have not been implemented there.\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai has received a vote of $53,090.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to speak on this head and to  raise  three\r\n\r\nquestions.  I  hope  the  Minister  will  answer  them.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  I would like to know whether the  Urban  and\r\n\r\nRural Services Committee has any plans to deal with the\r\n\r\ndelay  in  the improvement in the rural areas.  When  a\r\n\r\nMember  of  Parliament  of  a constituency  raises  the\r\n\r\nquestion of improvement to be made in his constituency,\r\n\r\nhis  letter will first be considered by the  Urban  and\r\n\r\nRural  Services Committee. This will take about half  a\r\n\r\nyear   to  complete.  So  I  see  no  benefit  in  this\r\n\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to know whether the Urban and\r\n\r\nRural Services Committee has any good plan to carry out\r\n\r\nthe   various  projects  in  the  rural  constituencies\r\n\r\naccording to the votes given to them. For instance,  in\r\n\r\nmy  constituency, the vote is already exhausted  before\r\n\r\nit can be used to provide more street lights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nafter  the  votes  have  been allotted,  there  is  any\r\n\r\nplanning   for   the   development   of   the   various\r\n\r\nconstituencies;  whether the department  concerned  has\r\n\r\nany  consultation with all the organisations and people\r\n\r\nconcerned to formulate plans and to carry out the plans\r\n\r\nand projects speedily without red tape; and whether the\r\n\r\ndepartment  concerned can develop the various  projects\r\n\r\nin  the various constituencies evenly and on a balanced\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask the Minister something.

From 1963  up  to  now,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has spent $600,000 on public amenities  like\r\n\r\nstreet  lighting,  good  roads,  standpipes  and  other\r\n\r\nprojects  in  this  constituency.  The  Government   is\r\n\r\ndetermined  not  only to look after the  Geylang  Serai\r\n\r\nConstituency, but also other rural constituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the allocation of funds to the\r\n\r\nconstituencies, the amount is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbased  on  the size and population of constituency  and\r\n\r\nthe  area in which it is situated. For instance,  Anson\r\n\r\nConstituency has 147 acres - .23 square mile - and  the\r\n\r\npopulation   is  about  22,500.  The  vote   for   this\r\n\r\nconstituency, which is in the urban area, is $12,828.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geylang Serai, a suburban area, 595 acres - .93\r\n\r\nsquare  mile  -  and  a population  of  44,100.  It  is\r\n\r\neligible for $53,991.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurong, in the rural area, has 18,867 acres - 29.48\r\n\r\nsquare  miles  -  and a population  of  28,700  and  is\r\n\r\nentitled $91,846. As I have just pointed out, funds are\r\n\r\nfairly  allocated to e constituency. So I am afraid  we\r\n\r\ncan favour any particular constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Paya Lebar, this is the\r\n\r\nfirst time I heard complaint that proposals to make  up\r\n\r\na   road  or  some  other  project  take  year  to   be\r\n\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too:</b> Half a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Half a year. If he could bring me\r\n\r\nthis particular case, I will look into the matter.

Mr  Speaker, I would  suggest  that  Member\r\n\r\nconcerned should, when putting up a proposal, send me a\r\n\r\ncopy  of  ii  that I can keep track of it  and  officer\r\n\r\nconcerned should submit report directly to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker.
