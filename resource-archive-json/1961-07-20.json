On\r\n\r\nMonday, the 10th of July-ten days ago - at a forum at\r\n\r\nthe  University of Malaya especially organised  for\r\n\r\nthe  occasion  to discuss the basis of  merger,  an\r\n\r\nopen  collision took place between Mr Devan  Nair,\r\n\r\nwho  represented the P.A.P., and Mr Woodhull,  who\r\n\r\nrepresented Mr Lim Ching Siong and four others  in\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C. Mr Woodhull, Mr Devan Nair,  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong, Mr Fong Swee Suan, the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, myself and several other members  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Executive Committee of my Party  were  old\r\n\r\ncomrades in the P.A.P. Now an open break has  taken\r\n\r\nplace  when Mr Woodhull, a Political Secretary  in\r\n\r\nthe  present  Government, in the last week  of  the\r\n\r\nAnson  by-election, openly attacked Mr Devan Nair,\r\n\r\na   former  member  of  the  P.A.P. and  a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nstalwart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, the 14th of July - six days ago-eight\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  of the P.A.P. came out supporting  the\r\n\r\nTrade  Union  Six;  and, in open  breach  of  Party\r\n\r\ndiscipline and the rules of decency, created public\r\n\r\nconfusion  by  demanding the P.A.P.'s disavowal  of\r\n\r\nMr Devan Nair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was this all about? Their object in doing\r\n\r\nthis was to make us lose the Anson by-election  and\r\n\r\nthe  more  heavily our candidate was defeated,  the\r\n\r\nmore  it suited their plot. They have succeeded  in\r\n\r\nmaking  our candidate lose. 1,500 people  abstained\r\n\r\nfrom  voting in Anson, disillusioned by this  Party\r\n\r\ndissension  brought out into the open  deliberately\r\n\r\non  the  eve  of Polling Day, and we  lost  to  the\r\n\r\npresent Member for Anson by 546 votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it all about? The time has come to begin\r\n\r\nto  explain frankly what is happening and why it is\r\n\r\nhappening.  After Hong Lim, when we  were  defeated\r\n\r\nbadly, I felt that if the people desired\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit, there should be a reference back to the people.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it was decided by a majority  opinion  of\r\n\r\nthe Party that we should first fight Anson and then\r\n\r\nreconsider  the  position. At that  time,  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing   Siong  and  all  his  trade  union  friends\r\n\r\nstrenuously  opposed any talk of  our  resignation.\r\n\r\nNow,  however,  after  losing  Anson  by  a  narrow\r\n\r\nmajority, and because of this attempt by the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnion  Six and eight Assemblymen - one of whom  is  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  Trade  Union  Six - to  capture  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the Party, we are resolved  not  to\r\n\r\nabdicate  our position in order that the Party  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  does not pass into  the  hands  of\r\n\r\npeople who intend to use it for purposes for  which\r\n\r\nthe  people did not vote the P.A.P. in. The present\r\n\r\nleadership of the Party was responsible for winning\r\n\r\nthe  last elections and getting the mandate of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  and  it is our duty not to  give  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing Siong and his friends any opportunity to take\r\n\r\nover  this  Government in order  to  run  it  as  a\r\n\r\nCommunist front Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it all about? Their first plan now, since\r\n\r\nthey  are unable to capture the Government,  is  to\r\n\r\nget  me  to resign in order that someone whom  they\r\n\r\nbelieve they can manipulate could be elected  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  They  hope  in  this  way  to  force   a\r\n\r\ncompromise in the policy of the Government so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  extend Communist influence in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand   prevent  us  from  fulfilling  our   declared\r\n\r\nobjective of independence through merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  with or without the Borneo  territories\r\n\r\nin  1963. This move has now been frustrated by  the\r\n\r\nunanimous   decision  of  the   Central   Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  to  stand collectively together  against\r\n\r\nany  change. And this stand has been endorsed by  a\r\n\r\nmajority of P.A.P. Assemblymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is one of confidence and the motion\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  be  carried as  it  stands  without\r\n\r\namendment,  or  the  Government  must  resign   and\r\n\r\ngeneral   elections  follow.   On   a   motion   of\r\n\r\nconfidence, any amendment is tantamount to  a  vote\r\n\r\nof no confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the hon. Members on the other side of the\r\n\r\nHouse, may I say, on behalf of my colleagues and I,\r\n\r\nthat  if they want general elections then they  can\r\n\r\nvote against the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This extraordinary session has become necessary\r\n\r\nbecause  of the sudden turn of events of  the  last\r\n\r\nfew  weeks.  Eight Assemblymen on the  P.A.P. side\r\n\r\nhave  openly  defied the Party leadership.  Demands\r\n\r\nfor my resignation as Prime Minister have been made\r\n\r\nand  it  is  now  necessary that the  House  should\r\n\r\nclearly give us a mandate to carry on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall, Mr Speaker, Sir, that when we\r\n\r\nlast  met  on  14th  June,  1961,  the  House   was\r\n\r\nadjourned  sine  die,  the  reason  being  that  we\r\n\r\nexpected  to  prorogue the session  and  re-convene\r\n\r\nagain at the end of October after you have returned\r\n\r\nfrom  a  C.P.A. conference in London. I  understand\r\n\r\nyou  will  be  leaving Singapore in  September  and\r\n\r\nreturning  in mid-October. Therefore,  before  this\r\n\r\nHouse  goes into recess, we must make it  clear  to\r\n\r\nthe people that we have the mandate of the Assembly\r\n\r\nto carry on as the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this stand we know that we shall face a fresh\r\n\r\noffensive which will be mounted maybe on labour and\r\n\r\nindustrial  sections  and  on  many  other  fronts.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it was necessary that I should  have  a\r\n\r\nclear  mandate from the Central Executive Committee\r\n\r\nand  the  P.A.P. Assemblymen who have  to  go  into\r\n\r\nbattle  with us. This mandate I have been given  by\r\n\r\nthe  Party,  and  I  now formally  ask  it  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my duty to tell the House of the trials and\r\n\r\ntribulations  which  lie  ahead  and  of  the  many\r\n\r\nunpleasant  things which may have  to  be  done  in\r\n\r\norder  to  maintain the economy of this island  and\r\n\r\nthe people's welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has come also for the unvarnished truth\r\n\r\nto  be  told. For two years, the British Government\r\n\r\nhas  tried to manipulate the P.A.P. into a position\r\n\r\nwhere  we  will become the successor  to  what  was\r\n\r\ncalled  the  Lim  Yew  Hock Government,  where  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party will be attacked  not  by  British\r\n\r\nimperialism,   which  is  the  supreme   power   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   but   by  us,  the   locally   elected\r\n\r\nGovernment  with  limited powers. To  achieve  this\r\n\r\nend,  every blandishment and argument has been  put\r\n\r\nforward,  and every device and seductive  manoeuvre\r\n\r\npractised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two years, the British have decided that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is impervious probably to such blandishment\r\n\r\nand  perhaps they have decided that we may  be  men\r\n\r\nwho  are  not influenced by personal considerations\r\n\r\nof wishing to stay in power. We have stated that we\r\n\r\nare prepared to lay down our office at any time  at\r\n\r\nthe behest of the people and we are not going to be\r\n\r\nmanipulated by any power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big scheme we have only been able to piece\r\n\r\ntogether  after  the Anson by-election.  The  plot,\r\n\r\ncounter-plot and sub-plots that have been going  on\r\n\r\nwould make an Oppenheim thriller read like a simple\r\n\r\ncomic  strip  cartoon.  The  diplomacy,  skill  and\r\n\r\ncunning  of  some  300 years of  the  building  and\r\n\r\nrunning   of  the  British  Empire,  and   in   the\r\n\r\nmanipulation of men and their motivations  have  in\r\n\r\ngreat  part  led  to this curious  position,  daily\r\n\r\ngoing curiouser and curiouser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British, as I see it, had two objectives. The\r\n\r\nfirst objective was to engineer a collision between\r\n\r\nthe  non-Communist  Left  in  the  P.A.P. and  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Left  leadership in  the  unions.  Their\r\n\r\nsecond  objective  is  to ensure  that  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories are put into a position where they will\r\n\r\ncome  together  immediately in a  federation  under\r\n\r\nBritish  tutelage, but in a state of  readiness  if\r\n\r\nthe  international situation turns delicate  to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred to a nationalist government of \"Greater\r\n\r\nMalaysia\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the planners of this scheme for\r\n\r\nhaving succeeded thus far. Day by day, on the basis\r\n\r\nof  British  blandishments, manoeuvres,  hints  and\r\n\r\ngestures,  all parties - the Communists, the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  and  the  leaders  of  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories - have all been putting in stakes on  the\r\n\r\npoker  table, and they are mounting.  To  the \r\n\r\npro-Communists  in  Singapore, the  British  say,  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  and  are saying, that they are  liberal  and\r\n\r\ndemocratic, and that if they have released men from\r\n\r\nprison  to  be  Prime Ministers, and only  recently\r\n\r\nhave  done  so again in Nyasaland, then why  should\r\n\r\nthey want to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkeep detainees in gaol? It is darkly hinted that it\r\n\r\nis  the wicked Singapore Government that wanted  to\r\n\r\nkeep them in gaol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These insinuations started slowly. After the Hong\r\n\r\nLim by-election, they were intensified. The British\r\n\r\nwere  unhappy  that in Hong Lim the Communist  Left\r\n\r\nrallied to the P.A.P. united front. I emphasise the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. united front, and not the Communist  united\r\n\r\nfront.  So  some plan had to be devised  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. would come into collision with  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Left.  Dinner  parties,  cocktails   and\r\n\r\nluncheons  led  to friendly fraternisation  between\r\n\r\nthe  British  Lion  and Messrs.  Lim  Ching  Siong,\r\n\r\nWoodhull  and Company. The pro-Communists were  led\r\n\r\nto    believe   that   the   P.A.P. were   wicked\r\n\r\nobstructionists,  and that the  British,  wise  and\r\n\r\nstatesmanlike people were prepared even to envisage\r\n\r\na  new \"Left\" government emerging in Singapore even\r\n\r\nmore  Left than the P.A.P., provided their military\r\n\r\nbases  were not touched. What has happened is  that\r\n\r\nthe   British   have  become  their   own   \r\n\r\nagents-provocateur.  And  how  well they  have  succeeded!\r\n\r\nQuietly  and  insidiously they have instigated  the\r\n\r\npro-Communists to attempt the capture of  both  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Government  and  the  Party.   Young   and\r\n\r\ninexperienced  revolutionaries  were  so  taken  in\r\n\r\nthat,  in  a crisis, Lim Ching Siong, Woodhull  and\r\n\r\nFong Swee Suan looked up the U.K. Commissioner  for\r\n\r\nconsultations last Tuesday, the 18th, at Eden Hall,\r\n\r\nthe    home    of    the   British    imperialists'\r\n\r\nrepresentative. Sir, we felt that something curious\r\n\r\nwas going on and we therefore kept the residence of\r\n\r\nthe  U.K.  Commissioner under observation.  Lo  and\r\n\r\nbehold!    The    great    anti-colonialists    and\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries turned up for secret  consultations\r\n\r\nwith  the  British Lion. I am now  convinced,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  some  funny things are happening  when  in  a\r\n\r\nserious crisis this revolutionary trio, instead  of\r\n\r\ngetting   in  touch  with  the  P.A.P.,  got   into\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  the U.K. Commissioner  at  Eden\r\n\r\nHall. I therefore suggest that, having led the \r\n\r\npro-Communists  into  believing  that  a  non-Communist\r\n\r\nGovernment was no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlonger   necessary   and   that   a   pro-Communist\r\n\r\nGovernment was possible, obviously these  men  were\r\n\r\ngoing  to  try  and  capture  the  P.A.P. and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  And  the British may also  have  hoped\r\n\r\nthat under attack and threat of capture, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwould   fight   back  and  finally   suppress   the\r\n\r\nCommunists,  something they have so far  failed  in\r\n\r\npersuading the P.A.P. to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, to the P.A.P., the British had\r\n\r\nsuggested  that we should take firm action  against\r\n\r\nthe  mounting subversion. In fact, a  plan  was  to\r\n\r\nhave  been drawn up which would have culminated  in\r\n\r\nan   act   leading  to  open  collision  with   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  in which the P.A.P. either remained  in\r\n\r\noffice,  and so became committed forever to  defend\r\n\r\nBritish colonialism, or resigned, in which  case  a\r\n\r\nnon-Communist  Government not amenable  to  British\r\n\r\npressure would have been got rid off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Federation began to believe that\r\n\r\nthey  could  get  the Borneo territories,  together\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore,  merged into a larger  federation.\r\n\r\nThe  Tunku  came down to Singapore on 27th  May,  a\r\n\r\nweek  before National Day, and announced to a group\r\n\r\nof  foreign correspondents that he recognised  that\r\n\r\nthere  must  be closer political and economic  ties\r\n\r\nbetween the Federation of Malaya, Singapore and the\r\n\r\nthree Borneo territories. I responded on the 3rd of\r\n\r\nJune,  National Day, that on principle we  welcomed\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku's  plan  for  a  larger  federation,  if\r\n\r\nthereby merger between Singapore and the Federation\r\n\r\nwas made easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists, on the other hand, immediately\r\n\r\npropounded  that there was no need for independence\r\n\r\nthrough merger, and that the next step should be to\r\n\r\nabolish the Internal Security Council in order that\r\n\r\nthere  would  be expansion at all levels  of  human\r\n\r\nactivity on behalf of the Communist cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six trade unionists came out with statements\r\n\r\nopenly supporting the Communist line on the 2nd  of\r\n\r\nJune. 42 trade unions also supported this C.P. line\r\n\r\nand  literally  put  their  rubber  stamps  on  the\r\n\r\nstatement  to  this  effect without  convening  any\r\n\r\nmeetings  or consulting the rank and file.  On  the\r\n\r\n9th of June, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChairman,  the Leader of the House, announced  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government would demand complete  independence\r\n\r\nthrough merger with the Federation, or merger  with\r\n\r\na   larger  federation  when  Constitutional  talks\r\n\r\nreopen  in 1963. The P.A.P. which was not  amenable\r\n\r\nto  manipulation by the British, is not going to be\r\n\r\nmanipulated by the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took our stand and the battle then began. Three\r\n\r\ndays  after  the 9th of June, the Trade  Union  Six\r\n\r\ndemanded   immediate  release  of  the   detainees,\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the  reunification   of   trade\r\n\r\nunions, granting of citizenship rights to all those\r\n\r\nloyal to the anti-colonial struggle, Communists  or\r\n\r\nnon-Communists, and more freedom of speech,  Press,\r\n\r\nassembly  and  organisation for the advancement  of\r\n\r\nthe anti-colonial struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, two Governors and one High Commissioner\r\n\r\nflew  in from Borneo to add impetus and mystery  to\r\n\r\nthe   fast   developing  plot.  All  these   events\r\n\r\nincidentally  lent  credence to the  false  rumours\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. had  sold out  Singapore  to  an\r\n\r\nimperialist  plot. The U.K. Commissioner  left  for\r\n\r\nLondon; the Tunku and the Yang di-Pertuan Agong  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation went to Brunei. Everyone started his\r\n\r\nown  analysis and adopted his own counter measures.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for Anson said this was  all  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of the Anson by-election. But the Communist\r\n\r\nLeft believed differently and decided that this was\r\n\r\nan evil conspiracy to which the P.A.P. was a party.\r\n\r\nThey  mounted  the offensive and intensified  their\r\n\r\ncampaign.  The Trade Union Six openly attacked  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.;  three Political Secretaries in receipt  of\r\n\r\nGovernment remuneration flagrantly flouted all  the\r\n\r\nrules  of decency and attacked the Government  they\r\n\r\nhad  promised  to serve. 43 trade unions  came  out\r\n\r\nagainst  merger supporting the Trade Union  Six  to\r\n\r\nmake  the  P.A.P. lose in Anson. Finally,  when  in\r\n\r\nspite of everything the P.A.P. looked like winning,\r\n\r\nthey  engineered the betrayal of the Party by eight\r\n\r\nAssemblymen issuing a statement of discord  on  the\r\n\r\neve  of  polls.  These people had been  duped  into\r\n\r\nbelieving  that the P.A.P. had sold out the  rights\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will take some time for me to tell you the\r\n\r\nstory  right from the beginning, and the story  may\r\n\r\nhave  to be continued to be told, over a period  of\r\n\r\ntime. But I feel the people must know the truth  in\r\n\r\norder  that  when the mandate is returned  to  them\r\n\r\nthey can make their choice in full knowledge of the\r\n\r\nfacts.  And  the choice will be - do  you  want  your\r\n\r\nfuture to be a Singapore merged with the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya, or do you want to follow people who ask\r\n\r\nfirst  for  the abolition of the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil,   as   a  first  step  to  an  independent\r\n\r\nCommunist Singapore? We saw these problems  looming\r\n\r\nover  the  horizon  even whilst the  Hong  Lim \r\n\r\nby-election was on, and I stressed over and over again\r\n\r\nwhy  the  P.A.P. does not stand for an  independent\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  why our future must  lie  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Ching Siong and his friends took fright and alarm when rapid developments began regarding\r\n\r\nmerger.  They  were alarmed because  merger  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  a  mirage over the horizon  but  a  reality\r\n\r\nwhich  will  take place in 1963. Two Governors  and\r\n\r\none  High  Commissioner  arrived  from  Borneo   to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  matters  with Lord Selkirk.  Lord  Selkirk\r\n\r\nreturned  to  London to discuss  matters  with  his\r\n\r\nGovernment in London. The Tunku and the Agong  went\r\n\r\nto  Brunei,  and the Tunku went on to Sarawak.  The\r\n\r\nTunku   made  a  broadcast  on  the  4th  of   July\r\n\r\nannouncing that he would take Brunei in as a  State\r\n\r\nof  the Federation, together with North Borneo  and\r\n\r\nSarawak.  On  the 11th of July at a Rotary  dinner,\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku  said he would hold talks with Singapore\r\n\r\nas to how Singapore should come in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do they oppose this merger? Why do they want\r\n\r\nto  capture the Government and the Party to prevent\r\n\r\nthis  when for years they have always endorsed  and\r\n\r\nsupported  the P.A.P. plan of independence  through\r\n\r\nmerger? Mr Lim Ching Siong, Mr Woodhull, Mr Fong\r\n\r\ncame  out  from  prison  because  we  had  won  the\r\n\r\nelections  and  had  demanded their  release  as  a\r\n\r\ncondition  precedent  before  we  assumed   office.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we  knew  that politically  our  opinions\r\n\r\ndiffered on important points of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nideology from some of them, we were openly comrades\r\n\r\nin  a united front and we did not betray them.  But\r\n\r\nthey,  on  the other hand, in the middle of  a \r\n\r\nby-election  which was crucial to the Government,  and\r\n\r\nfor  the purpose of giving the P.A.P. a mandate for\r\n\r\nmerger,  for their own reasons, betrayed us  openly\r\n\r\nat  Anson, caused dissension in the Party ranks and\r\n\r\nconfusion in the minds of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the battle lines have already been\r\n\r\ndrawn  and forces drawn up on each side. A  strange\r\n\r\ntwist  of  events has taken place  in  Borneo.  The\r\n\r\npeople  of Sarawak, it appears, do not want  merger\r\n\r\nas  a  State  with  the  Federation  as  the  Tunku\r\n\r\nsuggested.  Neither, it appears, do the  people  of\r\n\r\nNorth Borneo in which no single political party yet\r\n\r\nexists. The British Governors talked of support for\r\n\r\n\"Greater  Malaysia\" but only as a  long-term  plan.\r\n\r\nThe  Tunku was angered at this turn of events,  and\r\n\r\nnow  openly attacked British colonialism which  has\r\n\r\nput  a stumbling block in the plan for merger of  a\r\n\r\nlarger  federation. And ten Malayan  officers  were\r\n\r\nbeing  intimidated and chased out of Brunei because\r\n\r\nit   is  believed  and  said  that  British  police\r\n\r\nofficers  were dilatory in protecting the  physical\r\n\r\nsafety of the Malayan officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, because \"Greater Malaysia\" had been\r\n\r\npresented  to  the  people of Brunei,  Sarawak  and\r\n\r\nNorth Borneo as a Federation colonising effort, the\r\n\r\nthree  territories  have  for  the  first  time  in\r\n\r\nhistory  come together voluntarily on  the  British\r\n\r\nplan of a Borneo federation. I congratulate the men\r\n\r\nwho  charted this course of events if, in fact, all\r\n\r\nthese  were  intended. The British are now  getting\r\n\r\nthe three Borneo territories together for the first\r\n\r\ntime  into a federation, after they have failed  so\r\n\r\nfar in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the British supported the Tunku's plan\r\n\r\nfor  \"Greater Malaysia\" on principle, but they  had\r\n\r\nalways said that the Borneo territories must form a\r\n\r\nfederation first before they merge with Malaya.  As\r\n\r\nfar   as  the  Borneo  territories  are  concerned,\r\n\r\ntherefore, the British have got everyone  well  and\r\n\r\nhappy,  except  probably the  ten  anxious  Malayan\r\n\r\nofficers in Brunei.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile in Singapore they have succeeded in\r\n\r\nbeguiling the pro-C.P. elements into believing that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. had sold them out and encouraging  them\r\n\r\nto  openly attack and betray the P.A.P. in Anson by\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that  there could be a government  even\r\n\r\nmore  Left than the P.A.P. The British were  happy,\r\n\r\nfor  they  thought  that after this  collision  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. would have to take strong measures to ensure\r\n\r\nits survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, day by day the chips on the poker table are\r\n\r\nmounting. The game as has been played has  gone  so\r\n\r\nfar  now  that no side can afford to back out,  and\r\n\r\nsome  time  in  the near future all cards  will  be\r\n\r\ncalled  and  seen.  Whoever is bluffing  will  lose\r\n\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now say on behalf of my colleagues and my Party\r\n\r\nthat we are not going to fit in with the scheme  to\r\n\r\nbeat  up  the  C.P. for  the  benefit  of  British\r\n\r\ncolonialism.  If  we  get no  independence  through\r\n\r\nmerger,   we  will  leave  the  British  with   the\r\n\r\npredicament  of having to deal with the  Communists\r\n\r\nthemselves, even in an elected government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists, on the other hand, have mounted\r\n\r\ntheir  offensive  in  order to capture  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nParty  and the P.A.P. Government. Needless to  say,\r\n\r\nwe  shall  resist them to prevent  this  from  ever\r\n\r\nhappening. We advise them not to try it and not  to\r\n\r\nprovoke us into unnecessary collision. If they want\r\n\r\nto  win and take over power in Singapore, they  may\r\n\r\ntry to do so in the next general elections. We,  on\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  must let  the  people  know  the\r\n\r\ntruth - plain, simple, unvarnished - so that  all  will\r\n\r\nrealise the hazardous course they will travel  with\r\n\r\nthese men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our battle with the Communists must be won by\r\n\r\nargument and in the hearts and minds of the people.\r\n\r\nWe  will prove that the democratic socialist forces\r\n\r\nin  Singapore are honest and sincere to the people,\r\n\r\nand  have not sold out and will not sell out  their\r\n\r\nrights  to anybody. It will also be shown that  the\r\n\r\nCommunists have not only been duped by the  British\r\n\r\nbut  duped  to the extent that they betrayed  their\r\n\r\nP.A.P. comrades  in  the nationalist  Left  united\r\n\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say the battle for men's minds cannot be won by\r\n\r\nsimple  smearing  of  a  man  being  either  \r\n\r\nanti-Communist,   reactionary,   wavering   bourgeoisie,\r\n\r\nSocial Democrat or Communist. As I said, the battle\r\n\r\nfor  men's minds cannot be won by simple labelling.\r\n\r\nNot   all   those  who  oppose  the   British   are\r\n\r\nnationalists.     Some    anti-colonialists     are\r\n\r\nnationalists and some are Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also see this distinction that not all who\r\n\r\noppose   the  P.A.P. are  Communists;   some   are\r\n\r\nCommunists,  some reactionaries, some  opportunists\r\n\r\nand some merely confused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in this battle for ideas, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  that we should call a spade a spade  and\r\n\r\nput  across  truthfully the respective position  of\r\n\r\neveryone. Our purpose is to build a movement for  a\r\n\r\nunited,   independent,  democratic,   non-Communist\r\n\r\nMalaya.  Our business is to strengthen  the  forces\r\n\r\nthat help to create this united Malaya. In the past\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  may  have for  their  own  reasons\r\n\r\nassisted us in this task. If so, they did it in the\r\n\r\nfull  knowledge that we are non-Communist, and  not\r\n\r\nCommunist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are firmly convinced that the survival of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. depends on a strong adherence to this  line\r\n\r\nof  non-Communism  to  prevent  perversion  of  our\r\n\r\nParty,  either  by the British getting  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ninto  openly repressing the Communists, or  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  in  making the P.A.P. the  vehicle  of\r\n\r\ntheir Communist line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the game has been played so far, beyond any\r\n\r\ndoubt  the really able and skilful player has  been\r\n\r\nthe  British.  Even we, Mr Speaker, Sir,  were  at\r\n\r\nfirst  puzzled  by  this  strange  development   of\r\n\r\nevents. On the one hand, we were asked to be  tough\r\n\r\nand  to  take firm action. On the other  hand,  the\r\n\r\nBritish  lion was asking the revolutionary  Messrs.\r\n\r\nLim  and Woodhull & Co, to dinner and telling  them\r\n\r\nthat   all  the  detainees  can  be  let  out,   or\r\n\r\nsuggesting to them that that could be so. And  then\r\n\r\ntheir  fellow-travelling friends come and  tell  us\r\n\r\nthat  they, the revolutionaries, have a first-class\r\n\r\npipe-line   with  the  U.K.  Commission   and   are\r\n\r\nconvinced that all that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish  wanted in Singapore were their  bases  and\r\n\r\nquiet,  peace  and  tranquillity,  and  even  if  a\r\n\r\nCommunist government can be popularly elected,  all\r\n\r\nwould be well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all sides the events of the last two months\r\n\r\nhave  been irrevocable ones. Such conflicts as have\r\n\r\nappeared  between  the pro-C.P. elements  and  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. cannot  just be laughed off and  forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe British are still hoping that we will come into\r\n\r\nopen  collision  and  that we  will  use  draconian\r\n\r\nmethods  of suppression to establish our  position.\r\n\r\nBut  as  I  have explained, Sir, we are  completely\r\n\r\nunmoved  by  considerations of staying  in  office,\r\n\r\npomp   or   power,   for   these   were   not   the\r\n\r\nconsiderations that made us seek office in 1959. We\r\n\r\ncan,    therefore,   afford   to    ignore    these\r\n\r\nblandishments  and  present  to  the  British   the\r\n\r\ndragon's teeth that they have been sowing.  But  we\r\n\r\nshall fight to prevent the Government and the Party\r\n\r\nfrom capture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many ways the events of the last two months\r\n\r\nbear  resemblance to the crisis in  the  P.A.P. in\r\n\r\n1957.  There again the pro-Communist Left, whom  we\r\n\r\nhad  called  Left-Wing  adventurers,  miscalculated\r\n\r\ntheir position and tried to capture the P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nforce  us  to follow their line. Very prudently  we\r\n\r\ncalculated  differently and abstained from  office,\r\n\r\nthereby  saving  the P.A.P. and ourselves  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of unnecessary trouble. As a result, we  were\r\n\r\nable to survive, grow to greater strength and later\r\n\r\nsucceed in the last General Elections and were able\r\n\r\nthereby  to  rescue Mr Lim, Mr Woodhull  and  six\r\n\r\nothers from prison, before we assumed power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now again in 1961, as in 1957, it is believed that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. can be captured by Communists and  used\r\n\r\nfor  Communist policies with impunity. Some of  the\r\n\r\nlesser souls in our Party have decided to take  the\r\n\r\neasy way out - this shortcut to peace in our time and\r\n\r\npopularity in our time. Little do they realise that\r\n\r\nthis  short-cut can only lead to peace only  for  a\r\n\r\ntime and popularity only for a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided to stay and not abdicate to\r\n\r\nprevent  this criminal folly from being perpetrated\r\n\r\non the P.A.P. for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  second  time. I only hope these gamblers  will\r\n\r\nnot  have  to pay too high and bitter a price  when\r\n\r\nthe cards are opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask these gentlemen of the Communist Left to\r\n\r\nstop and ponder on the adventure they are about  to\r\n\r\nembark on. We the P.A.P. have never betrayed  them.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we  never  agreed with their  ideological\r\n\r\nposition,  yet because we were in one anti-colonial\r\n\r\nfront  and  they landed in gaol, the non-Communists\r\n\r\nin the P.A.P. carried on, won the General Elections\r\n\r\nin 1959, and secured their release. We were able to\r\n\r\ndo  this  only because we were wise enough  not  to\r\n\r\nfall  into  a  trap  in  1957 when  some  Left-wing\r\n\r\nadventurers  tried  to capture the  Party.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, the pro-Communists have been duped  by\r\n\r\nthe  British. Having wined and dined with the lion,\r\n\r\nthey are convinced that the lion will not eat them.\r\n\r\nIt   is   our  intention  that  as  long   as   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional position remains as it  is,  and  no\r\n\r\nriots  and  no  violence take place  requiring  the\r\n\r\nintervention   of   British  troops   and   British\r\n\r\ngenerals,   the   P.A.P. will  allow   them   full\r\n\r\nopportunities for free and open debate, leading  if\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  a  victory  for  them  in  the  next\r\n\r\nelection. It is for them to decide what course they\r\n\r\nare to embark upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the detainees arrested by the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government  and still  in  detention,  my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Leader of the House, will be  making\r\n\r\na statement. We intend to get this irrelevant issue\r\n\r\nout  of  the  political scene by  implementing  the\r\n\r\nmemorandum  which  we  submitted  to  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council in August 1959, for the continued\r\n\r\nreleases  in batches of all the detainees, arrested\r\n\r\nin  two purges in 1956 and 1957 in which the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwas involved. As a result of the turn of events, we\r\n\r\nare  convinced  that it is in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  to get this issue out of the way, so  that\r\n\r\nthe real issue, merger, is not clouded over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On merger, let me repeat what the Party Chairman\r\n\r\nhas   said - that  we  stand  for  merger  in   1963,\r\n\r\nindependence through merger either direct with  the\r\n\r\nFederation alone or together with the three  Borneo\r\n\r\nStates  on  the  terms that there should  be  local\r\n\r\nautonomy  on education and labour. There have  been\r\n\r\nno details agreed upon; there have been no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecret  deals.  I  hope  at a  convenient  time  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  these matters with the Tunku on the  basis\r\n\r\nfor  merger.  When  the terms  and  conditions  are\r\n\r\nformulated,  it is our intention not  only  to  get\r\n\r\nthis  House  to  support it, but to get  the  whole\r\n\r\ncountry to endorse it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of reckoning is fast approaching,\r\n\r\npartly  by British design, partly by miscalculation\r\n\r\nand  the gullibility of people who are supposed  to\r\n\r\nbe  politically  intelligent  revolutionaries.  The\r\n\r\ncards have been dealt out and gone out to them, and\r\n\r\nthe  game  must  come  to its  conclusion.  Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain how we are going to play this game  on  our\r\n\r\nside.  First, we intend to win the game not  merely\r\n\r\nfor  the  immediate present but for  the  long-term\r\n\r\nfuture.   We  are  concerned  not  so   much   with\r\n\r\nimmediately  remaining in office, but in  preparing\r\n\r\nthe conditions for merger and presenting the issues\r\n\r\nto  the people so that ultimately they can make the\r\n\r\nright choice on their future in full possession  of\r\n\r\nall  the  facts. I stated in October 1959, in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that as long as British power is supreme  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  in  any  conflict  between  the   armed\r\n\r\nCommunists and the armed colonialists we  must  opt\r\n\r\nout.  We  have only limited arms - a Police Force,  a\r\n\r\nsmall  S.I.R. unit and a couple  of  riot  squads.\r\n\r\nViolence and unrest which the Communists can  mount\r\n\r\non  a  scale that will require the intervention  of\r\n\r\nBritish troops and the taking over of command by  a\r\n\r\nBritish  general  must mean that  we  abdicate,  or\r\n\r\notherwise be labelled stooges of a colonial regime.\r\n\r\nIt  is therefore a matter for the Communist-Left to\r\n\r\ndecide  whether they want to get us out by bringing\r\n\r\nabout  this  situation. But since their  adversary,\r\n\r\nthe British Lion, has led them to believe that they\r\n\r\nwill be left secure and that they will be given the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  the island, obviously some irrevocable\r\n\r\ndecisions  must already have been made by  them  on\r\n\r\nthe strength of this belief. Obviously also, nearly\r\n\r\nthree  years  of  meditation  in  prison  have  not\r\n\r\nbrought   about   that  maturity  of  revolutionary\r\n\r\njudgment  which is, I think, required of those  who\r\n\r\nembark on perilous schemes for the acquisition even\r\n\r\nof limited power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is strange that both the British colonialists\r\n\r\nand the Communists should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  come to a common conclusion, that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nno  longer serves any political purpose. What  they\r\n\r\nmean  is that the P.A.P. is no longer of any  value\r\n\r\nfrom  their respective points of view for  purposes\r\n\r\nof  manipulation, either by the British or  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  Hence  the British talked  of  liberal\r\n\r\nrights to Messrs. Lim Ching Siong, Woodhull &  Co.;\r\n\r\nof  the British being in favour of releasing people\r\n\r\nand encouraging the Communist Left to make more and\r\n\r\nmore demands on the P.A.P. leading to a bid to take\r\n\r\nover the Government and the Party, knowing that  in\r\n\r\nthat  event  the  P.A.P. would have  to  fight  the\r\n\r\nCommunists for its survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat once more clearly that the\r\n\r\nonly  way to independence is through merger. We  do\r\n\r\nnot  intend to take repressive actions against  the\r\n\r\nCommunists   just   for   the   benefit   of    the\r\n\r\ncolonialists.  It  is our business  to  try,  under\r\n\r\nconditions of absolute safety for the life and limb\r\n\r\nof  every  political contestant to win the argument\r\n\r\nfor the political future of Singapore in the hearts\r\n\r\nand minds of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the P.A.P. we are concerned with two\r\n\r\nthings - the interest of the people of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nof  the Federation whom we consider to be one,  and\r\n\r\nnext  the  interest of the P.A.P. as  a  means  of\r\n\r\nbringing about a democratic socialist society.  The\r\n\r\nBritish,  having  been  unable  to  manipulate  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  naturally are prepared to see it destroyed\r\n\r\nand  have decided with diabolical cynicism  to  use\r\n\r\nthe  Communist Party as their tool. Their objective\r\n\r\nnow  is to put the P.A.P. in a spot where it either\r\n\r\nhas  to  suppress  the C.P.,  or  be  devoured  and\r\n\r\ncaptured by it peacefully by the technique of smear\r\n\r\nand  silent  intimidation. However, I  believe  the\r\n\r\nParty  and its stalwarts are sufficiently stout  at\r\n\r\nheart and mind, and fortunately have foreseen  such\r\n\r\neventualities.  We  have  our  own  safeguards  and\r\n\r\ndefences.  The  question  of  suppression  of   all\r\n\r\nCommunists we leave to the wisdom of the Communists\r\n\r\nas  a  matter  between them and the British.  Since\r\n\r\nthey  apparently have become good  friends  I  wish\r\n\r\nthem  well in their new fraternisation. However,  I\r\n\r\nfear  that in due course of time both parties  will\r\n\r\nend up in mutual humiliation and betrayal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the very moment the Communists decided that\r\n\r\nsuper-merger was a plot of the British  imperialist\r\n\r\nin   conjunction   with  what   they   called   the\r\n\r\n\"feudalists\" in the Federation aided and abetted by\r\n\r\nwhat  they called the \"wavering bourgeois\"  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in  Singapore,  they  decided  to  destroy\r\n\r\nsupport for it. Their fear is that this was a  trap\r\n\r\nto  keep  them permanently in a state  of  constant\r\n\r\nsuppression. And they have been led to believe, not\r\n\r\nleast  I  suggest by the British, that  a  colonial\r\n\r\nSingapore  without the I.S.C. is preferable  to  an\r\n\r\nindependent  greater  Malaya or  Greater  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nWith  British blandishments they believe that under\r\n\r\ncolonialism and without the I.S.C. they  will  have\r\n\r\nmore  freedom  of action than under an  independent\r\n\r\nunited Malayan government. Sir, it is not for me to\r\n\r\nfathom  the tortuous depths of their minds.  But  I\r\n\r\nsay  that those who believe in the proposition that\r\n\r\nmore  freedom  is available for the advancement  of\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  cause by having  a  colonial \r\n\r\nself-governing  Singapore  than by having  Singapore  as\r\n\r\npart  of Greater Malaysia or of the Federation  are\r\n\r\nmen  whose  political maturity is very much  to  be\r\n\r\ndoubted, and whose claim to be revolutionary heroes\r\n\r\nwill  be disproved and discarded by the harsh  test\r\n\r\nof  time. Good revolutionaries are not men who fall\r\n\r\ninto  traps  set by their enemies and  get  excited\r\n\r\nwhen   they  see  British  Governors  arriving   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to discuss super-merger, and the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  Commissioner leaving Singapore for  London\r\n\r\nto discuss matters with the Imperial Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the democratic socialists with less dogma\r\n\r\nand  theoretical blinkers were better able  to  see\r\n\r\nthrough  this maze of events and were less agitated\r\n\r\nand jumpy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young socialists in the University of Malaya\r\n\r\nthought  super-merger a trap. I think in  the  next\r\n\r\nfew months it is likely to be proved that they,  in\r\n\r\nfact, had fallen into a trap, a British trap to get\r\n\r\nthem  to oppose both super-merger and merger.  From\r\n\r\nthis  trap  they  will  find  great  difficulty  in\r\n\r\nextricating themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is so much to tell on so many things that I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  better that we take things  step  by\r\n\r\nstep. The drama of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  last few weeks which has led to this new phase\r\n\r\nin  the political life of Singapore will move  with\r\n\r\nincreasing  rapidity to a crescendo. As it  unfolds\r\n\r\nitself,  the  people  of  Singapore  and   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  will see the under-current  forces  for\r\n\r\nthemselves and they will have to decide  what  they\r\n\r\nwish  to  make  of their country, their  homes  and\r\n\r\ntheir lives. Our duty is to preserve the P.A.P. in\r\n\r\nthe  midst  of zig-zagging policies and opportunist\r\n\r\nmanoeuvring  by  the  Right as  well  as  from  the\r\n\r\nCommunist Left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the beacon which lights up the road to an\r\n\r\nindependent  democratic  non-Communist  Malaya   in\r\n\r\nwhich the races will live in peace and harmony with\r\n\r\neach  other  and build out of our multi-racial  and\r\n\r\nmulti-linguistic  peoples one Malayan  people,  one\r\n\r\ncommon  destiny  for us all in  this  part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  Perhaps  at  some future  date  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories may find themselves drawn towards us by\r\n\r\nthe  very  logistics of the political situation  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia. These events may take place faster\r\n\r\nthan have been envisaged a year ago. It is our duty\r\n\r\nas a political party to hasten tendencies which are\r\n\r\nto the benefit of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion\r\n\r\nstanding in my name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the Prime Minister has very aptly outlined\r\n\r\nto  the  House the course of political developments\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. I have little more to add to what he\r\n\r\nhas  said  excepting to bring out and to  reiterate\r\n\r\nthe   stand  of  the  P.A.P.  Government  over  the\r\n\r\ndetention  of  those  who  were  arrested  by   the\r\n\r\nprevious Government in two purges, in October  1956\r\n\r\nand  August  1957.  I  would like  to  restate  our\r\n\r\nposition  so that it will be clear in the minds  of\r\n\r\nthe  people,  in  the minds of even the  detainees,\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. was sincere in working for  their\r\n\r\nrelease in the Internal Security Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 22nd May, 1959, during the election campaign,  I\r\n\r\nstated that the P.A.P. would not take office unless\r\n\r\nformer  members  of the Party who  were  intimately\r\n\r\nconnected with the Central\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee and who are now  in  gaol  are\r\n\r\nreleased.  This  pledge  we have  fulfilled.  Eight\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members, all those intimately connected with\r\n\r\nthe  leadership of the Party, were released at  our\r\n\r\ninsistence on 4th June before we assumed office  on\r\n\r\n5th  June. These eight persons were released before\r\n\r\nthe   Internal  Security  Council   was   set   up.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, orders for the release of  the  other\r\n\r\ndetainees  were  made  in batches,  but  after  two\r\n\r\nbatches   were  released,  the  Internal   Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  challenged  the policy  of  indiscriminate\r\n\r\nrelease. As a result, a memorandum recommending the\r\n\r\nrelease  of  these detainees was submitted  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  to  the  Internal   Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  dated 12th August, 1959, two months  after\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. had assumed power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote the relevant extract from this paper\r\n\r\ndefining  the  Singapore Government's  policy  with\r\n\r\nregard to the present detainees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As early as October 1956, the P.A.P. saw clearly\r\n\r\nthat it would be necessary, if and when it won  the\r\n\r\nelections,  to  release those  detainees  who  were\r\n\r\nclosely  associated  with  the  Party.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion highly charged with emotion. Whether these\r\n\r\nmen  were Communists or not is irrelevant  when  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  justifying the position  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment in the eyes of the people, and the smear\r\n\r\nto  which the P.A.P. Government would be opened, if\r\n\r\nthese men remained in jail and the P.A.P. in power,\r\n\r\nis one which cannot be lightly dismissed.' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Other\r\n\r\nthan  such cases, in the eyes of the neutral public\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.

These were the  two  purges  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the P.A.P. was involved. In the other  cases\r\n\r\nwhere suspects were picked up and unconnected  with\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P.,   the  present  Government   has   no\r\n\r\nobligation  to  them  whatsoever,  and  the  public\r\n\r\n(other than Communist sympathisers) does not expect\r\n\r\nthe Government to do anything about them.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were altogether 61 persons detained on 2nd\r\n\r\nJune, 1959.

Of  those  who  were  detained  by   the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government in the two purges of 1956  and\r\n\r\n1957,  there  are now only 18 persons  still  under\r\n\r\ndetention. It is vital that the continued detention\r\n\r\nof  these  18  detainees should not be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nobscure  the main issue in the minds of the people,\r\n\r\nand    that    is   the   political    future    of\r\n\r\nSingapore - whether  we  are to  attain  independence\r\n\r\nthrough  merger with the Federation in 1963  either\r\n\r\nwith or without the Borneo territories, or whether,\r\n\r\nas  has  been  suggested by Mr Lim  Ching  Siong's\r\n\r\ngroup,  the next step should not be merger  but  an\r\n\r\ninternally  self-governing  Singapore  without  the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to lay on the Table the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment's Paper to the Internal Security Council\r\n\r\ndated 12th August, 1959, for the information of the\r\n\r\nHouse.  I  would  like to make it  known  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  has  written  to  the   U.K.\r\n\r\nCommissioner  about our intention to  release  this\r\n\r\nmemorandum  by  the  Singapore  Government  to  the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security Council and has asked  the  U.K.\r\n\r\nCommissioner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  inform  the Federation Government. I understand\r\n\r\nthat the U.K. Commissioner has registered a protest\r\n\r\nagainst publication of this paper. However, in  the\r\n\r\nlight  of  recent  developments  which  have   been\r\n\r\noutlined  by  the Prime Minister to the  House,  to\r\n\r\nremove  all  doubts  and any vestige  of  suspicion\r\n\r\nabout  the  sincerity of the P.A.P.  Government  in\r\n\r\nwanting  to  release these detainees,  we  have  no\r\n\r\nalternative hut feel compelled that the whole truth\r\n\r\nshould be made known to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of the question of merger so\r\n\r\noutweighs  all  other considerations  that  we  are\r\n\r\nanxious that this side issue of continued detention\r\n\r\nof the detainees should be immediately resolved and\r\n\r\nnot  be  allowed to be used as an argument  against\r\n\r\nmerger.  Notwithstanding the stand of  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the Internal Security  Council,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  will issue  orders  for  the\r\n\r\nrelease  of the detainees in batches from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime  in  accordance with the original proposal  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government to the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil. In doing so, I would like to clarify  that\r\n\r\nit is not the desire of the Singapore Government to\r\n\r\nprecipitate  any  conflict  or  crisis   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government with whom it has always  been\r\n\r\nour  policy  to  maintain  amicable  and  brotherly\r\n\r\nrelationship in the interest of the people of  both\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of memorandum dated 12th August, 1959,\r\n\r\nrecommending  release of detainees  submitted  by\r\n\r\nSingapore Government to Internal Security Council\r\n\r\nhanded in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it that the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  no objection to these  copies  being\r\n\r\ndistributed now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I have no objection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies distributed to hon.

Either the Government  is\r\n\r\nseeking  unanimous support from both sides  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  on an issue of national importance and above\r\n\r\nparty  politics, or there is dissension within  the\r\n\r\nranks of the Government majority. As we have as yet\r\n\r\nno  occasion to debate any issue that is considered\r\n\r\nof  national importance and above party politics in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly,  the  second  possibility  must  be\r\n\r\nviewed with seriousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I therefore crave your\r\n\r\nindulgence  to hear me speak on matters  which  you\r\n\r\nmight  consider highly politic. With 39 Assemblymen\r\n\r\non  the Government Benches in a House of 51 seats - I\r\n\r\nbeg  your  pardon,  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  52  seats - I\r\n\r\nconsider   it  inappropriate  that  a   motion   of\r\n\r\nconfidence  should  have  been  brought  into  this\r\n\r\nHouse. If it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerely  to  find  out how Government  Members  will\r\n\r\nvote,  surely  the Whip will be the person  in  the\r\n\r\nbest position to advise the Prime Minister, and the\r\n\r\nmotion therefore becomes meaningless. I cannot  and\r\n\r\nwill not believe that the Prime Minister is seeking\r\n\r\nsupport  from  the  Opposition  Benches.   In   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the intention and the implication of\r\n\r\nthe  motion becomes quite clear, particularly  with\r\n\r\nthe  publication of the exchange of letters between\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister on\r\n\r\nthe  subject  of  the  Prime  Ministership  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  yesterday's newspapers.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister concluded his letter by saying - I quote the\r\n\r\nStraits Times of yesterday:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am quite prepared to assume leadership of the\r\n\r\ngovernment  on behalf of the party provided  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  clear wish of the party executive and  of  the\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  who  will  have  to  follow  us   into\r\n\r\nbattle.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The Deputy Prime Minister's reply was endorsed only\r\n\r\nby   the   remaining  13  members  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nExecutive   Committee.   This   motion   makes   it\r\n\r\ninescapable  for Government Members to endorse  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister's reply in the open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some of us on this side of the\r\n\r\nHouse  take exception to such methods and  also  to\r\n\r\ncertain  statements and implications  contained  in\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister's letter. Many of us  on  this\r\n\r\nside   of  the  House  are  here  not  for  selfish\r\n\r\nobjectives or for ulterior motives. We  are  not  a\r\n\r\nloose  and  feudalistic  conglomeration  of  people\r\n\r\nseeking selfish and opportunistic ends. We are here\r\n\r\nbecause  we  believe  in a political  system  which\r\n\r\nseeks  to eliminate the exploitation of man by  man\r\n\r\nand the building of a more egalitarian society.  We\r\n\r\nall came into this House bearing our sacrifices and\r\n\r\nwith  only one single motive - to serve and  to  help\r\n\r\nour fellowmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of us feel that it is impossible for us\r\n\r\nto unconditionally associate ourselves with some of\r\n\r\nthe  sentiments  expressed in the Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nletter to the Deputy Prime Minister of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  17th of July. We feel, therefore, that  it  is\r\n\r\nequally impossible for us to give our unconditional\r\n\r\nsupport to the Prime Minister if he is to pursue  a\r\n\r\npolicy with which we cannot fully agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no hesitation in stating my belief\r\n\r\nthat  the Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues\r\n\r\nare the most able persons in this Assembly - nay,  in\r\n\r\nthe  whole  of  Singapore - to lead  us  towards  our\r\n\r\npolitical  objectives. I would  have  been  equally\r\n\r\nunhesitating in giving them my full confidence  had\r\n\r\npolitical  events not taken a sudden  turn  in  the\r\n\r\nlast few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before the House itself is distasteful\r\n\r\nto  me  and  to  many  of my comrades,  because  we\r\n\r\nconsider  it  to be nothing but party politics  and\r\n\r\nshould not concern the Legislative Assembly.  Party\r\n\r\npolitics  and differences of opinion between  Party\r\n\r\nAssemblymen and Party members should be and must be\r\n\r\nthrashed  out  at  party  level.  Where  there   is\r\n\r\ndissension  within the Party, surely the  cause  of\r\n\r\nsuch discord should be democratically debated to  a\r\n\r\nmutually  satisfactory conclusion within the  Party\r\n\r\nwhich  accepts democracy and socialism as its  main\r\n\r\npillars  and  its main political basic beliefs.  To\r\n\r\nbring party politics into the Assembly means not  a\r\n\r\nloss  of  confidence of the Party  Assemblymen  and\r\n\r\nParty  members  in the collective  leadership  but,\r\n\r\nSir,  on  the  contrary,  it  means  the  loss   of\r\n\r\nconfidence of the collective leadership in some  of\r\n\r\nthe Assemblymen who represent the majority view  in\r\n\r\nthe  Party. Can we, the second rung leaders of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party, vote for this  motion  and\r\n\r\nassociate  ourselves with the collective leadership\r\n\r\nto  indicate the loss of confidence in our comrades\r\n\r\nin the rank and file who have worked tirelessly and\r\n\r\nwith  complete  disregard for  their  own  personal\r\n\r\nsafety  and interests to put us into this Assembly?\r\n\r\nIn   the   Enright  affair,  the  Party  collective\r\n\r\nleadership enunciated the policy, and rightly  too,\r\n\r\nbut   with   uncalled  for  arrogance,  that   only\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  may participate  in  Singapore\r\n\r\npolitics. May I, Mr Speaker, Sir, also plead  with\r\n\r\nhumility and with sincerity that only Party members\r\n\r\nbe allowed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  party  politics?  To  invite   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to  participate in party  politics,  as\r\n\r\nthis   motion   has   obviously   called   for   by\r\n\r\nimplication,  would be tantamount  to  surrendering\r\n\r\nthe  rights  and  privileges of  Party  members  to\r\n\r\nMembers  of the Opposition without apportioning  to\r\n\r\nthem  the duties, the responsibilities and the hard\r\n\r\nwork  that  is  expected  of  every  single  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmember.  It breaks my heart, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  to\r\n\r\nsay  such blunt things to the collective leadership\r\n\r\nand  in  particular to the Prime Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister who have both been my mentors\r\n\r\nand  political tutors and whom I regard  with  deep\r\n\r\nrespect  and affection. Political convictions  must\r\n\r\ncome  before  personalities and before  sentiments,\r\n\r\nand  I  am left with no alternative but to  let  my\r\n\r\nhead rule my heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as this motion before the House\r\n\r\nis  intimately  associated  with  the  exchange  of\r\n\r\nletters  between the Prime Minister and the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister published in yesterday's newspapers,\r\n\r\nI  feel  obliged to make two comments on the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's letter. I am deeply disturbed, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister should deem it fit to  put  the\r\n\r\ncap  of  the  Communist Left on the  heads  of  all\r\n\r\nsocialists  who  disagree with  him.  I  also  feel\r\n\r\ngravely  concerned, Sir, that he should imply  that\r\n\r\nall  those  who have expressed doubts or  harboured\r\n\r\nsuspicion  about the Tunku's grand design  are  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Left  or  are  Communist  stooges.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I state here categorically  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse   that  I  stand  for  the  merger  and   the\r\n\r\nunification  of  Singapore and  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  It  is  by a cruel and deliberate  act  of\r\n\r\ncolonialism  that  we  stand  isolated   from   our\r\n\r\nhinterland,  very  much  as  a  new-born  babe   is\r\n\r\nsnatched away from its mother overflowing with  the\r\n\r\nmilk  of human kindness. We all believe that merger\r\n\r\nas   a   historical   event   is   inevitable   and\r\n\r\ninescapable. And in all our Party statements before\r\n\r\nthe  elections  we  stated in the most  categorical\r\n\r\nterms that merger is the long-term objective of the\r\n\r\nParty. We explained in a great deal of detail that\r\n\r\nthe Alliance Government is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanti-merger because of the one million  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  because of the  Leftist  danger  or\r\n\r\nmenace in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two years of government the P.A.P. has not\r\n\r\nchanged any of these two facts. Suddenly the  Tunku\r\n\r\nwith  colonial connivance calls for a super merger.\r\n\r\nSurely,  Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot be reprimanded\r\n\r\nfor  harbouring doubts and suspicion.  Being  loyal\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the People's Action Party and  members\r\n\r\nwith  full confidence in the collective leadership,\r\n\r\nwe   ask   for   clarification  and  we   ask   for\r\n\r\ninformation. Instead of discussing the  issue  with\r\n\r\nus  at  a  Party meeting under expert guidance  and\r\n\r\nunder wise leadership, we have been dubbed as\r\n\r\nanti-merger,  and  a sudden demand for an open  vote  of\r\n\r\nconfidence in the Government is made on us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we understand and we appreciate that merger\r\n\r\nis  not  palatable  to the Tunku and  his  Alliance\r\n\r\nGovernment and that we are in no position  to  make\r\n\r\nuncompromising  demands on the Federation.  But  we\r\n\r\nfeel strongly that in a negotiation of such import,\r\n\r\nthe   collective  leadership  must  have  the  full\r\n\r\nmandate of the Party and the people before  it  can\r\n\r\nproceed.  As socialists and Party members loyal  to\r\n\r\nParty  objectives, we must know the  minimum  terms\r\n\r\nand  conditions  and  the compromisable  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions before we can give our mandate.  Had  we\r\n\r\nnot accepted the Party analysis as laid down in the\r\n\r\nFourth  Anniversary Celebration Souvenir as to  why\r\n\r\nthe  Alliance in the Federation is anti-merger,  we\r\n\r\nwould  not  need  to  know  the  minimum  and   the\r\n\r\ncompromisable conditions before we gave our mandate\r\n\r\nto  the collective leadership. The sudden change of\r\n\r\nheart  by  the  Tunku in offering us  super  merger\r\n\r\nknocked  the  ground off our feet. We are  grateful\r\n\r\nfor  his  graciousness, for his  charity,  for  his\r\n\r\nmagnanimity, but we have a right to know  from  our\r\n\r\nown  leaders under what terms this merger or  super\r\n\r\nmerger  is to be brought about. Even if our minimum\r\n\r\nterms  and  conditions could not be  fulfilled,  we\r\n\r\nwould have the satisfaction of knowing that we have\r\n\r\nbeen   associated  in  fighting  for  our  glorious\r\n\r\npolitical goal. But nothing about the super  merger\r\n\r\nis told to us. Instead we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nasked to give blanket approval - which under ordinary\r\n\r\ncircumstances  I  have  no  hesitation  at  all  to\r\n\r\ngive - and a vote of confidence to the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, Mr Speaker, Sir, I plead\r\n\r\nwith the Prime Minister to withdraw this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nyou have heard the sad and the rather pathetic call\r\n\r\nof  the  Prime Minister, \"That this House expresses\r\n\r\nits confidence in the Government.\" Sad and pathetic\r\n\r\nbecause  it comes from a Government that still  has\r\n\r\n39  seats  in  the  Assembly and  is  faced  by  an\r\n\r\nOpposition of only 12, as has been ably put by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Nee Soon.

The\r\n\r\ngeneral public has now focused its attention on the\r\n\r\nintra-party struggle. Well, what is wrong with  the\r\n\r\nParty?  One  thing: it is the lack  of  intra-party\r\n\r\ndemocracy. Yes, it is the very lack of democracy we\r\n\r\nhear so much about in this House. This very lack of\r\n\r\nintra-party democracy that has brought about such a\r\n\r\nludicrously  chaotic situation  in  the  Government\r\n\r\ntoday. It sounds almost like a dream. Democracy - one\r\n\r\nof  the  chief tenets of the P.A.P.

I propose to give the House  the\r\n\r\nbackground  that  has led to this  motion.  In  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. democracy is the special  property  of  the\r\n\r\nvery  few, the heavenly-born, specially endowed,  a\r\n\r\ncoterie  of  very special and privileged people - the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership. The majority in the P.A.P.,  the\r\n\r\nrank  and  file,  the true workers in  the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthose  who do all the ground work, who move,  work,\r\n\r\nlive  and  eat among the masses; feeling the  pulse\r\n\r\nand temper of the masses - they have never known the\r\n\r\ntrue meaning of intra-party democracy. Do they take\r\n\r\npart  in  intra-party  discussion  and  intra-party\r\n\r\nconsultation  when major policies are  decided  on?\r\n\r\nWhen   decisions   are  taken  which   affect   the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  and destiny of the people of Singapore?\r\n\r\nAre  they  ever consulted? No, Sir, they are  never\r\n\r\nconsulted. And the Party set-up is such that  there\r\n\r\nis  nothing  they can do about it - hardly  anything.\r\n\r\nThe  Party leadership does not regard the rank  and\r\n\r\nfile as men and women with brains and intelligence.\r\n\r\nSuch  brains and intelligence the P.A.P. leadership\r\n\r\nbelieves  to  be  the  special prerogative  of  the\r\n\r\nleadership and is only found in the leadership. Any\r\n\r\ncriticism  is  smacked down as  unconstructive.  Is\r\n\r\ncriticism   unconstructive  when   one   asks   the\r\n\r\nleadership  not  to  be  arrogant  to  the  people?\r\n\r\nIndeed,  the  rank and file, all the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\nparty  are merely tools fit to be pushed around  by\r\n\r\nthe  leadership  for the glory of  the  leadership.\r\n\r\nTheir's  not to reason why. Their's but to  do  and\r\n\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret I have to bore the\r\n\r\nHouse  with all these unsavory facts.

The\r\n\r\npeople will be shocked and surprised to learn  that\r\n\r\nall  this  selection of cadres is  done  by  a  few\r\n\r\npersons,  and  if  your  views  are  known  to   be\r\n\r\ndifferent from the views of the leaders, well,  you\r\n\r\ncan whistle for your cadreship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Mr Speaker - there were 500 cadres. After what\r\n\r\nis  known  as  the  Ong Eng Guan incident  all  the\r\n\r\noriginal cadres were eliminated and new cadres were\r\n\r\nformed.  Until  a few months ago in  a  Party  that\r\n\r\nboasts  of a membership of five figures there  were\r\n\r\nonly 70 cadres- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Perhaps he can go on  to  a  different\r\n\r\naspect of his speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I bow to your decision, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir.  Anyway, you can see how  every  new\r\n\r\nsituation inside the Party has given birth to a new\r\n\r\nset  of  cadres.  Nobody really knows  outside  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership  who the cadres  are.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nclosely guarded secret, because disclosure of  this\r\n\r\ncadres  list  will bring in a lot  of  embarrassing\r\n\r\nquestions  which cannot be answered satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, Mr Speaker, a good number of old\r\n\r\nparty  faithfuls have not been confirmed as  cadres\r\n\r\nbecause they are known to hold views different from\r\n\r\nthose  of the leadership. And these are the  people\r\n\r\nwho  have sacrificed so much to help the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\npower.  Their  only sin seems to be that  they  are\r\n\r\npeople  of  conviction, not so easily malleable  to\r\n\r\nthe   whims  and  fancies  of  the  leadership  and\r\n\r\nunwilling to be sycophants. I ask you, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nis  this democracy? Is this democracy? Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  from what I have just said, it is clear  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  such thing as democracy  inside  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  It  is  this lack of intra-party  democracy\r\n\r\nthat has brought the P.A.P. to its present state of\r\n\r\ninstability and caused a so-called crisis in  spite\r\n\r\nof  the  Government majority in the  Assembly.  The\r\n\r\nleadership has made a complete mockery of democracy\r\n\r\ninside the Party. There is complete dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nand  frustration amongst the rank and  file.  Party\r\n\r\nmembers have lost confidence in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  present  Party leadership.  The  leaders  have\r\n\r\ntheir  noses in the clouds and their feet  off  the\r\n\r\nground,  and  already stand utterly discredited  in\r\n\r\nthe eyes of the majority in the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such then, Sir, is the reason why we have the\r\n\r\nmotion  of confidence tabled by the Hon. the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister before the House today. It is not the lack\r\n\r\nin  numbers amongst the Government benches that  is\r\n\r\ncausing this anxiety, uncertainty, instability  and\r\n\r\nlack of confidence. It is the Party leadership that\r\n\r\nis  denied  this confidence. That, Mr Speaker,  is\r\n\r\nthe  secret of the motion. That is why we have this\r\n\r\nabsurd  comic opera of a Government with  39  seats\r\n\r\nout of 51 asking for a vote of confidence. Sir, you\r\n\r\nsaw the strength of the P.A.P. giant two years ago.\r\n\r\nToday,  you see the weakness in this strength.  The\r\n\r\nweak link, the chink in the armour, is this lack of\r\n\r\nintra-party democracy. It is really ridiculous that\r\n\r\nan intra-party struggle between two factions should\r\n\r\nhave  been brought into: this Assembly.  It  is  an\r\n\r\nintra-party struggle between the leadership and the\r\n\r\nrank  and  file. From a purely intra-party struggle\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. leadership has, by various twists, turns\r\n\r\nand  somersaults, magnified it into a  much  bigger\r\n\r\nissue. It has become a special crisis that has been\r\n\r\nbrought  before the House. Of course, this is  done\r\n\r\nwith  a very special object in view. They now stage\r\n\r\nthis  comic opera, this super comic opera, I think,\r\n\r\nin  order  that  they  may  bring  the  intra-party\r\n\r\nstruggle  into  the Assembly so as to  confuse  the\r\n\r\npeople.  It is really tragic and pathetic that  our\r\n\r\nleadership have so lost their grip on the Party and\r\n\r\non  the  affairs of the State that  they  have  now\r\n\r\nbecome  totally bankrupt of political  ideas.  When\r\n\r\npoliticians  have  to  resort  to  smearing   their\r\n\r\nopponents in the hope of salvaging their own\r\n\r\nfast-sinking  prestige,  then surely  it  is  time  they\r\n\r\nstepped  down from the political stage and  took  a\r\n\r\nlong,  long holiday. Such smears are not  something\r\n\r\nnew. The Lim Yew Hock Government- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Thank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - used these same tactics\r\n\r\nagainst the P.A.P. There were the same bogeymen  of\r\n\r\nthe extremist and the Communist. Now we have it all\r\n\r\nover  again. We have anticipated such smear tactics\r\n\r\nas  was  said in our letter to the Chairman of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  It  has become fashionable for the  present\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership to smear all who  disagree  with\r\n\r\nthem as stooges, or as being under the influence of\r\n\r\nthis  person  or  that person. More  recently,  the\r\n\r\nsmear  has  taken the extremely dangerous  turn  of\r\n\r\nlabelling   all  who  disagree  with   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  as non-Malayan, communal or  even\r\n\r\npro-Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us trace the smear campaign through the\r\n\r\nhistory  of  the  P.A.P. When the Party  was  first\r\n\r\nformed in 1954 all those in the P.A.P. were staunch\r\n\r\nanti-colonialists. In 1957, the P.A.P. was  divided\r\n\r\ninto  two  groups - the non-Communists and  the\r\n\r\npro-Communists.   In  1959,  there  were   the   social\r\n\r\ndemocrats   against   the  Left-wing   adventurers,\r\n\r\nfireside  revolutionaries and extremists.  Now,  in\r\n\r\n1961,  only  a  few weeks back, it is the  national\r\n\r\nLeft  against the non-national Left and parish-pump\r\n\r\npatriots.  Today,  it  is  the  non-Communist  Left\r\n\r\nagainst  the Communist Left; and right now,  today,\r\n\r\nin  this Assembly hall, it is the P.A.P. leadership\r\n\r\nagainst  the duped, the confused and the  gullible.\r\n\r\nIt  is highly interesting and revealing to a lot of\r\n\r\npeople  in  Singapore. But finally let us  ask  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership: what is Left and who is Left? Is\r\n\r\nit  the P.A.P. leadership which is Left, or  is  it\r\n\r\nLee Kuan Yew who is Left? There is a lot of talk of\r\n\r\nmerger and anti-merger. Who is anti-merger? We  are\r\n\r\nall  for  merger. But the confederation  is  surely\r\n\r\nsomething new and different. Is it wrong to ask for\r\n\r\ndetails  before we give our support? Why  must  our\r\n\r\nleadership give full and unqualified support to the\r\n\r\nconfederation  scheme before  even  consulting  the\r\n\r\nParty?  Is this not clear evidence of the  lack  of\r\n\r\nconsultation  and  lack  of intra-party  democracy?\r\n\r\nCannot  the leadership see that it is this lack  of\r\n\r\nintra-party    democracy    that     has     caused\r\n\r\ndisillusionment, frustration and non-confidence  in\r\n\r\nthe leadership, and hence this motion today? It  is\r\n\r\nreally farcical, Sir, that some politicians have so\r\n\r\ndegenerated that they have to concoct stories to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrighten the people. In so doing, they hope to  win\r\n\r\ntheir support. Politicians with the experience, the\r\n\r\ncalibre   and  undoubted  ability  of  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  should be the last to  resort  to  such\r\n\r\nmeans  of  finding support for their fast tottering\r\n\r\nempire.  With  all  the years of experience  behind\r\n\r\nthem, surely they know that the only firm support a\r\n\r\npolitician gets is the solid support of the people.\r\n\r\nYou  do not get the solid support of the people  by\r\n\r\nfrightening them with ghosts, spectres and  bogeys.\r\n\r\nYou  get their solid support only by genuinely  and\r\n\r\nconstantly  looking after their  interests  and  by\r\n\r\ngiving  expression to their needs and  aspirations.\r\n\r\nInside  the Party you can achieve unity only  by  a\r\n\r\ngenuine   and   constant  practice  of  intra-party\r\n\r\ndemocracy. In our case today, that can be  done  by\r\n\r\nthe  calling of a 51 Branch Executives and  Central\r\n\r\nExecutives  meeting to discuss Party  policies  and\r\n\r\ndecisions.  Let the P.A.P. leadership  prove  their\r\n\r\ngenuine  love  of democracy which they  pretend  to\r\n\r\ndefend  by  calling  this  51-branch  meeting   and\r\n\r\naccepting  the decision of this 51-branch  meeting.\r\n\r\nInstead  of  trying to find support and  confidence\r\n\r\ninside  the Party, the leadership have now come  to\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  to beg for this same support.  Whose\r\n\r\nsupport do they expect to get? The support  of  the\r\n\r\npro-colonialists? The support of  the  Members  for\r\n\r\nTanglin, Cairnhill, Mountbatten, Farrer Park?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me emphasise once again that this\r\n\r\nconfidence vote should be sought not in this  House\r\n\r\nbut  inside the Party. The Government is not  short\r\n\r\nof  Assemblymen to form a majority in the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. leadership do not need the confidence of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly, but they need, and need it very badly\r\n\r\ntoo, the confidence of the Party which alas they do\r\n\r\nnot command. A confidence vote in the Assembly will\r\n\r\nnot  make  the P.A.P. any the stronger. The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncan  only  be  strong  if the leadership  have  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of the rank and file and if they  pursue\r\n\r\na  correct  policy. The motion therefore should  be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn. The confidence vote should be sought  in\r\n\r\nthe  51-branch meeting inside the Party. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership have hoped to bamboozle and confuse  the\r\n\r\npeople  with  red  herrings. The  motion  today  is\r\n\r\nmerely a subterfuge to diddle support for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership from outside forces. I ask  these\r\n\r\nmen  of  ability, intelligence and guts not to  run\r\n\r\naway  from their own Party, but to go back and face\r\n\r\ntheir  own  comrades.  This  attempt  to  use   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to solve an intra-party crisis will  not\r\n\r\nhelp  matters. The few leaders who do not have  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the majority in the Party are  holding\r\n\r\non, monopolising and almost appropriating the Party\r\n\r\napparatus as their own private possession.  If  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership want a confidence vote, let  them\r\n\r\nseek  it at the 51 branch meeting inside the Party.\r\n\r\nThe motion has no place in this Assembly.

But it does transpire, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  essence of this emergency is that the Hon. the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  desires to continue  to  hold  the\r\n\r\noffice of Prime Minister, and his colleagues desire\r\n\r\nto continue sitting in their padded scarlet leather\r\n\r\narm-chairs. If I might borrow an adjective  of  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member who spoke last, I would indeed  agree,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  this  is a pathetic  motion.  Does  the\r\n\r\nGovernment really seek from this Assembly a vote of\r\n\r\nconfidence? Is that its purpose? The Hon. the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has informed you, Sir, that he seeks  from\r\n\r\nthis  House a mandate to govern. He has sought this\r\n\r\nfrom  the people of Singapore in Hong Lim  and  in\r\n\r\nAnson,  and he has been rejected. How does he  seek\r\n\r\nfrom  this  Assembly  at this stage  a  mandate  to\r\n\r\ngovern?  I hope to show you, Mr Speaker, that,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  that  is not the purpose of this motion.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  they  have put a vote of confidence  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore and that vote  of  confidence\r\n\r\nthey  have lost; and nothing they can do here, with\r\n\r\na  majority obtained two years ago when the  people\r\n\r\nhad  faith in the P.A.P. leadership, can obliterate\r\n\r\nthe  mass  of  evidence of disillusionment  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore with the  leadership  of  the\r\n\r\nruling  Party, which is the Government  today.  You\r\n\r\nmust be aware, Mr Speaker, it is your duty to take\r\n\r\ncognizance of the fact, that three months ago there\r\n\r\nwas  a  by-election in Hong Lim and that the ruling\r\n\r\nParty,  should you read the newspapers, Sir, fought\r\n\r\nthat  by-election  with  all  the  forces  at   its\r\n\r\ncommand.  In fact, two days before the end  of  the\r\n\r\ngruelling  seven  weeks,  the  Prime  Minister   is\r\n\r\nreported  to have informed the voters of  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. would treat the by-election  as  a\r\n\r\nvote of confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read, Sir, an excerpt of a report of a speech\r\n\r\nalleged to have been made by the Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nprinted in the Straits Times of the 28th of  April,\r\n\r\nthe day before Polling Day.

That  vote  of\r\n\r\nconfidence  was unquestionably lost. I  know,  Sir,\r\n\r\nyou  have  this afternoon heard the  story  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  lion  and the Communist bear,  this  fairy\r\n\r\ntale  for  the  consumption of little  children  to\r\n\r\nprove  to  them that the defeats in  Hong  Lim  and\r\n\r\nAnson  did not indicate the disenchantment  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore with the P.A.P. leadership. Oh,\r\n\r\nno, it came about by the Machiavellian machinations\r\n\r\nof  the British lion who sought - the richest of  all\r\n\r\nfairy  tales - to encourage the Communists to form  a\r\n\r\ngovernment. It has not been said, Sir, but  I  will\r\n\r\nbe  interested to know from later speakers, whether\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim and myself are deemed  now\r\n\r\nto be the standard-bearers of the Communist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are conscious, Sir, that immediately after the\r\n\r\nmassive  defeat in Hong Lim - and you  have  been  so\r\n\r\ninformed  quite frankly by the Prime Minister  that\r\n\r\nit  was  considered a grave defeat - serious  thought\r\n\r\nwas  given to the resignation of the Party.  I  may\r\n\r\nwell be misinformed, but my information is that the\r\n\r\nParty  considered the defeat was the defeat of  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister alone, not of the Party,  and  they\r\n\r\ndecided  to continue. The Prime Minister  issued  a\r\n\r\nstatement  that  the  Party  would  reconsider  the\r\n\r\nposition after the Anson by-election. Sir,  let  me\r\n\r\nmake  this clear. In the Anson by-election, Merdeka\r\n\r\nwas the issue, not the slogan, Sir, but the concept\r\n\r\nof  independence for the people of  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\ncontinuance of the Prime Minister as Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwas  an  issue,  but  I never sought  to  make  the\r\n\r\ncontinuance of the Government an issue.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  would  not  have it  so,  and  he  sought\r\n\r\nconsistently   and  repeatedly - and   so   did   the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. - to  make it known to the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nthat  they would treat the vote in Anson as a  vote\r\n\r\nof confidence. May I, Sir, with your permission, in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  this challenge of the  P.A.P. to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, read only some  very  recent\r\n\r\nstatements  made by them? You were  referred  to  a\r\n\r\nforum organised by the University Socialist Club. I\r\n\r\nwas  one of those who were invited to speak. I must\r\n\r\nconfess, Sir, that I was not conscious that it  was\r\n\r\nLord  Selkirk  who  had  persuaded  the  University\r\n\r\nSocialist  Club to hold that meeting  in  order  to\r\n\r\nbring  about  the  downfall of  the  P.A.P. and  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  of the Communists. I am very interested\r\n\r\nto  learn  that.  But what is interesting  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  I trust, Sir, is that this stalwart of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to  whom  the  Prime Minister  has  already\r\n\r\nreferred,  a  man by the name of C. V. Devan  Nair,\r\n\r\nstated  at  this  forum, \"P.A.P. will  not  stay  a\r\n\r\npunching bag\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Sir, this\r\n\r\ndiabolic  English Press, the Straits  Times,  under\r\n\r\ndate  12th  July,  1961, which  I  intend  to  make\r\n\r\navailable  to  the House, reports with considerable\r\n\r\nprominence  the  speaker for  the  P.A.P. at  this\r\n\r\nfunction - the  representative  of  the  P.A.P.,  the\r\n\r\neditor  of Petir, its official organ. And  this  is\r\n\r\nwhat it reports him as having said - and being there,\r\n\r\nSir, I can confirm it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He [that is, Mr Devan Nair] found it incredible\r\n\r\nthat some people who claimed close association with\r\n\r\nthe  party should attack it and say that everything\r\n\r\nthe party did was wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the party said they wanted to give the\r\n\r\nmandate  back  to the people, they were  told  they\r\n\r\nmust not resign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In other words,\" Mr Nair said, \"we should remain\r\n\r\nas  a useful punching bag for other people. We  are\r\n\r\nnot going to remain a punching bag for anyone.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, in other words, Mr Nair is telling the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, \"We don't like criticism.  We  won't\r\n\r\naccept  criticism. If in the Anson by-election  the\r\n\r\nelectorate  votes  against  the  P.A.P.,  we   will\r\n\r\nconsider that a criticism which is unacceptable and\r\n\r\nwe  will  resign  because  we  will  not  remain  a\r\n\r\npunching  bag.\"  The  first  public  expression  of\r\n\r\ndictatorial   arrogance   on   which    the    hon.\r\n\r\nBackbenchers  have  thrown such considerable  light\r\n\r\ntoday.  It was thought, Sir, by this Party  in  its\r\n\r\nsmug  complacency  of  its  majority  that  it  was\r\n\r\nindispensable and that it threw down the challenge,\r\n\r\nthe  threat of a drunken gambler, to the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  \"You  vote  against  us,  and  we  will\r\n\r\nresign.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, on 13th July we have the organ of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. coming out in an editorial again making  the\r\n\r\nissue of the Anson by-election a vote of confidence\r\n\r\nin  the Government. I can place this one, Sir - it is\r\n\r\nunmutilated. It is known as Petir, the organ of the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party, Thursday, 13th July,  1961,\r\n\r\ntwo  days before this so-called crucial by-election\r\n\r\nin which the P.A.P. leadership\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsciously  and  intentionally - whether   with   or\r\n\r\nwithout  the support of their rank and file,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know - made the issue one of confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Democracy on Trial - what some people find\r\n\r\ninexplicable   [says  this  paper]   is   why   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  with 39 seats in the assembly,  should\r\n\r\ndevote  so  much  time  and trouble  in  trying  to\r\n\r\nrecover one seat in Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...the P.A.P.'s approach to democracy is based on\r\n\r\nthe   belief  that  an  effective  government  must\r\n\r\nclearly have moral authority to rule.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I say bravo!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The fact that at any particular moment a\r\n\r\nGovernment  has a majority in the Assembly  is  not\r\n\r\nconclusive  proof  that it enjoys moral  authority.\r\n\r\nAll  that  it  proves is that at the  time  it  was\r\n\r\nelected, it had the backing of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the course of its life, a Government\r\n\r\nmay,  for  a  variety of reasons,  forfeit  popular\r\n\r\nsupport. The Government may have got in under false\r\n\r\npretences. It may have become effete, tyrannical or\r\n\r\ncorrupt.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Let   me   say  this,  Sir,  I  am  not  suggesting\r\n\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Or it may be that the people may have changed\r\n\r\ntheir minds about the very policies they endorsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the reasons, a democratic Government,\r\n\r\nwhether  good  or  bad, which has  lost  its  moral\r\n\r\nauthority  to  rule,  cannot in  the  long  run  be\r\n\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Anson by-election, what is being put to the\r\n\r\ntest  is  whether, as the Opposition groups  claim,\r\n\r\nthe Government has lost this moral authority.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That was, if I may say so, Sir, an honest piece  of\r\n\r\njournalism  and  an honest stand. It  said  to  the\r\n\r\npeople, \"We were elected two years ago but much has\r\n\r\nhappened since then. You may not want us today.  We\r\n\r\nmay  have  become  tyrannical. We may  have  become\r\n\r\neffete. We will treat this Anson by-election  as  a\r\n\r\nvote of confidence.\" A very honest stand indeed. It\r\n\r\nis  clear,  therefore, that the  P.A.P. recognised\r\n\r\nthat  the mandate it received in 1959 was no longer\r\n\r\nvalid,  and it sought in Anson to ascertain whether\r\n\r\nit  had,  in  its  own  words,  \"forfeited  popular\r\n\r\nsupport\", whether the people believed it  had  come\r\n\r\nin    under   false   pretences - I   repeat   \"false\r\n\r\npretences\" - and whether in the view of the people it\r\n\r\nwas  no longer a Party that they trusted. Now  this\r\n\r\neditorial   clearly  indicates  that   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nrecognised that the majority it had in the Assembly\r\n\r\nas  a  result of the votes of the people two  years\r\n\r\nago does\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily reflect the feelings of the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore, that it was no use coming here for  a\r\n\r\nmandate,  that  a  mandate  was  needed  from   the\r\n\r\npeople - and not, as the last speaker said, a mandate\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Party. The Party is not the  people.  It\r\n\r\nsought - and quite rightly - a mandate from the people\r\n\r\nbecause it recognised that in the interim period it\r\n\r\nmight have lost that confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us recognise, Sir, that this vote of\r\n\r\nconfidence was sought in a P.A.P. stronghold. Anson\r\n\r\nin  1959  was  won  by a P.A.P. candidate  with  a\r\n\r\nsmashing  majority  over,  I  believe,  four  other\r\n\r\ncandidates.  And what is particularly  interesting,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, is the way Anson was built up  by\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. as being the quintessence, the sample of\r\n\r\nall  Singapore. They were prepared to take the vote\r\n\r\nin Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only two more paragraphs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Anson is in many respects a good testing ground.\r\n\r\nIt   is   a   Singapore  in  miniature  as  regards\r\n\r\ndistribution of population in terms of  communities\r\n\r\nand  social classes. Unlike Hong Lim, where special\r\n\r\nand   purely  local  factors  may  have  influenced\r\n\r\ndecisions, in Anson, it is a straight-forward fight\r\n\r\nbetween   the  P.A.P. on  the  one  hand   and   a\r\n\r\nheterogeneous collection of political  parties  who\r\n\r\nbetween them are espousing all the causes that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has refused to take up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a test of whether a constituency which is\r\n\r\ntypical  of  Singapore as a whole  is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nendorse  the  policies and actions  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment during its two years in office.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  in  case  you say that that could  have  been\r\n\r\nhardly   noticed  by  anybody  as  being  a   Party\r\n\r\nnewspaper,  let  me  assure you that  the  diabolic\r\n\r\nEnglish  Press - and  I  have  no  doubt  the  honest\r\n\r\nChinese,  Malay and Tamil Press too - gave  it  full\r\n\r\npublicity - \"ANSON: A TEST FOR P.A.P.\". I read  from\r\n\r\nthe Straits Times of Friday, the day before the\r\n\r\nby-election - \"By-election will decide if it  still  has\r\n\r\n`moral  right  to stay in power'\" and  considerable\r\n\r\nexcerpts from this paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will see, Mr Speaker, Sir, that they\r\n\r\nintentionally   sought  in  these   two   areas - and\r\n\r\nparticularly in Anson - a vote of confidence  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. They lost this vote. The Hon. the Prime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister refers to gamblers. There are gamblers who\r\n\r\nrefuse  to  pay  up on their debt  of  honour.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership refuses to meet the promises that\r\n\r\nit  has  so clearly made to the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nin  the by-elections of Hong Lim and of Anson.  You\r\n\r\nare  told,  Sir  - I  am not surprised;  it  is  now\r\n\r\ntraditional - that the victory of the  Workers  Party\r\n\r\nin   Anson   is  suggested  to  be   due   to   the\r\n\r\nMachiavellian machinations of Lord Selkirk. That of\r\n\r\nall  things is perhaps the most amusing. But  there\r\n\r\nare  other allegations. We did not win it, Sir, not\r\n\r\nat all. They did not lose it, Sir, not a bit of it.\r\n\r\nThey  did not lose it and consequently they do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to pay up their debts. They remind me of  the\r\n\r\ngambler  who goes to a firm of solicitors and  asks\r\n\r\nthem to protect him from his gambling debts through\r\n\r\nlegal technicalities. Sir, they refuse to pay up on\r\n\r\ntheir  promises and their threat to the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. And they come to this Assembly with this\r\n\r\nfairy  tale  of the lion and the bear in  order  to\r\n\r\ncontinue in office for another two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they were quite convinced of victory, because\r\n\r\nthere  are  no  millionaires  in  Anson.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nparticularly  poor Division. I doubt  if  there  is\r\n\r\nanother  Division in Singapore which is poorer.  It\r\n\r\nis a particular stronghold of the P.A.P. Also there\r\n\r\nwere 1,500 new voters about whom some nasty rumours\r\n\r\nare  spreading around.

Then,\r\n\r\nSir,  the editorial of this diabolic English Press.\r\n\r\nI  read  now, Sir, from July 15th (the day  of  the\r\n\r\nelection)  Straits  Times, Saturday.  The  heading,\r\n\r\nacross  the  front page, \"ALL AT STAKE  NOW\".  \"Lee\r\n\r\n[that  is,  our Prime Minister, Mr Speaker,  Sir]:\r\n\r\nThis decides whether State goes off rails\". And  in\r\n\r\nthe  editorial  itself,  we  have  details  of  the\r\n\r\nhorrors  of  what  would happen if  the  Anson \r\n\r\nby-election were lost by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, I have sufficiently proved to you\r\n\r\nand sufficiently reminded the Members opposite that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. leadership consciously,  intentionally\r\n\r\nand repeatedly made the Anson by-election a vote of\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the Government, and as  clearly  as\r\n\r\npossible  threatened the people of  Singapore  with\r\n\r\nresignation  if  it lost. It has lost.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nlost the Anson by-election, its own stronghold, and\r\n\r\nthis  Party, which calls itself a consistent Party,\r\n\r\nrefused to accept the very vote that it has sought.\r\n\r\nIt  refuses to accept because that would  mean  the\r\n\r\nresignation  of the Government. It is  not  a  test\r\n\r\nwhich the Opposition laid down, Mr Speaker. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  a test which I sought to lay down. I made  the\r\n\r\nissue of the continuance of the Prime Minister  one\r\n\r\nof  the  planks of my platform. It is a test  which\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister, not wishing to go alone, sought\r\n\r\nto  drag  the entire P.A.P., the entire Government.\r\n\r\nAnd  he has lost. Does he resign? He is, I say with\r\n\r\nrespect,   in   honour  bound  to  resign,   though\r\n\r\nnaturally nothing in the law can prevent  him  from\r\n\r\nnot resigning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to your knowledge, we had the example not\r\n\r\nvery  long ago of another government which  refused\r\n\r\nto  resign.  It came to be known as the Jaga  Kreta\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Some  Members  may  remember  it.   It\r\n\r\nstarted  off somewhere in June 1956 with a  promise\r\n\r\nby the Prime Minister that his was only a caretaker\r\n\r\ngovernment  and that he would resign within  a  few\r\n\r\nmonths, in a short while.

And  the  Chief   Minister\r\n\r\ncontinued  in office, and continued in office,  and\r\n\r\ncontinued  in office, right up to the bitter  legal\r\n\r\nend.  He had the legal power. So, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nhave  these  gentlemen  opposite  the  legal  power\r\n\r\nconstitutionally despite the will  of  the  people,\r\n\r\ndespite their promises, to continue in office.

Sir, with\r\n\r\nrespect, I find that the bogey or the fairy tale or\r\n\r\nthe  ghost  story of the Earl of Selkirk persuading\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  of  Singapore to  take  office  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that is unworthy of further  comment.  I\r\n\r\nmyself have had the pleasure of being the guest  of\r\n\r\nthe  Earl of Selkirk and I can solemnly assure you,\r\n\r\nSir, that at no time did he seek to persuade me  to\r\n\r\njoin the Communist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other bogey that we now have is that the\r\n\r\ncentral  issue before the people is  merger  or  no\r\n\r\nmerger. Sir, the P.A.P. tell us that they genuinely\r\n\r\nseek  merger with the Federation of Malaya. I would\r\n\r\nask  you  to recognise, Mr Speaker, that today  in\r\n\r\nthis  very  House the Hon. the Prime Minister  laid\r\n\r\ndown  impossible conditions for the achievement  of\r\n\r\nthat merger. He said the P.A.P. seeks the merger of\r\n\r\nSingapore  with  the Federation  on  conditions  of\r\n\r\nautonomy in education and labour policies. Sir, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister himself is a lawyer and I do credit\r\n\r\nhim  with  an understanding of the Constitution  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya. He must be conscious that\r\n\r\nthough  the  Federation of Malaya  permits  of  the\r\n\r\nincorporation  of new States as constituent  States\r\n\r\nwithin the Federation, they would all be subject to\r\n\r\nthe  same  laws,  and  it is impossible  under  the\r\n\r\npresent   Constitution  of   the   Federation   for\r\n\r\nSingapore or any other State to have the privileged\r\n\r\nposition   of  autonomy  in  labour  and  education\r\n\r\nlegislation. If it is meant seriously, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, as we must believe that it was meant, then  it\r\n\r\nmust  be  suggested that we will compel or seek  to\r\n\r\nobtain  from  the  Federation an amendment  to  the\r\n\r\nConstitution of the Federation, an amendment  which\r\n\r\nwould   require  a  two-thirds  majority   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation Parliament, an amendment which would put\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a State superior to any  other  State\r\n\r\nthat  is a constituent member of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are all too conscious that for many years now the Government of Singapore has\r\n\r\nofficially  offered to the Federation merger  as  a\r\n\r\nconstituent State unconditionally. I have disclosed\r\n\r\nthat  I  made  that offer in 1955. I  know  it  was\r\n\r\nrepeated again and again, Mr Speaker, up to  about\r\n\r\nthe  middle of or early 1956. I have no doubt,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that it has been repeated since then.\r\n\r\nWe  have each been rebuffed, sometimes courteously,\r\n\r\nand  sometimes even sharply, on the offer to  merge\r\n\r\nas  a State unconditionally. Yet it is suggested by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister that Singapore  can  and  will\r\n\r\nachieve  merger with the Federation in  1963,  with\r\n\r\nautonomy in education and labour legislation. I say\r\n\r\nto  you,  Sir, that that is a day-dream which  they\r\n\r\nknow  to be a day-dream. I do not know whether they\r\n\r\nexpect  the people to take it seriously,  but  they\r\n\r\nthemselves cannot believe in it seriously. We  have\r\n\r\nthe  hard  reality that for six years now  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  refused  any  kind  of  opening  of  official\r\n\r\nconversations for a merger. For the last two  years\r\n\r\nthey  have even refused a Common Market.  In  those\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  Sir, I say that it  is  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  that  is  making impossible  conditions\r\n\r\nleading to the impossibility of merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is alleged that\r\n\r\nthe  issue  in Anson was merger or no merger,  that\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C. Six came out openly against merger, and\r\n\r\nthat  I received their support. I think I ought  to\r\n\r\nmake  it  clear, Sir. The Workers Party at no  time\r\n\r\nsought  the  support of the T.U.C. Six  or  anybody\r\n\r\nelse except the voters of Anson. We do not know who\r\n\r\nvoted  for us, quite naturally. But it is a curious\r\n\r\nthing  to suggest that the T.U.C. Six and the three\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretaries  came  out  openly   against\r\n\r\nmerger and yet they would support me because,  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am  on  record prior to Election Day  as  having\r\n\r\nstated quite categorically that I have at all times\r\n\r\nbeen  and am in favour of merger. I do not  believe\r\n\r\nin  seeking for Singapore an unhealthy superiority.\r\n\r\nWe  can and must go in only as a constituent  State\r\n\r\nunconditionally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important, Mr Speaker, that we\r\n\r\nshould  take cognizance of the letter of  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nwhich  was  published in the Press yesterday.

Mr Speaker, Sir, let us face it. It is\r\n\r\nperfectly  true  that  in  this  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  which  was brought back by  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, there are executive powers, powers\r\n\r\nwhich  were  never  sought of me  in  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council  which  was  envisaged  the  year\r\n\r\nearlier. By some curious coincidence, the Hon. the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, in partnership with the  gentleman\r\n\r\nfrom  Cairnhill, brought back a Constitution  which\r\n\r\ngave  considerable executive powers to the Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council. But these powers do not  prevent\r\n\r\nthe  Government  from  issuing  an  order  for  the\r\n\r\nrelease of the detainees. They do give the Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council the power to issue an order to His\r\n\r\nExcellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara who will then\r\n\r\nbe  required  to put them back again. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, if that should happen, we would know where the\r\n\r\nfault lies. It is not necessary that the Government\r\n\r\nmust then resign. The Government should resign when\r\n\r\nit  loses  the moral support and the confidence  of\r\n\r\nthe  people. I can understand no reason  whatsoever\r\n\r\nfor the Government to resign when, in pursuance  of\r\n\r\nthe people's will, it takes steps which are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nslapped  back  by  the superior  force  of  British\r\n\r\nimperialism. But at no time are we aware,  nor  has\r\n\r\nit ever been suggested, that this Government sought\r\n\r\nto  do  more  than  present a petty  paper  to  the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council, and it has left it there\r\n\r\nfor  two  whole years, Sir, I find it difficult  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the British Government would  seek  a\r\n\r\nconstitutional crisis in respect of  the  continued\r\n\r\ndetention  of  these people who have  already  been\r\n\r\nfive  years  or  four  years  in  detention.  Their\r\n\r\nutility,  Sir,  to any subversive organisation  has\r\n\r\nbeen completely nullified. Now that the matter  has\r\n\r\ncome out into the open, no doubt we may hope to see\r\n\r\nsome  action.  But can the Government really  blame\r\n\r\nthe  trade union leaders for demanding the  release\r\n\r\nof  these  detainees? These persons  who,  together\r\n\r\nwith    Lim   Ching   Siong   and   others,    were\r\n\r\nprovidentially detained by an act of the  gentleman\r\n\r\nfrom Cairnhill at a time when it was-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would rather the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  refer  to the \"gentleman from Cairnhill\"  as\r\n\r\nthe Member for Cairnhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am so sorry, Sir. The Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill - it  is  a  word I  myself  consider  more\r\n\r\nappropriate.  The honourable Member  for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\ndetained  Lim Ching Siong and his colleagues  at  a\r\n\r\ntime  which was providential for the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  his group, as saving them from the competition\r\n\r\nof  their Party rivals. A curious coincidence,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  one which has not been lost on the  Party\r\n\r\nand which has not been lost on the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else did the T.U.C. Six and the three\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretaries demand?  They  demanded  the\r\n\r\nabolition of the Internal Security Council Is  that\r\n\r\nsomething  to take umbrage at? Are we  to  have  it\r\n\r\nopenly  stated  that  it is the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil which shores up this Government? That it is\r\n\r\nthe  Internal  Security Council which protects  the\r\n\r\ncontinued existence of this Government? Sir, at  no\r\n\r\ntime  and  nowhere  can I read that  any  of  these\r\n\r\npeople, who are not here to defend themselves, have\r\n\r\never  suggested  that they did not want  merger  or\r\n\r\nthat they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwanted  the  abolition  of  the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil in place of merger. What they have said is,\r\n\r\n\"Let  us have this. It is in our power now.\" Merger\r\n\r\nis  not in our power any more than marriage  is  in\r\n\r\nthe  power of one party. We have to get the consent\r\n\r\nof  the  other party. We cannot drag the Federation\r\n\r\nby its hair to the altar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in so far as words have meaning, I say to you\r\n\r\nthat in so far as a human being can judge from  the\r\n\r\nfacts,  it  has  been proved that  it  is  a  grave\r\n\r\nfalsehood to charge any group of persons  named  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  this  afternoon  with  being \r\n\r\nanti-merger.   The  three  Political  Secretaries   were\r\n\r\ncharged  by  the  Prime Minister as  having  openly\r\n\r\nopposed  the Government's policy of merger.  I  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister to prove that  statement.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  there  are,  however,  matters  of   even\r\n\r\ngreater import in this letter of which I feel  this\r\n\r\nHouse must take note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`You and I are aware that this is but the opening\r\n\r\nof a new test of strength between the non-Communist\r\n\r\nLeft and the Communist Left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also aware that having lost Anson we now\r\n\r\nface  trials and tribulations as those  who  reject\r\n\r\nmerger  mount their campaign against the government\r\n\r\nin  order  to  prevent it from  ever  reaching  any\r\n\r\nagreement   on   principle  with   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bogey of those who do not want merger and\r\n\r\nseek to prevent us from obtaining merger, which  we\r\n\r\ncannot   get  anyway  from  the  Federation   which\r\n\r\nconsistently refuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... let me assure you that it is not my desire to\r\n\r\nabsolve myself from the many unpleasant and awkward\r\n\r\nthings  that  the government will  have  to  do  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  the  people in order  to  maintain  the\r\n\r\neconomy  of  the  island,  the  livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, and the peace and order of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is most likely that mounting industrial action\r\n\r\nwill  be  taken  by  Mr Lim  Chin  Siong  and  his\r\n\r\nconfederates to coerce the party and the government\r\n\r\nto abandon its plan for merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that an open break has come, it is most likely\r\n\r\nthat  there  will  be a mounting offensive  on  the\r\n\r\ntrade union front with political and not industrial\r\n\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first political objective, of course, is to\r\n\r\nbreak up any talk of merger with the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it must be obvious that the\r\n\r\nallegation  of the threat of industrial  unrest  in\r\n\r\nthe  context of the smear campaign of the Communist\r\n\r\nLeft   necessarily  presages   the   use   of   the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Ordinance again  to\r\n\r\ndetain political opponents, whom providence is  not\r\n\r\ncommitting other Parties to detain, for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  the  leadership of the P.A.P. There is  no  one\r\n\r\nhere to pick their chestnuts out of the fire unless\r\n\r\nthey can persuade the British to do it through  the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I read with interest - I must confess with more than interest; with consternation and\r\n\r\nwith  surprise -  the statement in  this  memorandum\r\n\r\ntabled  by  the Deputy Premier today  that  of  the\r\n\r\neight  men  released, the most important  from  the\r\n\r\nsecurity point of view is Mr Lim Ching Siong,  for\r\n\r\nhe was the person \"built up as an open front leader\r\n\r\nby  the M.C.P. in 1955 and 1956\". And later on,  of\r\n\r\nthe  eight  people released, \"the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nhas  reason to believe that five, not including Lim\r\n\r\nChin  Siong,  genuinely and sincerely subscribe  to\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. democratic  socialist  ideology\".  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  whilst  incidentally  wondering  at   the\r\n\r\nextraordinary inconsistency of the conduct  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in making the so-called known front  man\r\n\r\nof   the   Malayan  Communist  Party  a   Political\r\n\r\nSecretary, I would ask you to notice that all these\r\n\r\nsymptoms augur the utilisation in massive form,  in\r\n\r\ntime  of  peace,  for political  purposes  and  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of  political power of  a  clique,  of\r\n\r\nprovisions intended to be used in time of emergency\r\n\r\nfor  the security of the people as a whole. Nor can\r\n\r\nwe,  Mr Speaker, ignore that remark about Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing   Siong   mounting  industrial   unrest   for\r\n\r\npolitical purposes. We are none of us so young that\r\n\r\nwe  can  have forgotten the unhappy events  of  the\r\n\r\nlatter  part  of  1956  with the  grave  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest  which  many people believed  to  have  been\r\n\r\ninspired by the government of the day for political\r\n\r\npurposes  in order to give them an excuse to  bring\r\n\r\nrepressive  police action and to  detain  political\r\n\r\nopponents.  It is a horrible thought, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nbut it is one to which I must give vent. I think we\r\n\r\nmust be conscious of it. We are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naware  that  the  P.A.P. leadership has  constantly\r\n\r\nsought  to  control  and enslave  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement for political purposes. We are aware  that\r\n\r\neven today, with the break in the T.U.C., there are\r\n\r\nmany  unions  loyal to the P.A.P. and  many  trade\r\n\r\nunionists loyal to the P.A.P. We are aware that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  in  a  position to incite  or  organise\r\n\r\nindustrial unrest. We are aware that the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\na  reputation  for  ruthlessness  well-earned.  The\r\n\r\nquestion,  Mr Speaker, is this: let  us  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  if  any  person or any Party so  abuse  their\r\n\r\nposition in this age as to bring about violence  in\r\n\r\nthe  industrial field for the purposes of achieving\r\n\r\nor maintaining political power, such person or such\r\n\r\nParty  will  forever be damned in the eyes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, it is not inappropriate when we\r\n\r\nconsider whether this Government is worthy  of  our\r\n\r\nconfidence,  not only to note that they  allege  in\r\n\r\none breath that a man is a front man of the Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party and, at the same time, retain  him\r\n\r\nand  make  him knowingly their Political Secretary,\r\n\r\nbut  also  in this very Assembly they  call  him  a\r\n\r\ntraitor,  saying that he has stabbed  them  in  the\r\n\r\nback,  that  he  is  anti-merger  and  opposes  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's declared policy, whilst continuing his\r\n\r\nservice  in the Government. I ask you to recognise,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, that the post of Political  Secretary\r\n\r\nis one at the dispensation of the government of the\r\n\r\nday. It is not a civil service post. The Government\r\n\r\ncan,  at  will,  employ or dismiss whomsoever  they\r\n\r\nthink fit and quite naturally the man employed  for\r\n\r\nsuch  a  post as Political Secretary must have  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of the Government. Yet these people whom\r\n\r\nthey  call  Communists,  traitors,  instigators  of\r\n\r\nriots  or  potential instigators of riots have  not\r\n\r\nbeen dismissed. Wherein, Sir, is the consistency of\r\n\r\nthis  Government,  and  how  does  it  deserve  our\r\n\r\nconfidence  that  it can act in so contradictory  a\r\n\r\nfashion?  Equally,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the   term\r\n\r\n\"traitor\" has been used of eight honourable Members\r\n\r\nopposite.  I  know they can well defend themselves.\r\n\r\nBut  in  assessing the Government as to whether  it\r\n\r\nmerits  a  vote of confidence, apart from its  past\r\n\r\nconduct,  which  I  will not  bore  you  with  this\r\n\r\nafternoon,  let  us recognise that  they  have  not\r\n\r\nsought in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  own  Party  to  deal  with  these  so-called\r\n\r\ntraitors.  But  they  seek  through  a  motion   of\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  this  Assembly,  Mr  Speaker,   to\r\n\r\nintimidate them and their colleagues and to  retain\r\n\r\nthem  in  order  to have some sort  of  a  majority\r\n\r\nwhilst  seeking to deter them from criticising  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  have  been  called  in   emergency\r\n\r\nsession,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I say with  respect  to\r\n\r\nyou,  not for any purpose of national emergency  as\r\n\r\nit  now  transpires, but solely for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nshoring  up  the Prime Minister in his  intra-party\r\n\r\nstruggle  to maintain power against his  own  Party\r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore have\r\n\r\nsuffered almost as much from their leaders - it is  a\r\n\r\nbig  \"almost\" - as from the British, and I say to you\r\n\r\nthat  the  farce  which is being played  out  today\r\n\r\nabout asking the Assembly for a vote of confidence,\r\n\r\nwhich  they have lost in the country, is adding  to\r\n\r\nthe   disillusionment  of  the  people   with   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  process. And so must this  ghost  story\r\n\r\nabout   the  British  seeking  to  bring  about   a\r\n\r\nCommunist  government in Singapore and  this  bogey\r\n\r\nabout  the  issue in Singapore being merger  or  no\r\n\r\nmerger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, this last and most hoary of all\r\n\r\nbogeys - the  Communist Left. We do have  Communists,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir - I believe but I am not sure. But\r\n\r\nI  am  conscious  now that they  neither  have  the\r\n\r\nstrength  nor the influence to affect us materially\r\n\r\nat  this  stage.  I  am  also very  conscious,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, that the tag of \"Communist\" has been  used\r\n\r\nshamelessly,  dishonestly and fraudulently  in  the\r\n\r\npast. I myself have been called a Communist by  one\r\n\r\nnewspaper,  now  defunct, when  I  came  back  from\r\n\r\nChina.  I then realised, Mr Speaker, perhaps  more\r\n\r\nthan  at any other time, how easily the people  can\r\n\r\nbe  deceived and how fraudulently and falsely  this\r\n\r\ntag of Communist can be applied. It is a hoary tag.\r\n\r\nIt  is  one  which the British have used with  very\r\n\r\nconsiderable  success. I must say  it  comes  as  a\r\n\r\nsurprise  that  persons  whom  I  believe  to  have\r\n\r\npolitical  acumen, on the opposite benches,  should\r\n\r\nseek to resuscitate this hoary tag and apply it  to\r\n\r\ntheir  opponents. As the last speaker  has  pointed\r\n\r\nout, Sir, they have gone the full circle of all the\r\n\r\nabuse that they could muster\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Right-Wing  opportunists, Left-Wing deviationists.\r\n\r\nWhat  are  the other terms? I have forgotten  them.\r\n\r\nOh!  Left-Wing  lunatics. And  now  Communist-Left.\r\n\r\nAnything that disagrees with the Prime Minister, of\r\n\r\ncourse.  It  is  significant  that  this   cry   of\r\n\r\nCommunist-Left  is  raised in the  letter  speaking\r\n\r\nabout  industrial unrest which the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nprophesises will be organised by his own  Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries.  It  is  not  that  I  personally   am\r\n\r\nconcerned  for  the  welfare or  freedom  of  these\r\n\r\ngentlemen, but I do remember, Sir, that  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  detained for many years - and so was Dr Chuang\r\n\r\nChu-lin also detained under the P.P.S.O., and he is\r\n\r\nnow the Vice-Chancellor of Nanyang University. They\r\n\r\nwere  detained on the allegation that they  incited\r\n\r\nthe riots and the unhappy events of the latter part\r\n\r\nof  1956.  Sir, the trade unions of Singapore  have\r\n\r\nlearned since the Hock Lee riots that violence  and\r\n\r\nunrest are always to their disadvantage. Riots  are\r\n\r\nalways  an excuse for repressive measures  directed\r\n\r\nagainst  the  workers. I believe that in  Singapore\r\n\r\nmore  than  anywhere else in the world the  workers\r\n\r\nintend   to  exercise  the  utmost  self-restraint,\r\n\r\nwhatever the provocation, because they know that at\r\n\r\nthe  very  first  sign of any riot,  they  will  be\r\n\r\nblamed  and their struggle for social justice  will\r\n\r\nmeet with the grave setback it met with at the  end\r\n\r\nof 1956. The Prime Minister is fully aware that his\r\n\r\nPolitical   Secretaries,  of  whom  he  speaks   as\r\n\r\npossibly  inciting industrial unrest for  political\r\n\r\nobjectives,  have  played  an  admirable  part   in\r\n\r\ninculcating  into  the  workers  of  Singapore   an\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of the dangers of violence  whatever\r\n\r\nthe  provocation, and that they would be  the  last\r\n\r\npeople  on earth to incite industrial violence  for\r\n\r\npolitical objectives; for they know that industrial\r\n\r\nviolence  in this small area, whether with  British\r\n\r\ntroops  or Federation troops, would be crushed  and\r\n\r\nthe  aftermath would be complete elimination of the\r\n\r\nworking  class leaders without trial on the  excuse\r\n\r\nof industrial peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I conclude with an appeal that I have\r\n\r\nmade  for many years and that I make yet once more.\r\n\r\nI ask the sons and daughters of Singapore of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhatever  Party  to reflect quietly  and  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  the  constitution  we  have  is  a  dishonest\r\n\r\nconstitution  incapable of meeting  our  needs  and\r\n\r\nincompatible  with  the requirements  of  a  vital,\r\n\r\ndecent  people.  We  must recognise  that  to  seek\r\n\r\nindependence   through  merger  alone   leaves   us\r\n\r\nhelpless  at the feet of the Federation which  then\r\n\r\nhas  no incentive to co-operate towards merger, for\r\n\r\nit  has power through the Internal Security Council\r\n\r\nto control Singapore without any responsibility and\r\n\r\nwithout any reciprocity, not even the necessity  of\r\n\r\na common market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in assessing this issue as to\r\n\r\nwhether we give this Government our confidence, let\r\n\r\nus recognise that today it has rejected the call of\r\n\r\nindependence preferably with, if necessary without,\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. It is a call which the very people\r\n\r\nwho  spoke  today fully approved not so  very  long\r\n\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if I might take up your time just for a little while. I would like to read to you from\r\n\r\npage  47  of Cmd. Paper No. 31 of 1956. This  is  a\r\n\r\nmemorandum  submitted on behalf  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  with which the Hon, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nand  Mr Lim Ching Siong, as representatives of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  fully  endorsed and associated  themselves\r\n\r\nwith. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is, however, impossible for the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  accept  any  suggestion   that   the\r\n\r\nfulfilment of their constitutional aspirations must\r\n\r\nawait  incorporation  with the  Federation  in  the\r\n\r\nindefinite future. Since we must, we ask  for  such\r\n\r\nfulfilment   now,  whilst  declaring   our   utmost\r\n\r\ngoodwill  and  readiness now and at  all  times  to\r\n\r\nunite with the Federation into a single nation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  Mr  Speaker,  at  page  22,  to  show   the\r\n\r\ninconsistency   of   this   Government   and    its\r\n\r\ninadequacy,  these  are the statements  which  were\r\n\r\nthen accepted by the present Prime Minister and his\r\n\r\ncolleague on behalf of the P.A.P.:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore is small in area, but it has a\r\n\r\npopulation of 1\ufffd million. That population is larger\r\n\r\nthan that of New Zealand when it became a member of\r\n\r\nthe  League  of  Nations and  four  times  that  of\r\n\r\nNewfoundland  when the Statute of Westminster  gave\r\n\r\nit  complete  autonomy. There are at present  seven\r\n\r\nstates   Members   of  the  United   Nations   with\r\n\r\npopulations smaller than that of Singapore, namely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCosta  Rica,  Iceland, Jordan,  Libya,  Luxembourg,\r\n\r\nNicaragua  and Panama. It is only slightly  smaller\r\n\r\nthan  the  population  of three  other  independent\r\n\r\nStates,  Honduras, the Lebanon and Paraguay.  Since\r\n\r\nthere  are ten small countries with populations  of\r\n\r\nless  than  1\ufffd  million  each,  there  can  be   no\r\n\r\njustification  for  saying  that  Singapore  alone,\r\n\r\namong  these  ten,  is  incapable  of  becoming  an\r\n\r\nindependent country.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And at page 23:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`These facts show that Singapore cannot be\r\n\r\nregarded  as  too  small to become  an  independent\r\n\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effectively ... it will have a larger revenue than\r\n\r\nmany of the 54 States Members of the United Nations\r\n\r\nwhose revenues appear superficially to be larger.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, that was the stand with which the P.A.P. fully\r\n\r\nagreed  in  1956. Now we are told that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntotally   rejects  the  idea  of   an   independent\r\n\r\nSingapore and has rejected it ever since the  Party\r\n\r\nwas formed. It considers an independent Singapore a\r\n\r\nfantasy. Mr Speaker, Sir, whether fantasy or  not,\r\n\r\nlet   us   recognise  that  the  struggle  for   an\r\n\r\nindependent   Singapore  is  not   derogatory   but\r\n\r\ncomplementary  to  the  struggle  for  merger.  The\r\n\r\nnearer we come to independence, the greater is  the\r\n\r\nurge  on  the part of the Federation to merge  with\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore. That has  been  to  some\r\n\r\nextent, Mr Speaker, proved in the recent Anson\r\n\r\nby-election.  Merdeka  and merger were  dead  for  two\r\n\r\nyears. Everytime the issue was opened, you know the\r\n\r\nresult.  The Anson by-election came in the  offing,\r\n\r\nand  it  was  known that the issue of  independence\r\n\r\nwould  be the crucial focal issue of Anson. It  was\r\n\r\nthen,  and  then only, Mr Speaker, that the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of the Federation saw fit to make friendly\r\n\r\nnoises about possible closer political and economic\r\n\r\nrelations with Singapore. Let us recognise that  if\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  offer the people an alternative  to  a\r\n\r\nmerger, which we cannot compel, we are leaving them\r\n\r\nhanging in mid-air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is well and good to say,\r\n\r\n\"1963,  merger with the Federation.\" I am  prepared\r\n\r\nto  accept  that,  and  I  believe  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  also prepared to accept  that.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  if  you cannot achieve merger by  1963?  What\r\n\r\nthen?  The Hon. the Prime Minister says,  \"We  will\r\n\r\nthrow up our hand and tell the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish to take over.\" Mr Speaker, surely that  is\r\n\r\na sterile approach. We cannot offer our vital youth\r\n\r\nwho are growing up, who seek their self-respect,  a\r\n\r\npossibility  which is not even a  probability,  and\r\n\r\nthen  the alternative - British rule. I say  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  and we should all of us honestly and sincerely\r\n\r\nseek, concurrently with our efforts for merger,  an\r\n\r\nindependent  Singapore, a Singapore  that  is  more\r\n\r\nviable, as I have just indicated to you, than  many\r\n\r\nStates  which are independent today. Singapore  can\r\n\r\nand  will, if necessary. \"go it alone\". Is that not\r\n\r\npreferable  to throwing up your hand as a  bankrupt\r\n\r\nand putting it in the laps of the British?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. does not accept the concept of independence preferably with, if\r\n\r\nnecessary without, the Federation because it  fears\r\n\r\nthe  loss  of  power for itself. I  say:  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  the people around us seek freedom. They  seek\r\n\r\nself-respect  as a plant seeks air  and  light.  We\r\n\r\ncannot deny this to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  three days ago in his letter in reply  to\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister stated that the call  for  the\r\n\r\nresignation  of  the  Prime Minister  was  made  to\r\n\r\nconfuse  the people over the vital issue of  merger\r\n\r\nwith the Federation. Mr Speaker, it was I who made\r\n\r\nthat  call. I think I have made my stand on  merger\r\n\r\nclear  and there can be no confusion. The call  for\r\n\r\nthe  resignation of the Prime Minister  is  a  call\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people of Singapore for the  end  of  an\r\n\r\noverpowering  personality  who  does   not   permit\r\n\r\ndemocratic  play,  nor  has  he  respect  for   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic principles or the will of the people. It\r\n\r\nis  not,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that I know the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, that I am a friend of  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister who is so terrified of me  that  he\r\n\r\ndoes not recognise me when he sees me. The truth of\r\n\r\nit  is that, were the Prime Minister to resign,  at\r\n\r\nleast  that  would  to  some  extent  assuage   the\r\n\r\nresentment of the people to this Government and  at\r\n\r\nleast   give  an  opportunity  to  this  Party m any\r\n\r\nmembers  of  whom  I have no doubt  are  dedicated,\r\n\r\nsincere   and  honest  and  seek  the  welfare   of\r\n\r\nSingapore - to reorientate itself, to reconsider  its\r\n\r\nposition without the presence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   a  man  who  feels  that  reorientation,   the\r\n\r\nrecognition of a mistake, is in itself  a  dreadful\r\n\r\nthing, and that consistency even in foolishness  is\r\n\r\npreferable to the wisdom learned from mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with regret in this my\r\n\r\nvery  first speech to this House that I should  ask\r\n\r\nthe Asembly to take cognizance of a motion that  is\r\n\r\nunworthy. Mr Speaker, if it had come from the Jaga\r\n\r\nKreta Government, we would have grown accustomed to\r\n\r\nthat  kind  of  conduct. But in the  light  of  the\r\n\r\ndistinction in the stature of the people concerned,\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore were  entitled  and  are\r\n\r\nentitled  to expect greater integrity and sincerity\r\n\r\nand  acceptance  of  the public will.  This  motion\r\n\r\nbefore  the House, more perhaps than any other  act\r\n\r\nof  the Government, displays - if it is not deemed an\r\n\r\nunparliamentary   phrase,  Mr   Speaker - a   shabby\r\n\r\napproach  to government, unworthy of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. And if this motion is persisted in, then\r\n\r\nI   hope   the   conscience  of  the  Backbenchers,\r\n\r\nindependent  human  beings themselves,  would  make\r\n\r\nthem  vote  against this motion even  if  it  means\r\n\r\nfresh  elections. I do not want a  fresh  election,\r\n\r\nhaving  come  through five weeks of it!  Nor  am  I\r\n\r\nunconscious that the alternative to this Government\r\n\r\nis  at  present  unformed.  But  I  say  it  is  an\r\n\r\nunhealthy  thing  for  any government  to  consider\r\n\r\nitself indispensable, for any government to act  in\r\n\r\nsuch   a  fashion - consciously  to  seek  to   bring\r\n\r\nconfusion and throw dust in the eyes of the people,\r\n\r\ncreate  bogies and non-existent bogies in order  to\r\n\r\nfrighten them so that they should be supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the Hon. the Minister for Finance is very\r\n\r\nanxious to take the Floor. Mr Speaker, I thank you\r\n\r\nfor  your  indulgence. I will not keep him  on  the\r\n\r\nleash any longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> As I\r\n\r\nsweated  through that marathon performance  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson, I was just wondering whether  his\r\n\r\nlong absence from this Chamber has so increased his\r\n\r\npowers for lengthy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noratory  that  at  the first opportunity  he  would\r\n\r\ndeliver  such  a long oration to the Assembly.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, as he went on and on repeating  many\r\n\r\nof  his  points  several times, I  thought  perhaps\r\n\r\nafter our defeat in Anson, this was the punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has raised a number of points and I have\r\n\r\nno  doubt my colleagues concerned will answer  them\r\n\r\nat  the  appropriate  time.  But  I  listened  with\r\n\r\ninterest to his remarks on what he termed the bogey\r\n\r\nof  Communism  which has been raised in  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson was at one time the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister of Singapore. When he  was  at  the\r\n\r\nhelm,  he was faced with difficult problems.  There\r\n\r\nwere riots and the expansion of unions by operators\r\n\r\non  behalf of the Malayan Communist Party. So  much\r\n\r\nso,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that when he went to  London\r\n\r\nin April 1956, he had occasion to address a meeting\r\n\r\nof  Malayan students in London, after which  I  met\r\n\r\nhim. At that time, Mr Speaker, Sir, the then Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  did  not  assume the mantle  of  a  great\r\n\r\nLiberal, the opposer of all attempts to make use of\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  smear in order to  liquidate  one's\r\n\r\npolitical  opponents. What he said at the students'\r\n\r\nunion  would be on record, and perhaps one of these\r\n\r\ndays  we may be able to publish the minutes of that\r\n\r\nmeeting. But after the meeting, he met me and spoke\r\n\r\nto me in earnest, almost desperate, terms. He said,\r\n\r\n\"Though you are a close friend of Lee Kuan Yew,  do\r\n\r\nyou  know  that  he is giving legal  cover  to  the\r\n\r\nCommunists so that they can expand their  influence\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  in  the unions,  in  the  students'\r\n\r\nassociations,  cultural bodies? And that  Lee  Kuan\r\n\r\nYew is using his considerable skill as a lawyer  to\r\n\r\ngive  Communist operators the legal protection that\r\n\r\nthey  need  for the consolidation and expansion  of\r\n\r\ntheir  Party?\" And he begged of me to  persuade  my\r\n\r\nfriend to disavow his presence so that he, as Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, could take action against them. Sir, that\r\n\r\nis  a long cry from the present stand of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson. Indeed, I might say that the circle has\r\n\r\nmade  a  complete turn. I will come  back  to  this\r\n\r\nsubject in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the comments from the two Government\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries on the absence  of  what\r\n\r\nthey  term \"intra-party democracy\", the  allegedly\r\n\r\ndictatorial  methods of the Party  leadership,  and\r\n\r\nthe centralisation of power and decision-making  in\r\n\r\na  small body of the leadership. Sir, much of  what\r\n\r\nthey  say  is  already familiar to this  House.  In\r\n\r\nfact, a stronger case had already been made by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong  Lim who gave more  examples  and\r\n\r\nspoke with even greater heat and passion because he\r\n\r\nhimself had been the object of disciplinary  action\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the  Party under its  Constitution.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim roundly condemned the  absence\r\n\r\nof  party  democracy in the P.A.P. So when  he  was\r\n\r\nexpelled,  he  formed  a new party,  whose  name  I\r\n\r\nbelieve is the United People's Party. Sir,  he  has\r\n\r\napplied  for  registration  and  we  are  therefore\r\n\r\nprovided  with  a  copy of his Party  Constitution.\r\n\r\nMembers   will   be  amazed  to   know   that   the\r\n\r\nConstitution of that Party is practically identical\r\n\r\nwith that of the P.A.P., and that, in so far as the\r\n\r\nclauses differ from the P.A.P., it is to strengthen\r\n\r\nand  centralise  power in their  Central  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee.  So, Mr Speaker. Sir,  let  us  not  be\r\n\r\ndeceived by all this humbug.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir, Is\r\n\r\nit  proper  for a Minister to refer to confidential\r\n\r\ncommunications sent in by a political Party in open\r\n\r\nassembly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order for me.\r\n\r\nDr Goh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that document is not\r\n\r\nconfidential.

It is open to them, if they so violently\r\n\r\ndisagree  with the way in which party  affairs  are\r\n\r\nconducted,  to leave the Party, form a new  one,  a\r\n\r\nmore  democratic Party, one hopes,  and  avoid  the\r\n\r\nexample  of  their predecessors. Far from  carrying\r\n\r\nout  the  conclusions to which  his  criticisms  of\r\n\r\nparty organisation would lead, the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  has,  in  fact, followed in  almost  identical\r\n\r\nterms  the structure and organisation of the  Party\r\n\r\nwhich he has condemned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why is it necessary for political Parties in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  have  constitutions  which  are   so\r\n\r\nseverely centralised? The Member for Hong Lim is no\r\n\r\nchicken.  He  has been with us for many  years.  He\r\n\r\nknows  what  the issues are. He has seen  Pandora's\r\n\r\nBox opened and on one occasion he has been stung by\r\n\r\nthe  bees  that came out of that box. To understand\r\n\r\nwhy  political Parties organised by people who have\r\n\r\ngone  through  this phase of Singapore's  political\r\n\r\ndevelopment  adopt  certain safeguards  within  the\r\n\r\nconstitution, I therefore say that it is to prevent\r\n\r\ntheir  Party from being captured by forces who  owe\r\n\r\nno loyalty to the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the central\r\n\r\ntheme   developed  in  the  speech  of  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  It is now no longer possible for  us  in\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to gloss over the differences  between\r\n\r\nthe Communists and ourselves. There was a time when\r\n\r\nwe  were  colleagues in the anti-colonial struggle,\r\n\r\nand  the ordinary dictates of decency demand of  us\r\n\r\nthat  we  should give to those who are fighting  as\r\n\r\ncomrades-in-arms the maximum cover  and  protection\r\n\r\nthat  we could afford. But now the parting of  ways\r\n\r\nhas taken place. We owe them no obligation, for  it\r\n\r\nis  they  who  took the initiative in forcing  this\r\n\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to develop the theme which the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has described in his speech, and  that  is\r\n\r\nthe  analysis  of  events in  the  last  few  weeks\r\n\r\nwhereby  the  British intervened on  the  political\r\n\r\nstage  in Singapore to bring about certain  results\r\n\r\nwhich  they thought would be advantageous to  them.\r\n\r\nIt  has  been our habit to heap all kinds of  abuse\r\n\r\nupon the colonialists. They are represented as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncruel, oppressive, unjust, inhuman, rapacious,  and\r\n\r\nso  on and so forth. But there is one attribute  of\r\n\r\nthe   British  imperialists  to  which   inadequate\r\n\r\nattention had been paid. And this is their  cunning\r\n\r\nand  their skill and experience in manipulating men\r\n\r\nto their own advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great scheme of theirs which the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister had revealed emphasises that we must never\r\n\r\nunder-estimate  our  adversary,  particularly   his\r\n\r\ncapacity  for diabolical scheming. The  scheme  has\r\n\r\nbeen  set  on foot only during the last few  months\r\n\r\nand shows that it has not only been conceived by  a\r\n\r\nmaster-mind  but  that it has  been  executed  with\r\n\r\nconsummate skill and precision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to give some details of this plot and\r\n\r\nthe  way  it  was carried out and its effect  on  a\r\n\r\nnarrow  sector of the political stage.  I  want  to\r\n\r\ndescribe  in  some detail what has  happened,  when\r\n\r\nevents  took their course, among a group of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders in the Assembly. More specifically, I  want\r\n\r\nto refer to the revolt of the eight Assemblymen led\r\n\r\nby the Member for Queenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

As the Prime Minister said,  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  main objectives is to encourage the Communists\r\n\r\nand  their supporters to break away from the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand attack it both from outside and from within. In\r\n\r\norder  to achieve this objective, it is vital  that\r\n\r\nthe  British should convince the Communists of  two\r\n\r\npoints, otherwise no action ensues. First, that the\r\n\r\nBritish would convince the Communists that it would\r\n\r\nallow   a   pro-Communist  or  even   a   Communist\r\n\r\ngovernment to take charge of Singapore provided the\r\n\r\nCommunists\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagree  not to disturb their military bases. For  so\r\n\r\nlong  as  the Communists believe that they  are  in\r\n\r\nperil  of  repressive action by the  British,  they\r\n\r\nwill  continue, as they had done in  the  past,  to\r\n\r\nhide behind the P.A.P. They cannot be persuaded  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  the  P.A.P. unless their fear  of  British\r\n\r\nrepressive  action is dispelled. The British  must,\r\n\r\ntherefore, convince the Communists that so  far  as\r\n\r\nthe British are concerned, the Communists stand  in\r\n\r\nno danger of suppression by force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must next convince the Communists that the\r\n\r\nplan  for  a greater merger is ready for  immediate\r\n\r\nimplementation. For the Communists understand  that\r\n\r\nwith internal security in the hands of Tengku Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman's Government, they stand in great danger  of\r\n\r\nsuppression by the Federation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the Communists are convinced that merger or\r\n\r\nsuper  merger is around the corner, they will  jump\r\n\r\nlike  prawns in hot water. For their own  survival,\r\n\r\nthey must take all action to wreck the scheme.  And\r\n\r\nto  do so, they must mount an assault on the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto capture it if possible, to destroy it if not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first condition, that is, the British\r\n\r\nassurance  that  they  are quite  safe,  therefore,\r\n\r\nserves  to  remove any inhibitions  the  Communists\r\n\r\nwould  have  in  openly attacking  the  P.A.P.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  condition,  that is, expectation  of  early\r\n\r\nmerger, provides them with the urgent, indeed dire,\r\n\r\nnecessity to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to tell the House how admirably the British\r\n\r\nhad succeeded in convincing the Communists on these\r\n\r\ntwo  points  and how the Communists  in  turn  have\r\n\r\nsought to manipulate some of the weaker brethren in\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. to open fire on their colleagues even to\r\n\r\nthe extent of treachery and betrayal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been observing the conduct and opinions\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs for a very long time.  It\r\n\r\nwas   clear  to  me  that  for  some  time  he  was\r\n\r\nadvocating  the policy of a united front  with  the\r\n\r\nCommunists on their own\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterms,   and  accordingly  I  held  a   number   of\r\n\r\ndiscussions  to  find out what his real  intentions\r\n\r\nwere   and   whether   he  fully   understood   the\r\n\r\nconsequences of the policy he was advocating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have known the Parliamentary Secretary as a\r\n\r\npersonal  friend for a great number  of  years.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  our  friendship began over the chess  board,\r\n\r\nand  he  is  a player of no mean ability.  You  can\r\n\r\njudge a man's character by his style of play. Chess\r\n\r\nplayers  are  of  many  kinds.  Some  persons   are\r\n\r\ncautious  and calculating by nature, and they  play\r\n\r\nthe  game to obtain long-term strategic advantages.\r\n\r\nOther players are bold and prefer complications and\r\n\r\ncombinations  on  the  chess  board  to  get  quick\r\n\r\nresults.  Some  again  are bold  to  the  point  of\r\n\r\nrecklessness  so that they readily embark  on  what\r\n\r\nchess players call speculative moves. These involve\r\n\r\nthe   taking   of   great  risks   without   proper\r\n\r\ncalculations  in  the hope of achieving  early  and\r\n\r\nspectacular  victory. If the moves  come  off,  the\r\n\r\nadversary is soon overwhelmed. If they do not  come\r\n\r\noff,  the game is lost with equal rapidity. I  have\r\n\r\nnever  known  the Parliamentary Secretary  to  lack\r\n\r\ncourage  in making speculative moves on  the  chess\r\n\r\nboard. And so it is that this man has initiated, on\r\n\r\nthe  political chess board, moves which I can  only\r\n\r\ndescribe   as  speculative  in  the  extreme,   the\r\n\r\nconsequences of which to himself and to the country\r\n\r\nhe  has  not properly calculated. When you lose  at\r\n\r\nchess,  you will replace the pieces and you play  a\r\n\r\nnew game. But in the affairs of the country, you do\r\n\r\nnot  replace pieces and play a new game  after  you\r\n\r\nhave  lost. You are playing not only with your  own\r\n\r\nlives but with the lives of other men and women and\r\n\r\ntheir families, and you take the consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now describe what took place in the\r\n\r\ndiscussions between the Parliamentary Secretary and\r\n\r\nmyself during quite a number of sessions I had with\r\n\r\nhim. He was extremely depressed after our defeat at\r\n\r\nHong  Lim. He claimed that the Party had completely\r\n\r\nlost the confidence of the people. He enumerated  a\r\n\r\nlong list of errors which we have made and demanded\r\n\r\nthat they be rectified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere  was  no  difficulty in getting agreement  on\r\n\r\nthese  points. Some of them I conceded to him,  and\r\n\r\nwith  regard to the others he accepted my point  of\r\n\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on one point we could not agree, and that is\r\n\r\nthat the Parliamentary Secretary declared that  the\r\n\r\nsalvation of the P.A.P. lies in full and  open  \r\n\r\nco-operation  with  the  Communists.  Sir,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nmincing my words here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come on!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In our discussions that we\r\n\r\nhad,  we  did not use vague terms such as  \"extreme\r\n\r\nLeft\"  or  \"Leftist socialists\".  We  were  talking\r\n\r\nabout  the  Communists and both he and I understood\r\n\r\nwhat we meant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I posed to him the question whether he had\r\n\r\nunderstood  the risk involved in such a  course  of\r\n\r\naction. I said to him, \"If you are a Communist  and\r\n\r\nact  as one, you have no cause to regret should any\r\n\r\nill  consequences  befall you. You  understand  the\r\n\r\nideology; you are dedicated to the cause,  and  you\r\n\r\nare prepared for the sacrifices. But if you are not\r\n\r\na  Communist  and try to toe their line,  then  you\r\n\r\nhave  only  yourself to blame if  events  overwhelm\r\n\r\nyou.\"  Now, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary is  no\r\n\r\nCommunist.  He  does not even understand  the  most\r\n\r\nelementary  tenets of Marxism-Leninism.  Indeed,  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of  his behaviour and activity  rather\r\n\r\nsuggest  to me the conduct of a foolish virgin  who\r\n\r\nhas  entered into a brothel area and proclaimed the\r\n\r\nbrotherhood of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did he want to embark on this hazardous\r\n\r\ncourse? He wants mass popularity for the Party  and\r\n\r\nfor himself which he thinks only the Communists can\r\n\r\nprovide. I repeatedly asked him whether or  not  he\r\n\r\nhad  calculated  the consequences. Everybody  knows\r\n\r\nthe  importance of Singapore as a British  military\r\n\r\nbase.  It  holds a pivotal position in the  defence\r\n\r\nsystem  of the British in South-East Asia. I  asked\r\n\r\nhim  if  he imagined that the British would refrain\r\n\r\nfrom  using  force to crush any Communist  or  \r\n\r\npro-Communist  movement which threatens their security,\r\n\r\nas must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  the  case. For Communism is a world force,  and\r\n\r\nevery  local  Communist movement is geared  to  the\r\n\r\nworld  Communist revolution. These are simple basic\r\n\r\naxioms  from  which  any  political  analysis  must\r\n\r\nproceed. The Parliamentary Secretary came out  with\r\n\r\na  light-hearted  reply  that,  in  his  view,  the\r\n\r\nBritish  will  not  use  force  on  the  Communists\r\n\r\nbecause he knew the Communists have decided not  to\r\n\r\nuse  force on the British. In fact, the Communists,\r\n\r\nhe  said, are not in a position in Singapore to use\r\n\r\narmed revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Do not twist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> And accordingly they are\r\n\r\nprepared  to accept the retention of British  bases\r\n\r\non  the island and there is therefore no reason for\r\n\r\nthe  British to suppress them. Sir, I have spent  a\r\n\r\nlong  time  with  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to\r\n\r\nconvince him of the error of his assumption. But  I\r\n\r\ncould  not move him from that position. It is clear\r\n\r\nthat   the   British  had  attained   their   first\r\n\r\nobjective.  They had convinced the Communists  that\r\n\r\nit  is safe for them to proceed, and the Communists\r\n\r\nin  turn have convinced the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nthat  no ill consequences would follow his throwing\r\n\r\nin his lot with them. On the contrary, he would get\r\n\r\nthe advantage of mass popularity and the support of\r\n\r\ntheir  mass organisations in Singapore. And in  the\r\n\r\nend, Sir, a delectable prize to win - the Premiership\r\n\r\nof  Singapore! Thus it was that the Communists have\r\n\r\nsecured   an  important  foothold  in  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership from which they could attack  the  Party\r\n\r\nfrom  within.  This, it should be  noted,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nentirely  in  accordance  with  British  plans  and\r\n\r\nexpectations - the destruction of the P.A.P. by  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  in the first phase so as to leave  them\r\n\r\nunencumbered  freedom of action to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nCommunists in the final round.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second element of the British move to lure the\r\n\r\nCommunists into open conflict with the P.A.P. is to\r\n\r\nconvince them of the imminence of super merger. The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has described the various open moves\r\n\r\nwhich  the  British had made to  bring  about  this\r\n\r\nstate of mind among the Communist open\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleadership - visits   of   High   Commissioners   and\r\n\r\ngenerals, trips to London by the noble Lord and  so\r\n\r\non.  I  now want to discuss the effects on some  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. members once the Communists themselves\r\n\r\nhave  been  brought into this state of  mind.  Many\r\n\r\nmembers,  some  in  high  positions  in  the  Party\r\n\r\nhierarchy,  continually call upon the Ministers  to\r\n\r\ntake  them  into  their confidence and  reveal  the\r\n\r\ndetails  of this super merger. Indeed at this  very\r\n\r\nmeeting  of  the Assembly, Members have heard  from\r\n\r\nanother Parliamentary Secretary the appeal for  the\r\n\r\nrevelation  of  details of this  great  scheme.  So\r\n\r\nconvinced  were they that some evil plot  has  been\r\n\r\nhatched to fix the Communists that they never fully\r\n\r\nbelieved our reply that we do not know the details,\r\n\r\nfor  the simple reason that a super merger  was  no\r\n\r\nmore  than  a  general  proposition  put  forth  by\r\n\r\npolitical  leaders  in various  countries  in  this\r\n\r\narea. The stage has not even been reached where the\r\n\r\nGovernments  concerned have even begun  preliminary\r\n\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the British in deceiving the\r\n\r\nCommunists has now been complete. But how did  they\r\n\r\npull  off  this spectacular psychological coup?  We\r\n\r\nknow  the  broad  outlines. We  know  some  of  the\r\n\r\ndetails,   the  goings-on  between  the   Communist\r\n\r\nsupporters   and   sympathisers   and   the    U.K.\r\n\r\nCommission.   The  lunches,  dinners  and   private\r\n\r\ndiscussions  and cocktail parties which  they  had.\r\n\r\nFor  the  British to have pulled off  this \r\n\r\nmaster-stroke,  which  can  only be  done  through  hints,\r\n\r\nsuggestions  and  innuendoes, certain  arrangements\r\n\r\nare necessary for success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing events in the recent past, and piecing\r\n\r\ntogether  the  information that we have  about  the\r\n\r\ndiscussions  between the lion and the  bear,  I  am\r\n\r\nirresistibly drawn to certain conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Ching Siong, in a Press statement yesterday, warned his followers against agents\r\n\r\nprovocateurs who, he alleged, had been  planted  by\r\n\r\nthe wicked P.A.P. Government to create disturbances\r\n\r\nin  the  trade unions. This allegation is as stupid\r\n\r\nas it is unfounded. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  is  not the point. The point I am  making  is\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Lim Ching Siong should, at the beginning\r\n\r\nof  this whole exercise, have taken heed of his own\r\n\r\nwarning   himself   and   guard   against    agents\r\n\r\nprovocateurs  whom the British had planted  in  his\r\n\r\nmidst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole exercise of convincing the Communists of\r\n\r\nthese  two  fundamental  points - first,  that  they\r\n\r\ncould  operate  with safety even to the  extent  of\r\n\r\nforming  their  own government,  and  second,  that\r\n\r\nsuper merger is around the corner - has been achieved\r\n\r\nin the course of a few brief months. To bring about\r\n\r\nthe  desired state of mind among the top  Communist\r\n\r\nleaders,  it is essential to the British that  they\r\n\r\nshould  be able to use, for their purposes, men  in\r\n\r\nwhom  the  Communists have reposed  confidence  and\r\n\r\nupon  whom  they  rely  to give  an  evaluation  of\r\n\r\nBritish  intentions. The top decision-makers  among\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  are  all  Chinese  educated.  They\r\n\r\ncannot be fully sure of their own interpretation of\r\n\r\nwhat the British say or do, and they must therefore\r\n\r\nseek  the  opinion  and advice of  those  who  know\r\n\r\nBritish  minds better. Mr Lim Ching  Siong  should\r\n\r\nnow  review the interpretations which his\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated  comrades  have made  to  him  on  British\r\n\r\npolicy  as expounded in their discussions with  the\r\n\r\nBritish.  He  will then find a pattern emerging  of\r\n\r\nhow  he  was  slowly  but  surely  brought  to  the\r\n\r\nposition  where  he  fell for  the  lure  that  was\r\n\r\noffered and was finally played for the sucker. From\r\n\r\nthis pattern, he can draw his own conclusions. None\r\n\r\nof us want traitors in our midst, and no traitor is\r\n\r\nmore  reprehensible  than one  who  works  for  the\r\n\r\nimperialists. They have done the Communists a great\r\n\r\ndeal of harm. They have also inflicted injuries  on\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. We, the P.A.P., and the Communists, have\r\n\r\na common interest in their eradication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me wind up with a few\r\n\r\nremarks  about  the performers in the  great  drama\r\n\r\nthat  is  unfolding itself before our eyes.  First,\r\n\r\nthere  are the men who decide the course of events.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the men who understand the  reality  of\r\n\r\npower  as  distinct  from  the  illusion  and   the\r\n\r\nsensation  of  power.  They are  the  British,  the\r\n\r\nCommunists and ourselves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  P.A.P. who  are  responsible  for  making\r\n\r\nultimate  decisions.  All  these  three  understand\r\n\r\nthat, as the famous dictum of Mao Tse-tung puts it,\r\n\r\n\"power comes out of the barrel of the gun\".\r\n\r\nMao Tse-tung  went  on  further  to  say  that  every  good\r\n\r\nCommunist  must understand this basic  proposition.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the Communists in Singapore, they\r\n\r\nsuffered  a  temporary  lapse  during  which   they\r\n\r\noverlooked  Mao's advice and allowed themselves  to\r\n\r\nbe beguiled by those who held the gun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the principal actors. Then, among the\r\n\r\nsupporting cast, you find a variety of types.  This\r\n\r\nis  a curious thing in Singapore, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nWhen  great and momentous events are taking  place,\r\n\r\nfor  no  rhyme  or  reason, clowns  appear  on  the\r\n\r\npolitical  stage, to the merriment and exhilaration\r\n\r\nof  all  around,  only to confuse the  picture  and\r\n\r\nprevent  the  proper clarification of  events.  But\r\n\r\nthere  are  earnest  and  sincere  people  in  this\r\n\r\nsupporting cast who lack experience and breadth and\r\n\r\ndepth of knowledge. As a result, some of them  have\r\n\r\nallowed  themselves to stray away from the path  of\r\n\r\nrectitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again there are those who are less honest\r\n\r\nand  sincere. They are driven by ambition and  lust\r\n\r\nfor  power  which  regrettably is  not  matched  by\r\n\r\nsagacity of judgment. Whatever else happens in  the\r\n\r\nfuture,  these are the persons that must meet  with\r\n\r\ndisaster because they are unable themselves to  see\r\n\r\nthe  pitfalls and traps that lie ahead and they are\r\n\r\nunwilling  to accept the advice of wiser  and  more\r\n\r\nexperienced  men. Sir, the last act of  this  drama\r\n\r\nhas yet to be played. For our part, we can say that\r\n\r\nour  minds  have  penetrated  beyond  external  and\r\n\r\nsuperficial  manifestations into the roots  of  the\r\n\r\npower  situation.  We  have  accordingly  made  our\r\n\r\npreparations  for  each and every eventuality  that\r\n\r\nmay arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I wonder very much why a Government  which\r\n\r\nhas  39  seats  can  ask the  Assembly  to  give  a\r\n\r\nconfidence  vote to it. The fact  that  it  has  39\r\n\r\nseats  very clearly tells the Government  that  its\r\n\r\nvote  of  confidence rests with these 39 seats.  It\r\n\r\nalso rests with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n51  branches of the P.A.P. Why does the  Government\r\n\r\nnot  want to seek confidence from the Party and the\r\n\r\nAssemblymen   instead  of  seeking  it   from   the\r\n\r\nOpposition? Does it mean that the Opposition's vote\r\n\r\ncan be more trusted? Whether there is confidence or\r\n\r\nnot,  it  is  a matter to be considered within  the\r\n\r\nParty.  Treating  the Party's internal  affairs  as\r\n\r\npolitical  issues in the Assembly  may  perhaps  be\r\n\r\npermissible, but then the consequences will be very\r\n\r\nmiserable and deplorable. Intra-party disputes must\r\n\r\nbe  dealt with by Party members. In this particular\r\n\r\ncase,  the dispute arose because there was lack  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  in the Party and because the  leadership\r\n\r\nhad  deviated from the correct path. There  was  no\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  Because of this, the eight  Assemblymen\r\n\r\non  the  Government  side and the  three  Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries wanted to rectify the wrong path  taken\r\n\r\nby  the  Party leadership. The intra-party struggle\r\n\r\nis  a  very simple and common affair, but the Party\r\n\r\nleadership have disregarded our request. They  have\r\n\r\ndivided  us and accused us of being Communists  and\r\n\r\nthat  they must necessarily be democratic Leftists.\r\n\r\nI   regard  this  accusation  as  an  act  of   the\r\n\r\ncolonialists or their agents. It is not  surprising\r\n\r\nthat  they  have adopted this tactic of  slandering\r\n\r\nus.  But the most surprising thing is that the \r\n\r\nso-called  democratic people can resort to reactionary\r\n\r\nactivities.  They have always tried to treat  those\r\n\r\nwho disagree with them as questionable people. This\r\n\r\nattitude  of  not  willing or  refusing  to  accept\r\n\r\ncriticism will not be good for the political future\r\n\r\nof  the  people concerned. It will not realise  the\r\n\r\nlong-term  objectives of the Party. The  defeat  of\r\n\r\nthe  Party  in  the Hong Lim and Anson by-elections\r\n\r\nwas  blamed on the extreme Left-wing elements, but,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  this  was  due to the  Party  leadership\r\n\r\nhaving  deviated  from the correct political  path.\r\n\r\nThey want to confuse the vision of the people. They\r\n\r\nwant  to come to terms with the Right-wing and\r\n\r\npro-colonial elements. This action has to be contained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the correspondence exchanged between the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and the Deputy Prime Minister,  there  is\r\n\r\nmention  of  the Prime Minister wanting to  resign.\r\n\r\nThree  points were mentioned in the correspondence.\r\n\r\nOne point was that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment will have to take some unpleasant action\r\n\r\nin  the  interest of the people.

The  unpleasant\r\n\r\naction  is  to be carried out for the sake  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists.  The correspondence goes  on  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  three  Political Secretaries  and  eight\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  are  guilty  of  open  rebellion   and\r\n\r\ntreachery. I do not exactly know what is  meant  by\r\n\r\n\"treachery\".  Is it treachery to ask the  Party  to\r\n\r\nrectify the wrong path taken? Can this be construed\r\n\r\nas  treachery? In the Prime Minister's  letter,  he\r\n\r\nsays   that   he  always  believes  in   collective\r\n\r\nleadership. We have taken part in affairs  relating\r\n\r\nto   government  and  we  have  also  had  business\r\n\r\ndealings with the Party.

At the same time, I received short notice by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister about the motion,  \"That  this\r\n\r\nHouse  expresses its confidence in the Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe  Assembly  was adjourned only  one  day  before\r\n\r\nAnson Polling Day. That sitting was supposed to  be\r\n\r\nthe  last sitting of the Session. Today the Chinese\r\n\r\nPress  printed  news of this special  sitting.  The\r\n\r\nconvening  of  this  special  sitting  today   will\r\n\r\nstimulate the minds of those who are concerned with\r\n\r\npolitics.  To  those who are more  sensitive,  this\r\n\r\nwill appear like an impending thunderstorm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very much puzzled at this\r\n\r\nmotion.  I do not understand its purpose,  for  the\r\n\r\nParty in power still has 39 seats. Our position  in\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly is very secure indeed and  cannot  be\r\n\r\nshakened by the Opposition. Could it be because the\r\n\r\nFour-Party   Alliance  candidate  has   asked   our\r\n\r\nMinisters to resign? Or could it be due to the fact\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Anson has challenged us? If the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanswer is yes to each of these two questions,  then\r\n\r\nthere is no necessity to introduce this motion here\r\n\r\nor   to  ask  Opposition  Members  to  state  their\r\n\r\nconfidence in the Government. This is an impossible\r\n\r\nsituation.  It  is  clear that the  39  Assemblymen\r\n\r\nsitting  on this side of the House can outvote  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true picture is very clear. The introduction\r\n\r\nof  this  motion  is really because of  intra-party\r\n\r\ndisputes.  Our conflicts should be resolved  within\r\n\r\nthe  Party  instead of raising this motion  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  which is inappropriate and a mistake.  I\r\n\r\nearnestly  ask the Prime Minister to  withdraw  his\r\n\r\nmotion  and let the issue be decided by the highest\r\n\r\nauthorities of the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in raising the motion, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   gave   an  analysis  of  the   political\r\n\r\nsituation  in Singapore and asked the  Assembly  to\r\n\r\nexpress  its confidence in the Government. But  now\r\n\r\nlet us think coolly and objectively about the whole\r\n\r\nsituation.   Its  causes  and  results.   This   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  and correct. If in our hurry  to  tackle\r\n\r\nthe problem we are not able to find the core of the\r\n\r\nproblem, then this will be a mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the People's Action Party was\r\n\r\nfounded  in  1954  on the basis of anti-colonialism\r\n\r\nthrough  constitutional struggle  so  as  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  a  united  and  socialist  Malaya.  Tens  of\r\n\r\nthousands  of  members and  I  took  part  in  this\r\n\r\nstruggle.  After many crises, we won  43  seats  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  with the support of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  we  were able to  form  the  first\r\n\r\ninternal  self-governing  State.  This  unsurpassed\r\n\r\nvictory was the product of a struggle lasting  five\r\n\r\nyears.  Unfortunately, dissensions and provocations\r\n\r\namong comrades in the Party led to the expulsion of\r\n\r\nthe former Minister for National Development. As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  Anson  by-election,  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  has  now  only  39  seats  in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  As a loyal member of the Party,  I  have\r\n\r\nseen  the Party's prestige drop in the eyes of  the\r\n\r\npeople  and its political objectives becoming  more\r\n\r\nand  more vague. Therefore, I think we should  have\r\n\r\nthe  right to air our views constructively.  It  is\r\n\r\nour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduty  to  criticise  and engage in  self-criticism.\r\n\r\nBeing   a   socialist  political  Party  based   on\r\n\r\ncollective   leadership,  it  is   necessary   that\r\n\r\nquestions  in principle are submitted to  a  bigger\r\n\r\norganisation  for  discussion and  decision.  Eight\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  wrote  to the Party Central  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  asking  the  leadership  to  convene   a\r\n\r\nmeeting  of  the 51 P.A.P. Branches to discuss  the\r\n\r\nproblems  facing the socialist movement in  Malaya,\r\n\r\nespecially  the Greater Malaysia scheme  propounded\r\n\r\nby  the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya,\r\n\r\nTunku  Abdul Rahman. This proposal for a merger  is\r\n\r\nnow  bigger  in  scope than the one sought  by  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party. In principle,  this  scheme\r\n\r\nmerits    our   support   and   discussion.    But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, this scheme was made public  by  Mr\r\n\r\nDevan  Nair  on  behalf  of the  Central  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee.  This is heart-breaking and  unpleasant.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, two days before the  letter  was\r\n\r\npublished,  the  results of the  Anson  by-election\r\n\r\nwere  announced,  and  our  People's  Action  Party\r\n\r\ncandidate,  comrade Awang, lost to Mr Marshall  by\r\n\r\n500-odd votes. That is the important reason why the\r\n\r\nGovernment have introduced a motion seeking a  vote\r\n\r\nof confidence in the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will have read from the\r\n\r\nnewspapers yesterday of a letter from the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the P.A.P. to the Party's Chairman,  and\r\n\r\nhis  reply. This highly exciting and dramatic  news\r\n\r\nstunned the whole political arena in Singapore. The\r\n\r\nlast  paragraph  of the letter from the \r\n\r\nSecretary-General reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am quite prepared to assume leadership of the\r\n\r\ngovernment  on behalf of the party provided  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  clear wish of the party executive and  of  the\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  who  will  have  to  follow  us   into\r\n\r\nbattle.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am grateful to the Party's\r\n\r\nChairman  for his act of convening a special  Party\r\n\r\nmeeting  for Assemblymen, but the eight Assemblymen\r\n\r\nwere not invited to that meeting. After a report by\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman, the Assemblymen were asked  to  give\r\n\r\ntheir opinions. At the same time, he requested  all\r\n\r\nthe  Assemblymen to sign a letter  to  the  Central\r\n\r\nExecutive Committee. The result of the dispute  was\r\n\r\nthat five Assemblymen, including myself, refused\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  sign  the letter. At that time we said that  we\r\n\r\nwould   submit  our  memorandum  to   the   Central\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee to clarify our views.  Had  we\r\n\r\nsigned   that  letter,  it  would  not  have   been\r\n\r\nnecessary for us to meet here today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason why we did not sign\r\n\r\nthat  letter  was  that we take  objection  to  the\r\n\r\nanalysis  contained in the letter of the \r\n\r\nSecretary-General.  We  are not manipulated or influenced  by\r\n\r\nanybody. What we are concerned with are the Party's\r\n\r\nfundamental principles and its long-term objectives\r\n\r\nand   their  gradual  implementation.  We  are  not\r\n\r\ninterested in personal fame, status and wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not wish to be\r\n\r\nrevolutionary  heroes, nor do we  wish  to  be  the\r\n\r\nnation's enemies. We only wish to be loyal  members\r\n\r\nof  the  People's  Action  Party.  We  want  to  be\r\n\r\nordinary persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the democratic system means\r\n\r\nthe  invention  of  all  sorts  of  adjectives   to\r\n\r\ndescribe all those who do not agree, then this will\r\n\r\nnot  be  convincing to us. If the one man one  vote\r\n\r\nsystem is used to bring intra-party matters to  the\r\n\r\nAssembly, then the result is not conceivable. Here,\r\n\r\nI  honestly  and sincerely hope the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwill withdraw his motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as\r\n\r\nI  said  during  the debate on the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech  in August 1960, when  blank  fall\r\n\r\nout,  honest men will come into their own.  I  have\r\n\r\nnot  used  the word \"rogues\" because  I  know  that\r\n\r\nhonourable  men are not rogues. They are honourable\r\n\r\nmen  who  have  been  elected  by  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore to look after the destinies of the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in June 1959 when the P.A.P. scored,\r\n\r\naccording  to them, a very overwhelming victory  of\r\n\r\n43 seats in an Assembly of 51, although they polled\r\n\r\nonly 54 per cent of the total votes cast, they came\r\n\r\nto  the  Assembly dressed in pure white and claimed\r\n\r\nthat  they  who  came in pure white  were  a  good,\r\n\r\nclean,  honest Government. Today they are no longer\r\n\r\nin pure white. I do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow. After two years of it there must have been  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  stain that has stuck, so much so  that  we\r\n\r\nfind   even  Parliamentary  Secretaries   who   are\r\n\r\n\"Assistant Ministers\" in the Cabinet coming out now\r\n\r\nin  this Assembly telling the Prime Minister  where\r\n\r\nhe was wrong, calling him names which we called him\r\n\r\nfor  the  last two years - that the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nwas  nothing but a dictatorial Government, that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leaders were nothing but arrogant  leaders.\r\n\r\nThese  charges were denied from that  side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse. But today, Sir, from the mouths of their own\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries,  they  say  that  their\r\n\r\nleaders  are arrogant. They say that their  leaders\r\n\r\nare  dictatorial.  This  is  indeed,  Sir,  a  very\r\n\r\npathetic day for the leadership of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when they lost the Anson by-election, it was\r\n\r\nleft   to   the  defeated  P.A.P. candidate,   the\r\n\r\nPresident of the T.U.C., to say, \"That's all right.\r\n\r\nIt  was  not a bad defeat. We only lost by a  small\r\n\r\nmajority.  We  are not worried. We will  remain  in\r\n\r\noffice.\"  That  was  Sunday. On Monday,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said, \"We carry on.\" On Tuesday, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's side of the T.U.C. said that  the  other\r\n\r\nside  of  the T.U.C. which was not with  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is  all wrong and is trying to  stab  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership in the back. And on Wednesday  we\r\n\r\nare  treated  to  the sight of the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nexchanging letters with the Deputy Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\ngiving  full publicity to \"Dear comrade\"  here  and\r\n\r\n\"Dear comrade\" there. So we thought that everything\r\n\r\nwas all right. It would appear that they wanted  to\r\n\r\ncarry on. All right, if they want to carry on,  let\r\n\r\nthem  carry on. We were waiting for the  time  when\r\n\r\nthe  Leader  of  the House would  inform  you,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, of the next sitting of this Assembly.\r\n\r\nSuddenly  we had to rely on that P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\npolitical  propaganda machine, Radio Singapore,  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  the  Prime  Minister  had  tendered  his\r\n\r\nresignation   and   that  the   Central   Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  of the P.A.P. had told him to  carry  on \r\n\r\n- \"Don't  worry. You've done a good job.\" And  later\r\n\r\non in the evening we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  told  that there was going to  be  a  special\r\n\r\nsitting  of  this  House in the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And today, after having listened to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister when he moved the motion standing  in  his\r\n\r\nname,  I  must say that we see nothing of  such  an\r\n\r\nurgent  character  that  this  Assembly  should  be\r\n\r\nsummoned  at  such short notice, thereby  depriving\r\n\r\nthe   Opposition  of  the  time  needed  to  submit\r\n\r\nquestions and motions that we have in mind and plan\r\n\r\nto  do as soon as this Assembly is called for a new\r\n\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is typical of the Prime Minister to spend\r\n\r\nabout  one hour and twenty-two minutes, if  I  have\r\n\r\ngot  it right, telling us sweet nothing, concocting\r\n\r\na  story  that  there  is  a  British  lion  and  a\r\n\r\nCommunist bear, and saying. \"Watch it, boys!  These\r\n\r\ntwo  are  plotting against the P.A.P. and  if  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. were  to fall into the trap,  then  goodbye\r\n\r\nSingapore!  The  P.A.P. is  the  only  saviour  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"  Is it necessary for them  to  cook  up\r\n\r\nsuch  a  story?  Sir, we have  been  alive  to  the\r\n\r\nsituation, and even Members on the other side  must\r\n\r\nhave  been  going round with their  eyes  and  ears\r\n\r\nopen;  and  wherever  we  went  and  if  it  was  a\r\n\r\nBritisher  we  met, he would tell us, \"Please,  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew  deserves  every help.\"  And  even  today\r\n\r\nbefore  we  came, we were told that it would  be  a\r\n\r\ngood  thing if we could support the great Lee  Kuan\r\n\r\nYew.  And  then  we had the British  lion  and  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  bear.  Perhaps,  Sir,  the  great  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has adopted the practice of his Communist\r\n\r\ncomrades whereby it is better for someone to  start\r\n\r\na smear campaign and say. \"Now, even the Communists\r\n\r\nare becoming colonial stooges and therefore we will\r\n\r\nhave  delivered the first blow. The Communists  are\r\n\r\nnow  becoming colonial stooges. We, the P.A.P., are\r\n\r\nanti-colonialists.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they have learned quite a lot during the two\r\n\r\nyears they have been associating with what they now\r\n\r\nterm  the Communist Left. In August last year  when\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister moved a motion on the Yang \r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara's speech, he gave us, for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst  time,  an  indication  of  the  buildup   of\r\n\r\nCommunist forces in Singapore. He said that for the\r\n\r\npast  14  months - that was in August 1960 - Communist\r\n\r\nforces  had  been  building up in the  trade  union\r\n\r\nfield.  He  tried  to frighten  the  Opposition  by\r\n\r\nsaying  that unless we behaved or unless we  worked\r\n\r\nwith   the  P.A.P.,  that  would  be  the  end   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But it was significant,  Sir,  that  he\r\n\r\ndenied what I said to him at that time, that  there\r\n\r\nwere Communist sympathisers, activists or what have\r\n\r\nyou  in  the P.A.P. He stood up and denied  it.  He\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"There  is  no  such  thing.  There  are  no\r\n\r\nCommunist sympathisers and activists in the P.A.P.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  today there is this secret document  which  he\r\n\r\nhas  found it necessary to release saying that  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong  is a Communist-front man!  Sir,  they\r\n\r\nalways say what they mean, and they mean what  they\r\n\r\nsay. Perhaps in this particular instance, what they\r\n\r\nmeant  to say was not what they said to mean.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthey  put  it  to  us whether we wanted  a  general\r\n\r\nelection. We can say to them, we will meet them any\r\n\r\ntime, anywhere. The people of Singapore are fed  up\r\n\r\nwith their mishandling. For the past two years they\r\n\r\nhave  brought nothing but misery to the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Unemployment has increased to  such  an\r\n\r\nextent that it is almost impossible of solution. On\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand,  they have a Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nsaying that we must have industrialisation. We must\r\n\r\nhave  a  development  plan  and  try  our  best  to\r\n\r\nencourage the inflow of foreign capital. But on the\r\n\r\nother hand, there is another Minister who says,  \"I\r\n\r\nwill  use the P.P.S.O. on you if you do not behave.\r\n\r\nI  will see to it that your entry visas will not be\r\n\r\nextended if you do not behave.\" That is the kind of\r\n\r\ngovernment  we have been having for  the  past  two\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I really do not know what they are asking us\r\n\r\nto  vote on. If it is a vote of confidence on  what\r\n\r\nthey  have done about their policies for  the  past\r\n\r\ntwo  years,  I  can say to them,  in  no  uncertain\r\n\r\nterms,   that   we  have  no  confidence   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  If it is to tell us, \"Boys,  there  is\r\n\r\nthis  Communist threat coming, but  you  know  that\r\n\r\nunless we have your\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfidence  we  are  not going to  look  after  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  Singapore,\"  then  say  it  in  plain\r\n\r\nlanguage.  Do  not  use language  that  we  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand. Is the Government prepared to carry  on\r\n\r\nto meet the threat if there is this threat, to look\r\n\r\nafter  the interest of Singapore, to do acts  which\r\n\r\nmay  be  unpalatable,  which may  be  described  as\r\n\r\nundemocratic but doing them as a Government in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the people of Singapore, above  party\r\n\r\npolitics,  above  everything,  guided  by  the  one\r\n\r\ndesire to serve as they have been elected to serve?\r\n\r\nIf  we  heard aright, the Prime Minister said,  \"As\r\n\r\nsoon  as  there  is  this  trouble  coming  up,  we\r\n\r\nabdicate.\"  Sir, what is the use of  our  giving  a\r\n\r\nvote  of confidence to a Government which is  going\r\n\r\nto abdicate immediately there is trouble, and which\r\n\r\nis bringing all this trouble? I said in August 1960\r\n\r\nthat  if they were sincere in their desire to  look\r\n\r\nafter the interest of the people of Singapore, then\r\n\r\nthey should not try to play double politics. To the\r\n\r\nCommunists, they say one thing; to the British they\r\n\r\nsay  another. They denied that there had been  such\r\n\r\nthings.  But  now  it is openly admitted  that  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong and his crowd belong to the  Communist\r\n\r\nLeft.  And  these Communist Left people  have  been\r\n\r\ntold  many a time by the leadership of the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\n\"Boys,  if  you  behave, we  might  see  that  your\r\n\r\ndetainees, your comrades, are released. But if  you\r\n\r\ndo  not  behave, we cannot do it.  If  you  do  not\r\n\r\nbehave, Jamit Singh and company and even I think T.\r\n\r\nT.  Rajah will not be given their citizenship.  But\r\n\r\nif  you behave, we will do it.\" To the British they\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Do  not worry. We are not going  to  release\r\n\r\nthese  people, you know. But allow us  to  use  the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council as a front.\" That is  the\r\n\r\nkind of double talk they have been making. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  thing  that  accounted  for  Lim  Ching  Siong\r\n\r\nstanding  up  on  the  platform  and  accusing  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Prime  Minister. The  Federation  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  - the  Government  of  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya - with  a decisive vote in internal  security,\r\n\r\nfor  the continued detention of the detainees. Sir,\r\n\r\nthey claimed they were a responsible Government. It\r\n\r\nthey  were  a  responsible  Government,  then  they\r\n\r\nshould  accept  full  responsibility  for  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity. Why is it when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey are pressed today we are told that another  18\r\n\r\nwould  be released? Just in order to show  that  if\r\n\r\nthey  really wanted to do it, they could have  done\r\n\r\nit.  Now  they know that when they cannot have  any\r\n\r\nmore  cover,  they say they will  do  it  within  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of time. But before doing that, they cooked\r\n\r\nup  a  story of the British lion and the  Communist\r\n\r\nbear.  I do not know how they cooked up that story.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the Prime Minister, ever since the trouble\r\n\r\nhe  had  last year with his ex-colleague,  the\r\n\r\nex-Minister for National Development, the ex-Mayor  of\r\n\r\nthe  City Council, was a little upset. Every little\r\n\r\nbit   that  he  did  after  that  trouble   was   a\r\n\r\nmiscalculation. They lost in Hong  Lim.  They  said\r\n\r\nthey  were going to resign. They would not  resign.\r\n\r\nThey  said  they were going to resign if they  lost\r\n\r\nAnson. They were asking for our vote of confidence.\r\n\r\nSir, even before Nomination Day on June the 9th.  I\r\n\r\nthink  an hon. Back-bencher of the Government,  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member for Telok Blangah, addressed the Kerala\r\n\r\nAssociation  and  said, as a Back-bencher,  \"If  we\r\n\r\nlose in Anson, the Government will resign.\" A\r\n\r\nBack-bencher speaking on behalf of the Government! There\r\n\r\nwas  no contradiction. The Government did not issue\r\n\r\nany  statement  to contradict that. The  Government\r\n\r\nallowed  it to go through. The Government  lost  in\r\n\r\nAnson   and  it  is  now  asking  for  a  vote   of\r\n\r\nconfidence.  And it was a Back-bencher,  their  own\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary, who said today  that  this\r\n\r\nvote  of  confidence is nothing but party politics.\r\n\r\nAnd  we are asked to come here to help them out  of\r\n\r\ntheir  difficulty inside the Party. Why should  we?\r\n\r\nIf  that is the intention, we can say this to  them\r\n\r\nhere, we are going to vote against the motion.  But\r\n\r\nif it is the intention of the Government to ask for\r\n\r\na  vote of confidence to strengthen their stand  in\r\n\r\norder  to  discharge their duty to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  so far as security and  welfare  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  then  we will give them  that  vote  of\r\n\r\nconfidence. But they must assure us in no uncertain\r\n\r\nterms  that that is the intention. If there is  any\r\n\r\nother intention, then the vote is no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They now find that the three Political Secretaries\r\n\r\nstabbed them in the back. But in August 1960 1 told\r\n\r\nthem - I do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  to  quote  because it is rather  long - I  told\r\n\r\nthem: \"I call upon them that if they really want to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  threat which the Prime Minister  himself\r\n\r\nhas stated in no uncertain terms, they must be firm\r\n\r\nand  get rid of the Political Secretaries whom they\r\n\r\nhave  found  to  be disloyal.\" The  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nlaughed  at  me.  He used language which  could  be\r\n\r\nboiled  down  to  mean,  \"You  are  teaching   your\r\n\r\ngrandmother  to suck eggs.\" And then  I  told  them\r\n\r\nthat  if  they  wanted to continue  and  meet  this\r\n\r\nthreat  and  get the support of each and  everyone,\r\n\r\nnot  only in the Assembly but in the country,  they\r\n\r\nmust  forget their arrogance. Learn to  be  humble,\r\n\r\nbecause  there  is  greatness in  humility  and  no\r\n\r\ngreatness  in  greatness  itself.  He  laughed.  He\r\n\r\njeered.  Today  they come for a  vote,  asking  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to  vote with them.  Even  their\r\n\r\nBack-benchers  say  it is laughable for the  Government,\r\n\r\nwith 39 seats, having to call on the assistance  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition to see that they remain  in  power.\r\n\r\nThey  say that these Political Secretaries  stabbed\r\n\r\nthem in the back. But they have not told us whether\r\n\r\nthese Political Secretaries have been sacked.  They\r\n\r\nare  still being paid. Until they have been sacked,\r\n\r\nthey  are  still being paid $1,100 a month  out  of\r\n\r\npublic  funds.  And  yet they are  a  good,  clean,\r\n\r\nhonest  government, making use of public  funds  to\r\n\r\npay traitors, according to them. Is it right? Is it\r\n\r\ngood, clean, honest that they should keep on paying\r\n\r\n$1,100  a  month  to  each of the  three  Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries  whom  they  now  describe  as   having\r\n\r\nstabbed  them in the back? Of course, there  are  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  other things that have been going on.  Now\r\n\r\nsince  it  is  clear  from  the  speeches  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Back-benchers that this vote  that  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister is moving is nothing but an attempt\r\n\r\nby the Government to get the Opposition involved in\r\n\r\ntheir  party  politics, I  do  not  think  we  need\r\n\r\nprolong this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is something to which I must reply. Sir.\r\n\r\nThe hon. Member for Anson who has been away for the\r\n\r\npast  five  years has come back to us. I extend  to\r\n\r\nhim  a very warm welcome. But it would appear, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat he comes back to us still with a fixation that\r\n\r\nwe   let  Singapore  down.  Still  criticising  the\r\n\r\nConstitution, saying how bad it was. It would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave been better if he had got it. There had been a\r\n\r\nvery lengthy debate at that time, Sir, I would  not\r\n\r\nlike  to waste the time of this Assembly, but I  do\r\n\r\nsay   this,  and  I  repeat  it.  That   what   was\r\n\r\nbrought back from London was just accepting what he\r\n\r\nhad accepted, and succeeding where he had failed in\r\n\r\ngetting a Malayan-born representative of the Queen,\r\n\r\nin  getting  a  representative  of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment to participate in this Internal Security\r\n\r\nCouncil. There was another thing he had in mind. He\r\n\r\nwas  prepared  to  accept a  Defence  and  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil under the Constitution offered to him  with\r\n\r\nthe  British  as  Chairman, and  this  Defence  and\r\n\r\nSecurity Council would have a right to regulate the\r\n\r\ninternal   security  of  Singapore  by \r\n\r\nOrders-in-Council.  Let  me not fall into the  habit  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson who would, on every occasion, like\r\n\r\nto  say everything he can about me. So let us leave\r\n\r\nit   at   that.  Let  us  not  see  an   Opposition\r\n\r\nquarrelling with the Opposition when the government\r\n\r\nof  the day is just waiting for a decision from the\r\n\r\nOpposition  whether  they should  continue  or  not\r\n\r\ncontinue  in  office. We say this in  no  uncertain\r\n\r\nterms. That if it is a vote for them to take action\r\n\r\nagainst their own Party members, then it is nothing\r\n\r\nbut  party  politics, and we will vote against  it.\r\n\r\nBut  if it is for the security of the country,  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister will have to stand up and show us in\r\n\r\nno  uncertain terms that that is what he intends to\r\n\r\ndo - that he intends to serve the people and  to  run\r\n\r\nthe  Government in the best interest of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, irrespective of any action which  he\r\n\r\nmay  be forced to take against his comrades and\r\n\r\nex-comrades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point that was brought up in the\r\n\r\ndebate  just now, Sir, that Lim Ching Siong  was  a\r\n\r\ngreat  man and that it was a very cruel act on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the previous Government to have  arrested\r\n\r\nhim.  Let me remind this House that Lim Ching Siong\r\n\r\nwas  arrested on the premises of the Singapore Shop\r\n\r\nand  Factory Workers Union which was the centre  of\r\n\r\nthe  riot  disturbance. There  were  knives,  brass\r\n\r\nbars,  iron  bars,  wooden bars, acid  bottles  and\r\n\r\nCommunist literature, the full plan of campaign  of\r\n\r\nhow to overthrow the Government,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere.

The Party of the Member opposite is said\r\n\r\nto be a \"rojak party\". He claimed his Party to be a\r\n\r\nLeftist  Party.  At that time the people  supported\r\n\r\nhim  to  become the first government.  He  used  to\r\n\r\npretend  to  be progressive and then  arrested  the\r\n\r\nunionists. When he saw our motion here he was  very\r\n\r\nglad  to  stand up and say that if this motion  was\r\n\r\nfor  the security of the people of Singapore,  then\r\n\r\nhe would vote for it. Mr Speaker, here I will take\r\n\r\npart   in  discussing  this  matter.  It  is   very\r\n\r\nregretful for me to say this - the Government has  39\r\n\r\nMembers and the Opposition has only 12 Members.  So\r\n\r\nwith  12 Members how can they vote against  the  39\r\n\r\nMembers?  How can they compete with us 39  Members?\r\n\r\nIt  is  unwise  for  them to do so.  Therefore,  by\r\n\r\nmoving  this  motion, our Prime  Minister  is  very\r\n\r\nchildish and puerile. It would be better for us  to\r\n\r\ntake  this  motion to the 51 Branches of the  Party\r\n\r\nand  also  to  the Central Executive Committee  and\r\n\r\nalso  the  paid officials of the Party in order  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  it.  We can discuss the wrong attitude  of\r\n\r\nthe  leadership.  Our Party prestige  and  position\r\n\r\nwill then be restored. Then we can pursue our\r\n\r\nanti-colonialist struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  Sir,  the  eight  Assemblymen  have\r\n\r\njointly  written  a letter to the  Party  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  asking them to convene a  joint  session\r\n\r\nbetween the Central Executive Committee and the  51\r\n\r\nBranches. In their reply, they said this  could  be\r\n\r\ndone  later  on.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Party\r\n\r\nleadership  sent one of their agents to the  forum.\r\n\r\nFrom  this,  it  can be proved  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\ndemocracy  in  the  Party. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nmotion  introduced  by the Prime Minister  concerns\r\n\r\nintra-party  affairs.  On  14th  July,  the   eight\r\n\r\nAssemblymen published their letter to the  Chairman\r\n\r\nin  the newspapers. We clearly pointed out the lack\r\n\r\nof  democracy  and  the anti-people  trend  in  the\r\n\r\nParty.  In  the  Hong  Lim  by-election  our  Party\r\n\r\nsuffered a great loss. This clearly shows that  the\r\n\r\npolicy  adopted  by the leadership is  against  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people. The present leadership  in\r\n\r\nthe  Party  cannot  reflect the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Now,  all  the  people  of  Singapore  are\r\n\r\ndissatisfied with the P.A.P. and Party members have\r\n\r\nalso   lost  confidence  in  the  leadership.

Our\r\n\r\nleaders always like to give a red cap to anyone who\r\n\r\ndoes  not agree with the Party leadership, the \r\n\r\nso-called  \"pro-Communist Left-wing\" and other  terms.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, why do some of the  Assemblymen\r\n\r\nrebel against the leadership?

My\r\n\r\nopinion  is  the  same as that  expressed  by  some\r\n\r\nmembers in the Party. Though the opinion may be the\r\n\r\nsame,  I  think it is better to repeat  it  because\r\n\r\nthis  is  not an unimportant thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would\r\n\r\nlike to refer to what the Member for Cairnhill  has\r\n\r\nsaid.

But  his  position  now  is\r\n\r\nentirely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\ndifferent. The situation today is that the minority\r\n\r\nleadership in the Party has introduced this motion.\r\n\r\nI  have nothing much to say except that we are very\r\n\r\ndisheartened at it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I really feel very uncomfortable\r\n\r\nand  I  do not understand. The Government is  in  a\r\n\r\nquandary,  surrounded  on  and  attacked  from  all\r\n\r\nsides.  This situation should not have arisen.  The\r\n\r\nintroduction of the motion of the Prime Minister is\r\n\r\na  wrong move, judging it from any angle. It should\r\n\r\nhave been thrashed out in the Party itself. It  has\r\n\r\nnot received the support of the Party at all. If it\r\n\r\nhad  been agreed to by all the Party members,  then\r\n\r\nonly  would it have been right to introduce it into\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly. But, in fact, the Prime Minister did\r\n\r\nnot  seek any discussion on this motion. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe   introduction  of  this  motion   is   clearly\r\n\r\nsomething  which  has  been  manipulated   by   the\r\n\r\nminority leadership. This is improper. The division\r\n\r\nin the ranks of our Party shows that the leadership\r\n\r\nwas lacking in democracy for not having convened  a\r\n\r\nmeeting of the 51 P.A.P. Branches to discuss  party\r\n\r\nproblems  and matters. The leadership did not  dare\r\n\r\nto  accede  to  the request of the members  of  the\r\n\r\nParty,  but they saw fit to introduce party  issues\r\n\r\ninto the Assembly. This kind of political tactic is\r\n\r\nadopted  in order to confuse the people.  Everybody\r\n\r\nclearly  knows that our Party has 39 seats  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  and there has never been an occasion  for\r\n\r\nany  Member  on this side or on that  side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse   to  criticise  this  fact.  Why  does   the\r\n\r\nleadership  try to introduce a motion of confidence\r\n\r\nin  the  Government? This shows that they  have  no\r\n\r\ntrust in us. They are afraid to discuss this matter\r\n\r\nin the Party itself, perhaps because they fear that\r\n\r\nthey  might not get the support of their  comrades.\r\n\r\nBut then without this support, they should not have\r\n\r\nintroduced this motion here. They want us to follow\r\n\r\nthem blindly. Therefore, they have resorted to  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  this  Assembly in order to  achieve  their\r\n\r\nobjective. I think that any recourse to the use  of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly as a means of carrying out any measure\r\n\r\ndetrimental  to  the  people will  be  against  the\r\n\r\nconscience of the Government. I believe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the  people  of  Singapore,  who  are   very\r\n\r\npolitically  conscious, will not be  confused  over\r\n\r\nthis issue and that they will stand up to claim the\r\n\r\nfruits which they have obtained after so many years\r\n\r\nof struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dispute is an intra-party issue, whether the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  going  to follow the people's  line  in\r\n\r\ncontinuing  the anti-colonial struggle.  It  is  an\r\n\r\nissue  concerning a basic political principle.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has to face this political reality in  order\r\n\r\nto  win the trust and confidence of the whole Party\r\n\r\nand  the people. It is not right and proper to take\r\n\r\na  strong line to suppress the democratic rights of\r\n\r\nthe people by resorting to the introduction of this\r\n\r\nmotion  here to get a confidence vote  on  it.  The\r\n\r\nleadership should have got the issue settled in the\r\n\r\nParty  itself. We joined the P.A.P. and our efforts\r\n\r\nhave helped to build it up. Without our support and\r\n\r\nour  efforts, the Party could not have become  what\r\n\r\nit  is  today.  But now the minority leadership  is\r\n\r\ncontrolling  the Party in every way.

By trying to  destroy  the\r\n\r\nParty  which  has so far supported them,  they  are\r\n\r\ntrying   to  destroy  themselves.  They   have   no\r\n\r\nfollowing  of  their own. They think the  Party  is\r\n\r\ngoing  down.  So  they allow themselves  to  become\r\n\r\nprisoners  of anti-P.A.P. forces led by  Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong and his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Member for Anson, who thinks he is free,\r\n\r\nis  in  fact  a  prisoner of the  same  anti-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nforces.  Today I heard him in this House  defending\r\n\r\nLim  Ching Siong, Fong Swee Suan and their friends.\r\n\r\nThese  were the same people whom he once  condemned\r\n\r\nin the same House as dangerous subversives.

But here I would like to express my opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight Assemblymen have presented our views to\r\n\r\nthe Central Executive Committee, and they show that\r\n\r\nour   stand  is  similar  to  the  P.A.P.'s  stand.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are fully convinced that we  are  not\r\n\r\nagainst  our Party's policy. And so their criticism\r\n\r\nthat we are attacking the Party is groundless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Prime Minister has moved this motion today for\r\n\r\ndiscussion. The reason for it has been expressed by\r\n\r\nour  colleagues.  The motive of the  motion  is  to\r\n\r\nresolve the differences about the lack of democracy\r\n\r\nin  our  Party. The introduction of the motion  was\r\n\r\ndue to the intra-party struggle because of lack  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, today we discuss the question whether we have confidence in the Government. Some Members\r\n\r\non  the  Opposition  who have already  spoken  have\r\n\r\nattacked  the P.A.P. Government. People  may  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  the representatives of the people  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   side  are  right  in   attacking   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  have said, as the Opposition  have\r\n\r\nalso  said, that this is wrong and that  is  wrong.\r\n\r\nBut  we  differ from the reactionary Right in  that\r\n\r\nwe,  as  representatives of the  people,  are  also\r\n\r\nmembers of the P.A.P. What we say today is said  as\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the P.A.P. and not as Members  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  still  less  as  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition. We hope that the people will not forget\r\n\r\nthis,  as  otherwise they will not  understand  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of our speeches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been said by other Members, it is improper\r\n\r\nto bring this motion to the House today, because it\r\n\r\nconcerns our Party's struggle. There is no need  to\r\n\r\ncall   on  the  Opposition  Members  to  interfere.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the motion has been brought  from  within\r\n\r\nthe  Party  to the Assembly, we as Members  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly have to join issue with the Government and\r\n\r\nthe  party leadership. From our point of view, this\r\n\r\nis in accordance with the interests of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, first, I want to ask what is meant by \"confidence in the Government\"? Does it mean that\r\n\r\nit   is  sufficient  for  a  few  people  to   have\r\n\r\nconfidence in the Government? We deny this. We were\r\n\r\nelected by the people, and we do not want to  cheat\r\n\r\nothers, nor do we want to cheat ourselves. Even  if\r\n\r\nthe  Members  give  the  Government  100  per  cent\r\n\r\nconfidence, that does not reflect confidence in the\r\n\r\nParty and in the leadership. If we get 100 per cent\r\n\r\nconfidence, if we repeat past errors and go against\r\n\r\nthe accepted principles, then the people will still\r\n\r\nbe  dissatisfied  with us and we might  lose  their\r\n\r\nconfidence.  This is very clear even to  a  boy  of\r\n\r\nthree  years, and more so to the leadership of  the\r\n\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the big question is: why do they file this\r\n\r\nmotion before the House? We have lost the Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nand  Anson by-elections, and with the loss  of  two\r\n\r\nseats, the  P.A.P. has 39 seats, but still  has  a\r\n\r\nmajority.  I say that there is no real  problem  of\r\n\r\nconfidence or non-confidence in the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I should now explain the causes that have led to the differences in the Party. The\r\n\r\nOpposition  said  that  this  was  caused  by   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  in  the Party. It is not surprising  at\r\n\r\nall.  What  is surprising is, today, even  the \r\n\r\nso-called  progressive leadership also admit  it.  All\r\n\r\nthe problems facing the Party are blamed on Mr Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong. Mr Lim Ching Siong is a great  trade\r\n\r\nunionist and a leader of the workers, but he is not\r\n\r\na  demi-god. Alone, he cannot have the force or the\r\n\r\npower  to  disrupt the Party. But  this  great  man\r\n\r\n(Mr, Lee Kuan Yew) said that we are controlled  by\r\n\r\nMr  Lim Ching Siong. We are reasonable men and  we\r\n\r\ncan  reason  for ourselves and think for ourselves.\r\n\r\nLet  all  the  people  be  careful  and  think  for\r\n\r\nthemselves:  why  is  the Government  attacked  all\r\n\r\nround? Why is it that so many party cadres and  the\r\n\r\nthousands  of P.A.P. members believe  that  as  the\r\n\r\nleaders have come into power and have assumed  very\r\n\r\nhigh  offices, they have changed? But  today,  they\r\n\r\nhave  resorted  to  mean  tactics,  equivalent   to\r\n\r\nbribery,  in  order  to retain  leadership  in  the\r\n\r\nParty.  But  we want to tell them that the  \r\n\r\nbuying-over   of   people  with  money  is  not  permitted\r\n\r\naccording to political principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me say why the Party leadership has fallen into the pit. It is because they have\r\n\r\nturned  Right. This is the main issue in our Party.\r\n\r\nTheir  stand now is different from that of  before.\r\n\r\nWe  have  been associating with them  for  so  many\r\n\r\nyears,  and  we  understand fully  their  political\r\n\r\nmotives.  Therefore, what we say is not groundless.\r\n\r\nIn  1959  because the people of Singapore wanted  a\r\n\r\nprogressive Left-wing Government, they elected  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. into  power. All those members  and  cadres\r\n\r\nloyal to the Party had accepted the trust that  the\r\n\r\npeople  should  not  be disappointed  and  that  we\r\n\r\nshould bear our responsibility. Therefore, they had\r\n\r\nfought    against   Right-wingers    and    against\r\n\r\ncolonialists,  and they had made great  sacrifices.\r\n\r\nBut  today  all classes of the people in  Singapore\r\n\r\nare generally dissatisfied with the leadership,  as\r\n\r\nare  also our Party cadres and members. That is why\r\n\r\nwe must openly give here our views, and I hope you.\r\n\r\nMr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  will allow us some more time  to  discuss\r\n\r\nthis  issue because the motion raised today is very\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As loyal members we have to declare our stand. We\r\n\r\nall know the attitude of our leadership towards the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  the different communities  and  their\r\n\r\nstand. Anyone with brains will understand that  all\r\n\r\nraces  have to live in harmony. All the races  here\r\n\r\nhave  accepted it as a fact and they have lived  in\r\n\r\nharmony  all  along,  and yet  the  action  of  the\r\n\r\nleadership  is  not conducive to  that.  They  have\r\n\r\nrepeatedly cried out slogans about the unity of the\r\n\r\ndifferent  races, hut  they  have  in  fact   been\r\n\r\nresorting only to slogans like \"super-Malaya\", and\r\n\r\nso   on.   On  the  other  hand,  they  resort   to\r\n\r\nsuppressing the people who do not agree with  them.\r\n\r\nand  now  they  have suddenly raised the  issue  of\r\n\r\nmerger.  This is not without any motive.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  Government  and  the  Malays  have\r\n\r\nincreased their suspicion in regard to the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity in Singapore. The leadership cannot evade\r\n\r\nthis responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general members in the Party have been excited\r\n\r\nand  unduly stirred because some of them have  been\r\n\r\nnamed  as  Leftist elements. They  think  that  the\r\n\r\nLeftists  are fundamentally opposed to merger,  but\r\n\r\nhope  that  merger can take place immediately.  But\r\n\r\nthey find that their interpretation has been proved\r\n\r\nto  be  wrong.  We  know that the  purpose  of  the\r\n\r\nleadership is to use the issue of merger to  defeat\r\n\r\nall   Left-wingers  in  order  to  maintain   their\r\n\r\npolitical  power.  But this  act  of  resorting  to\r\n\r\npolitical  power  by suppressing the  Left-wing  is\r\n\r\nsomething that we cannot accept. This will one  day\r\n\r\nlead  to  some trouble. By then it is too late  to\r\n\r\nregret.  As a progressive Left-wing Party, we  have\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  There is great  significance  in\r\n\r\nLeft-wing  unity and unity in the  Party,  but  the\r\n\r\ndivision in the Left-wing Party has been made clear\r\n\r\nonly  recently. When we Left-wing people enter into\r\n\r\na  new  era, we have to unite together to  progress\r\n\r\ntowards  the  right  path.  Some  people  who  feel\r\n\r\njustified in our policies have gone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  campaigning for the Party in order  to  obtain\r\n\r\nsecurity  for  the Party. But when the  by-election\r\n\r\nwas  lost, they put the responsibility on the other\r\n\r\npeople.  Others  were  to  be  blamed.  They   were\r\n\r\ninnocent. This attitude of not wanting to unite all\r\n\r\nthe  Left-wing forces has been known to us. But  we\r\n\r\nhave  under-rated their hypocrisy.  Now  they  have\r\n\r\nopenly  split the trade union movement. At present,\r\n\r\nthe  leadership's  great  enemy  is  the  Left-wing\r\n\r\nforces. Those Right-wingers are their friends. They\r\n\r\ncan  unite  with them. When they talk  of  the \r\n\r\nso-called  non-Communist Left and the Communist  Left,\r\n\r\nthey are merely playing political tricks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in words and deeds our leadership in the Party are very similar to those of Lim Yew\r\n\r\nHock.  There  are a lot of facts to be  enumerated.\r\n\r\nNow  I  will  quote only a few facts to  show  you.\r\n\r\nFirst,  in  the  Anson  by-election,  the  Alliance\r\n\r\ncandidate  had  no difference of opinion  with  our\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance. It is a matter  of  being  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  Party only. This fact has been  revealed\r\n\r\nat  the forum held at the University of Malaya when\r\n\r\nour P.A.P. representative and the representative of\r\n\r\nthe  Alliance were very similar in the  content  of\r\n\r\ntheir speeches. This is an unusual coincidence. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the people are not forgetful, and  we  can\r\n\r\nremember  that  Lim  Yew Hock has  a  very  similar\r\n\r\nspeech. They knew only-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member knows\r\n\r\nthe Standing Order. It says he must not refer to  a\r\n\r\nMember of this Assembly by name. He should refer to\r\n\r\nhim by his constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): They ask,\r\n\r\nwithout the base, what are we going to do? They say\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  100  per cent of the  interests  are\r\n\r\ndependent  on  the  British forces.  Therefore,  in\r\n\r\ntheir  conclusion, they say we must not  chase  out\r\n\r\nthe  British. We must not be anti-colonialist. This\r\n\r\nhas  greatly  disappointed  us.  Mr  Speaker,   we\r\n\r\nclearly  understand  that  the  attitude   of   the\r\n\r\nleadership in the P.A.P. and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat of the leadership of the Alliance towards  the\r\n\r\npeople  is  the  same.  And the  people  have  lost\r\n\r\nconfidence in their attitude. The leadership  think\r\n\r\nthat  the  people are easily led into believing  in\r\n\r\nCommunism. They intend not to take the people  into\r\n\r\ntheir  confidence. For the past two years  we  have\r\n\r\nseen  that the P.A.P. leadership actually like  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of the Alliance. They consider that  half\r\n\r\nof  the  people are foolish. After their defeat  in\r\n\r\nthe Hong Lim by-election, they blame the voters for\r\n\r\nnot returning them to power. Therefore, they cannot\r\n\r\nhave close association with the people. They cannot\r\n\r\nmix   with  the  people.  Since  the  people   have\r\n\r\nunderstood their aspirations, we have expressed our\r\n\r\ndifferent points of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to tell you that the P.A.P. does not belong to the leadership. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. belongs to all the comrades and members  and\r\n\r\nexecutives.  It  has been created by  the  combined\r\n\r\nefforts of the rank and file. In the year 1959, the\r\n\r\npeople  had great confidence in our Party.  Because\r\n\r\nof  that,  we  won  43 seats. In the  eyes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  the  Party  has  enjoyed  great  prestige.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the short period of two years, we\r\n\r\nhave  today fallen into this position. It  is  very\r\n\r\nsad  indeed.  The leadership have called  upon  the\r\n\r\npeople, through the Members of this House, to  have\r\n\r\nconfidence in them. This is not a joke. It is  verb\r\n\r\nserious.  Politics is very important. It is  not  a\r\n\r\njoke.  Because it greatly influences the  lives  of\r\n\r\nthe  people. Therefore, with great confidence  they\r\n\r\nsay  they  will not assume power unless the  people\r\n\r\nhave  confidence in them. They have threatened that\r\n\r\ntrouble may begin. At this time they still call  on\r\n\r\nthe people to have confidence in them. We hope that\r\n\r\nthis  is  not a joke. Mr Speaker, I hope you  will\r\n\r\npay attention to the fact that intra-party troubles\r\n\r\nshould  be resolved by ourselves. If the leadership\r\n\r\nintend  to  carry out the policies and reflect  the\r\n\r\nattitude of the Party, then let them quickly summon\r\n\r\nall  the  51 branches for a Party meeting. We  hope\r\n\r\nthen  that  this  trouble will be resolved  in  our\r\n\r\nParty and not in the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>9.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, today if is with a heavy and sad\r\n\r\nheart  that  I  speak. Today when  I  entered  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  I see a political waverer, one who  wants\r\n\r\nto  hand  over  Singapore  to  the  United  Nations\r\n\r\nOrganisation.  It is with a sad heart  that  I  say\r\n\r\nthis.  Because  the  President of  the  T.U.C. was\r\n\r\ndefeated  by him. And this defeat is one which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  brought  about by members of  our  Party  who\r\n\r\nstabbed us in the back. That is why we suffered the\r\n\r\ndefeat. If we look at the history of the P.A.P. and\r\n\r\ncompare it with the history of this candidate, then\r\n\r\nthe  one  who should have entered this House  today\r\n\r\nshould  not  be the one who has been sworn  in.  He\r\n\r\nshould  be  one  who works for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers,   who  struggles  for  the   workers   and\r\n\r\nrepresents them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now we have heard our own\r\n\r\ncomrades  in the Party speak. They say there  is  a\r\n\r\nlack of democracy in the Party. They criticise  and\r\n\r\nattack  the Party leadership. I am a member of  the\r\n\r\nCentral Executive Committee of the P.A.P. And I say\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore  will  know  the  truth.\r\n\r\nFrankly  speaking, the People's  Action  Party  may\r\n\r\nhave  made  some  errors in their  policy,  but  in\r\n\r\nprinciple they have made no errors. If it  is  said\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  no democracy in the  Party,  then,\r\n\r\nafter  the defeat of the Hong Lim by-election,  why\r\n\r\ndid  we hold a joint meeting to review the work  of\r\n\r\nthe Party?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, every Member of the Assembly has\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  to raise questions.  Among  these\r\n\r\nMembers, some were elected into the Committee.  Two\r\n\r\nwere  elected  as  members of the Committee.  Every\r\n\r\nBranch of the Party has had the opportunity to give\r\n\r\ntheir  views  as regards policy to the  leadership.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, can you say there is no democracy\r\n\r\nin  the Party? Today I see our own comrades holding\r\n\r\na sharp knife and stabbing their own comrades. This\r\n\r\nmakes me feel very sad indeed. One of us scolds the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  been  chosen by  us.  He  represents\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  Prime Minister is at  present  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  They  have  insulted  him.  I  believe  our\r\n\r\nMembers  will  feel very sad to see  in  tomorrow's\r\n\r\npapers  that  one of our comrades has  scolded  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General,  and  used  very  bad  words  to\r\n\r\ndescribe him. But the principles of the Party  have\r\n\r\nnot  changed  at  all.  At  every  sitting  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  there has been no one to  criticise  the\r\n\r\npolicies  of the Party. But today, there  has  been\r\n\r\ntalk  that  the Party has changed. If that  is  so,\r\n\r\nthen everyone of them should be responsible for it.\r\n\r\nWhy  did they not bring this matter up in the past?\r\n\r\nWhy  did  they  not criticise the  Party  at  Party\r\n\r\nmeetings? Sometimes when I criticised some matters,\r\n\r\nthese people scorned me. I remember on one occasion\r\n\r\nwhen the Party has just been in the government  for\r\n\r\nsometime,  I  attacked one Government  servant - that\r\n\r\nwas  Thomson - but everyone of them scorned me  then.\r\n\r\nWhy?  The P.A.P. at that time was very stable. They\r\n\r\ncould  not argue over small mistakes. I cannot  pay\r\n\r\nrespect to that kind of hero. Party matters  should\r\n\r\nbe resolved within the Party. Why should they bring\r\n\r\nup  this matter during the course of the Anson \r\n\r\nby-election?  No  one can tolerate this stabbing  from\r\n\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now I heard an S.P.A.\r\n\r\nMember of the Opposition, the Member for Cairnhill,\r\n\r\ncriticising  the  Government  and  saying  that  we\r\n\r\nshould admit to something before they could support\r\n\r\nus.  This S.P.A. Member should not imagine that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., in the course of its struggle over a period\r\n\r\nof  six  years, could be induced to go over to  the\r\n\r\nother side. On this side, I must emphasise that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will  not  be  like  the  Lim   Yew   Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government   used\r\n\r\ncertain  tactics  to  deal  with  people.  We,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., want to debate the question of the one  man\r\n\r\none  vote system and to get the confidence  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  by  this way. We will never resort  to  his\r\n\r\nmethods.  Some  comrades  have  said  that  we  are\r\n\r\nadopting  means to deal with them. What  they  have\r\n\r\nsaid  is  wrong. We know some tricks to  deal  with\r\n\r\nthem.  Coming  to a collusion with the  Right  will\r\n\r\nnever  happen.  This  talk is unnecessary  and  the\r\n\r\ndoubt is unfounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at present our main enemy is\r\n\r\nstill  around.  All we want to achieve  now  is  to\r\n\r\ndefeat  British  colonialism. We  should  be  \r\n\r\nanti-rightist. Therefore, they think that by firing  off\r\n\r\nsome   falsehoods,  in  the  words  of  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  they  will succeed; but in  future,  the\r\n\r\ntruth will be out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, one of us did not understand\r\n\r\nsome  questions concerning the Party and had become\r\n\r\nsceptical and had even accused the Party. So I want\r\n\r\nto   explain  to  him  because  maybe  he  did  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  the policy because he has been  in  the\r\n\r\nParty  for  just a short time. I want to  tell  him\r\n\r\nthis  that the cadres of the Party are selected  by\r\n\r\nthe  various  Branches  of  the  Party.  He  should\r\n\r\nremember  this.  The  Central  Executive  Committee\r\n\r\nselects  the cadres. This selection is  decided  on\r\n\r\nthe performance and work of the member of the Party\r\n\r\nconcerned. So I would like to tell this member  who\r\n\r\ndoes not understand, not to magnify a small matter,\r\n\r\nto insult and smear our own Members or comrades. We\r\n\r\nshould  unite  together and should  not  shirk  our\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. We should carry out the  people's\r\n\r\nmission and should not disappoint them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>9.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, originally I\r\n\r\nfound  it  hard  to believe that tonight's  special\r\n\r\nsession would develop into what it is now.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  in  a  dream world. But  after  having\r\n\r\nfollowed with great interest the speeches  made  by\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this House, I find it  imperative,  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Alliance, in particular U.M.N.O.,  to\r\n\r\nexpress my views on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political developments in Singapore to date\r\n\r\nhave  only  reached the status of  self-government.\r\n\r\nOur aim to liberate the island of Singapore in this\r\n\r\nkind   of  atmosphere  will  be  even  farther   of\r\n\r\nachievement. Who will laugh at us after seeing  the\r\n\r\nevents happening in this Assembly? Nobody else  but\r\n\r\nthe British colonialists. Mr Speaker, since\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  beginning,  we  have  not  deviated  from  our\r\n\r\nattitude towards this Government which has  claimed\r\n\r\nto have the overwhelming support of the people, the\r\n\r\nloyalty  of  whose  membership  is  unquestionable:\r\n\r\nwhose policy is acceptable to the people, and whose\r\n\r\nleadership  is approved by the people. But  as  has\r\n\r\nbeen   demonstrated   to  them,   our   suspicions,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those  of  U.M.N.O.,  have  now  been\r\n\r\nconfirmed. All kinds of abuses were heaped  on  the\r\n\r\nOpposition   side  (which  originally   had   eight\r\n\r\nMembers)  with  no  sense of decency,  although  we\r\n\r\nrepresent certain sections of the people.  We  were\r\n\r\naccused of being the tools of colonialism. But  now\r\n\r\nit is our turn to accuse them of being the tools of\r\n\r\ncertain  forces which want to grab power for  their\r\n\r\nown ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think there is no need for me to recapitulate matters to which we had drawn\r\n\r\nGovernment's attention. It can be said that what we\r\n\r\nhave  said has fallen on deaf ears. It is as though\r\n\r\nwe  are  speaking  to a deaf person.  We  know  the\r\n\r\ntactics of the Communists. In our opinion, we  will\r\n\r\nnot compromise if necessary with the Communists. If\r\n\r\nthey  want to use violence, we will meet them  with\r\n\r\nviolence.  That  is  the stand  of  U.M.N.O. which\r\n\r\nrepresents  the Malay section of the  community  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   They   have   been   recognised    and\r\n\r\nacknowledged  in the Preamble [of the Constitution]\r\n\r\nas  the  indigenous people of Singapore. Our  stand\r\n\r\ndoes  not centre around ideologies. To us, it is  a\r\n\r\nsmall   matter   and  we  should  not   engage   in\r\n\r\nunnecessary   arguments  over  it.   However,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or the P.A.P. have boasted  that  their\r\n\r\nideology  brings  not disunity  but  unity  to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. I repeat what we have said  in\r\n\r\nour  constructive criticisms in the past.  We  have\r\n\r\nsaid  that the tiger which they bring up  will  one\r\n\r\nday  devour them. There is no doubt about it.  They\r\n\r\nrealise  now  that  they are in pain.  The  problem\r\n\r\nconfronting us now, Mr Speaker, I agree,  concerns\r\n\r\nall  the  people of Singapore, although  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain  quarters which maintain  that  it  has  no\r\n\r\nconnection with the people and that it is an\r\n\r\nintra-party  struggle. If the Party in power is facing  a\r\n\r\ncrisis, will that mean that there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis to be no association between them and the people\r\n\r\nwho  voted  them  into  power?  These  double-faced\r\n\r\ntactics of the Government - like a double-edged saw - I\r\n\r\nsay,  are  deluding the people.  There  can  be  no\r\n\r\ncompromise on this issue. The damage created by the\r\n\r\nGovernment   should  be  solely   blamed   on   the\r\n\r\ngovernment in power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I must declare my stand on this\r\n\r\nmotion,  otherwise I can hardly face the people  in\r\n\r\nmy   constituency.  The  purpose   of   the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  motion today is to force  us  to  break\r\n\r\naway  from him. Let me point out the motive  behind\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister's motion. In short, the  Party\r\n\r\nleadership  wish  to  obtain  greater   power   for\r\n\r\nthemselves. Let me quote a passage from  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In order to maintain peace and order in the\r\n\r\ncountry  the  Government, on behalf of the  people,\r\n\r\nhas  to  resort  to  some  unpleasant  and  awkward\r\n\r\nactions. I do not wish to assume responsibility  in\r\n\r\nthis respect.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>From  this, it can be clearly seen what his motive\r\n\r\nis.  I think everybody can still remember very well\r\n\r\nthe  former Chief Minister. Tun Lim Yew Hock,  when\r\n\r\nhe  challenged  the people by using words  in  like\r\n\r\nvein.  But I would like to point out that  we  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  confused and coerced by these  adventurers\r\n\r\nthrough  intimidation to follow the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nto  death. We will not be forced into it.  I  think\r\n\r\none  can  judge fairly by wisely reasoning out  the\r\n\r\nGovernment leadership's attitude and the statements\r\n\r\nissued  on behalf of the Party during the past  few\r\n\r\nyears.  The  Prime Minister has brought  an  \r\n\r\nintra-party  issue into this Assembly. It is not logical.\r\n\r\nThe  Prime  Minister wants to have a vote  on  this\r\n\r\nmotion, and this cannot be other than a trap. If it\r\n\r\nis a trap, then I have to expose it, but I will not\r\n\r\nfall into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody can remember that after the defeat of\r\n\r\nthe  Party in the Hong Lim by-election, some of the\r\n\r\nleaders  in our Party did not want to take heed  of\r\n\r\nthe  experiences and lessons gained from the defeat\r\n\r\nand admit their errors. They did\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  intend to abandon their leadership. But  after\r\n\r\npublic opinion as reflected in newspaper editorials\r\n\r\nwas  expressed and, the stand taken  by  our  Party\r\n\r\nmembers  was  discussed, they came to  admit  their\r\n\r\nerrors.   Therefore,  the  question   whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment should resign or not was postponed  till\r\n\r\nafter   the  Anson  by-election.  But  then   these\r\n\r\ncircumstances  brought about  a  dissident  feeling\r\n\r\namongst the general members. Now that the Anson\r\n\r\nby-election  has  been held, it is high time  for  the\r\n\r\nissue to be discussed at a joint conference of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Executive  Committee  and  the  51  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nBranches. But the Prime Minister dare not face  the\r\n\r\ncriticisms  of the members. He has not the  courage\r\n\r\nto  rectify his own errors. That is why he dare not\r\n\r\nconvene  a  conference to discuss the  issue  in  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic way. That being the case, he wants us to\r\n\r\nexpress  our  confidence in him. We know  that  our\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  and the minority  leadership  have\r\n\r\ncontrol  over the Government, and they want  us  to\r\n\r\nexpress our confidence in them. I think this course\r\n\r\nis  not  proper, because the Party leadership  have\r\n\r\nnot  absorbed any new experience or learnt  lessons\r\n\r\nfrom  collective  criticisms. They  have,  instead,\r\n\r\nresorted  to bringing this issue into the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe  purpose is to confuse the vision of the people\r\n\r\nand  to ask us to follow them blindly. I would like\r\n\r\nto  say that we have our basic stand, which  is  to\r\n\r\noppose  resolutely  colonialism  and  maintain  the\r\n\r\nrights  and  improve  the living  standard  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  So I think the Prime Minister's motion  is\r\n\r\nabsurd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you must be aware, from the\r\n\r\ncorrespondence between the Prime Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nParty  Chairman,  that there is a  passage  to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that  the Prime Minister said that  it  was\r\n\r\nanother  test of strength between the pro-Communist\r\n\r\nLeft  and  the  non-Communist Left,  and  that  the\r\n\r\npresent   Government  is  faced  with  new   forces\r\n\r\nlaunched  by  the  pro-Communist Left.  That  is  a\r\n\r\nmachination.  The Prime Minister thought  he  could\r\n\r\nconfuse the vision of the people so that they would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  see clearly what is ahead of them in the  path\r\n\r\ntaken by the minority leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the eight Assemblymen in the\r\n\r\nParty are accused of being Communists. Let me  tell\r\n\r\nyou  that there are many members who hold different\r\n\r\nopinions  from  those held by the  Prime  Minister.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that you can accuse them all  of\r\n\r\nbeing  Communists.  The  Prime  Minister  is   most\r\n\r\ncapable  in the use of new terminologies about  us,\r\n\r\nand this makes me sad and disheartened. I am afraid\r\n\r\nhis  political  bankruptcy  has  led  him  to  this\r\n\r\nimpasse.  The eight Assemblymen who hold  different\r\n\r\nviews  from those of the Prime Minister are accused\r\n\r\nof  being anti-national unity, anti-merger, and  so\r\n\r\non. These accusations are very serious and grave. I\r\n\r\nmust  solemnly  declare that I have  never  opposed\r\n\r\nnational unity with Malaya. I have taken a  similar\r\n\r\nstand  in the past and I shall continue to take  it\r\n\r\nin  the  future. The freedom and the rights of  the\r\n\r\npeople should be prerequisites to a merger. We must\r\n\r\nnot  sell out the interests of the people in  order\r\n\r\nto  achieve  merger. We know that  in  the  present\r\n\r\nsituation obtaining in Singapore democratic  rights\r\n\r\nhave  been  won through the struggle and sacrifices\r\n\r\nof many people in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe you have to eat bread\r\n\r\nto  gain  strength. Merger can be  likened  to  the\r\n\r\neating  of  bread and therefore we must  achieve  a\r\n\r\nmerger.  But we must understand that there must  be\r\n\r\nsomething in addition to bread, it could be butter,\r\n\r\njam or kaya. If you do not know what is spread on a\r\n\r\nslice  of bread, then you will not dare to  eat  it\r\n\r\nfor fear that it might contain poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I heard the speech of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  which lasted for more than  an  hour.  He\r\n\r\ngave vent to his feelings in his speech and it  can\r\n\r\nbe  described  very shortly. His  long  speech  was\r\n\r\nsomewhat  in the nature of some of the speeches  of\r\n\r\nthe  former  Chief  Minister,  Tun  Lim  Yew  Hock,\r\n\r\nbecause  at  that time Tun Lim did not  reveal  the\r\n\r\nfact that he had sold out the rights of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must remind the hon. Member\r\n\r\nthat  he must not use the name of a Member of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  He  must  refer to  the  Member  by  his\r\n\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  thank you for your direction. I want to point\r\n\r\nout  that  in  the  past the Chief Minister,  whose\r\n\r\nconstituency  was  Havelock,  was  in  a   quandary\r\n\r\nbecause  he was under pressure from all sides,  and\r\n\r\nthis  led  him  to take action detrimental  to  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  people. He did  not  reveal  his\r\n\r\naction and he did not want to know fully whether we\r\n\r\nwere genuine Leftists, or pro-Communists, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention here some of the\r\n\r\ndevelopments which have taken place after the Anson\r\n\r\nby-election culminating in the introduction of  the\r\n\r\npresent motion. In this respect I want to refer  to\r\n\r\nthe  speech  of the Member for Cairnhill.  We  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  result  of the Anson by-election  is  an\r\n\r\nindication  that the people are highly  politically\r\n\r\nconscious.  Their  choice in  this  by-election  is\r\n\r\ncorrect.   We  can  establish  this   fact   as   a\r\n\r\ncomparison. Now I want to mention the defeat of the\r\n\r\nLib-Socs and the Singapore Congress. Why were  they\r\n\r\ndefeated   so   pitifully?  In  the  1959   general\r\n\r\nelections the P.A.P. got-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder if the hon. Member\r\n\r\ncan indicate how the detailed results of Anson have\r\n\r\nany bearing on this particular motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, it\r\n\r\nis  because  today  this motion before  us  is  the\r\n\r\nresult  of the Anson by-election. If there were  no\r\n\r\nAnson by-election, there would not have been such a\r\n\r\nsudden  change in the political situation,  and  we\r\n\r\nmight not have to debate this motion today. That is\r\n\r\nwhy  I  have to deal with the cause of this  motion\r\n\r\nand  to  refer to a few points raised in the speech\r\n\r\nof  the  Prime Minister, who is now accused by  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Therefore,  as  a comparison,  I  have  to\r\n\r\nmention the number of votes polled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that the Party that was returned in\r\n\r\nAnson  in  the 1959 elections polled a majority  of\r\n\r\n3,292 votes, and the Lib-Socs only got 1,231 votes,\r\n\r\nas against 104 in that by-election. Moreover, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpposition  have united and formed themselves  into\r\n\r\nan  Alliance.  I want to mention this fact  because\r\n\r\nthis  will teach them a lesson as their past defeat\r\n\r\nwas  the  result of going against the will  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Therefore, after two years of  opposition,\r\n\r\nin  other  words, after two years of government  by\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., they had not criticised the Government\r\n\r\nin  regard to the welfare of the people.  They  did\r\n\r\nnot  do  so.  They  still  took  the  attitude   of\r\n\r\nselfishness, and therefore, they suffered a defeat.\r\n\r\nIn  their  speeches they repeatedly  said  that  if\r\n\r\ntoday's  motion is anti-Communist, then  they  will\r\n\r\nvote for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that we must understand the Communist Party\r\n\r\nwell.  We  have not seen the Communist  Party  here\r\n\r\nbecause they work only for themselves. If they  are\r\n\r\nagainst  the  people, then the people will  abandon\r\n\r\nthem.  In  other words, all sorts of illegal  terms\r\n\r\nsuch  as  \"pro-Communist\" and \"Communists\" will  be\r\n\r\nused  in  order that an opportunity is provided  to\r\n\r\nsay, \"You are a Communist and you can be detained.\"\r\n\r\nThat  is  why  I  say that the people's  livelihood\r\n\r\ndepends  on their attaining liberty. For  instance,\r\n\r\nif  my  wish is to hive in a house made of concrete\r\n\r\nand so on, but I could only build an attap hut, how\r\n\r\ncan  society  progress?  Usually  statesmen  cannot\r\n\r\nrealise  their  wishes and since they  cannot  give\r\n\r\nanything   to  the  people,  therefore   they   are\r\n\r\nabandoned  by  the  people.  And  when   they   are\r\n\r\nabandoned  by  the people, they have to  resort  to\r\n\r\ntactics  to deal with such a situation. Under  this\r\n\r\ndemocratic    system,   they   use   barbaric    or\r\n\r\nundemocratic  methods to deal with  it.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthere are some terms which are illegal in law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to touch on what one of my colleagues said\r\n\r\njust now. She said that she was very sad to see the\r\n\r\nsituation  in this Assembly today, that  the  eight\r\n\r\nMembers in the P.A.P. deserted the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us find out why the leadership met with defeat\r\n\r\nin  Anson.  It  could be attributed  to  their  not\r\n\r\nknowing  how  to  lead,  perhaps  not  getting  the\r\n\r\nopinions  of  all  strata  in  the  Party  who  are\r\n\r\nconscious  of the needs of the people, and  thereby\r\n\r\nnot adopting a correct policy. It is because of the\r\n\r\nundemocratic attitude which they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  adopted  that has caused  the  people  to  be\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  with  them. If the  Party  leadership\r\n\r\ncould  listen to the opinions voiced by  our  eight\r\n\r\nMembers here, and if they disagreed and so declared\r\n\r\nto  the people the contents of their speeches, then\r\n\r\nthey  would have retained their support  and  would\r\n\r\nnot have suffered such a crushing defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We released the letter openly, the reason being\r\n\r\nthat  our  Party had neglected our  request  for  a\r\n\r\ndiscussion. On the one hand, they said they  wanted\r\n\r\nto discuss with us, but on the other hand, they let\r\n\r\nMr  Devan Nair make a statement on behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nParty  at  a  forum  organised  by  the  University\r\n\r\nSocialist  Club at the University of Malaya,  which\r\n\r\nled  to  the result of the Anson by-election.  They\r\n\r\nomitted  to  make  a statement  in  the  Anson\r\n\r\nby-election.  This  caused general dissatisfaction  to\r\n\r\nthe  people of Anson. Therefore, the disclosure  of\r\n\r\nthis  letter  disproved what Mr Nair had  said  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  people in that constituency  would  know\r\n\r\nthat there is still some democracy in our Party and\r\n\r\nour  Party can still have some hope of carrying out\r\n\r\nthe  job of serving the people. On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nif our letter had caused the defeat of the Party in\r\n\r\nthe  Anson  by-election, then one point had  to  be\r\n\r\nacknowledged - the onus should not be on  us  but  on\r\n\r\nthe  leadership. Because if we were wrong, then why\r\n\r\nshould the people still follow us? Just now I  said\r\n\r\nthat the Four-Party Alliance had a reduced poll  in\r\n\r\nthe  by-election. This shows that  the  people  are\r\n\r\nalways correct. They are always progressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us now deal with some points\r\n\r\nraised by the hon. Member for the Southern Islands.\r\n\r\nThe  hon. Member said that he was speaking  on  the\r\n\r\nsame theme as the hon. Member for Cairnhill. He said\r\n\r\nthat our Party claimed to be anti-Communist and yet\r\n\r\nalleged  that there are Communists in our Party.  I\r\n\r\nmust  say  that  this blame should be  put  on  the\r\n\r\nleadership  of  our Party, as one of our  spokesmen\r\n\r\nhas  said  just  now, because the problem  was  not\r\n\r\nproperly  dealt with. Usually they resort to  using\r\n\r\nvery unpleasant terms about certain people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere  I must refer to certain points raised by  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member for the Southern Islands. He said that\r\n\r\nthe  leadership of the Party must not speak in such\r\n\r\na  tone  when  they cannot achieve their  aims  and\r\n\r\nresort  to  all sorts of mean tactics in  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve their purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, lastly, I must necessarily remind all here that those who cause misery will ultimately\r\n\r\ncause  their own destruction. They will finally  be\r\n\r\njudged  by the people. I will remind them  that  no\r\n\r\nmatter  what our members in the Party or Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers say, they have to bear this in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has at last thought fit to disclose\r\n\r\npublicly that within his Party there are two  rival\r\n\r\ngroups  -the  Communist Left and the  non-Communist\r\n\r\nLeft.  Sir, this is a very serious disclosure  with\r\n\r\nserious  implications. One implication is that  for\r\n\r\nthe sake of winning the last general elections, the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party was prepared to welcome  into\r\n\r\nits  arms the Communist Left. Was that a wise move?\r\n\r\nThe  second implication, Sir, is that while in  the\r\n\r\nFederation   the   Communists   are   regarded   as\r\n\r\nsubversive  elements, the policy of  the  governing\r\n\r\nParty  here  is such that those who  come  over  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  join their Party  are  given  legal\r\n\r\nprotection.  Sir,  how is this  going  to  help  in\r\n\r\npromoting good relations between Singapore and  the\r\n\r\nFederation?  Another  very serious  implication  is\r\n\r\nthat  if,  in  the  struggle for power  within  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party, the Communist Left  manages\r\n\r\nto take over control, that means that the Communist\r\n\r\nParty  has  captured Singapore. Sir,  I  will  just\r\n\r\nmention those three implications and let the  group\r\n\r\nin  control  of  the  People's Action  Party  think\r\n\r\nseriously, and think of what steps they should take\r\n\r\nto rectify the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have listened to two very dramatic stories\r\n\r\nof  behind-the-scenes struggle; on the one hand, of\r\n\r\nplots and counter plots, of moves made by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish,   by  the  Communist  Left  and   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and on the other hand, we  have  heard\r\n\r\nfrom the dissident group accusations of the lack of\r\n\r\ndemocracy in the party organisation and so  on.  We\r\n\r\nbelieve  that very likely the truth is to be  found\r\n\r\nin  both  versions.  Sir, to  me,  four  points  of\r\n\r\nimportance   have  emerged.  Firstly,   that   this\r\n\r\nstruggle for power within the Party must have  been\r\n\r\nvery  intense,  so intense that it has  had  to  he\r\n\r\nbrought  to the notice of the public. But it  shows\r\n\r\nalso  that  a  Party  in  power  which  depends  on\r\n\r\nCommunist  elements for its strength  cannot  be  a\r\n\r\nstable  government. Therefore, how is the Party  in\r\n\r\npower  going  to  attract  investors,  or  help  to\r\n\r\nrestore  a  climate of confidence to this  country,\r\n\r\nthereby producing more factories, establishing more\r\n\r\nindustries, and, therefore, producing more jobs for\r\n\r\nthe unemployed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point is this. The Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas  stated  that  his group is still  prepared  to\r\n\r\nprotect the Communist Party. Sir, this must be very\r\n\r\ndisturbing  to  many in Singapore, the  Federation,\r\n\r\nBrunei, Borneo and Sarawak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen in history in recent years that we\r\n\r\ncannot  under-rate,  we cannot  under-estimate  the\r\n\r\nstrength and the skill of the Communist leaders. If\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister and his friends think that they\r\n\r\ncan  outwit  the  Communist  leadership,  they  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to do what other leaders in other countries\r\n\r\nhave  failed. We are not saying that the Communists\r\n\r\nare  not human beings. They are. Personally I  have\r\n\r\nno hatred for my fellow human beings. But we do not\r\n\r\nwant   an   ideology  which  enslaves  the  people,\r\n\r\ndepriving  them of their freedom to think  and  act\r\n\r\nfor themselves. Sir, that is where we differ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. The People's Action Party\r\n\r\nconsiders  that  the  only way to  independence  is\r\n\r\nthrough merger. Sir, we have agreed with them,  but\r\n\r\nwe  have also expressed our doubts whether  in  the\r\n\r\npresent context this merger with the Federation  is\r\n\r\nnow  possible. What with the disclosures that  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made,  I am sure the chances of  merger  have\r\n\r\nbecome more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremote.  Therefore,  the only way  to  independence\r\n\r\nwhile preserving good relations would be through  a\r\n\r\nconfederation  of independent States  where  we  in\r\n\r\nSingapore do not endanger in any way the people  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation or in other neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  believe the ruling group in  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party are also in agreement with this.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has  said  that  his  duty  is  to\r\n\r\npreserve the People's Action Party in the midst  of\r\n\r\nzigzagging manoeuvres. I may have left  out  a  few\r\n\r\nwords,  Sir, I  have tried to copy them  verbatim.\r\n\r\nSurely the primary aim of a political Party is  not\r\n\r\nto  preserve its own self, but to serve the people\r\n\r\nof  the  country, to promote their  welfare,  their\r\n\r\nsecurity, their freedom. And if it is necessary for\r\n\r\nthe  Party to sacrifice itself for the sake of  the\r\n\r\ncountry, then if we are statesmen we will sacrifice\r\n\r\nour   Party  for  our  country.  But  if   we   are\r\n\r\npoliticians, Sir, then the Party comes  first.  The\r\n\r\npeople  can  go  to hell. Sir, the  motion,  as  it\r\n\r\nstands, goes against the feelings of the people. If\r\n\r\nyou  say  that  the people have confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   then   we  are  going   against   the\r\n\r\nexpression  of  opinion  of  the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The people are dissatisfied with the  way,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has treated the  employees-drastic\r\n\r\npay  cuts  without  proper  negotiations,  and  now\r\n\r\npartial  restoration in a very dilatory  manner.  I\r\n\r\nmean,  Sir, from the very start there was no ground\r\n\r\nfor  those  pay  cuts and, therefore,  morally  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should restore all the  pay  cuts,  and\r\n\r\nthereafter  negotiate on the basis of  the  present\r\n\r\nfinancial  state  of  the  country  for  a   proper\r\n\r\nreduction in salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, very likely the complaints of the rebel group\r\n\r\nare  correct.  When people cannot be democratic  in\r\n\r\ntheir own Party, how can they be democratic towards\r\n\r\nthe  citizens  of a country? In their treatment  of\r\n\r\nthe  teachers, we regret to say that the Government\r\n\r\nare  applying  a principle which cannot  be  called\r\n\r\nsocialistic. More work for less pay. More work  per\r\n\r\nday.  More days per week. It is therefore difficult\r\n\r\nto  maintain the efficiency of the education system\r\n\r\nof  this country under such conditions. How can you\r\n\r\nblame the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteachers  if they are dissatisfied and if  many  of\r\n\r\nthem seek better conditions of service elsewhere?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the number of unemployed is increasing, and\r\n\r\nwhen the children leave school, what prospects have\r\n\r\nthey?  Again  and again I have met former  students\r\n\r\nsome of whom have been unemployed for the last  two\r\n\r\nyears.  What  prospects  of  employment  have  they\r\n\r\nexcept  to  join the Work Brigade? Naturally,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  people are dissatisfied. They are unhappy. The\r\n\r\neconomic condition of the country is declining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to these disclosures. How can we say\r\n\r\nthat  the government of the country is going to  be\r\n\r\nmore  stable? Sir, we realise that the  leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe  People's Action Party perhaps were sincere  in\r\n\r\ntheir  motive  and  have  made  mistakes  in  their\r\n\r\nmethods.  But if they want to regain the confidence\r\n\r\nof  the people, they must be humble enough to admit\r\n\r\nand  to rectify their mistakes. If they will  treat\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore more like human beings than\r\n\r\nas  robots,  as pieces of machinery,  perhaps  they\r\n\r\nwill  get  a  better response. The  leader  of  the\r\n\r\nAlliance  has  said  that if the  purpose  of  this\r\n\r\nmotion  is  to enable the leaders of the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nprevent   Singapore  from  falling  into  Communist\r\n\r\nhands,  we  will  not embarrass them.  But  if  the\r\n\r\nmotion is to obtain from us an affirmation that the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  are  satisfied   and   have\r\n\r\nconfidence in the Government, then I regret to say,\r\n\r\nin  the face of what we know, that we are not  able\r\n\r\nto do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I am indeed surprised  to  hear\r\n\r\njust  now from the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Health that differences  within  the\r\n\r\nParty  should be thrashed out in the Party,  and  I\r\n\r\ninvite the eight stalwarts of intra-party democracy\r\n\r\nto  take heed of what their colleague has said.  It\r\n\r\nwas  these  very  eight traitorous Assemblymen  who\r\n\r\nflouted the decision made by the P.A.P. Assemblymen\r\n\r\nthemselves by taking internal party issues  to  the\r\n\r\npublic,  and  that  at a time when  the  Party  was\r\n\r\nfighting a crucial by-election in Anson. Was  there\r\n\r\nany\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsultation  prior  to the  publication  of  their\r\n\r\nstatement in the Press? We were engaged in fighting\r\n\r\na  by-election  while these so-called  loyal  eight\r\n\r\nAssemblymen and the Parliamentary Secretaries  were\r\n\r\nbitterly  engaged in sinister plottings behind  our\r\n\r\nbacks.  This. I suppose, is what they  call \r\n\r\nintra-party  democracy. I do not wish to delve  into  the\r\n\r\ntroubles of my Party in this House. But suffice  it\r\n\r\nto  say that if the Parliamentary Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Home  Affairs  finds  the   Party's\r\n\r\nConstitution  so disgustingly undemocratic,  it  is\r\n\r\nindeed  surprising that he should have  joined  the\r\n\r\nParty  in  the first instance, stood as a candidate\r\n\r\non  its ticket and, together with the young man who\r\n\r\naspires   to   higher   office  the   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to the Minister for Health accepted  the\r\n\r\nposts  of Parliamentary Secretaries of a government\r\n\r\nwhich they accused of having no democracy. All this\r\n\r\ntalk of the undemocratic Constitution of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nreminds  one  of the voice of the Member  for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim.    For   their   information,   the    present\r\n\r\nConstitution  of  the  P.A.P. was,  to  a  certain\r\n\r\nextent,  the work of the Member for Hong  Lim  who,\r\n\r\nnot  so  long  ago,  also  accused  the  P.A.P. of\r\n\r\nundemocratic and lack of intra-party democracy.  In\r\n\r\ncase  the  Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Home Affairs is not aware, the Constitution  of\r\n\r\nthe Party was precisely designed to prevent capture\r\n\r\nby  insincere and disloyal party elements and those\r\n\r\nwho  willingly  allow  themselves  to  be  used  to\r\n\r\nfurther  a  cause which will only bring  chaos  and\r\n\r\ndisaster to the country. Intra-party democracy does\r\n\r\nnot mean stabbing your comrades in the back. \r\n\r\nIntra-party  democracy  does  not mean  discussing  party\r\n\r\ndifferences  by  issuing  public  statements  at  a\r\n\r\ncrucial  by-election to injure the  Party  and  its\r\n\r\ncandidate.  Intra-party  democracy  does  not  mean\r\n\r\ninviting outside forces to pressure the Party  into\r\n\r\ndeviating  from its basic objective of independence\r\n\r\nthrough merger. These are acts of treachery of  the\r\n\r\nworst kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well that the Assembly meets today to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  a  motion calling for a vote of confidence\r\n\r\nin  the Government at a time when the people  have\r\n\r\nbeen presented with a very clear picture of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe political situation in our island State. It  is\r\n\r\nequally  fortunate that events in the  recent  past\r\n\r\nhave  helped  greatly to remove the rather  blurred\r\n\r\npolitical lines, thus making it easier for  all  to\r\n\r\nwitness  the contest taking place in the  political\r\n\r\narena.  To  the extent that the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nare  also profoundly aware of the issues at  stake,\r\n\r\nthe motion before Us should bring out, as I am sure\r\n\r\nit  has brought out, the deeper significance  which\r\n\r\nunderlies it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might even add that even some of the more\r\n\r\nsimple-minded Members of the Opposition who were known  to\r\n\r\nhave  been concerned why the P.A.P. should  want  a\r\n\r\nnon-Communist,  socialist Malaya are  now  probably\r\n\r\nconvinced  about  the  wisdom of  this  categorical\r\n\r\nstand of the Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, today no\r\n\r\none  doubts  any longer what is meant by  the \r\n\r\nnon-Communist Left and the Communist Left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Hong Lim by-election the call to \"seek\r\n\r\nconcord while maintaining differences\" was made  by\r\n\r\nthe  anti-national Left. This call  may  have  gone\r\n\r\ndown  with some political innocents because at Hong\r\n\r\nLim  the constitutional issue had not then come  up\r\n\r\nto  the surface as it did at Anson. At Hong Lim the\r\n\r\ncall    to    \"seek   concord   while   maintaining\r\n\r\ndifferences\"  could  have  referred  to   or   mean\r\n\r\nanything the anti-national Left wanted it to  mean.\r\n\r\nThere was then no need for them to be specific.  It\r\n\r\nwas  then to their advantage not to be too specific\r\n\r\nin  this  call  to \"seek concord while  maintaining\r\n\r\ndifferences\". Under the circumstances, not only was\r\n\r\nthe  call to seek concord highlighted, but  it  was\r\n\r\nhighlighted  with such singing of praises  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  The  P.A.P. they consistently repeated  was\r\n\r\nwithin  the limitations of the situation: the  most\r\n\r\nprogressive  socialist  force  in  Singapore:   the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was  for  the people: the  P.A.P. was  the\r\n\r\nbanner to rally round to defeat Right-wing reaction\r\n\r\nand  opportunism:  the P.A.P. was  correct  in  its\r\n\r\nstand \"at this stage of our political history\", and\r\n\r\nso on and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that it is absolutely rubbish to talk\r\n\r\nabout  seeking  concord when your  differences  are\r\n\r\nfundamental\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  when  you seek basically different .goals.  We\r\n\r\nknow that it is foolish to talk about a united\r\n\r\nanti-colonial  front and Left-wing unity when our  stand\r\n\r\nwas  and is still an independent, democratic, \r\n\r\nnon-Communist, socialist Malaya. And that was  why,  as\r\n\r\nMalayan nationalists and socialists, we refused  to\r\n\r\nrespond  to the insincere call for Left-wing  unity\r\n\r\nupon which to seek concord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not sought concord because we are\r\n\r\ndemocratic  socialists. Any  Left-wing  unity  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  on  the basis of a  democratic, \r\n\r\nnon-Communist  Malayan  socialism.  And  the  stand  of\r\n\r\nMalayan  socialism  based  on  Malayan  nationalism\r\n\r\nbecame as clear as daylight when at Anson the\r\n\r\nanti-national   Left  showed  their  true  colours   and\r\n\r\nabandoned  our stand to continue with our  declared\r\n\r\nobjective  of  working  for  independence   through\r\n\r\nmerger with the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G.

They  have\r\n\r\nremained   silent  to  this  day  even  after   the\r\n\r\ntreachery  they committed against their  colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  President  of  the T.U.C., who  stood  as  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s candidate in Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I venture to suggest that they cannot answer the question even now, because it is\r\n\r\nnot  the  P.A.P. alone which is  waiting  for  the\r\n\r\nexplanation from them, but the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  the  people of the Federation of Malaya  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole   have  called  them  to  account  for  their\r\n\r\ndeviation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the motion before us will\r\n\r\nof  necessity  be  put to an open  vote,  precisely\r\n\r\nbecause   it  is  an  open  issue.  The   treachery\r\n\r\ncommitted by the non-national Leftist minority is a\r\n\r\nrecurrence  of  the same blunder committed  by  the\r\n\r\nM.C.P. 13 years ago.  In political terms,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot treachery against the P.A.P. as such, but it is\r\n\r\none    committed   against   Malayan    nationalism\r\n\r\ncomprising the Malays, Chinese and Indians and  all\r\n\r\nothers who belong to no other country but Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political innocents who have been so easily\r\n\r\nduped    into   shouting   about   the   detainees,\r\n\r\ncitizenship, etc, must be aware that the  fight  is\r\n\r\nstill a three-cornered one until such time as  when\r\n\r\nwe achieve merdeka through merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is today an acknowledged fact that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis  a nationalist force in the southernmost part of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  Any  anti-national  move  whether  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Left or the communalist  Right  will  he\r\n\r\nlooked  upon by the people of Malaya as detrimental\r\n\r\nto the interests of Malayan nationalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I express complete support for the motion before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

It is like a quarrel between\r\n\r\nhusband  and  wife. That is to say,  the  wife  has\r\n\r\nfraternised  with another person and  the  husband,\r\n\r\nnot  knowing what to do, has therefore  gone  to  a\r\n\r\nthird  party to seek reconciliation. As for me,  if\r\n\r\nmy wife flirts with another man, I will give her  a\r\n\r\ndivorce  of the third degree! I hope the Government\r\n\r\nwill take such a step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein has accused us of being a\r\n\r\nrojak  Party.  That is a stupid accusation.  I  can\r\n\r\naccuse  the P.A.P. of being a gadoh-gadoh Party.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  that you. Mr Deputy Speaker, has  tasted\r\n\r\ngadoh-gadoh. It is very delicious indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government\r\n\r\nhas  constantly  accused us of being pro-capitalist,\r\n\r\npro-colonialist,  etc. If we are pro-capitalist  or\r\n\r\npro-colonialist, why do they seek support from  us?\r\n\r\nLet them be bold and go forward and do not come  to\r\n\r\nus for support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  this Government is sincere and is dedicated  to\r\n\r\nserve  the  people  of Singapore,  it  should  take\r\n\r\npositive  and  definite steps in  the  interest  of\r\n\r\npeace, as we did when we were in the Government. It\r\n\r\nshould  not  shirk its responsibility.  It  has  to\r\n\r\nrealise its responsibility. If it fails, to realise\r\n\r\nthat, then it should get out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we have learnt today that Communist elements tried to disrupt the P.A.P. in\r\n\r\nthe  troubled days faced by the P.A.P. in 1957.  It\r\n\r\nis only today that this is exposed despite the fact\r\n\r\nthat  we had explained in this Chamber when we were\r\n\r\nin  the  Government that such events emanated  from\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan  Communist  Party.  The  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said that they were able to eliminate  the\r\n\r\nM.C.P. elements during the troubled  days  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in  1957  because of the  strength  of  the\r\n\r\nParty. This is completely wrong, because it was the\r\n\r\nLim Yew Hock Government which helped the P.A.P. if\r\n\r\nat  that  time the Lim Yew Hock Government did  not\r\n\r\narrest and put these elements into Changi Gaol, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  the  Deputy Prime  Minister,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health and other Ministers could  not\r\n\r\nhave held office in the P.A.P in 1957. So we helped\r\n\r\nthem  out  of  their difficulties;  otherwise  they\r\n\r\nwould not be in existence today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another accusation was made by the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the  Minister for Health  about  our\r\n\r\ngreat  leader, Tunku Abdul Rahman, on the  question\r\n\r\nof  confederation. He accused the Tunku  of  making\r\n\r\nsuch  a  proposition with the help and co-operation\r\n\r\nof  the British, which means that he was a tool  of\r\n\r\nthe  British. This is a very serious accusation and\r\n\r\nI  challenge the hon. Member to repeat that outside\r\n\r\nthe  precincts of the Assembly.

I seem to remember that\r\n\r\nin  1956 the Member for Anson, who was then sitting\r\n\r\nat  the back there [indicating], issued a challenge\r\n\r\nto  the present Prime Minister who was then sitting\r\n\r\nin  the Opposition as the Member for Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\nThe  challenge  was  taken up  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar, but the present Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\ndid not take part in the Tanjong Pagar by-election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I challenge the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Health to repeat what  he  has  said\r\n\r\noutside,  because  I know for a  fact  that  it  is\r\n\r\nnothing but a lie. If there are people in Singapore\r\n\r\nor   in   Malaya  who  resolutely  oppose   British\r\n\r\ncolonialism,  Tunku Abdul Rahman is  one  of  them.\r\n\r\nThere is no braver person than the Tunku himself to\r\n\r\noppose British colonialism. It is our leader, Tunku\r\n\r\nAbdul  Rahman,  who  challenged  the  British.   He\r\n\r\nuttered  speeches which no other leaders  dared  to\r\n\r\ndo. Now there are people who say that they are\r\n\r\nanti-colonialist.  At  that time, if  they  could  have\r\n\r\nlicked  the  feet of the British, they  would  have\r\n\r\ndone  so.  Similarly in the speeches of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson during the Anson by-election, be accused\r\n\r\nindirectly  and insinuated that Tunku Abdul  Rahman\r\n\r\nis  anti-Chinese. He dared to say this without  any\r\n\r\nfoundation. That is also a lie. It is not true  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  Tunku  Abdul Rahman is anti-Chinese.  We\r\n\r\nwill  most  definitely  not  co-operate  with   the\r\n\r\nM.C.A.,  and  for  that matter with  any  political\r\n\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at the forum held at the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Malaya,  representatives   of   the\r\n\r\nvarious political Parties - the Alliance, the Workers\r\n\r\nParty and a trade union group - discussed the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblem  of  Malaysia. I was  not  present  at  the\r\n\r\nforum,   but  I  was  surprised,  on  reading   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  the  following day, to learn  that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson referred to his meeting with  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  of  the  Federation,  Tunku  Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman,  in 1955 on the subject of a merger between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read of it. I was really amazed because I\r\n\r\nmyself  was in the company of the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nat  the meeting that morning with the Tunku in  his\r\n\r\nold  house - not  his new house. At  that  time,  the\r\n\r\nTunku  was not the Prime Minister. He was the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister. I was present at that meeting. Why I  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  explanation of the Member for  Anson  is\r\n\r\nfalse  is  because he stated that there was  a  big\r\n\r\nfunction  that morning. I was present with  him  in\r\n\r\nthe Tunku's house. I remember we had kopi-o (coffee\r\n\r\nwithout milk), one egg, some toast and butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member for Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai  satisfy  me  that this is relevant  to  this\r\n\r\nmotion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbelieve there is some relevance to the motion  that\r\n\r\nwe are debating now because the Prime Minister, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson and other Members dwelt  at  some\r\n\r\nlength on the problem of Malaysia. So I would  like\r\n\r\nto explain what took place in Kuala Lumpur in 1956,\r\n\r\notherwise  such statements might mislead  not  only\r\n\r\nMembers  in this House but also the people  outside\r\n\r\nthis House. It is not that I wish to sing anybody's\r\n\r\npraises,  but this is based on fact. I  have  asked\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku  to  rebut the statements  made  at  the\r\n\r\nforum, but he, being a gentleman, considered  it  a\r\n\r\nsmall  matter  and that there was no necessity  for\r\n\r\nhim  to  make  a  denial. Therefore,  I  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity   to  raise  this  small   issue.   The\r\n\r\nstatements  hold no truth. The statements  made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Anson in regard to the Tunku  were\r\n\r\ndistorted  facts. I was present at that meeting.  I\r\n\r\nsincerely say that three-quarters of what  appeared\r\n\r\nin  the Press was not true - not lies, but not  true.\r\n\r\nIf  I  say  they  were \"lies\", I may  be  asked  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw that word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, what we are now faced\r\n\r\nwith  is  not  the  problem  of  the  P.A.P. as  a\r\n\r\npolitical  Party  or the internal struggle  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. The problem confronting us is, in my view, a\r\n\r\nvery  serious one. If we are not careful,  we  will\r\n\r\ncreate a situation which we do not want to see. The\r\n\r\nstand  of  the Alliance - particularly  U.M.N.O.-is\r\n\r\nclear.  We oppose the Communists. On this Communist\r\n\r\nproblem,  I  would like to state that  we,  as  the\r\n\r\nindigenous people of Malaya, are prepared  to  shed\r\n\r\nour blood in the fight against the Communists. That\r\n\r\nis  our uncompromising stand in any event, even  if\r\n\r\nour  houses are set on fire. At the same time,  not\r\n\r\nonly  is  the  Communist  problem  a  danger,   but\r\n\r\ncommunalism  also is a danger, just as  nationalism\r\n\r\nis,  i.e. nationalism Left, or nationalism  Right.\r\n\r\nBut  in communalism, there is no Left or Right. One\r\n\r\nkind of communalism is for a special race, and  the\r\n\r\nother  is being used by political opportunists.  If\r\n\r\nsuch a state of affairs exists I hope this will not\r\n\r\nhappen  in Singapore - the victims will not  only  be\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. alone, or the Alliance, or the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson, but all the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the motion before us and which is\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the  Government, we of the Alliance  say\r\n\r\nthat  although we oppose Communism, we do not  wish\r\n\r\nto  be tools of anybody when it comes to voting  on\r\n\r\nthe motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  I believe you  are  very  much\r\n\r\nconcerned  over  the political  situation  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry. Therefore, I know you will be glad to hear\r\n\r\nall  our views on the whole political situation and\r\n\r\nits developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disputes that have taken place in our Party\r\n\r\ncan  be  traced  to  the lack of democracy  in  the\r\n\r\nParty.  People in the minority make decisions,  and\r\n\r\npeople who are in the majority have to follow them.\r\n\r\nIn   order  to  enable  the  democratic  system  to\r\n\r\nfunction  and  to  be accepted in this  country,  a\r\n\r\nworker of a democratic political Party has the duty\r\n\r\nto see that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere   is   democracy  in  the  Party.  But   the\r\n\r\nleadership in our Party, on the contrary, have been\r\n\r\nshouting  very  loudly  the  word  \"democracy\"  and\r\n\r\npretending  to  be  democratic  when  there  is  no\r\n\r\ndemocratic  spirit  at  all.  The  suppression   of\r\n\r\ndemocracy for a long time in our Party has led to a\r\n\r\nbig breach in the Left-wing forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we grieve very much at the whole situation\r\n\r\nand  its  developments, because all along  we  have\r\n\r\nonly  been able to work within a limited degree  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  But today we can no longer  allow  this\r\n\r\nstate of affairs to go on forever. We have tried to\r\n\r\navoid  bringing  this dispute into  the  open,  but\r\n\r\nunfortunately our leadership have neglected and are\r\n\r\nindifferent to our views. They treat us as  members\r\n\r\nwho  ought to be loyal to only a few leaders.  Here\r\n\r\nlet  me tell the leadership this - we know that what\r\n\r\nwe  are  loyal to is the People's Action Party  and\r\n\r\nits  programmes.  We  support the  People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty and its programmes and its objectives and  we\r\n\r\nwill  not  waver. As long as colonialism exists  in\r\n\r\nthis  country,  the struggle to liberate  ourselves\r\n\r\nwill not cease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why have the differences between us and the\r\n\r\nleadership  developed to such a stage  as  this?  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  you  must  have read our  Party  platform,\r\n\r\nconstitution and regulations and its manifesto.  It\r\n\r\nis  clear  that today everybody can  see  that  our\r\n\r\nleadership  have not adhered to the  principles  of\r\n\r\nthe  Party  and its manifesto in dealing  with  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  principles  and  they  have  departed\r\n\r\nfurther  and further from this objective. From  the\r\n\r\ndeeds and words of our Secretary-General, we do not\r\n\r\nbelieve that he is what he was. Our leadership  are\r\n\r\nnot  prepared to implement the Party's  objectives.\r\n\r\nInstead  they  accuse us of being traitors.  But  I\r\n\r\nwish to ask: who are the traitors? I think this can\r\n\r\nbe  decided  by our members. But I want  to  stress\r\n\r\nthat the Prime Minister and his leadership call  us\r\n\r\nthe  Communist Left, and that he and his colleagues\r\n\r\nare  the non-Communist Left. We feel ashamed and  we\r\n\r\nregret  that  in  addition to all  this  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister likes to coin all sorts of new and curious\r\n\r\nphrases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the leadership employ this sort\r\n\r\nof  tactics to spread terror far and wide among the\r\n\r\npeople  so as to dissuade them from supporting  our\r\n\r\nobjectives.  This sort of tactics will not  deceive\r\n\r\nthe people for long. We want to stress further that\r\n\r\never  since  1954 up till now, our  stand  has  not\r\n\r\nchanged.  We  have  not changed  from  a  socialist\r\n\r\nstand.  We are not like some people who put on  the\r\n\r\ncloak of Left-wing socialists. As a matter of fact,\r\n\r\nthis group of people are really just like the \r\n\r\nRight-wing  reactionaries. I believe  you,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nunderstand this. History will record who really are\r\n\r\nthe traitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe you know that those\r\n\r\npolitical detainees still under detention  are  our\r\n\r\ncomrades.  In  the  history  of  our  Party   these\r\n\r\ncomrades have contributed much to expand our  Party\r\n\r\nand  they  have  made great sacrifices.  They  have\r\n\r\ndevoted much energy and have worked for the  Party,\r\n\r\nbut  colonialist  agents  like  the  Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment  adopted high-handed tactics  to  arrest\r\n\r\nthem.  They  were  charged by the  colonialists  as\r\n\r\nCommunists.  These  comrades are  the  former  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  Branch  Chairman, Mr  Tan  Mook  Teng,  the\r\n\r\nformer   Secretary,  Hong  Cheng  Han,  and   other\r\n\r\ncomrades.  They are still being detained.  And  our\r\n\r\nleadership,  after  having been  in  power  for  25\r\n\r\nmonths,   still  keep  our  comrades  in  gaol   as\r\n\r\nCommunists. As long as they are not released, it is\r\n\r\na  mockery to the Party and its members. Therefore,\r\n\r\nI   feel   the  continued  detention  of  political\r\n\r\ndetainees is a shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think you must have heard of the dispute in our Party about intra-party democracy.\r\n\r\nThere  has  been  talk  of  policies  having   been\r\n\r\napproved as a result of consultation among  various\r\n\r\ntypes  of  members. This may appear to be  true  to\r\n\r\noutsiders,  but the true picture of the  collective\r\n\r\nleadership  is this, Mr Speaker. I dare  say  that\r\n\r\nmany  policies have been approved as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nconsultation  among the various types  of  members,\r\n\r\nbut  without the knowledge of many of us, including\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries and Party members in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to make special mention\r\n\r\nof  the  question of citizenship. It  is  indeed  a\r\n\r\nshame for me\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto bring this matter up, because, as members of the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Action  Party,  we  have  been  fighting\r\n\r\nshoulder  to  shoulder  with  many  comrades  whose\r\n\r\napplications  for  citizenship  are   still   being\r\n\r\ndisregarded.  This,  just  like  the  question   of\r\n\r\ncontinued  detention  of  political  detainees,  is\r\n\r\nagain  another  insult  to us.  We  cannot  forever\r\n\r\nremain  indifferent  in  this  matter  because   it\r\n\r\naffects the future of the Party. We have seen  many\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore who voted in 1957  and  1959\r\n\r\nduring the general elections. But now because  they\r\n\r\nhave  lost  their  birth  certificates,  they   are\r\n\r\nrequired to apply for citizenship. Is this  not  an\r\n\r\nirony?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to talk about the\r\n\r\nincrease of school fees of school girls. We  had  a\r\n\r\ndiscussion about this. This policy has been adopted\r\n\r\nin  spite of the opposition of many of the members.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  this  is typical  of  the  so-called\r\n\r\ncollective  leadership. The majority has  to  obey\r\n\r\nthe minority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now want to talk about the allocation of flats\r\n\r\nand the fixing of rents by the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.  At present, the houses allocated  are\r\n\r\nfewer  than  formerly and the rents are higher,  so\r\n\r\nthat those with a great burden to shoulder - the\r\n\r\nwage-earners - are unable to stay there. This is  the \r\n\r\nso-called  socialist objective of our leadership.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, we have heard this leadership talking\r\n\r\nabout  socialism,  about the equality  of  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen. To increase the fees of school girls to make\r\n\r\nthem  the  same  as  those of school  boys - that  is\r\n\r\nequality!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of personal relief on income tax. In\r\n\r\nthe case of men, $2,000 is allowed; but in the case\r\n\r\nof  women only $1,000 is allowed. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis is equality between men and women. This is the\r\n\r\ncriterion of socialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today at this special sitting we\r\n\r\nare  required to pass a vote of confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I  am puzzled why this  matter  should\r\n\r\nhave  been  brought  up  here  for  decision.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, why could this matter not be  decided\r\n\r\nby the 51 Branches of the Party? We have 39 members\r\n\r\nin  the Assembly and we are as stable as ever.  Why\r\n\r\nshould  there  be  such a show  of  democracy?  For\r\n\r\nexample, the Ong Eng Guan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincident and the defeat in the Hong Lim by-election\r\n\r\nwere   discussed   in   the   Party   by   the   51\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from the various Branches.  Why  is\r\n\r\nthe  present incident not referred to in a  similar\r\n\r\nmanner?  Why  should it be more  serious  than  the\r\n\r\nincident  I  have  just quoted?  According  to  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of collective leadership, there  is  all\r\n\r\nthe more reason for this decision to be made in the\r\n\r\nParty. They have no guts, as in the past, to  bring\r\n\r\nthis matter for decision in the Party. It is purely\r\n\r\nan internal party strife. It should be brought back\r\n\r\nto the Party for decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now we have heard the\r\n\r\nformer Chief Minister, Tun Lim Yew Hock, saying  to\r\n\r\nthe  leadership  of the Party that  if  this  is  a\r\n\r\nmotion  to  eradicate Communism, then he will  vote\r\n\r\nfor  the motion. We here have listened to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister making his analysis. He treated his former\r\n\r\ncomrades,  with  whom  he had  fought  shoulder  to\r\n\r\nshoulder,   as  the  Communist  Left.  The   Prime.\r\n\r\nMinister  has  all  along been working  with  these\r\n\r\npeople, and why should he brand them as Communists?\r\n\r\nWhy should he protect them instead of accusing them\r\n\r\nhere  today?  I  think this is a  sort  of  \"white\"\r\n\r\nterror.  We  have  seen the former  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nusing  his tactics again before our leadership.  He\r\n\r\nwants  our leadership to make use of the same dirty\r\n\r\ntricks. We believe that our claim at present and in\r\n\r\nthe future is the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand the Secretary General's letter\r\n\r\nto  the  Chairman of the Party. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is the Sin Chew Jit Poh of the 19th of  July.\r\n\r\nThere  is  here  a  criticism to this  effect.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  represents the people. The  Government,\r\n\r\non  behalf  of  the  people,  intends  to  do  many\r\n\r\nunpleasant things. But we know that the people have\r\n\r\nelected  us. Why did they elect us? Was it  because\r\n\r\nthey  wanted us to do something unpleasant to them?\r\n\r\nOr  whether  they wanted us to sell them?  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  cannot  be  explained in  this  way,  because\r\n\r\neveryone  wants to retain forever a good  name  and\r\n\r\nnot a bad name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now want to talk about a\r\n\r\nfemale  Member  who  is  a member  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nExecutive Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust  now,  Mr Speaker, if you have  listened  to\r\n\r\nher,  she  may have appeared to be reasonable.  But\r\n\r\nthis particular comrade of the feminine sex may not\r\n\r\nhave  understood the whole affair. How many  cadres\r\n\r\nare  there in the Party nobody knows. We know  that\r\n\r\nin the Hokkien Huay Kuan the cadres elected on 30th\r\n\r\nMay,   1959,  have  since  been  disqualified   and\r\n\r\nwithdrawn. We believe that all the Members in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly are cadres. According to this, if  we  are\r\n\r\nnot   cadres,  surely  we  would  not   have   been\r\n\r\ncandidates  for the elections and the  Party  would\r\n\r\nnot  have trusted us. But the strange thing is that\r\n\r\namong  the eight of us, two are not cadres  of  the\r\n\r\nParty.  Therefore, this question has arisen out  of\r\n\r\ninternal  party strife, and I think  it  should  be\r\n\r\nbrought  back to the Parts for a decision  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  Party  will be more united and can stand  more\r\n\r\nfirmly  on  its  standpoint to  achieve  its  \r\n\r\nanti-colonialist aims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, Singapore has been looked up to as one of  the\r\n\r\npolitically advanced countries compared  with  many\r\n\r\nareas  around  it. It is a matter  of  regret  that\r\n\r\ntoday, when Members of Parliament from overseas are\r\n\r\npresent in this House, the P.A.P. Government should\r\n\r\npresent such a pathetic spectacle and give  such  a\r\n\r\nclassic exhibition and example of how parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  could be abused. Sir, what has  happened\r\n\r\ntoday  is not something new. This is not the  first\r\n\r\ntime  that  Government  has used  Standing  Orders,\r\n\r\nparliamentary    democracy   and   the    Singapore\r\n\r\nconstitution,  to  bring party quarrels  into  this\r\n\r\nChamber,  and to thrash out party differences.  You\r\n\r\nwill  remember, Sir, when the Member for  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nwent against the Prime Minister, we have had to sit\r\n\r\nhere   session  after  session,  day   after   day,\r\n\r\nlistening  to the P.A.P. scolding and accusing \r\n\r\nex-P.A.P. and vice-versa. And all this, Sir, is  done\r\n\r\nat public expense, mind you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, today when the P.A.P. Back-benchers are\r\n\r\ndefying  the party leadership, we are again brought\r\n\r\ninto this Chamber and asked to give a vote\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof confidence to the Government. We have constantly\r\n\r\nbeen   pointing   out  to  the   Government   their\r\n\r\ninefficiency,  their arrogance, their  undemocratic\r\n\r\nbehaviour,  and  the  damage  they  have  done   to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and her economy. Sir, I am  sure  I  can\r\n\r\ncredit   the   P.A.P. leaders   with   sufficient\r\n\r\nintelligence  to know that we will  not  give  them\r\n\r\nthis  vote of confidence on the part that they have\r\n\r\nplayed, or on their past non-achievements.  I  also\r\n\r\ncongratulate   the  leadership,   Sir,   on   their\r\n\r\ningenuity  in  creating  a  situation  which   they\r\n\r\nthought would corner the Opposition. They tried  to\r\n\r\nmake  it  so  that we either voted for them  or  we\r\n\r\nwould  be supporting what they called the Communist\r\n\r\nLeft-wing. The Prime Minister hoped, Sir, with  his\r\n\r\nMr  Lion  and Mr Bear fairy tale, to channel  the\r\n\r\nissue to either we vote for the non-Communist  Left\r\n\r\nor  the Communist Left. On second thoughts, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwas  wondering whether this is meant only  for  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  Only it is also meant for the  general\r\n\r\npublic,  to make them feel that there is  no  other\r\n\r\nParty or people except the Communist Left and \r\n\r\nnon-Communist Left-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Speaker is seated in this\r\n\r\nChair and not in the gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. So that the\r\n\r\npublic  will  have to decide whether they  want  to\r\n\r\nside with the Government or, if they do not want to\r\n\r\nside  with the Government, then they will  have  to\r\n\r\nside with the Communist Left. But, Sir, it must  be\r\n\r\nadmitted  that it is now obvious from the speeches,\r\n\r\nespecially  those of the Back-benchers (who,  if  I\r\n\r\nremember rightly, without exception, called  for  a\r\n\r\n51-Branch  meeting) and from that  call,  that  the\r\n\r\nreal  issue before the House is whether the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders should convene a general meeting of the  51\r\n\r\nBranches  or  not. What have we to do with  it?  We\r\n\r\ncame  here  thinking that the Government  wanted  a\r\n\r\nvote  of  confidence from the House  to  strengthen\r\n\r\ntheir hand in working for the security and peace of\r\n\r\nthe State of Singapore and its people. We came here\r\n\r\nprepared  to support the Government in  this  fight\r\n\r\nagainst Communist subversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  today  the  Prime Minister in his  speech  has\r\n\r\nstated  categorically that the Government does  not\r\n\r\nintend  to do this. He has said that when there  is\r\n\r\ntrouble  from the Communists he will hand  over  to\r\n\r\nthe  British  and  it is up to them  to  fight  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  Then  why does the Government  want  a\r\n\r\nvote of confidence today?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said before, Sir, and I say it now, that\r\n\r\nwhenever  the P.A.P. Government finds itself  in  a\r\n\r\ndifficult  spot they try to confuse  not  only  the\r\n\r\nOpposition but also the public. They can no  longer\r\n\r\ndeny it now. The position is clearly this. Some  or\r\n\r\nmany  of the P.A.P. Back-benchers and Party members\r\n\r\nwanted  a  meeting of the 51 Branches.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  refused to convene it. This  issue  has\r\n\r\nbeen  clouded by the motion before the House today.\r\n\r\nWith due respect to you, Sir, actually we would  be\r\n\r\nvoting on the issue whether we think the Government\r\n\r\nis  right in not convening this meeting or  whether\r\n\r\nthe   Back-benchers  are  right  in  demanding  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  and  the  Government should  convene  this\r\n\r\nmeeting.  That was what all the speeches are  about\r\n\r\ntoday.  If  we  vote with the Government,  then  we\r\n\r\nagree that the Government is right; and if we  vote\r\n\r\nagainst the Government, then we agree that the\r\n\r\nBack-benchers are right. Let us not be confused, Sir. We\r\n\r\nshall  not be voting, as the Prime Minister's fairy\r\n\r\ntale  tried to make it appear to be, on  the  issue\r\n\r\nwhether  we  have  confidence  in  a  non-Communist\r\n\r\nGovernment   or  whether  we  would   rather   have\r\n\r\nSingapore  handed over to the Communists.  That  is\r\n\r\nnot  the issue. We will not be voting on that.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister tried to make it a  \"Heads  I  win,\r\n\r\ntails  you  lose\"  affair.  If  we  vote  for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, they win. If we vote against  them,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister's fairy tale tried to make  it,\r\n\r\nwe are siding with the pro-Communist faction. So we\r\n\r\nlose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, Sir, it appears as, though it\r\n\r\nmight  be wise for us to abstain. But we feel  very\r\n\r\nstrongly  that the confidence the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nwon  in 1959 no longer holds, as has been shown  in\r\n\r\nthe results of the by-elections in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHong  Lim and Anson. The Alliance Opposition,  Sir,\r\n\r\nis not at all surprised that the people of Hong Lim\r\n\r\nand  Anson have rejected the P.A.P. Government.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  have said it before that the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I repeat, Sir, Singapore, not  only  of\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  and Anson, have lost confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government. And why should  they  not?  How\r\n\r\nhave  they  benefited during the two years  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. government? You will recall, Sir, at the end\r\n\r\nof  one year of P.A.P. Government, I tabled several\r\n\r\nquestions. One of them was how many houses they had\r\n\r\nbuilt.  The  answer  was 125 as compared  with  the\r\n\r\nfigures  I gave - I forgot the exact figures  - 3,000\r\n\r\nodd built by the previous Government in their first\r\n\r\nyear;  6,000-odd built not only by the  Government,\r\n\r\nbut  by  the  whole State during that  first  year.\r\n\r\nDuring  the  first  year of the P.A.P.  Government,\r\n\r\nthere  were  only 125 houses built. And  what  they\r\n\r\nhave  completed of S.I.T. flats, the rents are much\r\n\r\nhigher  than  what  the  previous  Government   was\r\n\r\ncharging. Unemployment has increased and  this  has\r\n\r\nled to increased robberies and crimes. The standard\r\n\r\nof  living has gone down. The standard of education\r\n\r\nhas  gone  down. The medical services have suffered\r\n\r\ndeplorably.  People  have  been  deprived  of   the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of speech. This has now been confirmed  by\r\n\r\nthe Back-benchers themselves - an accusation that  we\r\n\r\nhave made before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a hundred and one legitimate\r\n\r\nreasons  to  prove  that the  electorate  has  lost\r\n\r\nconfidence in the Government. In view of  this,  we\r\n\r\nhave no alternative but to vote against the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was amused when the Member for Bras Basah said\r\n\r\nthat  because it is a one man one vote system,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. cannot adopt what she called  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment's \"tactics\". I suppose she was referring\r\n\r\nto  the arrest of the subversives. But she said the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have what she called \"tricks\". I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether  the translation was right. She  called  it\r\n\r\n\"tricks\"  to deal with these people. I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhat \"tricks\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshe  was  referring  to, is it the  appointment  of\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretaries and paying them $1,100  each?\r\n\r\nI  do not know. She knows best what tricks she  was\r\n\r\nreferring to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second one amused me more. I just happened to\r\n\r\nhear,  when I came in, that she was scolded by  all\r\n\r\nthe  others - presumably they were mostly men. May  I\r\n\r\nbe  so  bold as to venture In suggest that she  was\r\n\r\nscolded by them, because she was a woman? Maybe!  I\r\n\r\nsay  this because I happen to know that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not believe in giving women  equal\r\n\r\nprivileges. On several occasions when I happened to\r\n\r\nmention  equal privileges for women,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  mocked  me and  said  that  while  he\r\n\r\nbelieved  that all men are equal, he believed  also\r\n\r\nthat  some men are more equal than others.  As  for\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Pasir Panjang, he  gave  a  clear\r\n\r\npicture  of what the P.A.P.'s idea of equality  for\r\n\r\nwomen  means.  Equal work, equal  trouble  but  not\r\n\r\nequal benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to make one\r\n\r\nobservation;  many people have been  wondering  why\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. have released the detainees,  and  why\r\n\r\nthey  have  employed them as Political Secretaries.\r\n\r\nCould it be that the previous Government had made a\r\n\r\ndeplorable mistake in arresting innocent men? Could\r\n\r\nit  be  that the present Government have found  out\r\n\r\nthat  they  had  been  wrongly  arrested  and  that\r\n\r\ninjustice  had been done to them; and so they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  rewarded  with a good post of $1,100?  People\r\n\r\nhave  been  wondering, but today their doubts  have\r\n\r\nbeen   cleared.  The  Prime  Minister  stated  very\r\n\r\nclearly that they were Communists. He admitted they\r\n\r\nwere  Communists.  So they were  rightly  detained.\r\n\r\nAnyway,  that  does not seem to solve the  problem,\r\n\r\nSir.  That  deepens the mystery. If they knew  they\r\n\r\nwere  Communists or Communist leaders or  Communist\r\n\r\nfriends, or whatever term they used, why then  were\r\n\r\nthey  employed? Why then are public funds  used  to\r\n\r\npay them? As this fact is public knowledge now, why\r\n\r\nare  public funds still being used to pay them? The\r\n\r\nmystery  seems  to deepen, Sir. The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas given the answer! The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic  are  still wondering why this is  continued\r\n\r\nafter the explanation has been given. I would  love\r\n\r\nto  see the reaction on their faces when they  read\r\n\r\nthe  papers tomorrow, Sir, that the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsays the reason why they were released was that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. did not intend to take repressive  measures\r\n\r\nagainst  the Communists. Their duty is to  preserve\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  They  did mention that  they  did  not\r\n\r\nintend  to  take  repressive  action  against   the\r\n\r\nCommunists for the sake of the British. Their  duty\r\n\r\nis to preserve the P.A.P. Speaking on behalf of the\r\n\r\nAlliance Opposition, Sir, may I say that the policy\r\n\r\nof  the  Alliance  is to preserve  the  State  even\r\n\r\nbefore the Party?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nhave been summoned to this sitting - I should say  it\r\n\r\nis  through no fault of yours - at such short  notice\r\n\r\nto  decide whether this Government should  stay  or\r\n\r\nquit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is apparent from the speeches of those on the\r\n\r\nGovernment  benches that there have  been  troubles\r\n\r\nand problems among themselves and that we have been\r\n\r\ncalled here today so that this Assembly can be used\r\n\r\nas  an  instrument by the present  leaders  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to resolve their problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today's sitting should actually have been\r\n\r\nheld either in the People's Association's centre at\r\n\r\nKallang  Airport  or  in the cultural  centre  with\r\n\r\nperhaps  a  different Chairman. But  we  have  been\r\n\r\nasked  to  come  here  today and  we  feel  we  are\r\n\r\nattending   more   as  observers   and   spectators\r\n\r\nattending  a  conference of  P.A.P. members  at  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. conference. Sir, it is my view and that  of\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues that the best place to  resolve  the\r\n\r\nproblems  faced  by the P.A.P. leadership  and  the\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the  Government is within  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the issues brought out during the past\r\n\r\nfew  weeks between the P.A.P. Back-benchers and the\r\n\r\nFront-benchers are not new to us. They were brought\r\n\r\nup more than a year ago when the Hong Lim Branch of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. submitted 16 resolutions to the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership.  Most of the speeches made  today  have\r\n\r\nnothing new in substance. I am sure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have heard them many times in this same Chamber\r\n\r\nwhen  a  year ago the Government leaders sought  to\r\n\r\nvindicate  themselves  in the  P.A.P. by  bringing\r\n\r\nP.A.P. issues into this same Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a year ago we pointed out that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership   had  departed  from  the  spirit   and\r\n\r\nmanifesto of the P.A.P., and from the firm  resolve\r\n\r\nand  anti-colonial stand of the P.A.P.  It  was  in\r\n\r\nJune  last  year that the Hong Lim  Branch  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. first  raised the banner of revolt  against\r\n\r\nthe   present  P.A.P. leadership  when  it  sought\r\n\r\nrectification of the mistakes and blunders  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leaders  within the  inner  confines  of  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. conference. Sir, it has  been  a  long  and\r\n\r\ntortuous  journey for many of us, but we  are  glad\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  vindicated the political  questions\r\n\r\nraised in the Hong Lim resolutions during the  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  by-election.  We are also happy  to  say  here\r\n\r\ntoday  that we are gaining wider and wider  support\r\n\r\non those vital questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is interesting to note that it was after\r\n\r\nthe catastrophic defeat of the P.A.P. leadership in\r\n\r\nthe  crucial Hong Lim by-election that the  present\r\n\r\npattern   of  conflict  within  the  P.A.P. first\r\n\r\nunfolded itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>00.01 a.m., 21st July, 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should not try to go too much into details\r\n\r\nbecause we are not P.A.P. members any more. Perhaps\r\n\r\nmany  will join us later on this side of the House!\r\n\r\nBut  in the by-election in Hong Lim, we did not ask\r\n\r\nfor  a  mandate  from  the people  calling  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to quit, for it was our belief  that  it\r\n\r\nwas  not  in  the interest of the country  to  have\r\n\r\ngeneral   elections  so  soon  after  the   general\r\n\r\nelections  in  1959. What we did was  to  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to rectify its mistakes and we sought  a\r\n\r\nmandate  that  we  shall be here  as  watchdogs  on\r\n\r\nGovernment's policies, that we shall support  those\r\n\r\npolicies  which are in the interest of the  people,\r\n\r\nand  that  we will oppose those policies which  are\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the interest of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is our view that this Assembly must not be\r\n\r\nused   as  an  instrument  to  resolve  intra-party\r\n\r\nconflicts or personal conflicts other than those of\r\n\r\na political\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnature.  Sir,  only political issues that  are  the\r\n\r\nsubject of public controversy and of public  import\r\n\r\nshould  be  brought to this Chamber. Now  that  the\r\n\r\nbattle  for Hong Lim and Anson is over, it is  high\r\n\r\ntime  that the P.A.P. Government settled  down  and\r\n\r\ndid  some strenuous work for the pay they have been\r\n\r\ncollecting  every month from the  public  purse  to\r\n\r\nbetter  the  welfare  and  the  livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\noverwhelming masses of the people. They should make\r\n\r\nan   attempt   to  tackle  many  of  the   problems\r\n\r\nconfronting us. It is not in the national  interest\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government  to precipitate  crisis  after\r\n\r\ncrisis, for it would be the poverty stricken masses\r\n\r\nand the people who would be made to suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is nothing to prevent this Government\r\n\r\nfrom  carrying on. As far as I know, no  Member  on\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  has  questioned  the  Government's\r\n\r\nauthority to carry on. Perhaps the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nhas  asked  the Prime Minister to resign  from  the\r\n\r\nParty.  He has not asked the Government to  resign.\r\n\r\nBut  at today's sitting, we have been asked to give\r\n\r\nblanket  approval for all Government's actions  and\r\n\r\npolicies,  whether in the past or in  the  possible\r\n\r\nfuture.  Sir,  we  are afraid we cannot  give  such\r\n\r\nblanket  approval.  We  have  been  asked  to  give\r\n\r\nGovernment a blank cheque, and today we  shall  not\r\n\r\ngive it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>00.05 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, when the time came  for  holding\r\n\r\nthe  by-election in Anson, the P.A.P. nominated its\r\n\r\ncandidate, Inche Mahmud bin Awang, in his  capacity\r\n\r\nas  the President of the T.U.C. to contest the  \r\n\r\nby-election.  Since the by-election campaign  started,\r\n\r\nsome  of the T.U.C. leaders, numbering six in  all.\r\n\r\nled by Mr Lim Ching Siong, took the opportunity of\r\n\r\nraising many issues in the newspapers with the sole\r\n\r\nobject of bringing about the defeat of Inche Mahmud\r\n\r\nbin Awang in the by-election. This was obvious. Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Ching  Siong and his friends know  that  Inche\r\n\r\nMahmud  bin  Awang  is  a  leader  of  the  workers\r\n\r\nmovement and a friend to them in the T.U.C. But the\r\n\r\nactions of Mr Lim Ching Siong and his friends were\r\n\r\nacts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  treachery,  because, as the  Treasurer  in  the\r\n\r\nAnson by-election, I could see and understand  very\r\n\r\nwell,  with  my clear thinking as the Secretary  of\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C., the move taken by Mr Lim Ching  Siong\r\n\r\nand  his colleagues. They did not stop there.  That\r\n\r\nwas  followed by eight Assemblymen who  put  out  a\r\n\r\njoint  statement  in  the newspapers  opposing  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Possibly they were influenced  by  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong  or  by  the  propaganda  and  tactics\r\n\r\nadopted  by  him. As a result of this,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nheld  a  meeting of Assemblymen at which a decision\r\n\r\nwas  taken  and agreed to by a majority  vote  that\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  should not issue public statements  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  political matters. It is a matter  for\r\n\r\nregret  that  eight Assemblymen have flouted  party\r\n\r\ndiscipline,  which  is  tantamount  to  an  act  of\r\n\r\ntreachery towards the Party. They issued  a  public\r\n\r\nstatement two days before Polling Day. What was the\r\n\r\nmotive  then  behind  the  release  of  the   joint\r\n\r\nstatement  of  the eight Assemblymen  and  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing Siong and his colleagues?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,I have been active in the labour\r\n\r\nmovement. I have been a colleague of Mr Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong  and  the  two  of  us  together  have  faced\r\n\r\nhardships. I understand the tactics adopted by  Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Ching  Siong and his friends were  responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the  defeat  of  the P.A.P. candidate,  Inche\r\n\r\nMahmud  bin Awang. He was suddenly stabbed  in  the\r\n\r\nback by his close friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nstate  that I wholeheartedly support the motion  of\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>00.10 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in the debate on the\r\n\r\nmotion  moved by the Prime Minister, many  Members,\r\n\r\nboth  of the Government and of the Opposition, have\r\n\r\nexpressed their views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a bit late for this afternoon's sitting and\r\n\r\nwhen  I  came  in,  I found a seat  occupied  by  a\r\n\r\n\"military officer's. He stood arrogantly and  spoke\r\n\r\nas a warrior or a hero fighting for the rights\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  man  in Singapore. At the same time, he thumped\r\n\r\nhis  chest over his victory in Anson, as though  it\r\n\r\nwas  of  great significance to him; but  he  forgot\r\n\r\nthat  behind his victory in Anson was an act  which\r\n\r\nwas  condemned by all the people in Singapore. Such\r\n\r\na  dirty  act resulted in his victory and  his \r\n\r\nre-entry  into  this  Chamber, but it  should  not  be\r\n\r\nforgotten  that  this champion of the  masses  once\r\n\r\nchallenged  a  Member to resign  and  when  it  was\r\n\r\naccepted, he fled from the by-election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this motion the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  has  proclaimed  himself  a  hero  in   this\r\n\r\nChamber.  But in the Anson by-election, he  adopted\r\n\r\nmany  mean tactics to achieve victory. On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  P.A.P. repeatedly stated  in  the\r\n\r\nby-election in Anson that the winning or losing of the\r\n\r\nby-election would not be an issue to the Party.  If\r\n\r\nthey were to lose it, they would go down honourably\r\n\r\nand cleanly; and if they were to win it, they would\r\n\r\ndo so likewise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what amazes me is that the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson is making himself out  to  be  a\r\n\r\ngenuine nationalist. He has brought up issues which\r\n\r\nwould  result in disunity amongst the various races\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  Mr Speaker, we should  not  forget\r\n\r\nthat   we   the  people  of  Singapore  are   today\r\n\r\nstruggling  for  the creation of a  united  Malayan\r\n\r\nnation,  with a single national language, a  single\r\n\r\nnational culture, and a single fatherland. But  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  has tried to play  up  communal\r\n\r\nsentiments in order to gain a seat in Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I trust the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary is not now on a platform of the Anson \r\n\r\nby-election!  I  think all his remarks are  completely\r\n\r\nirrelevant  to  the motion. He may  later  on  have\r\n\r\nanother occasion to attack the Member for Anson for\r\n\r\nwhat he did in winning the by-election. But let  us\r\n\r\nget back to the motion before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am not\r\n\r\nspeaking as though I am on an election platform. It\r\n\r\nwas merely to clarify, because the Member for Anson\r\n\r\njust  now  thumped his chest over his  victory  and\r\n\r\nsaid indirectly that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  alone  is  the fighter for mankind.  So  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for me to expose whether  there  is  any\r\n\r\ntruth  in the statement made just now by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, there is close connection\r\n\r\nbetween his victory and the motion before us  moved\r\n\r\nin  the name of the Prime Minister, because we  are\r\n\r\nnow  faced  with trials and challenges from  forces\r\n\r\nwhich are against national unity in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Anson dwelt on communalism and said that\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  should  not  forget  their  ancestral\r\n\r\nculture, as also on their part the Indians and  the\r\n\r\nMalays, it  is as clear as daylight that  communal\r\n\r\nsentiments  are being worked up when we are  making\r\n\r\nall-out efforts to create a national culture \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  must  take regard of comments  from  the\r\n\r\nChair.  I  do  not  remember the Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nmentioning anything about communalism in his speech\r\n\r\nin this Chamber. Let us try to keep to the rails as\r\n\r\nfar as possible. Time is getting on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, that\r\n\r\nrepresents the tail-piece of the election  speeches\r\n\r\nmade  in  Anson.  I  am not saying  that  you,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, are not giving me freedom, but in order to\r\n\r\nconserve time I will adhere to your ruling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the issue now is that the people of Singapore, who are anti-colonialists, should\r\n\r\nconsolidate Left-wing unity. Mr Speaker,  what  is\r\n\r\nmeant  by  \"unity\"? \"Unity\" can be  interpreted  in\r\n\r\nmany  ways.  I will give a number of illustrations.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker. For example, there are many kinds  of\r\n\r\nanimals living in the forest. When the forest is on\r\n\r\nfire,  the animals take flight to save their skins.\r\n\r\nAt  that time the tiger forgets the deer; the snake\r\n\r\nforgets the frog. Although they are enemies, common\r\n\r\ninterest  dictates that they should flee  from  the\r\n\r\nfire. After the fire is over and everything is back\r\n\r\nto  normal,  they will then get together.  What  is\r\n\r\nunity  to  make a broom when the broom is  used  by\r\n\r\npeople who have no real use for it? Or is unity  to\r\n\r\nmix cucumber with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndurians in one basket, which is impossible?  It  is\r\n\r\nnot possible for the durians and the cucumber to be\r\n\r\nput in one basket without first removing the thorns\r\n\r\nfrom  the  durians. It will not  be  safe  for  the\r\n\r\ncucumber to be mixed with the durians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have given several definitions of unity. In attempting to seek unity, we should\r\n\r\nrealise  that  the  P.A.P. has clearly  stated  its\r\n\r\nstand-  that  it  is fighting for  an  independent,\r\n\r\ndemocratic,   socialist,   non-Communist    Malaya.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have been challenged by certain groups,\r\n\r\nwe have repeatedly stated our unequivocal stand. If\r\n\r\nwe  take an anti-Communist stand, it means we  will\r\n\r\ngo into the Western bloc; if, on the other hand, we\r\n\r\nadopt  a pro-Communist attitude, we will be  horses\r\n\r\nfor the Communists to ride on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has had occasion to say that in fighting for the interests of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we,  as socialists and  non-Communists,\r\n\r\nhave  repeated that what is good for the Communists\r\n\r\nmay  not be good for us; what is good for them  may\r\n\r\nalso  be good for us; and what is not good  for  us\r\n\r\nmay also be not good for them. But what is good for\r\n\r\nus, although it is bad for them, we will use in our\r\n\r\ninterests  even if we have to fight them.  This  is\r\n\r\nclear from the speeches on the policy of the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we ask ourselves, Mr Speaker, is it true that\r\n\r\nwe  are retreating? Suppose we are faced with  four\r\n\r\nor  five enemies in front and there are friends  at\r\n\r\nour  backs with a hammer. In trying to evade  blows\r\n\r\nfrom  the enemies, if we turn round to our  friends\r\n\r\nit  will mean that we are giving an opportunity  to\r\n\r\nour  enemies in front to hit us. Such  an  act  is\r\n\r\neven  more treacherous than stabbing from the back,\r\n\r\nbecause stabbing from the back means that it is  an\r\n\r\nact of so-called friends who are traitors. This act\r\n\r\ngives  an  opportunity to our enemies to  kill  us.\r\n\r\nThis happened with the group of people who claim to\r\n\r\nbe  fighters of the labour movement - Lim Ching Siong\r\n\r\nand  his  friends who have lulled the  masses  with\r\n\r\nsweet music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLim  Ching  Siong  and  his  friends  are  able  to\r\n\r\ninfluence  certain members of the P.A.P. with  the\r\n\r\nresult that these members dance to their tune. They\r\n\r\nhave  forgotten themselves and have started to wash\r\n\r\ndirty  linen in public, which they should do within\r\n\r\nthe  Party, to show that they are the real fighters\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  This also is  a  treacherous  act\r\n\r\ncommitted toward the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in facing this problem, we should understand the real meaning of unity, and this\r\n\r\nmotion has been moved by the Prime Minister not  on\r\n\r\nour  bended  knees to the Opposition to seek  their\r\n\r\nsupport.  If the people feel that we have  betrayed\r\n\r\ntheir  trust, they will be able to judge  our  acts\r\n\r\nand our deeds on this motion. Briefly, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nin  the interests of national unity, it is vital to\r\n\r\ncreate   a  single  united  nation  with  a  single\r\n\r\nculture, and a single national language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the motion moved by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>00.30 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

In\r\n\r\nprinciple,  I regret I cannot give even  point  one\r\n\r\nper cent of my support to the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw your\r\n\r\nattention  to  the new champions.  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  they are new ones, but from my reading  of\r\n\r\nthe  papers I notice they are making a lot of noise\r\n\r\nin  the  Assembly  to  hit at the  Government.  But\r\n\r\ntonight I can say that these people in the Assembly\r\n\r\ntoday  are not true champions of the people. In  my\r\n\r\nview, they have been wrongly chosen to sit in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I give my sympathy to the Member for Anson who has just joined us in this Assembly. I do\r\n\r\nnot  like  to hit out at him. But I would  like  to\r\n\r\ngive  my  views  on various matters raised  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech  in  this Assembly. I feel the Member  could\r\n\r\nnot  have fathomed the true feelings of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore and the feelings of the  people  from\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. if my father in the Federation  is  being\r\n\r\nopposed, the son would now like to take issue  with\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson on matters that he has raised\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly. Before he goes any  further,  I\r\n\r\nhope  he  can  see ahead. Probably  he  cannot  see\r\n\r\nwhether  or not there is a wall behind him.  But  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge him to look ahead. If there is a leader\r\n\r\nof  a  political party who says that he  wishes  to\r\n\r\nbring  about  the independence of Singapore  within\r\n\r\nthe  jurisdiction of the United Nations, I am sorry\r\n\r\nto  say.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that he has  forgotten\r\n\r\nthis.  He  should  always  remember  that  although\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. may  not  have  many  members   in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  yet  U.M.N.O. has  a  very  clear  voice\r\n\r\noutside the Assembly to speak to people who wish to\r\n\r\nbring independence to Singapore. We Malays-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Members have been speaking a bit\r\n\r\nloudly in this Chamber, but I think the Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan wins the first  prize!  Will  he\r\n\r\nplease modulate his voice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I beg your indulgence,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is  clearly\r\n\r\nstated  in the Constitution of Singapore  that  we,\r\n\r\nthe  indigenous people, have certain clear  rights.\r\n\r\nWe  are  not willing to be under the administration\r\n\r\nof the United Nations, or under the tutelage of the\r\n\r\nUnited   Nations;  nor  do  we   wish   to   become\r\n\r\nindependent without merger with the Federation.  So\r\n\r\nthis  is one of the views expressed by one  of  the\r\n\r\nSons  of Tunku Abdul Rahman on behalf of the people\r\n\r\nof the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I come back to the P.A.P. I\r\n\r\nam  amazed that after two years it is only now that\r\n\r\nI  am  aware that there is no democracy within  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  I do not blame the Ministers on the  \r\n\r\nFront-bench.  But I blame the people on the Back-benches.\r\n\r\nIf  indeed  they know that the Party has  not  been\r\n\r\npractising  democracy, why is  it  that  they  have\r\n\r\ntolerated  it  for  two years until  their  Members\r\n\r\nrebel  against  the  Government,  whether  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  or outside? I do not like to regard  them\r\n\r\nas  robots.  I am sure it is not so in  the  Party,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  always speak with great  pride  that\r\n\r\nthey  have been elected by the people. Five Members\r\n\r\nare  going out and it seems the party is tottering.\r\n\r\nSo,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, after two years  there  now\r\n\r\ncomes a statement from the Federation for a plan to\r\n\r\nbring  about a merger, and it is then that  we  see\r\n\r\nthe  true  state of affairs existing in the  Party.\r\n\r\nWhen I stood up to speak about the Communists, they\r\n\r\nwould hit back at me right and left. But now it  is\r\n\r\nup  to the people of Singapore to see whether there\r\n\r\nare  any  Communists within the  Party.  If  indeed\r\n\r\nthere  are Communists in the People's Action Party,\r\n\r\nwhy is it that the Minister for Home Affairs allows\r\n\r\nthese people to go free without detaining them? Why\r\n\r\ndo  they harbour Communists? Why do they give  them\r\n\r\nsalaries of $1,100 a month? Why should these people\r\n\r\nbe harboured if they know that they are Communists?\r\n\r\nWhy  should they not arrest them and send  them  to\r\n\r\nPulau  Senang, or wherever it may be? The stand  of\r\n\r\nthe Alliance is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanti-Communist. We are indeed surprised that  these\r\n\r\nmatters exist within the P.A.P. I really feel  that\r\n\r\nif this is so, then the aims of the P.A.P. to carry\r\n\r\nout  its  policies  and its ideology  will  not  be\r\n\r\nachieved.  Mr  Speaker, when the Tunku  wanted  to\r\n\r\ncreate  a  Greater  Malaysia or a  Happy  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthere arose not only from among the P.A.P. but also\r\n\r\nfrom among the Opposition support that the Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council should be abolished. I cannot give\r\n\r\na  guarantee, and I dare not give such a guarantee,\r\n\r\nto  anyone that if the Internal Security Council is\r\n\r\nabolished     from     the     Constitution      of\r\n\r\nSingapore - perhaps you yourself, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwill  see - I do not know what will happen. If  there\r\n\r\nis no internal Security Council, it would mean that\r\n\r\nthe  troops  of  the British and the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya cannot take a great deal of interest in  the\r\n\r\ninternal affairs of the State. If it is the  belief\r\n\r\nof the people within the People's Action Party that\r\n\r\nwe  do  not require British forces, that we do  not\r\n\r\nrequire  the  forces  of  the  Federation  to  help\r\n\r\nsafeguard  our  security, if the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  is abolished, then I believe, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nA.R.T.I.S. in its biggest form and its worst  form\r\n\r\nwill  come into being and we cannot fight them.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is  no internal Security Council,  it  means\r\n\r\nthat the Communists will have things their own way.\r\n\r\nThen  I  fear  there  will be  bloodshed.  This  is\r\n\r\ntotally undesirable in the State of Singapore.  So.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I  hope,  and  I  particularly\r\n\r\naddress  my  hope to them, that the Ministers  will\r\n\r\nassume   the   responsibility  to  overcome   their\r\n\r\ndomestic  difficulties without calling upon  us  to\r\n\r\nhelp  then,. By all means, wipe out all the  people\r\n\r\nwithin  their  ranks  who are undesirable  so  that\r\n\r\nSingapore will become prosperous and peaceful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nclarified  his  intention  of  a  merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  with special emphasis on education  and\r\n\r\nlabour  policies. But I can say that such a  policy\r\n\r\nwill  not easily be agreed to. I would like to draw\r\n\r\nthe   attention   of  the  Hon. the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for National Development that  if\r\n\r\nthe  mosquito net is ridden with bed-bugs, then let\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition Members not be asked to  help  them\r\n\r\nclear these pests without their being besmirched by\r\n\r\nthe blood of the bed-bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>00.45 am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it\r\n\r\nis with sadness that in two years this is the first\r\n\r\ntime  I have failed in my duty as a whip, but  that\r\n\r\nis not within my power. It is easy to whip when you\r\n\r\nhave  only the Front-bench and the Back-bench.  But\r\n\r\nit is very difficult to use your whip when there is\r\n\r\nthe  Front-bench, the Back-bench and also the\r\n\r\nstab-in-the-back  Back-benchers. I have been  instructed\r\n\r\nby  the  Leader of the House that tonight's  debate\r\n\r\nwill be a free-for-all. Each one votes according to\r\n\r\nhis conscience. So the whip is withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was not my intention to say\r\n\r\nanything tonight, had it not been for the fact that\r\n\r\nsome  of  our  friends were trying  to  accuse  the\r\n\r\nleaders  of trying to bribe us, even to the  extent\r\n\r\nof  saying  bribing  with money,  to  stay  in  the\r\n\r\ngovernment.  The  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Health  talked  of   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy, but I would have thought that, according\r\n\r\nto the rules of parliamentary democracy, anyone who\r\n\r\ndisagrees with Government policy or with Government\r\n\r\nleadership  should  have  the  decency   to   speak\r\n\r\nopposite  us.  They should have crossed  the  Floor\r\n\r\nbefore they attacked the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs talked of party discipline. He said\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. was the best organised and the best\r\n\r\ndisciplined Party. That was no doubt a fact,  until\r\n\r\nthe statement issued by the eight Assemblymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my duty to draw your\r\n\r\nattention  to  the fact that some months  ago,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Pasir Panjang wrote an  article  in  a\r\n\r\nmagazine  without  consulting  the  Party   Central\r\n\r\nExecutive Committee saying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we  should fight for complete internal  \r\n\r\nself-government  in our next negotiations  with  London.\r\n\r\nAfter  that, as a Whip, I told him that  he  should\r\n\r\nhave consulted the Party before deciding policy for\r\n\r\nthe  Party.  Later on, the Member for Thomson  also\r\n\r\nissued  a  statement  with  other  trade  unionists\r\n\r\nattacking the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had an Assemblymen's meeting before Anson and\r\n\r\nwe  reached  a  decision by secret ballot  that  no\r\n\r\nstatement  should be issued by any  Assemblyman  to\r\n\r\nthe  Press  on matters of policy. So  if  there  is\r\n\r\nanyone who is fit to talk of party discipline,  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs should be the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs and the Member for Toa Payoh are\r\n\r\nmembers  of  a  Committee of Review  on  party  and\r\n\r\ngovernment work. We have to admit that we  realised\r\n\r\nthat we had to rectify many of our mistakes both in\r\n\r\ngovernment and in party organisation after the Hong\r\n\r\nLim  by-election, and we formed this  Committee  of\r\n\r\nReview  to look into the mistakes and to  make  the\r\n\r\nnecessary    rectifications.   The    Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Home Affairs is Joint\r\n\r\nSecretary with myself in this Committee of  Review.\r\n\r\nHe  knows full well that we have received memoranda\r\n\r\nfrom  all  the  Branches with good  recommendations\r\n\r\nabout  intra-party democracy and  about  rectifying\r\n\r\nour  mistakes in many affairs. In fact, an  interim\r\n\r\nreport  has been prepared for adoption  by  a  full\r\n\r\nAssemblymen's  meeting. If that is not  intra-party\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  then  I  do not know  what  intra-party\r\n\r\ndemocracy means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why could they not wait for another 48 hours to\r\n\r\nissue  the  statement? Why did they talk of \r\n\r\nintra-party democracy when we were fighting the battle in\r\n\r\nAnson? Why did they not raise the question of \r\n\r\nintra-party democracy then? Why did they not support  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim when he raised the question  of\r\n\r\nintra-party  democracy  during  the  Hong  Lim \r\n\r\nby-election?  If they know and if they were  convinced\r\n\r\nthat  there  was  no  intra-party  democracy,  they\r\n\r\nshould have crossed the Floor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the Member for Hong Lim. Instead, they  spoke\r\n\r\nsolidly behind us during the by-election. They said\r\n\r\nhow good the Party was. For two years we have never\r\n\r\nheard  a  word about intra-party democracy in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  The  statement about intra-party  democracy\r\n\r\ncame  only  after  our Chairman had  announced  our\r\n\r\nacceptance  in principle of a merger. That  was  in\r\n\r\nthe Hokkien Huay Kuan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the Member for Hong Lim also raised the\r\n\r\nquestion  of political detainees in this  House.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  remember  any  of our Back-benchers  having\r\n\r\nspoken  on that motion.

It seeks the confidence  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  in the Government. But the intention  behind\r\n\r\nthe  motion and its implications are not clear,  It\r\n\r\nis  our  duty  as  elected representatives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  to remember now more than ever before  that\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the people are paramount and  not\r\n\r\nthose  of  individual political  leaders  who  have\r\n\r\npawned their principles in desperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is our responsibility to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  dispassionately the  motion  and  put  the\r\n\r\nunderlying issues in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  proper  perspective so  that  the  people  may\r\n\r\ncorrectly  judge them. We must expose any  plot  to\r\n\r\nconfuse and mislead the people. Sir, there are  two\r\n\r\nbasic questions we must answer honestly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. For whom is the confidence vote sought; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. For what purpose is it sought?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government referred to in the motion\r\n\r\ntechnically  means the Cabinet  led  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  who  is  the Secretary-General  and  the\r\n\r\nleader  of  the  People's  Action  Party.  All  the\r\n\r\nMinisters are in the Central Executive Committee of\r\n\r\nthe  Party and they constitute a dominant majority.\r\n\r\nFor  all practical purposes, therefore, the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nCabinet means the leadership of the P.A.P. In other\r\n\r\nwords,  Sir,  today  in  this  House,  a  vote   of\r\n\r\nconfidence  is  asked  for the  leadership  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  That  is the basic position that  we  must\r\n\r\nmake clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, Sir, in his speech has brought\r\n\r\nout  three points which I consider to be major.  He\r\n\r\nsaid,  one, the six trade unionists and  the  eight\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  oppose  merger;  two,   there   is   a\r\n\r\nCommunist move to capture the Party and to  capture\r\n\r\nthe  Government;  and three, the  overriding  smear\r\n\r\nthat  these  people termed Communists are  actually\r\n\r\nfriends of the British.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is too silly and absurd a remark\r\n\r\nto   make,   that  these  people  who  are   called\r\n\r\nCommunists are also colonial stooges, and therefore\r\n\r\nit does not warrant any serious consideration. I do\r\n\r\nnot  see  how the Prime Minister seeks to  make  it\r\n\r\nlook  congruous by saying, on one side, these  are\r\n\r\nCommunist front men and on the other side they  are\r\n\r\nfriends of the British.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!--Mr K.

Sir, an awareness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  this  failure of the leadership to command  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the people and the comrades in the Party\r\n\r\nhas  caused  a  great  sense  of  desperation,  and\r\n\r\ndesperate men are now preparing to act in desperate\r\n\r\nways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion before the House is a preparation\r\n\r\nfor  a purge. Once the sham confidence is obtained,\r\n\r\nit is possible that some people will be arrested in\r\n\r\nthe  hope of provoking the workers, which, in turn,\r\n\r\nthey  hope,  will provide an excuse for a  complete\r\n\r\nclean-up. Sir, it is clear that the Communist smear\r\n\r\nand  the anti-merger smear are but parts of a  plot\r\n\r\nto prepare anti-democratic and oppressive measures.\r\n\r\nThe  transparency  of this smear  is  obvious, its\r\n\r\nobjective  of  preparing the way  for  a  purge  is\r\n\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not unused to these smears. It is not\r\n\r\nthe  first  time that people like Lim Ching  Siong,\r\n\r\nFong  Swee  Suan, S. Woodhull and the rest  in  the\r\n\r\nunions  have  been called Communists. I  think  the\r\n\r\npeople are aware how the previous Government, under\r\n\r\nthe  leadership of the Member for Cairnhill, called\r\n\r\neven our present Prime Minister a Communist. Smears\r\n\r\nare easy to be created. The calling of names can be\r\n\r\ndone  quite  easily, but this does not resolve  the\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the anti-merger smear. Sir, the\r\n\r\nsix trade unionists have issued up to date but four\r\n\r\nstatements.  There  is  not one  single  word,  one\r\n\r\nsingle phrase, or one single sentence which says we\r\n\r\noppose merger. I shall be much obliged, Sir, if the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  can  quote  any  part  of   their\r\n\r\nstatements  or  any  part  of  any  one  of   their\r\n\r\nstatements, or for that matter, any speech made  by\r\n\r\nany one of us which contains a phrase or a sentence\r\n\r\nopposing  merger. The big lie is that we have  made\r\n\r\nminimum constitutional demands for 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am not quite certain whether\r\n\r\nI  have  heard  the  word  \"lie\"  being  used  with\r\n\r\nreference to a Member of the Assembly.

My understanding of that\r\n\r\nremark  was  that  it had reference  to  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's speech. If it did not have any reference\r\n\r\nto the Prime Minister's speech, then, of course, it\r\n\r\nis  in order. But will the Member assure me that it\r\n\r\nhad no reference to the Prime Minister's speech?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I withdraw the word lie\", Sir, I\r\n\r\ncontinue and further, that we have called for \r\n\r\nanti-colonial  measures in order to block  merger.  Sir,\r\n\r\nour position on this is clear and simple. 1963 is a\r\n\r\nconcrete obligation insofar as constitutional talks\r\n\r\ngo.  It  could be superseded by merger, but  surely\r\n\r\nvague   talk  of  merger  cannot  be  regarded   as\r\n\r\nsuperseding  the  obligations of  1963.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  have  taken up positions for  1963  while\r\n\r\nkeeping  an  open mind on merger and confederation.\r\n\r\nOn  the  question of merger, we state categorically\r\n\r\nthat  we do not oppose merger, merger in the  sense\r\n\r\nit  is  a  full-fledged merger, in the  sense  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will become an additional State  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. Insofar as confederation  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, in principle, it is acceptable but it is\r\n\r\npremature to talk about it now because nobody knows\r\n\r\nthe  details. The P.A.P. leadership on 9th June  in\r\n\r\nthe  Hokkien  Huay  Kuan made a  statement  to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that  we  completely  support  the  Tunku's\r\n\r\nMighty Malaysia plan. It was the Prime Minister who\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"I  support a hundred per  cent  the  Mighty\r\n\r\nMalaysia plan.\" Unfortunately, at the moment,  they\r\n\r\nsay,  \"We  welcome  it in principle.\"  We  have  no\r\n\r\nquarrel  with  anybody  who say  they  welcome  the\r\n\r\nconfederation plan in principle. There  is  no  use\r\n\r\ntalking  of  details now because nobody  knows  the\r\n\r\ndetails.  Therefore, Sir, I repeat  here  that  any\r\n\r\ntalk  that  the  six  unionists  or  the  dissident\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Assembly are  people  who  oppose\r\n\r\nmerger is a basic distortion of facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs said that the\r\n\r\nfour  anti-colonial measures demanded  by  the  six\r\n\r\ntrade   unionists  and  endorsed   by   the   eight\r\n\r\nAssemblymen were inconsistent with the  objects  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Sir, I believe he  does  not  have  a\r\n\r\nmandate to say this, because I am quite prepared to\r\n\r\ntake  him on - or for that matter, any other Minister\r\n\r\nor  Party  official who says that  the  four  \r\n\r\nanti-colonial  measures recommended are  not  consistent\r\n\r\nwith the objects of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we subscribe without qualification to the\r\n\r\nobjects of the P.A.P. as contained in clause  2  of\r\n\r\nthe  Party  Constitution. Let  not  the  people  be\r\n\r\nmisled  by  further smears. The four demands:  one,\r\n\r\nthe  release  of detainees - I ask the leadership  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. whether  it  is  consistent  with  the\r\n\r\nobjects  of  the  P.A.P. to release the  detainees;\r\n\r\ntwo, the unification of the trade union movement - is\r\n\r\nit  or is it not consistent with the objects of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.;  three, the granting of citizenship  rights\r\n\r\nto  genuine anti-colonialists - is it or  is  it  not\r\n\r\nconsistent  with  the objects of  the  P.A.P.;  and\r\n\r\nfour,  the  request to allow freedom of the  Press,\r\n\r\nfreedom   of  association  and  assembly - is   that\r\n\r\nconsistent with the objects of the P.A.P.? In  this\r\n\r\nconnection,  I  wish  to  elaborate  on  one  point\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  assembly. Sir, there  was  a  time  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  - although that time  was  perhaps  worse\r\n\r\nthan it is now when - nevertheless trade unions could\r\n\r\nhold  general meetings in places like the Badminton\r\n\r\nHall,  the Victoria Memorial Hall without a  police\r\n\r\npermit so long as the organisation was a registered\r\n\r\none.  If  the meeting was called for the attendance\r\n\r\nof its members, no permit was necessary. But today,\r\n\r\na  permit is necessary to hold a meeting. Why? Sir,\r\n\r\nI  can  quote  examples  of this.  We  have  quoted\r\n\r\nexamples of this on numerous occasions. It  is  not\r\n\r\nmy  intention to take any more of your  time.  Sir,\r\n\r\nbut if and when further examples are necessary,  we\r\n\r\ncan list them down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everybody knows now that not all is well with\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. The Government Benches are divided. The\r\n\r\nParty  is  faced with a serious crisis. Instead  of\r\n\r\nsorting  out  the internal differences  first,  the\r\n\r\nleadership has come here. This is a blatant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattempt  by the leadership to bring internal  party\r\n\r\ndifferences to let the Assembly decide. This is  an\r\n\r\nattempt to make a decision of this House binding on\r\n\r\nthe  Party.  Sir, this is an attempt  to  seek  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the Opposition the reactionary  Right,\r\n\r\nand  the  communal  groups to carry  on  the  fight\r\n\r\nagainst   those   loyal  Party  members   who   are\r\n\r\ndenouncing their leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs said that those of us who talked of  \r\n\r\nintra-party  democracy went to the extent of releasing  a\r\n\r\nletter to the Press before the by-election. Sir,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not doubt the ability of the Minister for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs   to  read  the  letter  and  the  covering\r\n\r\nstatement  and to understand the reasons given  for\r\n\r\nthe release. A letter is sent by eight Assemblymen,\r\n\r\ndated  one Sunday. On Monday morning, the  Chairman\r\n\r\nof the Party received that letter. The letter says,\r\n\r\n\"Please  open  a 51-Branch meeting to  discuss  the\r\n\r\nsituation   arising  out  of  the  six   unionists'\r\n\r\nstatement, to discuss merger, and to discuss\r\n\r\nintra-party  democracy.\" On Monday night, Mr C. V. Devan\r\n\r\nNair  went to the University of Malaya to attend  a\r\n\r\nforum,  and  committed the Party on the  detainees'\r\n\r\nissue and on other issues raised in the letter.  On\r\n\r\nTuesday,  we  received a letter from  the  Chairman\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"We  will  call  a  meeting  at  a  future\r\n\r\nsuitable  date.\" I think it was on a Tuesday  night\r\n\r\nat  an Anson by-election rally that Mr Devan  Nair\r\n\r\nagain  talked of the matters we had raised  in  the\r\n\r\nletter. Sir, I believe any fool ought to know  that\r\n\r\nwe  had  to come out with a letter publicly stating\r\n\r\nour position clearly to the people. We did not want\r\n\r\nto   publish  this  letter.  If  it  had  been  our\r\n\r\nintention  to publish this letter in the Press,  we\r\n\r\ncould  have  done it in the first place.  We  said.\r\n\r\n\"No, it is a confidential letter. Discuss.\" We  got\r\n\r\na  reply  saying,  \"Yes. We will discuss.\"  In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime, the leadership committed the whole Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no extremely grave situation today\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  The leadership  of  the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nfacing  a  grave  situation inside the  Party.  But\r\n\r\nsurely  the  P.A.P. leadership does not  constitute\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  say  we have no confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nleadership  of the Ministers, i.e., the  leadership\r\n\r\nof the Party. The Party rank and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfile  have  no  confidence in the  leadership.  The\r\n\r\nleadership  have  abandoned  their  principles  and\r\n\r\ndeviated  to  the  Right. This is a  question  that\r\n\r\nshould  be discussed inside the Party. On  the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  Sir, the rank and file have been denied  the\r\n\r\nright to discuss the conduct of the leadership, and\r\n\r\non  the  other, attempts are made to  force  us  to\r\n\r\nexpress confidence in the leadership in this House.\r\n\r\nBy  any  standards,  Sir, this  is  base  political\r\n\r\ntrickery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is now an open secret that the\r\n\r\nsincerity of the Party leaders is questioned within\r\n\r\nthe Party. The Party Branches have no confidence in\r\n\r\nthe leadership, and the leadership does not reflect\r\n\r\nthe  views of the majority in the Party. These  are\r\n\r\nfacts.  Let  the  leadership  deny  this.  Let  the\r\n\r\nleadership  have  the courage to call  a  51-Branch\r\n\r\nmeeting.  Sir,  the leadership  of  the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nresponsible  only  to  the  Party.  With  all   due\r\n\r\nrespect,  Sir,  to the integrity of this  House,  I\r\n\r\nmust say that the leadership of the Party cannot be\r\n\r\ntried  here. Let all those non-P.A.P. members  here\r\n\r\nnot  imagine themselves to be the functionaries  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. This House is not a branch office of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Neither is it the P.A.P. headquarters and I am\r\n\r\nsure, Sir, your respected and honourable self  will\r\n\r\nbe unwilling to play the role of a P.A.P. Chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call made by the eight Assembly Members for a\r\n\r\nconference  of the Central Executive Committee  and\r\n\r\nthe   51-Branch  Executives  has  still  not   been\r\n\r\nanswered  by  the leadership. This  call  is  being\r\n\r\nrepeated practically by all the Branches. The  rank\r\n\r\nand  file  demand a conference. The cry for \r\n\r\nintra-party  democracy is echoed by the majority  in  the\r\n\r\nParty.  Yet the leadership has seen fit  to  ignore\r\n\r\nwhat  is just and moral, but has come here  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Opposition to give it a vote of confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Members opposite are\r\n\r\nnot  the  P.A.P. They are not card-carrying members\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. They do not have the moral authority\r\n\r\nto   express   confidence  or  otherwise   in   the\r\n\r\nleadership of a political Party which is faced with\r\n\r\na  domestic  crisis. Sir, the fight is not  between\r\n\r\nwhat  are  termed the non-Communist  Left  and  the\r\n\r\nCommunist Left. The fight is one of democracy in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Party  set-up. The struggle within the  Party,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  one between those loyal to the ideals  of\r\n\r\nthe    Party   and   the   leadership   which   has\r\n\r\nfundamentally  deviated from this. It  is  a  fight\r\n\r\nbetween those who resolutely stand on principles on\r\n\r\nwhich the P.A.P. was overwhelmingly elected by  the\r\n\r\npeople in May 1959 and the leaders of the Party who\r\n\r\nhave sold out the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ours is an intra-party fight against the\r\n\r\nleaders  who  have betrayed the confidence  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  In  this connection, how  does  the  grave\r\n\r\nsituation arise? I say to the Ministers:  You  have\r\n\r\ndone  enough  harm  to the people.  Please  do  not\r\n\r\nprovoke  their  temper. The responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nleadership  is  to seek to resolve  internal  party\r\n\r\ndifferences  within  the  Party  in  a   democratic\r\n\r\nmanner.  It  is  the business of the leadership  to\r\n\r\nanswer  charges, facing them inside the Party,  and\r\n\r\nnot  ignore those who constitute the P.A.P. and run\r\n\r\nto  the  reactionary  forces in the  Opposition - the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. and  the like for a mandate to deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Why has the leadership no courage to  hold\r\n\r\ndemocratic  discussions within the Party?  Why  has\r\n\r\nthe   leadership   not  sought   to   resolve   the\r\n\r\ndifferences   inside  the  Party?   Why   has   the\r\n\r\nleadership  not  convened  a  meeting  of  the   51\r\n\r\nBranches?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, immediately after the Hong Lim by-election,\r\n\r\nthe Party was faced with a major crisis created  by\r\n\r\nthe  leadership - the Government wanted  to  resign.\r\n\r\nThis question was discussed at a conference of  the 51  Branches.\r\n\r\nThe conference rejected the  proposal\r\n\r\nto  resign.  Subsequently a decision was  taken  to\r\n\r\nrectify  the mistakes of the leadership,  to  fight\r\n\r\nthe   Anson   by-election,  hold  another   similar\r\n\r\nconference  after  Anson to review  the  Anson  \r\n\r\nby-election  results,  and to chart  the  future.  The\r\n\r\nmistakes were not rectified. The leadership further\r\n\r\ncommitted  the Party without a mandate.  The  Anson\r\n\r\nelectorate  rejected the Party. Yet  today  when  a\r\n\r\ncall  is made for the convening of this conference,\r\n\r\nthe leadership keeps silent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been insinuations in some of the\r\n\r\nspeeches  made  by  the  Front  Benchers.  All  the\r\n\r\ncriticisms  coming now are not new  to  them.  They\r\n\r\nhave  heard of them before. Sir, the cry for \r\n\r\nintra-party democracy has been inside the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P. ever  since  the Party  came  into  office.\r\n\r\nEveryone  of  us here knows this is  so.  They  say\r\n\r\nthese  are  all  new.  The  call  to  release   the\r\n\r\ndetainees  is not new. The call to unify the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement is not new. Yet, if the  leadership\r\n\r\nthinks  fit to smear, we are quite prepared to  sit\r\n\r\ndown and listen. But we shall not degenerate to the\r\n\r\nlevel  of  calling them names. Sir, the  leadership\r\n\r\nhas  one  remarkable ability, and the one  man  who\r\n\r\nspecialises  in it is the Minister for Culture,  in\r\n\r\ncalling names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, and a few days before, the talk has been of\r\n\r\nthe  Communist Left and the non-Communist Left. Two\r\n\r\nweeks  ago  it was the stand of the national  Left,\r\n\r\nmeaning, of course, the P.A.P. leadership. Sir, the\r\n\r\nnational  Left always reminds me of the nationalist\r\n\r\nLeft in Germany and Italy, Hitler's and Mussolini's\r\n\r\nnationalist Left which had very significant Fascist\r\n\r\ntendencies.  Sir,  this  name-calling  is  becoming\r\n\r\nfarcical. One day we are lunatic Left. Another  day\r\n\r\nwe  are professional political agitators. Then  one\r\n\r\nday  we become fireside revolutionaries, then\r\n\r\nbeer-hall  revolutionaries, revolutionary  lambs;  what\r\n\r\nothers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Never reactionary?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Never reactionary. But colonialist\r\n\r\nstooges, the British colonialist stooges.  Joke  of\r\n\r\nall  jokes! Sir, my point principally is this. When\r\n\r\nthere is no confidence in the leadership within the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  why come to this House to seek a  vote  of\r\n\r\nconfidence from the Opposition? Is it the intention\r\n\r\nof  the leadership to make a decision of this House\r\n\r\nbinding  on the Party? The Whip, Sir, has just  now\r\n\r\nsaid that there will be a meeting called of the  51\r\n\r\nBranches after we have taken a decision here.  They\r\n\r\nwant  to  make this decision binding on the  Party.\r\n\r\nSurely,  Sir, the first thing to do is  to  resolve\r\n\r\nthe   internal   differences   within   the   party\r\n\r\norganisation, and then, if necessary, seek  a  vote\r\n\r\nof confidence in the legislature. A decision of the\r\n\r\nparty  conference  is binding on the  parliamentary\r\n\r\ngroup  of  the  Party.  But the  decision  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  cannot be binding on the  Party.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nchallenge the leadership here and now to  have  the\r\n\r\ncourage to convene a meeting of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Branches  and put to them a vote of  confidence\r\n\r\nmotion  on  the  leadership. Sir,  the  leadership,\r\n\r\nhaving  lost the confidence of the majority in  the\r\n\r\nParty, and having betrayed the people, now seeks to\r\n\r\nconfuse  and  intimidate  the  people.  The   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  talks  in  terms of a  test  of  strength\r\n\r\nbetween  the  non-Communist Left and the  Communist\r\n\r\nLeft.  The six unionists are smeared as being\r\n\r\nanti-merger.  The people are intimidated with  talks  of\r\n\r\nthe   \"many  unpleasant  and  awkward  things   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  have to do in order  to  maintain\r\n\r\npeace  and order\". These are but cheap smears.  The\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  have not  forgotten  similar\r\n\r\nutterances of the former Chief Minister. The people\r\n\r\nhave  not  forgotten the ruthless actions taken  by\r\n\r\nthe  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government  in  the  name   of\r\n\r\nmaintaining peace and order. But it is a pity, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the  present  leadership of  the  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nforgotten the political fate of the S.P.A. and  the\r\n\r\nLiberal Socialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we who are dissatisfied and\r\n\r\ndisgusted with the leadership of the Government and\r\n\r\nthe  Party, are  forced by the manoeuvres  of  the\r\n\r\nleaders to take this stand today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>1.35 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, it is a bit late in the day to have a\r\n\r\nlively debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the rapidity with which events have moved\r\n\r\nduring  the  last  few weeks have been  as \r\n\r\nbreath-taking as they have been confusing. After two years\r\n\r\nof  tranquillity  and stability  under  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  we  are  once  more  plunged  into  an\r\n\r\natmosphere of political crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that this crisis should have\r\n\r\ncoincided  with the re-entry into this  Chamber  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Anson and his  re-emergence  into\r\n\r\npolitics after a permanent retirement is, I  think,\r\n\r\npurely coincidental, and I think it only fair  that\r\n\r\nhe  should  be  absolved from  any  blame  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, that the present crisis has been\r\n\r\nbrought about as a result of too many people trying\r\n\r\nto be too clever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Prime Minister earlier in the debate  outlined\r\n\r\nthe  forces and counter-forces responsible for  the\r\n\r\npresent crisis. It is a vast jig-saw puzzle. Though\r\n\r\nwe  have managed to fit many pieces together,  that\r\n\r\nis,  enough  to make sense out of the  strange  and\r\n\r\nextraordinary events of the last few  weeks,  there\r\n\r\nare  possibly still many pieces missing,  and  with\r\n\r\nluck  and assiduity we hope to be able to find  the\r\n\r\nother pieces - if not us, then maybe those befuddled\r\n\r\nand  over-clever plotters who are now  up  the  gum\r\n\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one thing is clear. Somebody is\r\n\r\nup  the  gum tree, and it clearly is not the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nIt may be the British. It may be, as the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson  anticipated, the beer-hall revolutionaries\r\n\r\nwho had hoped to manipulate the British but who  in\r\n\r\nfact  have been outwitted by the British. So,  Sir,\r\n\r\nin  the not too distant future we shall know who is\r\n\r\nup  the gum tree, when sooner or later - and I  think\r\n\r\nit  will  be sooner - anxious cries of distress  come\r\n\r\nfrom up the branches. The beer-hall revolutionaries\r\n\r\nmay   have  been  beguiled  by  the  British   into\r\n\r\nattacking and betraying their Party and comrades in\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. in the Anson by-election in the  belief\r\n\r\nthat  once  the  P.A.P. has been got  rid  off,  or\r\n\r\ncaptured, the revolutionary lambs can gambol  gaily\r\n\r\nwith the wily British lion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither I nor my colleagues know exactly what the\r\n\r\nBritish  lion will do once the revolutionary  sheep\r\n\r\nstart  running all over the place. It may  be  that\r\n\r\nthe  lion  will, like an indulgent shepherd,  allow\r\n\r\nitself  to  be bearded in its den for a while,  but\r\n\r\nlet  me  add that the old British lion's  beard  is\r\n\r\ntougher than beards recently sprouted. It  may  be\r\n\r\nthat  the  wily lion may want to find out how  many\r\n\r\nrevolutionary  lambs there are in the  fold  before\r\n\r\nits  thoughts  turn to more practical purposes - such\r\n\r\nas  making mutton chops for lunch out of gambolling\r\n\r\nlambs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For their information, may I give two recent news\r\n\r\nitems  which may or may not be of interest to them?\r\n\r\nThere  was  a radio programme over the B.B.C. last\r\n\r\nnight  discussing the situation in Singapore. After\r\n\r\noutlining the possible challenge to the P.A.P., and\r\n\r\nthe possible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nouster  of the P.A.P., the commentator gave  it  as\r\n\r\nhis opinion that the British would not intervene in\r\n\r\ncase  the P.A.P. withdrew from the political arena.\r\n\r\nThis  may  be a source of delight, I hope,  to  the\r\n\r\ngambolling revolutionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as against this, may I also draw attention to\r\n\r\nanother  report in the London Observer  which  says\r\n\r\nthat  the  constitution  might  be  suspended - which\r\n\r\nmeans, as far as I can see, mutton chops for lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, we are not interested how the\r\n\r\nsheep and the lion get on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are interested in is the future of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government and the aims  and  policies  for\r\n\r\nwhich   it   stands,   and  more   important,   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of an independent, democratic,\r\n\r\nnon-Communist socialist Malaya. Our primary concern  is\r\n\r\nwith  the  lives  and destinies  of  the  1,500,000\r\n\r\npeople who trusted us, and whatever happens we  are\r\n\r\nnot  going  to sell them out either to the  British\r\n\r\nplotters or the beer-hall revolutionaries who  have\r\n\r\nbeen duped by the British.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our intention to put to the people the whole\r\n\r\ntruth so that with, their support and trust we  can\r\n\r\nbring  to a successful conclusion the fight for  an\r\n\r\nindependent,  democratic,  non-Communist  socialist\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, though we lost an election in\r\n\r\nAnson we are happy because our hands are clean. Our\r\n\r\nhands are not stained by the blood of colleagues we\r\n\r\nhave betrayed. One of our Political Secretaries-and\r\n\r\nfor  the  information of the Member for  Cairnhill,\r\n\r\nwho  is  very interested in salaries, as far  as  I\r\n\r\nknow, that Political Secretary is still being  paid\r\n\r\na  salary - at  a forum in the University  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nsneered that a wounded P.A.P. Goliath limped out of\r\n\r\nHong Lim to meet the sling shots of David, who, for\r\n\r\nyour  information,  Sir, happens  to  be  also  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Sir, it is true that the P.A.P. Goliath\r\n\r\nlimped  out of Hong Lim. But it was not  the  sling\r\n\r\nshots  of  David that it met, but those of  another\r\n\r\nGoliath  that also limped out of Hong  Lim - the  Lim\r\n\r\nChing Siong Goliath. That is what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Political Secretary forgot to tell those people\r\n\r\nwho attended the forum at the University of Malaya.\r\n\r\nThere were two Goliaths, both equally wounded,  but\r\n\r\nwith this difference. Though the P.A.P. Goliath was\r\n\r\nbadly   mauled  in  Hong  Lim,  it  went  to  fight\r\n\r\nhonourably in Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what of the Lim Ching Siong Goliath, who was\r\n\r\nalso   mauled  and  wounded?  The  fact  that  this\r\n\r\nGoliath, which fought side by side with the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nwas able to be at large in Hong Lim, was due to one\r\n\r\nthing - that  we,  the  P.A.P.,  never  let  down  or\r\n\r\ndisavow our friends. If we make a promise, we  will\r\n\r\nkeep  it, whatever the merits or otherwise of  that\r\n\r\npromise.  We kept that promise, but the  Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong Goliath limped out of Hong Lim ostensibly  to\r\n\r\nfight side by side with the P.A.P. Goliath but,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  to  join David to betray a comrade in  Anson\r\n\r\nand  in  so doing reduced itself to the proportions\r\n\r\nof  a dwarf. It secured a victory for David - and we\r\n\r\nare  not blaming David for availing himself of  the\r\n\r\ngenerous assistance given to him. At least  it  may\r\n\r\nbe  said  of  him that he came out  openly  as  our\r\n\r\npolitical opponent. But not so the Lim Ching  Siong\r\n\r\nGoliath.  He and his friends were ready  to  betray\r\n\r\nthe  Party and the Government with which they  were\r\n\r\nopenly associated. Mr Lim, Mr Fong Swee Suan  and\r\n\r\nMr  Woodhull  remained  as  Political  Secretaries\r\n\r\nwhile openly indulging in activities calculated  to\r\n\r\nbring about the defeat of the P.A.P. candidate  who\r\n\r\nalso happened to be the President of the T.U.C. and\r\n\r\nthe S.T.C. These then are the great leaders, men of\r\n\r\nupright  character. Let me say, Sir, that a  friend\r\n\r\nof  mine told me that even among gangsters there is\r\n\r\nsome  honour.  When two gangsters get  together  to\r\n\r\nfight  another gangster, as long as they fight  the\r\n\r\nother  gangster, they observe a minimum  of  honour\r\n\r\nand  a certain code of ethics, one of which is that\r\n\r\nyou  do not stab your friend in the back until  you\r\n\r\nhave disposed of your common enemy. But never, even\r\n\r\namong  gangsters,  do you reduce  yourself  to  the\r\n\r\nlevel of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsticking  a  dagger into your own comrade  when  he\r\n\r\ncalls  out  for  help  and thereby  assisting  your\r\n\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any country, Sir, whether it is socialist,\r\n\r\nCommunist  or  capitalist, when a person  disagrees\r\n\r\nwith a government with which he is associated or by\r\n\r\nwhom he is employed to advise and assist, it is the\r\n\r\nordinary  decent practice for him  to  resign  from\r\n\r\noffice  before publicly opposing and  fighting  the\r\n\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But obviously these Political Secretaries, these\r\n\r\ngentlemen,  are out to establish new  standards  of\r\n\r\npolitical morality. Betrayal of the Government  and\r\n\r\nParty  colleagues  they  are  associated  with  are\r\n\r\npresumably  things to be proud  of.  What  is  even\r\n\r\nworse,  Sir,  is  that they deluded  eight  of  our\r\n\r\nAssemblymen into joining in the betrayal.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthese  Assemblymen came out with us for four weeks,\r\n\r\nI  think,  to  canvass for the P.A.P. candidate  in\r\n\r\nAnson. They came with us telling the voters to vote\r\n\r\nfor  our candidate, the P.A.P. candidate. And  yet,\r\n\r\nthe  day before Polling Day, they came out  with  a\r\n\r\nletter  under  the  pretence  that  they  had  been\r\n\r\nprovoked  into  publishing it.  If  they  had  been\r\n\r\nprovoked,  they  could have  still  waited  for  24\r\n\r\nhours.  It  was quite clear that what was happening\r\n\r\nwas  that the present Member for Anson looked  like\r\n\r\nlosing,  and it therefore became necessary for  the\r\n\r\nsix trade unionists and for the dupes in the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nranks  to be mobilised to throw in their weight  in\r\n\r\nopen  intervention  in favour of  our  opponent  in\r\n\r\nAnson.  We  know very well that at the last  minute\r\n\r\ncertain unionists were openly canvassing for  votes\r\n\r\nfor our opponent in Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of these Assemblymen may be thinking\r\n\r\nthat    it   is   all   great   fun   playing    at\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries. But they should know what they are\r\n\r\nin  for. If they are not Communists, they are going\r\n\r\nto  be dupes. I suggest to them that they read what\r\n\r\nis   in   store  for  those  who  allow  themselves\r\n\r\nunknowingly to be used as dupes. There  is  a  book\r\n\r\ncalled Revolutionary Catechism which was written by\r\n\r\na   young   Russian  revolutionary  called   Sergei\r\n\r\nNechayev.  His  work was greatly admired  by  Lenin\r\n\r\nwho, though repudiating many of the tenets of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncatechism,  at least made some of it the  basis  of\r\n\r\nhis  strategy  and tactics on how to  carry  out  a\r\n\r\nrevolution. With your permission, Sir, I will  just\r\n\r\nread a few extracts. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A good revolutionary is tyrannical towards\r\n\r\nhimself.   The  revolutionary  must  be  tyrannical\r\n\r\ntowards  others. All the emotions that  move  human\r\n\r\nbeings  (things like loyalty, friendship), all  the\r\n\r\nsoft  and  enervating  feelings  and  kinship - love,\r\n\r\nfriendship, gratitude and honour - must give way  to\r\n\r\na cold and single-minded passion for revolution.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he goes on to describe what to do with\r\n\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When a comrade is in danger [and it is just as\r\n\r\nwell for some of our colleagues who have been duped\r\n\r\nby  other men into betraying our comrades for  them\r\n\r\nto  remember this injunction by Nechayev] it may be\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  determine whether he is  expendable.\r\n\r\nThe decision must not be arrived at on the basis of\r\n\r\nsentiment;  only  the  eventual  success   of   the\r\n\r\nrevolution has any importance at this juncture.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>1.55 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (MR G. KANDASAMY) in the Chair.]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he described the various groups of men that\r\n\r\nhe  could use as dupes. He named six, but two would\r\n\r\nbe of some interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The third group consists of people in high\r\n\r\npositions,    remarkable    neither    for    their\r\n\r\nintelligence nor their energy, but who have wealth,\r\n\r\nconnections,  influence and power as  a  result  of\r\n\r\ntheir position. We must blackmail them, ferret  out\r\n\r\ntheir  dirty secrets and make them slaves. In  this\r\n\r\nway,  their power, their position, their  influence\r\n\r\nand  their wealth become an inexhaustible  treasure\r\n\r\nand a precious asset in our adventure.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the fifth group who can also be used\r\n\r\nas dupes, and they are also equally expendable. May\r\n\r\nI    suggest    that   some   of   the    beer-hall\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries pay heed to this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The fifth group comprises doctrinaires,\r\n\r\nconspirators, revolutionaries, those who orate away\r\n\r\nat  meetings  or on paper. They must be  constantly\r\n\r\ndriven into ambiguous positions, (that is, get them\r\n\r\nto  betray  their  friends. That  is  an  ambiguous\r\n\r\nposition.) They must be compelled to come out  into\r\n\r\nthe  open and assume real and dangerous tasks (that\r\n\r\nmight be the next step, the next commitment.)  When\r\n\r\nthe  revolution is over, the majority of these will\r\n\r\ndisappear,  but of the rest we shall  make  genuine\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo  to  those  who want to play at revolution  with\r\n\r\ndedicated revolutionaries. I suggest they read  the\r\n\r\n\"Revolutionary Catechism\" of Nechayev  because,  at\r\n\r\nleast,  they would know what is in store  for  them\r\n\r\nwhen  the  real revolutionaries have  decided  that\r\n\r\nthese people have outlived their usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, getting the tenderfoot revolutionaries to\r\n\r\nbetray  their  friends is part of the technique  of\r\n\r\ncommitment.   At   least,   under   the   Communist\r\n\r\ntechnique, if somebody wants to join the  movement,\r\n\r\nthey  get  them to do something which would  commit\r\n\r\nthem  and thereafter there is no retreat. In  fact,\r\n\r\npart  of the act of commitment is to get people  to\r\n\r\ndo  things  which  outrage their sense  of  honour,\r\n\r\ndecency and which go against their conscience;  and\r\n\r\nonce  the  unfortunate waverers have been  confused\r\n\r\nand   persuaded  into  betrayal  of   friends   and\r\n\r\ncolleagues, then all self-respect is lost  and  all\r\n\r\nlines of retreat are cut off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what was all this betrayal in aid of? It now\r\n\r\nturns out that all this betrayal was unwittingly to\r\n\r\naid  the super designs of the British. Let me state\r\n\r\nhere,  Sir,  that I do not for one  moment  believe\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Lim  Ching Siong and  his  friends  were\r\n\r\nconsciously aiding and abetting the designs of  the\r\n\r\nBritish. Our opinion of Mr Lim Ching Siong and his\r\n\r\nfriends  is  that  they  are not  pro-colonialists,\r\n\r\nRight-wingers or even opportunists. I have no doubt\r\n\r\nthey  believe sincerely in the things in which they\r\n\r\nbelieve. We say that we in the P.A.P. stand for  an\r\n\r\nindependent,  democratic, non-Communist,  socialist\r\n\r\nMalaya. But what has happened is that Mr Lim Ching\r\n\r\nSiong  and his friends had hoped to manipulate  the\r\n\r\nBritish.  But as things have turned out, they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  manipulated by the British in the  hope  that\r\n\r\nthey  would come into open conflict with the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand,  if  necessary, destroy the P.A.P. We  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. might have fallen into this trap had we  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  free ourselves of  the  ideological\r\n\r\nblinkers  which  obviously have  been  the  driving\r\n\r\npurpose  behind  the thinking of Mr  Lim  and  his\r\n\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our defeat in Hong Lim, when the bridge\r\n\r\nbetween us and Mr Lim Ching Siong grew wider,  our\r\n\r\nfirst belief was that all the manoeuvrings were  an\r\n\r\nattempt  by  pro-Communist elements to  coerce  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership  into  providing  a  favourable\r\n\r\nclimate for the growth of Communist forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we too have read the Communist theory and\r\n\r\npractice  on  united fronts. We  have  read  how  a\r\n\r\nunited front should be tolerated by Communists only\r\n\r\ninsofar   as   the  non-Communist  leadership   was\r\n\r\nmanipulable.  For two years, the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nhas  steadfastly refused to be manipulated  and  we\r\n\r\nknew  that the pro-Communist elements were  getting\r\n\r\nfed  up with us. Our initial analysis was that many\r\n\r\nof  their manoeuvres after our defeat in Hong  Lim,\r\n\r\nthough rather irritating, were but usual manoeuvres\r\n\r\nto force the P.A.P. to steer off course. After all,\r\n\r\nthese  manoeuvres have been going on in  the  Party\r\n\r\nfor many years and for us it has become a matter of\r\n\r\nroutine to deal with these little pressures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When on 2nd June, the six trade Unionists came out\r\n\r\nwith a statement supporting the P.A.P. in Anson but\r\n\r\nasking the P.A.P. to fight for full internal  \r\n\r\nself-government,  we  were a little angry  but  regarded\r\n\r\nthis as no more than an aggressive manoeuvre to get\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to depart from its line of independence\r\n\r\nthrough  merger. When the six trade  unionists  and\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretaries issued this statement  asking\r\n\r\nus  to fight for full internal self-government when\r\n\r\nconstitutional  talks  are  started,  we  were  not\r\n\r\nconsulted,  though what they asked was  a  complete\r\n\r\nreversal of what they and the P.A.P. had stood  for\r\n\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, we dismissed this as another manoeuvre to\r\n\r\nmake  the P.A.P. leadership uncomfortable. However,\r\n\r\nwe  were  reassured by the fact that the six  trade\r\n\r\nunionists  and  their 43 unions had  endorsed  full\r\n\r\nsupport  for  the P.A.P. in Anson and extolled  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. as the leading anti-colonial force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Party Chairman on 9th June came out\r\n\r\nwith a statement that the P.A.P. was going to fight\r\n\r\nfor  nothing less than independence through  merger\r\n\r\nin   1963.  It  was  no  more  than  a  strong  and\r\n\r\ncategorical  reaffirmation of what has always  been\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.'s stand. Also the thawing of opinion  in\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  about  taking  in  Singapore  had\r\n\r\nconvinced   us   that  merger  was  now   practical\r\n\r\npolitics.   We   expected  that  this   categorical\r\n\r\nstatement  of intentions would be well received  by\r\n\r\nthe  six trade unionists who had for some time been\r\n\r\ncalling into question our anti-colonial sentiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of a favourable reception, the six trade\r\n\r\nunionists and their friends came out with a vicious\r\n\r\nand  open attack against the P.A.P. leadership  and\r\n\r\nits reaffirmation of the policy of merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not then realise why they were so bitter\r\n\r\ntowards merger. We could not then understand  their\r\n\r\nrepeated  demand  that we publish  the  details  of\r\n\r\nmerger,  even though we for our own part  reassured\r\n\r\nthem  that we had no details about merger  or  even\r\n\r\nsuper-merger. All that had happened  was  that  the\r\n\r\npolitical  units concerned - that is, the Federation,\r\n\r\nSingapore,  Borneo,  and so  on - had  more  or  less\r\n\r\nindicated  that  they  were  ready  to  endorse  in\r\n\r\nprinciple  the idea of a super-merger.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  said  that it endorsed super-merger  in\r\n\r\nprinciple  if  that would speed up  merger  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation. We could not disclose\r\n\r\ndetails,  because  there  were  no  details.   What\r\n\r\npuzzled  us was this reversal on merger by Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing Siong and his friends. One would have thought\r\n\r\nthat  the Communists themselves would have welcomed\r\n\r\na  merger, if only to establish Communism on a\r\n\r\npan-Malayan basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more inexplicable was the publication by the\r\n\r\nsix  unionists, not long after Dr Toh's  statement\r\n\r\non   merger,   of  four  demands - the   release   of\r\n\r\ndetainees,  the granting of citizenship to  certain\r\n\r\nindividuals  closely connected with Mr  Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong,  the unification of trade unions and greater\r\n\r\nfreedom of speech, assembly, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our understanding of the situation was that\r\n\r\nwere the P.A.P. to act on these demands - that is, on\r\n\r\nthe demand, say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  release of detainees - then a constitutional\r\n\r\ncrisis  could  be created leading  to  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  the Government might be confronted with  the\r\n\r\nprospect   of  resignation,  depending   upon   the\r\n\r\nreaction of both the Federation and the British. At\r\n\r\nleast that was our expectation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet the six trade unionists repeatedly asked\r\n\r\nus  and in fact mobilised support to ensure that we\r\n\r\ndid  not resign. Now this was the puzzle. Why  then\r\n\r\nwere  the  six trade unionists suddenly, after  the\r\n\r\nannouncement  of  merger, asking us  to  do  things\r\n\r\nwhich,  in the normal course of events, could  lead\r\n\r\nto  the resignation of the Government? That was the\r\n\r\npuzzle. And again we thought, well, this is another\r\n\r\nobscure  manoeuvre on the part of the pro-Communist\r\n\r\nelements  to  embarrass the P.A.P. leadership.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  in  an  editorial in  Petir,  we  asked  the\r\n\r\nunionists   bluntly   whether   they   wanted   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to resign as a result of acting on their\r\n\r\nfour  immediate demands. Strangely enough,  all  we\r\n\r\ngot  was  an  evasive reply saying that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  had always been talking of  resignation\r\n\r\nand that if it resigned the unionists could not  be\r\n\r\nheld responsible. Somehow they evaded the question.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because up to 9th June, the whole resources of\r\n\r\ntheir propaganda and manipulations were to see that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. stayed in power. But when on 9th  June,\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman of the Party announced that there was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  a  merger, the same  unionists  were\r\n\r\nforcing us to do things which sooner or later  must\r\n\r\nlead   to  a  constitutional  crisis,  or  to   our\r\n\r\nresignation.  All  this was  puzzling.  Somehow  we\r\n\r\ncould  not  explain  it. It was completely  out  of\r\n\r\ncharacter.  This was not what they had  been  doing\r\n\r\nfor  many years. Then just before Polling Day,  Mr\r\n\r\nLim  and his friends opened fire against the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand  openly supported Mr Marshall in the Anson\r\n\r\nby-election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It became clear to us then that what the six\r\n\r\nunionists and their friends were out to do  was  to\r\n\r\nbring about the defeat of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their last-minute intervention in Anson, through\r\n\r\neight  P.A.P. Assemblymen, was the act that  helped\r\n\r\nthe  pieces  of the puzzle to fall into  a  pattern\r\n\r\nwhich  suddenly  explained to us what  it  was  all\r\n\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It dawned on us that our analysis was all wrong,\r\n\r\nthat  the  actions of Mr Lim Ching Siong  and  his\r\n\r\nfriends could not be explained away as the kind  of\r\n\r\nmanoeuvres  they  had indulged in all  these  years\r\n\r\ninside the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On the face of it, it suggested a\r\n\r\nrecklessness on the part of Mr Lim and his friends\r\n\r\nwhich  could, so we thought, lead them to disaster.\r\n\r\nAnd  if the P.A.P. resigned or the Constitution was\r\n\r\nsuspended, then the Communist elements would be the\r\n\r\nfirst to suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the defects of Mr Lim Ching Siong and\r\n\r\nhis  friends, they are not reckless men.  They  are\r\n\r\nnot men who make calculations on pure intuition and\r\n\r\nguesswork. So we had to look for the key  piece  in\r\n\r\nthe   puzzle.  It  had  to  be  an  analysis  which\r\n\r\nexplained all the facts, which gave rationality  to\r\n\r\nwhat  appeared to be the reckless behaviour of Mr,\r\n\r\nLint Ching Siong and his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key piece, it turned out, was the British.\r\n\r\nSir,  there  is  a short story by G. K.  Chesterton\r\n\r\nwhere  the  detective almost failed  to  solve  the\r\n\r\nmurder mystery simply because he had overlooked one\r\n\r\nsuspect - the postman. The postman is taken  so  much\r\n\r\nfor  granted  that no suspicion is aroused  by  the\r\n\r\nfact that he visited the murdered man's place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with the British. We were so preoccupied\r\n\r\nwith thinking that this was a manoeuvre between the\r\n\r\nnon-Communist  P.A.P. and the  Communist  elements\r\n\r\nthat   we   forgot   that   the   British   too-the\r\n\r\npostman-were somewhere around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.14 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Sir, the Prime Minister has sketched out\r\n\r\nfor  you  the role the British have played  in  all\r\n\r\nthis.  Now all the pieces fall into place. Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nand  his friends were not being reckless in working\r\n\r\nfor  the downfall of the P.A.P. leadership,  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  they had managed to persuade  the  British\r\n\r\nthat  they  could - and we know for a fact - with  the\r\n\r\nassistance of certain \"young turks\" take  over  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the Party. Mr Lim and his  friends\r\n\r\nhad,  I  presume, some assurance that if they  took\r\n\r\nover or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\nif  they created a new united front, nothing  would\r\n\r\nhappen. In fact, Sir, I may tell you this. When  it\r\n\r\nlooked  as if the split between the P.A.P. and  the\r\n\r\nso-called  trade unionists was becoming more  acute\r\n\r\nand growing wider, the editor of one of the English\r\n\r\nSunday papers came to see me as mediator. He asked,\r\n\r\n\"Why  should the Left drift apart? Can't  something\r\n\r\nbe  done?\"  I  said,  \"Well, it is  very  difficult\r\n\r\nbecause   since  then  they  have  made  four   new\r\n\r\ndemands - internal self-government,  the  release  of\r\n\r\ndetainees,  and  so  on - which  are  all  completely\r\n\r\ncontrary to our policy.\" For example, over the case\r\n\r\nof  the  release of the detainees, obviously  there\r\n\r\nmust be some crisis. This editor told me, with half\r\n\r\na  smile,  obviously knowingly, \"Raja, I think  you\r\n\r\ndon't  know  much  because  these  boys  [i.e. the\r\n\r\nunionists]  have  a  good pipeline  with  the  U.K.\r\n\r\nCommission.\" At that time it meant nothing. I  took\r\n\r\nit  as  just  one of those things.  But  after  our\r\n\r\ndefeat  in Anson, when Mr Lim Ching Siong and  his\r\n\r\nfriends,  for no rhyme or reason, went all  out  to\r\n\r\nsecure  defeat for the P.A.P. with which they  were\r\n\r\nopenly  associated  and  were  prepared  to   brand\r\n\r\nthemselves     publicly    as     betrayers     and\r\n\r\ntraitors - nobody can overlook that fact - then we felt\r\n\r\nthat  the  reason why they were moved to  commit  a\r\n\r\ngross  act  of betrayal was that somehow  or  other\r\n\r\nthey had been deluded by the British into believing\r\n\r\nthat  betraying  the P.A.P. did  not  matter;  they\r\n\r\nmight  suffer  humiliation or lose the  respect  of\r\n\r\nmany  members of the Party, but a bigger stake  was\r\n\r\ninvolved.  Therefore, Mr Lim and his friends  were\r\n\r\ndeluded   by  the  British  into  opposing   merger\r\n\r\nbecause, somehow, they had been led to believe that\r\n\r\nmerger  was something which had been signed, sealed\r\n\r\nand  delivered, which was a sell-out of  them,  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. was somehow in cahoots  with  the\r\n\r\nTengku to sell out Mr Lim and his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that if the P.A.P. could not release the\r\n\r\ndetainees,  then  the  British  were  prepared   to\r\n\r\nrelease   them   and   they  could   find   another\r\n\r\nalternative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntype  of  government or Party which would  be  more\r\n\r\nliberal  about these things. They felt  that  after\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. had lost Anson, that defeat could  then\r\n\r\nprovide  the  necessary fuel to  oust  the  present\r\n\r\nleadership of the P.A.P. Government and the  Party.\r\n\r\nThe immediate plan was for the removal of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  and  the whole fury of  the  attack  was\r\n\r\nconcentrated  on  one individual.  Somehow  it  was\r\n\r\nbelieved  that if one individual was  removed,  the\r\n\r\nwhole  organisation,  the whole  party,  the  whole\r\n\r\nmachinery  could be reformed. There was  a  purpose\r\n\r\nbehind  it.  First, for Prime Minister, they  could\r\n\r\nput in somebody else. Many names were mentioned - Dr\r\n\r\nGoh,  Dr  Toh. After three months they would  say,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  there was not enough intra-party democracy.\r\n\r\nOut  with  Dr  Toh.\" Then Dr Goh. \"Out  with  Dr\r\n\r\nGoh.\"  One  by  one.  Then somehow  other  patterns\r\n\r\nfitted  in. Why were they pressing for the granting\r\n\r\nof citizenship to certain people? If the design was\r\n\r\nthis,  then  probably the Prime Minister  could  be\r\n\r\npushed out and challenged to an election in Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.  Then  somebody who had not got  citizenship\r\n\r\nbut  who had great aspirations and who had probably\r\n\r\nmanaged to sell himself to Lord Selkirk as  just  a\r\n\r\nliberal Communist or a Liberal-Socialist would then\r\n\r\ncontest if he could get citizenship. Then when  the\r\n\r\nnext  leader of the Party, Dr Toh, was pushed out,\r\n\r\na  big offensive would be mounted - \"No, there is not\r\n\r\nenough  democracy in the Party. You (Dr Toh)  must\r\n\r\ngo.\" Then somebody else if he got citizenship would\r\n\r\nstand  for election. In that way the hope was  that\r\n\r\nperhaps  in  the  course of time the  Front-benches\r\n\r\ncould  be  filled  with new  leaders  who,  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  cannot  get  into  the  Assembly,   either\r\n\r\nbecause they have not got citizenship or because of\r\n\r\nsome  other reason. Anyway, it is quite clear,  and\r\n\r\nwe  know  for a fact, that there have been  in  our\r\n\r\nParty  for the last two or three months young turks\r\n\r\nplotting, manipulating, arguing who is to be  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, who is to be the Minister for Finance and\r\n\r\nso  on. Some of these men, I think, have been duped\r\n\r\ninto  believing  that  they were  doing  the  right\r\n\r\nthing. But there are five\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersons  who are far more serious about  revolution\r\n\r\nthan  any of us are. Therefore, Sir, we have  today\r\n\r\nreached  a  situation where a lot  of  things  have\r\n\r\nbecome  clearer.  A  lot  of  the  antics  of   and\r\n\r\nbetrayals by Mr Lim and his associates are not  so\r\n\r\nlunatic and reckless as they look because they have\r\n\r\nbeen  led  to believe that nothing untowards  would\r\n\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the drama is not yet finished. This exposure\r\n\r\nnow  presents  the  British  and  Mr  Lim  with  a\r\n\r\ndilemma - who  will betray whom? Who is  up  the  gum\r\n\r\ntree and how will be  come down without running into\r\n\r\ndisaster?  Anyway, Sir, we of the P.A.P. will  make\r\n\r\nour  own  arrangements and manipulate and manoeuvre\r\n\r\nas  we  think fit. But Mr Lim and his friends  can\r\n\r\nthank  us for one thing - that if we had been  wrong,\r\n\r\nif  we  had not seen - what this manoeuvre  was  all\r\n\r\nabout, then we might have been forced into a  clash\r\n\r\nwith  Mr Lim and his friends. Fortunately  we  did\r\n\r\nnot  fall  into the trap and we hope we will  never\r\n\r\nfall  into  the  trap or be made dupes  of  by  the\r\n\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.24 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe    have   been   here   since   2.30   yesterday\r\n\r\nafternoon - only 12 hours, Mr Speaker, but  by  your\r\n\r\ngrace we have been allowed outside this Chamber for\r\n\r\none  hour  in order that we might be more fortified\r\n\r\nto  come and listen to the troubles and woes of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., the Party in power. We have been told about\r\n\r\ndupes and people who are duped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite innocent in politics.\r\n\r\nWhen  people say something, I believe them. I  take\r\n\r\neverything that is said at its face value. I do not\r\n\r\nanalyse  it  in  the way the Minister  for  Culture\r\n\r\nanalyses it and reads into it things that  are  not\r\n\r\nread into by normal persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I received the motion, \"That this House\r\n\r\nexpresses its confidence in the Government\", I  was\r\n\r\na little uncertain as to what exactly it meant. The\r\n\r\nmotion,  as  it stood, inevitably meant  that  this\r\n\r\nAssembly was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing  called because the public interest  demanded\r\n\r\nit  and  that,  therefore, a situation  existed  in\r\n\r\nSingapore which merited the calling of the Assembly\r\n\r\nwhich   had  been  adjourned  sine  die   by   \r\n\r\nthe Government. Now, the motion as it stands must  mean\r\n\r\nthat  the Government is asking the House as a whole\r\n\r\nto  express its confidence in all the work  it  has\r\n\r\ndone  to date, and all the work its hopes to do  so\r\n\r\nlong  as  it  continues to hold the  reins  of  the\r\n\r\ngovernment.  Therefore,  Mr  Speaker,  it   became\r\n\r\npertinent  to  find  out what exactly  this  motion\r\n\r\nmeant. The work of the last, two years. Now I  look\r\n\r\nat  the  Minister for National Development, who  is\r\n\r\nwell,  and truly asleep at the moment, to  find out\r\n\r\nexactly  what  his Ministry has  done.  So  far  as\r\n\r\nhousing  is  concerned,  very  little.  So  far  as\r\n\r\npromises  are concerned, a great deal. I then  turn\r\n\r\nto  his  neighbour, the Minister for  Education.  I\r\n\r\nwill  not say that his Ministry is a complete  flop\r\n\r\nin the way the Ministry of National Development has\r\n\r\nbeen a complete flop, but at least the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  has  created  a situation  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhereby  parents  are,  dissatisfied,  pupils   are\r\n\r\ndissatisfied, teachers are dissatisfied.  So,  Mr,\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  one  cannot  say that  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation has made a great success of his Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we come to the redoubtable Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Law  who has just come  back  after  a\r\n\r\nconference on labour problems in Geneva and London.\r\n\r\nI  hope the atmosphere there was more congenial  to\r\n\r\nhim  than  it would have been had he been here.  So\r\n\r\nfar  as the Ministry of Labour is concerned,  if  I\r\n\r\nmay  deal  with  that  side of the  Honourable  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  Ministry, it has  somehow  not  been  a\r\n\r\nhowling success. Neither do the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nthink  he  has  made  a  howling  success  of  that\r\n\r\nMinistry.  The  way in which labour  problems  have\r\n\r\nbeen  handled, from my point of view, is completely\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory. A Minister for Labour,  seeking  to\r\n\r\nbring about a settlement of a trade dispute, to  my\r\n\r\nmind,  Mr  Speaker, must try and hold the  balance\r\n\r\nequally between the employee and the employer. That\r\n\r\nis my understanding of how the Minister should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbehave. I know it is very difficult sometimes, but\r\n\r\nhe must do his best to give that impression. Unless\r\n\r\nhe  is  able to give that impression to both sides,\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  trying  to be  fair  to  both  sides,\r\n\r\ninevitably  he  fails in his duty as  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour. Being Minister for Labour does not mean, to\r\n\r\nmy  mind, that he must advocate labour blindly  and\r\n\r\ndisregard whatever rights or equities the  employer\r\n\r\nmight  have in such a situation. The result now  is\r\n\r\nthat  in  so  far as the employer is concerned,  he\r\n\r\ntrembles  when  he goes to the Hon. the  Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice - not a very happy situation for Singapore. It\r\n\r\ncould well be that that situation enables labour to\r\n\r\nget  everything it wants - a good thing perhaps. But\r\n\r\nas  the  Government, it is the duty of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  to  hold the balance  equally  between\r\n\r\nthese two contesting claimants. I know he says  his\r\n\r\nis   a   labour  Government.  His  is   a   workers\r\n\r\nGovernment, but he must also understand that in the\r\n\r\nsystem  of society in which he is working,  capital\r\n\r\nand  labour  must play a part, and unless  both  of\r\n\r\nthem  work  amicably, the economy of  this  country\r\n\r\nmust  suffer. And to that extent, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  has  failed. So the Labour Ministry  cannot\r\n\r\nget  the vote of confidence which this motion seeks\r\n\r\nto obtain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about his Ministry of Law? Frankly he has\r\n\r\nbeen so engaged on the labour front that he has not\r\n\r\nhad much time to devote to the law front. If he had\r\n\r\ndevoted  as much time to the law front  as  he  had\r\n\r\ndevoted to the labour front, I do not know what the\r\n\r\nsituation  with regard to the law front would  have\r\n\r\nbeen. However, that is as it is, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the Hon. the Prime Minister. The\r\n\r\nHon. the Prime Minister, Mr Speaker, is the  most\r\n\r\ndexterous  politician that has walked the political\r\n\r\nhalls  of  Singapore. How long he will continue  to\r\n\r\nstraddle  both worlds which he hopes to keep  under\r\n\r\nhis control only time will tell. May I tell this to\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Prime Minister? We on the Opposition\r\n\r\nare   really  not  interested  in  these   domestic\r\n\r\nsquabbles  or on questions whether tie  is  fit  to\r\n\r\nlead  them or whether he has their confidence.  But\r\n\r\nwe, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  are  interested  in  the  Prime  Minister  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. The Prime Minister of Singapore does not\r\n\r\nbelong to the P.A.P. He belongs to the country, and\r\n\r\nunless  the  Prime  Minister understands  that,  we\r\n\r\nshall   always  have  trouble  in  Singapore.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Prime Minister's failing has been\r\n\r\nthat he has been a party mars first, jockeying  for\r\n\r\npower in the Party first and letting the country go\r\n\r\nto the dogs. That is what history will write of him\r\n\r\nwhen history is written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Deputy Prime Minister - the most peaceable\r\n\r\nman in the P.A.P. arena, the man who can keep peace\r\n\r\nbetwixt  the two warring parties. Therefore,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  want to say very much about him. He deals with\r\n\r\nMinistries  which are not political. He deals  with\r\n\r\nthe  weather.  The trouble is that  we  cannot  get\r\n\r\nenough rain at the moment. Our reservoirs are dried\r\n\r\nup, but that is not his fault. That is the fault of\r\n\r\nthe  heavens  and the gods. They  are  not  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. That is not a matter which we can lay at the\r\n\r\ndoors of the Deputy Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Minister for Health. Doctors have\r\n\r\nresigned. There is a shortage of doctors, and there\r\n\r\nare   very   few  specialists  in  the   hospitals.\r\n\r\nDiscontent  in the medical service. Recruitment  of\r\n\r\nJapanese      doctors      from      abroad - further\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  in the service.  Allegations  that\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese  doctors do not know  what  they  are\r\n\r\ndoing  or  what  they are prescribing.  A  loss  of\r\n\r\nconfidence   in  the  hospitals,  and,   therefore,\r\n\r\ninevitably,  people go to private practitioners - not\r\n\r\na  very good state of affairs in a society where we\r\n\r\nhave  a socialist government which is governing  us\r\n\r\nand  which should, therefore, provide adequate  and\r\n\r\nsuitable  hospital  facilities for  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. The hospital facilities today are at the\r\n\r\nworst  possible level they have been  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  a  long, long time. So what confidence can  we\r\n\r\nhave  in the Minister for Health? Although  I  like\r\n\r\nhim  very much personally - he is a gentleman and  it\r\n\r\nis very difficult to find a gentleman in the P.A.P. \r\n\r\n- unfortunately he is one of them, and anything that\r\n\r\nis  connected with the P.A.P. seems not to be  able\r\n\r\nto  get  on  in  its human relationships  with  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Now  might  I  tell  the  Hon. the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever   brilliant  his  Cabinet  might  be,   the\r\n\r\ndecisions  of  this  brilliant  Cabinet   must   be\r\n\r\nimplemented  by human beings who are  paid  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, who work under the Government and below\r\n\r\nthose  servants. If the Government  cannot  command\r\n\r\nthe  respect  and  the  loyalty  of  those  people,\r\n\r\nhowever  brilliant your policies may be, Mr  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  they  must inevitably  fail.  They  have\r\n\r\nfailed because-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have not as yet aspired to\r\n\r\nthe  position  of Prime Minister.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  must  remember he is  addressing  the\r\n\r\nChair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nMight I remind the Prime Minister then through you,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, that if he wishes to govern this\r\n\r\nplace   well,  there  must  be  humanity   in   his\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  not  this inhumanity  and  driving\r\n\r\npeople  as  if  they  were  slaves  or  morons   or\r\n\r\nmachines?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Minister for Finance. The Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance,  able  economist though he  may  be,  must\r\n\r\ntranslate  his theoretical knowledge, his undoubted\r\n\r\ntheoretical  ability, bring it to  the  ground  and\r\n\r\nmake  it work in the form of rice and work for  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. Then, and only then, will  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore accept him as an able  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister.  His  colleagues, I know, think  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of  him,  and so do I, Mr Speaker,  for  his\r\n\r\nundoubted ability to analyse a situation  well  and\r\n\r\ntry  to  present  something on the results  of  his\r\n\r\nanalysis. Certainly he has great ability. But  what\r\n\r\nuse  has  that  undoubted ability of  his  been  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  during the last two years of his  tenure\r\n\r\nof  office? As the Minister himself has  said,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  the  most  pressing  problem   for\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  the  question of the  common  market\r\n\r\nwhich  is  to be established between the Federation\r\n\r\nand ourselves. Naturally that is the only solution,\r\n\r\nand  we  have been waiting anxiously for the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister to make some sort of statement\r\n\r\non  this  common  market.  No  statement  has  been\r\n\r\nforthcoming.  No statement will be forthcoming,  it\r\n\r\nwould appear, for a long time. We have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npatient  enough,  Mr Speaker,  Sir, I  think  the\r\n\r\npeople deserve a reply to this soon. Are you  going\r\n\r\nto succeed, may I ask the Hon. the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nthrough you, Mr Speaker, Sir? What has happened to\r\n\r\nthis  common market? It has been mentioned in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  a long time ago. If we are to have a  common\r\n\r\nmarket, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are not going to  wait\r\n\r\nfor  it for another two or three years. We want  it\r\n\r\nnow.  The  people want it now. Then  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister puts out his Four-year Development\r\n\r\nProgramme.  He  tells the people of Singapore  that\r\n\r\nthis  is the solution to their economic ills.  What\r\n\r\nare  the solutions in the Four-year Plan? What  are\r\n\r\nhis industrial development plans? His steel mill in\r\n\r\nJurong?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Coming up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Coming up!

It will\r\n\r\ntake  him four years to fill it up, and he will  be\r\n\r\nout of office by then. And nothing has happened  in\r\n\r\nJurong  yet. Steel mill? Now let us really  analyse\r\n\r\nthe  position  of the steel mill. He  has  not  got\r\n\r\nenough  water to work that steel mill, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir. He has not got enough water to give the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore to drink, let alone run a steel mill.\r\n\r\nDo  not  forget it. He needs 10 million gallons  of\r\n\r\nwater a day to run this steel mill. That is what he\r\n\r\nhas  not  told  the  people of Singapore;  and  the\r\n\r\nreservoirs  at MacRitchie, Pierce and  Seletar  are\r\n\r\ndried  up for the first time in 50 years,  and  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has  the effrontery  to  tell  the\r\n\r\ncountry that Singapore has not had it so good as it\r\n\r\nhas under his Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You have just said that the\r\n\r\ngods are responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes. Now that the Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nbrought me back to it, I remember the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  in  one  of his speeches during  the  1959\r\n\r\nelections  said,  \"We  do  not  leave  anything  to\r\n\r\nchance.  We do not leave anything to the  gods.  We\r\n\r\nplan them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nourselves and we see that we deliver the  goods  on\r\n\r\nour plans.\" And the Prime Minister was bleating the\r\n\r\nother  day when he was faced with a water shortage,\r\n\r\n\"What  can  I do? I have not had rain. The  sky  is\r\n\r\nagainst  me. The gods are against me.\" Now is  this\r\n\r\nthe  sort  of  cry a socialist Prime Minister  lets\r\n\r\nout, Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask you, when he faces the\r\n\r\ncountry with a water shortage? More of that  later,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I will come back to that  later.\r\n\r\nSo much for the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Hon. the Minister for Home Affairs, who\r\n\r\nis  happily  married.  He is  one  of  the  quieter\r\n\r\nMinisters   of  the  P.A.P.  Government,   a   very\r\n\r\ndifficult gentleman to fathom, as all Ministers for\r\n\r\nthe  Interior  should be. I believe he  knows  more\r\n\r\nabout  the Communist movement underground than  any\r\n\r\nother  Minister  should, because it  is  under  his\r\n\r\nportfolio,  as  the police are,  and  therefore  he\r\n\r\nshould  know exactly what goes on on a lower level.\r\n\r\nYet  we  get  to the situation, Mr Speaker,  where\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  in  danger, where the  non-Communist\r\n\r\nLeft,  with  the  Hon. the Prime  Minister  as  the\r\n\r\nleader,  and the Communist Left, of which  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing Siong is the leader, are about to clash,  and\r\n\r\nthereby  threatening the whole  of  the  democratic\r\n\r\nfabric  with  ruin, and yet the  Minister  for  the\r\n\r\nInterior,  the  Minister for Home  Affairs,  thinks\r\n\r\nthat  everything is all right. He is  quite  happy.\r\n\r\nNothing  has been done about the situation.  He  is\r\n\r\neven  now  quite  content not to do anything  about\r\n\r\nthis  Communist  Left which he says is  threatening\r\n\r\nthe  very  existence of the Government, a situation\r\n\r\nwhich I find very difficult to understand. If it is\r\n\r\ntrue,  then  what confidence can  we  have  in  his\r\n\r\nMinistry? Now for the Minister for Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nothing very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Nothing very much! I must say, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  that  I  enjoy  listening  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture's speeches.  They  are  very\r\n\r\nilluminating. They are the speeches of a well-read,\r\n\r\ncultured  gentleman. Although my  leader  does  not\r\n\r\nthink  the  Minister is cultured, I have  different\r\n\r\nviews about him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You have not been to the same\r\n\r\nplaces!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> We have not been to the same places,\r\n\r\nno.  But  we might have. So far as the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture is concerned, Mr Speaker, Sir, its  effort\r\n\r\nto   create  a  Malayan  culture  has  been   quite\r\n\r\npathetic. No one, however sympathetic he may be  to\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Culture,  will  say  that  his\r\n\r\nMinistry has been a howling success. So, therefore,\r\n\r\non that basis this motion meant nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really and sincerely thought, Mr Speaker, that\r\n\r\nto  summon  this Assembly, which had been adjourned\r\n\r\nsine  die,  at  a  moment's notice meant  that  the\r\n\r\ncountry  was in danger. That was the only basis  on\r\n\r\nwhich this House could be summoned. The country was\r\n\r\nin   danger.  Public  interest  demanded  that  the\r\n\r\nAssembly do meet in order that the Assembly do give\r\n\r\nguidance to the Hon. the Prime Minister to meet the\r\n\r\ncountry's    perils,   to   solve   the   country's\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  So we came here expectantly,  hoping\r\n\r\nto  help  the Prime Minister to solve his problems,\r\n\r\nbecause his problems are our problems, if they  are\r\n\r\nnational  problems. But what do we hear  from  him?\r\n\r\nNothing  urgently national. All this  trouble  with\r\n\r\nhis Party; all the troubles about the non-Communist\r\n\r\nLeft  and the Communist Left. They are all  members\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. though-this non-Communist Left  and\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  Left. So it seems  a  purely  party\r\n\r\nproblem. Somebody has stabbed the Prime Minister in\r\n\r\nthe  back in the Anson by-election, and he has lost\r\n\r\nthe  Anson by-election. Therefore, it is a national\r\n\r\ncalamity. Therefore, we are brought into the House.\r\n\r\nSo   far  as  the  Opposition  are  concerned,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the P.A.P. can disappear tomorrow and\r\n\r\nwe  will  not consider it a national calamity.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are  entitled to think that it might  be  a\r\n\r\ngreat  loss to the nation. That is their view.  But\r\n\r\nto convene the House and say, \"Somebody has stabbed\r\n\r\nus  in  the  back.  Six of our  members  are  being\r\n\r\ndifficult. One of our Parliamentary Secretaries  is\r\n\r\nnot being the gentleman we thought he was, in spite\r\n\r\nof  his  medical  training,\" that is  none  of  our\r\n\r\nbusiness.   But,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  when   three\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretaries are alleged to have stabbed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government in the back and are alleged to have\r\n\r\nattacked  the  Government in  public,  and  when  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary,  particularly   the   one\r\n\r\nattached  to  the  Minister for Home  Affairs,  has\r\n\r\ndisagreed  with the Government openly and publicly,\r\n\r\nthen it becomes our business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these four issues have become\r\n\r\nour  concern, and I ask our Prime Minister what  he\r\n\r\nhas  done about them. He is playing a sort of  game\r\n\r\nwith  these three Political Secretaries.  Each  one\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"You resign.\" \"No, I will not resign.  You\r\n\r\ntell me to resign.\" It is as if a game is going on,\r\n\r\nSir, each one waiting for the other to make a move.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  this, Sir? Are we playing a game  in  our\r\n\r\nbackyard? Does the Prime Minister not realise  that\r\n\r\nthese  are  national matters?  He  is  not  playing\r\n\r\nparlour  games at the moment. These men  are  being\r\n\r\npaid out of public funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, this document which the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Deputy Prime Minister has  laid  on  the\r\n\r\nTable  is a very interesting document. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  if  you have the document, would you be  good\r\n\r\nenough  to take it and look at the date of it?  The\r\n\r\ndate  is the 12th of August, 1959, two months after\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. came into power, and well  before  the\r\n\r\nBudget  debate.  This is what the  secret  document\r\n\r\nsays about Lim Ching Siong. Paragraph 5 on page  2, Mr Speaker, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Of the eight men released, the most important\r\n\r\nfrom  the  security point of view is Mr  Lim  Chin\r\n\r\nSiong  for he was the person built up as  the  open\r\n\r\nfront leader by the M.C.P. in 1955-1956.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  was  the report of the P.A.P. Government  to\r\n\r\nthe  Internal  Security  Council  on  the  12th  of\r\n\r\nAugust,   1959.  The  question  of  the   Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries, Mr Speaker, Sir, was debated here  at\r\n\r\nlength during the Budget Session in December  1959.\r\n\r\nWhen  questions  were  raised about  the  Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries, the need to appoint them and the  type\r\n\r\nof  persons  that were to be appointed,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, with his tongue in his cheek - now that  we\r\n\r\nknow  about this document - told the House, \"Oh, they\r\n\r\nare good chaps. They will put\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacross our policies to the people.\" What sort of  a\r\n\r\ngame was the Prime Minister playing with the House,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I ask you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He was taking you for a ride!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> He did not take us for a ride, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. He took the people of Singapore for a\r\n\r\nride.  And the people of Singapore will not forgive\r\n\r\nhim  for that. We might forgive him, but the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore will not. There are indications  that\r\n\r\nthey  are not forgiving him. And if he goes  on  at\r\n\r\nthis  rate,  there  are sure signs  they  will  not\r\n\r\nforgive  him. We expect the Prime Minister to  play\r\n\r\nthe  game  by the country. When the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nputs  out  this  document to the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil and then comes and tells the House  what  a\r\n\r\ntrustworthy  man Mr Lim Ching Siong is,  and  then\r\n\r\nputs  him  in  the  Ministry of Finance,  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, what may I ask did the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister intend? Did he intend Mr Lim Ching  Siong\r\n\r\nto  play chess with the Minister for Finance?  What\r\n\r\ngames did Mr Lim Ching Siong in fact play with the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They do not talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> They do not talk? I understand the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance has played  chess  with  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs and so understands his game well. I suggest\r\n\r\nagain  through  you,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance this time that he might have a\r\n\r\ngame  or two of chess with Mr Lim Ching Siong.  If\r\n\r\nhe  had played a game or two of chess with him,  he\r\n\r\nmight  have  found out what sort of a man  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing Siong is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nmade  his  announcement  that  there  was  a  water\r\n\r\nshortage and asked the people to save water and not\r\n\r\nto  waste  it, the leader of the Alliance  wrote  a\r\n\r\nletter  to the Deputy Prime Minister, as Leader  of\r\n\r\nthe  House, suggesting to him that the shortage  of\r\n\r\nwater supply\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  of such a nature and of such importance to the\r\n\r\npublic  interest that it merited the recall of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. But, of course, the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nrefused  the request. He said it was not  important\r\n\r\nat  all. And yet the Prime Minister has brought  us\r\n\r\nhere, Mr Speaker, Sir, not because of any national\r\n\r\ncalamity that is about to befall us or to beset us,\r\n\r\nbut  because he wants us to solve his little  party\r\n\r\npersonal problems. I entirely agree with the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  that the question  of  the  trial  of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members and the leadership of the P.A.P  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  matter  for us. If they want  an  impartial\r\n\r\nChairman,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I venture  to  suggest\r\n\r\nthey  should go to somebody else, and not  to  you.\r\n\r\nSince  they  cannot trust the chairmanship  to  Dr\r\n\r\nToh, I think they will have to go to somebody else.\r\n\r\nBut to bring the whole House here in order to force\r\n\r\na  vote  of  confidence on the Government,  because\r\n\r\nthere are defections in his own party group, is,  I\r\n\r\nregret   to  say,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  using   the\r\n\r\nparliamentary machine to solve the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\npersonal  difficulties. It is a complete  abuse  of\r\n\r\nthe process of parliamentary government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what exactly did the Prime Minister tell us?\r\n\r\nHe  spoke to us for about 55 precious minutes,  and\r\n\r\nhe  said  precious  little. All he  said  were  two\r\n\r\nthings:  \"We  do  not  intend  to  take  repressive\r\n\r\nmeasures  against the Communists. Our  duty  is  to\r\n\r\npreserve  the P.A.P.\" That was his song;  that  was\r\n\r\nhis  line; and that was what he repeated  over  and\r\n\r\nover again in his inimitable English. Over and over\r\n\r\nagain,  \"We  are not going to fight the Communists.\r\n\r\nWe  are going to let the British fight them, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  our business to fight the Communists. They are\r\n\r\nabout  to cut our throats, but we do not care about\r\n\r\nthat.  We  will let the British come and stop  them\r\n\r\nfrom   cutting  our  throats.\"  That  was   how   I\r\n\r\nunderstood  the Prime Minister. He says  his  first\r\n\r\njob is to preserve his Party. Let the country go to\r\n\r\nthe dogs, it does not matter. He has already let it\r\n\r\ngo  to the dogs once before, you may remember,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   ex-Minister  for  National  Development   was\r\n\r\nmisbehaving himself. He misbehaved himself for well\r\n\r\nover  a year before the Prime Minister sacked  him.\r\n\r\nHe  nearly  brought  the country  to  a  standstill\r\n\r\nbefore the Prime Minister acted. The Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwaited for a suitable opportunity to sack him.  The\r\n\r\nsuitable  opportunity was not in relevance  to  the\r\n\r\nState, Mr Speaker, Sir, It was in relevance to his\r\n\r\nown  position  in the Party. When the  proper  time\r\n\r\ncame,  he sacked him. And now he thinks it  is  the\r\n\r\nproper  time again to use the parliamentary machine\r\n\r\nto solve his own personal difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to say very much more. I think\r\n\r\nI  have said enough. Time is getting on and  it  is\r\n\r\nalready  3 o'clock in the morning. By the time  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  finishes,  it  might  well  be   4\r\n\r\no'clock. But I want to say this, Mr Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nWe  are not interested in the personal squabbles of\r\n\r\nthe  People's Action Party. But to the extent  that\r\n\r\ntheir  personal  squabbles are  matters  of  public\r\n\r\ninterest  in so far as the Ministers are concerned,\r\n\r\nand if as a result of the personal squabbles in the\r\n\r\nParty  the  Ministers lose the faith and confidence\r\n\r\nof their Back-benchers, then it becomes a matter of\r\n\r\ninterest  to  the Assembly as a whole  and  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry at large. In parliamentary practice if  the\r\n\r\nMinisters have not got the faith, the following and\r\n\r\nthe confidence of the Party, then there is only one\r\n\r\ncourse  open to them, and who knows it better  than\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister himself, who is so well skilled\r\n\r\nin  constitutional practice? But this I will ask of\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister, that so long as he is the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  he  should act the Prime Minister  as  he\r\n\r\nbelongs  to the State of Singapore first.  He  must\r\n\r\nnot  put  his party interests before those  of  his\r\n\r\ncountry.  I  am  entitled to  demand  this  of  him\r\n\r\nbecause  I speak for the country on this matter.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  speak  as  a Party man.  I  speak  as  one\r\n\r\ninterested in parliamentary democracy; and  in  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary democratic system the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nbelongs  to  the  country first and  to  his  Party\r\n\r\nafterwards. Let him act the Prime Minister  and  we\r\n\r\nwill support him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister, in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.57 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nsurprised  to hear from the Members of  this  House\r\n\r\nthat  the motion has been brought into this Chamber\r\n\r\nbecause of a domestic quarrel in the P.A.P. We have\r\n\r\nspent, in a record session, 13 solid hours on  this\r\n\r\nmotion, which quite clearly has agitated everybody.\r\n\r\nI  say, let us not confuse the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nA  collision of ideological forces has taken place.\r\n\r\nNobody  knows what the end result is going  to  be.\r\n\r\nBut  what we do know is that we are in for a  rough\r\n\r\ntime.  Whether this Government continues in  office\r\n\r\nbecause  of  certain inroads made by the  Communist\r\n\r\nLeft into the will to resist of certain members  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. back-benchers  becomes  a  matter   of\r\n\r\nsurvival  of the Government. That is why the  House\r\n\r\nis in session. Very simply, as I have written to my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Leader of the  House,  before  the\r\n\r\nbattle  is  joined, as I think it  inevitably  must\r\n\r\nnow,  you  have  to be sure that  the  people  will\r\n\r\nfollow you into battle. I have the assurance of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  that they are prepared to  do  this.  I\r\n\r\nhave come to this Assembly in order that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen can publicly declare where they  stand.\r\n\r\nI  am not interested, Mr Speaker, Sir, as has been\r\n\r\nsuggested by some P.A.P. Assemblymen, in continuing\r\n\r\nin  office on the strength of the Opposition.  They\r\n\r\nknow,  and I know, that that is the surest  way  to\r\n\r\npolitical demise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was disappointed to listen to the evasive\r\n\r\nrejoinders that have been made to the speech I made\r\n\r\nin  moving my motion - disappointed because  all  the\r\n\r\nspeakers  were  reading  set  speeches  which  were\r\n\r\nrendered out of date by the new situation which has\r\n\r\narisen  as a result of our disclosing the facts  to\r\n\r\nthe people. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  is not very sensitive in guessing the \r\n\r\nunder-currents of the political forces now in tussle.  If\r\n\r\nhe were aware, as I think it is my duty to make him\r\n\r\nand  the people of Singapore aware, that if we  are\r\n\r\nnot careful we shall run into a first-class crisis,\r\n\r\nthen  I think he would not have treated this debate\r\n\r\nin the frivolous manner that he did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a feeling that in these matters perhaps\r\n\r\nsome  Members  do  not  wish  to  face  up  to  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  The  Parliamentary Secretaries  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistries  of  Health and Home  Affairs  and  some\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Assemblymen have taken the line that  there\r\n\r\nis  no  necessity  for the vote of confidence,  and\r\n\r\nhave  requested  me  to  withdraw  the  motion.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  they  do not wish to have to  say  openly,\r\n\r\nyes,  they are going into battle. Well, that  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  for  them to decide. I say the  moment  for\r\n\r\ndecision has now come. They did not wish to  resign\r\n\r\nwhen after Hong Lim it was suggested that we should\r\n\r\nreturn  the  mandate  to  the  electorate.  I   now\r\n\r\ndiscover  that  what they want is  to  capture  the\r\n\r\npower which we, the present leadership, won for the\r\n\r\nParty  in 1959. It is our duty to see that  no  one\r\n\r\nperverts  this  power for any other  purposes  than\r\n\r\nthose for what the people voted it. If they want to\r\n\r\nassume  power and are prepared to face the  hazards\r\n\r\nthat  have  been  outlined  by  my  colleague   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance,  then  let  them  call  for\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections so that they can seek  authority\r\n\r\nfrom  the people, and not usurp the power from  us.\r\n\r\nIf  they  wish to take this course, let  them  vote\r\n\r\nagainst  the motion. There is no question  of  this\r\n\r\nmotion  being withdrawn. We are going  into  recess\r\n\r\ntill  the end of October and we have to know  where\r\n\r\nthe country stands. When carried, today's vote will\r\n\r\ngive  the  Government the constitutional  right  to\r\n\r\ncarry on. But we ourselves have clearly stated that\r\n\r\nit  is  the moral authority and the support of  the\r\n\r\npeople  that  is  so  vital for  good  and  orderly\r\n\r\ngovernment.  It  is therefore our business  at  \r\n\r\nan appropriate  time, after taking such steps  as  are\r\n\r\nnecessary in the long term interest of the  people,\r\n\r\nto  return  the power back to the people  in  order\r\n\r\nthat  they can decide on who should guide them  and\r\n\r\nwhither they should go. Most important in the  next\r\n\r\nfew   months   is  our  business  to  present   the\r\n\r\nconditions  for  merger to the  people.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  I can assist Members on the other side  of\r\n\r\nthe  House by explaining why, in my submission,  we\r\n\r\nare  unlikely  to  establish these  conditions  for\r\n\r\nmerger if we act as the former Government did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I quote, Mr Speaker, Sir, from a political\r\n\r\nstatement we made at the beginning of this year  in\r\n\r\nwhich  I  hope, if Members opposite have the  time,\r\n\r\nthey might find some elucidation? On page 6 of  the 1960 Anniversary Souvenir number, we said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Merger between the Federation and Singapore is\r\n\r\nhistorically inevitable. The man made  boundary  at\r\n\r\nthe  Straits of Johore will disappear as  must  all\r\n\r\nthe  other  freak colonial frontiers bequeathed  to\r\n\r\nnewly  independent colonial territories by the  map\r\n\r\ndrawers and surveyors of the colonial era.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is simply that the Federation cannot\r\n\r\nafford to have a hostile Singapore. So far we  have\r\n\r\nemphasised  the  importance of  the  Federation  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Lest there is any danger of  forgetting\r\n\r\nit,   let  us  remind  people  that  Singapore   is\r\n\r\nimportant   to   the  Federation   militarily   and\r\n\r\npolitically.  Militarily and politically  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  Federation are one unit. Colonialism  has\r\n\r\nmade  a  technically international frontier on  the\r\n\r\nStraits  of Johore and created two states.  But  no\r\n\r\nsoldier  can  devise a front to make Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  two  instead  of   one   military\r\n\r\nsituation.   He   who  conquers   Malaya   conquers\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The Japanese proved it. And  conversely\r\n\r\nhe  who  holds  Singapore absorbs Malaya.  Stamford\r\n\r\nRaffles   proved  it.  Perhaps  it  is   worthwhile\r\n\r\nremembering  that it is the same British  Army,  on\r\n\r\nboth   sides  of  the  causeway,  though   on   the\r\n\r\nFederation  side  it  is  there  by  invitation  on\r\n\r\nfriendly  defence treaty with the Federation  Army.\r\n\r\nAnd  no  politician  has yet devised  a  method  to\r\n\r\nprevent  news and events from spreading across  the\r\n\r\ncauseway. Every political action in the Federation,\r\n\r\nin  language,  education, taxation, and  all  other\r\n\r\nfields  of government, affects and has repercussion\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  And the converse  is  equally  true\r\n\r\nhowever  much  people  may  try  to  minimise   the\r\n\r\nreactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... this delicate balance cannot last forever. The\r\n\r\npresent  balance of power and forces is an  interim\r\n\r\none.  For  finally  the  Federation  and  Singapore\r\n\r\npositions  will  have  to  be  contained   by   one\r\n\r\nauthority, or the Federation will run the  risk  of\r\n\r\nhaving Singapore fall into hostile hands and  later\r\n\r\nhave  to face more dangerous military and political\r\n\r\nconsequences.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain simply that if we are to win this\r\n\r\nbattle  in men's minds, it is not a simple question\r\n\r\nas   the  Member  for  Thomson  has  suggested,  of\r\n\r\nprovoking  a  riot and then doing a purge,  because\r\n\r\nthe  end  result  of  having provoked  a  riot  and\r\n\r\nexecuted  a purge is to have failed in the argument\r\n\r\nin  the  minds of the people. I do not know who  is\r\n\r\nthe more courageous - the man who knows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  course  of events that are likely to  develop,\r\n\r\nwho  knows  that the malady is likely to get  worse\r\n\r\nbefore  it  gets  better,  who  calmly  faces  that\r\n\r\nprospect  and is prepared for the rigours  that  he\r\n\r\nwill go through; and the other who in alarm takes a\r\n\r\nshort-cut,  and  thus a purgative. Whoever  is  the\r\n\r\nmore  courageous - I have no doubt whatsoever,  which\r\n\r\nof the two is the wiser course: getting home to the\r\n\r\npeople,  not  this froth that Communism   is  evil,\r\n\r\nthat  they  are all evil men talking villainy,  but\r\n\r\nthe  real  truth  that Communism  is  a  tremendous\r\n\r\nchallenge that has to be met, that it is a  battle\r\n\r\nfor  men's minds and loyalties. I have seen in this\r\n\r\nvery Chamber men's minds and loyalties switch under\r\n\r\nthe  heat  and pressure of persuasion, and  perhaps\r\n\r\nsilent  intimidation  by  the  Communist  that  the\r\n\r\nfuture belongs to him, that the east wind is  going\r\n\r\nstronger  than  the west wind,  and  that  when  he\r\n\r\nprevails  one day, he will deal with all those  who\r\n\r\nhave opposed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to my friend, the Member for Thomson, I\r\n\r\nfind  it  difficult to believe that two years  ago,\r\n\r\nbefore  we  took office, I spent a whole week  with\r\n\r\nhim  up in the mountains and presented him with the\r\n\r\nperils that we would encounter when we took office.\r\n\r\nHe  was  a non-Communist. He fought with me in  the\r\n\r\nS.T.C.  Union  to prevent that union  from  failing\r\n\r\nunder Communist domination. He knew what the perils\r\n\r\nwere.  He  knows  what  is  Communism.  He  is   no\r\n\r\nopportunist. And he made up his mind  that  he  was\r\n\r\ncoming  with us. One year ago, after constant  heat\r\n\r\nand pressure from the Communists, he came to see me\r\n\r\nin  hospital where I was convalescing from a  minor\r\n\r\noperation, and, in the presence of two others, said\r\n\r\nthat  he thought it was a great mistake our  having\r\n\r\nassumed power under these circumstances and that we\r\n\r\nshould  vacate. He was fighting the Communists  and\r\n\r\nhaving  a  tough  time. Then one  day,  two  months\r\n\r\nlater,  after he came back from England, he decided\r\n\r\nthat he was on the wrong side and that he was going\r\n\r\nover to the side that was going to win. He told  me\r\n\r\nquite frankly that he thinks the Communists\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare bound to win, that he is not prepared to be  an\r\n\r\nanti-Communist  or  to  have  a  fight  with  them.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  he insisted that we must do this,  that\r\n\r\nand the other. Then our ideological troubles began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a serious problem that we face because we\r\n\r\nare   tapping  from  the  same  oilfield   as   the\r\n\r\nCommunists. The choice for democratic socialism  is\r\n\r\neither  to battle for your political activists  who\r\n\r\nhave  convictions,  guts,  energy,  enthusiasm  and\r\n\r\ndrive,  and  who  are motivated not  altogether  by\r\n\r\npersonal   considerations;  or  to  rely   on   men\r\n\r\nmotivated for purely selfish motives, for position,\r\n\r\npower  and profit. Therefore we tap from  the  same\r\n\r\noilfield. There is no person now on the P.A.P. side\r\n\r\nwho  can  say he did not know what he was  in  for.\r\n\r\nEveryone,  before  he  came  in,  signed  a  solemn\r\n\r\ndocument  that  he stood by the principles  of  the\r\n\r\nParty  and,  in  particular, stood  by  the  Fourth\r\n\r\nAnniversary Souvenir number wherein we made a clear\r\n\r\ndemarcation line between where we stood  and  where\r\n\r\nthe Communists stood. I never believed that I would\r\n\r\nhear  the  Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home Affairs mouth words and phrases which  he\r\n\r\nbarely  understands, and give an analysis  which  I\r\n\r\nthink  deep down in his heart he knows is spurious.\r\n\r\nBut he has been convinced that that is the easy way\r\n\r\nout,  and  so the rot sets in. The will  to  resist\r\n\r\ndisappears and they say, \"In the name of democracy,\r\n\r\nsocialism,  intra-party democracy, let  us  go  and\r\n\r\nfloat with them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the crisis - a crisis which even the\r\n\r\ndemocratic States in Western Europe are  facing,  a\r\n\r\ncrisis   which   certainly  we  are   facing.   The\r\n\r\nalternatives  are, either to have  a  Labour  Front\r\n\r\ntype government with Lib-Socs, consisting of people\r\n\r\nwho  are  relatively effete, who can be bought  and\r\n\r\nsold  across the counter, and who will buy and sell\r\n\r\nothers,  or  to tap the same half per cent  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  which  is politically  alert.  We  have\r\n\r\ntapped them, everyone of them. Today the eight  who\r\n\r\nhave  dissented from us are men who have moved into\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworld, the no-man's-land between the Communists and\r\n\r\nus,  the  unions and the mass organisations,  where\r\n\r\nwords like \"socialism\" mean Communism or democratic\r\n\r\nsocialism, where things are hazy, where you do  not\r\n\r\nwant  them  to be clear, but where they  are  clear\r\n\r\nenough  when you speak to each other in the  hidden\r\n\r\nlanguage  which those who are initiated understand.\r\n\r\nThat is the crisis we are faced with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle for the control of the P.A.P. as a\r\n\r\nParty  is not a problem. That will be resolved.  We\r\n\r\nare  veterans of many a battle since the Party  was\r\n\r\nfirst  formed in 1954, and I have informed some  of\r\n\r\nmy  friends  behind me that we are unmoved  at  the\r\n\r\nprospect  of another battle. It is not  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthat is in danger, because we have built in all the\r\n\r\nsafeguards. We know, in tapping the oilfield,  that\r\n\r\nexplosions may occur from time to time and we  have\r\n\r\ntaken the necessary precautions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, men who joined the Party like the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries  in  the  Ministries  of\r\n\r\nHealth and Home Affairs only recently in 1959, when\r\n\r\nour  star  was  in the ascendent, are  rattled  and\r\n\r\nshaken  to  the  point  of  contemplating  changing\r\n\r\nstands  by the temporary setbacks in Hong  Lim  and\r\n\r\nAnson.  They  do not understand that the  political\r\n\r\nleadership,  if it is to survive, must be  resolute\r\n\r\nand  must be prepared to face up to unpleasantness.\r\n\r\nWe  have  sufficient  confidence  in  the  ultimate\r\n\r\ntriumph  of our analysis and the fact that  because\r\n\r\nthe  analysis is correct we are more likely to have\r\n\r\nthe  appropriate political strategy. Let  everybody\r\n\r\ntake  his  stand in the knowledge that  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible to insure with both sides: the P.A.P.,  if\r\n\r\ndemocratic  socialism continues, or the Communists,\r\n\r\nif   Communism  triumphs.  We  in  the  leadership,\r\n\r\nwhatever  our multifarious shortcomings  which  our\r\n\r\nerstwhile   admirers   and  followers   have   been\r\n\r\nlabouring this evening, have nailed our colours  to\r\n\r\nthe mast several years ago before we took power  in\r\n\r\nthe last elections. Those who are contemplating  an\r\n\r\nassault  on  the  P.A.P. citadel  should  carefully\r\n\r\nconsider the injuries they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  be inflicting on themselves and on  us,  and\r\n\r\nalso their chances of ultimate success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time this House reconvenes, Mr Speaker, we\r\n\r\nhope  everybody will have appraised  themselves  of\r\n\r\nthe facts of life in Malaya as they really are, and\r\n\r\nwill  have prepared themselves psychologically  for\r\n\r\nthe  decisions  they will have  to  make  on  their\r\n\r\nfuture;   for  on  the  people's  decision  depends\r\n\r\nwhether  this  little experiment in  representative\r\n\r\ngovernment in Singapore survives or withers away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has insinuated that this is a\r\n\r\ngovernment of job-seekers, that we want to carry on\r\n\r\nin  office after the electorate has rejected us  on\r\n\r\ntwo  occasions. And he went further and accused  me\r\n\r\nof  wishing to remain Prime Minister come what may.\r\n\r\nI  wish  it were true, that I get as much enjoyment\r\n\r\nout  of being Prime Minister as he did out of being\r\n\r\nChief  Minister, it is not the sensation  of  power\r\n\r\nthat  fills  me with elation. To abscond  now  when\r\n\r\ntrouble brews would be an act of cowardice, and  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  have  asked me to  carry  on  and  have\r\n\r\nassured  me that they are prepared to come together\r\n\r\nin  the  battle. I myself was of the opinion  after\r\n\r\nHong Lim that the best thing for the country was  a\r\n\r\nfresh  election  and  another government,  probably\r\n\r\nstill a P.A.P. one with a fresh mandate. Because we\r\n\r\nhave  insuperable problems to resolve and they  can\r\n\r\nonly  be  resolved  if  the  government  has  moral\r\n\r\nauthority  to  govern.  But now,  faced  with  this\r\n\r\nchallenge   of  capture  and  perversion   of   the\r\n\r\ngovernment  under  the  P.A.P. banner,  a   silent\r\n\r\ntransfer of the driver and a change in direction, I\r\n\r\nsay  it  is  our business to stay put and  see  the\r\n\r\nthing  through  as  quickly  as  we  can  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Political Secretaries, Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink  the Member for Farrer Park made one valuable\r\n\r\npoint - that we knew in August 1959 and we knew well\r\n\r\nbefore  August  1959  the  respective  position  of\r\n\r\neveryone. This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis no smear, no name-calling. It is a waste of time\r\n\r\ncalling names, unless you can nail a man down.  And\r\n\r\nfrom  now  on those who take us on must be prepared\r\n\r\nto  nail us down and be nailed down by us. We  have\r\n\r\nsaid  that.  Let  me read this document  which  the\r\n\r\nLeader of the House has tabled:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Of the eight men released, the most important\r\n\r\nfrom  the  security point of view is Mr  Lim  Chin\r\n\r\nSiong  for he was the person built up as  the  open\r\n\r\nfront leader by the M.C.P. in 1955-1956. Once he is\r\n\r\nreleased, it makes very little difference from  the\r\n\r\npoint  of  view of subversion whether the remaining\r\n\r\nforty-odd  detainees are released  or  not  because\r\n\r\nthey   cannot   materially  affect   the   security\r\n\r\nposition. Whether they be inside detention camps or\r\n\r\noutside   in   active  participation  the   overall\r\n\r\nposition is not basically different. Of the  eight,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government has reasons to believe  that\r\n\r\nfive,  not including Lim Chin Siong, genuinely  and\r\n\r\nsincerely   subscribe  to  the  P.A.P. democratic\r\n\r\nsocialist ideology.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I  do  not think anybody who  has  not  gone\r\n\r\nthrough  the experience of working at ground  level\r\n\r\nwith  these  men  can understand the  metamorphosis\r\n\r\nthat  can  take  place  in men's  minds  and  men's\r\n\r\nintentions.  You can guess what a man is,  but  you\r\n\r\nare never really sure. You can know what a man does\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  an  overt act,  but  his  ultimate\r\n\r\nconviction - whether  he  is  a   Communist,   or   a\r\n\r\nsocialist, or a social democrat - is something  which\r\n\r\nyou  have  to piece together over a long period  of\r\n\r\ntime. Constant and consistent conduct leads you  to\r\n\r\nthe  conclusion  that  a person  is  or  is  not  a\r\n\r\nCommunist. And even if he is at a certain time,  as\r\n\r\nI  have  said of my friend Mr Bani in 1959,  quite\r\n\r\nclearly  he  knew where he stood and he  knew  what\r\n\r\nCommunism  was  about because he has been  fighting\r\n\r\nthis and has met all these problems before, but  he\r\n\r\ncan  change his opinion, and has a right to  change\r\n\r\nhis opinion. Therefore, when they came out and made\r\n\r\na  declaration on their release on the 4th of June,\r\n\r\nthat  they  stood  firmly and squarely  behind  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and stated their position in print - we  felt\r\n\r\nthat  it was worth a try. It was a battle for men's\r\n\r\nminds. I would say, at the time when Mr Fong  Swee\r\n\r\nSuan  came out from prison on the 4th of  June,  he\r\n\r\nwas  not a Communist, he was a democratic socialist\r\n\r\nwith us. And I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  say  that  at  the  time  he  was  appointed\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretary to the Minister for Labour,  he\r\n\r\nwas  genuinely  and sincerely trying  to  work  the\r\n\r\nsystem.  But  in  the process of  that  battle,  he\r\n\r\nmelted  and  was reformed in their  ranks,  in  the\r\n\r\nemotional   hothouse   of   the   Chinese   Malayan\r\n\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is something which only those who have been\r\n\r\nthrough  the  experience  can  know.  If  you  have\r\n\r\nsquatted  in  the  union, seen the  activists  work\r\n\r\nabsolutely selflessly, day and night, for a  cause,\r\n\r\nutterly ruthless and fanatical, then you understand\r\n\r\nhow  a  man  suddenly melt away. That  is  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening  in  Singapore. That is the  world  which\r\n\r\nMembers  on  the  other side of the  House  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand, except perhaps the three former members\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P.  I think the Member  for  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nunderstands  this very well. As my  colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, has said, having  complained\r\n\r\nof   the   undemocratic  nature   of   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nConstitution  and  of  the  cadre  membership,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim has, from his own experience in\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., drafted and submitted for registration\r\n\r\na  constitution  which  is tighter  and  harder  to\r\n\r\ncapture   than  the  P.A.P.'s.  We  hold  a   cadre\r\n\r\nconference  bi-annually.  He  wants  to  hold   one\r\n\r\ntriennially  and  so on. He has  gone  through  the\r\n\r\nmill. He knows what it is all about. Let us not kid\r\n\r\nourselves  about intra-party democracy.  Every  man\r\n\r\nwho complains of it signed his application form for\r\n\r\nmembership  that  \"I  accept  the  rules   of   the\r\n\r\nconstitution.\"   He   knew   what   was   in    the\r\n\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know how the game is played. We allowed free\r\n\r\nplay on the ground in order to tap the neutrals, to\r\n\r\nbring  the  activists into action in our  branches.\r\n\r\nBut  we  also  run  the risk - and  we  know  that - of\r\n\r\ngetting  chaps  planted in.  Therefore,  the  first\r\n\r\nentree is not the ground organisation in the  open.\r\n\r\nIt  can be compared if you like to the Pope and his\r\n\r\npontiffs. The cardinals appoint the Pope; the  Pope\r\n\r\nappoints  the  cardinals. It is a system  that  has\r\n\r\nexisted  some  2,000 years and there must  be  some\r\n\r\nmerit  in it. The Communists have that system  too.\r\n\r\nAnd I say,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif you try to run the democratic system of the mass\r\n\r\npolitical  party, unless it is a  party  not  worth\r\n\r\ncapturing,  like the Labour Front  or  S.P.A.,  you\r\n\r\nwill  have  no  end of trouble. We  are  worth  the\r\n\r\ncapture; that is the point. We have spent two years\r\n\r\nin  office, and the Party is still ticking. We went\r\n\r\ndown  in  Hong Lim and I think the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim knows - win or lose - we gave him a fight for seven\r\n\r\nweeks.  The organisation is there, it is worth  the\r\n\r\ncapture. And I say to them who are thinking of\r\n\r\nit - think again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important now for me to answer why\r\n\r\nwe  took them in. We took a chance. We lost out  in\r\n\r\nseveral  cases.  It is a risk that was  calculated,\r\n\r\nand so it has to be. It may be that many interested\r\n\r\npeople will say that what we, have disclosed  is  a\r\n\r\nfairy tale. I do not think the Member for Anson  is\r\n\r\nan  interested person. But I think there  are  many\r\n\r\ninterested  persons who would like to repeat  that,\r\n\r\nand  if  they could get him to repeat it  and  help\r\n\r\nmore people to repeat it, to make them believe  it,\r\n\r\nit  will help to cloud the issue. Those of  us  who\r\n\r\nhave lived through the events of the mass agitation\r\n\r\nof  the last few years, especially since 1955, know\r\n\r\nthat this is not a bogey but an ogre which can send\r\n\r\nthe creeps into a man's soul. They can put the fear\r\n\r\nof  God  into intelligent people and convince  them\r\n\r\nthat the future belongs to them. Hence the weak and\r\n\r\nwobbly  line  taken  by some of the  speakers  this\r\n\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with sadness that I watch these men who have\r\n\r\nbeen  my friends and comrades, some for many years.\r\n\r\nBut  most  of  them  are the newer  members.  Their\r\n\r\nresolution  melted  as  the  heat  of  the   battle\r\n\r\nintensified.  They are not crooks and  rogues  like\r\n\r\nthose  who sat on the last Government benches,  but\r\n\r\nthey lacked sternness of purpose in the face\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  an  adversary  who mounts a massive  effort  at\r\n\r\npersuasion and the silent intimidation  of  who  is\r\n\r\nthe  winner in the long run. But I am proud to  say\r\n\r\nthat many have stood up to the test of the occasion\r\n\r\nas  the effort against us is mounted, and some feel\r\n\r\nso  strongly that they have come out from  hospital\r\n\r\nto  cast  a  vote tonight. It is not for  fun,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that these things are done. It is not\r\n\r\nto  settle  a party conflict. That can  be  settled\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  built in the safeguards  in  the\r\n\r\nconstitution of the Party. They can rock us, damage\r\n\r\nus;  but so can we them. But if a silent conversion\r\n\r\nis  made  in  this Chamber, then I say the  country\r\n\r\nwill rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here a series of extracts from the\r\n\r\ndocument  signed by the three political Secretaries\r\n\r\ntogether  with Mr Devan Nair, and Mr  Chan  Chiaw\r\n\r\nThor when they were released. And I say - I have said\r\n\r\nit  before - that it was on the basis of this written\r\n\r\nundertaking of where they stood that they came into\r\n\r\nthe  Government  with us. And if  they  move  their\r\n\r\nstand  from this, then we must part company. It  is\r\n\r\nnot   a  manifestation  of  courage  just  to  sack\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretaries and make martyrs out of them.\r\n\r\nThey  have been my friends and colleagues over many\r\n\r\nyears  in  a common struggle. They have  chosen  to\r\n\r\nbetray us. But even in moments of anger I think  we\r\n\r\nshould   act  soberly  and  calmly  and  not   make\r\n\r\nunnecessary martyrs out of people. Let me read what\r\n\r\nthey said: Page 1, paragraph 2 of the statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With regard to immediate tasks, particularly in\r\n\r\nthe  new  phase since the achievement of  political\r\n\r\nindependence  by  the  Federation  of  Malaya,   we\r\n\r\nendorse  the  stand  taken by  the  P.A.P. in  the\r\n\r\ndocument \"The New Phase After Merdeka - Our Tasks and\r\n\r\nPolicy\" published in the 1958 annual souvenir issue\r\n\r\nof the Party.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Page 2, second paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The real struggle for socialism in Malaya can\r\n\r\nonly   begin  when  our  people,  Malays,  Chinese,\r\n\r\nIndians are able to transcend the communal cultural\r\n\r\nand  linguistic  barriers and  loyalties  which  at\r\n\r\npresent  divide them, and embrace a common  Malayan\r\n\r\nloyalty    and   cultivate   a   common    national\r\n\r\nconsciousness.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPage 3, paragraph 4:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It would be a mistake to regard the non-inclusion\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  in  the  independent  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  as  being due solely to British  chicanery.\r\n\r\nThe  British, of course, cannot escape their  share\r\n\r\nof  responsibility for this cruel  amputation.  The\r\n\r\nfact  remains,  however,  that  the  exclusion   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  also the reflection of  the  genuine\r\n\r\nfear  of the Malay majority in the Federation  that\r\n\r\nthe Chinese majority in Singapore are incapable  of\r\n\r\na  Malaya-centred loyalty and cannot be assimilated\r\n\r\ninto  a Malaya-centred nationalism. It is up to  us\r\n\r\nin Singapore to prove that the fears and suspicions\r\n\r\nof  our  Malay  brethren across  the  causeway  are\r\n\r\ngroundless.  In  the words of the  P.A.P.'s  policy\r\n\r\nstatement, \"The New Phase After Merdeka\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  here they quoted this and adopted it as  their\r\n\r\nown:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"It must be demonstrated to three million Malays\r\n\r\nin  the Federation that the one million Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  ready,  willing  and  able  to   be\r\n\r\nabsorbed  as one Malayan people, all able to  speak\r\n\r\nMalay,  and  willing  to  work  together  for   the\r\n\r\neconomic betterment and upliftment of the Malays as\r\n\r\nequals of the other races.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  this is what is interesting. Page 5, paragraph\r\n\r\n3:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It was not the might of British arms which\r\n\r\ndefeated  the armed revolt led by the  M.C.P.,  but\r\n\r\nthe failure of the M.C.P. to establish itself as  a\r\n\r\nnationally  based  movement. And  thereby  hangs  a\r\n\r\nlesson  which  Malayan socialists  will  ignore  at\r\n\r\ntheir peril.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  I  say, on this issue of merger, if they could\r\n\r\nignore  it, they would fight it at their peril.  In\r\n\r\nthe last paragraph, page 6, they said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With the achievement of political independence by\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya, a new phase has begun.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  am  afraid,  Sir, they have not  quite  adjusted\r\n\r\nthemselves to this new phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has said that Mr Lim Ching\r\n\r\nSiong  does  not  oppose  merger.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson has asked me to quote any single reference,\r\n\r\nany  single line which is hostile to merger. I  say\r\n\r\nthe  open conflict would never have taken place and\r\n\r\nthey  would never have been so stupid as to  betray\r\n\r\nus,  and dealt us a treacherous blow in Anson,  but\r\n\r\nfor  the  fact that they were bitterly  opposed  to\r\n\r\nmerger or super\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerger.   It  is  on  this  basic  and  fundamental\r\n\r\ndivision that we have now parted ways. Let me quote\r\n\r\nyou a series of extracts, Mr Speaker, Sir, to show\r\n\r\nwhere  they  really stand on merger, although  from\r\n\r\ntime  to time, because it is such a difficult issue\r\n\r\non  which to back-pedal, wobbling has taken  place.\r\n\r\nOn  the  13th  of June, Mr Lim together  with  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson  and  four  others  issued   a\r\n\r\nstatement which can only be taken as a challenge to\r\n\r\nthe statement made by the Chairman of the P.A.P. on\r\n\r\nthe  9th  of  June. They stated  that  it  must  be\r\n\r\nunderstood that any constitutional arrangement that\r\n\r\nfrustrates  the people's struggle for  freedom  and\r\n\r\ndemocracy will be resisted by the people. Here they\r\n\r\nare  saying  that  merger, independence,  something\r\n\r\nwhich  is  almost a dogma with the P.A.P. and  all\r\n\r\nsocialists,  is  a sell-out. \"understood  that  any\r\n\r\nconstitutional arrangement that frustrates\" freedom\r\n\r\nand   democracy;  going  in  as  a  State  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation to freedom; frustrating democracy.  What\r\n\r\nare we talking about? Then on the 24th of June, Mr\r\n\r\nLim in a letter to the Straits Times said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Merger, we have hitherto come to understand, was\r\n\r\na  thing  of  the  distant future. However,  recent\r\n\r\nstatements by leaders of the Federation hold out an\r\n\r\nearlier   promise  of  the  union  of   these   two\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encouraging as it is, the question now arises, on\r\n\r\nwhat  terms  will this be effected? The  right-wing\r\n\r\ngovernment  in  the  Federation  and  a   left-wing\r\n\r\ngovernment  in Singapore apply certain  conflicting\r\n\r\nprinciples.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>All  kinds of difficulties are now contemplated and\r\n\r\nenvisaged because obviously somebody does not  like\r\n\r\nit. He went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Merger is a matter that must be worked out to a\r\n\r\ngreat  degree of clarity. It is not a thing  to  be\r\n\r\naccepted without firmly defined purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great sacrifices have been made by the people to\r\n\r\nachieve  their  present position in  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nmerger  must  never turn out to a sell-out  of  any\r\n\r\nsort.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>How  can  merger  be  a  sell-out  when  it  is   a\r\n\r\nproclaimed  objective of the political  party  that\r\n\r\nwon  the last elections with this as a major  plank\r\n\r\nin  its  platform? But then they have their various\r\n\r\nreasons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor   it,   their  different  fears  to  which   my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Minister for Finance, has referred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so we could go on, Mr Speaker, Sir. But I\r\n\r\nthink  this is only the beginning of the  argument.\r\n\r\nAs  I have said, something which perhaps the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park may consider worth contemplating,\r\n\r\nif you lock a man up and you have not divulged what\r\n\r\nhe  represents,  you have left  a  whole  following\r\n\r\nbelieving in that idea. And new leaders will spring\r\n\r\nup and lead the followers with those predilections.\r\n\r\nI say this is an argument which we can win, because\r\n\r\nI think if they oppose merger they will be making a\r\n\r\nmistake  second  only  to  the  starting   of   the\r\n\r\nEmergency in 1948.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that if Singapore goes in with the\r\n\r\nFederation we should have insured Singapore against\r\n\r\nCommunism. That is not the case. All you have  done\r\n\r\nis to stabilise the position, give it a viable base\r\n\r\nfrom  which to build a relatively healthy  society.\r\n\r\nWe  are  left with a dismembered portion of a  once\r\n\r\nsizeable   Empire   which   included   the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories. We governed from Singapore - the British\r\n\r\ndid - Labuan,  North Borneo, the Cocos  Islands  (now\r\n\r\ngone, to Australia), Penang and all the rest of  it\r\n\r\nin  this  region.  And we are  left  with  all  the\r\n\r\nmonuments of a former colonial capital without  the\r\n\r\nwherewithal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say the first objective is to ensure that you\r\n\r\nwin this battle in people's minds. This is the only\r\n\r\nroad  to  survival. It is so. If we cannot convince\r\n\r\nthem  that it is so, then I say the battle is lost.\r\n\r\nAnd  then, of course, brute force will be used. And\r\n\r\nwhy should we use brute force? Because I say it  is\r\n\r\nunnecessary.  The  brute force, anyway,  is  there,\r\n\r\nbecause  this is a S.E.A.T.O. base. If  people  are\r\n\r\nfoolish  enough to believe that they have  got  the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of the island to upset the base,  or  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  have the freedom of the island  provided\r\n\r\nthey  give  a verbal guarantee about the  base  not\r\n\r\nbeing upset, then I wish them well. For my part, as\r\n\r\nI  have stated at the opening, under conditions  of\r\n\r\nabsolute\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsafety  for  the  life and limb of every  political\r\n\r\ncontestant, the raps are on. If we cannot  win  the\r\n\r\nargument,  then we will never win, and I  say  that\r\n\r\nthis is the argument that we have to win. I am  not\r\n\r\nunduly  optimistic  but reasonably  confident  that\r\n\r\nlogic and the inevitable course of events over  the\r\n\r\nnext  few  months  will bring the  two  territories\r\n\r\ninevitably together in closer association - in  what\r\n\r\nform,  I  am  unable to say as yet. The  time  will\r\n\r\ncome,  I  hope, when even sceptics like the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  will be surprised to see the  logic  of\r\n\r\nhistory, geography, the military situation, and the\r\n\r\npolitical situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this motion of confidence, I would like\r\n\r\nto  say that we are prepared to do not what is best\r\n\r\nfor the P.A.P., as has been suggested by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer Park, but what is best for the country.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  best for the P.A.P. is what  I  suggested\r\n\r\nafter  Hong  Lim - to return the mandate.  There  are\r\n\r\ncertain  inescapable problems. The  people  want  a\r\n\r\nrapid  rise in the standard of living. There is  no\r\n\r\nbase  for  your  economic expansion. Your  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  is  restricted.  Your industrialisation  has\r\n\r\ncome  to  depend upon factors beyond your  control,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  Whoever remains in office  bears  the\r\n\r\nodium of failure. After Hong Lim, when it was clear\r\n\r\nthat  the electorate wanted something quick and  it\r\n\r\nwas   not  possible  to  deliver,  I  said  to   my\r\n\r\ncolleagues, \"Return that mandate.\" The people  will\r\n\r\nlearn  as  the  years go on, when the P.A.P. comes\r\n\r\nback  in its pristine glory. We are staying on  not\r\n\r\nfor  the P.A.P., but because we will not allow this\r\n\r\nGovernment to be sold down the drain and the people\r\n\r\nruined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 27; Noes, 8; Abstentions,\r\n\r\n16; Absent, Nil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Ayes.
