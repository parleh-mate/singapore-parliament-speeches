The  first\r\n\r\nmatter   for   decision   was   therefore   whether\r\n\r\npreparations   should  be  made  for   the   direct\r\n\r\nestablishment  of public ownership by  means  of  a\r\n\r\nspecially  constituted public authority or  whether\r\n\r\nas   an  intermediate  step  the  formation  of   a\r\n\r\nstatutory limited liability company should be aimed\r\n\r\nat.  On this, the following progress has been made.\r\n\r\nEnquiries   have  been  made  as  to  whether   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  capital for the formation of a statutory\r\n\r\nlimited   liability  company  was  likely   to   be\r\n\r\nforthcoming   from   an   overseas   company   with\r\n\r\nexperience  of  transport  administration  as   was\r\n\r\nsuggested in paragraph 234 of the report. It  soon,\r\n\r\nhowever,   became  apparent  that  a   satisfactory\r\n\r\nsolution  was  unlikely from  such  a  source.  Mr\r\n\r\nHawkins himself then held a series of personal  and\r\n\r\ninformal  discussions with members of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nBus  Owners' Association. These members at one time\r\n\r\nshowed considerable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterest in the idea of amalgamation into a single\r\n\r\ncompany  but the present indications are that  the\r\n\r\nChinese  bus  owners  are  not  yet  prepared   to\r\n\r\namalgamate  into  a  single  company.  They  have,\r\n\r\nhowever, undertaken to prepare and submit to me  a\r\n\r\nmemorandum  containing alternative  proposals  for\r\n\r\namalgamation.  I  understand that this  memorandum\r\n\r\ncan be expected at any time. The proposals will be\r\n\r\ncarefully  examined and the Government  will  then\r\n\r\ndecide  whether  the alternative  of  a  statutory\r\n\r\nlimited  liability company must be abandoned  and,\r\n\r\nif  so,  the pace at which unification  through  a\r\n\r\npublic  authority should be pursued. This decision\r\n\r\nwill be taken in the very near future and it would\r\n\r\nbe  made in the light of the demands made by other\r\n\r\nimportant development projects on the funds likely\r\n\r\nto be available in the next few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stages which remain to be carried out will, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  depend on the decision to  which  I  have\r\n\r\njust  referred.

I do not think at this stage  I  can\r\n\r\ngive any very useful information about them but  I\r\n\r\ncan,  however,  say  that  in  the  event  of  the\r\n\r\ndecision   being  taken  to  establish  a   public\r\n\r\nauthority,  the first step will be the acquisition\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Traction company  and  we  have\r\n\r\ncommissioned accountants, with the concurrence  of\r\n\r\nthe company, to examine the records of the company\r\n\r\nand  to submit a report which will form the  basis\r\n\r\nof  any  subsequent negotiations for  acquisition.\r\n\r\nThe accountants have been pressed to complete this\r\n\r\nreport  as soon as possible.

Members will recollect that in June of\r\n\r\nlast  year, they gave their unanimous approval  to\r\n\r\nthe scale of fees which was fixed by the Board  of\r\n\r\nArchitects  and brought to them for  approval  and\r\n\r\nthat in dealing with that scale of fees I referred\r\n\r\nalso  to an Architects (Amendment) Ordinance which\r\n\r\nwe  at  that time proposed but which was withdrawn\r\n\r\nas  the  life  of the Assembly was then  extremely\r\n\r\nuncertain. In referring to these fees,  I  pointed\r\n\r\nout  that  the changes in the scale of  fees  were\r\n\r\nonly one stage in a general reassessment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, certain aspects arising from the\r\n\r\noperation  of  the scale of fees have  called  for\r\n\r\nstudy  and have received study and I now  move  an\r\n\r\nArchitects (Amendment) Bill which is significantly\r\n\r\ndifferent from what we proposed in 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 2 we seek to remove from the Board of\r\n\r\nArchitects the power to fix a scale of fees and  I\r\n\r\nthink I had better explain the background to  that\r\n\r\na  little because Members may not be fully in  the\r\n\r\npicture.  The  argument which  has  been  used  to\r\n\r\njustify  a  scale  of fees fixed  under  statutory\r\n\r\npowers  is  that the architects in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  give  a  degree  of  supervision  to\r\n\r\nbuilding works which is not required in many other\r\n\r\ncountries. If hon. Members have in their hands the\r\n\r\n1956  scale  of fees, they will note that  it  was\r\n\r\nthen  laid  down that one-fifth of the total  fees\r\n\r\nwould  be payable on the completion of the  sketch\r\n\r\nplans;  the  balance  up to  two-thirds  when  the\r\n\r\ncontracts  have  been let; and the remaining  one-third   would  be  paid  by  instalments  as   the\r\n\r\narchitect from time to time certified progress  to\r\n\r\nhis  client  for payment to the contractors.  This\r\n\r\nimplies of course that two-thirds (or 5 per  cent)\r\n\r\nof   the  fee  is  appropriate  for  designing   a\r\n\r\nstructure   and  that  2\u00bd  per   cent   is   the\r\n\r\nappropriate fee for supervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are here concerned with the supervision aspect;\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  aspect on which  the  argument  for\r\n\r\nstatutory power to fix a scale is based.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervision is defined in section 1 of the 1956\r\n\r\nscale and was previously defined in the 1932 scale\r\n\r\nand it is linked with the local authority by-laws:\r\n\r\nNo. 20 in the Rural Board, I think it is No. 41 in\r\n\r\nthe  Municipal by-laws and deriving from a section\r\n\r\nof the Municipal Ordinance. Briefly, the effect of\r\n\r\nthis is that the person who is responsible as  the\r\n\r\narchitect  must certify that the contractors  have\r\n\r\nobserved  the  by-laws during the building  works.\r\n\r\nThe  by-laws are now under revision and I am  told\r\n\r\nthat the revision will strengthen that requirement\r\n\r\nthat  the  certification is given by the architect\r\n\r\nto  the local authority that the local authority's\r\n\r\nrequirements have been complied with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we all agree, Mr Speaker, that it is very\r\n\r\nimportant that buildings should be good  and  made\r\n\r\nof  good  materials. We must  avoid  the  sort  of\r\n\r\ndefects  which caused the Opposition  to  rise  in\r\n\r\nsome  irritation  to  try  and  stop  me  when   I\r\n\r\nenumerated  a lengthy list of defects  during  the\r\n\r\nBudget   debate  last  year.  Such   defects   are\r\n\r\nobviously  undesirable  and  they  do   arise   if\r\n\r\ninsufficient  supervision is  given.  If  we  have\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory buildings going up in Singapore, it\r\n\r\nis  a very bad thing for the final occupiers,  who\r\n\r\nare  saddled with a house which involves a lot  of\r\n\r\nrepairs and expense and worry and which may have a\r\n\r\nmuch  shorter life than they had hoped  when  they\r\n\r\nput  their money into it. Of course, it is also  a\r\n\r\nserious  liability  to  the  country  if  we  have\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  buildings  going   up.   We   have\r\n\r\nprobably   a  considerable  shortage  of   skilled\r\n\r\nmanpower   to   do  building,  some  shortage   of\r\n\r\nmaterials  sometimes  and shortage  of  money  for\r\n\r\nspending  on capital development; and  if  private\r\n\r\ndevelopment  is  of  a  low or  an  unsatisfactory\r\n\r\nstandard,  then  to that degree, scarce  resources\r\n\r\nare  being wastefully used. That would be  a  very\r\n\r\nregrettable thing. If there were collusion between\r\n\r\nthe contractor and the architect, there would be a\r\n\r\ngrave  danger  to the public interest.  An  unholy\r\n\r\nalliance  between  architect  and  contractor,  in\r\n\r\nwhich the architect cuts his fees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  client  but  takes a  rake-off  from  the\r\n\r\ncontractor  in  return for  closing  his  eyes  to\r\n\r\nnefarious omissions by the contractor, is a  thing\r\n\r\nwhich should not be tolerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether by removing this scale of\r\n\r\nfees  we  shall in fact open the way to  collusion\r\n\r\nand   improper  practices  and  thus  weaken   the\r\n\r\nposition  with  regard  to maintenance  of  proper\r\n\r\nbuilding  standards. I do not think that we  shall\r\n\r\nopen  the  way to collusion. I do not  think  that\r\n\r\nremoval  will have any significant effect in  that\r\n\r\ndirection; and I will now give my reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, under the Architects Ordinance, there are\r\n\r\nand always have been engineers who were registered\r\n\r\nas  architects under the Ordinance  and  who  were\r\n\r\nable to function as architects, to sign plans  and\r\n\r\nto certify buildings to the local authorities; but\r\n\r\nthe engineers were not bound by this scale of fees\r\n\r\nwhich  is applicable only to architects. There  is\r\n\r\nan  obvious anomaly in this position. The Board of\r\n\r\nArchitects  has recognised it but they  have  been\r\n\r\nguided  by expert legal advice and they  have  not\r\n\r\nseen  their  way  to alter it; and  I  think  that\r\n\r\nprobably it is the case that the general  code  of\r\n\r\nconduct laid down by the Board under the Ordinance\r\n\r\nappears  not  to apply to engineers  who  register\r\n\r\nunder the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the result of this, Mr Speaker, is that in\r\n\r\nprivate practice in Singapore, there are something\r\n\r\nlike  72  architects  and 38 engineers  registered\r\n\r\nunder the Ordinance; and I am informed that in the\r\n\r\nperiod  of  one year from June 1955 to June  1956,\r\n\r\nthere  were  261 building plans submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council by architects and 123 by engineers - a\r\n\r\nproportion  of about two-thirds by architects  and\r\n\r\none-third by engineers. In a major job such  as  a\r\n\r\nblock of flats, the proportion will be a good deal\r\n\r\nhigher in the hands of the architects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that is the actual extent to which the\r\n\r\nanomaly exists. There are two ways of dealing with\r\n\r\nit. The first is to bring the engineers within the\r\n\r\nscale  and within the code of conduct and to bring\r\n\r\nthem  completely in parity with the architects  in\r\n\r\nso far as they are registered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  architects. That was indeed my first  thought:\r\n\r\nthe  alternative is to take the architect out from\r\n\r\nthe  scale and I have chosen that because  if  the\r\n\r\nscale  were an essential protection in the  public\r\n\r\ninterest and if the scale were really necessary to\r\n\r\nprevent  collusion and cut-throat competition  and\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that proper standards are  maintained,\r\n\r\nthen we simply have to recognise that in fact  the\r\n\r\nscale  has not been operating for a third  of  the\r\n\r\nprofession.  The  engineering  qualification   has\r\n\r\nenabled a very large section of the people who are\r\n\r\nactually  functioning  as architects  to  function\r\n\r\noutside  the  scale. If it was  going  to  produce\r\n\r\ncollusion  or  cut-throat  operations, it   would\r\n\r\nalready  have produced those ill-effects  but  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of Architects of Malaya have  shown  no\r\n\r\nsigns  of being aware that they are threatened  or\r\n\r\nbeing  under-cut by the operations  of  registered\r\n\r\nengineers. The Board of Architects has  not  drawn\r\n\r\nattention  to  it  and said,  \"This  is  producing\r\n\r\ndisastrous results. We must remove this  anomaly.\"\r\n\r\nThe  engineers - the Joint Overseas  Group - have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  worried about it and I am bound  to  presume\r\n\r\nfrom  this  that  the  architects  have  not  felt\r\n\r\nthemselves threatened nor have the leaders of  the\r\n\r\nprofession felt their standards threatened by  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  that  scale  was largely  ineffective.\r\n\r\nThere  appears to have been no fear  in  the  past\r\n\r\nthat  the absence of the scale with regard to one-third of those working as architects had produced,\r\n\r\nwas  producing or would produce any  serious  ill-effects,  any tendency for the architects  or  the\r\n\r\nengineers to yield to temptations to collusive  or\r\n\r\ndishonest practices. It is that which leads me  to\r\n\r\nthink it is a very fair presumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also not wholly satisfied that in all cases\r\n\r\nthe  scale  is  adhered to by  those  to  whom  it\r\n\r\napplies - the registered architects. We  should  not\r\n\r\nhave to go very far to find cases where a firm  of\r\n\r\narchitects undertake a charitable job - a  home  for\r\n\r\none sort or another of charitable organisation - and\r\n\r\nin  one way or another does not in fact charge the\r\n\r\nfull  fee.  That  is very laudable  and  admirable\r\n\r\ngenerosity  on  their  part  but  it  defeats  the\r\n\r\nintention  of the Ordinance. It is a kick-back  to\r\n\r\nthe charitable organisation because they have a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespect for the charitable organisation but it  is\r\n\r\nobviously  a  means of defeating the operation  of\r\n\r\nthe scale fixed by statutory power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also told - I cannot produce evidence needed\r\n\r\nto  convince  a  court of law - that it  does  occur\r\n\r\nsometimes that for an ordinary commercial building\r\n\r\njob, a client makes a deal with his architect  for\r\n\r\na  lump sum payment of fee and this is not in  any\r\n\r\nway  related to the scale of fees but it  is  just\r\n\r\nfixed  to  suit  both parties. In  the  nature  of\r\n\r\nthings,  nobody  can easily tell whether  that  is\r\n\r\nhappening  or  not  and  I  do  not  know  of  any\r\n\r\neffective machinery at present existing  by  which\r\n\r\none  could detect whether it is happening or  not.\r\n\r\nIf  you cannot detect breaches of the scale,  then\r\n\r\nyou  cannot take action to punish breaches of  the\r\n\r\nscale  and the scale is in fact a decoration which\r\n\r\nappears to provide a protection to the public  but\r\n\r\ndoes  not provide it, The protection lies  in  the\r\n\r\nprofessional pride, competence and standards which\r\n\r\nare  maintained  by members of a highly  respected\r\n\r\nprofession.  The scale appears to put  them  under\r\n\r\npenalty  if they fall below their proper standards\r\n\r\nbut  it does not appear to me that the scale would\r\n\r\nbe  enforceable if it was necessary  nor  does  it\r\n\r\nappear  to  me  to  be  necessary.  I  think  very\r\n\r\nstrongly that unnecessary or unenforceable control\r\n\r\nshould  never  be  imposed.  If  they  have   been\r\n\r\nimposed, then they should be removed as quickly as\r\n\r\npossible and that is what I am seeking to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of the removal require a word.\r\n\r\nProfessional organisations will now have  squarely\r\n\r\nin   their   own  hands  the  responsibility   for\r\n\r\nmaintaining   proper  professional  standards   of\r\n\r\nconduct  amongst their members.  I  have  had  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of  discussing this matter  with  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of  Architects, Malaya,  and  with  the\r\n\r\nJoint Overseas Group of Engineers and we also  had\r\n\r\na  certain amount of correspondence extending over\r\n\r\na  year or so. I am aware of their views and  they\r\n\r\nhave  said  that they will consider  whether  they\r\n\r\nought  to initiate any further action in order  to\r\n\r\nensure that codes of conduct and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandards   of  building  are  maintained   at   a\r\n\r\nprofessional  level. I look forward with  interest\r\n\r\nto hearing from the leaders of the profession what\r\n\r\nthey think is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, although I do not think it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  or useful or desirable to  retain  this\r\n\r\nscale  of fees, I do not want to suggest that  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of proper building standards needs  no\r\n\r\nfurther  attention. I think it does  need  further\r\n\r\nattention.    We    are    having    very    rapid\r\n\r\ndevelopment - both private and public development - in\r\n\r\nSingapore today. The economic survey reports  show\r\n\r\nsomewhere  around $100 million worth of investment\r\n\r\nin  construction a year; population is rising; the\r\n\r\nneed  for houses is increasing all the time;  and,\r\n\r\nin short, the building industry is being subjected\r\n\r\nto new strains and stresses which did not exist in\r\n\r\nthe  much more spacious and less overcrowded  days\r\n\r\nwhen  most  of  the legislation  and  by-laws  and\r\n\r\nmachinery of control were designed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government view is that the whole situation\r\n\r\nwith regard to private building standards needs to\r\n\r\nbe  examined and the Government is therefore going\r\n\r\nto   appoint  a  very  competent  officer,   whose\r\n\r\nappointment  is  terminating under Malayanisation,\r\n\r\nto  make  a  full study and to report.  This  will\r\n\r\ninvolve paying him a professional fee and I  shall\r\n\r\nbe  seeking  approval for this  payment  from  the\r\n\r\nHouse  on  another  occasion. I  do  not  wish  to\r\n\r\nprejudge in any way the findings which may  appear\r\n\r\nin  his report, which I hope will be available  in\r\n\r\nabout  two  months - possibly a little  longer,  not\r\n\r\nmore than three months. We shall be quite wrong to\r\n\r\nprejudge  what  may appear in the report  but  the\r\n\r\nintention  is that the report will give a  general\r\n\r\ngathering together of information of all types  on\r\n\r\nwhich it will be possible to judge better how  far\r\n\r\nproper building standards are being maintained and\r\n\r\nwhether  any  action is desirable to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthey  are maintained in the future. It is possible\r\n\r\nthat  in  the general context of the report,  this\r\n\r\nscale  of fees which we are now seeking to  remove\r\n\r\nmay  need  to be considered again. If it was  made\r\n\r\nclear  that the scale of fees was a useful  weapon\r\n\r\nand that it could effectively be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nused,  that machinery could be set up which  would\r\n\r\nmake  it possible to detect breaches of the scale;\r\n\r\nthen  it should certainly be considered again and,\r\n\r\nif  necessary, the weapon should be  sharpened  up\r\n\r\nand  brought  into use. So much, Mr Speaker,  for\r\n\r\nclause 2 (Scale of Fees).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pass on to clause 3. In clause 3 (a), there\r\n\r\nis   a  slight  liberalisation  of  the  means  of\r\n\r\nrecognition for a young man who is qualified as an\r\n\r\narchitect;  for  instead  of  having  to  get  his\r\n\r\nqualification against a prescribed  list,  he  can\r\n\r\nbring  his qualification along and say, \"Will  you\r\n\r\napprove this qualification?\" I do not know if  the\r\n\r\nchanges  are  profoundly significant but  it  does\r\n\r\nliberalise the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are minor punctuation changes and then at\r\n\r\n(d),  we  preserve to a single mechanical engineer\r\n\r\nwho  registered during the last year his  position\r\n\r\nas  a  registered person under the Ordinance.  The\r\n\r\namendment (of which Members have had notice that I\r\n\r\npropose  to  move, on the Order Paper) which  will\r\n\r\nchange \"July, 1956\" to read \"July, 1957\" in  order\r\n\r\nto  preserve to this gentleman a status  which  he\r\n\r\nhas  acquired and which should not be removed from\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides for higher registration fees\r\n\r\nand  renewal  fees from those who register.  Those\r\n\r\nfees  were  made in the past at a  time  when  the\r\n\r\ndollar was worth a great deal more than it is now,\r\n\r\nand  it is appropriate that they should be brought\r\n\r\nup  in line with the income which an architect can\r\n\r\nexpect to earn and with the costs which the  Board\r\n\r\nmay  have  to  incur, for example, in  payment  of\r\n\r\nlegal expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 removes certain classes of engineering\r\n\r\nqualifications. I do not want to go into  them  in\r\n\r\ndetail but I can do so if the House desires. But I\r\n\r\nmust  briefly  point  out that  this  is  only  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to those who wish to practise in  effect\r\n\r\nas  architects.  The removal of the qualifications\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean  that a man cannot practise  as  a\r\n\r\nmunicipal engineer or an electrical engineer or  a\r\n\r\nsurveyor, it only means that he cannot sign plans,\r\n\r\nand  so  on, in relation to the Ordinance and  the\r\n\r\nlocal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nauthority requirements. I think in the past it was\r\n\r\nprobably a sound thing that wherever anybody could\r\n\r\nbe  held  to  be qualified, he should have  had  a\r\n\r\nchance  to  come  in  and help  in  building  work\r\n\r\nbecause there was a shortage of qualified men; but\r\n\r\nI  do not think that that shortage exists now.  It\r\n\r\ncertainly,  I think, will not exist in the  future\r\n\r\nwith  the large number of students of architecture\r\n\r\nand civil engineering who are at present overseas\r\n\r\nand  who  will  be returning here in  due  course.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to fear a shortage and I do not\r\n\r\nthink  that our young men or women when they  come\r\n\r\nback from a taxing, difficult and expensive course\r\n\r\noverseas should be exposed to possible competition\r\n\r\nfrom, say, a surveyor who has abandoned his proper\r\n\r\nwork  of  surveying and, having registered  as  an\r\n\r\narchitect,  wishes  in  fact  to  practise  as  an\r\n\r\narchitect  for  which  he  has  not  really   been\r\n\r\ntrained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point in connection with this, it\r\n\r\nsometimes  happens to an electrical or  mechanical\r\n\r\nengineer  that in designing a factory  layout,  he\r\n\r\nfinds it necessary to suggest that some additional\r\n\r\nbuilding - say   a   pump-house   or   an    engine-house - should be added to the building; or he needs\r\n\r\nto  design a concrete floor on which an engine has\r\n\r\nto stand; and it is a very convenient and sensible\r\n\r\nthing   that   he   should  be  able,   in   those\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  to  put his  plans  to  the  local\r\n\r\nauthority to get them approved and not to have to\r\n\r\nrun  around and waste his time and everyone else's\r\n\r\ngetting  an architect to put his chop on  them.  I\r\n\r\nshould   not  wish  to  stop  the  mechanical   or\r\n\r\nelectrical  engineer from doing that  as  long  as\r\n\r\nthat was all he was doing. I have put the point to\r\n\r\nthe Joint Overseas Group and they are studying it.\r\n\r\nI hope they will suggest a reasonable solution but\r\n\r\na  reasonable solution must, to my mind, be in the\r\n\r\nterms  that the mechanical or electrical  engineer\r\n\r\nis   not  able  to  abandon  his  proper  work  of\r\n\r\nmechanical or electrical engineering and  take  up\r\n\r\nsigning plans for building estates. If we can  get\r\n\r\na  workable solution suggested, we can have a look\r\n\r\nat  it  and  see  if we should make  some  further\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of clause 5 opens the door to a\r\n\r\nvery  valued class of students - those  who  are  at\r\n\r\npresent  in  Australia taking various  engineering\r\n\r\nqualifications which are sufficiently indicated in\r\n\r\nthe  Explanatory  Note. Hitherto,  on  qualifying,\r\n\r\nthey  have  of course been able to come  back  and\r\n\r\npractise as engineers but they have not been  able\r\n\r\nto  register  under the Ordinance. This  will  now\r\n\r\nenable  them to register. To put it in very simple\r\n\r\nlanguage,  we heartily welcome our young  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  taking professional qualifications  and  we\r\n\r\nare delighted to have them come back again to lend\r\n\r\na hand in Singapore's much needed development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, those are very briefly the main points which I think I have dealt with in regard\r\n\r\nto  this  Bill. There are of course a  great  many\r\n\r\nother  points  which  are more  or  less  remotely\r\n\r\nconnected  and if any Member wishes to  have  them\r\n\r\ndealt  with, I will be delighted to do the best  I\r\n\r\ncan  with  them; but I do not think that  we  need\r\n\r\ntake up the time of the House any further until we\r\n\r\nknow what hon. Members have in their minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.00 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise  to support this Bill  for  slightly\r\n\r\ndifferent  reasons  from  those  that  have   been\r\n\r\nexpounded to us by the Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nand Works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief reason, in a short analysis, he has\r\n\r\ngiven  to  us for his wanting to withdraw  support\r\n\r\nfor  the scale of fees is roughly that this  scale\r\n\r\nhas  been more honoured by its breach than by  its\r\n\r\nobservance,  because  firstly,  one-third  of  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of practising architects are not bound  to\r\n\r\nobserve  the scale and secondly, he has  heard  of\r\n\r\ncases where the members who are bound by the scale\r\n\r\ndo  not  observe it. To my knowledge, Sir, I  also\r\n\r\nagree with the second observation that in cases of\r\n\r\nvery  large  contracts, by some way or other  this\r\n\r\nrule  has  not  been  observed by  the  architects\r\n\r\nthemselves and therefore for this House to support\r\n\r\na rule\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat is not fully observed is wrong and to my mind\r\n\r\nunworkable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I come into this picture for a very\r\n\r\ndifferent  reason. This scale of  fees  was  fixed\r\n\r\nabout  30  years ago. No doubt, at that time,  the\r\n\r\nscale  was 7\u00bd per cent minimum and you could  go\r\n\r\nup  sky-high. The only concession that we had been\r\n\r\nable  to  obtain through last year's  negotiations\r\n\r\nwith  the Institute of Architects was the  waiving\r\n\r\nof  any  fee  above 7\u00bd per cent. It  may  appear\r\n\r\ngenerous to the architects but, in practice, there\r\n\r\nis no generosity at all because since the scale of\r\n\r\nfees has been fixed, the cost of building has gone\r\n\r\nup  at  least four times. Therefore the  scale  if\r\n\r\napplied pre-war would be operating round about  30\r\n\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. When this scale was\r\n\r\nfixed,  no  one  visualised building  projects  of\r\n\r\nbuilding   estates,  public  buildings  and   even\r\n\r\nprivate buildings running into millions of dollars\r\n\r\nand  when  you come to apply the minimum scale  of\r\n\r\n7\u00bd per cent to a project which runs into from $5\r\n\r\nmillion to $10 million, then we get a shock  as  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  we  all  did when I queried  during  the\r\n\r\nBudget sittings last year the allocation of half a\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars for the Polytechnic. When applied\r\n\r\nto this project of $5 million, not only have we to\r\n\r\nprovide  7\u00bd  per cent minimum fee but  there  is\r\n\r\nalso  another 2 per cent for quantity  survey  and\r\n\r\nanother  33 1/3 per cent on the value of reinforced\r\n\r\nconcrete  work which all added together makes  ten\r\n\r\nper cent. So ten per cent of $5 million is half  a\r\n\r\nmillion dollars and I for one feel that the public\r\n\r\ncannot  be asked to pay such sums which in several\r\n\r\ncases  have led to professional men being able  to\r\n\r\nretire after three or four years' practice. We  do\r\n\r\nwelcome  people being well remunerated  for  their\r\n\r\nwork  but  I  do  not  think that  the  public  of\r\n\r\nSingapore will support any scale which will enable\r\n\r\nanyone  to retire at public expense, and I say  so\r\n\r\nbecause I can visualise in the future that  we  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and in Malaya will have to depend  more\r\n\r\nand  more  on private architects than on  our  own\r\n\r\npublic servants as the amount of work that has  to\r\n\r\nbe  done  is  really tremendous. We simply  cannot\r\n\r\nrecruit  enough men to be able to carry  out  that\r\n\r\nwork. As it is, we can see the slowing down of the\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust. Last year, we built  1,000\r\n\r\nunits  instead of 4,000 units. This year,  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  same  thing  will follow and even  our  Public\r\n\r\nWorks Department has not been able to catch up with\r\n\r\nall the projects it has in hand. The only thing  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  do  now  is  to go  out  to  the  private\r\n\r\narchitect and ask him to do the work for  us.  When\r\n\r\nwe  do that, what happens to us? Yes, the scale  is\r\n\r\n7\u00bd per cent minimum. Whereas private persons have\r\n\r\nbeen  able to make the architects depart from  this\r\n\r\nscale,  the Government will have to pay that  scale\r\n\r\nbecause this Assembly last June approved it. I must\r\n\r\nsay  that I was away at that time on leave. Are  we\r\n\r\ngoing to support this rule? No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this: what I am very much\r\n\r\nagainst  the  scale is the minimum  five  per  cent\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  fee. I will just cite one  instance;  I\r\n\r\nknow of several where a grave injustice was caused.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine bought a house and he wanted it to\r\n\r\nbe  renovated. So he went to an architect and asked\r\n\r\nhim to produce plans to enlarge the house. When the\r\n\r\nplans  were  submitted to him, he found  that  they\r\n\r\nwere very poor plans and he did not like them.  The\r\n\r\nestimated cost of renovation ran into $80,000. Then\r\n\r\nhe  said, \"No, no. Let us just forget about it.\" He\r\n\r\nforgot  about it but he received a bill for  $4,000\r\n\r\nand  that  was a bill based on a scale on which  he\r\n\r\nhad to pay. If he went to court, he would have lost\r\n\r\nthe  case. There are other instances but they  will\r\n\r\ntake  too long a time. Therefore I and my Party  do\r\n\r\nsupport  the  amendment to section 2 by withdrawing\r\n\r\nour support altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to clause 5 of the Bill. The\r\n\r\nExplanatory  Note says that certain  qualifications\r\n\r\nobtained   in  Australia  are  now  going   to   be\r\n\r\nrecognised  here to enable Malayans who hold  these\r\n\r\ndegrees to practise. That, Sir, I think, is a  very\r\n\r\ngood  move,  it has been very long overdue  but  it\r\n\r\ndoes not go far enough. I am now speaking for those\r\n\r\nof  our  Malayans  who  are holding  qualifications\r\n\r\nobtained  in  foreign institutions,  qualifications\r\n\r\nwhich in New York, Shanghai and Hong Kong have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the building of huge  skyscrapers,\r\n\r\nten  times what we have in Singapore, and  yet  not\r\n\r\none of them has been allowed to be registered as an\r\n\r\narchitect.  I have seriously considered  moving  an\r\n\r\namendment  to  the  Bill but on going  through  the\r\n\r\nArchitects Ordinance, I find that under section  6,\r\n\r\nthere  is provision for the Board of Architects  to\r\n\r\nregister  any  person who shall satisfy  the  Board\r\n\r\nthat  he  is fully qualified for having received  a\r\n\r\nproper and recognised training in the profession of\r\n\r\narchitecture.  To us who are not  members  of  this\r\n\r\nprofession,  we wonder why it is that  not  one  of\r\n\r\nthese people is good enough. I refer to the ones  I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned  as  being  able  to  put  up  skyscrapers, a hundred storeys high. Particularly more\r\n\r\nso  when  I know that at least the applications  of\r\n\r\nten  people who have been qualified either  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States of America or Hong Kong have applied\r\n\r\nfor  registration (some of them applied as long  as\r\n\r\ntwo  years ago) are still being considered. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge the Institute of Architects to consider\r\n\r\nvery rapidly the question of admitting these people\r\n\r\nto  practise,  otherwise, rightly or  wrongly,  the\r\n\r\npublic  will form the impression that this honoured\r\n\r\nbody  of  professional men is unwilling to move  or\r\n\r\nchange  with  the times as has happened  over  this\r\n\r\nquestion of minimum fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Sir, I agree with the hon. Minister\r\n\r\nwhen he said that we have to be careful to see that\r\n\r\nour  buildings are not shoddily built and I for one\r\n\r\nam  prepared to support any realistic scale with  a\r\n\r\nreducing  minimum  after  the  first  $100,000   or\r\n\r\n$200,000 when it is presented to us, because  I  do\r\n\r\nfeel   that  an  honourable  profession   like   an\r\n\r\narchitect's profession should not be subject to cut-throat rates; but let us have a realistic scale and\r\n\r\nnot  one  under  which a man can  retire  in  three\r\n\r\nyears' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.10 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  as  I am the only architect in this House,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  I  have to say something on this Bill  or  at\r\n\r\nleast to express my personal opinion on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is such a law in any part of the world as regards the question of minimum fees, that is, clause 4 of the Bill. I have made enquiries from the Federation, Hongkong and other parts of the world. I have found no evidence that\r\n\r\nthey  have such a law in those countries. In fact,\r\n\r\na  Minister  in the Federation told  me  that  the\r\n\r\nBoard  of Architects in the Federation have  tried\r\n\r\nto  introduce that clause for the last five  years\r\n\r\nand  that  every  time it went  to  the  Executive\r\n\r\nCouncil, it was thrown out. Although such a law is\r\n\r\nnot in existence in the Federation or in Hongkong,\r\n\r\nI believe that they have less badly constructed or\r\n\r\ntilted buildings than we have in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance, I believe, was introduced in 1926\r\n\r\nby  a  number  of  people, mostly  qualified  from\r\n\r\nabroad.  They  must have come together  and  said,\r\n\r\n\"Since  we are only a few here, why do we not  try\r\n\r\nto  extort  as much as possible from the  public?\"\r\n\r\nThat  was their view then and I think that is  the\r\n\r\nview  that is being adopted now. When this  matter\r\n\r\nwas  discussed  in  the Institute  of  Architects,\r\n\r\nMalaya, one of its members said, \"Why should we go\r\n\r\nhome  empty-handed? Why cannot we make  hay  while\r\n\r\nthe  sun  shines?\" That is the attitude  they  are\r\n\r\nadopting.  Those  so-called big firms  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  advocating  that  they  should  retain   the\r\n\r\nminimum  charge  knowing very well  that  the  big\r\n\r\nprojects of Government will go to them because the\r\n\r\nadvisers  are their friends. The fee  of  $800,000\r\n\r\nfor  the Polytechnic is equal to 20 years'  salary\r\n\r\nof  the  Chief Minister. Is that not a shame  that\r\n\r\nthis kind of robbery is allowed to go on?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Hear, hear.\r\n\r\nDown with the white man!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> I do not say that. That is the\r\n\r\nway  they are doing it. With Malayanisation around\r\n\r\nthe  corner, I think there will be a lot  of  jobs\r\n\r\nwhich  Government  has  to  give  to  the  private\r\n\r\narchitects, and if this minimum scale of  fees  is\r\n\r\nnot   removed,  every  firm  will  come   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  say, \"Even if I  wish  to  charge\r\n\r\nless, I will not be allowed to do that. You do not\r\n\r\nwant me to commit an offence, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is - as has been pointed out by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Paya Lebar - that, as the present law\r\n\r\nstands,  whether a building costs $20,000  or  $20\r\n\r\nmillion,  the  minimum fee is the same-  7\u00bd  per\r\n\r\ncent.  Whether it is a warehouse or a cinema,  the\r\n\r\nfee  is  the same although the former takes  about\r\n\r\nless  than  half  of  the work  required  for  the\r\n\r\nlatter. Is this fair?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is no such protection in any other\r\n\r\nprofession,  why should architects want  it?  They\r\n\r\nwant  such protection because they know very  well\r\n\r\nthat without it they will not have a chance to rob\r\n\r\nthe  public as much as they would like. If  a  man\r\n\r\nwants  to  charge  less for his  work  why  should\r\n\r\nGovernment  forbid him from doing so? Suppose  the\r\n\r\nonly  way  an  architect can earn a living  is  to\r\n\r\ncharge  less,  do  you  think  it  is  right  that\r\n\r\nGovernment  should prevent him from  doing  so  to\r\n\r\nearn  a living? I think it is rubbish to say  that\r\n\r\nending  the power to fix fees will result  in  bad\r\n\r\nbuildings  being erected. I do not see any  reason\r\n\r\nfor  an architect to say that the removal of  this\r\n\r\nclause  will  result in a lot of corruption:  that\r\n\r\ndepends on the man himself. If that is the line of\r\n\r\nargument, I think we should raise the salaries  of\r\n\r\nall Government officers by three or four times  to\r\n\r\nprevent corruption, but I do not think that is the\r\n\r\nway to prevent it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second part, that is section 5, on the\r\n\r\nqualifications  acceptable  for  registration,   I\r\n\r\nthink  in  the  past  we  have  placed  too   much\r\n\r\nconfidence on people having British qualifications\r\n\r\nand  that it has been the practice not to register\r\n\r\nanyone with qualifications obtained from somewhere\r\n\r\nelse.  I can understand the attitude adopted then.\r\n\r\nNothing  could  be  done but with  self-government\r\n\r\naround the corner I think we should reconsider the\r\n\r\nwhole   case.   What  is  wrong  with  registering\r\n\r\narchitects from China, Indonesia or Japan, or even\r\n\r\nfrom  Communist Russia? If they are good  and  can\r\n\r\nrender  a  service to this country, why should  we\r\n\r\nnot admit them? Why should we limit qualifications\r\n\r\nto  those obtained in England alone? Does it  mean\r\n\r\nonly the architect qualified in England can design\r\n\r\nbuildings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs   the  Member  for  Paya  Lebar   said,\r\n\r\narchitects  in  the  United  States  design   even\r\n\r\nskyscrapers  and  all  sorts  of  other  types  of\r\n\r\nbuildings, so why should not men trained there  be\r\n\r\nallowed to practise here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to continue to be dictated to by the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of Architects of Malaya,  I  think  the\r\n\r\npublic will be fleeced to the utmost. So I suggest\r\n\r\nthat  if  the  Minister is going to  institute  an\r\n\r\nenquiry  into qualifications acceptable under  the\r\n\r\nArchitects Ordinance, I suggest the members of the\r\n\r\ncommittee should be those who have the interest of\r\n\r\nthis country at heart, not those who intend to  go\r\n\r\naway at the first opportunity because then such an\r\n\r\nenquiry will serve no purpose at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.19 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am  glad that the racket  of  giving  big\r\n\r\nbusiness  big opportunities to make big  money  is\r\n\r\ncoming to a close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

The Labour Front has given  the  big\r\n\r\n$5,000,000  Polytechnic  building  project  to  an\r\n\r\nexpatriate  firm - thanks to the Labour  Front!  The\r\n\r\namount  of  architects'  fees  involved  in   that\r\n\r\ncontract is only half a million dollars!  We  have\r\n\r\nto thank the Labour Front for this!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us come back to this question. I am glad\r\n\r\nthe  racket is off. Whenever firms want  to  erect\r\n\r\nbuildings  for  the  Government,  they   send   in\r\n\r\ntenders,  and  everybody will try to  put  up  the\r\n\r\nlowest. And of course the officers deciding on the\r\n\r\ntenders with the provision of the minimum of  7\u00bd\r\n\r\nper cent, will have no choice but to say, \"We will\r\n\r\nhave  to  fall back on these expatriate  companies\r\n\r\nbecause they are big firms.\" With the removal of a\r\n\r\nminimum  fee, I think the profession  will  become\r\n\r\nmore  competitive. It will enable  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to save a great deal more because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirms which are not very big will be content  with\r\n\r\na  reasonable profit and therefore tender at lower\r\n\r\nfigures. This is good for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, whatever this Assembly wants to\r\n\r\ndo, it has always one motive in mind, and that is:\r\n\r\nWhat  good  will it do to the ordinary  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore?  I  am  thinking,  Sir,  not   of   big\r\n\r\nbuildings   constructed   by   big   business   or\r\n\r\nmillionaires, but of houses for the small man  who\r\n\r\nearns  a few hundred dollars a month and who wants\r\n\r\nto  build his own house. I know in many countries,\r\n\r\nfor  example, New Zealand, Australia and  England,\r\n\r\nwhere  the Government has drawn up a great variety\r\n\r\nof  housing plans any person can obtain such plans\r\n\r\nat  only a very small fee. In Singapore we do  not\r\n\r\nhave these. The best the Government can offer  are\r\n\r\na  few  plans for attap houses, many of  them  not\r\n\r\npopular  with the people here. The Government  has\r\n\r\nno  plans for concrete houses. It is high time  it\r\n\r\nhelps  the people construct such houses by drawing\r\n\r\nstandard  plans and make these available at  small\r\n\r\ncost. The small man who wants to construct his own\r\n\r\nhouse  can  buy and use such a standard  plan  and\r\n\r\nwill  need  only  a  little  supervision  from  an\r\n\r\narchitect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be a very good way of helping the\r\n\r\npeople  save money and making full use of our  few\r\n\r\narchitects. If such plans are drawn up and anybody\r\n\r\ncan go and select one and build his own house, the\r\n\r\narchitects will also then be asked to work on  new\r\n\r\nmodels,  not  old models changed here  and  there.\r\n\r\nThat  will  mean architects do not  do  repetitive\r\n\r\nwork, and can concentrate their efforts to put  up\r\n\r\nnew designs for houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 5, Sir, I agree fully with my\r\n\r\ncolleague   when   he  asked  that   degrees   and\r\n\r\nqualifications  from  countries  other  than   the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom  which  are appropriate  and  good\r\n\r\nshould  be  recognised. We have come  to  a  stage\r\n\r\nwhere  we  must  make use of every  available  and\r\n\r\nqualified  Singaporean to help contribute  to  the\r\n\r\nprogress  of the country. If Malayans  spend  many\r\n\r\nyears in a foreign land like the United States and\r\n\r\ncome  back  with  a  qualification  which  is  not\r\n\r\nrecognised by us but which is accepted in many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother countries, we will be denying ourselves of  a\r\n\r\nsource of valuable talent.

It is not enough just to let in a few  more\r\n\r\narchitects  who  have  been trained  in  Australia,\r\n\r\nCanada,  India, Hongkong or Indonesia. The rate  at\r\n\r\nwhich  housing development should take place if  we\r\n\r\nare  to cope with our population, both the existing\r\n\r\nslum population and the growth in total number,  is\r\n\r\nsuch  that  the  Minister had better  give  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration  to starting an architectural  school\r\n\r\nproducing   hundreds   and   even   thousands    of\r\n\r\narchitects.

There are just one or two little  points  I\r\n\r\nwould like to deal with in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hon. Member of the Opposition referred to the\r\n\r\ncost  to  Government  in paying private  architects\r\n\r\naccording to this scale. This was mentioned in  the\r\n\r\ndebate on the budget last year and of course I took\r\n\r\nnote  of it; but I must emphatically say that  this\r\n\r\nhas  not been the guiding factor which has led  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to move this particular amending clause.\r\n\r\nThe  factor which has been and is in my mind is the\r\n\r\none   which  the  hon.  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nreferred to, firstly, the need for an expansion  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  capacity -  very many  more  buildings - and\r\n\r\nsecondly, very much better buildings at lower cost.\r\n\r\nThat of course means the building industry must  be\r\n\r\nfully efficient and economic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the basis on which my mind has been\r\n\r\nworking, and is the broad problem. A particular job\r\n\r\nwill  need to be done to that end - a survey of  the\r\n\r\nstandards  of  private  building  as  they  are  at\r\n\r\npresent. That is what I propose - I mentioned  it  in\r\n\r\nmy  speech. And when the officer has been appointed\r\n\r\nand  has finished his work we shall be able to  see\r\n\r\nsome  of the problems involved in creating a  fully\r\n\r\nefficient and economic building industry which will\r\n\r\nreally  serve the needs of the people. This  little\r\n\r\nclause on the scale of fees is put in just to do  a\r\n\r\nlittle  tidying up, to put straight what obviously\r\n\r\nis wrong and must be put right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had several references to the\r\n\r\ndesirability  of liberalising our attitude  towards\r\n\r\nthe recognition of qualifications. This is a matter\r\n\r\nwhich very easily engenders a great deal more  heat\r\n\r\nthan  light. We will find that anybody  who  has  a\r\n\r\nqualification, however low it may be,  will  desire\r\n\r\nit to be given the fullest recognition; but as soon\r\n\r\nas  that  is  done he says. \"Now I  am  registered,\r\n\r\nrecognised\", and he will be able to get  his  hands\r\n\r\nwell into the money-making aspect of his work.  The\r\n\r\nstatement that all people who have qualified in any\r\n\r\nway and who then come to Singapore do so solely  to\r\n\r\nserve the country with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno thought of self at all is, I am afraid, not one\r\n\r\nwhich  is  likely  to be borne  out  by  practical\r\n\r\nexperience.  Indeed  the  hon.  Member  for  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang  indicated that some people who  have  the\r\n\r\nqualifications were in his opinion making  a  very\r\n\r\ngood  thing out of them; so to get people  without\r\n\r\nsuitable qualifications and give them a chance  of\r\n\r\nmaking  a  good thing out of the building industry\r\n\r\nwould probably be disastrous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Point of order, Sir. I did not\r\n\r\nindicate   in  my  speech  that  a   man   of   no\r\n\r\nqualification should be registered. I merely  said\r\n\r\nthat  we  should not limit registration to British\r\n\r\nqualifications only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a point for explanation, not\r\n\r\na point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I was talking without notes\r\n\r\nand  I think I expressed myself wrongly. I did not\r\n\r\nintend  to  imply that the hon. Member  wished  to\r\n\r\ngive    people    registration   who    have    no\r\n\r\nqualification,  but that there is  a  tendency  to\r\n\r\nlower  qualifications. On that point  I  have  two\r\n\r\nimportant points to make both connected  with  our\r\n\r\nown  local  young men and women who are qualifying\r\n\r\nthemselves.  The  first  is  that  we  have  every\r\n\r\nprospect  of  a  sufficient  intake  of  qualified\r\n\r\npeople  in the architectural and civil engineering\r\n\r\nprofessions  in the next few years. I  have  asked\r\n\r\nfor,  though  I  have  not  yet  got,  the  latest\r\n\r\nfigures; but in general a year or two ago we had a\r\n\r\ntotal  of 48 Government and 53 private engineering\r\n\r\nand  technical  students  in  the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nalone,  in Australia 23 Government and 45  private\r\n\r\nstudents  and  in  the United  States  13  private\r\n\r\nstudents, which gives you a total of 182 - a  fairly\r\n\r\nhandsome  intake if they come in during  the  next\r\n\r\nthree  or four years. We shall then have an  ample\r\n\r\nsupply  of  young  people who are qualified.  They\r\n\r\nwill  not  have the experience to do the big  jobs\r\n\r\nbut  they will have the qualifications. So  if  we\r\n\r\nstart   to  recognise  many  other  degrees,   the\r\n\r\nprospects  for these young men and women  will  be\r\n\r\nmarkedly decreased. They may find themselves in  a\r\n\r\nflooded market. They do need a reasonable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasure    of   protection   to   get   themselves\r\n\r\nestablished and get into industry. If  things  are\r\n\r\ntoo  hard for them they may get a most unfortunate\r\n\r\nimpression. I am thinking in terms of a profession\r\n\r\nas a function of industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of course is that we are\r\n\r\ndeveloping technical education here. In the nature\r\n\r\nof  things you cannot set up a complete system  of\r\n\r\ntechnical  education by waving hands in  the  air.\r\n\r\nYou  have  to acquire the staff and the buildings,\r\n\r\nand  then the students have to go through  a  long\r\n\r\ncourse of work. But when we do have our own  local\r\n\r\nqualifications  we shall no doubt hope  that  they\r\n\r\nwill   be   acceptable,  recognisable,  in   other\r\n\r\nterritories, as our medical qualifications have in\r\n\r\nfact   been  so  long  recognised.  If  we  accord\r\n\r\nrecognition to all comers now, we shall  have  no\r\n\r\nbargaining power when in future we seek reciprocal\r\n\r\nrecognition for our own qualifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An aspect of this question is that I personally\r\n\r\nhope that this territory will become a centre  for\r\n\r\neducation   not   only  for  Singapore   and   the\r\n\r\nFederation, but also for other territories  around\r\n\r\nus.  It  may very well be that in future we  shall\r\n\r\nhave  the  capacity  to train a  large  number  of\r\n\r\nstudents  from  Vietnam,  Thailand.  Indonesia  or\r\n\r\nelsewhere who will welcome the opportunity to come\r\n\r\nhere  rather  than go to Australia or  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom. And there will be an added attraction  if\r\n\r\nthey  know that the qualifications they  get  here\r\n\r\nare widely recognisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States has been mentioned. I do not\r\n\r\nknow  if I should place the U.S. high on the scale\r\n\r\nof  strictness  in recognition but I  am  informed\r\n\r\nthat  there,  a  man  who may  build  a  beautiful\r\n\r\nskyscraper in New York may be unable to build  one\r\n\r\nin  San  Francisco because even between the States\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  mutual recognition of each  other's\r\n\r\nqualifications. So I feel that until we have  gone\r\n\r\na  bit further into that it will be unwise to  say\r\n\r\nthat  any  American qualification can be accepted.\r\n\r\nNo doubt they may be very valuable ones but they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  be  scrutinised in relation to syllabus,  the\r\n\r\nactual  work done, the period taken and the quality\r\n\r\nof subsequent training. The Board of Architects has\r\n\r\nalready  referred this matter to the  Institute  of\r\n\r\nArchitects  of  Malaya  which  is  not   a   wholly\r\n\r\nexpatriate  body  but  has  highly  competent   and\r\n\r\nexperienced local men on it. We shall no  doubt  go\r\n\r\nforward gradually in this but it is not a matter on\r\n\r\nwhich we should rush ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not foresee any immediate shortage of newly\r\n\r\nqualified men for Singapore. The shortage  will  be\r\n\r\nof   men   with  ten,  twelve  or  fifteen   years'\r\n\r\nexperience who are competent to direct the work  of\r\n\r\nthe newly qualified men, and that shortage will not\r\n\r\nbe affected significantly by the proposal which has\r\n\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill [Mr Francis Thomas].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.42 a.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 and 2 ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 11, to leave out \"June, 1956\"\r\n\r\nand insert \"July, 1957\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already given an explanation of the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  this amendment in my  speech  but  the\r\n\r\neffect  of  it  is  to permit a  registration  made\r\n\r\nbetween  the  date  when  we  first  proposed   the\r\n\r\namendment and the present date to remain valid.

This  proposal  is  made  at  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion of the Director of Audit on the  grounds\r\n\r\nthat it is established financial practice that  all\r\n\r\ntransactions, including loans, which  diminish  the\r\n\r\ncolony's free surplus of revenue should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecorded  as  expenditure at the time  payment  is\r\n\r\nmade.  In  Singapore, the practice of  showing  as\r\n\r\nassets  long-term loans, which in the case of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Improvement  Trust  are  repaid   over\r\n\r\nperiods of up to 60 years, has sprung up since the\r\n\r\nwar. The position has now been reached where these\r\n\r\nassets,  which are in no sense of the term liquid,\r\n\r\ntotal  about $126 million and, by being  shown  as\r\n\r\nassets in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities,\r\n\r\npaint   an  entirely  erroneous  picture  of   the\r\n\r\nstrength  and liquidity of the colony's  finances.\r\n\r\nIt  has  therefore been decided to  agree  to  the\r\n\r\nDirector of Audit's suggestion and to charge these\r\n\r\nlong-term loans to expenditure. This will be  done\r\n\r\nby  resolution  of the Assembly  as  soon  as  the\r\n\r\naccounts  for 1956 have been closed and the  exact\r\n\r\ntotals involved are known. It will be appreciated,\r\n\r\nof  course, that this is purely a matter of  book-keeping.  No  additional expenditure is  involved.\r\n\r\nThe  result will be that the Statement  of  Assets\r\n\r\nand  Liabilities  will give a much  more  accurate\r\n\r\nidea of the strength and liquidity of the colony's\r\n\r\nfinancial  position.  A Statement  of  Assets  and\r\n\r\nLiabilities drawn up on this basis is, as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid, shown on page 8 of the Estimates.\" [Vol.  2,\r\n\r\nNo. 9, Col. 600-1.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this proposal met with the approval of hon.\r\n\r\nMembers. The only comment came from an hon. Member\r\n\r\nwho  suggested that a footnote should be added  to\r\n\r\nthe  Statement of Assets and Liabilities appearing\r\n\r\nin  page  8 of the Annual Estimates to the  effect\r\n\r\nthat  these long-term loans, previously  shown  as\r\n\r\nassets,  were now detailed in an appendix  to  the\r\n\r\nEstimates.  Hon. Members will see  that  this  has\r\n\r\nsince been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think, Sir, that I need give any\r\n\r\nfurther  explanation  to  that  which  I  gave  in\r\n\r\nNovember last and which I have now repeated. There\r\n\r\nis only one point which I should mention. When the\r\n\r\ndraft  Estimates were drawn up in August 1956,  it\r\n\r\nwas  thought  that  these  long-term  loans  would\r\n\r\namount  to  about $126,000,000 by the end  of  the\r\n\r\nyear,  and  I mentioned this when I spoke  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.   In   point  of  fact,  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust  drew  about  $7,000,00()  less\r\n\r\nunder Loan Programme No. 6 during the remainder of\r\n\r\nthe   year;   and  the  City  Council  drew   only\r\n\r\n$3,000,000  instead  of $4,000,000  in  connection\r\n\r\nwith the loan for the Kallang Bridge roadway.  The\r\n\r\ntotal  to  be  charged  to  expenditure  on   31st\r\n\r\nDecember, 1956, was therefore only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$118,658,977.84 as shown in the motion.

Members will have observed  from  the\r\n\r\nReport  that  only  a few written  representations\r\n\r\nwere  submitted  and that no oral  representations\r\n\r\nwere  made. Members will wish me to draw attention\r\n\r\nto  the  main  amendments to the  Bill  in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee and this I will proceed to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning clause 5, a new paragraph (c) has\r\n\r\nbeen  included  to enable citizens of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  or  Colonies,  or  persons  born  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya, Sarawak, North  Borneo  or\r\n\r\nBrunei  to  vote  after one year's residence.  The\r\n\r\nreason  for  this  is  that  while  the  Bill  has\r\n\r\nextended the right to vote to alien nationals with\r\n\r\nfive  years'  residence,  adult  persons  who  are\r\n\r\ncitizens of the United Kingdom or who were born in\r\n\r\nMalaya, etc., were barred from voting because they\r\n\r\nhave less than five years' residence in Singapore.\r\n\r\nNevertheless  those  same persons  with  only  one\r\n\r\nyear's  residence  can  vote  in  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly elections. By this amendment they can now\r\n\r\nalso  vote in the local government elections after\r\n\r\none year's residence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the machinery for elections,\r\n\r\namendments  have  been made to clause  9  to  meet\r\n\r\nrepresentations  which have been  made  advocating\r\n\r\nimprovements to polling arrangements.  Sub-clauses\r\n\r\n(3), (4) and (5) give discretionary powers to  the\r\n\r\nReturning Officer regarding the number and kind of\r\n\r\npolling stations, and for guidance in the exercise\r\n\r\nof  his  discretion the provision of  one  polling\r\n\r\nstation   for   every  2,000   voters   has   been\r\n\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main amendment to clause 10 is a little\r\n\r\ntechnical.  Briefly, the purpose of the  new  sub-clause (1), being a telescoped version of old sub-clauses  (1),  (2),  (3) and  (4),  is  to  enable\r\n\r\narrangements  to be made for preparing  the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Electoral Rolls corrected  up  to  1st\r\n\r\nApril,  1957,  instead  of  1st  April,  1956.  In\r\n\r\nanticipation  of  the  City Council  elections  in\r\n\r\nDecember,  electoral  rolls corrected  up  to  1st\r\n\r\nApril, 1957, are now under preparation. Claims and\r\n\r\nobjections  will  of course follow  the  procedure\r\n\r\ngiven in clause 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now, Sir, to clause 66, the purpose of\r\n\r\nthe provision which has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadded to paragraph (a) of sub-clause (1) is to make\r\n\r\nit clear that either payment for or contract to pay\r\n\r\nfor  any petroleum used for vehicles which  may  be\r\n\r\nlawfully used for the conveyance of electors to and\r\n\r\nfrom  the  polling booths is not constituted  as  a\r\n\r\nlegal  practice.  It expressly provides  that  such\r\n\r\npayments  shall be regarded as expenses within  the\r\n\r\nmeaning  of  clause  65  which  limits  the   total\r\n\r\nexpenses which may be incurred by candidates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the amendments which I have already\r\n\r\ndescribed, Members are aware that I have  a  number\r\n\r\nof  further  amendments to make  as  given  in  the\r\n\r\nNotice   of   Amendments.  These  are   all   minor\r\n\r\namendments except those to clauses 22 and  34.  The\r\n\r\npurpose of the amendment to clause 22 is to rectify\r\n\r\nan omission by making express provision for filling\r\n\r\na  casual vacancy within two months. Concerning the\r\n\r\namendment  to clause 34 this simply is designed  to\r\n\r\nensure that the date on which the poll is taken  is\r\n\r\nnot  less than 16 days from the date of the  notice\r\n\r\nof election.

Now  Sir,  this morning  in  answer  to  a\r\n\r\nquestion by the Member for Serangoon [Mr Lim Choon\r\n\r\nMong]  as  to  whether an All-Party  Committee  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  set up to consider the all-important\r\n\r\nquestion of these electoral divisions in the  local\r\n\r\ngovernment  areas, we heard the answer was  in  the\r\n\r\nnegative   except  possibly  that  these  electoral\r\n\r\ndivisions which have already been worked  out  will\r\n\r\nbe  referred or have been referred in the last  few\r\n\r\ndays to an All-Party Committee for its observations\r\n\r\nand   for   some  reconciliation  of  the  proposed\r\n\r\nboundaries with the limits of the general  election\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we object to this in principle. You will\r\n\r\nfind  if you refer to clauses 5 and 15 of the Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Bill  with which we  shall  be  dealing\r\n\r\nlater, that it is provided there that no alteration\r\n\r\nshall  be  made to the limits of the  City  or  the\r\n\r\nDistricts  unless  and until such alterations  have\r\n\r\nbeen  notified in four successive Gazettes  and  in\r\n\r\nthe newspapers of four different languages with  an\r\n\r\ninvitation to persons to make objections. We intend\r\n\r\nwhen  we come to the Local Government Bill to  move\r\n\r\namendments  to add a proviso that these alterations\r\n\r\nshould be notified in respect of the new limits  to\r\n\r\nthe  City and the Districts which are of course the\r\n\r\nmost important ones of all and of very considerable\r\n\r\nproportions.  It  is our view, therefore,  that  if\r\n\r\nthis  is  to be found in the Local Government  Bill\r\n\r\nwith regard to the City limits, the same principles\r\n\r\nshould  be  applied to the electoral divisions,  to\r\n\r\nthe Bill now in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Sir, an All-Party Committee is not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  set up to consider these  boundaries\r\n\r\ndespite a request that this be done, and the result\r\n\r\nis  that  Government does lay itself  open  to  the\r\n\r\ncharge  of manipulation of the electoral boundaries\r\n\r\nto  suit  party  interests if  the  boundaries  are\r\n\r\nimposed  on  people  and  are  not  open  to   such\r\n\r\nrepresentations. Any government, I  am  sure,  will\r\n\r\nnot wish to make themselves a party to that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuspicion.  It  is therefore in our view  essential\r\n\r\nthat  this  matter  should  be  considered  in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  stage. I do not propose, Sir,  to  speak\r\n\r\nfurther on it at this stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  rise  to  second the amendment. I  believe  that\r\n\r\nunder  clause 8 of this Local Government  Elections\r\n\r\nBill the Minister is given considerable powers, and\r\n\r\nthat this clause should be read in conjunction with\r\n\r\nthe intention of Government trying to force through\r\n\r\nwhat  seems to me to be something in the  interests\r\n\r\nof the governing Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will put a few instances before you, Sir. I\r\n\r\nhave just received information that Government  has\r\n\r\nalready   set  up  a  Committee  to  consider   the\r\n\r\ndivisions  of  the City Council  and  that  it  has\r\n\r\nalready made up its mind as to what it should be. I\r\n\r\nunderstand  the recommendations have  already  been\r\n\r\naccepted  by  the  Minister for  Local  Government,\r\n\r\nLands  and  Housing  (Inche Abdul  Hamid  bin  Haji\r\n\r\nJumat)  as  well as by the Council of Ministers.  I\r\n\r\ntake it, Sir, that in the matter of elections,  not\r\n\r\njust  the interests of one Party are involved,  nor\r\n\r\neven  the  interests  of the governing  Party;  the\r\n\r\ninterests of all political Parties are concerned. I\r\n\r\nhave  glanced through a little part of  the  Report\r\n\r\nand  I  am  alarmed, Sir, at the way the Government\r\n\r\nhas fixed the divisions. At best, it can be said to\r\n\r\nbe  political  manoeuvring. There is  the  case  of\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar being given three representatives  in\r\n\r\nlocal  council elections, but Cairnhill  is  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  only  a little more than one, say one-and-a-half  to  two,  and Tanglin also one-and-a-half.  I\r\n\r\nhave  noted the reasons given. The Report says that\r\n\r\nthis  is  based on the estimated electoral strength\r\n\r\nbut I cannot understand, from what I have seen, why\r\n\r\nin  one  area with about 30,000 people  the  voting\r\n\r\nstrength is calculated at 18,000 while for  another\r\n\r\narea  with  about  the same number  of  people  the\r\n\r\nvoting  strength is put at 12,000. How  were  these\r\n\r\nfigures established? Did Government have statistics\r\n\r\nto  support its calculations of estimates of future\r\n\r\nvotes? Is it that one area consists mainly of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren, or in another that there are more aliens?\r\n\r\nThe  disparity in the figure is too great  to  make\r\n\r\nthem true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has also stated that one line it\r\n\r\nfollowed  is community interest but I fail  to  see\r\n\r\nthis  being  followed, especially in the  Cairnhill\r\n\r\narea  where one section of predominantly local-born\r\n\r\npeople,  in  Emerald Hill Road, is carved  out  and\r\n\r\nincluded  with  other  divisions.  Where   is   the\r\n\r\nsimilarity  of community interest in this  grouping\r\n\r\nof  different peoples? The statement  is  just  not\r\n\r\nconvincing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can quote more examples of how things are\r\n\r\nbeing manipulated. In the case of Whampoa, we  find\r\n\r\nthat  the area is going to sprawl over to Serangoon\r\n\r\nRoad  and  to embrace Kallang right up  to  Kallang\r\n\r\nRoad,  instead of going East into Potong  Pasir  or\r\n\r\nwest into Rangoon Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such are the inconsistencies suggested by the\r\n\r\nCommittee  set up by the Government. The Government\r\n\r\nmay  say  it  is  a  Committee consisting  only  of\r\n\r\nGovernment officials and that no Party is  involved\r\n\r\nand  not one single Party is represented on it. Let\r\n\r\nme  say, however, that Government servants have  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out the policy of the Government;  they  are\r\n\r\nthe  servants of the Government and the  Government\r\n\r\nin power is that of the Labour Front Coalition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the elections provided for in this Bill\r\n\r\nshould be carried out in the most fair manner, fair\r\n\r\nto   all   Parties  concerned,  and  an   All-Party\r\n\r\nCommittee should be set up to give its views on the\r\n\r\nmatter. As matters stand, the Government is using a\r\n\r\nvery  unfair way of getting a favourable  position.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal-Socialist Party wants the elections  to\r\n\r\nbe  fair and nothing else. It feels that Government\r\n\r\nshould be a responsible one, that it should not try\r\n\r\nto force other Parties to accept what it feels will\r\n\r\nbe  good  only to itself. If the Government  thinks\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  elections it needs  a  handicap,  it\r\n\r\nshould  ask for it - probably it would get it. If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  feels that it can fight  the  elections\r\n\r\nonly after tying up its opponent's hands, it should\r\n\r\ndeclare  its  intentions. But it will really  be  a\r\n\r\nshameful matter if it seeks an advantage by  hiding\r\n\r\nbehind a so-called non-Party Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly feel, Sir, that clause 8 should be\r\n\r\nincluded for reconsideration in Committee, in which\r\n\r\nwe  will  explain fully our stand. Sir,  I  beg  to\r\n\r\nsecond the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> it has been moved as an amendment to\r\n\r\nthe  original Question, after \"2,\" to insert  \"8,\".\r\n\r\nThe  Question is, \"That the figure proposed  to  be\r\n\r\ninserted, be there inserted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nnotice  with some interest that this \"very serious\"\r\n\r\nmatter  now  brought  forward  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin [Mr John Ede] and his colleague the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon [Mr Lim Choon Mong] was apparently\r\n\r\nnot  in  their  minds at all when this  clause  was\r\n\r\nconsidered  in the Select Committee on  this  Bill.\r\n\r\nFor  according to the Report this clause was agreed\r\n\r\nto with no particular discussion and there was only\r\n\r\none fairly minor technical arrangement. That is not\r\n\r\naltogether  surprising on second thoughts,  because\r\n\r\nit  does  seem  to  me that there  is  a  very  big\r\n\r\ndifference  between  the  boundaries  of   District\r\n\r\nCouncils  and the City Council, and the  boundaries\r\n\r\nof  divisions.  When the Select  Committee  on  the\r\n\r\nLocal   Government   Bill   was   considering   the\r\n\r\nboundaries  between  the  City  Council   and   the\r\n\r\nDistrict  Councils, there was, as the  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanglin said, a great discussion, and that is a\r\n\r\nmatter  on  which  I have no doubt  there  will  be\r\n\r\nfurther  debate. Now a decision whether or  not  to\r\n\r\nput  a  certain area within the boundaries  of  the\r\n\r\nCity Council or within the boundaries of a District\r\n\r\nCouncil is a matter which must affect very directly\r\n\r\nevery  person living within that area,  because  in\r\n\r\nthe  one case his affairs and rates and taxes  will\r\n\r\nbe  in  the hands of the City Council, and  in  the\r\n\r\nother case those affairs will be in the hands of  a\r\n\r\nDistrict  Council. But I see no  parallel  at  all,\r\n\r\nSir,  between this and the division of an area into\r\n\r\nconstituencies for the purpose of polling. I  would\r\n\r\nhazard the opinion, Sir, that the ordinary voter in\r\n\r\nSingapore has very little personal interest whether\r\n\r\nhe  goes  to  a  polling station in a  constituency\r\n\r\ncalled Cairnhill or one called Tanglin,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhatever name you would like to suggest. The  first\r\n\r\nconcern  of  the  voter surely is  merely  that  he\r\n\r\nshould  be  able  to  exercise his  vote  with  the\r\n\r\nminimum  inconvenience, that is  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\npolling station should be reasonably near his place\r\n\r\nof residence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The persons who are concerned with the division\r\n\r\nof  the  City Council into electoral constituencies\r\n\r\nare, of course, the political Parties, and that,  I\r\n\r\nthink, is the rub of this issue, and the real  case\r\n\r\nfor  recommitting clause 8 is the case that was put\r\n\r\nby  the hon. Member for Serangoon. I regret that he\r\n\r\nshould  feel  that  he must regard  the  boundaries\r\n\r\nwhich   have   been  drawn  up   as   having   been\r\n\r\nmanipulated.  He  said he could  not  believe  that\r\n\r\nthese  boundaries had been drawn up in an objective\r\n\r\nway   without  Party  bias  and  without  a  policy\r\n\r\ndirective  from the Government. Sir,  I  cannot  of\r\n\r\ncourse deny him his beliefs or his views, but I can\r\n\r\nsay  that  this task of dividing the new City  area\r\n\r\ninto  32  constituencies was a task  tackled  by  a\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  officials with no  policy  directive\r\n\r\nfrom  Ministers other than the basic  directive  to\r\n\r\ndraw  up 32 areas on the basis of the franchise  as\r\n\r\nlaid  down  in  the Bill. And it was  very  much  a\r\n\r\ntechnical  problem. In fact I think if  members  of\r\n\r\nany  political Party were to try to divide the City\r\n\r\narea  into  32 constituencies in order to  rig  the\r\n\r\nelections they would have very great difficulty  in\r\n\r\ndoing so without arriving at an answer which would,\r\n\r\non  the  face of it, be absurd. It is not  an  easy\r\n\r\ntask  to  divide  a City area into  constituencies.\r\n\r\nThere  are  a  number of considerations  which  are\r\n\r\ndecisive,  The  first is to try to  get  boundaries\r\n\r\nwhich    do   have   some   natural,   self-evident\r\n\r\njustification, such as the line of a stream or  the\r\n\r\nline  of  a  water  channel or some  other  natural\r\n\r\nboundary: and the second consideration is to try as\r\n\r\nfar  as  possible  to  get approximately  the  same\r\n\r\nnumber of voters in each division. That latter task\r\n\r\ncannot of course at the moment be based on definite\r\n\r\nfigures.  The  hon. Member for Serangoon  indicated\r\n\r\nthat  he thought the figures on which the Committee\r\n\r\nworked  were not reliable ones, implying that  they\r\n\r\nhad not been properly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestimated. Now it is impossible to prove  how  many\r\n\r\nvoters we shall find in any given area. All we  can\r\n\r\ndo  is to take the total number of people living in\r\n\r\nan area, which we can get, and having regard to the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  present  voters in the  area,  look  as\r\n\r\nintelligently as we can at the make-up of that area\r\n\r\nand  then estimate what effect the introduction  of\r\n\r\naliens  who  have lived there for five  years  will\r\n\r\nhave on the rolls. It was because an allowance  was\r\n\r\nmade for an uneven incidence of voters coming on to\r\n\r\nthe  rolls  that  you find that  in  some  existing\r\n\r\nconstituencies, the subdivision is greater than  in\r\n\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no attempt whatsoever to make the\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar division into three divisions because\r\n\r\nwe think the three new divisions will be won by any\r\n\r\none  political Party; it has been done entirely  on\r\n\r\nobjective   considerations   of   trying   to   get\r\n\r\napproximately  the same number of persons  in  each\r\n\r\ndivision,  following  as far  as  possible  natural\r\n\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there have been several cases where the\r\n\r\nnatural  boundary,  and in particular  an  existing\r\n\r\nboundary which is known, gave us a result which did\r\n\r\nnot seem to be acceptable. One case was that of the\r\n\r\nCairnhill  constituency. We had too many people  in\r\n\r\nthe  proposed Cairnhill division and not enough  in\r\n\r\nthe neighbouring division to the West. The solution\r\n\r\nadopted  was to remove a certain number of  persons\r\n\r\nwho  now live in the Cairnhill area and switch them\r\n\r\nto  the neighbouring area (I forget the exact  name\r\n\r\nof  it). The reason this particular area was chosen\r\n\r\nwas  that  it  seemed to be the area  most  closely\r\n\r\nrelated to the other division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry that hon. Members opposite should\r\n\r\nadopt  the  view  that the Committee  worked  to  a\r\n\r\npolitical directive and was not being objective.  I\r\n\r\ncan  only  assure you that that was not  so  and  I\r\n\r\nwould add one last word, Sir, which is that if hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  contemplate any considerable  revision  of\r\n\r\nthe boundaries of divisions at this stage, then  it\r\n\r\nwill not be possible to have City\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil  elections in December.  I  am  not  for  a\r\n\r\nmoment denying this House the opportunity, if it so\r\n\r\nwishes,    to   revise   the   electoral   division\r\n\r\nboundaries.  If  it wishes to do that,  let  it  be\r\n\r\ndone.  But what I would say is if that is  done  to\r\n\r\nanything more than a very, very minor extent,  City\r\n\r\nCouncil elections cannot be held in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat  has just been said is new to me. In the  last\r\n\r\nfew  minutes  I have been told that Government  has\r\n\r\nfinalised  the demarcation of divisions within  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council and that a Report has been circulated\r\n\r\nto  all Parties concerned. This is another case  of\r\n\r\nthe  Independents being snubbed. I cannot  see  why\r\n\r\nthat Report should not be circulated to Independent\r\n\r\nMembers as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Secretary has said that it is\r\n\r\nnot  the  duty  or responsibility of voters  to  be\r\n\r\nconcerned in the fixing of boundaries. I  think  he\r\n\r\nis  entirely  wrong and I do not  agree  with  him.\r\n\r\nVoters  in  each division, whether  attached  to  a\r\n\r\npolitical  Party or not, are greatly  concerned  in\r\n\r\nthe  demarcation of boundaries as they may wish  to\r\n\r\nput  up their own candidates who may not belong  to\r\n\r\nany  Party. They have a right if they want  to,  to\r\n\r\nnominate  their own candidates as Independents  and\r\n\r\nit is therefore their concern that they should know\r\n\r\nwhere  their electoral boundaries are.  I  am  very\r\n\r\nglad  that the Chief Secretary (or is it the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Serangoon?)  has  said  that  it  is  not   a\r\n\r\ndemarcation by the Government Party. It  is  a  few\r\n\r\nGovernment officials who have been directed by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Party to demarcate such divisions. There\r\n\r\nis  all the more reason why the Report should  have\r\n\r\nbeen   brought   to  this  Assembly   rather   than\r\n\r\ncirculated  to  all  Parties  concerned.  In   this\r\n\r\nAssembly we have the Government Party which  is  an\r\n\r\nalliance government of three political Parties, and\r\n\r\non  the  Opposition  benches we have  the  Liberal-Socialists and the P.A.P. I am quite sure  that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore we have more political Parties than  what\r\n\r\nwe  have  here. There is the Party Ra'ayat and  why\r\n\r\nshould  not this Party be consulted then?  I  think\r\n\r\nthe Government may not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsider  that  the Party Ra'ayat  is  a  political\r\n\r\nParty,  and  if that be so, why then register  that\r\n\r\nParty  as  a political Party? The Independents  are\r\n\r\nalways  snubbed  for one reason  or  another.  This\r\n\r\nconcerns the elections and it affects not only  the\r\n\r\nMembers of this Assembly but also the whole  public\r\n\r\nas  well.  I  would  therefore like  to  record  my\r\n\r\nprotest  at  the way in which the Independents  are\r\n\r\ntreated in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my\r\n\r\ncolleague  the  Chief Secretary has  explained  the\r\n\r\nworking  of this official Committee that  has  been\r\n\r\nset up by the Government.

What the Chief Secretary\r\n\r\nhas  said is this: that the voter is interested  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  he  has a vote and he is not  interested\r\n\r\nwhether it is to be this part of Cairnhill or  that\r\n\r\npart of Cairnhill.

On principle it  is\r\n\r\nadvisable to have the work of this Committee placed\r\n\r\nbefore all political Parties. If there has been  no\r\n\r\ngerrymandering  it would be obvious  to  everybody,\r\n\r\nand  everybody  would  then  be  quite  happy.  But\r\n\r\nwhether  or not there has been an unconscious  bias\r\n\r\nin  the  work of any official so as to justify  the\r\n\r\nallegations  made by the Member for Serangoon,  one\r\n\r\ncan   only   judge  from  the  vehemence   of   his\r\n\r\nallegations and the corresponding vehemence of  the\r\n\r\ndenials  of  the  Chief  Minister  and  the   Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary. Nothing would be lost if the reasons for\r\n\r\nthe  delineations  are placed before  an  All-Party\r\n\r\nCommittee.

Members will have observed, the Report\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Select Committee is very voluminous.  In\r\n\r\nacknowledgement of the importance of this  Bill,  a\r\n\r\ngreat deal of time and effort has been given to it.\r\n\r\nMany meetings of the Select Committee were held, in\r\n\r\nthe    course   of   which   written    and    oral\r\n\r\nrepresentations   from  the   City   Council,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Ratepayers Association, the Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  others were considered  and  several\r\n\r\nhundred amendments were studied. A great number  of\r\n\r\namendments have been made to the Bill as  a  result\r\n\r\nof  these  representations. Conversely,  Government\r\n\r\nfound that it was not in agreement with a number of\r\n\r\nthe  proposals put forward and was therefore unable\r\n\r\nto vary the clauses in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members  will expect me to apprise  them  of\r\n\r\nthe  main amendments which have been made and  also\r\n\r\nto   refer   to   the  proposed  amendments   which\r\n\r\nGovernment  was unable to accept. I hope  you  will\r\n\r\nbear with me as this will be a lengthy business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the definition \"City\" in clause 3,\r\n\r\nalso  alterations  to  boundaries  referred  to  in\r\n\r\nclauses  5 and 15, and the description of the  City\r\n\r\nboundary in the First Schedule, objections  opposed\r\n\r\nthe exclusion of part of Katong from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCity  on  the  one hand, and the expansion  of  the\r\n\r\nwestern  boundary  on the other. Various  arguments\r\n\r\nwere  applied. In the case of Katong, it  was  said\r\n\r\nthat  the Merdeka Bridge and Nicoll Highway brought\r\n\r\nKatong closer to the City; that residents in Katong\r\n\r\nnow paid City rates and would lose the benefits  of\r\n\r\nCity   services  and  such  amenities;   and   that\r\n\r\nresidents of Katong would be mulct by the  District\r\n\r\nCouncil  in favour of the less developed  areas  of\r\n\r\nthe District.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was a further argument that the\r\n\r\npresent  division of Katong into two parts - along  a\r\n\r\nsmall   canal - only  achieved  a  splitting  of   an\r\n\r\notherwise homogeneous community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the western boundary, Sir, it was\r\n\r\nsaid  that  a  purely rural area was wrongly  being\r\n\r\nbrought  into the City and that its interests  were\r\n\r\ndissimilar  from those of the City, and  also  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  danger of increased  rating  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government disagrees with these views. Government\r\n\r\nhas   taken  into  account  much  wider  and   more\r\n\r\nsubstantial   considerations.   The   division   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Island  into  City  and  District  local\r\n\r\nauthorities  takes  into  account  not   only   the\r\n\r\ndesirability  of  having  three  (and  later  four)\r\n\r\nequally  balanced Districts, but in doing so  takes\r\n\r\ninto  account future proposals as envisaged in  the\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan by which new towns will be  developed,\r\n\r\none  at  Jurong, one at Bukit Panjang, and  one  at\r\n\r\nSerangoon,   each   with  fairly  evenly   balanced\r\n\r\npopulations. At Katong there is no proposal  for  a\r\n\r\nnew  town. Instead, the urban population will  form\r\n\r\nthe centre of the new District. It is thought that-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

As regards services, the suggestion that\r\n\r\nthese would be less beneficial consequential on the\r\n\r\nchange is not accepted by Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also if hon. Members will turn to the\r\n\r\ntransitional  provisions of clause 323,  they  will\r\n\r\nappreciate that these can be applied in  the  early\r\n\r\nstages  of the changeover, which may probably  only\r\n\r\nlast,  say, six to eight months. Nor is it  thought\r\n\r\nlikely  that residents of Katong will be  mulct  by\r\n\r\ntheir  own District Council and on which they  will\r\n\r\npresumably  be  properly  represented.  As  regards\r\n\r\ncommunity interest at Katong, it is agreed that the\r\n\r\nmore  densely populated urban population which will\r\n\r\nform   the  nucleus  of  the  Katong  District   is\r\n\r\nhomogeneous, but it is doubtful if the  urban  part\r\n\r\nhas  an  over-riding community  interest  with  the\r\n\r\nresidential  area of Katong which is to  remain  in\r\n\r\nthe  City.  The boundary - the canal - is an  old  City\r\n\r\nboundary and may be regarded as an extension of the\r\n\r\nline of the Green Belt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the western boundary, again this is\r\n\r\nthe line of the Green Belt beyond which City, urban\r\n\r\nand  industrial development is restricted  to  stop\r\n\r\nindefinite  sprawl.  Again  it  forms  part  of  an\r\n\r\noverall  plan.  These new areas  are  not  strictly\r\n\r\nrural - they are not agricultural - they are, in  fact,\r\n\r\nurban    or   suburban   and   include   industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment  along the West Coast Road,  the  large\r\n\r\nareas  occupied  by  the Armed Forces  and  housing\r\n\r\nestates of Queenstown and the residential areas  of\r\n\r\nHolland  Road  as  well as further  similar  future\r\n\r\ndevelopments. This area should not, for example, be\r\n\r\ncompared  with the rural areas of Ulu Pandan  which\r\n\r\nlie outside the City boundary. Government considers\r\n\r\nthat  these wider and planned measures considerably\r\n\r\noutweigh   questions  of  rates  and  fears   about\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the constitution of the City and\r\n\r\nDistrict   Councils   in   clauses   6   and    16,\r\n\r\nrepresentations were made to increase the number of\r\n\r\nCouncillors from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32 to 48 in the case of the City, and from 12 to 18\r\n\r\nin  the  case  of  the District Councils.  Further,\r\n\r\nsuggestions  were also made that  there  should  be\r\n\r\nAldermen  appointed to the City Council. Government\r\n\r\nwas  not able to accept these proposals as  it  was\r\n\r\nnot  convinced  that  these increases  were  either\r\n\r\ndesirable or necessary. It considers that  a  great\r\n\r\nimprovement  on the \"City and Island  Council\", as\r\n\r\nenvisaged in the Rendel Constitution with  only  32\r\n\r\nmembers,  has been made since there will under  the\r\n\r\nnew   constitution  be  a  total  of   68   elected\r\n\r\nCouncillors, plus three Chairmen and nine nominated\r\n\r\nCouncillors, plus a fourth Council later  on.  With\r\n\r\nthe  adoption  of  these further  proposals,  there\r\n\r\nwould  be the danger of over-representation,  since\r\n\r\nit  should  be  borne in mind that  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are also to be represented under the  new\r\n\r\nconstitution by 51 Assemblymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small island like Singapore there is bound\r\n\r\nto   be  an  overlap  of  interests  between  local\r\n\r\ngovernment   and  State  business  and   there   is\r\n\r\ntherefore  a real danger of creating a multiplicity\r\n\r\nof    authorities    and    of   over-organisation,\r\n\r\nparticularly as the electoral boundaries for  local\r\n\r\ngovernment  and  the Assembly in the  City  may  be\r\n\r\ncoterminous. It was also represented that increases\r\n\r\nwould  enable  the  City  Council  to  conduct  its\r\n\r\nbusiness  more  expeditiously  and  efficiently  by\r\n\r\nenabling  it to appoint larger Standing  Committees\r\n\r\nand  to  delegate authority to them. Government  is\r\n\r\nnot  aware  of  inefficiency in  the  present  City\r\n\r\nCouncil on account of inadequate numbers and in any\r\n\r\ncase the numbers are to be increased from 27 to 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would perhaps be of assistance if the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  made  use  of the provisions  of  the  new\r\n\r\nclause  47  (old clause 49) which gives  powers  to\r\n\r\ndelegate  authority  to  a Committee  and  also  to\r\n\r\ndelegate  authority to its employees.  As  the  new\r\n\r\nCouncillors become more experienced, they may  wish\r\n\r\nto consider these provisions, since it appears from\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Member for Tanglin had to say in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  that about 80 per cent of the  decisions\r\n\r\nin  the  City Council require confirmation  by  the\r\n\r\nfull Council, and that authority is not delegated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning Aldermen, Government takes the view\r\n\r\nthat this system, under which the persons nominated\r\n\r\nprobably  share the political views  of  the  Party\r\n\r\nwhich  nominates them, is less attractive  than  an\r\n\r\nall-elected representation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the qualifications of candidates\r\n\r\nfor  election  in clause 21, I said at  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading  of the Bill, Sir, that Government intended\r\n\r\nto  follow  the policy which is laid  down  in  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper to the effect that in the City Council\r\n\r\nthe ability to speak \"Mandarin or Malay or Tamil or\r\n\r\nEnglish\"   would  be  the  qualification  required,\r\n\r\nwhereas in the Districts the ability to speak  \"any\r\n\r\nChinese dialect or Malay or Tamil or English\" would\r\n\r\nbe  the qualification required. Government has  not\r\n\r\nagreed  that in the City area \"any Chinese dialect\"\r\n\r\nshould take the place of Mandarin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, however, Sir, Government is following\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative  Assembly language  qualification,\r\n\r\ntaking   the   view  that  in  an   urbanised   and\r\n\r\nsophisticated  local government area  such  as  the\r\n\r\nCity,  beset  as  it is with modern  and  technical\r\n\r\nproblems,  an  unlimited range  of  dialects  could\r\n\r\nseriously   impede  business.  In  the   Districts,\r\n\r\nhowever, where the tempo of business will  be  much\r\n\r\nslower  in  comparison,  and  where  insistence  on\r\n\r\nMandarin    would    seriously   hamper    adequate\r\n\r\nrepresentation,  this  was considered  to  outweigh\r\n\r\nexpediency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have noticed, Sir, with regard to\r\n\r\nparagraph (d) that the restriction on candidates in\r\n\r\nDistricts having to stand for the division in which\r\n\r\nthey  reside has been removed. Under the amendment,\r\n\r\na  candidate can stand for any division within  the\r\n\r\nlocal authority in which he resides. Government did\r\n\r\nnot  agree to a proposal to debar a candidate  from\r\n\r\nstanding for election on account of blindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government was in agreement with the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin concerning the original clauses 31 and  35,\r\n\r\nboth  of which have been taken out of the Bill.  It\r\n\r\nwas considered that clause 31, which gave provision\r\n\r\nto  the  local  authority to  grant  gratuities  in\r\n\r\nspecial cases, was open to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabuse.  Concerning  clause 35,  by  implication  it\r\n\r\nwould  appear that employees of the local authority\r\n\r\ncan  run businesses in addition to their employment\r\n\r\nwith  the local authority. This clause was  thought\r\n\r\nto  be highly undesirable and accordingly has  been\r\n\r\ntaken out of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of rates, Government was not able\r\n\r\nto  agree with the proposed amendment to sub-clause\r\n\r\n(3)  of  clause  108 by the Member for  Tanglin  by\r\n\r\nwhich  the 30 per centum ceiling for rates  in  the\r\n\r\nCity   should   also  be  applied   to   Districts.\r\n\r\nGovernment took the view that the original wording,\r\n\r\nslightly  modified, would be more appropriate,  and\r\n\r\nthat  in  so  far as Districts were concerned,  the\r\n\r\nrates  shall not exceed fifteen per centum  without\r\n\r\nthe sanction of the Minister in writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government held the view that clause 109 was\r\n\r\nnecessary and should be retained in order  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  need for differential rating in the new  areas\r\n\r\naffected   by   the  changes  to   boundaries.   By\r\n\r\namendments   to  paragraphs  (a)   and   (b) ,   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of this clause will not only  apply  to\r\n\r\nthe  new  areas  but also to any part  thereof.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  in the case of Katong District,  for\r\n\r\nexample, it need not follow that the whole new area\r\n\r\nwhich  is  transferred  to  the  District  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  continue  to pay  City  rates - a  part\r\n\r\nthereof  could pay less, depending on the  services\r\n\r\nprovided and other such factors. Government did not\r\n\r\nagree  that clause 109 (b) could be dispensed  with\r\n\r\nas was suggested simply because of the amendment to\r\n\r\nclause  108  (3). Clause 109 specifically  concerns\r\n\r\nthe  change-over. The proviso to clause 108 (3) has\r\n\r\ngeneral  effect  and  is not concerned  with  those\r\n\r\nareas specifically covered under clause 109 (b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the provisions relating to the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  streets, an important  amendment  has\r\n\r\nbeen  made  to  sub-clause (15) of clause  142  the\r\n\r\neffect  of which is that unless the local authority\r\n\r\ndoes  not approve plans within two months of  their\r\n\r\nreceipt or resubmission, they shall be deemed to be\r\n\r\napproved. This amendment meets criticisms of delays\r\n\r\nand  should  ensure  that  business  is  done  more\r\n\r\nexpeditiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar amendment has been made in respect of\r\n\r\nthe  approval of plans for buildings in clause 169,\r\n\r\nby  which  a  similar time limit of two  months  is\r\n\r\nimposed under sub-clause (18). The reasons are  the\r\n\r\nsame - to expedite business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 170 is completely new. It supplements the\r\n\r\npowers  already  given under sub-clauses  (11)  and\r\n\r\n(13)  of  clause  169 and also clause  172  and  is\r\n\r\ndesigned  expressly to enable the local authorities\r\n\r\nto  take  action through the Courts to bring  about\r\n\r\nthe  speedy  demolition or removal of  unauthorised\r\n\r\nbuildings which are in the process of being  built.\r\n\r\nThe procedure is speedier since it does not have to\r\n\r\nawait  a  conviction as in the case of clauses  169\r\n\r\nand  172.  Such  measures are deemed  necessary  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  local authority to put a stop  to  the\r\n\r\nunauthorised  buildings  which  are  springing   up\r\n\r\neverywhere  regardless  of  planning  or   building\r\n\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 188 is also new. It makes much fuller\r\n\r\nprovisions than the clause which was disagreed, for\r\n\r\r\ntaking  immediate action, subject  to  the  Court's\r\n\r\ndirection, to prohibit persons remaining in ruinous\r\n\r\nor   dangerous  buildings.  In  extreme  cases  the\r\n\r\nbuilding may be demolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of clause 202, representations both\r\n\r\nfor  and against the City Council having the  power\r\n\r\nto  sell various kinds of electrical, gas and water\r\n\r\napparatus   and  appliances  were  considered.   On\r\n\r\nbalance,  Government decided in favour of the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  having the power to sell. This is not  the\r\n\r\nfirst  step  in nationalisation, Sir, as  has  been\r\n\r\nsuggested.  The  real  reasons  are  not   at   all\r\n\r\nsinister.  In  so far as electricity is  concerned,\r\n\r\nthe object is to reduce the cost of electricity  to\r\n\r\nthe  consumer by increasing consumption - especially\r\n\r\nin the non-peak periods in the day time and late at\r\n\r\nnight.  When  prices  are  artificially  high,  the\r\n\r\npublic  is  not inclined to buy. When equipment  is\r\n\r\nsold by the City Council at reasonable prices, more\r\n\r\nsuch  equipment  is bought and more electricity  is\r\n\r\nconsumed.  The  object  is to  offer  the  consumer\r\n\r\nreasonable terms for consumer appliances  and  good\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council's object is not to trade in non-consumer appliances such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  electric  bulbs  and electrical  wiring.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  interest  it may  soon  cease  to  sell\r\n\r\nelectrical  cookers  and fans because,  so  far  as\r\n\r\nthese   are   concerned,  the  trade   prices   are\r\n\r\nreasonable.  It  may also be of interest,  Sir,  to\r\n\r\nnote that the British Electricity Authority in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom, which is a public  body,  has  the\r\n\r\npower not only to sell consumer appliances but also\r\n\r\nto  manufacture them. It is also believed  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation the Central Electricity Board  have\r\n\r\nthe power to sell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards gas appliances on the other hand, it\r\n\r\nappears  that the City Council is the  sole  trader\r\n\r\nand it is therefore in the public interest that the\r\n\r\nCity  Council should continue to hire its equipment\r\n\r\nand  also,  as it does in some cases, to sell  such\r\n\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin sought to add a number of\r\n\r\nnew  clauses  with  which  Government  was  not  in\r\n\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have been a bit concerned\r\n\r\nat  the Minister's expressions, \"Government did not\r\n\r\nagree\" and \"Government agreed.\" I take it that what\r\n\r\nis really meant is that Government, since receiving\r\n\r\nthe  Report of the Select Committee, has agreed  or\r\n\r\ndisagreed with the views of the Select Committee. I\r\n\r\nwould   hate  to  think  that  Government,   as   a\r\n\r\nGovernment,  does or should endeavour to  influence\r\n\r\nthe proceedings of a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Yes, Sir, thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first new clause which was suggested by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin in the Select Committee  sought\r\n\r\nto  give  the District Councils power to appoint  a\r\n\r\nSecretary,  Treasurer,  Health  Officer,  Assessor,\r\n\r\nEngineer, Architect and other such appointments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second new clause is similar to the first in\r\n\r\nthat  it  provided  for  the Chairmen  of  District\r\n\r\nCouncils  to submit to their Councils each  year  a\r\n\r\nlist of posts which are necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third new clause provided for the District\r\n\r\nCouncil  Fund and properties vested in it  to  come\r\n\r\nunder  the  direction and control of the  District.\r\n\r\nAlso that all payments to and out of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Fund should be made by the Treasurer (appointed\r\n\r\nunder the first new clause).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since receiving the Report of the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, Sir, Government feels that it  does  not\r\n\r\ndisagree  with  the principles envisaged  in  these\r\n\r\nproposed  amendments  and, in fact,  endorses  them\r\n\r\nsince  it is intended that District Councils should\r\n\r\neventually be independent. At the Second Reading of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, I drew attention to the Explanatory Note\r\n\r\nwhich reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Provision is also made for District Councils to\r\n\r\nbe  run,  during  an  interim  period  after  their\r\n\r\nconstitution,  on lines similar  to  those  of  the\r\n\r\nRural  Board, particularly with regard to  finance,\r\n\r\nstaffing,  vesting of properties,  acquisition  and\r\n\r\ndisposal of land and other immovable property. When\r\n\r\nthese Councils have been set on their feet and have\r\n\r\nbecome  financially  viable,  amending  legislation\r\n\r\nwill  be  introduced  to enable  them  to  function\r\n\r\nindependently like the City Council.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon. Members will appreciate, Sir, that it is  not\r\n\r\npossible  to  create independent and 100  per  cent\r\n\r\nself-sufficient   District   Councils    overnight.\r\n\r\nMembership  of a local authority is  a  job  to  be\r\n\r\nlearnt.  The  weight  of  responsibility   we   are\r\n\r\nproposing to place upon these Councils is,  as  the\r\n\r\nMcNeice  Report points out, very considerable,  and\r\n\r\nexperience in the management of weighty affairs  is\r\n\r\nnot  immediately evident in these areas. It is  for\r\n\r\nsuch  reasons, as well as financial considerations,\r\n\r\nthat  a  measure of guidance of these  Councils  in\r\n\r\ntheir  early  years  is necessary  for  a  strictly\r\n\r\nlimited period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless it is agreed that District Councils\r\n\r\nshould  be as independent as practicable of control\r\n\r\nby  Government.  The Committee on Local  Government\r\n\r\nsought  for  a  system of financial  assistance  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  which would preserve local authorities'\r\n\r\nindependence, and it was thought that a  system  of\r\n\r\nequalisation grants would offer the best  solution.\r\n\r\nThis  matter is also referred to in paragraph 6  of\r\n\r\nthe White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these matters concerning the duties and\r\n\r\nresponsibility    of   District    Councils,    the\r\n\r\nfeasibility  of  a  system of equalisation  grants,\r\n\r\nstaffing, and all such considerations regarding the\r\n\r\nmachinery to establish District Councils are being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudied  by  a Working Party, the establishment  of\r\n\r\nwhich was referred to at paragraphs 210 and 211  of\r\n\r\nthe   McNeice  Report.  In  due  course,   amending\r\n\r\nlegislation  on the lines envisaged by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin  will be introduced, but  Government's\r\n\r\nview is that at present it is premature to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minor amendments have been made to the\r\n\r\ndescription  of District boundaries in  the  Second\r\n\r\nSchedule  which have also been illustrated  on  two\r\n\r\nmaps, Map A and Map B, attached to the Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first minor amendment which appears on Map A\r\n\r\nwas  simply  to draw the boundary to bring  in  the\r\n\r\nRoyal  Malayan Navy together with the  Naval  Base,\r\n\r\nrather than to have them artificially separated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment, in Map B, was to include\r\n\r\nNee  Soon Village in the Serangoon District Council\r\n\r\ninstead of in the Bukit Panjang District. Nee  Soon\r\n\r\nis comparatively remote from Bukit Panjang Village,\r\n\r\nand the lives of the residents of Nee Soon are more\r\n\r\nclosely  linked with those of the residents  living\r\n\r\nalong Sembawang Road and Thomson Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the whole of these boundaries\r\n\r\ndescribed in the First and Second Schedules, it has\r\n\r\nbeen  represented that they should be subjected  to\r\n\r\nthe  procedure  laid  down in  clauses  5  and  15.\r\n\r\nGovernment's view is that this procedure should  be\r\n\r\napplied to all subsequent amendments, but in so far\r\n\r\nas  these  major changes are concerned, forming  as\r\n\r\nthey  do  part of a new Bill, the proper place  for\r\n\r\nconsideration of them and debate on them is in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly alongside with all the other proposals  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  The  Report of the Committee  on  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  showing  in  \"map  form\"   the   first\r\n\r\nboundary  proposals has been available since  early\r\n\r\nin  1956.  The White Paper, Cmd. 30 of  1956,  with\r\n\r\nfirm  boundary  proposals, was  published  together\r\n\r\nwith  a  map  a  few  months later,  and  the  same\r\n\r\nboundaries  have been described in  the  Bill.  The\r\n\r\nproposed boundaries have, therefore, been  given  a\r\n\r\nthorough  airing  and  it is not  agreed  that  any\r\n\r\nfurther airing under clauses 5 and 15 is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Sir, many hundreds of\r\n\r\namendments  to  this Bill have been considered  and\r\n\r\nmade.  Many  of  them  are minor  improvements  and\r\n\r\ncorrections.   Others   take   into   account   the\r\n\r\nrepresentations  which  have  been  made.  I   have\r\n\r\nalready     mentioned    the     more     important\r\n\r\nrepresentations and amendments. The  final  results\r\n\r\nare,  of  course, incorporated in the Bill attached\r\n\r\nto  the  Report.  There are a few  more  amendments\r\n\r\nwhich I shall move. Members will have observed from\r\n\r\nthe  notice of amendments that all these additional\r\n\r\namendments  which I propose to move are minor  ones\r\n\r\nand  that  those which are to be made to  the  more\r\n\r\ncontroversial  clauses 21 and  108  are  of  little\r\n\r\nimportance  and  have little or no bearing  on  the\r\n\r\nmain issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members of the Assembly are conscious\r\n\r\nof  the  importance of this Bill, particularly  its\r\n\r\nspecial provisions for the establishment of several\r\n\r\nmore  democratic institutions in Singapore  Island.\r\n\r\nThe early enactment of the Bill is chiefly dictated\r\n\r\nby   the  urgent  and  widespread  desire  to  hold\r\n\r\nelections to the local government Councils as  soon\r\n\r\nas  possible and, more particularly, to  hold  City\r\n\r\nCouncil elections in December. Nevertheless Members\r\n\r\nof  the  Assembly may well feel that a little  more\r\n\r\ntime  should be given to consideration of the Bill.\r\n\r\nFor  this  reason, therefore, Sir, I shall  shortly\r\n\r\npropose that the Committee stage should be deferred\r\n\r\nuntil  Thursday,  25th July, for  which  purpose  a\r\n\r\nspecial sitting of the Assembly will be proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I should like to take this\r\n\r\nopportunity to thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir; but for\r\n\r\nyour  guidance  and assistance the Members  of  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee would not have completed their job\r\n\r\nwithin  the time which we had been able to  do  so.\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

I am sure  the\r\n\r\nHouse does not want to hear me make a comprehensive\r\n\r\nanswer which would only be a repetition of what can\r\n\r\nbe said at the Committee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are only one or two points that I wish\r\n\r\nto   make.  This  is,  as  the  Minister  said,  an\r\n\r\nimmensely  complex  Bill of  324  clauses  and  six\r\n\r\nschedules  which  affects the  man  in  the  street\r\n\r\nconsiderably, because the local government  is  the\r\n\r\nman  in  the  street's government to a  very  large\r\n\r\nextent.   It  has  already  been  said  that   many\r\n\r\namendments  were  moved  and  accepted  in   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee and many more were negatived. Many points\r\n\r\nhave  come to light in the Select Committee  as  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  intentions  which  were  not,  I\r\n\r\nthink,   appreciated  by  this  House  before   and\r\n\r\ncertainly  not  appreciated by me;  and  there  are\r\n\r\nother  points in which the Government's  intentions\r\n\r\nare  still obscure, if not to themselves, at  least\r\n\r\nto others. I only want to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngive  one  single example of this kind of obscurity\r\n\r\nas  I see it. It is with regard to the position  of\r\n\r\nthe  area  of Katong, Siglap and that part  of  Ulu\r\n\r\nBedok and Geylang Serai which it is proposed to put\r\n\r\ninto  a District Council. I do not propose to argue\r\n\r\nthe  advantages or disadvantages or that move  this\r\n\r\nafternoon; but there is one point - and it refers  to\r\n\r\nclause  323 - which  is extremely confusing.  If  you\r\n\r\nwill  refer, Sir, to the Explanatory Note  at  page\r\n\r\n199  of  the original Bill in the fourth paragraph,\r\n\r\nit says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Transitional provisions (see under clause 323\r\n\r\nbelow) have been included to enable the Rural Board\r\n\r\nto continue to perform its present functions in the\r\n\r\nRural  Board area and, pending the constitution  of\r\n\r\nthe District Councils, to administer those parts of\r\n\r\nthe  present City area which are to be merged  into\r\n\r\nthe new District Council areas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The Rural Board should administer those areas going\r\n\r\nout of the City into the District Councils. That is\r\n\r\nthe  explanatory note in the Bill which is what one\r\n\r\nunderstood  before it went to Select Committee.  In\r\n\r\nthe  Select  Committee  during  the  gathering   of\r\n\r\nevidence  from  the representations,  one  got  the\r\n\r\nimpression that if in the Katong area the  services\r\n\r\nsupplied by the Rural Board eventually deteriorated\r\n\r\nor  they were not able to carry them out, the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  would be asked to step in and assist.  But\r\n\r\nwhen  we  got through the Bill clause by clause  we\r\n\r\ndiscovered that that was not the case, but that the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  would  look after  the  district  of\r\n\r\nKatong  until  such  time as  the  Changi  District\r\n\r\nCouncil was able to provide the services that  that\r\n\r\narea should have. That is to be found in column 343\r\n\r\nof the Official Report where the Minister stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The provisions of clause 324, I should like to\r\n\r\nstress  to  the  Committee,  are  transitional  and\r\n\r\ndiscretionary. Read in relation to sub-clause  (4) ,\r\n\r\nit   clearly   indicates  that   this   is   purely\r\n\r\ntransitional legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very clear, Sir, that the Government feels\r\n\r\nthat at least during the first term of the district\r\n\r\ncouncil,  there should be this sort of arrangement.\r\n\r\nIt  also  thinks that the transitional period  will\r\n\r\nnot  last  the  full  term of  office  of  the  new\r\n\r\ndistrict council, that it is not going to last  for\r\n\r\nall time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  in  one sentence the Minister said \"at  least\r\n\r\nduring the first term of the district council\" this\r\n\r\nwill  be in operation and then he corrected  it  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  it  \"will  not last  the  full  term  of\r\n\r\noffice\",  and I believe I understood him to  say  a\r\n\r\nfew  minutes ago that it is now to be six or  eight\r\n\r\nmonths.  So  what  the  real  period  will  be   is\r\n\r\nanybody's guess, but I think I should read  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  particular sub-clause to  which  I  am\r\n\r\nreferring - clause 323 (2) - to justify my argument:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Notwithstanding any other provisions of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance  or the repeal of the Municipal Ordinance\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  may,  in  his discretion,  by  order\r\n\r\npublished  in  the  Gazette  and  subject  to  such\r\n\r\ndirections  as the Minister may from time  to  time\r\n\r\ngive  to  the City Council, authorise, empower  and\r\n\r\ndirect the City Council or any of its employees  to\r\n\r\ncontinue   to  have,  exercise  and  perform   such\r\n\r\nfunctions  duties, powers (including the powers  to\r\n\r\nlevy  rates  and  to charge fees), discretions  and\r\n\r\nauthorities  or  any  of  them  had  exercised   or\r\n\r\nperformed  by  the  City  Council  or  any  of  its\r\n\r\nemployees  under  the provisions of  the  Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and may likewise authorise, empower  and\r\n\r\ndirect the City Council or any of its employees  to\r\n\r\nrefrain  from  exercising such  functions,  duties,\r\n\r\npowers, discretions and authorities...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But  one was given to understand that, in point  of\r\n\r\nfact,  the City Council would administer this  area\r\n\r\ngoing  out of the District Council for a period  of\r\n\r\nthree  or  four  years. Now, Sir, the  position  is\r\n\r\nthis:  that  this new area will be in the  District\r\n\r\nCouncil.  It will have electoral divisions  in  the\r\n\r\nChangi    District   Council.   It    will    elect\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  this  area  to  sit  on  the\r\n\r\nDistrict Council, but the City Council will perform\r\n\r\nthe  administration. So you will have the  position\r\n\r\nof  your representatives of Katong, Siglap, part of\r\n\r\nUlu  Bedok and Geylang Serai sitting on one Council\r\n\r\nand  the  administration of that area being carried\r\n\r\nout by another Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have stated, there are very fundamental\r\n\r\nissues  involved in this Local Government Bill  and\r\n\r\nwe  are  not  satisfied that  they  are  all  being\r\n\r\ntackled in the right way - I have only given you  one\r\n\r\nexample.  But  the  other  problems  to  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  referred are very  big  problems - the\r\n\r\nlimits  to  the  City and District boundaries,  the\r\n\r\npowers and functions of District Councils, the size\r\n\r\nof the Councils and their languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferential rating, the status of the  Mayor  and\r\n\r\nso  on.

One  big\r\n\r\nproblem  in  the  City  area  is  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nhawkers. A great deal of oppression by minor  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  officials  and  sometimes  by  Government\r\n\r\nofficials  is  constantly going on, not  with  the\r\n\r\nconnivance of the Government or the City  Council,\r\n\r\nbut  simply  because  of the lack  of  ability  to\r\n\r\ncontrol   the   lower  officials  of   the   local\r\n\r\ngovernment  authority.  I will  at  the  Committee\r\n\r\nstage propose certain amendments as to what is  to\r\n\r\nbe  done  when  the property of hawkers  is  being\r\n\r\ndetained  by  the  police,  or  by  City   Council\r\n\r\nofficials. The present procedure in the  detention\r\n\r\nof  the  property of hawkers pending the trial  is\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory and it would be beneficial to clean\r\n\r\nadministration and to the hawkers if a  system  is\r\n\r\ndevised  whereby when property is seized a receipt\r\n\r\nis  given.  At  present no receipt is  given,  and\r\n\r\nalthough  part of the goods may subsequently  find\r\n\r\ntheir  way to the Social Welfare Department to  be\r\n\r\ndistributed to the poor when they are  ordered  to\r\n\r\nbe confiscated by the Police Magistrate, it is not\r\n\r\naltogether  certain that all the  articles  seized\r\n\r\nare eventually put through the proper channels. An\r\n\r\nabuse  of  this nature can be prevented if  it  is\r\n\r\nspecified beforehand that when goods and  property\r\n\r\nare sized, a receipt should be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to clause 255 I should like at the Committee\r\n\r\nstage  to  propose that the Government should  not\r\n\r\nextend the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npowers  of the Rural Board to require a permit  to\r\n\r\nbe  obtained  before  a well  is  dug.  One  could\r\n\r\nenvisage circumstances where a well having already\r\n\r\nbeen  dug is considered unhygienic or a danger  to\r\n\r\neither  health or person, and it may be  necessary\r\n\r\nto  order its closure. But to demand that a farmer\r\n\r\nor  a squatter should go through all the elaborate\r\n\r\nprocess of getting a permit before digging a  well\r\n\r\nis, in my opinion and I think in the opinion of  a\r\n\r\ngreat number of rural dwellers, an unnecessary bit\r\n\r\nof bureaucracy. Therefore at the Committee stage I\r\n\r\npropose  to move that this innovation of requiring\r\n\r\na  licence  before digging a well  should  not  be\r\n\r\naccepted and included in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Sir, I rise to second the\r\n\r\namendment to the amendment moved by the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar and reserve my right to speak  at  a\r\n\r\nlater stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to the amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Amendment as amended, agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, as amended, put and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Report from the Select Committee on the\r\n\r\nLocal  Government Bill, as contained in  Sessional\r\n\r\nPaper No. L.A. 10 of 1957, be adopted, subject  to\r\n\r\nthe  recommittal of the Bill in respect of clauses\r\n\r\n21,  67, 68, 81, 102, 108, 152, 154, 159, 256  and\r\n\r\n285  and clauses 3, 5, 6, 15, 16, 20, 22, 25,  26,\r\n\r\n29, 31, 39, 40, 41, 45, 60, 109, 143, 159, 168,\r\n\r\n216,  245,  284,  287, 293, 323, two  new  clauses\r\n\r\nimmediately  after clause 17, and one  new  clause\r\n\r\nafter  clause 101, the First Schedule, the  Second\r\n\r\nSchedule,  the  Third  Schedule,  and  the   Sixth\r\n\r\nSchedule and clauses 214 and 255 to a Committee of\r\n\r\nthe whole Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee on Thursday, 25th July, 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LABOUR (PROCEDURE - RECIPROCAL PROVISIONS)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>REGULATIONS, 1957</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move the motion\r\n\r\nin my name, namely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to section 174 of\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Ordinance,  1955  (No.  40  of  1955),\r\n\r\nresolves   that  the  Labour  (Procedure - Reciprocal\r\n\r\nProvisions)   Regulations,   1957,   published   as\r\n\r\nNotification  No.  S 166 in the Gazette  Supplement\r\n\r\nNo.  48  of  28th  June,  1957,  as  contained   in\r\n\r\nSessional Paper No. S.L. 13 of 1957, be approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regulations, the subject of my motion, have\r\n\r\nbeen  made by the Governor in Council under section\r\n\r\n172 of the Labour Ordinance.

In  both  these   instances   the\r\n\r\nGovernment issued strong warnings in the Press  and\r\n\r\nin  letters  to  the  Unions that  it  intended  to\r\n\r\nexercise  its powers under General Orders  207  and\r\n\r\n208. General Order 207 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Any officer who, without leave or reasonable\r\n\r\ncause,  is absent from duty for any period of  more\r\n\r\nthan  7  days  may  be  held to  have  vacated  his\r\n\r\noffice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And General Order 208 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(a) Absence from duty for any period whether\r\n\r\nmore  or  less  than  7  days,  without  leave   or\r\n\r\nsubsequent sanction, constitutes a break in service\r\n\r\nand  no  officer may be paid salary for any  period\r\n\r\nduring which he is so absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Head of Department is responsible for\r\n\r\nensuring that the proper deduction from salary  is\r\n\r\nmade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the uncertainty which this step has\r\n\r\ncreated and was designed to create in the minds  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  servants who were either on  strike  or\r\n\r\nintended  to  strike, I think  we  should  clarify,\r\n\r\nfirst  the  legal position, and second,  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not suggesting, as the former Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill did at one stage, that a strike should be\r\n\r\nlegalised in the form that it is a lawful breach of\r\n\r\na contract. The position in English law is that any\r\n\r\nstrike  constitutes a breach of the contract  which\r\n\r\nan employee enters into either orally or in writing\r\n\r\nwith  the  employer. But the Trade Union  Ordinance\r\n\r\nsays  that no union can be held responsible  either\r\n\r\nfor  conspiracy or for any other tort  in  bringing\r\n\r\nabout  the  breach of this contract as a result  of\r\n\r\ncollective action by the Union. Therefore,  in  any\r\n\r\nstrike  by  any  group of employees there  are  two\r\n\r\naspects to consider, first, that of the union,  and\r\n\r\nsecond, that of the individual members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as a union is concerned, there is no\r\n\r\noffence  either in law, criminal or civil.  But  as\r\n\r\nfar as a striking union member is concerned, in any\r\n\r\nstrike  he goes over from the province of law  into\r\n\r\nthat  of  politics; he is fighting it out with  his\r\n\r\nemployer. It then becomes a tussle of strength,  of\r\n\r\nbargaining  power,  between the  employer  and  the\r\n\r\nemployees  collectively. If the  strike  fails,  as\r\n\r\nsometimes  strikes are known to have  failed,  then\r\n\r\nthe  employees are sacked. In law he  can  be  sued\r\n\r\nindividually for breach of the contract of  service\r\n\r\nfor  not  having  given  the  required  notice   of\r\n\r\ntermination of service which may either be  implied\r\n\r\nor   expressed  in  his  contract.  If  the  strike\r\n\r\nsucceeds, then the union bargains collectively with\r\n\r\nthe  employer not only that its members  should  go\r\n\r\nback  without incurring any penalty for  breach  of\r\n\r\nthe  individual contract, but also that they should\r\n\r\ngo back on better terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it is with the Government, and for\r\n\r\nGovernment to introduce General Orders 207 and  208\r\n\r\ninto   a  trade  dispute  is,  in  my  opinion,   a\r\n\r\ndeliberate attempt to queer the pitch of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  workers. Every Government  servant  who\r\n\r\ngoes  on  strike,  acting  collectively  through  a\r\n\r\nunion,  runs  the  risk  of  having  breached   his\r\n\r\npersonal contract of service with his employer, and\r\n\r\nthat breach may not only bring about the forfeiture\r\n\r\nof  pensions, but also the right of the employer to\r\n\r\nsue  for  payment  in  lieu of notice,  implied  or\r\n\r\nexpressed,  in  his contract of service.  Therefore\r\n\r\nthere  is  in fact no difference in a strike  by  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of workers be they in the Government service\r\n\r\nor in private employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once you have accepted that, the Government,\r\n\r\nwhich  should  conduct  itself  as  a  model   good\r\n\r\nemployer,  should not go out of its way to  try  to\r\n\r\nbrow-beat  its employees by threatening  them  that\r\n\r\ntheir  pensions will be lost, or that they will  be\r\n\r\nassumed to have vacated their posts, just in  order\r\n\r\nto  prevent  collective action by a  group  of  its\r\n\r\nemployees. If the Government takes this stand,  the\r\n\r\nbluff  will  sooner or later be called because  one\r\n\r\ngroup of Government servants will go on strike, win\r\n\r\nthat  strike and compel the Government not only  to\r\n\r\ntake  them back with no break of service  and  with\r\n\r\npensions  secured, but also with better  conditions\r\n\r\nof service and enhanced remuneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should imagine, therefore, that it would be a\r\n\r\ngood  policy on the part of the Government  not  to\r\n\r\ntry  to  introduce  a  red  herring  into  a  trade\r\n\r\ndispute.  Government knows what the legal  position\r\n\r\nis. So do some, but not all, of the employees. What\r\n\r\nthe  Government is seeking to do is to make  us  of\r\n\r\nthis  ignorance of some of its servants to  try  to\r\n\r\nintimidate  them  into giving  up  their  right  of\r\n\r\ncollective action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not consider this matter vital enough to be\r\n\r\nthe  subject of a motion. I was approached by  both\r\n\r\nthe  Unions  involved to raise this matter  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  and  I  think it should  receive  proper\r\n\r\nventilation  in  this House. If the  Government  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to act in this high-handed and authoritarian\r\n\r\nmanner,  it  will be setting a bad example  to  all\r\n\r\nother employers. I therefore ask the Government  to\r\n\r\nconsider  seriously whether it is wise,  first,  to\r\n\r\nmake a threat, and second,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhaving made it to provoke its employees at a  later\r\n\r\ndate to call its bluff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nwelcome this opportunity to explain the position of\r\n\r\nGovernment  servants who go  on  strike  and  I  am\r\n\r\ngrateful  to the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  for\r\n\r\nhis  courtesy  in  giving  me  ample  time  to  say\r\n\r\nsomething in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the position is fully understood by the\r\n\r\nStaff Side of the Civil Service Joint Council and I\r\n\r\nthink it is also fully understood by the leaders of\r\n\r\nthe  big Staff Associations, but I do agree in part\r\n\r\nwith  the  hon. Member there are other sections  of\r\n\r\nthe  public  service,  particularly  those  led  by\r\n\r\npersons who are not themselves Government servants,\r\n\r\nwho do not yet understand this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before explaining the position, I should like\r\n\r\nto  deplore the continued emphasis in the terms  of\r\n\r\nthe  notice  given  by the hon. Member,  on  rights\r\n\r\nrather than duties, on the right to strike.  If  we\r\n\r\nwould  all apply ourselves wholly to our duties  to\r\n\r\nothers  and to the community, I think our so-called\r\n\r\nrights   would  look  after  themselves  and   that\r\n\r\nSingapore would be a better place. Public  servants\r\n\r\nare the servants of the public. They have a duty to\r\n\r\nserve the public and we should never forget that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, a Government officer holds office\r\n\r\nat  the  pleasure of the Crown and can be dismissed\r\n\r\nat  any time. That is the principle, the theory. In\r\n\r\npractice,  his employment is safeguarded  by  rules\r\n\r\nand  regulations designed to give him  security  of\r\n\r\ntenure  of  office, subject only to good behaviour.\r\n\r\nGovernment servants cannot be sacked arbitrarily by\r\n\r\na  senior  officer, as employees  in  industry  and\r\n\r\ncommerce can be and are. And as the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong   Pagar   indicated,  trade   unions   have\r\n\r\ndeveloped because of the exploitation of labour  by\r\n\r\nbad employers. It was because the individual worker\r\n\r\nhad  no remedy against the boss that workers banded\r\n\r\nthemselves together into trade unions and through\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade  union  organisations were  able  to  bargain\r\n\r\ncollectively with their employers from  a  position\r\n\r\nof  strength.  It  was because of  this  that  they\r\n\r\nadopted the final weapon of the strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar rightly\r\n\r\npointed  out, a strike is the withdrawal of  labour\r\n\r\nby  employees  designed to compel the  employer  to\r\n\r\nmake  concessions, and it amounts to a  termination\r\n\r\nof  a contract of service. It is a cruel weapon for\r\n\r\nthe  striker because he deliberately terminates his\r\n\r\ncontract  of service with his employer and  depends\r\n\r\non  successful  negotiations,  on  victory  in  the\r\n\r\nstrike, to get his job back again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Government servants have never been in the\r\n\r\nsame  position as other workers. They  have  always\r\n\r\nbeen  protected  by  a code of service  regulations\r\n\r\nfrom  victimisation and unfair treatment. They have\r\n\r\nalways   had  security  of  office,  a  fundamental\r\n\r\ncharacteristic  of  responsible  employment  by   a\r\n\r\ngovernment and indeed one which is often criticised\r\n\r\nby   members   of  the  public.  The  greater   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility which a Government officer has,  the\r\n\r\nmore   protection  does  he  get   from   arbitrary\r\n\r\ndismissal  or  unfair treatment.  Officers  on  the\r\n\r\npensionable establishment can only be dismissed  in\r\n\r\naccordance   with   a   complicated   semi-judicial\r\n\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have emphasised these privileges and the\r\n\r\nparticular position of Government servants  because\r\n\r\nthese  privileges  and  safeguards  in  the  public\r\n\r\nservice   must  carry  with  them  a  corresponding\r\n\r\nobligation   of  loyal  and  conscientious   public\r\n\r\nservice, a duty to serve the public and to put  the\r\n\r\npublic  interest first. The public rightly  expects\r\n\r\nthis  loyal  service.  Now  to  strike  is  clearly\r\n\r\ninconsistent  with loyal service to the  public.  A\r\n\r\nstrike puts the interests of those on strike before\r\n\r\nthe interests of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may ask what about genuine grievances? How\r\n\r\nare they to be put right if Government servants are\r\n\r\nnot  to  strike? And again I say, Sir, that  public\r\n\r\nservants  are  in  a  specially favoured  position.\r\n\r\nFirst   of  all,  they  are  employed  not  by   an\r\n\r\nindividual  boss  but  by the Government,  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is answerable and responsible to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  and  to public  opinion.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nevery  officer  has the right of  appeal  from  his\r\n\r\nimmediate  superior  right up to  the  Governor  if\r\n\r\nnecessary.   Thirdly,   we   have   strong    Staff\r\n\r\nAssociations  able  to  talk  with  authority   and\r\n\r\ninfluence.  Fourthly,  we have  the  Civil  Service\r\n\r\nJoint  Council  which  is  able  to  discuss  staff\r\n\r\nproblems  and grievances at the highest level;  any\r\n\r\nStaff  Association which gets the full  backing  of\r\n\r\nthe  Staff Side of the Civil Service Joint  Council\r\n\r\nis  certain  of  the utmost consideration  for  its\r\n\r\nclaims. And finally - and most important of all  in\r\n\r\nthis context of striking - the constituent members of\r\n\r\nthe  Staff Side of the Civil Service Joint  Council\r\n\r\nhave   the   right  to  take  the   Government   to\r\n\r\narbitration, the right to compel the Government  to\r\n\r\nsubmit a dispute to impartial arbitration, a  right\r\n\r\nwhich  several Staff Associations and  Unions  have\r\n\r\nexercised and are today exercising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I say, Sir, that a strike should be the last\r\n\r\nresort  of  any  association  of  public  servants,\r\n\r\nremembering  both their primary duty to  serve  the\r\n\r\npublic and the very special means at their disposal\r\n\r\nfor settling their grievances without resorting  to\r\n\r\nstrikes.  But  in  the  last resort  if  Government\r\n\r\nservants  insist on taking strike action, they  are\r\n\r\nof course at liberty to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept the proposition of the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar that a Staff Association or a  Union\r\n\r\nwhich  calls  a strike of Government officers  does\r\n\r\nnot, providing it observes certain limitations, lay\r\n\r\nitself  open  to any charge of having  committed  a\r\n\r\ncriminal or civil offence. The Government stated in\r\n\r\nthis  House  on  22nd May that  it  recognises  the\r\n\r\nfundamental  right of a trade union to strike.  But\r\n\r\nwhen a Government servant goes on strike, like  any\r\n\r\nother  person  going on strike  he  terminates  his\r\n\r\ncontract  and employment. He breaks faith with  his\r\n\r\nduty  of  service to the public who  pays  him  and\r\n\r\nsafeguards  him from arbitrary treatment.  He  also\r\n\r\nfaces certain peculiar consequences which flow from\r\n\r\nhis  position as a public servant whose  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service are governed  by  statutory\r\n\r\nrules and regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that all Government servants,\r\n\r\nbefore  they  resort to strike  action,  should  be\r\n\r\nfully  aware of these consequences which flow  from\r\n\r\ntheir special position. A Government servant who is\r\n\r\nabsent from duty on strike breaks his service, just\r\n\r\nas  any  other person on strike breaks his service.\r\n\r\nAnd  it follows that if a Government servant breaks\r\n\r\nhis service, he forfeits his pensions and his other\r\n\r\nservice  benefits  will  be  seriously  prejudiced.\r\n\r\nGovernment pensions are governed by law and the law\r\n\r\nquite  rightly  says  that to  count  for  pension,\r\n\r\nservice  must be continuous. Therefore a  break  in\r\n\r\nservice   caused  by  striking  will  automatically\r\n\r\nforfeit all previous service for pension purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very serious consequence indeed. It\r\n\r\nfollows   from  the  provisions  of  the   Pensions\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and from General Orders. And  it  is  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that Government servants do not  go  on\r\n\r\nstrike forgetting that they stand to forfeit  their\r\n\r\nprevious service that recently we have always tried\r\n\r\nto  issue  specific warnings. The hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  interprets  them  as  threats   and\r\n\r\nintimidation. I say we issue specific  warnings  to\r\n\r\nremind  them  that  if  they  do  carry  out  their\r\n\r\nintention to strike, there will be a break in their\r\n\r\nservice, they will be deemed to have vacated  their\r\n\r\noffices  and  they  will  therefore  forfeit  their\r\n\r\npensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to make sure that they realise that their\r\n\r\nposition  is  not the same as that of employees  of\r\n\r\nbus  companies or rubber factories. The hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor   Tanjong  Pagar  stated  that  there   is   no\r\n\r\ndifference between an employee of a private concern\r\n\r\nand  a  Government servant going on  strike.  That,\r\n\r\nSir, I submit with all respect, is a most dangerous\r\n\r\nmisconception.  There  is a fundamental  difference\r\n\r\nbetween  them  and the difference is this,  that  a\r\n\r\npublic  servant and his conditions of  service  are\r\n\r\ngoverned  by  the  law.  In  the  case  of   public\r\n\r\nservants,  it  is  not a matter  simply  of  direct\r\n\r\nbargaining  between a number of  employees  and  an\r\n\r\nemployer. Their conditions of service are  governed\r\n\r\nby the law. So I do not feel any remorse, Sir, over\r\n\r\nthe fact\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  warnings were issued. I have the notices  in\r\n\r\nfront  of  me here. What we did was to tell  these\r\n\r\nofficers    in    the   Customs   and    Education\r\n\r\nDepartments - let me read the one which  was  issued\r\n\r\nto the Customs Department:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"You are reminded that if you strike, you lay\r\n\r\nyourselves   open  to  dismissal   under   General\r\n\r\nOrders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  what do the General Orders say? They say that\r\n\r\nif you are absent from duty for any period of more\r\n\r\nthan  seven days, you may be held to have  vacated\r\n\r\nyour office, and that absence from duty will be  a\r\n\r\nbreak in service for which no pay can be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing is to bring home to public\r\n\r\nservants  that if they go on strike they do  stand\r\n\r\nto  lose  a  great  deal  more  than  an  ordinary\r\n\r\nemployee.  And  it  is  not  easy  or  necessarily\r\n\r\npossible  for  the  employer, the  Government,  to\r\n\r\nremedy  any consequences which may follow  from  a\r\n\r\nstrike.  I  am told, for example, that some  years\r\n\r\nago  in  Nigeria it was necessary to enact special\r\n\r\nlegislation in the Legislature to enable a  period\r\n\r\nduring which railway workers had been on strike to\r\n\r\ncount for pension purposes. I mention this to show\r\n\r\nthat  very  serious difficulties  will  stem  from\r\n\r\nstrike  action  by  Government  servants  who  are\r\n\r\npensionable.  I myself think that it  is  fitting.\r\n\r\nWhen  a  man is a pensionable public servant,  the\r\n\r\nstrike  should  be his very last  resort,  and  he\r\n\r\nshould  remember that if he does adopt it he  does\r\n\r\nso at his peril.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in  spite of all  the  explanation\r\n\r\ngiven by the Hon. the Chief Secretary, I think  he\r\n\r\nhas not even answered the argument put forward  by\r\n\r\nthe  hon.
