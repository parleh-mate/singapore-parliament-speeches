After so many years of stoppage\r\n\r\nof   new   registration,  there  are  still   many   such\r\n\r\nmotorcycles  running  on our roads.   The  poor  emission\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  such  vehicles is polluting the  environment\r\n\r\nbadly.  The amount of unburned hydrocarbons, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbluish  smoke  from  the burning of lubricants,  and  the\r\n\r\nodour have caused excessive pollution of our air, and are\r\n\r\nactually  making  it unbearable to our  road  users.   It\r\n\r\naffects  the  health of both pedestrians and  other  road\r\n\r\nusers.  The pollution generated is so bad that one should\r\n\r\navoid  trailing any such vehicle or to open up the window\r\n\r\nimmediately after you pass such vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For road users like us, who have invested so heavily\r\n\r\nin anti-pollution equipment in our cars and new trucks  - I  guess we pay about $3,000-$6,000 per car, inclusive of\r\n\r\ntax - is it not only fair for all the road users that  we\r\n\r\nconsider phasing out such air-polluting machines from the\r\n\r\nroad?   The  question I would like to ask is:  would  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  agree that the 2-stroke motorcycle is a  poorly\r\n\r\nfitted  and  air-polluting machine?  Should not  such  2-stroke  motocycles  be completely  phased  out  from  our\r\n\r\nroads?

Now,  I\r\n\r\nwant  to raise with the Minister for the Environment  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  dengue.   I  know that  there  is  no  vaccine\r\n\r\navailable  now  to treat dengue.  So,  the  only  way  to\r\n\r\nprevent  dengue  is to have an effective  vector  control\r\n\r\nprogramme  and  to  engage active  public  and  community\r\n\r\ninvolvement in the programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know whether the incidence of\r\n\r\ndengue  is  now  under control, and what  are  the  other\r\n\r\npreventive  measures that the Ministry of the Environment\r\n\r\nis implementing to control the incidence of dengue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, while we\r\n\r\nare  sitting  here  today, 150 government  ministers  and\r\n\r\nHeads  of States are now attending the Third World  Water\r\n\r\nForum in Kyoto, Japan, calling for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelp  for  1.4  billion  people without  access  to  safe\r\n\r\ndrinking water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a lot to be grateful for. The\r\n\r\nshortage  of our own source of water supply has  made  us\r\n\r\nventure into new sources of water, including NEWater  and\r\n\r\ndesalination.   To me, NEWater represents the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We  have shown that, in times  of  need,  we\r\n\r\nwould  master  technology and, with our  strong  will  to\r\n\r\nprotect  our independence, we are willing to do  what  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.   The result is NEWater.  But, I  suppose  the\r\n\r\nbattle  is  not over, because there are Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nare still relatively uncomfortable with NEWater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question is: what more is the Ministry doing\r\n\r\nto help Singaporeans to be more comfortable with NEWater,\r\n\r\nand  what  are  the  plans  to use  NEWater  through  the\r\n\r\nreservoirs?   In  fact, I was attending  a  meeting,  and\r\n\r\nsomeone said, \"Why is Singapore, which is very well-known\r\n\r\nfor  being  pragmatic,  not using  NEWater  directly  for\r\n\r\nconsumption, because it has been proven to be very  clean\r\n\r\nand  safe?\"   I  agree  with the approach  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Environment to take it step by step.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know what the plans are, in terms of\r\n\r\nour  use of more NEWater in our reservoirs.  What are the\r\n\r\nchallenges  to  NEWater in terms of acceptance,  and  how\r\n\r\nwill  the Ministry of the Environment manage it?  I would\r\n\r\nalso like to ask whether the Ministry would look at other\r\n\r\ntechnologies available, to make more new sources of water\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, I welcome the\r\n\r\nvarious  initiatives  that  the  Ministry  has  taken  to\r\n\r\ndiversify  and  sustain Singapore's future water  supply,\r\n\r\nand  I  think this has been a source of great reassurance\r\n\r\nto  all  Singaporeans.  The Minister has used  the  vivid\r\n\r\nanalogy  of  four  taps, primarily  the  catchment  water\r\n\r\nsupply, Johor water, desalinated water and NEWater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that I wish to raise here is that the\r\n\r\nnewer  taps, specifically desalinated water and  NEWater,\r\n\r\nare more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenergy-intensive sources of water supply.  If we look  at\r\n\r\nthe new water process, in particular the aspects of ultra-filtration,  reverse osmosis and ultra-violet  treatment,\r\n\r\nas  well  as  the  desalination process,  they  entail  a\r\n\r\ngreater  need for energy in order to generate the potable\r\n\r\nwater supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the question I have is whether we are\r\n\r\nsubstituting our reliance on imported water  with  a  new\r\n\r\ndependence  on imported oil or other sources  of  energy.\r\n\r\nDoes  this raise the question of a new vulnerability  for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  in  the sense that our new  source  of  water\r\n\r\nsupply  is  now going to be dependent on the  global  oil\r\n\r\nmarket  conditions?  This point is particularly pertinent\r\n\r\nat  this stage where there is considerable volatility  in\r\n\r\nthe  global  energy  market.  I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister for his assessment of the new reliance on energy\r\n\r\nfor  our  water supply, and whether there is  a  need  to\r\n\r\ndiversify,  away  from  this vulnerability,  through  new\r\n\r\ntechnologies and, perhaps, new sources of energy as well.\r\n\r\nIf  so, what measures are being taken by the Ministry for\r\n\r\nthat purpose?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, we are lucky to\r\n\r\nbe  able to take advantage of a new technology to produce\r\n\r\nNEWater, to avoid being arm-twisted by our neighbour, who\r\n\r\nproclaims  to  love our people's money.  I  am  confident\r\n\r\nthat,  with  the Government's multi-pronged  approach  on\r\n\r\nwater  provision, and with the many-taps-running concept,\r\n\r\nSingapore would be self-sufficient in our water supply in\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that being self-sufficient is not\r\n\r\nsufficient.  To benefit the people, the effort  in  self-sufficiency  in water must also translate  into  economic\r\n\r\nbenefits  for  our  people, ie, can Singaporeans  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  lower water tariffs as a result of self-sufficiency\r\n\r\nin  water supply?  The deep sewer tunnel project  is  one\r\n\r\nthat would provide the infrastructure for NEWater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the development, water-borne fees were raised\r\n\r\n100%  some  years  ago.   This has  increased  the  total\r\n\r\nutility bill size for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouseholds.  A water conservation tax of 30% was  imposed\r\n\r\non  the first 40 cubic metres of consumption, which means\r\n\r\nthat  every  household is subject to higher water  bills,\r\n\r\nunless  we  do  not use water at all.  The rationale  for\r\n\r\nthis  tax then was to gradually increase the water price,\r\n\r\nin   anticipation  of  higher  cost  of   water.    Water\r\n\r\nconsumption, at a higher quantity, is charged at a higher\r\n\r\nrate and tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we take all the charges and taxes in total,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are paying a high water rate.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  know  whether the water tariffs could be lowered,  in\r\n\r\nview  of the successful implementation of NEWater,  which\r\n\r\nis  less  costly than expected.  With the advancement  in\r\n\r\nmembrane  technology,  seawater  desalination   is   also\r\n\r\nexpected to cost less.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, the availability of\r\n\r\nNEWater   and  desalinated  water  should  not  make   us\r\n\r\ncomplacent.  I am happy to note that the Ministry of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  has  launched a comprehensive  programme  to\r\n\r\neducate  the public on how to prevent wastage of  potable\r\n\r\nwater.  What are the targets which the Ministry hopes  to\r\n\r\nachieve in this water conservation programme?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some domestic uses do not need potable water,\r\n\r\neg,  watering  of plants, washing of void  decks  of  HDB\r\n\r\nblocks,  as well as the cleaning of commercial buildings.\r\n\r\nWould  the Ministry consider a separate supply system  of\r\n\r\nwater  to households and commercial users for non-potable\r\n\r\nusage?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam See Tong is not present.\r\n\r\nProf. Low Seow Chay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

When  the 1961 Water  Agreement  with\r\n\r\nMalaysia  lapses, the alternative water  supply  will  be\r\n\r\nthrough  water recycling and desalination.  As  we  know,\r\n\r\nthe  cost of water recycling is higher than the raw water\r\n\r\nsupplied under the Water Agreement.  One may worry  about\r\n\r\nthe potential rise in the water price after the series of\r\n\r\nNEWater plants are in operation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement of the desalination contract\r\n\r\nawarded  to the private sector as a BOO project confirmed\r\n\r\nthe  cost of water from desalination.  The contract price\r\n\r\nfor desalination is about $0.80 per cubic metre, which is\r\n\r\nstill  lower  than the current domestic charge  of  water\r\n\r\neven  before the water conservation tax is included.   In\r\n\r\nmy  view, the Government should be able to keep the price\r\n\r\nof  water  for a long time, unless the basic  parameters,\r\n\r\neg, the energy cost, change substantially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man-in-the-street is worried about the rise in\r\n\r\nthe  water bill after the introduction of NEWater and the\r\n\r\nwater  from  desalination.  The question  is:  would  the\r\n\r\nMinistry commit that the price of water for domestic  use\r\n\r\nwould be kept at status quo until the expiry of the  1961\r\n\r\nWater Agreement?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, my topic is on waste\r\n\r\nminimisation.

What are\r\n\r\nthe  plans to bring the message across to a wider  cross-section  of  Singaporeans?  Who are the worst  wasters  - commercial  or  residential  users?

The target rate for this year  is\r\n\r\none in two households.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if he thinks\r\n\r\nthe target set for this year is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachievable.  What are the initiatives the Ministry  would\r\n\r\nbe adopting to achieve this target?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environment Ministry should be commended for its\r\n\r\nunstinting  efforts to promote recycling. Clearly,  there\r\n\r\nis   heightened   awareness  among   Singaporeans   about\r\n\r\nrecycling.   Nonetheless, unlike the urge to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nstall  with  the longest queue, recycling is  not  second\r\n\r\nnature to most Singaporeans.  Much more needs to be,  and\r\n\r\ncan be, done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education efforts should be stepped up. Young and\r\n\r\nold  must  be  educated  not  only  on  the  virtues   of\r\n\r\nrecycling,  but  also on the ABCs and best  practices  of\r\n\r\nrecycling.   They need to be taught what can be  recycled\r\n\r\nand  what cannot be, so that trash does not end up in the\r\n\r\nrecycling  bins.  They should be encouraged  to  separate\r\n\r\ntheir recyclables into different bags so that papers, for\r\n\r\ninstance, do not get damaged by wet cans.  My legislative\r\n\r\nassistant, who lived in Germany for 16 years, shared with\r\n\r\nme  that  she feels very uneasy each time she  mixes  her\r\n\r\ntrash,   as   in  Germany,  households  sort  trash   for\r\n\r\nrecycling.   In  Singapore, we often find  non-recyclable\r\n\r\ntrash in recycling bins.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students should not only be taught the virtues of\r\n\r\nrecycling   and   brought   to   visit   landfills    and\r\n\r\nincinerators. They should be given ample opportunities to\r\n\r\nput  into  practice  what they learn.  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  the  Ministry that NEA organise  a  national\r\n\r\nrecycling  competition for schools to  promote  recycling\r\n\r\namong our young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection points for recyclable materials could be\r\n\r\nmade even more accessible.  In fact, for every two public\r\n\r\ntrash bins, perhaps there should be one for recycling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, residents could be weaned from using\r\n\r\nplastic  bags  which are environmentally  unfriendly  for\r\n\r\nstoring  recyclable items, with the provision of reusable\r\n\r\ncrates  such  as  those SembWaste  is  using  for  landed\r\n\r\nhousing estates.  In HDB estates, I support the idea that\r\n\r\nthe Government could also look into providing two\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchutes,   one  for  recyclables  and  another  for   non-recyclables.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, NEA has clearly made a very good headstart in\r\n\r\npromoting  recycling.   But  more  needs  to   be   done.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans must learn to treasure trash!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I support Dr Amy\r\n\r\nKhor  in  commending the Ministry of the Environment  for\r\n\r\nthe  efforts and progress that it has  made in  promoting\r\n\r\nrecycling in homes and the achievements made that one  in\r\n\r\nthree households now recycle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concerns are: what is the cost of collection of\r\n\r\nthe  recycled materials from house-to-house per household\r\n\r\nper  month?  What is the value of the recycled  materials\r\n\r\ncollected  per household per month?  What is the  average\r\n\r\nvolume  of  the  recycled materials  versus  the  average\r\n\r\nvolume  of  the refuse per household?

What other alternatives has ENV explored?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, more education programmes should be\r\n\r\nemphasised in the following areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educate the people at home, the young and old, the\r\n\r\nschool  children,  especially  primary  school  children,\r\n\r\nwhere enthusiasm can still be cultivated on recycling and\r\n\r\nwhat can be recycled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most households are familiar with the recycling of\r\n\r\npapers.  Many do not know what are the materials that can\r\n\r\nbe  recycled,  for  example, glass,  aluminium  cans  and\r\n\r\nbottles and at what stage must these materials be cleaned\r\n\r\nbefore they are thrown into the recycling bins.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have some education materials in Tagalog and Bahasa\r\n\r\nIndonesia to enable our maids to recycle too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed that ENV has introduced recycling\r\n\r\nbins  in  some of the public places, for example, Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad,   hawker  centres  and  MRT  stations.

These\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  be  suitable  for  small volumes  of  waste,  most\r\n\r\nprobably  as  a  by-product of the  activities  at  these\r\n\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am suggesting that we designate some areas within\r\n\r\nHDB  estates and private estates where recycling bins are\r\n\r\nthere all the time where the refuse collection contractor\r\n\r\ncollects  daily.  This  could  eventually  be  the   more\r\n\r\nsustainable centres for collection of recycling materials\r\n\r\nin  the  long run and are near to the homes where  larger\r\n\r\nvolumes of recycling materials are available.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, based on the Ministry's\r\n\r\nprojections on its current waste generation and recycling\r\n\r\nrates,  a  new landfill is required once in  every  25-30\r\n\r\nyears. That would mean that our current landfill at Pulau\r\n\r\nSemakau will probably last us till, say, 2030.  From that\r\n\r\npoint  of  view,  this is a deadline  that  is  far  more\r\n\r\nimminent  than  our second Water Agreement with  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwhich  expires in 2061.  It is more critical in the sense\r\n\r\nthat  land  is  not a renewable source  unless  we  count\r\n\r\nreclamation. We really need to address this  issue  in  a\r\n\r\nhurry,  it seems to me, to ensure that landfill  life  is\r\n\r\nextended for as long as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise the question from both the\r\n\r\nsupply  and  demand side. From the supply side,  clearly,\r\n\r\nthis  is not sustainable but it seems to me that we would\r\n\r\nneed plans for at least one or two more landfills for the\r\n\r\nforeseeable future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that I have for the Minister is: what\r\n\r\nare   the  plans  in  that  regard?   But  perhaps,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  on  the  demand side,  many  speakers  have\r\n\r\nalluded  to the point on recycling.  It seems to me  that\r\n\r\nland  is  a  strategic resource and providing  additional\r\n\r\nlandfill  sites  is  going  to be  extremely  costly  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Should we not be involved in a very intensive\r\n\r\nway  in educating Singaporeans on the need to recycle and\r\n\r\ncreating  the  right  incentives  and,  dare  I  say  it,\r\n\r\ndisincentives,  so  that the behaviour  adjusts  to  this\r\n\r\nreality?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, I was in China late last\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear.  China right now is going through a very fast  pace\r\n\r\nof  change - urbanisation and industrialisation.  Some of\r\n\r\nthe  officials  that I met told me that one  of  the  key\r\n\r\nconcerns  they face in China today is that,  as  they  go\r\n\r\nthrough the fast pace of development, how do they  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  environment is protected so that, in  time  to\r\n\r\ncome,  the  environment will continue to be liveable.   I\r\n\r\nasked  them,  \"How do you know? What kind of  performance\r\n\r\nindicators  would  you use so that you know  whether  the\r\n\r\nenvironment is being protected?\"  They replied to  me  in\r\n\r\nChinese.  They said, \"This is our target.  Tian kong  shi\r\n\r\nlan  de.  Yuan di shi lu de.  Liu shui shi qing de.  Kong\r\n\r\nqi  shi tian de.\"  Loosely translated, what he meant  was\r\n\r\nthe  sky  hopefully will remain blue,  the  land  remains\r\n\r\ngreen,  the water pure and clear, and the air will remain\r\n\r\nfresh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, earlier, various MPs, Dr Teo Ho Pin and others,\r\n\r\nasked for an update of the environmental performance.  So\r\n\r\nI  asked my officials at NEA the same questions.  I asked\r\n\r\nmy  officials, \"Tell me, what is the colour of our  sky?\"\r\n\r\nAnd my colleagues in NEA told me, \"Minister, we are okay.\r\n\r\nThe sky is still blue and the air is fresh.\"  I said, \"On\r\n\r\nwhat basis did you come to that conclusion?\"  He said  if\r\n\r\nwe  were to look at the pollutant standards index  (PSI),\r\n\r\nin  fact,  since 1993, on the average, about 70%  of  the\r\n\r\ndays  in Singapore, the PSI is less than 50, which is  in\r\n\r\nthe  good range.  But in the last two years, it has  gone\r\n\r\nup  to more than 80%.  In other words, the number of days\r\n\r\nin  Singapore with PSI within the good range has gone  up\r\n\r\nand  that  includes those days where we were affected  by\r\n\r\nthe  regional haze.  If we were to exclude the period  of\r\n\r\nthe regional haze, in fact, last year, 98% of the days in\r\n\r\nSingapore  were within the PSI.  If not for the  regional\r\n\r\nhaze,  almost every day, we do enjoy good air quality  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to emphasise that this clear air and\r\n\r\nblue sky in Singapore did not happen by chance.  Over the\r\n\r\nyears, we have worked very closely with the industries to\r\n\r\ncontrol  emission from the industries.  In fact,  we  are\r\n\r\nworking very closely\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the industries to promote the use of cleaner fuel as\r\n\r\nwell.   Take, for example, the generation of electricity.\r\n\r\nIn  the  year  2000,  about 19%  of  the  electricity  in\r\n\r\nSingapore was generated using natural gas.  It  has  gone\r\n\r\nup  to  47%  last year, which means almost  half  of  the\r\n\r\nelectricity we use today is generated using natural  gas,\r\n\r\nwhich  is a source of cleaner energy.  At the same  time,\r\n\r\nwe  have  also  stepped up enforcement in monitoring,  in\r\n\r\nterms of vehicle emissions.  In fact, over the years,  we\r\n\r\nhave progressively tightened up on the emission standards\r\n\r\nand,  together with enforcement standards, I am happy  to\r\n\r\ninform the House that the percentage of smoky vehicles in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has declined from 5.8% 10 years  ago  to  0.8%\r\n\r\nlast  year.   So  this combination of  factors,  emission\r\n\r\ncontrol in the industries and vehicular emission, has led\r\n\r\nto a better quality of air in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay asked whether two-stroke\r\n\r\nmotorcycles  are a problem and whether we can  phase  out\r\n\r\ntwo-stroke motorcycles completely.  Sir, firstly, I  want\r\n\r\nto   clarify   that   the  registration   of   two-stroke\r\n\r\nmotorcycles  has  not stopped.  Even today,  anybody  can\r\n\r\nstill  register a two-stroke motorcycle as  long  as  the\r\n\r\nvehicle  satisfies our emission standards.  I agree  with\r\n\r\nProf. Low that the two-stroke motorcycles at times can be\r\n\r\na  problem because the design of the vehicle is such that\r\n\r\nthe  owner needs to mix the lubrication oil together with\r\n\r\nthe  petrol in the engine.  And at times, if you were  to\r\n\r\nadd  too much of the lubrication oil, the motorcycle will\r\n\r\nend  up  emitting white smoke.  But I was told  that  the\r\n\r\nnewer two-stroke motorcycles now come with this automatic\r\n\r\npump  and  this pump will ensure that a correct  dose  of\r\n\r\nlubrication  oil is being added.  I want to inform  Prof.\r\n\r\nLow  that there is no plan at all for us to phase out the\r\n\r\ntwo-stroke  motorcycles because we are not aware  of  any\r\n\r\ncountry in this world that has done so.  As far as ENV is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  as long as any vehicle, whether  it  is  two-stroke  or four-stroke, satisfies our emission standards,\r\n\r\nit should be allowed on the road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the area of weather forecast.\r\n\r\nNone  of  the Members here asked me about the quality  of\r\n\r\nour\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nweather  forecast.  But I thought since  we  are  talking\r\n\r\nabout clean and fresh air, it is useful also to say a few\r\n\r\nwords about the work put in by my colleagues in the  area\r\n\r\nof weather forecasting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember sometime ago, we, including myself,\r\n\r\noften  make fun of our weather forecast.  Why?   Because,\r\n\r\nwithout listening to the weather forecast, you and I know\r\n\r\nthat  the weather forecast will be \"scattered showers  at\r\n\r\nisolated places\".  Obviously, many of us did not find  it\r\n\r\nvery  useful.   But let us be very fair  to  our  Weather\r\n\r\nDepartment  because  it  is very  difficult  to  forecast\r\n\r\nweather in a tropical island where the weather season  is\r\n\r\nshorter and, therefore, it is very difficult for us to be\r\n\r\naccurate.   But  what  the weather forecasting  officials\r\n\r\nhave done is that, since 1997, they have been fully aware\r\n\r\nthat  members of the public do expect a more useful  form\r\n\r\nof weather forecasting. So, in 1997, we divided Singapore\r\n\r\ninto  various  regions.  In 1997, we  started  with  five\r\n\r\nregions  and,  in the year 2000, it had  gone  up  to  19\r\n\r\nregions  and,  at  this moment, they are  working  on  32\r\n\r\nregions.   What this means is that you can  now  actually\r\n\r\nask  for  the  weather  forecast for  a  specific  region\r\n\r\nbecause  the  whole of Singapore is now divided  into  32\r\n\r\nregions.  Depending whether you are in Jurong or Tuas  or\r\n\r\nwherever, you can ask for the weather forecast  which  is\r\n\r\nspecific to that particular location.\r\n\r\n<br>11.30 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more useful is that, instead of giving\r\n\r\na  24-hour  forecast,  which is  quite  general  and  not\r\n\r\nspecific  enough,  we are increasingly moving  towards  a\r\n\r\nthree-hour  forecast, what we call \"now-cast\".   So  far,\r\n\r\nbased  on the reaction from the public, it is clear  that\r\n\r\nmost  of  the  public find this \"now-cast\" concept  quite\r\n\r\nuseful.  For example, businesses are coming to us to  ask\r\n\r\nfor  weather  forecasts for specific  areas  of  business\r\n\r\noperations.   For  recreation, there are  times  you  may\r\n\r\norganise outdoor functions at West Coast Park, East Coast\r\n\r\nPark,  and so on.  In fact, we are getting more inquiries\r\n\r\nregarding   the  weather  forecast  for  that  particular\r\n\r\nlocation for the next three hours.  Schools,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor example, are coming to us to ask for lightning watch,\r\n\r\nand  so on.  In fact, last year, about 330,000 hits  were\r\n\r\nrecorded  on  our  Internet  homepage  and  2.1   million\r\n\r\nSingaporeans actually accessed our hotline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are doing now is to work closely with the\r\n\r\nmedia  to ensure that this improvement in the quality  of\r\n\r\nforecast  will  lead to improvement  in  the  quality  of\r\n\r\nbroadcast.   There  is  no point having  all  these  good\r\n\r\nforecasts  if  the information is not being broadcast  to\r\n\r\nthe public.  So if you were to pay attention to our TV  5\r\n\r\nNews,  for  example,  you will notice  that  the  weather\r\n\r\nforecast  today - and it has been going on for  the  last\r\n\r\nfew  weeks  at  least  -  is  a graphical  representation\r\n\r\nshowing  the  weather forecast in the morning,  afternoon\r\n\r\nand  evening.  So the forecast is now more specific.   If\r\n\r\nyou  look  at  today's Lianhe Zaobao, again  the  weather\r\n\r\nforecast is represented in nice graphics, indicating  the\r\n\r\nweather forecast for the different times of the day.   If\r\n\r\nyou  listen  to  our  radio, you will  also  notice  that\r\n\r\nnowadays they will give you the weather forecast at about\r\n\r\n16-17 times a day, and updated based on the latest 3-hour\r\n\r\nforecast.   We  hope  that by working  closely  with  the\r\n\r\nmedia,  we will be able to provide better and more useful\r\n\r\nweather forecasts for members of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the area of land. I asked my\r\n\r\ncolleagues what is the colour of our land and  they  told\r\n\r\nme,  \"Minister,  yes, it is still green and  clean.\"   In\r\n\r\nfact, in year 2001, the STB conducted a survey among  the\r\n\r\nvisitors  to  Singapore and 99% of  them  actually  rated\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a clean city.  PERC did a survey last  year\r\n\r\nfor  the  expatriates.  Again, they highlighted that  the\r\n\r\ncleanliness  of  Singapore is one of the top  three  most\r\n\r\nattractive features of Singapore.  Sir, the reason why we\r\n\r\nare  able  to  continue to maintain a  high  standard  of\r\n\r\ncleanliness in Singapore for public places is because ENV\r\n\r\nand  NEA will never stop looking for new and better  ways\r\n\r\nof keeping Singapore clean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four years ago, we opened up public cleansing for\r\n\r\ncompetition  by the private sector.  Today, we  have  two\r\n\r\ncompanies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncleaning  the highways and roads, and they  make  use  of\r\n\r\nvery  advanced equipment and machinery.  They train their\r\n\r\nworkers so that they can make use of this machinery in  a\r\n\r\nmost  effective and productive manner.  For example,  one\r\n\r\nof  the two companies, Onix, actually makes use of GPS to\r\n\r\ntrack  the movement of their road-sweepers.  At any point\r\n\r\nin  time, the supervisor sitting in the control room will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  look  at  the map and  indicate  the  exact\r\n\r\nlocation  of these mechanical sweepers.  He is even  able\r\n\r\nto  tell  whether  the  sweepers were  just  cruising  or\r\n\r\nactually  sweeping because all the information  is  being\r\n\r\ntransmitted.  This is very important because  it  enables\r\n\r\nthem  to  make  sure that areas that are supposed  to  be\r\n\r\ncleaned  at a certain time of the day are actually  being\r\n\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of NEA, our officers likewise make use\r\n\r\nof  IT.  In fact, we have this Mobile Investigation  Team\r\n\r\n(MIT)  and  they are all equipped with PDAs.   Using  the\r\n\r\nPDAs,  they  are  now able to download  any  comments  or\r\n\r\nfeedback from the public channelled from our call centre.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, right at this moment, every day, we are able to\r\n\r\nrespond  to  at least two out of three calls  within  the\r\n\r\nsame  day.   Sir, as a result, the number  of  complaints\r\n\r\nregarding  the  cleanliness of Singapore has  dropped  by\r\n\r\nabout 30%.  Sir, my message here is that, on the part  of\r\n\r\nNEA  and ENV, we will continue to work very closely  with\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector  to make sure  that  Singapore  will\r\n\r\nremain clean and green.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what about water? Water, obviously is clean\r\n\r\nand  clear  from  the  tap  that  you  have  and  in  the\r\n\r\nreservoirs.   But,  more  importantly,  I  also  want  to\r\n\r\nhighlight that even the amount of \"brown\" water  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  in  Singapore  has declined.   I  am  referring  to\r\n\r\nfloods.   In 1992, about 10 years ago, we had  about  335\r\n\r\nhectares  of  flood-prone areas in Singapore.   Over  the\r\n\r\nlast  ten  years, we have been able to reduce the  flood-prone areas by 50% to 172 hectares today.  And, over  the\r\n\r\nnext five years, we intend to further reduce the areas by\r\n\r\none  third to 110 hectares.  In fact, Members will notice\r\n\r\nthat, in the last three\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears,  there was not a single case of a major  flood  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   There was no flood that was  more  than  0.5\r\n\r\nmetre deep with a duration of more than one hour and with\r\n\r\na  flooded area of one hectare, which is about 1.5  times\r\n\r\nthe  size of a football field.  Even minor floods,  which\r\n\r\nare  less  than 0.3 metre and short duration,  have  also\r\n\r\ncome down from 10 in 2000 to 7 last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have talked about the colour of the sky, the\r\n\r\nair,  land, and so on.  My officers then reminded me that\r\n\r\nthere  is one colour I have not asked.  I said, \"What  is\r\n\r\nthat?\"  They said, \"You should ask us about the colour of\r\n\r\nour  public health.\"  I said, \"Very good.  So what is the\r\n\r\ncolour of our public health?\"  They said, \"The colour  is\r\n\r\npink.\"   I  asked  them, \"How can you tell  me  that  the\r\n\r\ncolour of our public health is pink when I know for  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the number of dengue cases last year has gone  up?\"\r\n\r\nThey told me that the number of dengue cases has gone  up\r\n\r\nfrom 2,370 the year before to almost 4,000 last year,  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of 66%, and I said, \"Look, with a 66%  increase\r\n\r\nin  dengue  cases, I refuse to accept that the colour  of\r\n\r\nour  public health is pink.\"  They asked me to listen  to\r\n\r\ntheir explanation.  Having listened to their explanation,\r\n\r\nI  agreed  with  them that they were  right.   Sir,  what\r\n\r\nhappened was this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, there was a world-wide resurgence of\r\n\r\ndengue.  In fact, if you look at several countries in our\r\n\r\nregion,  for example, in Thailand, the number  of  dengue\r\n\r\ncases  went up by 650%.  In Cambodia, it went up by 250%.\r\n\r\nIn  Laos,  131%.  In Malaysia, there were 54 deaths.   In\r\n\r\nThailand,  there were 171 cases of death.  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nNEA  anticipated this resurgence last year and in 2001  - they  did not wait till 2002 to take action - before  the\r\n\r\nresurgence   took  place,  they  stepped  up   preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures.  NEA worked with the pest control companies  to\r\n\r\nintensify ground surveillance.  NEA officers visited more\r\n\r\nthan 48,000 landed properties to advise the homeowners to\r\n\r\ntake  measures to prevent mosquito breeding.  At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  they  conducted systematic checks  on  the  school\r\n\r\ncompounds.  We even conducted roving exhibitions for  the\r\n\r\nvarious construction sites.  So, because of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  combination of efforts by the private  sector,  the\r\n\r\npeople  sector and NEA, even though we could  not  escape\r\n\r\nthe  world-wide increase in dengue, at least, we did well\r\n\r\nin  minimising the impact and we were able  to  keep  the\r\n\r\nsituation under control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on the whole, I would say that we have done well\r\n\r\nin terms of the environmental performance.  We see a blue\r\n\r\nsky,  green land, fresh air, clear water and pink health.\r\n\r\nI guess the next set of questions asked by the Members of\r\n\r\nParliament,  is  how  long  can  the  current  state   of\r\n\r\nenvironment continue.  In short, is our environment today\r\n\r\nmore  sustainable than before?  Sir, here I am  happy  to\r\n\r\nsay that our assessment is, yes.  Indeed, the environment\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  has  become more sustainable.   Take,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  area of water supply, as mentioned  by  Mr\r\n\r\nZainul.   The  global  community is today  attending  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Water Forum in Japan.  The concern of  the  global\r\n\r\ncommunity is that by the year 2025, which is not far from\r\n\r\nnow,  at least two-thirds of the world's population  will\r\n\r\nbe faced with water shortage.  So sustainability of water\r\n\r\nsupply is now a global concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, if you had watched BBC\r\n\r\nWorld  yesterday, it was reported that Singapore  is  the\r\n\r\npoorest  country in the Asia-Pacific in  terms  of  water\r\n\r\navailability per capita, meaning that the availability of\r\n\r\nwater per capita, in terms of national resources, we  are\r\n\r\nthe  worst in the Asia-Pacific.  And, if you look at  the\r\n\r\nglobal  picture, how can we solve this  problem?   If  we\r\n\r\nwere  to keep on looking for solutions to increase  water\r\n\r\nsupply world-wide by 20-30%, I do not think we are  going\r\n\r\nto  go too far.  What this world needs is an approach  to\r\n\r\nthe solution that is able to increase water supply by 200-300%,  if  we  want  to  be able to overcome  this  water\r\n\r\nchallenge on a world-wide basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how can that be done? How can we create a\r\n\r\nquantum  leap in the water capacity?  The answer is  very\r\n\r\nsimple.  Firstly, we must all look for new ways to add to\r\n\r\nnew sources of supply and, at the same time, find ways to\r\n\r\nmultiply every\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrop  so that every drop becomes two drops or even  more.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, this is exactly what we are doing in Singapore.\r\n\r\nOver the years we have added new sources of supply to our\r\n\r\nsupply  system.   So the PUB has awarded  a  desalination\r\n\r\ntender.    By   2005,  the  plant  would   be   producing\r\n\r\ndesalinated water.  PUB is expanding our local  catchment\r\n\r\nareas to add to the supply locally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, last year, we have succeeded in\r\n\r\nputting  in place a system to multiply the water  sources\r\n\r\nin Singapore through the construction and installation of\r\n\r\nNEWater  plants.  Right now, two NEWater  plants  are  in\r\n\r\noperation at Bedok and Kranji.  The third plant is  under\r\n\r\nconstruction  in  Seletar and the fourth  plant  will  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  at  Ulu Pandan.  So together they will produce  55\r\n\r\nmillion  gallons  of NEWater per day.   At  this  moment,\r\n\r\nevery  day  we  supply  about 2 million  gallons  to  the\r\n\r\nreservoirs  and, at the same time, we supply  NEWater  to\r\n\r\nthe  wafer  fab  park,  as well  as  to  some  commercial\r\n\r\nbuildings for the cooling of the air-conditioned  towers.\r\n\r\nIn fact, for every drop of water today that we channel to\r\n\r\nthe   reservoirs,  there  are  another  3.5  drops  being\r\n\r\nsupplied to the industry and commercial buildings for non-potable use.  So, we are actually making good use of  the\r\n\r\nNEWater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul asked whether we have any plans to make\r\n\r\nmore  use of NEWater.  Sir, the intention is that by  the\r\n\r\ntime  when  the Ulu Pandan plant is ready, we would  have\r\n\r\nfour NEWater plants at four different parts of Singapore.\r\n\r\nEach  of  these plants will have a separate  reticulation\r\n\r\nsystem,  bringing  the NEWater to the industrial  estates\r\n\r\nand  commercial  heart within that area,  so  that,  over\r\n\r\ntime, as much of the non-potable use of water as possible\r\n\r\nwould  be  met through NEWater.  In this way we  will  be\r\n\r\nable to free up more PUB water for domestic use.  Sir, by\r\n\r\nthe year 2005, as I mentioned, we will have four national\r\n\r\ntaps  - desalination, NEWater, local catchment and  water\r\n\r\nfrom Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul asked whether we are working on other\r\n\r\nsources  of  supply.  Obviously, PUB would  not  stop  at\r\n\r\nthese four sources.  We will continue to monitor advances\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnology  and, at the right time, we will  set  up  new\r\n\r\ndemonstration  plants like what we  did  years  ago  with\r\n\r\nNEWater and, at the right time, going into the fifth tap.\r\n\r\nAt  this moment, I am not able to give any indication  on\r\n\r\nwhen  will it happen because, at the end of the  day,  we\r\n\r\nwant  to make sure that the technology is able to produce\r\n\r\nthe  quality of water that we need and, more importantly,\r\n\r\nat a price that is cost competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, various Members asked about the affordability\r\n\r\nof  supply.   Mr  Low  Thia Khiang asked  whether  it  is\r\n\r\npossible  for the PUB to lower the water tariff  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  benefits of these new sources can be shared with the\r\n\r\npublic.   Prof. Low Seow Chay asked whether PUB  can  fix\r\n\r\nthe  price  of  water  at what it  is  today,  until  the\r\n\r\nexpiration of the 1961 Water Agreement in 2011.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me explain very clearly the situation.\r\n\r\nMembers  of the House are fully aware that NEWater  today\r\n\r\nhas  a  new home, the NEWater Visitor Centre.  There  are\r\n\r\nabout  2,000  visitors  every week visiting  the  NEWater\r\n\r\nVisitor  Centre trying to learn more about NEWater.   The\r\n\r\nother  day when I talked to Mr NEWater, he was not  in  a\r\n\r\nvery good mood.  In fact, he was a bit down.  I asked him\r\n\r\nwhy.   I said, \"Look, you should be in a very happy  mood\r\n\r\nnow  that you have so many visitors trying to learn  more\r\n\r\nabout  you at your new home.\"  He said, \"Yes, I  am  very\r\n\r\nhappy,  but  from time to time I feel that  I  have  been\r\n\r\nmisunderstood.\"    I  said,  \"In   what   way   are   you\r\n\r\nmisunderstood?\"   He  said,  \"I  think   about   90%   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are very happy with me.  They accepted  the\r\n\r\nfact  that I am clean, I am pure and I am safe to  drink.\r\n\r\nI  have  no problem with that.  But from time to time,  I\r\n\r\nhave problems with Members of Parliament like Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang  and  Prof.  Low Seow Chay, who  complained,  that\r\n\r\nbecause  of me, the price of PUB water will go up.   That\r\n\r\ngets me very upset.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, \"That is a very good point. I am going to\r\n\r\nParliament  today, what would you want me  to  convey  to\r\n\r\nthem on your behalf?\"  He said, \"Mr Lim, please\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntell them that if not for NEWater, Singaporeans will have\r\n\r\nto  pay  even  more for the water that they are  drinking\r\n\r\ntoday.\"   I said, \"Why?  How do I convey that to Mr  Low,\r\n\r\nfor  example?\"   He said, \"You tell Mr Low,  if  not  for\r\n\r\nNEWater, Singapore may have no choice but to find ways to\r\n\r\nextend the 1961 Water Agreement because, without NEWater,\r\n\r\nwe   will  not  be  able  to  find  other  cost-effective\r\n\r\nsolutions  to reduce our dependency on Malaysia.   If  we\r\n\r\nwere to agree to the demands by the Malaysians - remember\r\n\r\nthey asked to increase the price of raw water to RM3  per\r\n\r\n1,000  gallons  - please tell Mr Low that RM3  per  1,000\r\n\r\ngallons would translate to 30 cents per cubic metre.   In\r\n\r\nother  words,  if not for NEWater, if we  are  forced  to\r\n\r\nagree to the demands by the Malaysian Government and sign\r\n\r\nthat  new  water agreement starting from 2011, and  start\r\n\r\npaying  RM3  per 1,000 gallons starting from  today,  the\r\n\r\ndate  of  the  agreement, the cost of water in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  go up by 30 cents per cubic metre.\"  And Mr NEWater\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"That is not all, because the Malaysians  did  not\r\n\r\nstop  at RM3 per 1,000 gallons.  Do not forget that their\r\n\r\ndemand  went up to RM6.25 per 1,000 gallons, and this  is\r\n\r\ntranslated  to  62  1/2 cents per  cubic  metre.   Please\r\n\r\nexplain this very clearly to Mr Low Thia Khiang and Prof.\r\n\r\nLow  Seow Chay that because of me, NEWater, you  are  now\r\n\r\nable  to  avoid the need to pay another 62 1/2 cents  per\r\n\r\ncubic metre, just for raw water coming from Malaysia.\"\r\n\r\n<br>11.45 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think Mr NEWater has a very good point,\r\n\r\nbecause the point is that the introduction of NEWater has\r\n\r\nnow  reduced  the need for the PUB and the Government  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the price of water.  As a result,  we  are  now\r\n\r\nable  to stretch for as long as we can and keep the price\r\n\r\nof water at the current level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay asked whether the PUB can assure\r\n\r\nthe  public  to keep the present tariff up  to  the  year\r\n\r\n2011,  meaning no change in the water tariff up to  2011.\r\n\r\nMy response to Prof. Low Seow Chay is, yes, we can assure\r\n\r\nthe  public that there will be no increase in  the  water\r\n\r\ntariff for the next 10 years if Prof. Low Seow Chay\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  promise  us  that, over the next 10 years,  firstly,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  no  increase in water demand;  secondly,\r\n\r\nthere will be no inflation; and, thirdly, post-2011,  the\r\n\r\nwater  demand  in Singapore will remain at  where  it  is\r\n\r\ntoday.   And without asking Prof. Low Seow Chay,  I  know\r\n\r\nthat  his answers to my three questions will be,  no,  no\r\n\r\nand  no.  Because water demand in Singapore continues  to\r\n\r\ngo  up.  It has to be.  The population continues to grow;\r\n\r\neconomic  activities continue to expand, so water  demand\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  go up.  As long as  water  demand  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  continues  to  increase,  the  PUB   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  have  to  undertake  the  challenge  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to source for additional supply, whether through\r\n\r\nadding new supply or multiplying existing supply.  And it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  matter where the additional sources of  supply\r\n\r\nare  coming  from.  It does not matter  where  they  come\r\n\r\nfrom.   One thing for sure is that all future sources  of\r\n\r\nsupply will be more expensive than the existing source of\r\n\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very easy to understand. Just imagine that we\r\n\r\nhave  a  tree.  This tree bears fruits every day,  except\r\n\r\nthat the fruit is in the form of water, because this is a\r\n\r\nwater  tree.  And what has happened over the  last  30-40\r\n\r\nyears, we have been using all the low-lying fruits  every\r\n\r\nday.   Every morning, we go to this tree.  We just  reach\r\n\r\nout  to the tree, pluck the fruits and we drink the water\r\n\r\nin the fruits.  We have been doing this every day, and we\r\n\r\nwill continue to do it for the next 30-50 years.  But the\r\n\r\nproblem  is  that  all  the low-lying  fruits  have  been\r\n\r\nplucked  every  day,  and it is not enough  to  meet  our\r\n\r\nincreased  demand in the future.  So what do we  have  to\r\n\r\ndo?   We have to reach out for the fruits that are higher\r\n\r\nup.   To  reach out for those fruits higher up,  we  need\r\n\r\nmore  effort.  We have got to take out the  ladder.   The\r\n\r\nsame  thing  applies  to  water supply.   For  the  local\r\n\r\ncatchment  water that we talk about - Marina Barrage  and\r\n\r\nthe  Lower Seletar Water Scheme - in fact, the filtration\r\n\r\nmethod that will be deployed for this new scheme will  no\r\n\r\nlonger be the traditional approach, but membrane will  be\r\n\r\nused, because we want to assure the quality.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware of the cost of desalinated water,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  more expensive than what we have today.   Even\r\n\r\nwater from Malaysia.  Some Members have suggested why not\r\n\r\nwe  go  back  to Malaysia and talk about more water  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   Again, please do not forget  the  last  offer\r\n\r\nfrom Malaysia for treated water.  It worked out to RM10.5\r\n\r\nper  1,000  gallons, which is $1.05 per cubic metre.   At\r\n\r\n$1.05, the treated water from Malaysia in the future,  as\r\n\r\ndemanded by them, will be as expensive, if not more  than\r\n\r\ndesalinated water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that while I share the concerns of the\r\n\r\nMembers that we have to keep the cost of water affordable\r\n\r\nto  Singaporeans, I suggest to Members of the House that,\r\n\r\nlet us not mislead the members of the public.  If we give\r\n\r\nSingaporeans the impression that it is possible for us to\r\n\r\nlower  the cost of water in the future, then I  think  we\r\n\r\nare  being  irresponsible.  Because if  we  look  at  all\r\n\r\npossible  avenues  in the future, there  is  no  way  any\r\n\r\ncountry,  Singapore included, can find a  lower  cost  of\r\n\r\nwater  supply in the future.  Does it then mean  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  keep  on paying more and more for  water?   The\r\n\r\nanswer is no.  Sir, the answer is no because the real key\r\n\r\nto  our  solution in keeping water prices  low  is  water\r\n\r\nconservation.  We can try to use less water,  because  if\r\n\r\nevery one of us here can use less water, then we need  to\r\n\r\nadd  less  water  in the future, and thereby  reduce  the\r\n\r\noverall cost of water supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, let me respond to the question from\r\n\r\nMr  Zainul  Abidin.  He wanted to know who are the  worst\r\n\r\nwater  wasters in Singapore today.  I am happy to  inform\r\n\r\nMr  Zainul that on a per capita basis, Singaporeans today\r\n\r\nconsume about 165 litres of water every day, and  it  has\r\n\r\nstabilised  over the last five years.  In  fact,  at  165\r\n\r\nlitres per day, the water consumption in Singapore  on  a\r\n\r\nper capita basis is one of the lowest among the cities of\r\n\r\ncomparable  density.  In fact, if we  look  at  household\r\n\r\nconsumption, among the households that consume more  than\r\n\r\n40  cubic metres per month, the percentage has come  down\r\n\r\nfrom  10% 10 years ago to about 6% today.  What  is  even\r\n\r\nmore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nencouraging  is  that among the households  that  consume\r\n\r\nless  than  20  cubic metres per month, it has  increased\r\n\r\nfrom 56% 10 years ago to 65%.  In other words, two out of\r\n\r\nevery  three  households in Singapore today consume  less\r\n\r\nthan  20 cubic metres of water every month.  I think this\r\n\r\nis a very good sign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, in the industries. In fact, many of our\r\n\r\ncompanies  promote recycling.  Take, for  example,  wafer\r\n\r\nfab  plants.   The recycling rate has now  exceeded  50%.\r\n\r\nAnd  for  all  commercial premises, PUB does require  the\r\n\r\nmandatory installation of water saving devices.   On  the\r\n\r\nwhole,  I  think we are conserving, and I  do  not  think\r\n\r\nthere is any major waster, so to speak, in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman asked what is our target in water\r\n\r\nconservation.   Sir, the target of PUB  is  to  keep  the\r\n\r\nwater consumption per capita at 165 litres per person per\r\n\r\nday, meaning that as we continue our economic growth  and\r\n\r\nsocial upgrading, we hope that water consumption will not\r\n\r\nincrease on a per capita basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul asked whether the methods that we are\r\n\r\nusing  today - thimbles and so on - have been  effective.\r\n\r\nI  am  happy  to  say  that the PUB  launched  the  water\r\n\r\nefficient homes in February, just last month, at the Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  constituency.  About 3,000 households in 31 blocks\r\n\r\nwere  given bags and thimbles.  Later on, after a survey,\r\n\r\nwe  found that about one-third of them actually installed\r\n\r\nthose  water saving devices that were given to  them.   I\r\n\r\nthink this is a very good sign.  PUB's plan is that  over\r\n\r\nthe   next  15  months,  it  will  be  working  with   23\r\n\r\nconstituencies  to reach out to 100,000  homes  in  1,000\r\n\r\nblocks,  and these are mainly the older HDB blocks.   Our\r\n\r\nobjective is to help the households, through these  water\r\n\r\nsaving  devices,  to  reduce their water  consumption  by\r\n\r\nabout  5-8% per month.  We think this is doable,  and  we\r\n\r\nhope  that water conservation, over time, will  become  a\r\n\r\nway of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman asked whether ENV will consider a separate\r\n\r\nsupply system for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouseholds  for  non-potable  use.   The  answer  is  no,\r\n\r\nbecause we find that it is not cost effective to  do  so.\r\n\r\nAnd  as I have mentioned earlier, most of the NEWater  is\r\n\r\nchannelled  to  the  industries  and  to  the  commercial\r\n\r\nbuildings  for  non-potable use.  There is  therefore  no\r\n\r\nneed  and  it is not cost effective to set up a  separate\r\n\r\nsystem for the households.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on water, let me conclude by saying that on the\r\n\r\nsupply side, we have succeeded in closing the water loop.\r\n\r\nOn  the  demand  side, our challenge  now  is  to  reduce\r\n\r\nwastage  and to encourage more conservation.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  by  working  together, Singapore will  have  enough\r\n\r\nwater  at affordable prices for a long time to come,  and\r\n\r\nwe have to work together to make sure that Singapore will\r\n\r\nforever be on the right side of the global water divide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on quickly to the area of solid\r\n\r\nwaste  management.  Mr Iswaran asked whether the landfill\r\n\r\nsite  at  Pulau Semakau at this moment can  last  for  25\r\n\r\nyears.   He  also asked what will happen  post-2030.   Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran's concern is a valid one.  Because, in the  past,\r\n\r\nour  plan was to build a new incineration plant every 5-7\r\n\r\nyears  and  find a new landfill site the  size  of  Pulau\r\n\r\nSemakau,  which is as large as Sentosa island,  every  25\r\n\r\nyears.    Then we came to the conclusion that it  is  not\r\n\r\nsustainable.  And that is the reason why, as mentioned by\r\n\r\nMdm   Cynthia  Phua,  we  are  now  moving  towards  zero\r\n\r\nlandfill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked what were the achievements so\r\n\r\nfar.  Dr Amy Khor also asked whether the target we set in\r\n\r\nthe  national  recycling programmes is realistic.   I  am\r\n\r\nhappy  to  say that at the national level, in  fact,  the\r\n\r\nlevels  of  recycling is on the rise from 40% about  five\r\n\r\nyears  ago to 45% last year, and we are now on  track  to\r\n\r\nachieve 60% by 2012.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key objectives under the recycling\r\n\r\nprogramme is to promote recycling in the HDB estates  and\r\n\r\nin  the  private estates.  So far, we have been  able  to\r\n\r\nachieve the target of one in three households taking part\r\n\r\nin recycling at the end of last year.  Our target, as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmentioned  by Dr Amy Khor, for this year, is to  increase\r\n\r\nthe  participation rate to one out of  every  two.   What\r\n\r\nthis  means is that we have to move from the coverage  of\r\n\r\nservice  to the quality of service, ie, making sure  that\r\n\r\nthe  recycling  system will become more  effective,  more\r\n\r\nconvenient, to members of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we continue in our programmes, one of our future\r\n\r\nthrusts  would be the condominiums as well.   So far,  we\r\n\r\ntalk  about HDB estates and private estates.  Right  now,\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, there are about 1,500 condominiums.  I  am\r\n\r\nhappy to say that from April last year, only one in 25 of\r\n\r\nthese  condominiums took part in recycling.  But  at  the\r\n\r\nend of last year, it has gone up to one in seven, and our\r\n\r\ntarget for this year is to go up to one in four.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we are also increasing the setting\r\n\r\nup  of recycling at public places.  Dr Amy Khor suggested\r\n\r\nthat  we should have one recycling bin to two trash  bags\r\n\r\nat  public places.  I am not sure whether that is doable.\r\n\r\nBut  I am happy to share with Dr Amy Khor that the number\r\n\r\nof  recycling  bins  at public places  has  been  on  the\r\n\r\nincrease.   In  fact, in the year 2001, we had  1,700  of\r\n\r\nthem.   Last  year, it went up to 3,800.  And our  target\r\n\r\nthis year is to go up to 4,500, ie, a three-fold increase\r\n\r\nover  a  period of two years.  If need be, and if  it  is\r\n\r\nviable,  we  will  try  to move  towards  the  target  as\r\n\r\nproposed by Dr Amy Khor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my conclusion here is that because of these\r\n\r\nvarious  recycling  programmes,  we  have  extended   the\r\n\r\nlifespan of Pulau Semakau from 25 years to more  than  30\r\n\r\nyears  now.   In fact, our assessment at this  moment  is\r\n\r\nthat  Pulau Semakau can now last for 35 years because  of\r\n\r\nthe  reduction  in waste and the increase  in  recycling.\r\n\r\nBut  we are not going to stop here.  Even 35 years in our\r\n\r\nview  is not good enough.  Our target is to increase  the\r\n\r\nnational recycling rate to 60%, so that Pulau Semakau, in\r\n\r\nits  current  form, can be stretched to 50  years  rather\r\n\r\nthan  35  years.   What we have to  do  is  to,  firstly,\r\n\r\ncontinue   to  reduce  the  amount  of  waste  going   to\r\n\r\nincineration  plants; secondly, continue  to  reduce  the\r\n\r\namount  of  incineration bottom ash going  to  landfills;\r\n\r\nand, lastly, divert away those\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwastes which are going directly into the landfill site.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua asked whether the system today is\r\n\r\ncost  effective  and sustainable.  Dr Amy Khor  suggested\r\n\r\nwhy do we not have separate chutes for the HDB blocks  so\r\n\r\nthat we do not have to do door-to-door collections and so\r\n\r\non.  I agree fully with the view expressed by Mdm Cynthia\r\n\r\nPhua  and Dr Amy Khor.  The door-to-door collection  does\r\n\r\nprovide  a convenient service for members of the  public,\r\n\r\nbut  the cost of collection is high, because it is labour\r\n\r\nintensive.   So, in the NEA, in fact, we  are  now  in  a\r\n\r\ndiscussion  with  the HDB to explore the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nhaving  a separate chute for recyclable wastes along  the\r\n\r\ncorridors  of some of the HDB flats.  When will  this  be\r\n\r\ndone?  Once we have sorted out the details, I am sure HDB\r\n\r\nand NEA will provide more details when they are ready  to\r\n\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n12.00 noon\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me, in conclusion, come back to the most\r\n\r\nimportant question, which is asked by Mr Iswaran, ie,  at\r\n\r\nthe  rate we are going, whether we are going to have  one\r\n\r\nor  two more landfill sites, and where are these landfill\r\n\r\nsites.  Will Singapore run out of landfill sites by 2030?\r\n\r\nLet  me  assure  him  that this will  not  be  the  case.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  as I mentioned, we have now extended the  life-span  of  Pulau  Semakau,  through  recycling  and  waste\r\n\r\nminimisation, to 35 years. And we intend to continue  our\r\n\r\nefforts  so  that  its life-span can be  extended  to  50\r\n\r\nyears.   Secondly, Pulau Semakau still has got  room  for\r\n\r\nfurther expansion.  In fact, Phase 2 of Pulau Semakau  is\r\n\r\nas  big  as Phase 1 of Pulau Semakau.  If we are able  to\r\n\r\nextend  the life-span of Phase 1 of Pulau Semakau  to  50\r\n\r\nyears,  then, together with Phase 2 of Pulau Semakau,  we\r\n\r\nwould have a landfill site available for Singapore's  use\r\n\r\nfor  the  next  100 years.  And if we succeed  in  moving\r\n\r\ntowards  zero  landfill, in fact, the day may  come  when\r\n\r\nPulau Semakau (Phase 2) will become unnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I have your permission to\r\n\r\nseek a clarification from the Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clarification, yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether he would clarify with Mr NEWater that it\r\n\r\nis  not  Miss Raw Water whom we have to pay  a  dowry  to\r\n\r\nmarry.   That  is, would he tell us what is  exactly  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  producing NEWater per cubic metre,  bearing  in\r\n\r\nmind that you do not pay for the cost of raw water?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about\r\n\r\nMr NEWater and Miss Raw Water.

What we said  earlier  was\r\n\r\nthat, if not for NEWater, we would have to pay another 30\r\n\r\ncents  per  cubic  metre and another 62 cents  per  cubic\r\n\r\nmetre  for raw water.  All these would translate directly\r\n\r\ninto the cost of treated water.  So the comparison that I\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier was a direct comparison.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Low Thia Khiang said that, in the case\r\n\r\nof NEWater, because we do not charge for the input water,\r\n\r\nthe secondary effluence, we are able to keep the cost  of\r\n\r\nNEWater  low.  Sir, I am not too sure what  Mr  Low  Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang  is  suggesting.  Is Mr Low Thia Khiang suggesting\r\n\r\nthat we should cost the secondary effluence, add them  to\r\n\r\nthe  cost of NEWater, jack up the cost of NEWater so that\r\n\r\nwe could increase the price of PUB water?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, would he allow me to\r\n\r\nclarify  my  point?  My point is that for treated  water,\r\n\r\nright now, you have got to pay for the cost of raw water,\r\n\r\nwhich is from Malaysia.  There is a treatment cost.   But\r\n\r\nas  for NEWater, the water input is from the sewers.   So\r\n\r\nyou  do not pay for the additional cost of raw water  but\r\n\r\nyou pay only for the treatment cost of the water.  So you\r\n\r\nminus away that part on the input cost of the raw water.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Low for his\r\n\r\nclarification.  Mr Low should spend some time to  go  and\r\n\r\ntake  a  look at the NEWater Visitor Centre.  If  Mr  Low\r\n\r\nwere  to  visit the NEWater Visitor Centre, he would  see\r\n\r\nthat  next to it, the new water plant, there is  a  water\r\n\r\ntreatment  work,  what we call water  reclamation  plant.\r\n\r\nThe  sewer water that Mr Low talked about, which is free,\r\n\r\nis  now  being processed by the water reclamation  plant.\r\n\r\nSo,  it  does cost money to treat the sewer  water  to  a\r\n\r\nstandard  of what we call the secondary effluence.   This\r\n\r\nsecondary effluence is then used as an input for NEWater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when we talk about the cost of NEWater today, Mr\r\n\r\nLow  is correct that we have not included the cost of the\r\n\r\nsecondary  effluence, for a simple reason.   Today,  this\r\n\r\nsecondary effluence is also being produced.  We treat the\r\n\r\nsewer  water into secondary effluence before we discharge\r\n\r\nthem  into  the open seas.  In other words,  we  are  not\r\n\r\nturning  something which we throw away every day  to  the\r\n\r\nsea into a useful product, which is NEWater.  And that is\r\n\r\nthe reason why we are able not to include the cost of the\r\n\r\nsecondary  effluence,  because it  is  already  happening\r\n\r\ntoday, ie, it is already being wasted today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a bit complicated for me to try to\r\n\r\nexplain the whole water treatment process.

Dr Teo Ho Pin.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, there is a lack of legislation\r\n\r\nto  regulate energy conservation in Singapore.   While  I\r\n\r\ncan  understand the Government's approach to adopt  self-regulation,  the poor energy efficiency of buildings  and\r\n\r\nenergy   consumption  appliances,  and  the   high-energy\r\n\r\nwastage  experienced in Singapore clearly show  that  our\r\n\r\nenergy   conservation  efforts   are   not   making   any\r\n\r\nsignificant progress.  In Japan, energy conservation laws\r\n\r\nare  implemented  in three key areas, namely,  factories,\r\n\r\nbuildings  and equipment.  There are many laws, policies,\r\n\r\nguidelines  and energy conservation measures  adopted  to\r\n\r\nprovide a holistic approach to energy conservation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, our commitment to energy\r\n\r\nconservation  is  still  not very  high.   We  have  only\r\n\r\nmanaged  to form an Energy Efficiency Committee  and  not\r\n\r\nmany  key programmes are implemented to conserve  energy.\r\n\r\nWe  need to develop an energy conservation culture  among\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  consumers and the authorities in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs  energy prices are likely to continue to rise, we must\r\n\r\nconserve and explore alternative sources of energy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the key policies and strategies to\r\n\r\nencourage energy conservation in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Will the Ministry consider legislating an\r\n\r\nenergy conservation law?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) How can we encourage developers, building\r\n\r\nconsultants    and   contractors   to    build    \"energy\r\n\r\nconservation\" buildings?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) What are the measures or incentives taken to\r\n\r\nencourage   energy   conservation  by  building   owners,\r\n\r\nbusinessmen and consumers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, energy efficiency is a\r\n\r\ndifficult  term  to understand.  I will quote  some  more\r\n\r\nother   terms  under  energy  conservation,  ie,   energy\r\n\r\nmanagement, energy audit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consumer, Sir, I would like the National\r\n\r\nEnvironment Agency to look into defining the term \"energy\r\n\r\nefficiency\"  in  the various electrical  appliances  with\r\n\r\nquantifiable indicators, so that simple consumers like me\r\n\r\nwill understand and participate in energy conservation  - again, a very long word.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, many do not understand what \"one green\r\n\r\ntick\" means in the energy labelling system.  I understand\r\n\r\nfrom  MOS  Dr Balaji that, presently, they are  including\r\n\r\nthe  dollar  amount of electricity consumption  cost  per\r\n\r\nmonth in the energy label for electrical appliances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does this one tick translate into savings\r\n\r\ninstead of cost (which is currently stated on the labels)\r\n\r\nat  the end of the month?  In a normal situation, savings\r\n\r\nwould mean comparing the cost of electricity used for the\r\n\r\nappliance  with that of the average industry  electricity\r\n\r\nconsumption  cost  for  that  type  of  appliance.   When\r\n\r\nconsumers know that they are going to save, they would be\r\n\r\nbetter   convinced   to   buy  a  more   energy-efficient\r\n\r\nappliance.  We could do more to educate our consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present energy labelling scheme has been\r\n\r\ninitiated  on  two electrical products, ie, refrigerators\r\n\r\nand  air-conditioners.  We should extend this  scheme  to\r\n\r\nother   electrical  appliances  quickly,  such  as  water\r\n\r\nheaters,  electrical  cookers,  electrical  stoves  where\r\n\r\nusage of electricity is very high, and even energy saving\r\n\r\nlamps.  I will always buy lamps that state \"energy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaving\"  on its cover, but I do not know how much savings\r\n\r\nI actually save.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for building efficiency, we need more 3P\r\n\r\npartnerships.   The National Energy Efficiency  Committee\r\n\r\n(NEEC),  under the National Environment Agency, has  just\r\n\r\nstarted  the voluntary energy audit schemes with industry\r\n\r\nthat has high usage of oil and gas to better manage their\r\n\r\nenergy  use.   The first initiative was targeted  at  the\r\n\r\npetroleum companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Committee to establish the industry\r\n\r\nstandards  of measurable energy efficiency indicators  of\r\n\r\nbuildings  in  Singapore quickly and  encourage  building\r\n\r\nowners  to  sign up for this energy audit to ensure  that\r\n\r\nour buildings are efficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trend now is that everyone wants glass curtain\r\n\r\nwalling  in  offices and even in houses where  the  glass\r\n\r\nwindow  is  like  a glass door with full ceiling  height.\r\n\r\nThis  feature gives maximum view to the outside but  also\r\n\r\nhas  a bigger area of heat transmission to the inside  of\r\n\r\nthe  building.  What are the measures taken by the Agency\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  such  commercial buildings  are  energy\r\n\r\nefficient,  including the residential flats  and  houses?\r\n\r\nIs  the  overall thermal transmission value that  governs\r\n\r\ncommercial  buildings  for glass  curtain  walling  still\r\n\r\nvalid?  If it is, should not our residential development,\r\n\r\nespecially  condominiums, be subject to this review  too?\r\n\r\nTo be more applicable, are there other more direct values\r\n\r\nsuch as the amount of energy taken to cool a building?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, with the war coming in\r\n\r\nthe  next  few  days, I think oil prices  will  increase.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   I   think  it  is  useful  for   an   energy\r\n\r\nconservation  habit.  As my colleague,  Dr  Teo  Ho  Pin,\r\n\r\nsaid, we should have an energy conservation culture.  For\r\n\r\nthe  domestic sector, we should also have programmes like\r\n\r\nwhat  Mdm Cynthia Phua said, to show how we can  save  on\r\n\r\nthe  usage  of  energy  when we use  air-conditioners  or\r\n\r\nrefrigerators with energy labelling information.  Will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENV  undertake  such a programme and  also  put  up  some\r\n\r\ntargets for energy saving?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, war or no war,\r\n\r\nenergy  is a strategic resource which we do not  actually\r\n\r\nproduce.  If we were to drive around at night, whether in\r\n\r\nthe city or in our housing estates, we realise that there\r\n\r\nis room for energy conservation.  I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  what  is the pattern of energy  utilisation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and what lessons can we draw from them in terms\r\n\r\nof  energy  conservation.  What can the  Ministry  do  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  better energy conservation and  optimisation,\r\n\r\nboth for the commercial and residential areas?  Does  the\r\n\r\nrecent awareness and need for greater safety and security\r\n\r\nresult in our using more energy for lighting up purposes?\r\n\r\nAnd how does the Environment Ministry reconcile this need\r\n\r\nfor new use of energy and electricity with conservation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Environment (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</b> Sir, on behalf of the Minister, I thank the\r\n\r\nMembers  for  their questions and concerns  about  energy\r\n\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has asked what are the key policies\r\n\r\nand  strategies  to  encourage  energy  conservation   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We have good reasons to have a need for  such\r\n\r\npolicies.   We  are a society that runs  on  energy.   It\r\n\r\nfuels  our  industries, drives our economy and allows  us\r\n\r\nour  quality  of  life.  And all energy in  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nderived from fossil fuels - oil or natural gas.   We  are\r\n\r\ntotally  dependent  on  imported supplies.   We  have  no\r\n\r\nenergy source of our own and no control over the price of\r\n\r\noil  or  natural gas.  And Members have pointed out  that\r\n\r\nthis is dependent on world events, like the coming war.\r\n\r\n<br>12.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive strategy to deal with energy use is\r\n\r\ntherefore   needed.    The  National  Energy   Efficiency\r\n\r\nCommittee  (NEEC)  is a national multi-agency  committee,\r\n\r\nwith ENV as the lead agency, to formulate policies on our\r\n\r\nuse of energy.  NEEC has set out three objectives for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.  One, to be energy efficient, that is, to  get\r\n\r\nthe  maximum output and ability to enjoy our  quality  of\r\n\r\nlife from each unit of energy use.  This will reduce  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  our  quality of life and improve  our  economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  Two, to be carbon efficient,  that  is,\r\n\r\nto  get the maximum output and quality of life from  each\r\n\r\nmolecule  of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis will result in less green house gases and we will be\r\n\r\nplaying  our part in reducing the effects of green  house\r\n\r\ngases on global warming.  Three, to be eco-efficient,  at\r\n\r\nleast  to have the minimum effect on our eco-system  from\r\n\r\nthe  emission  of  particulates and pollutants,  such  as\r\n\r\nsulphur  dioxide and nitrate oxide, which can occur  when\r\n\r\nfossil fuels are burned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall begin with energy efficiency. What are our\r\n\r\nstrategies  to  enhance energy efficiency?   We  wish  to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  efficiency  of energy  use  throughout  the\r\n\r\nenergy  cycle  and in all sectors of energy  use  without\r\n\r\naffecting the life that we enjoy.  For example, on a  hot\r\n\r\nand  humid day, after work, a Singaporean goes to  a  pub\r\n\r\nand  enjoys a chilled glass of beer in the airconditioned\r\n\r\ncomfort  of the premises.  The enjoyment of this  quality\r\n\r\nof  life is dependent on the consumption of energy.   Our\r\n\r\ngoal  is  not  to stop the Singaporean from enjoying  his\r\n\r\nbeer  in order to save energy.  We want him to enjoy  his\r\n\r\nbeer but with the minimum amount of fossil fuel burned to\r\n\r\nprovide  him  the pleasure of drinking his chilled  beer.\r\n\r\nTo do this, several efficiencies are needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brewery must use efficient machinery to brew the\r\n\r\nbeer.   The vehicle that brings the beer to the pub  must\r\n\r\nbe  fuel efficient.  The refrigerator in the pub must  be\r\n\r\nenergy  efficient.   The building in  which  the  pub  is\r\n\r\nlocated must be designed so that it can have an efficient\r\n\r\nairconditioning  system.   The airconditioning  equipment\r\n\r\nmust be efficient in the quantity of electricity it needs\r\n\r\nto  provide  each unit of cooling that it produces.   The\r\n\r\npower  plant  that generates electricity  that  runs  the\r\n\r\nairconditioner  must also be efficient in the  conversion\r\n\r\nof  energy in fossil fuels to electrical energy.  If  all\r\n\r\nthese are in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplace,  the Singaporean will be drinking his beer  in  an\r\n\r\nenergy-efficient  manner.   We  must  therefore  aim  for\r\n\r\nenergy efficiency throughout the energy cycle and in  all\r\n\r\nsectors  of energy use.  50% of fossil fuels in Singapore\r\n\r\nare  used  for  the generation of electricity,  and  this\r\n\r\nmakes it the most important factor in the energy cycle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed asked if privatisation of\r\n\r\nenergy  supply  would  help to  make  the  industry  more\r\n\r\nefficient.  Sir, at the beginning of this year,  the  new\r\n\r\nelectricity  market  came  into  effect  and  electricity\r\n\r\ngenerators  are  required to sell electricity  through  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  bidding  process.  In anticipation  of  this\r\n\r\ncompetition,  the  power companies  have  over  the  past\r\n\r\nseveral  years  sought greater generation  efficiency  to\r\n\r\nmaintain their commercial viability.  Most have opted  to\r\n\r\nswitch  to  natural  gas  and combined  cycle  generation\r\n\r\ntechnologies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the latest combined cycle plants at the\r\n\r\nSeraya  power plant have achieved efficiency as  high  as\r\n\r\n56%,  compared  to  about 39% for steam  turbine  plants.\r\n\r\nThis  translates to an efficiency of more than  40%.   In\r\n\r\nthe  future,  it may be possible to use cogen  generators\r\n\r\nthat  use  the  thermal  energy lost  during  electricity\r\n\r\ngeneration to run central cooling systems.  Co-generation\r\n\r\nplants  can  achieve efficiency of 70% and  higher.   But\r\n\r\nthey are constrained in terms of size and location.  A co-generation  facility  has already been  built  in  Jurong\r\n\r\nIsland   to  provide  both  electricity  and   steam   to\r\n\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua and Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed asked\r\n\r\nabout the pattern of energy utilisation and energy audits\r\n\r\nin  manufacturing and in the home.  Manufacturing is  the\r\n\r\nsecond most important sector accounting for 47% of  total\r\n\r\nenergy  use.   28% is derived directly from fossil  fuels\r\n\r\nand  19%  from electricity produced by power plants.   To\r\n\r\nimprove efficiency in this sector, we need better  energy\r\n\r\nmanagement.   An  energy audit scheme was  launched  last\r\n\r\nyear.  So far, three refineries and a petrochemical plant\r\n\r\nhave  participated in the scheme and they  have  reported\r\n\r\nimprovement in energy efficiency and reduction in  energy\r\n\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently working with industry associations\r\n\r\nto  extend  energy audit schemes to more industries.   We\r\n\r\nare   also  working  with  our  partners,  EDB,  NUS  and\r\n\r\nindustry, to set up a framework to train energy  managers\r\n\r\nfor the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport sector accounts for 20% of total\r\n\r\nenergy  consumption.  Public transport is more  efficient\r\n\r\nthan  passenger cars.  It requires about 0.9 mega  joules\r\n\r\nto  move  a  passenger a kilometre by MRT, and about  0.9\r\n\r\nmega joules by a bus.  A passenger car requires seven  to\r\n\r\n10 times more energy than MRT, about 1.5 to 2 mega joules\r\n\r\nto  move a passenger 1 kilometre.  There are already many\r\n\r\nregulatory requirements that restrict car ownership,  and\r\n\r\nwe are not suggesting any new ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for those who do buy cars, the NEEC will be\r\n\r\nlaunching a scheme to help them make informed choices.  A\r\n\r\nvoluntary   fuel   economy  labelling  scheme   will   be\r\n\r\nimplemented  later this year.  The main objective  is  to\r\n\r\nraise consumer awareness of the fuel economy of cars.  By\r\n\r\nlooking  at the fuel economy labels, consumers  would  be\r\n\r\nable   to  make  better  informed  decisions  on   energy\r\n\r\nefficiency  when they wish to purchase a  new  car.   The\r\n\r\nNational Environment Agency is also working with LTA  and\r\n\r\nother agencies to review green vehicle rebates to promote\r\n\r\nthe  use  of more energy-efficient cars, such  as  hybrid\r\n\r\ncars.   Through  these  measures, car  dealers  would  be\r\n\r\nencouraged to bring in more energy-efficient vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building sector accounts for 17% of total energy\r\n\r\nuse  in  Singapore.  Minimum energy performance standards\r\n\r\nfor  buildings already exist in the form of design  codes\r\n\r\nand  regulations.  While design codes and regulations are\r\n\r\nuseful to establish minimum energy performance standards,\r\n\r\nthe  subsequent operation and maintenance of  centralised\r\n\r\nairconditioning   plants   in   buildings   are   equally\r\n\r\nimportant.  One way of monitoring energy efficiency is to\r\n\r\naudit  energy use.  NEA will work with the town  councils\r\n\r\nand building owners to pro-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmote  energy  audits.   NEEC  also  identifies  promising\r\n\r\ntechnologies  that  promote energy  efficiency  and  will\r\n\r\ndisseminate this information to the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua and Mr Othman Haron Eusofe also\r\n\r\nasked  about  energy  labels  for  household  appliances.\r\n\r\nConsumers and households account for 11% of total  energy\r\n\r\nused  in  Singapore.   Airconditioning  and  refrigerator\r\n\r\naccount for 45% to 60% of a household's energy use.  This\r\n\r\nis  the  reason why we have targeted these two appliances\r\n\r\nfor labelling.  A voluntary labelling scheme was launched\r\n\r\nlast  year  for  refrigerators and airconditioners.   Ten\r\n\r\nmajor   brands  representing  33  refrigerator   and   20\r\n\r\nairconditioner models have been labelled  over  the  last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our aim is to guide consumer purchasing behaviour\r\n\r\ntowards  sustainability  in energy  use.   Education  and\r\n\r\nawareness   on   energy  efficient   airconditioner   and\r\n\r\nrefrigerator  models, as well as energy saving  tips  are\r\n\r\nincluded in the information kit for new HDB flat  owners.\r\n\r\nWe  have developed the simple tick system to identify the\r\n\r\nenergy efficiency of appliances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua asked how it works. It is quite\r\n\r\nsimple.   One  tick is good; two ticks are better;  three\r\n\r\nticks  are the best.  To find out how much you save,  you\r\n\r\nlook at the machine with one tick, you know how much  you\r\n\r\nhave  to  spend every month;  you look at the  equivalent\r\n\r\nappliance  with  three ticks and you know  how  much  you\r\n\r\nspend   per   month,  the  difference  is  your   saving.\r\n\r\nEventually,  distributors  will  respond  to   consumer's\r\n\r\nchoice and bring in mainly three-tick appliances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second goal, how can we be more carbon\r\n\r\nefficient?   By switching to natural gas.   With  natural\r\n\r\ngas,  for  each  unit  of  energy produced,  less  carbon\r\n\r\ndioxide is released into the atmosphere.  CO2 is  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  green house gases associated with global warming and\r\n\r\nusing  natural  gas  is  therefore  more  environmentally\r\n\r\nfriendly.   Singapore  will soon be  getting  its  second\r\n\r\nnatural  gas  supply  and, together  with  the  gas  from\r\n\r\nNatunas,  we expect to have a total of 475 million  cubic\r\n\r\nfeet per day of natural gas.  And this volume is expected\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto increase to 675 million cubic feet per day by 2009.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can mitigate the effects of carbon emission by\r\n\r\nfixing carbon in bio-mass.  Big countries have large land\r\n\r\nmasses   and  they  can  do  this  through  reforestation\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   In  Singapore, we do not  have  large  land\r\n\r\nmasses and whatever land is green.  Our urban environment\r\n\r\nis  planned  to provide greenery and green  spaces  which\r\n\r\npromote carbon fixation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we do to be more eco-efficient and reduce\r\n\r\nthe  level  of  pollutants  emitted  in  the  atmosphere?\r\n\r\nCurrently,  levels  of air pollutants,  such  as  sulphur\r\n\r\ndioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate materials in  our\r\n\r\nambient   air  are  within  US  EPA  standards  and   WHO\r\n\r\nstandards.  In the next five to 10 years, it is estimated\r\n\r\nthat fossil fuel consumption for energy would increase by\r\n\r\nabout 5% per year and so the emission of these pollutants\r\n\r\nwill  also  increase.  So we need to switch to a  cleaner\r\n\r\nfuel.   Natural  gas  is a clean  fuel.   The  switch  to\r\n\r\nnatural gas by our power generation sector has led  to  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial reduction in the emission of pollutants.   In\r\n\r\nthe  transport  sector, a shift from diesel  vehicles  to\r\n\r\ncompressed natural gas vehicles will reduce the  emission\r\n\r\nof  pollutants.  Later this week, I will be flagging  off\r\n\r\neight  Toyota  CNG  taxis as part  of  our  programme  to\r\n\r\npromote   green  vehicles.   NEA  is  working  with   gas\r\n\r\nsuppliers  and  fleet operators to  build  a  network  of\r\n\r\nrefilling  stations  across the  island  to  promote  the\r\n\r\nswitch from diesel to CNG.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there other ways of obtaining clean energy? We\r\n\r\nhave  NEWater  through the application of new  innovative\r\n\r\ntechnology.   Perhaps, some time in the future,  we  will\r\n\r\nhave  new  energy.  We are in the tropics  with  lots  of\r\n\r\nsunshine,  so naturally we are studying how solar  energy\r\n\r\ncan  be  harnessed  as a source of energy  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  are  several projects which are ongoing, including\r\n\r\nprojects like the car park lighting in the Sembawang Town\r\n\r\nCouncil,  landscape lighting at Adam Road Hawker  Centre,\r\n\r\nPV  in Changi Naval Base, and there is also a project  in\r\n\r\nMarsiling Secondary School using PV equipment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed asked whether the recent\r\n\r\nawareness  and need for greater safety have  resulted  in\r\n\r\nmore  energy for lighting up purposes.  Lighting up  will\r\n\r\nconsume  electricity.   The question  is  whether  it  is\r\n\r\nexcessive.   There should be a balance between sufficient\r\n\r\nlighting  for  safety  and security purposes  and  energy\r\n\r\nconservation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked whether we would consider an\r\n\r\nenergy  conservation law.  ENV does not have any plan  to\r\n\r\nintroduce   any  restrictive  energy  conservation   law.\r\n\r\nInstead  of  using  legislation  to  force  change,   the\r\n\r\napproach  that  we  are adopting is to create  awareness,\r\n\r\nbuild   up  local  capacity  and  capability  in   energy\r\n\r\nefficient practices and focus on programmes and  measures\r\n\r\nthat  are  effective  and, yet, financially  viable.   As\r\n\r\nshown by experience with the power generation sector, the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of competition and market forces  leads  to\r\n\r\nenergy  efficiency.   Our approach  is  to  align  market\r\n\r\nefficiency  and energy efficiency.  This way, the  market\r\n\r\ndrives energy efficiency and reduces cost to business and\r\n\r\nconsumers.  Restrictive legislation can easily  become  a\r\n\r\nburden  on  our economy.  Our approach is  to  create  an\r\n\r\nenergy  policy that promotes the competitiveness  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy  by reducing cost and increasing output.   Energy\r\n\r\nefficiency  is good for every one.  It is  good  for  our\r\n\r\nenvironment.    It  is  good  for  business,   good   for\r\n\r\nconsumers.  And it is good for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, in support of the UN Agenda 21\r\n\r\non  sustainable development, Singapore has developed  our\r\n\r\nGreen Plan 2012.  The three key thrusts in the Green Plan\r\n\r\nare,  namely,  (a)  quality  living  environment  through\r\n\r\ninnovative and effective use of technology and  efficient\r\n\r\nuse   of  resources  to  minimise  the  impact  of  human\r\n\r\nactivities  on  the environment; (b) active participation\r\n\r\nof  all sectors of population; and (c) doing our part for\r\n\r\nthe  global environment.  Despite the launch of the Green\r\n\r\nPlan  2012, many Singaporeans are still not aware of  it.\r\n\r\nMany  are  apathetic and do not know what roles they  can\r\n\r\nplay   in   the  Green  Plan.   In  addition,  not   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   understand  the  concept  of   sustainable\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, environmental sustainability is not just about\r\n\r\nkeeping  the environment sustainable.  It has many  other\r\n\r\nimplications affecting the livelihood of our people.  The\r\n\r\nenvironmental management industry is a growing  industry,\r\n\r\nand  can create many jobs for Singaporeans.  It can  spin\r\n\r\noff  many economic benefits and contributions to our GDP.\r\n\r\nThus,  I would urge the Government to place more emphasis\r\n\r\nto seize the opportunities of this sunrise industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) What is the progress of Singapore's efforts in\r\n\r\nsupporting the UN Agenda 21 on Sustainable Development?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) What is the public education programme to\r\n\r\nincrease  awareness among Singaporeans on the concept  of\r\n\r\nsustainable development?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Are there plans to expand the scope of our\r\n\r\nenvironmental sustainability efforts?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, it was reported in\r\n\r\nGreen Plan 2012 that Singapore, together with other small\r\n\r\ncountries,  was  left  out  of the  second  Environmental\r\n\r\nSustainability  Index (ESI) report  commissioned  by  the\r\n\r\nWorld Economic Forum because of its small size and unique\r\n\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether we\r\n\r\nhave   our   own   ESI  to  track  our   performance   in\r\n\r\nenvironmental sustainability to compare against those  of\r\n\r\nother  countries,  or do we have plans  to  develop  some\r\n\r\nsimilar form of performance measures.  If we have one, or\r\n\r\nare planning to have one, what are the factors taken into\r\n\r\naccount   for  the  purpose  of  tracking  and  comparing\r\n\r\nperformance, and what are the targets set?  If  not,  how\r\n\r\nthen  do  we  assess  our  performance  in  environmental\r\n\r\nsustainability?   I would like to note at  this  juncture\r\n\r\nthat the Minister had answered\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npart  of  these  questions in reference  to  the  various\r\n\r\ncolours of our earth and the sky.  But I feel that we may\r\n\r\nwant to have more tangible indicators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to ask the Minister how we have\r\n\r\nfared   in  terms  of  noise  pollution,  especially   in\r\n\r\nresidential  areas.  Does the Ministry  work  with  other\r\n\r\nGovernment  authorities, such as the MND,  regarding  the\r\n\r\nsiting of residential developments in areas which may  be\r\n\r\nsubject  to  noise pollution, eg, military airbases?   Is\r\n\r\nany  environmental impact study done for  such  proposals\r\n\r\nbefore they are approved?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last area I would like to touch on with regard\r\n\r\nto  our  Green Plan is how we have fared in  keeping  our\r\n\r\ncity  clean,  green  and  litter-free.   The  litter-free\r\n\r\ncampaign  has  been  around for a  long  time.   However,\r\n\r\ndespite  fines,  work orders and constant  admonishments,\r\n\r\nlittering  still  remains a problem.   Every  night,  the\r\n\r\nareas around the letter boxes in most HDB void decks  are\r\n\r\nstrewn  with mail junked by residents, even if there  are\r\n\r\nbins  nearby.  Grounds used for functions,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nyear-end countdown, are also usually covered with  litter\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of the function.  In fact, even in  private\r\n\r\ncondominiums, I have witnessed durian husks being  dumped\r\n\r\nin  the  lift  after the fruit has been eaten!   However,\r\n\r\nbeing  an  optimist, a positive aspect of  this  negative\r\n\r\nbehaviour  is that at least it creates jobs for  cleaners\r\n\r\nand helps towards reducing unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on a more serious note, we must step up our\r\n\r\nefforts to inculcate in Singaporeans a sense of ownership\r\n\r\nand  responsibility for public places and  the  habit  of\r\n\r\nthrowing  rubbish in the right place.  May I  suggest  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  that  he should work with  all  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  and  other event organisers,  as  well  as\r\n\r\nGovernment authorities, to make every event a litter-free\r\n\r\nday.   Singaporeans should learn, like  the  Koreans,  to\r\n\r\ntake   ownership  of  their  rubbish  and  discard   them\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Teo Ho Pin, please take both cuts\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, 3P partnership.

To achieve concerted\r\n\r\nefforts  of the 3Ps, viz, the public, private and  people\r\n\r\nsectors,  requires strong will-power from the Government,\r\n\r\nthe business community and our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to learn that the Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment    has   implemented   the   Innovation    on\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Sustainability  Scheme.

Singaporeans  must feel  passionate  about  the\r\n\r\nenvironment   and  take  initiatives   to   protect   our\r\n\r\nenvironment.   Many sceptics have said that Singapore  is\r\n\r\nable to maintain a clean and green environment because it\r\n\r\nis  a  \"fine\" city, where people are fined for littering.\r\n\r\nBased on my experience in managing the town council, this\r\n\r\nis  not  true.   In  fact,  we  have  noticed  that  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are becoming more conscious  about  keeping\r\n\r\ntheir living environment clean.  Some residents have even\r\n\r\ntaken  the  initiative to sweep and  clean  their  common\r\n\r\ncorridor outside their HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should continue to encourage such efforts among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and let them\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake ownership of the environment.

It was a very inspiring image of where\r\n\r\nwe are going with the Ministry of the Environment's work.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, many Members have raised a whole range\r\n\r\nof  questions  on some specific aspects,  whether  it  is\r\n\r\nenergy or water conservation, recycling, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is an avid promoter of the 3P concept,\r\n\r\nie,  people,  private and public sector collaboration  in\r\n\r\nall  ventures.   That being the case, one  area  where  I\r\n\r\nwould  really seek greater clarification and  explanation\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister is the aspect of public education  on\r\n\r\nthe Ministry's various initiatives and endeavours.  I say\r\n\r\nthis   because  perhaps  the  most  famous  and  enduring\r\n\r\ncampaigns  we  have had in Singapore on public  education\r\n\r\nmessages is keeping Singapore clean and green.   This  is\r\n\r\none   of  the  core  thrusts  of  the  Ministry  of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment.   Although we can argue about how  effective\r\n\r\nit  is in modifying behaviour, the fact remains that, for\r\n\r\nmost,  if not all Singaporeans, this occupies a big  part\r\n\r\nof  their  mind's space so that, even if they do  litter,\r\n\r\nthey do it guiltily.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being the case, and given the variety of new\r\n\r\nenvironmental  challenges that Singapore faces,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the Minister how intensive is  our  public\r\n\r\neducation  campaign going to be to get the people  sector\r\n\r\nand  the  private sector to buy into this whole  slew  of\r\n\r\nobjectives  and environmental targets that  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas outlined.  What would be the indicators of success in\r\n\r\nthese campaigns, because the fact remains that there  may\r\n\r\nbe  an  element  of campaign fatigue among  Singaporeans?\r\n\r\nSo,  the  Ministry  will  have  to  choose  its  strategy\r\n\r\ncarefully  and  keep it focused.  It is  quite  essential\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry  formulate  a  cohesive  and  focused\r\n\r\nstrategy in getting the private and people sectors to buy\r\n\r\ninto its broad environmental roadmap.  I would appreciate\r\n\r\na clarification and explanation from the Minister on this\r\n\r\nscore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, hawker centres play a\r\n\r\nsignificant  part  in  the lives  of  many  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nToday, hawker centres continue to provide cheap and  good\r\n\r\nfood,  which helps to lower the cost of living  for  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  The concept of hawker centres has  been  a\r\n\r\ngreat success.  Many Singaporeans, rich or poor, frequent\r\n\r\nhawker  centres to enjoy a wide range of food.   Thus,  I\r\n\r\nhope  the Government can place more emphasis and  support\r\n\r\non hawker centres in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should allocate more resources to upgrade\r\n\r\nexisting  hawker  centres that are easily  accessible  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   I hope that the Ministry will  develop  a\r\n\r\nmaster  plan  for  the development of hawker  centres  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many advantages to have more hawker\r\n\r\ncentres.   Firstly, they provide cheap and good  food  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  at  convenient locations.   Secondly,  they\r\n\r\nprovide   opportunities  for  Singaporeans  to   set   up\r\n\r\nbusinesses   and,  thirdly,  they  attract  tourists   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But we must not increase the cost of business\r\n\r\nfor hawkers, especially their rental and utility charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) What is the status of merging the hawker\r\n\r\ndepartments of HDB and ENV?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Is there a master plan to rationalise the\r\n\r\ndevelopment and upgrading of hawker centres?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) What are the measures to keep rental of hawker\r\n\r\ncentres low, so as to reduce business costs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Can the Ministry consider a tenant mix policy\r\n\r\nfor hawker centres to provide more choices for consumers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, the Hawker Centres\r\n\r\nUpgrading  Programme is yet another pro-active initiative\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry of the Environment that has  been  well\r\n\r\nreceived by the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how many hawker\r\n\r\ncentres have been upgraded since the announcement of  the\r\n\r\nprogramme in 2001.  What are the average take-up rates of\r\n\r\nstalls at these upgraded centres?  How well received  are\r\n\r\nthese  upgraded centres by the hawkers?   How  many  more\r\n\r\nhawker centres will be upgraded under the programme?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that whilst the upgraded hawker centres\r\n\r\nI  have  visited  are clearly much better  than  the  old\r\n\r\ncentres   in   terms  of  design,  ventilation,   seating\r\n\r\narrangement, etc, to ensure that the designs are not only\r\n\r\narchitecturally  pleasing but also user and  maintenance-friendly,  I suggest that a panel of advisers be  formed.\r\n\r\nThe  proposed  panel could comprise the adviser  for  the\r\n\r\narea,  stakeholders,  eg,  the  grassroots  leaders   and\r\n\r\nstallholders,   as  well  as  property   management   and\r\n\r\nmaintenance  professionals,  to  provide  inputs  on  the\r\n\r\ndesign features of the proposed new hawker centres before\r\n\r\nplans are finalised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, whilst hawker centres are welcome by many\r\n\r\nfor   their   cheaper   food  and  convenience,   as   my\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleague has earlier suggested, it may not\r\n\r\nbe  particularly  popular with the young,  who  generally\r\n\r\nprefer air-conditioned food courts.  Some existing hawker\r\n\r\ncentres may also not be doing well due\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  poor  accessibility  as well  as  a  small  catchment\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I propose that a comprehensive study of all\r\n\r\nexisting hawker centres, which have not been upgraded, be\r\n\r\nundertaken  to, among others, evaluate the  viability  of\r\n\r\nretaining  and  rebuilding these hawker centres.   Hawker\r\n\r\ncentres  which are not viable should not be  rebuilt  and\r\n\r\nshould  perhaps even be demolished in the medium to  long\r\n\r\nterm.   The  Ministry could then consider  enlarging  the\r\n\r\nmore  popular hawker centres and relocating the  affected\r\n\r\nstallholders  to these enlarged centres.  A comprehensive\r\n\r\nplan  for  upgrading hawker centres would be economically\r\n\r\nmore efficient and useful than ad-hoc programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nduring  the Budget debate last year, I asked the Minister\r\n\r\nfor   the  Environment  whether  his  Ministry  had   any\r\n\r\nintention to take over the control of all hawker centres.\r\n\r\nAt  the moment, hawker centres come under the control  of\r\n\r\nthree  Government  agencies,  namely,  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nNational Development, the Ministry of the Environment and\r\n\r\nthe town councils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawker centres provide cheap and good food for our\r\n\r\npeople.   They  are very important to the  lives  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.   For  the Chinese, there is fried kway  teow  or\r\n\r\nHokkien mee; for the Malays, there is nasi lemak; and for\r\n\r\nthe  Indians, there is roti prata.  Apart from all  these\r\n\r\ndelicacies,  we  can have a mix of food  for  our  Malay,\r\n\r\nChinese  and  Indian Singaporeans, all  under  one  roof.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly good for the enhancement of  our racial\r\n\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I understand that HDB is not going to build\r\n\r\nany more hawker centres in its new housing estates. So, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to know whether there is any change in  plan.\r\n\r\nSince  the hawker centre is such a good thing, we  should\r\n\r\npreserve  it. For example, in the past, the  wet  markets\r\n\r\nwere  changed to dry markets.  Now, the trend  is  to  go\r\n\r\nback  to  wet markets.  Hawker centres are very important\r\n\r\nto  us.

However,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  take  this  opportunity to compliment  HDB  for\r\n\r\nhaving a partial upgrading programme for upgrading of the\r\n\r\nmarkets   as   early  as  1992  and  now,  the   National\r\n\r\nEnvironment Agency for the full upgrading programme.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I have been involved directly in the\r\n\r\npartial  upgrading of at least four hawker centres  under\r\n\r\nthe HDB programme when I was the former CEO of Bishan-Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh Town Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to make some comments on the\r\n\r\ndesign of the upgraded hawker centres.  Although the size\r\n\r\nof  the  stalls  is  bigger, efforts should  be  made  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the needs of the different types of  hawkers,\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  the ergonomics of the stall design  versus\r\n\r\ntheir workflow. This is critical especially for vegetable\r\n\r\nand  fruit  stallholders where they need to display  many\r\n\r\nvarieties  within the confined space of the stalls.   The\r\n\r\nAustralians  had  done well and SPRING  had  brought  the\r\n\r\nspecialists into Singapore to help our shopkeepers.   Our\r\n\r\narchitects/designers involved in this upgrading programme\r\n\r\nshould tap into this expert knowledge.  If not, our stall\r\n\r\ndesigns   would  go  back  to  the  basics  again   after\r\n\r\nupgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to helping our stallholders to upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir skills on the display of goods (lifelong learning),\r\n\r\nthe Agency may want to assist them in organising suitable\r\n\r\ncourses  and encourage them to upgrade their  skills  and\r\n\r\nknowledge  on  display.  So when the hawker  centres  are\r\n\r\nupgraded,  you have not only a new physical  environment,\r\n\r\nbut a new skill and a new way of doing business as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again on designs, although the Agency has taken into\r\n\r\naccount  the  design of the upgraded  hawker  and  market\r\n\r\ncentres by having good natural ventilation, lighting  and\r\n\r\nalfresco dining areas, it must not be sacrificed for  the\r\n\r\nsufficiency of seats in the upgraded hawker centres.  Let\r\n\r\nme explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a ratio of seats to stalls.

These are experienced  by\r\n\r\nsome of the customers in the upgraded hawker centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final question is: since ENV has plans to\r\n\r\nconsolidate  all  ENV and HDB hawker  centres  under  the\r\n\r\nAgency   for  better  synergy  of  resources  and  better\r\n\r\ncoordination, will there be a re-look into the synergy of\r\n\r\nall  the  hawker and market centres, where some are  very\r\n\r\nclose to each other?

Are there incentives for stallholders to aim to\r\n\r\nachieve an A grade?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next question is: hawker stalls are now\r\n\r\nallocated  on a tender basis.  Will the Ministry  reserve\r\n\r\nsome   stalls   to  be  allocated  for  hardship   cases,\r\n\r\nespecially for older workers who are retrenched  and  may\r\n\r\nhave difficulty getting re-employment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, Members of this House\r\n\r\nhave,  over the past few days, brought up instances where\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  against women remains,  such  as  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits  for civil servants and citizenship for children\r\n\r\nof Singaporean women married to foreigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to bring a more fundamental and\r\n\r\npressing  area  where women are unwittingly discriminated\r\n\r\nagainst  and,  that is, by the current  state  of  public\r\n\r\ntoilets in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain why I have made this observation.\r\n\r\nPresently, most men and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwomen's  toilets in public places are a mirror  image  of\r\n\r\none  another  in  terms of size, except for  the  urinal.\r\n\r\nAccording  to the President of WTO - no, not World  Trade\r\n\r\nOrganisation but World Toilet Organisation - Mr Jack Sim,\r\n\r\nstudies  have shown that men take 30 seconds  to  urinate\r\n\r\nbut  women take about three times as long, to be precise,\r\n\r\n92  seconds.   Furthermore,  women  being  more  sociable\r\n\r\ncreatures, socialise in the toilets as they powder.   Men\r\n\r\ndo not. They neither powder nor socialise. Yet, most male\r\n\r\nand  female toilets in public areas usually have the same\r\n\r\nnumber of cubicles and, on top of this, men have urinals.\r\n\r\nTo  me, this is clearly gender discrimination, hence, the\r\n\r\nfrequent long queues witnessed in women's toilets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insufficient toilet provision leads to high traffic\r\n\r\nand  heavy usage for toilets. Therefore, women's  toilets\r\n\r\nusually  become dirtier than men's.  Some women may  even\r\n\r\nhave to resort to doing kung-fu stance over the WC as the\r\n\r\nseat  cover  is  dirty  beyond mere  wiping  with  tissue\r\n\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To redress this problem, highly scientific and\r\n\r\nrigorous  studies have actually been done and have  shown\r\n\r\nthat  the right number of cubicles required in the ladies\r\n\r\nshould be based on a formula:  total number of cubicles +\r\n\r\nurinals  in the gents x 2.  This is recommended  to  make\r\n\r\nthings  logical  again, as current toilet standards  were\r\n\r\nset  a long time ago when most women stayed at home  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   the   provision   in   public   places   was\r\n\r\ninsufficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been told that in Hong Kong, they are already\r\n\r\ntabling  this  law in Parliament and Japan  and  UK  have\r\n\r\nstrong  lobby groups to make such a change as  well.   I,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  in  all  seriousness now, strongly  urge  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  Ministry  to  work  with  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nNational  Development on stipulating the  requirement  to\r\n\r\nprovide more cubicles in women's toilets as part  of  the\r\n\r\nholistic approach to improve the standards of cleanliness\r\n\r\nin  our public toilets.  This is the hardware aspect. The\r\n\r\nsoft  aspect  will be to continue to educate Singaporeans\r\n\r\non  good  toilet  habits  and responsibility  for  public\r\n\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ENV's sticker slogan goes \"We aim to please,\r\n\r\ncould you aim too, please!\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> Sir, since Dr Amy Khor has raised\r\n\r\nall  the important points on public toilets, I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask the Minister whether he would be going ahead with\r\n\r\nthe ranking of public toilets.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, we spoke on the change of\r\n\r\nname  of the Singapore Zoological Gardens.

This would not be the standard equal to that  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Zoo but would be a comfortable toilet like\r\n\r\nthat in a 3- or 4-star hotel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My questions are: since the introduction of this\r\n\r\nprogramme in July 2002, what is the take-up rate of  this\r\n\r\nscheme?  How much has the Government disbursed to finance\r\n\r\nthis   programme?   Would  the  Government  continue   to\r\n\r\nsubsidise this scheme?  The objective of toilet upgrading\r\n\r\nis  that  it  will help improve the image of  the  public\r\n\r\ntoilets  in  Singapore.  Physical upgrading is  only  the\r\n\r\ninitial   stage.  The  long-sustaining  effort   in   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and cleanliness of the toilet is  even  more\r\n\r\nimportant.  Are there any programmes to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ntoilets would be maintained and kept clean to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  objective  of  the  Toilet  Upgrading  Programme  is\r\n\r\nachieved?

Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the world is\r\n\r\nfacing  the  problem of water shortage due to  population\r\n\r\ngrowth,   environmental  change,  and  the  increase   in\r\n\r\npollution of the water sources.  The UN estimates that by\r\n\r\n2015, at least 40% of the world's population will live in\r\n\r\ncountries  where it is either difficult or impossible  to\r\n\r\naccess clean water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one way, Singapore is unfortunate that the\r\n\r\nnatural  rainfall is just not enough to provide  adequate\r\n\r\nwater  to  meet  the  domestic and  expanding  industrial\r\n\r\ndemands  completely.   The fortunate  part  is  that  our\r\n\r\neconomic strength and technological know-how have enabled\r\n\r\nus to obtain water from unconventional sources in meeting\r\n\r\nour  water demand. This has created the third and  fourth\r\n\r\nwater taps in our policy on water sources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While doing large scale production from\r\n\r\nunconventional  ways,  we have first-hand  experience  in\r\n\r\ndealing  with  and  scientific  innovation  in  resolving\r\n\r\ndifficulties associated with the production process.  The\r\n\r\nknowledge gained from the empirical operational know-how,\r\n\r\nprocess design and proprietary knowledge will not only be\r\n\r\nan  asset  in  Singapore to produce  water  to  meet  our\r\n\r\ndemand, it is also an important industrial asset that  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  receive significant world  demand  in  easing\r\n\r\nwater shortage in the long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the best technology for this\r\n\r\nunconventional way of water production is in the hands of\r\n\r\nthe  Americans  and the Europeans. This is  a  very  high\r\n\r\nvalue-added industry. While we are looking for ideas  for\r\n\r\nthe  future  growth  of  our manufacturing  and  services\r\n\r\nsectors,  to  further  develop  our  water  industry  and\r\n\r\nposition  Singapore as a new player in  the  world  water\r\n\r\nmarket  could be viable.  In order to achieve all  these,\r\n\r\nthere  are  a  lot of things that we can  do,  from  R&D,\r\n\r\ntechnological   innovation,  to  getting  local   company\r\n\r\nparticipation, develop them, provide incentives and  help\r\n\r\nthem to compete in the international market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nis: would the Ministry support\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  idea?  What  action  will the  Government  take  to\r\n\r\nrealise this vision?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, the previous Member touched\r\n\r\non  the  issue of SGP 2012.  Dr Teo Ho Pin asked what  is\r\n\r\nthe  overall  progress and whether we have any  plans  to\r\n\r\nexpand   the  scope  of  SGP  2012  beyond  environmental\r\n\r\nsustainability.  Dr Amy Khor asked what is the  relevance\r\n\r\nof  this SGP 2012 in the context of Singapore.  She  also\r\n\r\nasked whether we have come out with our own Environmental\r\n\r\nSustainability Index.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Green Plan 2012 stands up on two\r\n\r\ncounts.   Firstly,  we  are  shifting  our  focus  beyond\r\n\r\nperformance towards sustainability, and secondly, we have\r\n\r\nset quantifiable targets in SGP 2012.  In fact, there are\r\n\r\nnot  many  countries that I know of that  have  set  such\r\n\r\nclear  targets towards sustainability.  For  example,  in\r\n\r\nthe  case of landfill, solid waste management, we  set  a\r\n\r\ntarget  of  60% recycling.  We set a target of  extending\r\n\r\nthe landfill site life-span to 50 years.  In the case  of\r\n\r\nsupply of non-conventional water, we set a target of  25%\r\n\r\nby  the  year  2012.  So, clearly, these are  performance\r\n\r\nmeasures which are quantifiable and which will contribute\r\n\r\ntowards sustainability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to reassure Members of the House that\r\n\r\nwhen we talk about sustainability, it is not a slogan for\r\n\r\nENV,  NEA or PUB.  It is for real and, in fact,  we  have\r\n\r\ncommitted  ourselves  to achieving all  these.   However,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  want to emphasise that just setting  targets  is\r\n\r\nonly  half a step there.  What is important is for us  to\r\n\r\ntransmit this commitment on paper into real action on the\r\n\r\nground.   In that regard, I am happy to say that  we  are\r\n\r\nnow  going one step further by operationalising  the  SGP\r\n\r\n2012.   We  have decided to form a SGP 2012  Coordinating\r\n\r\nCommittee.  This committee is chaired by the CEO of  NEA.\r\n\r\nUnder  this  coordinating committee, there  will  be  six\r\n\r\naction programme committees, covering various areas  such\r\n\r\nas  waste  management,  clean air,  public  health,  pink\r\n\r\nwater,     conserving    nature,    and     international\r\n\r\ncollaboration.  All these are key\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nareas towards sustainability.  At the same time, to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that the Singapore Green Plan 2012 is not a  public\r\n\r\nsector  driven  plan, we intend to  make  sure  that  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  will be driven by the 3P  partners.   So,\r\n\r\nwith that in mind, some 100 members would be appointed to\r\n\r\nthe  various action programme committees, and  more  than\r\n\r\n60%  of  these members will come from the private sector.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that the Singapore Green Plan 2012 will be a\r\n\r\nliving document and programme that will stay relevant  to\r\n\r\nthe  changing environment, the coordinating committee and\r\n\r\nthe  action programme committees would take stock of  its\r\n\r\nprogress  once every year.  It will review the directions\r\n\r\nto  make sure that they remain relevant once every  three\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin asked what we really want to\r\n\r\nachieve  out  of  the Singapore Green  Plan  2012.   Sir,\r\n\r\nobviously, the first outcome we aim to achieve out of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Green Plan 2012 is to enhance the environmental\r\n\r\nsustainability of Singapore.  That is our primary target.\r\n\r\nBut,  we have to recognise there must be a change in  our\r\n\r\nmindset   in   the   way  that  we  go  about   achieving\r\n\r\nsustainability today versus the past.  Because, today, if\r\n\r\nyou  look  at  our  population,  our  people  are  better\r\n\r\neducated and they are more aware of the environment, with\r\n\r\nhigher   expectations   and   higher   demands   on   the\r\n\r\nenvironment.  But, yet at the same time, as a  result  of\r\n\r\nthe  slower growth that we are going through, on the part\r\n\r\nof the Ministry and the statutory boards, we are going to\r\n\r\nbe  faced with a situation of having tighter budgets.  In\r\n\r\nother words, as we pursue the targets set up in Singapore\r\n\r\nGreen  Plan  2012, we have to recognise that  we  can  no\r\n\r\nlonger  adopt the past mindset of doing more  with  more,\r\n\r\nbut, rather try to do more with less.  How can we do more\r\n\r\nwith  less?   Sir,  that reminded me of  a  story.   Four\r\n\r\npersons  came together for a meeting.  These four persons\r\n\r\nare Nobody, Somebody, Anybody and Everybody.  There is  a\r\n\r\njob  to  be done.  Everybody expected Somebody to do  the\r\n\r\njob.   Anybody could have got it done but, at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  day,  Nobody did it.  Sir, at the  end,  we  have  a\r\n\r\nsituation where Everybody is upset that Nobody  did  what\r\n\r\nshould be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndone by Somebody and that could be done by Anybody.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of the Singapore Green Plan 2012,\r\n\r\nin  order to do more with less, we have to make sure that\r\n\r\neverybody  does  not  expect somebody  else  to  get  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Green Plan 2012 done.  In fact,  I  hope  that\r\n\r\neverybody would do his part.  And that is the reason  why\r\n\r\nwe  emphasise  a  lot  on, not just 3P  partnership  but,\r\n\r\nrather,  3P  ownership, because ownership is  commitment.\r\n\r\nAnd,  hopefully, with that commitment, it will turn  into\r\n\r\naction and into alignment of efforts.  Sir, later  on  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Dr  Balaji  will  address  the  issue  of  3P\r\n\r\npartnership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address the various cuts by the Members\r\n\r\nregarding hawker centres and toilet upgrading.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike to relate these two programmes to the concept of  3P\r\n\r\nownership.   Dr Teo Ho Pin, Dr Amy Khor, and others  have\r\n\r\nspoken of the benefits and relevance of hawker centres in\r\n\r\nthe  context of Singapore.  Sir, I fully agree.   Mr  Ang\r\n\r\nMong  Seng  made  the observation that  we  have  stopped\r\n\r\nbuilding hawker centres.  He is exactly right.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nwe have stopped building hawker centres since 1985, about\r\n\r\n17  years  ago.  In the last 10 years, 25 hawker  centres\r\n\r\nwere   closed   down  because  they  were   affected   by\r\n\r\nredevelopment.   In fact, some of us may  wonder  whether\r\n\r\nhawker centres will die a natural death at the way things\r\n\r\nare going.  I want to assure the House that the answer is\r\n\r\nno.   There  is no intention at all, on the part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, to allow the hawker centres to die a  natural\r\n\r\ndeath.   In  fact, that is the reason why the  Government\r\n\r\nhas decided to set aside $420 million, a lot of money and\r\n\r\nresources, to upgrade the various hawker centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor and other Members asked about the\r\n\r\nprogress  under  the Hawker Centres Upgrading  programme.\r\n\r\nSir,  so  far,  16  centres with 1,580 stalls  have  been\r\n\r\nupgraded  at  the  total cost of more than  $40  million.\r\n\r\nAnother  30  more  are in progress.  In fact,  under  the\r\n\r\nPhase I programme, altogether 29 centres would have  been\r\n\r\nupgraded at a total cost of $120 million.  In addition to\r\n\r\nthat, another\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15  centres had been identified under Phase II.  So, this\r\n\r\nwill bring the total number of centres to be upgraded  by\r\n\r\nthe  year  2005  to 44 centres at a total  cost  of  $190\r\n\r\nmillion.   This  year,  we  are going  to  identify  more\r\n\r\ncentres to be upgraded under Phase III, so that over  the\r\n\r\nnext  three  years we would have upgraded  more  than  60\r\n\r\nhawker centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have various suggestions and comments\r\n\r\non the quality of the upgrading, whether there are enough\r\n\r\nseats,  whether too many seats are in the open area,  and\r\n\r\nwhether the design of the new hawker centres would really\r\n\r\nserve  the needs and purpose of the stallholders and  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  public.  Sir, I take all these feedback  and\r\n\r\nsuggestions in a positive light because at NEA and ENV we\r\n\r\nare doing whatever we can.  We are doing our very best in\r\n\r\nworking with architects to design the most suitable  form\r\n\r\nof  hawker  centres, not just in terms of look  and  feel\r\n\r\nbut, more importantly, the user-friendliness, usefulness,\r\n\r\nmaintainability, and so on.  Therefore, I  welcome  these\r\n\r\nfeedback  and  comments from Members, and I  assure  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  NEA, as the agency spearheading  the  Hawker\r\n\r\nCentres Upgrading programme, will continue to take inputs\r\n\r\nfrom  the  grassroots  advisers,  the  stallholders   and\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public and will make sure that every  new\r\n\r\ncentre  that is being upgraded, hopefully, will be better\r\n\r\nthan the previous one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin made a very important point that,\r\n\r\nas  we  upgrade these hawker centres, we must  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the  rental remains affordable to the stallholders.\r\n\r\nHe is exactly right.  In fact, on the part of the NEA and\r\n\r\nENV,  we  are  very conscious of that.  So, that  is  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  we  focus  a  lot of  functionality  in  our\r\n\r\nupgrading, rather than spending on things which  are  not\r\n\r\nnecessary.  In fact, at this moment, we have about 17,000\r\n\r\nstallholders  at the various hawker centres and  markets,\r\n\r\nwith  60%  of them enjoying subsidised rental.  So,  even\r\n\r\nafter  the  upgrading, all 60% of them will  continue  to\r\n\r\nenjoy subsidised rental.  The remaining 40% are on market\r\n\r\nrental.  By now,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers are already aware that we have introduced  a  20%\r\n\r\nrebate  of rental to every stallholder.  For those  whose\r\n\r\nrental is above the market assessed value, they can  have\r\n\r\na  further  20% rebate, which means up to 40%  of  rental\r\n\r\nrebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman Haron Eusofe asked whether we can set\r\n\r\naside  some of these stalls for hardship cases.  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nyou look at our hawker stalls today, as far as the cooked\r\n\r\nfood  stalls are concerned, for most hawker centres, they\r\n\r\nare  fully  taken up.  Today, we have about 1,000  vacant\r\n\r\nstalls,  but  these are mainly in the wet markets,  where\r\n\r\nthe  demand  is not that strong.  But, I take  Mr  Othman\r\n\r\nHaron's suggestion positively. In fact, I have asked  the\r\n\r\nNEA  to  work  with the HDB, the Retail Promotion  Centre\r\n\r\n(RPC), as well as the various CDCs, to see whether we can\r\n\r\ndo  something to reconfigure some of these vacant  stalls\r\n\r\nin  the wet markets and turn them into a useful asset for\r\n\r\nthe unemployed workers to do some small business.  We are\r\n\r\njust  starting this idea.  In fact, we are learning  from\r\n\r\nthe North East CDC Retail Incubator Programme and we hope\r\n\r\nthat  there would be something going on in the  next  few\r\n\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, various Members, Dr Teo Ho Pin, Ang Mong Seng,\r\n\r\nCynthia  Phua  and others, touched on the  need  for  the\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan  to  guide the future  upgrading  of  hawker\r\n\r\ncentres.   Sir,  again, I fully agree  with  the  Members\r\n\r\nbecause,  as we upgrade the hawker centres,  it  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant that we upgrade the centres at the right place.\r\n\r\nThere  is no point in upgrading a centre if there  is  no\r\n\r\nmarket demand for that location.  Likewise, there  is  no\r\n\r\npoint  in  upgrading a hawker centre simply  because  the\r\n\r\npiece  of  land  is  not affected by  redevelopment,  but\r\n\r\nrather  we  should ask ourselves whether we should  start\r\n\r\nbuilding  new hawker centres again.  If so,  where,  when\r\n\r\nand  why.  What NEA is doing is to relook into this whole\r\n\r\nconcept  of  long-term development of the hawker  centres\r\n\r\nand we intend to answer all these questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important question we intend to answer, as\r\n\r\npart  of  this overall planning, is the whole concept  of\r\n\r\nwhether the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanagement of all hawker centres and cooked food  centres\r\n\r\nshould  come under one agency.  At this moment, one-third\r\n\r\nof  the  hawker centres and cooked food centres is  under\r\n\r\nthe  NEA,  two-thirds under the HDB.  So, we are  looking\r\n\r\ninto  whether it makes sense to have one agency  to  take\r\n\r\ncare of all the centres, and discussions between NEA  and\r\n\r\nHDB are on-going.  But, in the meantime, NEA and ENV will\r\n\r\nproceed  with  the development of this long  term  master\r\n\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman Haron asked about the grading of the\r\n\r\ncooked food stalls.  Yes, the programme started in  1997.\r\n\r\nThe  whole purpose is to enhance the cleanliness and  the\r\n\r\nfood  and personal hygiene in our cooked food centres.  I\r\n\r\nmust  say, so far, the response has been good and  we  do\r\n\r\nsee  a  general upgrading of the standard.  But the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  thing, at the end of the day, 5-10 years  from\r\n\r\nnow,  is  whether  the upgraded centres  will  remain  an\r\n\r\nattractive place for the public.  That, I think,  depends\r\n\r\non our 3P partnership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move quickly to the upgrading of the\r\n\r\npublic  toilets.  Again, I take the feedback from Dr  Amy\r\n\r\nKhor in positive light.  I agree with her that the ladies\r\n\r\ndo take longer in using the toilets, and it is very often\r\n\r\nthat  at  such places we see a long queue for the ladies.\r\n\r\nWe  will  see  what  we can do.  But, as  far  as  toilet\r\n\r\nupgrading is concerned, I want to point out that  we  are\r\n\r\nnot  upgrading  public toilets all over Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nprogramme is basically focused on public toilets  at  the\r\n\r\ncoffeeshops.  And whether the coffeeshop owners will find\r\n\r\nit  necessary to have more cubicles for the ladies versus\r\n\r\nthe  men,  I  think  we will have  to  leave  it  to  the\r\n\r\ncoffeeshop  owners to decide.  But what NEA and  ENV  are\r\n\r\ndoing is that we are sharing the cost of upgrading.   The\r\n\r\nresponse  so far has been very good.  In fact,  about  50\r\n\r\ntoilets   have  been  upgraded  and  we  have   committed\r\n\r\n$250,000.   80 more are in the course of being  upgraded.\r\n\r\nWith another 330 indicating their interest to upgrade, we\r\n\r\nexpect to see more than half of the 800 public toilets in\r\n\r\nthe coffeeshops to be upgraded by the end of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the second part, which is\r\n\r\nthat beyond 3P ownership to achieve sustainability, there\r\n\r\nis   something  else  we  hope  to  achieve  through  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Green Plan 2012, which is the point brought  up\r\n\r\nby  Dr  Teo  Ho  Pin.   Dr Teo mentioned  that  there  is\r\n\r\ntremendous economic potential in terms of the environment\r\n\r\nsector.  He is exactly right.  Because, at the end of the\r\n\r\nday,  if  we  focus only on environmental sustainability,\r\n\r\nbut  without  sustaining economic  growth,  environmental\r\n\r\nsustainability  does not really make sense.   Because  at\r\n\r\nthe end of the day we cannot just live on blue sky, fresh\r\n\r\nair and green land.  So economic growth is something that\r\n\r\neveryone  of  us  should play our  part  and  to  make  a\r\n\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, ENV, as the lead agency of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Green Plan 2012, intends to step up our efforts\r\n\r\nin the area of industry development.  We are working very\r\n\r\nclosely  with the various economic agencies and  industry\r\n\r\nto  speed up the development of new capabilities  in  our\r\n\r\nenvironmental industry and, at the same time,  to  expand\r\n\r\nthe business capacity in the industry.  Our intention  is\r\n\r\nto  make Singapore the early adopters in the exploitation\r\n\r\nof   technology,  in  the  exportation  of  products  and\r\n\r\nservices.   Hopefully, this would  add  to  our  national\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Amy Khor asked what we are doing in helping\r\n\r\nthe waste recycling industry to become a regional leader.\r\n\r\nSir,  many  things  are happening.   Today,  due  to  the\r\n\r\nshortage  of time, I will not go into details, except  to\r\n\r\nsay  that basically what we are trying to do is  to  help\r\n\r\nour  environmental industry, the waste recycling industry\r\n\r\nincluded,  to  cross two gates.  Firstly,  to  cross  the\r\n\r\ntechnology gate, and secondly, to cross the market  gate.\r\n\r\nThe  reason  why  we  have  to help  them  to  cross  the\r\n\r\ntechnology  gate  is  because the environment  sector  is\r\n\r\nbecoming  more and more technology driven.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, we will help them to cross the market gate, because\r\n\r\nthe market today is expanding, not just in Singapore, not\r\n\r\njust in South East Asia, but in the Asia Pacific.  But in\r\n\r\norder  for  them  to cross the technology  gate  and  the\r\n\r\nmarket gate, they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  also  be  able to bridge the gap  between  the  two\r\n\r\ngates.   Because, today, if we look at the market,  there\r\n\r\nis  a  time lag in the way the industry is able  to  take\r\n\r\nfull advantage of advances in technology.  So the way  to\r\n\r\nbridge the gap between the technology and market gates is\r\n\r\nwhat we call the \"bridge of innovation\".  And that is the\r\n\r\nreason  why  two  years  ago, the ENV  launched  the  IES\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked what is the response to the IES\r\n\r\nprogramme.   I must say that the response has  been  most\r\n\r\nencouraging.   Over the last 18 months  or  so,  we  have\r\n\r\nreceived 40 applications, and 10 of them have been  at  a\r\n\r\ncost  of  about  $2.6 million; another 12 are  now  under\r\n\r\nevaluation   and  they  cover  a  very  wide   scope   of\r\n\r\nactivities.  And we hope that, over time, we will be able\r\n\r\nto  continue  to  work closely with the  industry  or  3P\r\n\r\npartners to strengthen this bridge of innovation, so that\r\n\r\nour industry can cross the technology gate and the market\r\n\r\ngate successfully and become a regional leader.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even though environmental sustainability is a\r\n\r\nprimary  focus of SGP 2012 and that economic growth  will\r\n\r\nbe one of the priorities of the ENV as the lead agency, I\r\n\r\nwant  to  say that we are not stopping at two, because  a\r\n\r\nwin-win  outcome  for  environmental  sustainability  and\r\n\r\neconomic growth through industry development is good  but\r\n\r\ninsufficient.   We want to go beyond that.   We  want  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that SGP 2012 will also contribute to  social\r\n\r\nprogress  in  Singapore.  What do we mean by  that?    We\r\n\r\nbelieve that employment is the best way of sharing wealth\r\n\r\nand  the  most  dignified  way of  sustaining  broadbased\r\n\r\nsocial progress.  In that regard, I agree fully with what\r\n\r\nMdm Halimah mentioned two days ago in this House that  we\r\n\r\nhave to change our mindset.  And this changing of mindset\r\n\r\nis not just for workers, but for the employers as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall Mdm Halimah mentioned in this House that\r\n\r\nshe hoped that more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployers  would pay greater attention to job enhancement\r\n\r\nand  job  redesign.   I think that is  a  very  important\r\n\r\nstatement that I hope everyone of us would take note  of.\r\n\r\nTake  ENV, for example.  We are both an employer and  the\r\n\r\nlead  agency in the SGP 2012.  As an employer, we have  a\r\n\r\nprogramme whereby we allow our workers, who are more than\r\n\r\n62   years  old,  to  continue  working  as  daily  rated\r\n\r\nemployees (DREs).  In fact, right now, more than  11%  of\r\n\r\nour  DREs, or over 100 of them, are workers who are  more\r\n\r\nthan  62  years old.  What we do, basically, is  to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that they remain healthy and productive.   In  that\r\n\r\nway, they can live a life more meaningfully.  And yet, at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  we  believe,  as  the  lead  agency  in\r\n\r\nSingapore for SGP 2012, that there is a lot that needs to\r\n\r\nbe done to redesign the jobs in the environmental sector,\r\n\r\nso  that  more  Singaporeans  will  find  the  jobs  more\r\n\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot promise Singaporeans that the\r\n\r\nenvironmental sector will offer them easy jobs  and  good\r\n\r\npay.   But what we can promise them is that we are  doing\r\n\r\neverything that we can to make sure that every  job  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  good job with good pay.  So, how to turn  an  easy\r\n\r\njob,  lousy  pay, to a good job with good pay is  through\r\n\r\njob  redesign, and that is what the ENV is doing.  Today,\r\n\r\nwe   set   up  various  skills  standard  committees   in\r\n\r\ncollaboration   with   the  industry.    Our   intention,\r\n\r\nbasically, is to redesign key jobs in the key sectors  in\r\n\r\nthe  environmental sector, so that, hopefully, over time,\r\n\r\nas  we pursue the objective in Singapore Green Plan 2012,\r\n\r\nwe  would  not  only  be able to achieve  sustainability,\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  but, at the same time, social  progress\r\n\r\nthrough employment creation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me end by saying briefly something that I\r\n\r\nhave gone through recently.  I am a very keen golfer and,\r\n\r\nfrom  time to time, I play golf with friends and we  have\r\n\r\nsmall  bets, at every hole, $1-$2.  There was one  day  I\r\n\r\nplayed very well on hole No. 1.  I par that hole, and  my\r\n\r\nflight  mates did not say anything.   One of  them  said,\r\n\r\n\"It  is all right.  MOT.\"  I looked at him and said, \"MOT\r\n\r\n- Ministry of Transport.\"  I said, \"No, I am from ENV.  I\r\n\r\nam not from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOT.\"   He  said, \"No, I am referring to something  else.\r\n\r\nIt  does  not matter.\"  I went to hole No. 2.   I  played\r\n\r\nwell again.  This time I bogeyed and I played well again.\r\n\r\nThe  same  guy  said the same thing -  MOT.   And  I  was\r\n\r\nwondering what he was talking about. Finally, I  came  to\r\n\r\nhole  No. 7.  I was playing well in the first six  holes.\r\n\r\nAt every hole, he said \"MOT\".  When I came to hole No. 7,\r\n\r\nI  fumbled.   I hit a triple bogey, and he  laughed.   He\r\n\r\nsaid, \"I told you so  -   MOT.\"  I said, \"Please tell me,\r\n\r\nwhat is MOT?\"  He said, \"Ah, it is a matter of time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think if we look at nation building, it is\r\n\r\nthe same thing.  When we were doing well, many people out\r\n\r\nthere  said,  \"Look,  it is a matter  of  time  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore economy will run into problems.\"  When we  were\r\n\r\nenjoying full employment, there were people out there who\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Look,  the Singapore growth cannot be  sustained.\r\n\r\nThe  full employment cannot be sustained.  It is a matter\r\n\r\nof time this will happen.\"  So, this has happened.  These\r\n\r\npeople out there will be smiling and saying, \"I told  you\r\n\r\nso  -  MOT.\"  So, what do we do?  At hole No. 7, when  my\r\n\r\npartner  said,  \"MOT\", I had three  options.   The  first\r\n\r\noption  is,  I  concede, give up the rest  of  the  game,\r\n\r\naccept  that  I am a lousy golfer and play  triple  bogey\r\n\r\nevery hole.  Or I can try to be a good player, play safe,\r\n\r\ndo not take chances any more, go for double bogey, go for\r\n\r\nbogey,  do not go for par, play safe so that I would  not\r\n\r\nlose.   Or  I can try to play like Tiger Woods who  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat  player, play to win, never mind the triple  bogey,\r\n\r\ncontinue  to go for par, go for bogey, better  still  for\r\n\r\nbirdie, so that I can make up for that triple bogey.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me say that as far as the implementation of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Green  Plan 2012  is  concerned,  we  are\r\n\r\nplaying  to win.  We are not taking a defensive  approach\r\n\r\ntowards the implementation of this plan.  We are going on\r\n\r\nthe  offensive  to  make  sure that  the  environment  of\r\n\r\nSingapore will be sustainable for the long term,  and  we\r\n\r\nwill  make  sure  that  our environmental  industry  will\r\n\r\nbecome  a  regional  leader  to  contribute  to  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.   At the same time, we will make sure  that  this\r\n\r\nindustry will provide more good jobs\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith good pay, so that more Singaporeans can benefit from\r\n\r\nthe  social angle of the implementation of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGreen Plan 2012.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, looking after the\r\n\r\nenvironment is not solely the job of any one  party.   As\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Green Plan 2012 has aptly put  it,  \"close\r\n\r\npartnership among the people, private and public  sectors\r\n\r\nis  absolutely  crucial  to  forging  a  nation  that  is\r\n\r\nenvironmentally aware and responsible.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked what the Ministry can do to\r\n\r\nsupport    green   community   groups.    To    encourage\r\n\r\nenvironmental  partnership and  ownership  among  the  3P\r\n\r\nsectors, the National Environment Agency (NEA) had set up\r\n\r\na  3P  partnership fund last year.  The fund is available\r\n\r\nfor  partnership efforts between NEA and its 3P partners.\r\n\r\nNEA  is  committed to set aside $750,000  each  year  for\r\n\r\nthese projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our effort to forge partnership with the 3P\r\n\r\nsector,  we are always looking for ways to get closer  to\r\n\r\nthem.  An example of our effort to get closer to them  is\r\n\r\nthe  restructuring of our NEA regional offices.   On  1st\r\n\r\nMarch  this  year,  NEA  restructured  its  previous  six\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Health District Offices into five  regional\r\n\r\noffices  with boundaries that match the CDCs.  This  way,\r\n\r\nwe  can work closer with our public sector partners,  the\r\n\r\nCDCs and the Town Councils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another effort towards building a green community\r\n\r\nwas  the  setting  up  of  the environmental  corner  for\r\n\r\nchildren  at  the Woodlands Regional Library in  November\r\n\r\nlast year.  While the public sector has an important role\r\n\r\nto play in building a green community, the private sector\r\n\r\nhas an equally important, if not more important, role  to\r\n\r\nplay.   We have several projects with the private  sector\r\n\r\nthat  I  want to mention.  One example is the responsible\r\n\r\ncare   programme  by  the  Singapore  Chemical   Industry\r\n\r\nCouncil, which spells out the Council's commitment to the\r\n\r\npublic   to   continually   improve   its   environmental\r\n\r\noperations.  Another example is a project\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  Bayer.   Bayer  has  a  Young  Environmental  Envoy\r\n\r\nProgramme.   Under this programme, selected students  are\r\n\r\nsent  to Bayer's headquarters in Leverkusen, Germany,  to\r\n\r\nlearn  about  environmental  problems.   Another  private\r\n\r\nsector  organisation I would like to mention is the  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  and  Shanghai Banking Corporation.  They have  been\r\n\r\nworking with students and youths on environmental  issues\r\n\r\nfor a long time under their Care for Nature Programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having mentioned public and private sector\r\n\r\norganisations  and  the  important  roles  they  play  in\r\n\r\nbuilding a green community, I would like now to  move  on\r\n\r\nto  the  last, but definitely not the least, P,  ie,  the\r\n\r\npeople's sector.  People's sector organisations, be  they\r\n\r\nNGOs   or   grassroots  organisations,   are   especially\r\n\r\nimportant  in  getting heartlanders to be environmentally\r\n\r\nfriendly.   I  would  like to mention two  programmes  we\r\n\r\nhave.   One  is  the  Dengue Prevention  Volunteer  Group\r\n\r\nProgramme,  under  which grassroots organisation  members\r\n\r\nare  trained on basic information on dengue fever and how\r\n\r\nit  is  transmitted and how it can be  prevented.    They\r\n\r\ncheck their neighbourhoods for our agencies.  An NGO that\r\n\r\nhas  offered  its volunteers to play an  active  role  in\r\n\r\nenvironmental protection is the Waterways Watch  Society.\r\n\r\nIts  members  undertake  weekly boat  patrols  along  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  River and report any sighting of pollution  to\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another movement the NEA has started, in trying to\r\n\r\nget heartlanders to be more environmentally friendly,  is\r\n\r\nthe  Litter Free Movement.  The Litter Free Movement  was\r\n\r\nlaunched  last  year when those attending outdoor  events\r\n\r\nwere  asked  not to leave their litter behind  when  they\r\n\r\nleave the place after the event is over.  It started with\r\n\r\na  pilot  project at the National Day Parade.  And  since\r\n\r\nthen,  this  Movement  has been taken  to  more  than  20\r\n\r\noutdoor events.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, in looking after the environment, we\r\n\r\nhave many parties involved.  Usually, when we think about\r\n\r\nreaching out to environmentally active\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommitted people, we think about young people wearing  T-shirts  saying \"Save the World\".  In Singapore,  we  have\r\n\r\ncarried  the  message to all sectors.   Even  accountants\r\n\r\nhave  joined  the environment protection movement.   Last\r\n\r\nweek,  I  was  at  the  function of  the  Association  of\r\n\r\nChartered  Certified Accountants.  They were handing  out\r\n\r\nSingapore  Environmental Reporting Awards  to  companies.\r\n\r\nSIA  won  the  award at the function.  Today, accountants\r\n\r\nare   auditing   more   than  300  companies   on   their\r\n\r\nenvironmental performance.  All these bode well  for  the\r\n\r\nenvironment  and we should continue to work  together  to\r\n\r\nbuild   a   sustainable  environment  that  many  further\r\n\r\ngenerations can live, work and play in.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, there is a cut on\r\n\r\nbirds  and  crows,  and  they can talk  about  eagle  and\r\n\r\nbirdies!   My  cut is on global and regional cooperation.\r\n\r\nSo, I will go straight to MOT and save some time!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environment, Sir, knows no boundaries. As the\r\n\r\nMinister has said just now that there was still some haze\r\n\r\naffecting our PSI, but my own observation is that we  had\r\n\r\nless  last  year.   Was  it because  of  better  regional\r\n\r\ncooperation  on  environmental  matters?   And  will  the\r\n\r\nsituation  last?   Now that Singapore has  drawn  a  very\r\n\r\nimpressive  experience in terms of urban development  and\r\n\r\nenvironmental management, what are our plans to share the\r\n\r\nexperience  with  the region and the world?   Singapore's\r\n\r\nstrength  lies in the ability to deal with  the  host  of\r\n\r\nenvironmental  sustainability  challenges  in  the   city\r\n\r\ndevelopment context, be it water, waste management or air\r\n\r\nquality.   So  the  expertise we have acquired  over  the\r\n\r\nyears would be relevant to other developing countries  in\r\n\r\ntheir  efforts  to  address challenges brought  about  by\r\n\r\nurbanisation  and  development. So, in  addressing  these\r\n\r\nenvironmental   sustainability   challenges,   how   does\r\n\r\nSingapore   see  the  process  of  sharing  with   fellow\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries its own experience,  especially  in\r\n\r\nthe  field of urban environmental management?  How do  we\r\n\r\nintend to do so and what would be our priority?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, while we share with others our experiences,\r\n\r\nwho do we learn from to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeet our own needs?  Is it everybody, somebody, nobody or\r\n\r\nanybody?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, you have 15 minutes left for\r\n\r\nthe whole Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, Mr Zainul asked what is the\r\n\r\nprogress  in the area of regional haze.  Since  the  last\r\n\r\nhaze episode in 1997, the ASEAN nations have been working\r\n\r\nvery  closely.   In fact, last year, we decided  to  take\r\n\r\nanother  step  forward in a landmark  regional  agreement\r\n\r\nknown  as  the  ASEAN  Agreement  on  Transboundary  Haze\r\n\r\nPollution.  This Agreement will require six countries  to\r\n\r\nratify  before  it  can come into force.   So  far,  five\r\n\r\ncountries  have done so  -  Brunei, Malaysia,  Singapore,\r\n\r\nVietnam and Myanmar.  And we hope that at least one  more\r\n\r\ncountry would ratify this agreement, so that we can bring\r\n\r\nit into force before the end of this year.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul asked whether we are less affected by haze\r\n\r\nthis  year, is it because of this regional collaboration?\r\n\r\nI  hope so, but I cannot be certain as yet.  I would  say\r\n\r\nthat the next time when we go through another El Nino,  I\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to see what happens.  If we  are  able  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  the  next El Nino better than the one  in  1997,\r\n\r\nthen  I  would have the confidence to inform  the  Member\r\n\r\nthat, indeed, the regional collaboration is working.  But\r\n\r\nuntil then, I would say that we do whatever we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul also asked what we can do to share our\r\n\r\nexpertise  and  experience with the  regional  countries.\r\n\r\nSir,  the ASEAN Environment Ministers met again late last\r\n\r\nyear  to  discuss  follow-ups  to  the  World  Summit  on\r\n\r\nSustainable Development.  We came to the conclusion  that\r\n\r\neven  though  the ASEAN countries (10 member  countries),\r\n\r\nwith  very  different backgrounds and in  very  different\r\n\r\nstages of development, there are certain areas and common\r\n\r\nfactors  that apply to all of us.  One common  factor  is\r\n\r\nthe  whole  process of urbanisation.  In fact,  the  UN's\r\n\r\nprojection for 2030, which is about 30 years from now, is\r\n\r\nthat in the Asia Pacific, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopulation  in urban areas will double from 1.35  billion\r\n\r\nin  the year 2000 to 2.6 billion by the year 2030.   This\r\n\r\nwill pose enormous burden on the city environment because\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  growing demands for  water,  energy  and\r\n\r\nproblems   with   sanitation   drainage,   solid    waste\r\n\r\nmanagement, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the ASEAN Environment Ministers decided\r\n\r\nthat  we  should jointly mount a regional  initiative  on\r\n\r\nwhat we call \"Sustainable Cities\".  The idea is to create\r\n\r\na  platform  so that every one of us - no matter  whether\r\n\r\nyou  are  from Singapore, Malaysia or Indonesia,  and  no\r\n\r\nmatter  whether  you are from a small or a  big  country,\r\n\r\nbecause  small and big countries have cities too  -  come\r\n\r\ntogether  to  promote sharing of ideas and  know-how,  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  can learn and work with each other.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nthis  partnership  will involve the participation  beyond\r\n\r\nthe  ASEAN cities.  In fact, our ASEAN+3 partners (Japan,\r\n\r\nChina  and Korea) have indicated their interest  to  take\r\n\r\npart in this programme as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What NEA is doing is that we are now designated by\r\n\r\nASEAN  to  play a leading role in this Working  Group  on\r\n\r\nSustainable  Cities.   NEA  had,  in  fact,  submitted  a\r\n\r\nconcept  proposal,  and this was endorsed  by  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nEnvironment Ministers last month in Cambodia.  We are now\r\n\r\ngoing into the process of implementation.  So I would say\r\n\r\nthat  this would really be a very useful platform for  us\r\n\r\nto  share our experience with our fellow members of ASEAN\r\n\r\nand beyond.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we discuss on sustainable cities, one issue\r\n\r\nthat  often comes about is the issue of water.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nsome of these ASEAN Ministers asked us this question - as\r\n\r\nwe move towards NEWater and desalination water - would we\r\n\r\nend  up overly dependent on energy, because all these are\r\n\r\nvery energy-intensive?  In fact, that was the point, if I\r\n\r\nremember,  brought  up  by Mr  Iswaran  earlier.   And  I\r\n\r\napologise for not replying to him earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to respond to that point - yes, desalination\r\n\r\ndoes   take   up  more  energy.   It  is  true,   because\r\n\r\ndesalination is more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenergy-intensive.  And precisely because of that, we have\r\n\r\ndecided to diversify our sources of supply.  That is  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  we have four taps.  Within these four  taps,\r\n\r\ndesalination by the year 2005 will only account for  less\r\n\r\nthan  10% of our water supply system.  We are fully aware\r\n\r\nthat  we should not become overly dependent on energy  in\r\n\r\nour water supply, and that is the reason why we are going\r\n\r\nfor NEWater, which is a lot less energy-intensive.  To be\r\n\r\nprecise,  the energy needed for NEWater is only one-fifth\r\n\r\nthat  of desalination.  Such experience in becoming  more\r\n\r\nself-sufficient  in water supply without becoming  overly\r\n\r\ndependent  on energy is something that we can share  with\r\n\r\nour  fellow members as well under the sustainable  cities\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, it is a nuisance to attend to\r\n\r\nbird nuisance in Singapore.  First, you must identify the\r\n\r\nbird that is causing nuisance.  Then, you need to know at\r\n\r\nwhich location is the bird causing nuisance.  If it is  a\r\n\r\ncrow, the Environment Ministry will attend to it.  If  it\r\n\r\nis  not a crow, then it is under the jurisdiction of  the\r\n\r\nNational  Development  Ministry.   But  if  the  nuisance\r\n\r\nhappens  at a HDB common property, the town council  will\r\n\r\nhave to attend to it.  If it is along the ENV drains, ENV\r\n\r\nwill  solve  the  problem.  But if the bird  is  creating\r\n\r\nnuisance  on  the  trees along the road divider,  LTA  is\r\n\r\nresponsible for the nuisance.  Of course, if the bird  is\r\n\r\ncausing  nuisance  in  your  house,  then  that  is  your\r\n\r\nproblem!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need a one-stop agency to resolve all the\r\n\r\nbird  nuisance in Singapore.  May I ask the Minister what\r\n\r\nis the Ministry doing to resolve this birdie problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, birds are a part of\r\n\r\nnature  and a part of our eco-system.  We must  learn  to\r\n\r\nlive with nature and see it as a thing of beauty and  not\r\n\r\na  nuisance.   After  all, these things  of  nature  have\r\n\r\nlearned  to  live with us.  So, we should learn  to  live\r\n\r\nwith them.  It would be a sad day when we do not have any\r\n\r\nmore living creatures in our environment because we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngo out to eliminate them because they are a nuisance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we should see this bird nuisance in its correct\r\n\r\nperspective.   Is  there a threat to public  health?   If\r\n\r\nthere  is,  then I can assure the House that my  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill not hesitate to remove the threat.  And that is just\r\n\r\nnot  limited  to  birds; the same goes  for  any  animal,\r\n\r\nmineral or vegetable.  In the case of crows, for example,\r\n\r\nmy Ministry mounted a major culling programme because the\r\n\r\ncrow  population  has grown to such overwhelming  numbers\r\n\r\nwhich  make them a threat to public health.  Crows, being\r\n\r\nlarge  birds, have a high capacity of carrying  pathogens\r\n\r\nand  when there are so many of them around, they  pose  a\r\n\r\nthreat to public health.  We would not say the same about\r\n\r\nmynahs  or  sparrows that we see around us  today.   They\r\n\r\npose no threat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the convenience of the public, all\r\n\r\nfeedback and enquiries about nuisance caused by birds can\r\n\r\nbe  directed to NEA, who will act as a single agency.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, the public should refrain  from  feeding\r\n\r\nbirds  as  that  will  only attract them  to  return  and\r\n\r\ncongregate in large numbers at one location.   Those  who\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  feeding the birds is an  act  of  kindness\r\n\r\nshould  take heart that these wild birds have the ability\r\n\r\nto find their food themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Teo, do you want to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister  and the Minister of State for their sustainable\r\n\r\nanswers  which,  I  believe, will be  recyclable  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Ang Mong Seng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code LC 1500.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, last year, I asked the Minister\r\n\r\nhow many crows were there in Singapore and he said it was\r\n\r\nabout  120,000,  to the astonishment of  everybody.   But\r\n\r\nlast  Sunday,  when  I  went to a hawker  centre  for  my\r\n\r\nbreakfast,  I  saw a lot of crows flying around.   So,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister how effective was his crow\r\n\r\nculling campaign.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, I understand that in\r\n\r\nChinese,  there are two types of crows.  But with  regard\r\n\r\nto  flying crows, NEA has reduced the crow population  in\r\n\r\n2002  through  culling  by  more  than  two-thirds.   The\r\n\r\nestimated  population  is  now about  40,000,  down  from\r\n\r\n120,000.  We will continue with our culling efforts.   An\r\n\r\nexpert  from  NUS has suggested that the crow  population\r\n\r\nshould  be  brought down to 10,000.  We will continue  to\r\n\r\nconsult  the experts and our culling effort to bring  the\r\n\r\ncrow population down to a manageable number.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many public places, eg, East Coast Park, are now\r\n\r\nrelatively  crow-free.   Crow nuisance  areas  have  also\r\n\r\ndropped.  In Ang Mo Kio, they have dropped by about  80%,\r\n\r\nfrom about 1,000 areas to 200 areas.  East Coast Park has\r\n\r\ndropped  from  about 200 areas to 10  areas.   Complaints\r\n\r\nhave  also  dropped.  In 2000, there was  an  average  of\r\n\r\nabout 340 complaints per month.  Now, this has dropped to\r\n\r\nabout  200  complaints a month.

The  Committee\r\n\r\nrealises that if Singapore were to scale greater  heights\r\n\r\nin  future,  the future working population must  be  more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  than the past generations.   Mr  Raymond\r\n\r\nLim,  Minister  of  State in charge of  entrepreneurship,\r\n\r\nrecognises  that  schools  are  the  cradles  of   future\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.  He also mentioned that some  schools  are\r\n\r\nalready  actively encouraging students to operate  stalls\r\n\r\nin an attempt to promote this spirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while running stalls teaches the basics of\r\n\r\nbusiness, I see entrepreneurship as being more than that.\r\n\r\nTo  me, being entrepreneurial means the ability to create\r\n\r\nopportunities  when  none existed.   It  also  means  the\r\n\r\nforesight to seize opportunities when these are  not  yet\r\n\r\nrecognised  by others.  Besides, we require the  tenacity\r\n\r\nof  a bulldog to bring that opportunity to fruition.   To\r\n\r\ntry to turn out entrepreneurs by the busloads through our\r\n\r\nschools will be unrealistic.  Nonetheless, I think it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that  we try to inculcate the habit  of  being\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  in  our young people.   Hopefully,  they\r\n\r\nwill become more creative and innovative when they become\r\n\r\nadults.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another desirable outcome, Sir, will be the\r\n\r\nappreciation of the difficulties of striking out on one's\r\n\r\nown.  If more of our people share this appreciation, then\r\n\r\nwe   will   be   more  likely  to  look   at   successful\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs not with envy but with admiration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a big step has already been taken by MOE to\r\n\r\npromote creativity through the JC curriculum reform aimed\r\n\r\nat  inculcating  thinking skills  versus  rote  learning.\r\n\r\nThis  was  debated extensively in this House in  November\r\n\r\nlast  year.   The  new curriculum will be  introduced  in\r\n\r\n2006.   As  this  is the most significant change  in  our\r\n\r\neducation policy in recent years, I suggest that we allow\r\n\r\nthese changes to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork  their  way through the system before  embarking  on\r\n\r\nmore radical changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, MOE has implicitly adopted\r\n\r\nthe  strategy of introducing creativity in our  education\r\n\r\nsystem  by  allowing  the effect  of  the  JC  curriculum\r\n\r\nchanges  to percolate itself through the system from  JCs\r\n\r\nto  secondary schools to primary schools.   To  me,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis is a passive approach and would take much longer.  I\r\n\r\nwould   urge  a  more  proactive  approach  to  introduce\r\n\r\ncreative  thinking in our schools.  I  suggest  that  MOE\r\n\r\ncarry out a review of the PSLE curriculum as well as  the\r\n\r\n\"O\"  level curriculum concurrently with the JC curriculum\r\n\r\nwith  a  view to introducing thinking skills as early  as\r\n\r\npossible.   At the primary level, one way is to  increase\r\n\r\nthe  attention  pupils received by the  teachers  through\r\n\r\nreducing class size, a subject which I will come back  to\r\n\r\nin my next cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should lay a strong foundation for creative\r\n\r\nlearning  as  early as possible so that the vision  of  a\r\n\r\nmore entrepreneurial Singapore could be realised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have a total of 365 minutes for\r\n\r\nthis amendment.  Mdm Halimah.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, we have a robust\r\n\r\neducation  system which is responsive to  changing  needs\r\n\r\nand  continuously strive to prepare our students both for\r\n\r\nthe  labour  market  and  in their  role  as  responsible\r\n\r\ncitizens  in  our society.  There are, of  course,  areas\r\n\r\nwhere we are concerned about when we hope that sufficient\r\n\r\nresources  will  continue to be allocated  and  attention\r\n\r\ncontinues to be focused.  This is the impression that our\r\n\r\neducation   system  is  elitist  and  the  concern   over\r\n\r\nstreaming  and  its impact on our children's  self-esteem\r\n\r\nand self-confidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand the principles involved. Different\r\n\r\nchildren  have  different  abilities,  and  the  existing\r\n\r\nsystem  is meant to reduce wastage which was much greater\r\n\r\nin the past.  Many of us have visited the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nITE and are impressed with the changes there compared  to\r\n\r\nthe  old  VITB.  Examples like this will help to  enhance\r\n\r\npeople's  confidence in our school system and generate  a\r\n\r\nbetter understanding of streaming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now come to the point which was\r\n\r\nmentioned by Dr Wang Kai Yuen.  I support his views and I\r\n\r\nalso  want to say that the review that is done should  be\r\n\r\ncontinued with regard to primary education as well.   And\r\n\r\nI  also note, recently, that the Ministry has conducted a\r\n\r\nreview of pre-school education.  To me, such a review  of\r\n\r\nprimary education is not only timely but also logical, as\r\n\r\npre-school  education  is very  much  linked  to  primary\r\n\r\neducation and one of its aims must be to prepare children\r\n\r\nfor primary school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of us have also argued in this House that\r\n\r\nthere  is a need to better align primary school education\r\n\r\nwith the revised curriculum in the upper secondary school\r\n\r\nwith   its  new  focus  on  developing  better  thinking,\r\n\r\ncommunication and other process skills.  If  the  primary\r\n\r\nschool  review is in the pipeline, I would like  to  make\r\n\r\ntwo  specific suggestions which I hope can  be  taken  on\r\n\r\nboard  when  the Ministry makes its review.   Firstly,  I\r\n\r\nwould   like  to  request  that  the  Ministry   consider\r\n\r\nintroducing  a single session for primary schools.   This\r\n\r\nhas  already  been  done for secondary  schools  and  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  are  obvious.  Teachers and students  are  less\r\n\r\nharried,  compared  to  a situation  where  students  and\r\n\r\nteachers from both sessions have to hastily make way  for\r\n\r\neach other.  With only one session, students and teachers\r\n\r\ncould  also  spend more time interacting with each  other\r\n\r\noutside  school  hours  and can use  the  classrooms  and\r\n\r\nfacilities   for  enrichment  programmes  or   additional\r\n\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to support Dr Wang Kai Yuen\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry should consider reducing the class size\r\n\r\nfor  primary  schools.  This is a matter which  has  been\r\n\r\nraised  many  times before but which had not gained  much\r\n\r\nsupport.   But  I  am aware that, in the review  of  pre-school  education,  one  suggestion  is  to  reduce   the\r\n\r\nstudent/teacher ratio.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis seems to indicate that the Ministry acknowledges the\r\n\r\nimportance  of smaller class sizes in enhancing  teaching\r\n\r\neffectiveness  and delivery.  I am also reminded  of  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of  a  small class size.  If you  look  at  the\r\n\r\ngifted programme, the class sizes are smaller, which is a\r\n\r\nfurther  testimony of the benefits of small class  sizes.\r\n\r\nWith this small class size, more students will benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is up, Mdm Halimah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nSingapore has an excellent reputation for being a  centre\r\n\r\nof  excellence  for education.  As Singapore  strives  to\r\n\r\ngrow  the education sector as an economic driver, we have\r\n\r\nrelaxed  our  education  policy to  enable  more  foreign\r\n\r\nstudents  to  study  in Singapore.  By  allowing  foreign\r\n\r\nstudents to study in Singapore, we will be able to tap on\r\n\r\na   larger  talent  pool.   However,  liberalisation   of\r\n\r\npolicies can also cause unintended problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the major issues that have arisen as a result\r\n\r\nof  the relaxed entry of foreign students are as follows.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  we  have  the  issue of  accompanying  mothers.\r\n\r\nCertain students are allowed to have mothers accompanying\r\n\r\nthem  when  they  study in Singapore.   There  have  been\r\n\r\nreports  that  these  mothers  have  deviated  from   the\r\n\r\nintended  role to look after their children and care  for\r\n\r\nthem  while they study in Singapore.  Instead, many  have\r\n\r\ntaken  up  jobs  in health clubs, massage parlours,  etc.\r\n\r\nSome  have also used the excuse of sending their children\r\n\r\nhere  for  study  to come to Singapore  when  their  real\r\n\r\nintention was actually to find a job in Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nmay result in social problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have the issue of ensuring standards in\r\n\r\neducation.   There  have been Chinese students  who  have\r\n\r\nstudied  in private educational institutions in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  when  they  went back to China, they  claimed  that,\r\n\r\ndespite  spending their time studying in Singapore,  they\r\n\r\nhave not learned to speak proper English and did not have\r\n\r\na good programme.  This\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  damage  our  reputation as a centre  of  educational\r\n\r\nexcellence.   However, I have had very positive  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom   Chinese  students  who  have  studied  in   public\r\n\r\neducational  institutions in  Singapore.   Many  of  them\r\n\r\nspeak fluent English and have won many prizes.  They  not\r\n\r\nonly    perform   well   academically,   but   are   also\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial.  I had the chance to see business  plans\r\n\r\nwritten  by  students from Shanghai, Dalian and  Qingdao.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  was very impressed by their business plans  which\r\n\r\nwere written in impeccable English.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we grow our educational services as an\r\n\r\neconomic  driver,  we  must  ensure  that  standards  are\r\n\r\nmaintained  and  our  reputation is  preserved.   We  can\r\n\r\nperhaps   learn  from  one  of  the  public   educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions  in  Singapore which  has  won  respect  and\r\n\r\npraise  from students in Singapore.  In China,  they  say\r\n\r\nthat there are three universities in Singapore - NUS, NTU\r\n\r\nand   Ngee   Ann  University.   What  they  are  actually\r\n\r\nreferring to is Ngee Ann Polytechnic.  The students  tell\r\n\r\nme that Ngee Ann Polytechnic has established an extremely\r\n\r\ngood  reputation  as a tertiary educational  institution.\r\n\r\nNAP  sets  very stringent entry requirements and students\r\n\r\nhave  to  sit for an entrance examination and  those  who\r\n\r\nsucceed  in  the entrance examination have to undergo  an\r\n\r\nindividual  interview  with  the  panel  from  Ngee   Ann\r\n\r\nPolytechnic,  lasting  about 15  to  20  minutes.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult, only the very best get into Ngee Ann Polytechnic.\r\n\r\nStudents  are also known to have given up places  in  top\r\n\r\nuniversities   in  China  for  a  place   in   Ngee   Ann\r\n\r\nPolytechnic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to ask the Minister is whether the\r\n\r\nMinistry   would  review  this  attempt  to  expand   the\r\n\r\neducational sector by putting in place, perhaps,  a  more\r\n\r\nstringent  standard, entrance examination,  or  streaming\r\n\r\ntest,  so  that we protect our reputation.  What measures\r\n\r\nwill  the Government take to try to balance the  need  to\r\n\r\ngrow  the  educational sector as an economic driver  and,\r\n\r\nyet,  ensure that Singapore's reputation as a  centre  of\r\n\r\nexcellence will not be tarnished?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto touch on a few topics today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst  of  all, is on class sizes which two Members  have\r\n\r\nbrought up.  While the availability of teachers may be  a\r\n\r\nshort-term issue, can we at least try to experiment  with\r\n\r\nsmall  class sizes by applying a hybrid system?   We  can\r\n\r\nhave  average  class  sizes for some subjects,  and  then\r\n\r\nbreak  up  some for bigger classes and some  for  smaller\r\n\r\nclasses.   We  can  do  all  of  this  within  the   same\r\n\r\ncurriculum  time.  With this approach, we will  not  need\r\n\r\nmany more teachers because these things will average out.\r\n\r\nI  advocate small class sizes for slower children so that\r\n\r\nthey  will have a better chance of catching up with their\r\n\r\npeers  as  they get closer attention.  And  we  can  have\r\n\r\nbigger  class sizes than normal for faster children.   It\r\n\r\nwill  not be much loss for them because they do not  need\r\n\r\nmuch attention anyway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I support the issue of single session\r\n\r\nprimary  schools.   I suggest that we start  with  a  few\r\n\r\npilot  schools and, if it is successful, we can implement\r\n\r\na  roadmap  for  expansion to all schools.   With  single\r\n\r\nsession schools, we will have the opportunity to  have  a\r\n\r\nmuch  more  flexible curriculum and to spend  extra  time\r\n\r\nwith students who need more attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue is on streaming. While I do\r\n\r\nnot fully agree with the streaming system, especially the\r\n\r\nway  it  is  being implemented, I will not challenge  the\r\n\r\nsystem this year because I know that I will get the  same\r\n\r\nanswer.   I would like to, instead, focus on what success\r\n\r\nwe  have had with the system.  If we really mean  and  do\r\n\r\nwhat  we  advocate  in the system of  streaming  children\r\n\r\naccording to their learning abilities, then we should see\r\n\r\nresults  of  the  focused effort to let  slower  children\r\n\r\ncatch up with their peers.  I therefore would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to share with the House the results of  the\r\n\r\nsystem and, in particular, the following statistics.  How\r\n\r\nmany EM3 students are transferred to EM2 at the Primary 6\r\n\r\nlevel?   How  many EM3 students finally  get  a  tertiary\r\n\r\nqualification?  How many EM3 students make it to the  'O'\r\n\r\nlevels?   How  many Normal (Technical) students  make  it\r\n\r\nback to the Express Stream?  And\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow  many Normal (Technical) students make it to tertiary\r\n\r\neducation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I also support the drive for\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship and the suggestions made by some of  the\r\n\r\nMembers.  In addition to what has been suggested, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to suggest that we have entrepreneurship as  a  CCA\r\n\r\nactivity   in   secondary  schools.   Can   we   set   up\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  clubs,  like we  have  debating  clubs,\r\n\r\ngardening  clubs,  and so on?  The  NYAA  is  willing  to\r\n\r\nspearhead this project but we need MOE to agree that this\r\n\r\nwill be a recognised CCA activity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Education in Singapore is\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  one of the cornerstones from which  we  have\r\n\r\nbuilt our economy and great strides have indeed been made\r\n\r\nin  educating  our young.  The budget for  Education  has\r\n\r\nconsistently  remained  the  second  highest   Government\r\n\r\nspending.   Last  year,  the system  saw  major  proposed\r\n\r\nreforms  for  the  upper secondary/JC education  and  the\r\n\r\nuniversity sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes to be made to the upper\r\n\r\nsecondary/JC   education  to  inject   greater   breadth,\r\n\r\nflexibility and diversity into the curriculum has largely\r\n\r\nbeen welcomed by Singaporeans.  The proposed expansion of\r\n\r\nthe   university  sector  to  allow  among  others   more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to study at the local universities has  also\r\n\r\nbeen  viewed  positively.   A new  pre-school  programme,\r\n\r\ndeveloped by MOE with expert help, which teaches students\r\n\r\nto  play  activities, discovery and experiment  has  also\r\n\r\nbeen launched.  Amidst all these changes, there seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  a missing link as the Ministry has been silent on any\r\n\r\nimpending changes to be made to primary school education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like my parliamentary colleagues before me, I\r\n\r\nwould also like to ask the Minister if the Ministry  will\r\n\r\nbe  looking into revamping the primary school, as well as\r\n\r\nthe  lower  secondary education, so as to make  them  fit\r\n\r\ninto  pre-school  as well as the upper secondary  and  JC\r\n\r\neducation.  As I noted in the debate on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   upper  secondary/JC  education  review,   the   new\r\n\r\neducation  roadmap  on greater breadth,  flexibility  and\r\n\r\ndiversity should also be made available to those  in  the\r\n\r\nlower  secondary and primary schools so that all will  be\r\n\r\ncharting  a common course.  Many parents continue  to  be\r\n\r\nanguished  at  the mere thought that their children  will\r\n\r\npractically lose their childhood and the joy of childhood\r\n\r\nonce  they  enter  what  is generally  perceived  as  the\r\n\r\npressure-cooker Singapore education system  from  Primary\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the lines of the new pre-school programme,\r\n\r\nshould  not the primary school teaching methods  be  also\r\n\r\nchanged to give more weight to learning through activity,\r\n\r\ndiscovery  and  experiment  and  less  weight   on   rote\r\n\r\nlearning?   The  MOE  should also review  the  curriculum\r\n\r\ncontent and workload of primary school students to see if\r\n\r\nthe  content  can be further trimmed without  sacrificing\r\n\r\nquality  and  standard.   Again,  like  my  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues  before  me, I would  also  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  look  into the feasibility  of  introducing\r\n\r\nsingle  session primary schools because I have noted  how\r\n\r\nmy  children have benefited when their school turned from\r\n\r\na two session school to a single session school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the changes made to the pre-school, JC and\r\n\r\nuniversity  curriculum  to  allow  for  more  broad-based\r\n\r\neducation  and  nurturing thinking  skills  are,  indeed,\r\n\r\nfirst  steps  in  the right direction.   However,  change\r\n\r\nshould also be made equally upstream.  Hence, I urge  MOE\r\n\r\nnot  to  delay in looking at the equally needed  reforms,\r\n\r\nespecially for those in primary schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I sat last\r\n\r\nyear on the ERC Sub-committee on Enhancing Human Capital.\r\n\r\nThe  Workgroup  on Arts, Culture, Sports  and  Recreation\r\n\r\nnoted  that,  while our school system has  done  well  in\r\n\r\nscience,  technology and mathematics, there is an  urgent\r\n\r\nneed  to  pay  equal  attention to literature,  arts  and\r\n\r\nsports  education.   Further,  school  teachers  need  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  purpose of literature, arts  and  sports\r\n\r\neducation, less to help talented\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents  to  become artists or sportsmen,  but  more  to\r\n\r\nbuild   character   and   skills  to   understand   human\r\n\r\nrelationship  and  appreciate aesthetics,  to  nurture  a\r\n\r\nreceptive mindset for both the arts and sports and to  be\r\n\r\ncreative  individually.  Thus, our literature,  arts  and\r\n\r\nsports  education policy should be such that  every  one,\r\n\r\nnot  only  the talented few, is given the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose therefore that,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding the plans, when the Arts School  and  the\r\n\r\nSports  School  are targeted at nurturing and  developing\r\n\r\nthose  youngsters with the talent to make it to the  apex\r\n\r\nof  these  disciplines, we should place literature,  arts\r\n\r\nand  sports  as an essential part of school education  in\r\n\r\ngeneral.   I expect that the Minister will say  that  our\r\n\r\nchildren  do  currently have arts  and  sports  in  their\r\n\r\ncurriculum   and   give   us  examples   of   even   some\r\n\r\nneighbourhood schools which have showcased  band,  drama,\r\n\r\nsports, or other arts programmes and enumerate the number\r\n\r\nof teachers in each school trained in physical education.\r\n\r\nBut what I am talking about is the uniform delivery of  a\r\n\r\nquality curriculum in these two areas across all schools,\r\n\r\nand  the  development  and  appreciation  for  aesthetics\r\n\r\nthrough the learning of the arts and the love for sports,\r\n\r\nrather  than  an aversion that develops as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nbeing required to participate in some less than inspiring\r\n\r\nphysical  activity  programme, developing  the  love  for\r\n\r\nsports,  to  build  character, team  spirit  and  healthy\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have referred in passing to the subject of\r\n\r\nthe Sports School, I cannot but make the observation here\r\n\r\nas  well  that the announcement that the school will  not\r\n\r\naccept  Normal Stream students is sadly at odds with  all\r\n\r\nthat   we  have  been,  in  recent  times,  saying  about\r\n\r\nprofessing to value and to want to nurture diversity  and\r\n\r\nto  value  youngsters with different skills and  talents.\r\n\r\nThis   inability  to  get  beyond,  first  and  foremost,\r\n\r\nacademic   abilities  above  all,  will  cost   us   many\r\n\r\nyoungsters  with  different talents to fall  through  the\r\n\r\ncracks in our selection processes and criteria.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I wish to say something\r\n\r\nabout a subject which I am quite certain the Minister may\r\n\r\nbristle  at.  Streaming has been the bane of many parents\r\n\r\nand  students.   It  keeps popping  up  at  parliamentary\r\n\r\nsittings in one guise or another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I come to my main point, I wish to state\r\n\r\ncategorically   that  I  support  the  principle   behind\r\n\r\nstreaming.  The principle is that different students  are\r\n\r\ngifted  in  different ways.  A programme that  matches  a\r\n\r\nstudent to his or her aptitude will extract the best from\r\n\r\nhim,  compared  to  one that treats all  students  alike.\r\n\r\nThere  is a risk that an egalitarian approach could  dump\r\n\r\ndown  instead  of  level up, as some  schools  in  Europe\r\n\r\ntinged with socialist ideals have found.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not like the stigma that attaches to streaming.\r\n\r\nBut  I  support  the notion that, on the whole,  students\r\n\r\nshould  gain from it, however Orwellian this may be.   My\r\n\r\nproblem is not that there should not be any streaming  at\r\n\r\nall.  Instead, I think we need to have more streaming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the streaming we are familiar with has a\r\n\r\nbias   towards   the  upper  10-20  percentile   of   the\r\n\r\npopulation.    Indeed,   the   whole   issue   of   upper\r\n\r\nsecondary/JC  education  that  this  House  debated  last\r\n\r\nNovember  seems  to  give heavy  emphasis  to  those  who\r\n\r\nactually need less help, ie, the gifted and those in  the\r\n\r\nthrough-train system and the elite private schools.   Our\r\n\r\nscarce  manpower  resources make it imperative  that  the\r\n\r\nprecious  little we have be optimised so that,  from  the\r\n\r\nmixture, the cream will rise to become the future leaders\r\n\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about the bottom 10-20 percentile? This\r\n\r\ngroup  is  a far more needy group that would, of  course,\r\n\r\ndemand  proportionately more resources to help  than  the\r\n\r\naverage  student  group.   I  speak  especially  of   the\r\n\r\nLearning   Support   Programme,   which   is   an   early\r\n\r\nintervention programme designed to identify and help  the\r\n\r\nweaker  students  in  Primary  1  and  2.   Perhaps,  the\r\n\r\nresource issue is the key\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreason  why the LSC programme does not continue into  the\r\n\r\nmiddle and upper primary schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to look into how special\r\n\r\nprogrammes can be designed to help them.  In doing so,  I\r\n\r\nam  supporting  the notion of streaming.  However,  I  am\r\n\r\narguing not that it has gone too far but that it has  not\r\n\r\ngone  far  enough to make a difference to those who  need\r\n\r\nthe most help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports School recently drew flak from parents\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  principal's insistence that  applicants\r\n\r\nmust  be  at  least in EM2 to qualify.  This  is  another\r\n\r\ninstance  of inadequate streaming.  Streaming should  not\r\n\r\nbe confined to academic outcomes, but also recognise that\r\n\r\ntalent  has many, many forms.  Few are the ones  who  are\r\n\r\ngifted in multiple areas.  Since streaming is already  so\r\n\r\nentrenched  in  Singapore, why not go the whole  hog  and\r\n\r\npermit   the   Sports   School  or  similar   specialised\r\n\r\ninstitutions  to admit students talented  in  sports  but\r\n\r\nless gifted academically, but be more flexible about such\r\n\r\ncriteria?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, unlike Dr Amy Khor, I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should scrap the current streaming system  and\r\n\r\nreplace  it  with a subject-based system to maximise  the\r\n\r\npotential of each student.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at last year's Budget debate, I asked the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  consider exploring the idea  of  organising\r\n\r\nschools  based  on  subject,  by  replacing  the  current\r\n\r\nstreaming system, based on a cluster of subjects, to  one\r\n\r\nbased  on  individual subjects.  Students would  then  be\r\n\r\ngrouped  into different classes based on the marriage  of\r\n\r\nthe   individual  subjects.   This  would  allow  further\r\n\r\ncustomisation   of  learning,  and  further   allow   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of individual student's potential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note from news reports that ACS (Barker Road) has\r\n\r\nintroduced  the  concept of theme  classrooms  which  are\r\n\r\nsubject-focused.  Although this is only a  pilot  project\r\n\r\nof  grouping  classes according to the subject,  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is a positive first step forward.  Theme classrooms\r\n\r\ncould\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperhaps  one day become a leading model for our  national\r\n\r\nschool  system.   I  believe  that  besides  the  benefit\r\n\r\nmentioned  above,  this  system would  also  be  able  to\r\n\r\nsignificantly reduce the social stigma of  streaming.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask  the Minister  whether  he  has  any\r\n\r\nintention  to expand this pilot project to include  other\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue, Sir, which is associated with the\r\n\r\nstreaming   system,  is  the  decision  of   the   newly-established Singapore Sports School to admit only Express\r\n\r\nstream students.  I cannot understand the rationalisation\r\n\r\nwhy  selection  should  be based on academic  performance\r\n\r\nand,  in particular, only the Express stream.  Does  this\r\n\r\nnot  defeat the purpose of setting up a Sports School  in\r\n\r\nthe first place?  I request the Minister to clarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, on the subject\r\n\r\nof  holistic education, the thought that comes to my mind\r\n\r\nis  that  if  we  were to ask the school  principals  and\r\n\r\nteachers  today  how many of them have  spoken  to  their\r\n\r\nstudents about the impending war in 24 hours in  Iraq,  I\r\n\r\nam  not  so  sure  many school students  will  have  some\r\n\r\nforetaste of the story developing and shaping up  in  the\r\n\r\nMiddle East.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we spoke so much about the Economic Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  report.  A lot of effort has been put  in.   I\r\n\r\nwonder  how many principals and teachers are equipped  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  the important subject that will affect  them  in\r\n\r\nthe  next 15 years, because the Economic Review Committee\r\n\r\nreport is framed for the next 15 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as we are already very strong in our education\r\n\r\nsystem, I think the future really lies in how do we  make\r\n\r\nit  stronger and better.  It is no longer the science  of\r\n\r\neducation but rather the art of it.  I share Dr  Jennifer\r\n\r\nLee's  point with regard to how much more rounded we  can\r\n\r\nmake  our students to be in not only in the sciences  but\r\n\r\nalso in the arts and the humanities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the global economy is with us today, we are\r\n\r\nseeing  ourselves  getting involved  with  cross-cultural\r\n\r\ncontacts and issues.  I am not very sure that the way  in\r\n\r\nwhich\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  students are placed, the subjects that  they  learn,\r\n\r\nand  the  inter-personal relationships that they  develop\r\n\r\nwith  one  another, prepares them for this cross-cultural\r\n\r\nenvironment  that our young would have to face.   I  know\r\n\r\nthat  these  are more likely to be activity-based  rather\r\n\r\nthan  classroom subjects but, in preparing for the future\r\n\r\nof  education, we cannot help that activities  become  as\r\n\r\nimportant  as  classroom teaching.  So, I wonder  whether\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Education can think about  how  we  can\r\n\r\nprepare our students for the future in the cross-cultural\r\n\r\nenvironment and the world in which they are going to work\r\n\r\nand live in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing we are seeing is that some of the\r\n\r\nsupposedly  successful people are getting  into  trouble,\r\n\r\nand that has got to do with values and ethics.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Loh Meng See, you have to start\r\n\r\nwinding up your speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I just want to stress that\r\n\r\nvalue  education is very important, and I hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry will strengthen this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Ministry's mission statement and the desired outcomes\r\n\r\ndemand that a holistic education system be adopted so  as\r\n\r\nto bring out the best in our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education is about creating opportunities for\r\n\r\nthe  young  to  acquire knowledge, both science  and  the\r\n\r\narts,  and knowledge about life and its skills.  It  must\r\n\r\ntherefore follow that the Ministry must provide  as  best\r\n\r\nas  it can a balanced education and create a vibrant  and\r\n\r\nenquiring  mind  in  the child.  As  he  grows,  he  must\r\n\r\nspecialise,  but only at the tertiary level and  not  too\r\n\r\nearly  in  life.  There must be variety in the  education\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Ministry tell us what are the indicators\r\n\r\nused  to measure the value of a good education?  We  seem\r\n\r\nto  score  well in mathematics and science subjects  with\r\n\r\nour  top  students, but not in English or other subjects.\r\n\r\nHow much of what our children learn in schools serve them\r\n\r\nlater\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin life?  Where are our inventors and risk-takers?  Would\r\n\r\nthe Ministry also allow private primary schools?  If not,\r\n\r\nwhy  not?  This option will bring in creativity,  variety\r\n\r\nand choice for our children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system must adopt a holistic approach\r\n\r\nand   let   the  child  mature  with  a  thinking   mind,\r\n\r\nindependent  enough but not too individualistic,  without\r\n\r\ncare for the community.  The system must be flexible  and\r\n\r\nnot be rigid.  There cannot be creativity, if there is so\r\n\r\nmuch conformity in schools.  The child must be happy with\r\n\r\nwhat  he  is learning, and there should not be  an  over-emphasis on anything that will create unbearable tensions\r\n\r\nin  his learning process.  The nation must not treat  him\r\n\r\nas  an  economic digit.  Education must pave the way  for\r\n\r\nhim  to  dream and be practical at the same time.   There\r\n\r\nmust  not  be  set ways, and there must be an  open  mind\r\n\r\nabout  the  values of education.  What has  the  Ministry\r\n\r\ndone to ensure this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, being a multi-racial and multi-religious\r\n\r\nsociety,  there must be fairness in the education  system\r\n\r\nfor  one  and  all.   There  must  not  be  any  form  of\r\n\r\ndiscrimination,  real  or  perceived,  based   on   race,\r\n\r\nreligion or sex.  The Constitution of Singapore enshrines\r\n\r\nthese matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could argue that SAP schools might favour the\r\n\r\nChinese  students.  Should there not be  similar  schools\r\n\r\nfor Malays and Indians, etc?  If SAP schools are good for\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese, why not for the others?  Why is it good for\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese?   Do  SAP schools create  in  the  students\r\n\r\nstudying  there  to be isolated from  other  races?   SAP\r\n\r\nschools  may  not  foster racial  integration.    Is  the\r\n\r\nMinistry looking into this matter and what is the  follow\r\n\r\nup  on  this?   What are the benefits and advantages,  as\r\n\r\ncompared to the disadvantages of having the SAP schools?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, would the Ministry also look into the whole\r\n\r\nissue  of second language?  There should be less emphasis\r\n\r\non  second  language as a compulsory subject to  progress\r\n\r\nfrom O-levels to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nA-levels   and   to  universities.

I  fully  support  the  intended\r\n\r\noutcome of the new system.  I believe we have always  had\r\n\r\nthis tension between producing responsible, obedient  and\r\n\r\ndisciplined  citizens on one side, and  on  developing  a\r\n\r\nthinking and reflexive workforce on the other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should, therefore, at all levels of the education\r\n\r\nsystem,  differentiate between education practices,  such\r\n\r\nas  uniforms,  discipline, rituals, ECA and  others,  and\r\n\r\neducation content, such as curriculum, project  work  and\r\n\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid mass production at content-related\r\n\r\neducation,  it  is  an  excellent  idea  to  create  some\r\n\r\nunstructuredness within the structure of  the  curriculum\r\n\r\nand  the  syllabus.   The flexible  nature  of  selecting\r\n\r\nsubjects at the Pre-U level, which has been suggested, is\r\n\r\nan excellent way to develop the entrepreneurship drive in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  What are the Minister's thoughts about moving\r\n\r\nall  of  this  unstructuredness to the  secondary  school\r\n\r\nlevel  as  well as to the primary school level,  as  some\r\n\r\nMembers have suggested?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister elaborate on how bright students\r\n\r\nfrom neighbourhood schools will be able to take advantage\r\n\r\nof  the  through-train  system of  skipping  the  O-level\r\n\r\nexaminations?   Will they be easily allowed  to  transfer\r\n\r\ninto schools with the new system?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue is on the setting up of private\r\n\r\nschools  in  Singapore.  Can we be flexible  in  allowing\r\n\r\nSingaporean  children  to go into  international  schools\r\n\r\nalready  in  Singapore?  Given the restrictions  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  placed  in the new system, it is unlikely  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  see  new private schools being set up.   We  should\r\n\r\nhave  the confidence that our children will still be able\r\n\r\nto imbibe local values despite going to such schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on private universities, we already have many\r\n\r\nlocal  institutions that offer distance learning or  open\r\n\r\nlearning  programmes, and we should give them recognition\r\n\r\nto  recognise them as full universities, not just for the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  Singaporeans, but also students from  around\r\n\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the issue of twinning of SAP schools and\r\n\r\nneighbourhood schools - it is an issue that I should have\r\n\r\nbrought up earlier - can I ask the Minister what  is  the\r\n\r\nprogress on this suggestion to address the issues that Mr\r\n\r\nChandra Mohan has just brought up?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, primary education will\r\n\r\nalways be tugging at the heartstrings of our parents,  as\r\n\r\nwe  see  our young adjusting themselves to the discipline\r\n\r\nand rigours expected of them in schools.  For those of us\r\n\r\nwhose  children adjust easily, it is a big  relief.   For\r\n\r\nthose  whose  children do not, it is a  source  of  great\r\n\r\nanxiety and stress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think one way to address this concern is to\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  ways and means to ease the  adaptation  of\r\n\r\nchildren   to  primary  education.   The  attention   the\r\n\r\nchildren  receive  in  class is important  and,  to  have\r\n\r\nbetter attention, one possibility is to reduce the  class\r\n\r\nsize.   I  have reviewed the studies on class sizes  done\r\n\r\noverseas  in  the US and Japan, and must confess  that  I\r\n\r\ncould  not  find  any  conclusive evidence  showing  that\r\n\r\nsmaller   class  size  would  necessarily   mean   better\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that it is more important to have\r\n\r\nbetter   teachers  than  to  have  smaller  class   size,\r\n\r\neverything being equal.  But, of course, we must bear  in\r\n\r\nmind\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat, in Singapore, our class size is already larger than\r\n\r\nthose  of the developed countries which I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I think the one-size-fits-all class size  might\r\n\r\nnot  be  the best option when it comes to Primary  1  and\r\n\r\nPrimary  2 classes.  We should realise that in  our  pre-school, childcare and kindergarten classes, including PCF\r\n\r\nkindergartens, the class sizes are already  smaller  than\r\n\r\nthe standard size of 40.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably, Sir, this is in recognition of the fact\r\n\r\nthat  younger  children need better and  closer  personal\r\n\r\nattention so that, when the children join Primary 1, they\r\n\r\nwill  endure  a quantum decrease in teachers'  attention.\r\n\r\nSome adjust well and some do not.  Thus, for children  in\r\n\r\nP1  and  P2,  I  believe that our children  will  benefit\r\n\r\nsignificantly  from  greater personal  attention  in  the\r\n\r\nclass than they are today if they could have fewer pupils\r\n\r\nin  a  class.   Rather  than calling an  across-the-board\r\n\r\nreduction  in  class size, I would urge the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider reducing the number of pupils in P1 and P2 only,\r\n\r\nso   that  the  teachers  could  better  maintain   class\r\n\r\ndiscipline,  while paying significant  attention  to  the\r\n\r\npupils  and,  at  the same time, meet the ever-increasing\r\n\r\ndemand of higher expectation.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think in some of the developed countries,\r\n\r\nteacher  aides  are used to support the teachers  in  the\r\n\r\nclassrooms. We do not have to go that far but, I  believe\r\n\r\na smaller class size in the early years will work wonders\r\n\r\nfor our children.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Iswaran is not here. Mr Gan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, some\r\n\r\nof  my  parliamentary colleagues have  suggested  that  a\r\n\r\nreview be done on the primary school education system.  I\r\n\r\nagree  and would suggest that this review should be  done\r\n\r\nthis  year  and it should cover a broad scope,  including\r\n\r\nthe following areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the curriculum. It would be timely for us\r\n\r\nto revalidate the primary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool  curriculum,  in  view of the  changing  education\r\n\r\nlandscape  in Singapore.  It may also be good for  us  to\r\n\r\ntake  this  opportunity to re-look  at  the  non-academic\r\n\r\nsubjects   such  as  national  education  and   character\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on single session schools. The main\r\n\r\nconstraint to implementing single session schools is  the\r\n\r\nlack  of  physical  capacity and  the  lack  of  teaching\r\n\r\nresources.   However,  the  benefit  of  single   session\r\n\r\nschools is quite convincing from the arguments from  many\r\n\r\nof   my  parliamentary  colleagues.   I  would  therefore\r\n\r\nsuggest that we could look at implementing single session\r\n\r\nschools  for  the upper primary school levels.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to urge the Ministry to consider introducing  these\r\n\r\nsessions  in primary five or primary six and in  selected\r\n\r\nschools  as  a  pilot  project.  If  this  proves  to  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful and beneficial, we can then extend it to  more\r\n\r\nschools and later, to lower primary classes as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, teacher training. We must ensure both the\r\n\r\nquality and quantity of teachers, especially if we are to\r\n\r\nmove towards single session schools.  In this respect,  I\r\n\r\nam  glad  that  the NIE provides ample opportunities  for\r\n\r\ncontinuous  education and training for  our  teachers  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  and update themselves.  Perhaps, more  could  be\r\n\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, teacher workload. We must also pay some\r\n\r\nattention to the workload of our teachers.  There must be\r\n\r\na   balance   between  both  teaching  and   non-teaching\r\n\r\nworkloads.  If too much non-teaching workload is  imposed\r\n\r\non  the  teachers,  the quality of  their  teaching  will\r\n\r\ninvariably suffer. The losers in the end will be our  own\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review of the primary school system is important\r\n\r\nand  I  hope that the Minister will consider carrying  it\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> In these first 35 minutes of the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  the Education budget, four Members before  me\r\n\r\nhave asked for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsingle  session primary schools.  I would like to add  my\r\n\r\nvoice to theirs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of single session schools have been\r\n\r\nenumerated  in  this House by other Members  in  previous\r\n\r\nBudget  debates  as  well.  And  to  quote  the  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself, they include the greater flexibility in the  use\r\n\r\nof curriculum time and resources for the schools, a wider\r\n\r\nrange  of  enrichment programmes to cater to students  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  abilities  and family backgrounds  in  a  more\r\n\r\nvibrant school culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the educational imperatives and benefits of\r\n\r\na  single  session  system, it will, in  addition,  allow\r\n\r\nschools to push their starting time a little later,  from\r\n\r\nthe  current 7.00 am or so to, say, 8.30 am, so that  our\r\n\r\npoor  children and their mums, who have to get them ready\r\n\r\nfor  school,  do  not have to get up at unearthly  hours,\r\n\r\nwhich  they  do  currently, to be on  time.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nsingle  session  schools will be a boon  to  parents  who\r\n\r\ncurrently  have to juggle getting their children  to  and\r\n\r\nfrom  school  and supervising them after they  get  home.\r\n\r\nThis  is  particularly significant for families who  have\r\n\r\ntwo, three or more children.  We wish there were more  of\r\n\r\nthese  families.  Somehow, it seems there  is  a  special\r\n\r\nvariance  of  the equivalent of Murphy's law for  schools\r\n\r\nwhich determines that if you have two children, they will\r\n\r\ninvariably  always be in different sessions, morning  and\r\n\r\nafternoon,  every year, throughout their  primary  school\r\n\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister responded last to a question on\r\n\r\nthis  subject  in the debate of 2001, he  said  that  MOE\r\n\r\nwould  consider  whether to have single  session  primary\r\n\r\nschools  when PRIME was closer to completion.  PRIME  was\r\n\r\nlaunched  in  1999 and anticipated at that time  to  take\r\n\r\nseven  years  to complete.  I believe that the  programme\r\n\r\nmust have been accelerated, as by the 2001 Budget debate,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  just  two years later, the Minister  reported\r\n\r\nthat  46%  of schools had already undergone redevelopment\r\n\r\nunder PRIME.  It is now another two years since 2001,  so\r\n\r\nI  am  sure  that  PRIME  would almost  certainly  be  at\r\n\r\ncompletion or very close to now.  Therefore,  may  I  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister to please\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreconsider  the implementation of single session  primary\r\n\r\nschools  as  it  will be of significant  benefit  to  all\r\n\r\nparties - the schools, teachers, parents and family life.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to speak on this topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I wish to focus on another group of students,\r\n\r\nthe  weaker students, the Normal (Academic) students  and\r\n\r\nthe Normal (Technical) students in secondary school.  Two\r\n\r\nout  of  five  students today from an  annual  cohort  of\r\n\r\n40,000 students end up in the Normal classes.  And out of\r\n\r\nthis,  each  year, 10,000 Normal (Academic) students  sit\r\n\r\nfor the Normal (Academic) examinations that take place in\r\n\r\nOctober.  From  that cohort, about 80% or 7,500-8,000  of\r\n\r\nthem  go  on  to sit for the Secondary Five  Express  'O'\r\n\r\nlevel examination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from this group, I am told that a much\r\n\r\nsmaller proportion of them do go on to 'A' levels  or  to\r\n\r\npolytechnics, the main reason being that they cannot cope\r\n\r\nwith   the  rigours  of  the  Secondary  Five  'O'  level\r\n\r\nexamination primarily because they have to cope with more\r\n\r\nsubjects in some cases.  Because they do five subjects at\r\n\r\nNormal  (Academic) and now they want to do more subjects.\r\n\r\nThe  other reason is they have to bridge the content  gap\r\n\r\nand be ready for the 'O' level examination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking the Ministry if it is possible to review\r\n\r\nthe curriculum for the Normal (Academic) stream students,\r\n\r\nstarting from Secondary Three to Secondary Five.  If  80%\r\n\r\nof our students go on to sit for the 'O' levels, perhaps,\r\n\r\nthe end point should be the 'O' levels and not the Normal\r\n\r\n(Academic)  examinations at Secondary  Four.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  cramming of content, as well as revising  and  doing\r\n\r\ntest  questions, etc, in a space of nine months is a  bit\r\n\r\nshort  of  a  miracle  when they  are  Normal  (Academic)\r\n\r\nstudents,  because the Secondary Three and Four  students\r\n\r\ndo it in April when they have finished their revision and\r\n\r\nthey are ready for their 'O' level examinations.  I think\r\n\r\nwe are putting an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nundue demand in a way on our Normal (Academic) students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group of students that I would like to\r\n\r\nrefer  to  are  the Normal (Technical) students.   In  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  I feel that some of them, in spite of the  very\r\n\r\ngood LSP programme in the primary school, may have fallen\r\n\r\nthrough  the  gap  and may have ended up  in  the  Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical) stream without really good skills in  reading\r\n\r\nand numeracy.  Is it possible perhaps for us to focus our\r\n\r\nattention at Secondary One just to get them on board with\r\n\r\nnumeracy   and  literacy  skills  so  that  they   become\r\n\r\nindependent learners with the content as time goes on?  I\r\n\r\nhave  looked  at  the  Normal  (Technical)  content   for\r\n\r\nSecondary  One and I still think it is a little  bit  too\r\n\r\nheavy on content.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I also appeal to the Ministry to\r\n\r\npersuade its principals to refrain from discussing school\r\n\r\n'O'  level results both on speech days and annual reports\r\n\r\nas these are results done by our Secondary Four (Express)\r\n\r\nstudents.   These are results brought in by our Secondary\r\n\r\nFive  (Express) students?  After all, the  students  have\r\n\r\nsat for the same examinations, same rigour, and this kind\r\n\r\nof  stigmatisation  runs counter to the  mission  of  the\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nword \"excellence\" is synonymous with Singaporean culture.\r\n\r\nIt  exists in spirit, if not in form, in almost  all  our\r\n\r\ninstitutions' vision and mission statement.  Our  schools\r\n\r\nare  no exception. We strive for excellence in everything\r\n\r\nwe  do,  to  the  point that a newspaper report  recently\r\n\r\nnoted  that some schools have excelled so much  in  their\r\n\r\nexamination  results  that  there  is  little  room   for\r\n\r\nimprovement. We may have to create a grade Excellence* on\r\n\r\ntop of the A* for them to improve further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus not surprising that the other side of the\r\n\r\ncoin  for  excellence is stress. Sir, much has been  said\r\n\r\nabout the stress levels in our schools. We have heard the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  response.  It is manageable as  our  students\r\n\r\nare  indeed  excelling, and only  a  handful  are  having\r\n\r\ndifficulty managing the stress. The other thing is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat it is the parents who are stressing out the children\r\n\r\nwith their unrealistic expectations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coping with stress requires a certain skills set and\r\n\r\nresilience.  The extreme failure to cope with  stress  is\r\n\r\nfor  one  to  go  into  depression and  to  some,  become\r\n\r\nsuicidal.    Sir,   psychiatrists   and   other   helping\r\n\r\nprofessionals have highlighted that stress  is  a  silent\r\n\r\nkiller.  In 2001, about 14,000 children were reported  to\r\n\r\nhave  seen psychiatrists for help.  About 2,000  or  more\r\n\r\nare  new  cases. Studies have also shown  that  5-25%  of\r\n\r\nchildren  have  some mental health issues.   If  we  take\r\n\r\nabout 10% of them, you will have 90,000 students who  may\r\n\r\nneed help, but only 14,000 are receiving help so far. Are\r\n\r\nthey  suffering in silence?  What is the Ministry's plans\r\n\r\nto  ascertain the status of mental health of our children\r\n\r\nto be able to detect them early?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the school system, students are not the only\r\n\r\nones  who  are stressed out. Many have heard how teachers\r\n\r\nare  also stressed out.  One can argue that stress exists\r\n\r\nin  any  profession  and so why should  teachers  be  the\r\n\r\nexception?   I  heard  in a recent conference  on  mental\r\n\r\nhealth  that  noted  that teachers are  the  most  highly\r\n\r\nstressed group among the list of professionals.   Several\r\n\r\narticles  in the New Paper dated 2nd March also  provided\r\n\r\nsome  case  examples of how teachers are  suffering  from\r\n\r\ndepression as a result of work-related stress.  We do not\r\n\r\nknow  the estimated number at this point in time,  but  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is more critical for us to understand  whether\r\n\r\nseeking  help  will  adversely affect  their  performance\r\n\r\nappraisals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this issue of coping with stress is a complex\r\n\r\none  and, therefore, we need to ask ourselves how  do  we\r\n\r\nactually  view  help-seeking behaviour.  Is  help-seeking\r\n\r\nbehaviour seen as a failure to cope or seen as  a  coping\r\n\r\nmechanism?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we pride ourselves as having one of the best\r\n\r\neducation  systems and institutions in  the  world.   Our\r\n\r\nstudents\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexcel  in  international competitions.  We  make  a  mark\r\n\r\ndespite our size.  As we celebrate this glory, let us  be\r\n\r\nmindful of the silent killer that may be cancerous in our\r\n\r\ninstitutions  and systems. Sir, STRESS, is  a  six-letter\r\n\r\nword that can mean Students and Teachers, in Reaching for\r\n\r\nExcellence,  may  be Suffering in Silence.   I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to conduct regular \"stress mammograms and scans\"\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that cases are detected early.  Like  cancer,\r\n\r\nearly  detection leads to the best chances of cure.   Our\r\n\r\nchildren  have  a  whole lifetime  ahead  of  them.   The\r\n\r\nteachers  are  responsible in caring and nurturing  their\r\n\r\nstudents. Let us also begin to care for the caregivers.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, public education on educational reforms. With all\r\n\r\nthe  recent  changes  made to the  education  system  and\r\n\r\ncurriculum for pre-school, secondary, pre-university  and\r\n\r\nuniversity  levels, parents and the public are  generally\r\n\r\nnot  well  informed and clear about them.  Some of  these\r\n\r\nchanges  were  discussed  in  this  House  and  some,  my\r\n\r\nparliamentary  colleagues and  I  had  the  privilege  of\r\n\r\nvisiting and seeing when the Minister kindly arranged for\r\n\r\nthese  visits, for instance, to ITE and NIE.  But,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  we  are the privileged lot.  What is the  Ministry\r\n\r\ndoing  in helping parents and the public understand these\r\n\r\nchanges  in  simple and clear language, and  how  is  the\r\n\r\npublic education to be carried out?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, it is\r\n\r\ncommendable that MOE states on its website, and I  quote,\r\n\r\n\"That  the  education system is flexible  and  caters  to\r\n\r\nevery  child's abilities, interests and aptitudes, so  as\r\n\r\nto  help each to develop to his fullest potential.\"  Just\r\n\r\nas  the industry moves from low value-add mass production\r\n\r\nto   high  value-add  mass  customisation,  so  must  our\r\n\r\neducation   system  evolve  to  a  more   student-centred\r\n\r\napproach to meet individual needs and talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, school principals have been\r\n\r\nentrusted and empowered with the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntask  of developing their school culture.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nmany  still use the same national benchmarks of  academic\r\n\r\nand other rankings as measurements of their success.   As\r\n\r\nsuch,   resources  are  channelled  to  raising  academic\r\n\r\ngrades, altering schedules and focusing narrowly on areas\r\n\r\nwhich the school does well, for example, a very narrowly-focused  CCA.   As Dr Jennifer Lee and others  have  also\r\n\r\nobserved, some schools have too limited a range  of  CCAs\r\n\r\nand  subjects and have designed limited capacity in  non-core  areas.   I  see  two problems in this  development.\r\n\r\nOne,  that schools become too narrowly-focused and  hence\r\n\r\ncannot provide sufficient experience and exposure for the\r\n\r\ngrowing child.  And, two, students who are interested  in\r\n\r\na  particular field of sports or arts not offered by  the\r\n\r\nschool  will  be  deprived of the opportunity  to  pursue\r\n\r\ntheir  passion and this may have the long-term effect  of\r\n\r\nmoulding him or her into a dull Jane or John.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to survive in a rapidly changing world, other\r\n\r\nthan  the 3Rs, we need to help our young cultivate  their\r\n\r\ninterest, which can translate into a passion for life,  a\r\n\r\npassion for success.  No matter how many As a person  can\r\n\r\nscore,  the  battle  is  lost if he  loses  his  survival\r\n\r\ninstinct.  Sir, it is passion, not rules, that can ensure\r\n\r\na  future  workforce that will deliver  their  work  with\r\n\r\nquality  and  pride, equipped to deal with the  world  of\r\n\r\ntomorrow.  I understand that resources are limited and we\r\n\r\ncannot  cater  to every single child.  But,  as  we  move\r\n\r\ntowards mass customisation, I hope the emphasis would  be\r\n\r\non  cultivating  the  child, rather than  on  the  school\r\n\r\nculture alone.  Perhaps the Minister can comment  on  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  stand on this, whether there is a  monitoring\r\n\r\nsystem to ensure that schools are committed to provide at\r\n\r\nleast  a  more  generous basic tier of popular  CCAs  and\r\n\r\nacademic  subjects  to widen the experience  and  mix  of\r\n\r\ntalents within the school.  I concede that while this may\r\n\r\nnot  be  a problem for primary schools, this is a problem\r\n\r\nfor secondary schools upwards, as choice of and entry  to\r\n\r\nschools  are  constrained  by  both  grades  and   travel\r\n\r\ndistance.  Three, the creative industry has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen identified as a growth engine.  What steps would the\r\n\r\nMinistry be taking to identify, encourage and nurture the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of each child's latent talent?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, I would like to focus on\r\n\r\nfinancial   literacy,  or  rather   the   lack   of   it.\r\n\r\nInsufficient  emphasis  on  life-skills  like   financial\r\n\r\nmanagement  can wreak havoc in both the individual's  and\r\n\r\nthe  State's  finances.   It is  clear  from  debates  on\r\n\r\nfinancial  literacy and credit that the majority  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  who  has  gone through a  vigorous  education\r\n\r\nsystem,  is  not  equipped to handle basic  and  personal\r\n\r\nfinancial management.  Sir, we have to ask our population\r\n\r\nto  be  more  self-reliant but part of the responsibility\r\n\r\nlies  with us equipping them with the necessary financial\r\n\r\nskills.   Perhaps  the  Ministry can  consider  including\r\n\r\nbasic life-skills, particularly financial management,  as\r\n\r\npart of the curriculum options.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I remind Members to keep your\r\n\r\nspeeches short, please?  Dr Tan Boon Wan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, during recent\r\n\r\nmeetings  with parents, many continued to voice  concerns\r\n\r\nwith  the  heavy  school bags that their  primary  school\r\n\r\nchildren have to struggle with to school.  They are aware\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry has been reviewing the curricula  and\r\n\r\nthe  syllabi  of  the  various subjects  at  the  various\r\n\r\nlevels.   I  would,  therefore,  appreciate  it  if   the\r\n\r\nMinister could give the House a progress report  of  this\r\n\r\neffort  at all levels and, in particular, at the  primary\r\n\r\nlevel.  Can the Ministry also look at other ways that can\r\n\r\nreduce  the  amount  of  materials  that  primary  school\r\n\r\nchildren have to carry in their heavy school bags?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, at the recent visit\r\n\r\nto  the  National Institute of Education, I saw something\r\n\r\nthat has increased my confidence in our education system.\r\n\r\nA  lady  teacher, with decades of service and one  and  a\r\n\r\nhalf  years  to go before retirement, was learning  about\r\n\r\ncells and DNA, right along with colleagues who would have\r\n\r\nbeen  her  daughter's age.  They were  learning  to  make\r\n\r\nsimple but effective and realistic models of cells\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  doing  hands-on  experience on DNA  isolation,  gene\r\n\r\nidentification  and  gene  amplification.   Others   were\r\n\r\nlearning  about using computer graphics to teach students\r\n\r\nconcepts   about   molecular  chemistry  and   biological\r\n\r\ncompounds.   In short, our education system  is  teaching\r\n\r\nour  students  how  to  make their living  in  tomorrow's\r\n\r\nworld,  by  first  empowering their existing  and  future\r\n\r\nschool teachers.  This is wonderful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I believe we should not put all our bets on\r\n\r\nthe  life sciences.  The life sciences are important, but\r\n\r\nshould  not overshadow the exposure of students to  other\r\n\r\nscientific  disciplines.   The  petroleum  and   plastics\r\n\r\nindustry  is  based  on the once new  and  once  existing\r\n\r\nchemistry   of  carbon  compounds.   The  computer   chip\r\n\r\nindustry is based on the physics of silicon and the semi-conducting  element.   Yesterday's frontiers  of  science\r\n\r\noften will become the bases of today's industry, just  to\r\n\r\nbe put into consumer products built by factory operators.\r\n\r\nAnd  DNA  experiments might one day be as quaint  as  our\r\n\r\nmemories  of  logarithm  tables  and  slide  rules.   The\r\n\r\neducation system, in my view, should not teach scientific\r\n\r\ntechniques  as  ends in themselves, but to  use  them  to\r\n\r\ninspire  students to enter areas of the future,  such  as\r\n\r\nnano-machines, nano-tubes, gena-rays, perfume and flavour\r\n\r\nchemistry, industrial enzymes, drug design and industrial\r\n\r\ndesign.   We should be able to prototype and produce  and\r\n\r\ntest everything from furniture to ships in Singapore.  We\r\n\r\nwill  also  need  the legal, financial, IT  and  services\r\n\r\nsectors, while not being scientists themselves, are  able\r\n\r\nto  understand  people in these fields and service  these\r\n\r\ncompanies.    Exposure,   understanding   and   versatile\r\n\r\nenquiring minds, familiar with the technology of tomorrow\r\n\r\n-  this  is  what our children will need.  I am confident\r\n\r\nthat MOE will continue to rise to the challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Dr Amy Khor is not\r\n\r\nhere.  Mr Ang Mong Seng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in every budget\r\n\r\ndebate,  there  are always some Members speaking  on  the\r\n\r\nimportance   of   the   Chinese  language.    Among   our\r\n\r\npopulation, there are about 30-40% of our people who  use\r\n\r\nonly Chinese as their medium of communication.  When  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants to implement or explain a  new  policy,\r\n\r\nand  if  the Chinese language is not used in the process,\r\n\r\nthese people will not be able to understand this policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to give two examples to\r\n\r\nillustrate the importance of the Chinese language in  our\r\n\r\nsociety:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the NEWater Centre. Recently, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  officiated  at  the  opening  ceremony  of  the\r\n\r\nNEWater Centre.  The purpose of the NEWater Centre is  to\r\n\r\nexplain  to  the  people how NEWater is  generated.  But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, all the explanations in the Centre are  in\r\n\r\nEnglish only. So, those who do not know English will  not\r\n\r\nunderstand how NEWater is generated even though they have\r\n\r\nvisited the Centre.  I encourage my grassroots leaders to\r\n\r\nvisit  the  NEWater Centre.  My grassroots leaders  went,\r\n\r\nbut later told me\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  it  was a waste of time as all the explanations  in\r\n\r\nthe Centre were in English, and they did not understand a\r\n\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Total Defence Exhibition. The Chinese\r\n\r\nnewspapers carried a report about an exhibit at the Civil\r\n\r\nDefence  stall.   The caption of the picture  was:  \"Take\r\n\r\nCover  in the Open\", in English only.  An old couple  who\r\n\r\ncould not read English looked up the meaning of the words\r\n\r\nand  found  that   \"take\"  means \"bring\",  \"cover\"  means\r\n\r\n\"lid\".  So, \"bring the lid inside to open\".  It makes  no\r\n\r\nsense  at all.  Actually, the meaning is that in case  of\r\n\r\nemergency you must take cover in the open and not hide in\r\n\r\na building or some shelter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are implementing or explaining a policy using\r\n\r\nEnglish  only,  some 60% of our people  will  understand.\r\n\r\nBut  if  we use Chinese as well, then maybe about 80%  of\r\n\r\nour  people  will  understand.  If we want  everybody  to\r\n\r\nunderstand,  then  you should use all the  four  official\r\n\r\nlanguages.   In this respect, I hope that the  Government\r\n\r\nwould look into the matter seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Ministries may say that they do not have\r\n\r\npeople  who  are  good  in Chinese,  Malay  or  Tamil  to\r\n\r\ntranslate  the  explanatory notes of the exhibits.  Maybe\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  of  Education  can  engage  some  retired\r\n\r\nChinese,  Malay and Tamil teachers to do the  translation\r\n\r\nwork.  I am sure they can do it well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nprovide some feedback on the teaching of Chinese language\r\n\r\nin  our schools.  Over the years, I have observed  a  few\r\n\r\nthings that happened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, many bright students, especially those from\r\n\r\nEnglish  speaking homes, have shown little or no interest\r\n\r\nin the Chinese language.  Some of them may have done well\r\n\r\nin  examinations and scored an 'A'.  But these  were  the\r\n\r\nresults of learning the subject mechanically.  In  actual\r\n\r\nfact, they are not well versed in the language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also those who do not do well in the\r\n\r\nsubject and find learning the language a chore, if not  a\r\n\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever,  they do much better in other subjects.   Do  we\r\n\r\nknow why?  Is it the home environment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prominent Singaporean businessman recently told me\r\n\r\nhis  experience.  His is a totally English speaking home.\r\n\r\nTwo  of his children struggled miserably in their Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage in primary school.  After primary 6, the  father\r\n\r\ndecided  to give them a different environment.   One  was\r\n\r\nsent  to  the UK and the other to the American School  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   He  told me that after a  year  in  the  new\r\n\r\nenvironment, his children are not only scoring top marks,\r\n\r\nbut   also  showing  great  enthusiasm  in  the   Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage.   Granted, the standards may be lower, but  the\r\n\r\npsyche is now totally reversed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the question is: why can our schools not make the\r\n\r\nlearning  of  Chinese language more  enjoyable?   Let  me\r\n\r\noffer  one important reason.  Unlike English, the Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage has, what we call ci (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) which is formed by\r\n\r\none,  two  or  more Chinese characters.  Each  ci  has  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  meaning  and there may be thousands  of  them,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  combination of one or more  characters.\r\n\r\nEven  among  a set of ci that shares one same  character,\r\n\r\neach will have a different meaning and nuance.  Take, for\r\n\r\nexample, the ci in cheng gong (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), the related ci\r\n\r\nare cheng jiu (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), cheng shu ( ),\r\n\r\ncheng wei (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), cheng zhang ( ), cheng fen\r\n\r\n(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), etc. So, although students may be taught\r\n\r\nthe  ci  - cheng gong, they would not automatically  know\r\n\r\nthe meanings of all the other related ci.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no standard list of ci that students  will  be\r\n\r\ntaught  in  school and be tested on.  Some ci are  taught\r\n\r\nand  some  are  not.   Different teachers  will  teach  a\r\n\r\ndifferent number of ci.  But in the examinations, ci that\r\n\r\nhas  not been taught can appear.  So, to prepare for  the\r\n\r\nexaminations and not to be caught offguard, students will\r\n\r\nattempt  to  learn  all  related ci  by  referring  to  a\r\n\r\nvocabulary handbook.  Believe you me, the amount of  time\r\n\r\nand effort they need to learn the meanings of all related\r\n\r\nci  listed in the handbook on their own or with the  help\r\n\r\nof  parents or tutor is just too much for them.  It is  a\r\n\r\nstruggle.   It  is, in fact, impossible  within  a  short\r\n\r\ntime.  So,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  students are tested on ci that they have  not  come\r\n\r\nacross, they will not have a clue on how to answer.   And\r\n\r\nwhen they do not do well after spending so much time  and\r\n\r\neffort,  they  become discouraged and,  eventually,  lose\r\n\r\ninterest in the language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister would look into what I said\r\n\r\nand  do  something to improve the teaching of the Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, my speech is a bit long.\r\n\r\nPlease bear with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am sorry. You have your time\r\n\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nbilingual  policy is the pillar of our education  policy.\r\n\r\nHowever,  frankly  speaking,  this  bilingual  policy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is a tilted one that gives too much prominence\r\n\r\nto the English language and relegates mother tongue to  a\r\n\r\nsecondary position.  It is bilingualism not in  its  true\r\n\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that I object to the learning of a\r\n\r\nforeign  language or English, as it helps to broaden  our\r\n\r\nhorizon and create new opportunities.  However, there  is\r\n\r\none  question that keeps bothering me.  The question  is:\r\n\r\nwhy  subject the same policy on the mother tongue to  the\r\n\r\nvarious  ethnic groups when the standard of  our  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage is so low that we even have to resort to the use\r\n\r\nof  the  English language to aid in the teaching  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese language today?  I have raised this issue of  the\r\n\r\nlow  standard  of  Chinese language in  the  last  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that, as far as the Chinese language and even\r\n\r\nthe  preservation  and  inheritance  of  our  traditional\r\n\r\nculture  are  concerned,  we are  at  a  crossroad.   The\r\n\r\nprospect  of the Chinese language as well as  our  future\r\n\r\nsocial landscape depends on the path that we are going to\r\n\r\ntake,   particularly  the  holistic   policy   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment is adopting.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my observation, the younger generation, who was\r\n\r\nbrought up under the bilingual system, has no problem  in\r\n\r\nspeaking Mandarin in general.  But because of their  lack\r\n\r\nof  vocabulary, they need to mix with some English  terms\r\n\r\nin  their  conversation in Mandarin.  They may  also  not\r\n\r\nhave  a  problem in listening generally,  but  only  find\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  an awkward position if  the  other  party\r\n\r\nspeaks  too  fast or uses too abstruse vocabularies.   In\r\n\r\nreading,  they  do not have the habit of reading  Chinese\r\n\r\npublications, some even detest doing so. When it comes to\r\n\r\nwriting, most of them have great difficulty in expressing\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the trend that more and more families are\r\n\r\ncommunicating in English, our young people may lose their\r\n\r\nability  in  expressing themselves in Chinese within  the\r\n\r\nnext generation.  What kind of society will we have then?\r\n\r\nI  think there is no necessity for me to portray  such  a\r\n\r\nlandscape to our leaders, who are full of imagination and\r\n\r\ncreativity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now is: does the Government agree that\r\n\r\nthese  issues  that I have raised are  indeed  issues  to\r\n\r\nthem?   Should  we leave the issue to its natural  course\r\n\r\nand  allow this deteriorating trend of lowering  standard\r\n\r\nto  continue,  leading to the extinction of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage and its culture, or should we not make an effort\r\n\r\nin  reversing the trend, even when it is too late  to  do\r\n\r\nso?  Let us wait and see.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my belief that even if we do not emphasise the\r\n\r\nrole  of  mother  tongue in transmitting our  traditional\r\n\r\nculture, its social, political and economic functions can\r\n\r\nnever  be  ignored.   Therefore, we  should  abandon  the\r\n\r\ncurrent principle of linguistic policy, which is based on\r\n\r\neconomic efficiency consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should correct the wrong attitude of\r\n\r\nregarding English as the first language and mother tongue\r\n\r\nas  the  second  language.  First of all, the  Government\r\n\r\nshould stop addressing English as the first language  and\r\n\r\nmother tongue as the second language; instead, the mother\r\n\r\ntongue should be addressed as Chinese, Malay or Tamil  as\r\n\r\nit is.  This should help\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto establish these languages as a mainstream language and\r\n\r\ncorrect the mentality that they are of lower status.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother tongue can never be reduced to a window\r\n\r\ndressing  in  form in our \"bilingual\" educational  model.\r\n\r\nIf  we study Chinese just because we want to ride on  the\r\n\r\nwave  of  the  thriving Chinese economy, and discard  the\r\n\r\ncomplex  relationship between language  and  culture,  it\r\n\r\nwill  only  lead  to a situation where  the  language  is\r\n\r\nemphasised in its utility and resisted in many minds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementation, we have to create a conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment  for  the learning of the  Chinese  language.\r\n\r\nFor the learning of language to be efficient, one has  to\r\n\r\nuse  the  language often.  Regretfully, there is  a  huge\r\n\r\ndeviation  in  our present environment.  By reducing  the\r\n\r\nteaching of mother tongue to just a single subject in the\r\n\r\ncurriculum, it not only puts the learning of Chinese in a\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged position, it also belittles the  status  of\r\n\r\nthe mother tongue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, pre-school education is an important\r\n\r\nlink  in  establishing the correct attitude  towards  our\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  among our children.  We should  start  to\r\n\r\ninculcate in our children the sense of importance of  the\r\n\r\nmother tongue and strengthen the emotional link from very\r\n\r\nyoung. The Ministry of Education should pay attention  to\r\n\r\nthis while reviewing our pre-school education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree that it is not easy to master two\r\n\r\nlanguages.   However, if we recognise that  the  role  of\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  is of fundamental importance  to  us,  we\r\n\r\nshould  stand by this recognition and undertake  decisive\r\n\r\nand   bold   policy  measures  to  create   a   conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment in our school and society for the learning of\r\n\r\nthe  mother tongue.  Only if this is done, can we  expect\r\n\r\nour  future generation to be truly bilingual in using the\r\n\r\nChinese  language  effectively and preserve  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low, your time is up.

There, we got to  see  the  modern\r\n\r\nfacilities and met some of the trainee teachers  as  well\r\n\r\nas  in-service teachers.  I must congratulate NIE for the\r\n\r\nexcellent programme it has put together for the  training\r\n\r\nof  new teachers as well as the continual development  of\r\n\r\nin-service  teachers.  I understand that NIE  is  already\r\n\r\ndeveloping  a  reputation for excellence amongst  teacher\r\n\r\ntraining institutions worldwide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the NIE, I saw some very innovative tools for\r\n\r\nteaching developed by the teachers themselves.   It  will\r\n\r\nbe  good  if  we could consistently identify  these  best\r\n\r\npractices of our teachers as well as the effective  tools\r\n\r\nand  aids  developed by the teachers.  These  are  indeed\r\n\r\nintellectual properties of our teaching profession.  Just\r\n\r\nlike  the way we teach mathematics that has been  adopted\r\n\r\nby  several other countries, we might want to disseminate\r\n\r\nthese  methodologies among teachers to  benefit  all  our\r\n\r\nschool children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to touch on is on the\r\n\r\nrecognition for teachers.  We all know that teachers play\r\n\r\nimportant  roles in education.  They are the  pillars  of\r\n\r\nour  system.  During the term of the last Parliament, MOE\r\n\r\nhad  revised teachers' salaries to bring the  pay  up  to\r\n\r\nmarket, thereby addressing a major issue for the teaching\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also taken steps to recognise teachers'\r\n\r\ncontribution  through  various  award  schemes.    I   am\r\n\r\nparticularly  impressed by the many outstanding  teachers\r\n\r\nthat  I  have the privilege of meeting in my capacity  as\r\n\r\nChairman  of the Selection Committee for the Presidential\r\n\r\nAwards  for Teachers.  However, I feel that the  national\r\n\r\nrecognition  given  to these awardees  could  be  further\r\n\r\nenhanced.   In this respect, perhaps we could learn  from\r\n\r\nthe   Miss  Universe  pageant  where  the  reigning  Miss\r\n\r\nUniverse  has  a  whole year programme planned  for  her,\r\n\r\ncutting ribbons, guest of honour, talking to young ladies\r\n\r\nand  so  on.   I  would suggest that MOE  work  with  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association so that these  PAT  awardees  could\r\n\r\nparticipate in various grassroots\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactivities  year  round, such as the Edusave  scholarship\r\n\r\nand   bursary   presentation  to  better  profile   these\r\n\r\noutstanding  teachers.   This way,  the  respect  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  for  the  sacrifice and contribution  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers  could be a source of inspiration  for  aspiring\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to speak in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  teachers.  Recently, I read with  concern  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper report about teachers reporting sick for stress\r\n\r\nrelated  illnesses.  Over the years, we have  added  many\r\n\r\nresponsibilities for teachers without taking away some of\r\n\r\nthe  old duties and, therefore, teachers have to do  more\r\n\r\nand more given the limited time that they have.  What can\r\n\r\nwe  do  to  make  teaching  more effective  through  more\r\n\r\nmotivated teachers?  If stress is, in fact, affecting the\r\n\r\nteachers,   it   will  affect  the   ability   to   teach\r\n\r\neffectively.   One suggestion I can make is  to  separate\r\n\r\nthe   two  responsibilities  of  teaching  and  that   of\r\n\r\nadministration.  If the teachers can get more support  in\r\n\r\nthe  area of administration, then I believe they will  do\r\n\r\nmuch better and will be more effective in their role as a\r\n\r\nteacher, and not spending too much time in administrative\r\n\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\ntoday, I would like to speak on a topic which we are very\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with, that is, the cultivation of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\npractitioners in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, Prime Minister Goh mentioned at the\r\n\r\nNational  Day  Rally  that we should  have  some  Chinese\r\n\r\nelites  among  us.  I would like to ask the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation whether his Ministry has any strategy, plan  or\r\n\r\ntarget  for  the  cultivation  of  Chinese  teachers  and\r\n\r\nChinese practitioners, and whether or not it has attained\r\n\r\nthe set target.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, in order to cultivate these Chinese\r\n\r\npractitioners,  we  have  already  introduced   the   SAP\r\n\r\nschools.   But  students in the SAP schools are  normally\r\n\r\ngood in the other subjects too.  The number of SAP school\r\n\r\nstudents  eventually end up as Chinese  practitioners  is\r\n\r\nvery small.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYet,  we  do need a pool of people who are very  good  in\r\n\r\nChinese  to  serve  in the fields of education,  culture,\r\n\r\njournalism,  translation  and  business.   The   economic\r\n\r\nreform  and opening up of China and its accession to  WTO\r\n\r\nhave  now  made the economic value of Chinese  very  much\r\n\r\nenhanced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not intentionally forced and encouraged our\r\n\r\nstudents to read Higher Chinese. But, we should allow the\r\n\r\nparents of those students who are good in Chinese but who\r\n\r\nmanaged  only  a minimum pass in English  the  choice  to\r\n\r\ndecide  whether  they would like their children  to  read\r\n\r\nHigher Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, students in the neighbourhood schools who\r\n\r\nqualify  and  wish to read Higher Chinese  will  have  to\r\n\r\ntravel  to  another school which offers  the  subject  to\r\n\r\nattend  classes. This is very inconvenient  and  students\r\n\r\ntend to fade away after some time as it costs more money,\r\n\r\ntime  and  energy,  and  a lot of efforts  to  stick  on.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  the Ministry of Education could look  into  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  allowing more schools, particularly  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood schools, to offer Higher Chinese, if  there\r\n\r\nis demand for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the scholarship plan, I understand the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education has been very successful in sending\r\n\r\nsome  students  to Taiwan and Beijing to  study  Chinese.\r\n\r\nAre  these  students  enough to cater  to  our  need  for\r\n\r\nChinese   teachers?   Some  enterprises  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  such as the Singapore Press Holdings,  are  also\r\n\r\noffering  scholarships to students to  study  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nChina.   Can  some  form of incentive be  given  to  more\r\n\r\nprivate   enterprises  to  offer  more  scholarships   or\r\n\r\nbursaries for students of the Chinese language?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learning of Chinese does not necessarily mean\r\n\r\nthat  you  will end up being a Chinese teacher.   It  can\r\n\r\nalso be extended to cover the arts, music and other forms\r\n\r\nof  visual arts, so that the learning of Chinese  is  not\r\n\r\nconfined to the language alone, but could include Chinese\r\n\r\nculture, history, arts and philosophy, etc.  I understand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the LaSalle School has been very successful in  its\r\n\r\nbranch in China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to balance the ratio between the foreign\r\n\r\nChinese   teachers   and  the  local  Chinese   teachers.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when we are shorthanded, we may have to engage\r\n\r\nteachers  from  outside  Singapore.

I  am\r\n\r\nnot   against  the  idea  of  employing  foreign  Chinese\r\n\r\nteachers,  but  there  should be a  balance  between  the\r\n\r\nforeign teachers and the local teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I  was  told\r\n\r\nthat  that was the only one in Singapore.  Together  with\r\n\r\nthis  state  of  the art infrastucture and  resource  for\r\n\r\ntraining  teachers, teacher salary scale  has  also  been\r\n\r\nincreased   to   attract   new  recruits.    Nonetheless,\r\n\r\nanecdotal evidence still suggests that many teachers  are\r\n\r\nleaving  the profession, citing heavy workload  and  long\r\n\r\nhours as major push factors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in the last one or two years, there has\r\n\r\nbeen an increase in the number of applicants who join the\r\n\r\nteaching profession.  This is likely to be due in part to\r\n\r\nthe  economic downturn.  I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhat  percentage of teachers have left the profession  in\r\n\r\nthe  last few years.  What are the main reasons for their\r\n\r\nresignation?   How  does the workload  of  our  teachers,\r\n\r\nincluding time spent after school on CCA, etc, compare to\r\n\r\ninternational standards?

They are  the\r\n\r\nlife-blood  of  the  system  and  will  make  a  critical\r\n\r\ndifference  to  the  quality of  education  that  schools\r\n\r\nprovide to our children.  Not many of us can remember our\r\n\r\nschool  buildings or our school classrooms.   But  almost\r\n\r\nall  of  us  can remember the teachers whom we  hate  and\r\n\r\nthose  whom we like.  The teachers who have inspired  us,\r\n\r\ngiven  us a nudge, a pat on the back, or simply held  our\r\n\r\nhands  during  our bleakest moments when we were  growing\r\n\r\nup, have made a difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as teachers are our most important resource, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to find out what initiatives are in place  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  our teachers and to take care of their  welfare.\r\n\r\nSpecifically,  Sir, I would like to ask the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation the following questions.  Firstly, I would like\r\n\r\nto  know how we are preparing our teachers for all  these\r\n\r\nchanges  that are sweeping through our education  system,\r\n\r\nbeginning with the revamp of the upper secondary  and  JC\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   Are they given sufficient time  to  acquire\r\n\r\nthe new skills and knowledge to effect the changes?  What\r\n\r\ncontinuing  education  programmes  are  there   for   our\r\n\r\nteachers?  Are there mechanisms where they can seek  help\r\n\r\nif they have difficulties in coping or where they can get\r\n\r\nprofessional counselling?  Are there periodic reviews  to\r\n\r\nensure that they are able to cope with their workload?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point I would like to touch on is\r\n\r\nabout teachers' nodule.  In case, you are wondering  what\r\n\r\nthis means, these are not modules.  They are not teaching\r\n\r\nmodules.   But teachers' nodule actually affects teachers\r\n\r\nand it is a form of illness which affects the vocal chord\r\n\r\nbecause it is over strained or over used.  I notice  that\r\n\r\nthis  problem of teachers' nodule is affecting  more  and\r\n\r\nmore teachers.  I have no statistics, or figures, on this\r\n\r\nexcept  for those teachers that I came across,  and  this\r\n\r\nhas   given  me  the  impression  that  the  problem   is\r\n\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent case which I had come across was a young\r\n\r\nteacher  who is my resident and who, soon after  starting\r\n\r\nher  teaching  career, has suffered  from  the  teachers'\r\n\r\nnodule  problem  and  has  to leave  the  service.   What\r\n\r\npuzzles me is why do we still have this problem in  these\r\n\r\ndays and age where there are so many devices available to\r\n\r\nproject the human voice without teachers having to  shout\r\n\r\nacross  the class.  So the question is whether there  are\r\n\r\nmicrophones  provided for teachers in  the  class.   What\r\n\r\nsteps  have  been  taken  to  educate  teachers  on   the\r\n\r\nimportance  of not straining their voice and  maintaining\r\n\r\ntheir  health?  What assistance is provided to those  who\r\n\r\ndevelop the teacher nodule problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, in a recent\r\n\r\nvisit  to NIE, I noted that, amongst the information  and\r\n\r\nmaterials shared by MOE, was the ASK model, which  stands\r\n\r\nfor   Attitude,  Skills  and  Knowledge.    My   personal\r\n\r\nexperience with this model dates all the way back to 1990\r\n\r\nwhen  I  was  involved in the Service  Bureau  of  Changi\r\n\r\nInternational  Airport  Services  and  the  training   of\r\n\r\nservice  providers.   I can lay claim  that  the  service\r\n\r\nexcellence  in  Changi  Airport  is  attributed  to  this\r\n\r\npowerful model where service providers are trained on the\r\n\r\nneed  to  internalise the three important  components  in\r\n\r\norder  to do an excellent service job.  There is no doubt\r\n\r\nthat such a model has helped Changi Airport to clinch its\r\n\r\nnumber one position as the best airport by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness travellers in the last 13 years, or so.  Such  a\r\n\r\npowerful  model should similarly be embraced by  schools,\r\n\r\nand  students should be taught to internalise the  model.\r\n\r\nThis  model  is powerful because it provides  a  holistic\r\n\r\neducation of the individual.  Yet, we do not seem to know\r\n\r\nmuch  about this model that is currently adopted  by  the\r\n\r\nschool.  Talking to school educationists subsequently,  I\r\n\r\nwas told that the model is just a framework and there  is\r\n\r\nnot  really  a dedicated effort to use it as a foundation\r\n\r\nwhere  the  three  components  of  attitude,  skills  and\r\n\r\nknowledge are given equal emphasis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise two issues with regard to\r\n\r\nthe  holistic education of our students.  MOE has done  a\r\n\r\nvery  good job in imbuing our students with knowledge  of\r\n\r\nsubject  talks.  But two such areas where they  could  do\r\n\r\nbetter   are  in  equipping  students  with  skills   and\r\n\r\ninculcating  values  by  nurturing  their  attitude   and\r\n\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is generally known that knowledge can be\r\n\r\ntaught,  skills can be acquired, but attitude has  to  be\r\n\r\nnurtured.  Whilst we cannot equip learners with attitude,\r\n\r\nwe  can, however, create the awareness in learners of the\r\n\r\nimportance of values which translate into one's  attitude\r\n\r\nand behaviour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MOE has the right formula to model our future\r\n\r\nleadership.   SM's recent address at NTU  has  led  to  a\r\n\r\nbarrage  of  views about the Singapore  youths.   Labels,\r\n\r\nsuch  as apathy towards politics and examination and  CCA\r\n\r\nleave  no  time  for current affairs began springing  up.\r\n\r\nThe  fact  that  SM  was faced with a  relatively  silent\r\n\r\nmajority  had  raised concern about  this  generation  of\r\n\r\nyoungsters, whom we know will, one day, have  to  make  a\r\n\r\nchoice  and  assume  the leadership to govern  Singapore.\r\n\r\nDid they keep silent because they were not interested, or\r\n\r\nwere  they  overwhelmed and awed by  a  great  statesman?\r\n\r\nTheir behaviour could be a result of both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I understand, a programme, such as the\r\n\r\nteaching of values in the attitude component of  the  ASK\r\n\r\nmodel, is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaught  through  infusing this element  in  the  teaching\r\n\r\nsubjects.   My  question is: is it enough and  effective?\r\n\r\nIf it is value that makes us amend, then why is value not\r\n\r\ntaught  as  a  core curriculum subject to  emphasise  its\r\n\r\nimportance, if not for anything else?  We know  that,  in\r\n\r\nnurturing   a  student,  a  tripartite  relationship   of\r\n\r\nparents,  schools and children (PSC) is crucial  as  both\r\n\r\nparents  and schools would act as reinforcing  agents  in\r\n\r\nnurturing  the children.  I am inclined to  propose  that\r\n\r\nthe schools ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time is running out, Mdm Ho.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> --- may want to share the essence\r\n\r\nand  philosophy  of such a model with parents  so  as  to\r\n\r\nemphasise to parents that knowledge alone is not  enough.\r\n\r\nIn   the  home,  attitude  and  skills  have  got  to  be\r\n\r\nemphasised  as well.  In view of the need  to  nurture  a\r\n\r\nholistic individual, would MOE consider incorporating the\r\n\r\nASK  model, and therefore the programmes premised on  the\r\n\r\nASK  model,  such as inculcation of values  and  speaking\r\n\r\nskills, as a compulsory enrichment programme if the model\r\n\r\ncannot  be  subsumed under the curriculum of  the  school\r\n\r\nsyllabus?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, our\r\n\r\neducation system has attained a very high standard.   But\r\n\r\nstill  many are of the view that our education system  is\r\n\r\nstill  too  structured.  It becomes, what  is  called,  a\r\n\r\npaper   chase  learning,  where  what  is  important   is\r\n\r\nachieving high grades.  There is nothing wrong with that.\r\n\r\nBut  I  think  more  than that needs  to  be  done.   And\r\n\r\nstudents are depending on rote learning and model answers\r\n\r\nto questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic environment is rapidly changing\r\n\r\nand  the  employability of our future workers depends  on\r\n\r\nthe  adaptability  of the individual job  seekers.   This\r\n\r\ndemands  agility,  creativity,  innovation  and  an  open\r\n\r\nmindset  to  continuous learning and multi-tasking.   How\r\n\r\nwell  is our education system preparing our students  for\r\n\r\nsuch an environment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, it is also crucial that our training strategy\r\n\r\nfor  the  workers  be  modified to meet  this  increasing\r\n\r\ndemand.   We  could  improvise  the  curriculum  of   our\r\n\r\nvocational institutions that could help to bring out  the\r\n\r\ncreativity  and potential of the workers who attend  such\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would appreciate it if the Minister could\r\n\r\nenlighten on the following.  Is the Ministry relooking at\r\n\r\nthe school curriculum at all levels to encourage students\r\n\r\nto  be  more  creative, rather than conforming  to  model\r\n\r\nanswers?   Are schools given the flexibility to introduce\r\n\r\ncreative  learning at a pace that suits  their  students'\r\n\r\nintellect?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir, first of all, I would like to thank Members who have\r\n\r\nspoken  so  far for their comments and suggestions  which\r\n\r\nspan  remarkably wide areas.  I am also happy  to  see  a\r\n\r\ngood  number of principals and teachers in the  House  to\r\n\r\nhear  directly from the Members the views that have  been\r\n\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past week, there has been extensive\r\n\r\ndebate  in  the  House  on  the  recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review  Committee which Dr  Wang  referred  to.\r\n\r\nEducation has been cited as one of the factors central to\r\n\r\nthe remaking of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry agrees with this. Indeed, in the recent\r\n\r\nfew   years,  we  have  been  making  major  changes   to\r\n\r\nreposition  our education system to do just that  -  help\r\n\r\nour  young meet the challenges of a more competitive  and\r\n\r\nuncertain  future. A future which is not  just  based  on\r\n\r\ncreating  value through high skills and high productivity\r\n\r\nand  reaping the rewards through high wages, but one that\r\n\r\ncreates   value   through  high   creativity   and   high\r\n\r\ninnovation, and reaps the rewards for risk taking through\r\n\r\nprofits and profit sharing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have started from a strong base. Today, our\r\n\r\neducation  system is well recognised for the high  levels\r\n\r\nof  achievement  of  our  students  and  the  quality  of\r\n\r\neducation that they receive.  Our students\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  well by most international comparisons.  We have made\r\n\r\nmuch  progress over the years, but we also  do  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  further  improvements can be made to  provide  even\r\n\r\nmore  opportunities for our students  to  maximise  their\r\n\r\npotential and make the most of their abilities - students\r\n\r\nwith  flexible and inquiring minds, who have the  ability\r\n\r\nto  develop and articulate their ideas, who can thrive on\r\n\r\nuncertainty and risk.\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education's budget for the coming\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  is  smaller than the  FY  2002  approved\r\n\r\nbudget  by  3.7%.  However, the Minister for Finance  has\r\n\r\ncontinued   to  recognise  the  critical  importance   of\r\n\r\ninvestments in education by allocating the second largest\r\n\r\nbudget  to the Ministry of Education, amounting  to  $6.5\r\n\r\nbillion,   or   22%  of  the  total  Government   Budget,\r\n\r\nequivalent to 4% of the GDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Ministry of Education will continue to\r\n\r\nmove  the  education system forward and provide the  best\r\n\r\neducation  possible for our students, by  optimising  the\r\n\r\nuse of these resources placed in our charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the initiatives introduced in the last two\r\n\r\nyears,  which  we will continue to pursue,  are  the  new\r\n\r\nframework for kindergarten education, more flexibility in\r\n\r\nthe Normal Stream in our Secondary schools - some Members\r\n\r\nhave  spoken  about  that already - and  the  changes  to\r\n\r\nJunior  College  and  Upper Secondary  Education  debated\r\n\r\nextensively  and  strongly supported  by  this  House  in\r\n\r\nNovember last year.  In the post-secondary sector, we are\r\n\r\npushing   ahead  with  the  fifth  Polytechnic,  Republic\r\n\r\nPolytechnic, building our first regional ITE campus,  and\r\n\r\nhave  carried  out a review that provides a  roadmap  for\r\n\r\ndeveloping the university sector in the coming years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it is now time to turn our attention to the\r\n\r\nprimary schools.  Dr Wang, Mr Inderjit Singh, Dr Khor, Dr\r\n\r\nJennifer Lee, Mdm Halimah Yacob and Mr Gan Kim\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYong  spoke  on  the  need to improve primary  education.\r\n\r\nDuring  the debate on Junior College and Upper  Secondary\r\n\r\neducation in this House last November, I indicated  that,\r\n\r\nafter  putting in place these changes, we would  look  at\r\n\r\nprimary education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary education in Singapore today provides a\r\n\r\nstrong  foundation  in literacy and numeracy.   The  main\r\n\r\nfocus in the academic curriculum, especially in the lower\r\n\r\nprimary,  is  on English, Mother Tongue and  Mathematics.\r\n\r\nThere is a good reason for this.  These are key enablers.\r\n\r\nEnglish  and  Mathematics are the foundation  for  future\r\n\r\nlearning  in  the humanities and sciences,  while  Mother\r\n\r\nTongue provides us with a link to our roots, culture  and\r\n\r\nvalues.  By international standards, our students do very\r\n\r\nwell  in  English, even though English is  not  the  home\r\n\r\nlanguage  for  the  majority of our  students.   And  for\r\n\r\nMathematics,  our  students are among  the  best  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  While practically every other country in Asia  is\r\n\r\nnow struggling to develop a language education policy  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  challenges  of  globalisation,  our  bilingual\r\n\r\neducation  model of English and Mother Tongue confers  on\r\n\r\nour  students the key advantage of global literacy  while\r\n\r\nanchoring them in their local roots.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped around this core of subjects, our primary\r\n\r\nschools   do   provide  a  holistic   and   well-balanced\r\n\r\nprogramme,   which   includes   sports,   arts,   values,\r\n\r\ncitizenship education and life skills, that develops  our\r\n\r\nstudents  morally,  intellectually, physically,  socially\r\n\r\nand  aesthetically,  to achieve the desired  outcomes  of\r\n\r\nprimary education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our primary education sector offers different\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  suit the abilities and aptitudes  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents.   At  the  lower primary  level,  we  have  the\r\n\r\nLearning Support Programme (LSP) to help those pupils who\r\n\r\nare  weak  in  English to strengthen their foundation  in\r\n\r\nEnglish.  At upper primary, there is the Gifted Education\r\n\r\nProgramme;  students can take also the mother  tongue  at\r\n\r\nhigher level in the EM1 stream; and students who find the\r\n\r\nstandard  subject curriculum too demanding,  can  take  a\r\n\r\nbasic curriculum which is better suited for them in EM3.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang has asked about introducing creativity\r\n\r\nthroughout  our  education system.   A  number  of  other\r\n\r\nMembers,  including Mr Nithiah Nandan, have  also  spoken\r\n\r\nabout  that.   In  the last five years,  we  have  indeed\r\n\r\nintroduced  creativity, as well as information technology\r\n\r\nand  national education, and reduced curriculum  content,\r\n\r\nin  order  to  provide  more time  and  opportunities  to\r\n\r\ndevelop thinking and problem solving skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to review and make improvements to\r\n\r\nour  primary school curriculum, as necessary.  But  I  do\r\n\r\nnot propose to change the structure of the programme,  as\r\n\r\nit is basically sound.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have carefully studied the resources\r\n\r\nthat  we can make available in the medium term, and  have\r\n\r\ndecided  that  we  can put more resources  into  selected\r\n\r\nareas,  which will have a significant impact on improving\r\n\r\nthe delivery of the primary school programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming years, we will strengthen the\r\n\r\nfoundation  we  provide for our students in  the  primary\r\n\r\nschools  through two initiatives: firstly,  putting  more\r\n\r\nteacher  resources into the lower primary, ie, Primary  1\r\n\r\nand  Primary  2;  and, secondly, enabling  Primary  3  to\r\n\r\nPrimary   6   pupils   to  study  in   a   single-session\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most critical resource in the education system\r\n\r\nis our teachers - more specifically, the quantity as well\r\n\r\nas  the quality of our teachers.  Allow me to share  with\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this House the challenge that we  have  been\r\n\r\nfacing.   In  the last few years, primary school  student\r\n\r\nnumbers   were  peaking,  and  the  teaching  force   was\r\n\r\nexperiencing  a  large  outflow, as  many  of  our  older\r\n\r\nteachers began to reach retirement age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I call the attention of Members to Chart 1\r\n\r\n(Cols.  1641-1642),  which  I  requested  the  Clerk   of\r\n\r\nParliament to distribute?  Chart 1 shows that from  1995,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  large  1988 dragon birth-year  cohort  entered\r\n\r\nPrimary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030319/20030319-HA-0761641.pdf\"\">Chart 1: Primary School Intake and Enrolment (1994-2006)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1,  primary  school  enrolments have been  rising.   They\r\n\r\nreached a peak and stabilised in the last few years at  a\r\n\r\nlevel  roughly 20% higher than prior to 1995.  That meant\r\n\r\nthat we needed 20% more teachers as well over this period\r\n\r\nto maintain our teacher/student ratio in the schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we were facing a big challenge,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  were  looking at a much  larger  outflow  of\r\n\r\nexperienced teachers, as they reached retirement age.  If\r\n\r\nMembers  could  look  at Charts 2 (Cols.  1643-4)  and  3\r\n\r\n(Cols.  1645-6), in Chart 2, the dotted blue  line  shows\r\n\r\nthe  profile of our teaching force in the primary schools\r\n\r\nin  1996, with a very large group of teachers aged 45-55.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  they  accounted for something  like  half  our\r\n\r\nteachers.   In  1996, one third, or some  3,600,  of  our\r\n\r\nprimary school teachers were aged 50 and above and due to\r\n\r\nretire within 10 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030319/20030319-HA-0761643.pdf\"\">Chart 2: Age Profile of Trained Education Officers in Primary Schools in 1996 & 2002</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030319/20030319-HA-0761643.pdf\"\">Chart 3: Retirement Numbers and Stock of Trained Education Officers in Primary Schools</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, however, primary school student numbers have\r\n\r\npassed  their  peak, and retirements  of  primary  school\r\n\r\nteachers  have  crested.  We have also introduced  EduPac\r\n\r\n(Education  Service Professional Development  and  Career\r\n\r\nPlan),  which has made teaching a more attractive career,\r\n\r\nby  offering  clearly articulated career paths  and  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive    salaries   which   reward   loyalty    and\r\n\r\nperformance.  We are therefore reasonably confident  that\r\n\r\nwe  will have enough good teachers, which we will  deploy\r\n\r\nto  enable schools to reduce class sizes at Primary 1 and\r\n\r\nPrimary  2, from 40 to 30 students per class.  This  will\r\n\r\nbe  implemented  starting with the Primary  1  cohort  in\r\n\r\n2005.   Smaller Primary 1 and Primary 2 class sizes  will\r\n\r\nrequire considerable resources.  We will require 700 more\r\n\r\nteachers than we would otherwise need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are sound reasons to focus precious teacher\r\n\r\nresources to reduce class sizes at Primary 1 and  Primary\r\n\r\n2.   Given the finite teacher resources available, if  we\r\n\r\nspread  them across all levels from Primary 1 to  Primary\r\n\r\n6, we would be able\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  reduce  class sizes to about 37 per class,  which  is\r\n\r\nunlikely to make a significant difference to the delivery\r\n\r\nof the programme in our primary schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, focusing on Primary 1 and Primary\r\n\r\n2  would allow us to use these resources where they  will\r\n\r\nhave  the  most effect and make a significant difference.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  Primary 1 and Primary 2 classes  are  of  mixed\r\n\r\nability, and teachers therefore have to cater to  a  wide\r\n\r\nrange of pupil needs in each class.  Secondly, Primary  1\r\n\r\nand  Primary  2  are  the foundational  years  of  formal\r\n\r\nschooling, where more individualised attention  can  help\r\n\r\nground  pupils  strongly  in literacy  and  numeracy  for\r\n\r\naccess   to   more   complex  topics  in   later   years.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it will help to ease the transition from pre-school, where class size is usually less than 30.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We deliberated on this measure very carefully, and\r\n\r\narrived  at  a  decision  only  after  long  and  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration.   We have to be sure that we  can  sustain\r\n\r\nthis  increased requirement of 700 more teachers  in  our\r\n\r\nteaching force in the coming years while maintaining  the\r\n\r\nquality of our teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class size is neither as straightforward nor simple\r\n\r\nan  issue  as  it has often been made out to  be.   Every\r\n\r\nyear, during the Committee of Supply debate on Education,\r\n\r\nMembers  invariably call upon MOE to reduce  class  size.\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam See Tong particularly, has been a long-standing\r\n\r\nproponent of this, and I am a little disappointed that he\r\n\r\nis  not in the House to hear my speech.  Shrinking  class\r\n\r\nsizes has an intuitive appeal, and it is an easy argument\r\n\r\nto  make.   I do appreciate the well-motivated intentions\r\n\r\nbehind these suggestions, and I commend Members, who have\r\n\r\nraised  this  matter over a number of  years,  for  their\r\n\r\nperseverance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But making sure that these calls translate into\r\n\r\nbetter educational outcomes is another matter altogether.\r\n\r\nAs Dr Wang Kai Yuen has pointed out, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreality is much more complex.  Empirical evidence on  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of  cutting  class sizes  is  still  mixed  and\r\n\r\ninconclusive.   This  is  not  surprising,  because   the\r\n\r\nfactors which influence the quality of education are  not\r\n\r\nlimited to class size but also include factors like  home\r\n\r\nsupport,  pupil  motivation and,  more  importantly,  the\r\n\r\nquality of school curriculum and programmes, and perhaps,\r\n\r\nmost important of all, the quality of teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smaller classes may in fact be counter-productive,\r\n\r\nif  the  teachers teaching them are poorly qualified  and\r\n\r\nthe  lessons  delivered  are  unsound,  as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nexpanding teacher numbers indiscriminately.  The  key  is\r\n\r\nto  strike that right balance between teacher quality and\r\n\r\nthe increase in teacher quantity that smaller class sizes\r\n\r\nentail, which will provide the best educational outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also not difficult to reduce class size in an\r\n\r\nindividual  school  and  still maintain  teacher  quality\r\n\r\nwithin  that school.  So, if we try a pilot programme,  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  it  will work.  There is no problem with  that,\r\n\r\nbecause we basically cherry pick good teachers from other\r\n\r\nschools.   But  the real issue is, when we  reduce  class\r\n\r\nsizes on a national scale, then it is not obvious we  can\r\n\r\nfind  all  the good teachers we need.   In our case,  for\r\n\r\nPrimary 1 and Primary 2, already we need 700 more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, our target is to recruit our teachers from\r\n\r\nthe  top-third of each cohort, so there is a limit to how\r\n\r\nfar  we  can  reduce class size without  compromising  on\r\n\r\nquality.    Within the top third, only a  proportion  has\r\n\r\nthe  right aptitude and interest and, within that smaller\r\n\r\ngroup,  there  are  only  so many  we  can  realistically\r\n\r\nattract to teach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charts 1 to 3 illustrate vividly why it would not\r\n\r\nhave been wise to make such a move until now.  There  was\r\n\r\nno  assurance that we could maintain teacher numbers, let\r\n\r\nalone   increase   them  on  a  sustained   basis   while\r\n\r\nmaintaining  quality.   Even  now,  we  need  to  proceed\r\n\r\nprudently.   It is not assured that we will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  teacher quality and teacher numbers,  including\r\n\r\nthese 700 teachers that are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequired  to  implement  this initiative,  especially  in\r\n\r\nbetter  economic  times  which  we  all  hope  for,  when\r\n\r\nattracting and retaining good teachers will be more of  a\r\n\r\nchallenge than it is today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our expectations of our ability to recruit\r\n\r\nand  retain teachers in the coming years and the pipeline\r\n\r\nof  teachers  coming  through the National  Institute  of\r\n\r\nEducation, we should have sufficient teachers  to  deploy\r\n\r\nto  schools  to  reduce class sizes in Primary  1  to  30\r\n\r\nstudents,  starting from 2005, and enough to  do  so  for\r\n\r\nboth  Primary 1 and Primary 2, starting from 2006.   From\r\n\r\nnow  till 2005, the Ministry will also need to work  with\r\n\r\nthe  schools to adjust intakes, and make sure that  other\r\n\r\nresources,  such  as  sufficient  classrooms,  are   also\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will also implement\r\n\r\npartial  single  sessions in our primary  schools.   This\r\n\r\nwill be for Primary 3 to Primary 6.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our primary schools are designed to operate\r\n\r\nas  double sessions, with three levels in the morning and\r\n\r\nthree  levels in the afternoon - 3 plus 3.  We intend  to\r\n\r\nimplement  partial single session by having  our  primary\r\n\r\nschools  operate  four  levels in the  morning,  and  two\r\n\r\nlevels in the afternoon - 4 plus 2.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the ability to cut class size is contingent\r\n\r\non  the  availability  of  good teachers,  the  means  to\r\n\r\nintroduce single session is dependent on the availability\r\n\r\nof physical resources, as pointed out by Dr Jennifer Lee.\r\n\r\nOur  ability  to introduce partial single session  arises\r\n\r\nfrom the investments we have made in PRIME (Programme for\r\n\r\nRebuilding and Improving Existing Schools) over the  last\r\n\r\nfew  years.  To date, the Government has spent  about  $1\r\n\r\nbillion  on  PRIME. Since it started in 1999, 72  primary\r\n\r\nschools have been upgraded to latest specifications.   35\r\n\r\nare  currently being upgraded, and the remaining  schools\r\n\r\nwill  be  upgraded in future phases of PRIME.  Over  this\r\n\r\nperiod, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso had another 23 newly-built primary schools.  I refer\r\n\r\nMembers   to  Chart  4  (Cols.  1647-8)  that  has   been\r\n\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030319/20030319-HA-0761647.pdf\"\">Chart 4: Number of Primary Schools by Building Specifications</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt shows the extent of physical improvement taking place.\r\n\r\nToday,  over half of our primary schools have been  built\r\n\r\nor  upgraded  to  the  latest specifications.   You  will\r\n\r\nnotice that in 1998, there are only four bars because the\r\n\r\nbar  for the latest specifications is zero.  In 2003,  it\r\n\r\nis  95.   Under PRIME, schools have been fitted with  new\r\n\r\nfacilities,   including  computer   laboratories,   media\r\n\r\nresource  libraries,  IT  learning  resource  rooms,  and\r\n\r\npastoral care rooms.  We have also increased the stock of\r\n\r\nclassrooms  in  our school system.  Each upgraded  school\r\n\r\nhas  more classrooms, which they can use to conduct extra\r\n\r\nactivities outside curriculum time, and we have done this\r\n\r\nin  anticipation  of  making a move towards  implementing\r\n\r\nsingle session in our primary school system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we continue to redevelop the remaining schools in\r\n\r\nthe  coming years under PRIME, we will have the  physical\r\n\r\nresources  and  facilities to accommodate single  session\r\n\r\nfor P3 to P6 in our primary schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single session opens up possibilities for better\r\n\r\nteaching  and  learning by making  more  space  and  time\r\n\r\navailable.   Because of wider availability of  facilities\r\n\r\nunder  single  session, schools can  organise  a  greater\r\n\r\nrange of CCAs and enrichment activities, especially those\r\n\r\nthat cut across different levels in the school, on school\r\n\r\ndays.    This  provides  the  school  with  much  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  to develop meaningful programmes  that  will\r\n\r\nhelp  enhance  a  child's development in  the  affective,\r\n\r\nsocial, and physical spheres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, single session does not benefit all\r\n\r\nstudents  to the same extent.  The benefits are clear  at\r\n\r\nsecondary  level, where all our schools  are  now  single\r\n\r\nsession.  Secondary students are typically engaged  in  a\r\n\r\nbroad  range  of curricular and co-curricular  activities\r\n\r\nafter  normal school hours.  Upper primary students,  who\r\n\r\nrequire  a  higher level of hand-holding  than  secondary\r\n\r\nschool students, are involved in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter-school  activities as well, but to a lesser  degree\r\n\r\nand are unlikely to be engaged in after-school activities\r\n\r\nevery  day of the week.  Lower primary pupils in  Primary\r\n\r\nOne and Two may not be ready for longer school hours.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  they  tire more easily, and are likely to  require\r\n\r\nmore  home care and supervision or, if not the  home,  in\r\n\r\nbefore-or-after-school   care   centres.   To    optimise\r\n\r\nresources,  it  is best to implement single  session  for\r\n\r\nthose levels that will benefit more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we will introduce single session for P3 to\r\n\r\nP6.    This means, for instance, a school can run its  P3\r\n\r\nto  P6  classes in the morning, with access to facilities\r\n\r\nin  the afternoon for after-school activities on selected\r\n\r\ndays,  while P1 and P2 classes operate in the  afternoon.\r\n\r\nThis  4  plus  2  system makes good use of  the  enhanced\r\n\r\nphysical  facilities that are being provided under  PRIME\r\n\r\nto  improve the learning environment of pupils  according\r\n\r\nto their needs and readiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single session for P3 to P6 will be rolled out\r\n\r\nprogressively.  It will take us 10 years to complete. The\r\n\r\nreason  is  this.  With single session for P3 to  P6  and\r\n\r\nsmaller  class sizes of 30 pupils in P1 and  P2,  schools\r\n\r\nwill  have  a smaller capacity.  I call the attention  of\r\n\r\nMembers  to the addendum that I have asked the  Clerk  to\r\n\r\ndistribute  for  details  of  how  a  school   might   be\r\n\r\norganised.   Schools  that  currently  operate  close  to\r\n\r\ncapacity  will therefore have to adjust their P1  intakes\r\n\r\nand gradually, the P1 intakes will work their way through\r\n\r\nto  P6  over a period of 6-10 years to bring their  total\r\n\r\nenrolment  to  single session levels.   In this  way,  we\r\n\r\nwill  not  displace  current pupils  from  their  present\r\n\r\nprimary schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing 700 more teachers to enable P1 and P2\r\n\r\nclass  sizes to be reduced to 30, and single session  for\r\n\r\nP3  to P6 will strengthen the foundation that our primary\r\n\r\nschool pupils currently receive.  It will give principals\r\n\r\nand   teachers  more  resources,  more  time,  and   more\r\n\r\nflexibility to design the most appropriate strategies and\r\n\r\nprogrammes to provide our primary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool students a more stimulating learning experience in\r\n\r\nour  schools, to bring out their creativity  and  develop\r\n\r\ntheir communication and problem solving skills. This will\r\n\r\nhelp  them blossom and grow, and prepare them better  for\r\n\r\nthe  more  diverse  and challenging secondary  and  post-secondary programmes that are being introduced which will\r\n\r\nin  turn prepare them for a more challenging and exciting\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, this House gave its strong\r\n\r\nendorsement  to the structural changes proposed  for  the\r\n\r\nUpper   Secondary  and  JC  education   by   the   Junior\r\n\r\nCollege/Upper  Secondary Education Review Committee.  The\r\n\r\nnext  step  is implementation. Over the next  few  years,\r\n\r\ngreater  diversity,  in  terms  of  programmes,  mix   of\r\n\r\nschools,  and  curricula, will be introduced.  This  will\r\n\r\nprovide  more  opportunities for  the  very  talented  in\r\n\r\ndifferent fields to pursue their passions and groom  more\r\n\r\noutstanding  Singaporeans in research,  the  professions,\r\n\r\nsports  and  other areas of life.  Integrated  programmes\r\n\r\noffering a seamless upper secondary and JC education will\r\n\r\nprovide  more  room  for our top students  to  engage  in\r\n\r\nbroader learning experiences and excel in their areas  of\r\n\r\ninterest.   Specialised schools will  cater  to  children\r\n\r\nwith  exceptional talents in fields like Mathematics  and\r\n\r\nScience,  Sports  and possibly the Arts,  and  help  them\r\n\r\nrealise  their full potential.  Enlarging the  space  for\r\n\r\ndiversity  will allow our best schools to achieve  levels\r\n\r\nof educational excellence not possible in a one-size-fits-all environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed improvements to JC/upper secondary\r\n\r\neducation  will be complemented by corresponding  changes\r\n\r\nin   the   university  sector.   We  will  provide   more\r\n\r\nopportunities and options to our students at the tertiary\r\n\r\nlevel.   University cohort participation rates will  grow\r\n\r\nfrom  21%  to  25%.   More places  will  have  been  made\r\n\r\navailable  for  polytechnic  graduates.  To  enhance  the\r\n\r\nquality of university education, even as it expands,  NUS\r\n\r\nwill  become a multi-campus university, and NTU  a  full-fledged  comprehensive university.   I  look  forward  to\r\n\r\nhearing Members' views and suggestions on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also pressing ahead with important\r\n\r\ninitiatives  to make our polytechnics and  Institutes  of\r\n\r\nTechnical Education, which are already probably  best-of-class  in the world, even better.  I would also  like  to\r\n\r\nthank  Members  of this House who have shown  their  keen\r\n\r\ninterest in developments in this important sector of  our\r\n\r\neducation  system when 34 Members took up  my  invitation\r\n\r\nand  visited  the  Institute of  Technical  Education  in\r\n\r\nAugust and September last year. I am indeed heartened  by\r\n\r\nthe   positive  feedback  and  encouragement  that  these\r\n\r\nMembers have given to the lecturers and students  of  the\r\n\r\nITE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, the initiatives to improve the\r\n\r\nprimary  sector  and  the changes  to  introduce  greater\r\n\r\ndiversity  and opportunities in the secondary  and  upper\r\n\r\nsecondary sector and those in the post-secondary  sector,\r\n\r\nwill  bring out more from every child.  They will  expand\r\n\r\neducational opportunities for all our students,  do  more\r\n\r\nto  cater to their different aptitudes and abilities, and\r\n\r\nbetter prepare them for tomorrow's challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me now to deal with two issues that\r\n\r\nMembers have brought up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members, Dr Amy Khor, Mr Low Thia Khiang, Mdm\r\n\r\nHalimah  Yacob and Mr Inderjit Singh, have  spoken  about\r\n\r\nstreaming.  I  am glad to hear that most Members  support\r\n\r\nstreaming  and,  in  fact, several  have  advocated  more\r\n\r\nstreaming.  We have been able to achieve high  levels  of\r\n\r\nparticipation  and  achievement  because  our   education\r\n\r\nsystem  provides,  through streaming,  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nadvancement to all students according to their  aptitudes\r\n\r\nand  abilities.  Our streaming system does allow a better\r\n\r\nmatch  between  curriculum and the  pace  and  method  of\r\n\r\nlearning  with  the  aptitudes  and  abilities   of   our\r\n\r\nchildren,   and   provide  pathways   and   opportunities\r\n\r\naccording to different needs and interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have suggested different ways of\r\n\r\nimplementing  streaming or, as some  prefer  to  call  it\r\n\r\n\"clustering\".  Two years ago, we introduced  a  programme\r\n\r\nwhere  students in the Normal (Academic) stream can  take\r\n\r\ntheir  'O'  levels  in  two subjects  at  Secondary  Four\r\n\r\nprovided\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  have the aptitude for it.  Schools do arrange their\r\n\r\nclassrooms stigmatically, several schools do it  and  the\r\n\r\nschools  are  free to try this out if they wish  to.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  after today's session, I am going to St.  Joseph's\r\n\r\nConvent  where they have decided to organise their  rooms\r\n\r\nstigmatically.  Whether  that  will  provide   a   better\r\n\r\neducation  and  better  educational  outcomes  is   still\r\n\r\nunclear,  but  schools are allowed to try  and  they  are\r\n\r\nencouraged to try if they wish to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked for a number of statistics\r\n\r\non the results of streaming.  The indicators he asked for\r\n\r\nare  based  on a narrow definition of success.   It  pre-supposes  that you are a success only if you  go  through\r\n\r\nEM1  or  2,  enter the Express course,  and  make  it  to\r\n\r\nuniversity.  Such a line of thinking, in fact, reinforces\r\n\r\nthe  bad  effects of streaming.  Success should  be  more\r\n\r\nbroadly defined.  Indeed, our education system strives to\r\n\r\nhelp  our  students find success in their own way,  where\r\n\r\ntheir  talents and strengths lie. There are other equally\r\n\r\nvalid routes to success and I am sure that Mr Singh  will\r\n\r\ncelebrate   them  too.   Polytechnic  and  ITE  education\r\n\r\nrepresent  pathways to success in their  own  right,  and\r\n\r\nthis has been affirmed by employment and pay statistics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good indicator of the success of streaming is how\r\n\r\nwell   it  has  served  our  less  academically  inclined\r\n\r\nstudents.   In 1994, we introduced the Normal (Technical)\r\n\r\ncourse in secondary schools for pupils who do better in a\r\n\r\npractical  rather than academic setting.   The  VITB  was\r\n\r\nalso restructured to become a post-secondary institution,\r\n\r\nthe  ITE.  These students now have a chance to shoot  for\r\n\r\npost-secondary education.  In 1994, only 10% of a  cohort\r\n\r\nwent to ITE.  By 2002, this had doubled to 20% of the  P1\r\n\r\ncohort.  They achieve high employment rates and good pay,\r\n\r\neven in difficult economic times. Some have started their\r\n\r\nown  businesses.   Perhaps  they  will  compete  with  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh  one  day.  More  than  1,000  go  on  to\r\n\r\npolytechnic each year. I believe that the 34  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House who visited the ITE last year found it an  eye\r\n\r\nopening  experience, and can attest to what I  have  just\r\n\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members brought up the subject of mother\r\n\r\ntongue,   in  particular,  Chinese  language.   Mr   Low,\r\n\r\nparticularly,  brought  up some  important  issues  about\r\n\r\nEnglish and mother tongue in our society.  Sometimes, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  is told that standards are too low  for  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  and sometimes the Ministry is told that standards\r\n\r\nare  too high for mother tongue.  This reflects the  very\r\n\r\ncomplex  language environment in our society,  and  hence\r\n\r\ncarried  through into our schools.  This struggle,  which\r\n\r\neach  parent faces, if you are a parent who speaks mother\r\n\r\ntongue  you have difficulties for your child in  English.\r\n\r\nIf  you  are  an  English-speaking home, you  often  have\r\n\r\nproblems for your child in mother tongue.  Sometimes,  we\r\n\r\nhave  problems with both.  And those of us who  are  more\r\n\r\nfortunate have problems with neither.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in a sense, this is part of a struggle of\r\n\r\ndefining  ourselves as Singaporeans.  We are  neither  an\r\n\r\nEastern  society,  not Chinese, not  Malay,  not  Indian,\r\n\r\nwhere  we  can just remain in our own cocoon and  develop\r\n\r\nthe  culture,  language to the full,  without  regard  to\r\n\r\nothers.   We  cannot  do  that.  We  are  a  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety.  At the same time, we want to be connected  with\r\n\r\nthe  West,  America, Europe and the rest  of  the  world.\r\n\r\nAnd,  hence,  we  have  English.  To  some  extent,  this\r\n\r\nstruggle  is  a  struggle  to  define  what  we  are   as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  This is a struggle that will  go  on,  and\r\n\r\ncontinue for a long time to come.  But the Government  is\r\n\r\ncommitted  to its bilingual policy, and for  the  reasons\r\n\r\nthat I expressed earlier.  English is the common language\r\n\r\nfor  us  and  for  us to reach out to the  world,  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  is  for  us to be rooted in our  values  and  our\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, with globalisation, regionalisation, the\r\n\r\nimperatives  for learning the language for  business  and\r\n\r\npolitical reasons have also become stronger.  Mr  Low  is\r\n\r\nright, and I certainly welcome that.  Because it makes it\r\n\r\neasier for us to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinue with our bilingual policy and for students to be\r\n\r\nmotivated  to  learn  their mother  tongue.   So  in  our\r\n\r\nschools we try to cater to this diversity of students and\r\n\r\nrequirements.   We  have  mother  tongue,  higher  mother\r\n\r\ntongue,   and  language  elective  programmes  -  Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage,  Malay Language - and we also have  Syllabus  B\r\n\r\nfor  those  who  require a little  more  help.   So  each\r\n\r\nstudent can take mother tongue to as high a level  as  he\r\n\r\ncan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang suggested that we tap on retired Chinese or\r\n\r\nother  mother tongue language teachers to do  translation\r\n\r\nwork.   I think that is an excellent idea.  I agree  that\r\n\r\nretired   Chinese   Language  teachers,   mother   tongue\r\n\r\nteachers, are an excellent resource to tap.  Perhaps,  Mr\r\n\r\nAng  might  want to take his suggestion one step  further\r\n\r\nand  work  with the Singapore Chinese Teachers  Union  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them  provide such a service to organisations  that\r\n\r\nwish to engage their expertise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I will now ask Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam to\r\n\r\nelaborate on the implementation work being undertaken  on\r\n\r\nthe  JC  and  upper  secondary  education  landscape  and\r\n\r\nseveral of the other issues that Members have raised, and\r\n\r\nMr Hawazi will respond on holistic education, CCA, values\r\n\r\nand so forth, a little later in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Madam, let me first provide an\r\n\r\nupdate on the implementation of the changes to our JC and\r\n\r\nupper secondary school system, which Members had approved\r\n\r\nlast  year  after debate, and which several Members  have\r\n\r\nspoken on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the shift to a broader and more flexible JC\r\n\r\ncurriculum.  MOE has set up a steering committee  chaired\r\n\r\nby  the  Director-General  of Education  to  oversee  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of this exercise.  It is a major education\r\n\r\nundertaking, requiring careful design, planning and roll-out.   There is no foreign system that we can  borrow  or\r\n\r\nimport,  no  easy  fix.   This  is  because  the  new  JC\r\n\r\ncurriculum  seeks to provide not just greater flexibility\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchoice  -  more subjects, different levels of subjects  - but  also  wants to retain the trademark rigour and  high\r\n\r\nstandards of the Singapore system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor and Mdm Halimah have asked about\r\n\r\npreparing teachers for the changes.  This is key  to  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful  implementation of  the  educational  reforms.\r\n\r\nSpecific  training will be provided to teachers  who  are\r\n\r\ninvolved in the new curriculum, either in the teaching of\r\n\r\nnew  subjects,  like Knowledge and Inquiry,  or  the  new\r\n\r\nlevels  of  subjects that we are going to introduce.   We\r\n\r\nwill  spare  no efforts on this.  Our teachers  are  not,\r\n\r\nhowever,  starting from scratch.  While MOE will continue\r\n\r\nto train and update existing teachers and new teachers on\r\n\r\nthe  new  curricula, I would like to emphasise  that  our\r\n\r\nteachers are already trained with a core of knowledge and\r\n\r\nskills that enables them to respond to changes in subject\r\n\r\ndesign and to adopt new modes of teaching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members who have joined in the visits that we\r\n\r\nhave  organised  for MPs recently to the NIE  would  have\r\n\r\nseen  for themselves and got a good sense of the  quality\r\n\r\nof  education  and training the NIE now provides.   I  am\r\n\r\nglad that Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Mr Gan Kim Yong and Dr Warren\r\n\r\nLee have referred to this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has asked if we should extend the\r\n\r\nflexibility or unstructuredness of the new JC  curriculum\r\n\r\nto  the secondary level.  This is an important issue that\r\n\r\nwas studied carefully in last year's review by the JC and\r\n\r\nUpper  Secondary  Education Review  Committee.   The  key\r\n\r\nissue  at  the  JC  level was over-specialisation.   This\r\n\r\nproblem does not exist at the secondary level.  The lower\r\n\r\nsecondary  curriculum  is already  broad-based.   At  the\r\n\r\nupper secondary level, all express students must take  at\r\n\r\nleast  one  science, one humanities subject, mathematics,\r\n\r\nand  two  languages.  In practice, among science students\r\n\r\nwho  take 8 `O'-level subjects, 62% of them take at least\r\n\r\ntwo   humanities  subjects  and  two  languages,  besides\r\n\r\nmathematics  and science subjects.  It is  therefore  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  make significant changes to the  secondary\r\n\r\ncurriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think the spirit of Mr Inderjit Singh's\r\n\r\nquestion  is  right.  We are indeed seeking to  introduce\r\n\r\nmore  flexibility  and  choice in  the  secondary  school\r\n\r\nsystem.   That  is why we are creating new and  different\r\n\r\npathways  for our students by introducing the  integrated\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  allowing  the establishment  of  specialised\r\n\r\nindependent  schools  in sports, arts  and  science,  and\r\n\r\nallowing  for  a few privately funded secondary  schools.\r\n\r\nThese schools will be free to structure a curriculum that\r\n\r\nsuits their objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also opened the door to mainstream schools\r\n\r\nthat   wish  to  adopt  an  alternative,  internationally\r\n\r\nrecognised   curriculum.   Further,  we  have  introduced\r\n\r\nflexibility in the Normal (Academic) stream, as  Minister\r\n\r\nTeo  has  just  mentioned.   And  all  schools  have  the\r\n\r\nautonomy to develop niches of excellence in their  chosen\r\n\r\nareas.  So the array of choices in the school system  has\r\n\r\nwidened  considerably.  It is better  that  we  focus  on\r\n\r\nimplementing  these changes well and allow them  to  work\r\n\r\nthrough  the  system  and  be  digested  by  parents  and\r\n\r\nstudents  before considering if we should  introduce  any\r\n\r\nfurther fluidity in the school system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the integrated programmes. At last year's\r\n\r\ndebate on the JC and upper secondary review, Members will\r\n\r\nrecall that MOE has said that we expect to have up to 6-8\r\n\r\nintegrated programmes eventually, catering to the top 10%\r\n\r\nof   each  cohort.   We  do  not  expect  to  get   there\r\n\r\nimmediately.   Schools that are ready  and  confident  of\r\n\r\ndelivering an integrated programme of quality, that  adds\r\n\r\nvalue to the system, will go first.  The four families of\r\n\r\nschools  which  have already received approval  to  offer\r\n\r\nintegrated  programmes, plan to start enrolling  students\r\n\r\nfor these programmes next year, 2004.  They are currently\r\n\r\ndeveloping  their programmes and will be  releasing  more\r\n\r\ninformation  in July or August, in time for  this  year's\r\n\r\nPrimary  6  students and their parents to  make  informed\r\n\r\ndecisions about whether to apply for the programmes.  MOE\r\n\r\nhas  also recently received two additional proposals from\r\n\r\nschools  which  are keen to offer integrated  programmes,\r\n\r\nand is evaluating them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, specialist independent schools. We are making\r\n\r\nprogress on the proposed specialist schools.  The  Sports\r\n\r\nSchool  which is overseen by MCDS will open its doors  in\r\n\r\n2004.   Several  Members have asked about  the  admission\r\n\r\npolicies of the Sports School and I will leave it to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Community Development and Sports to  address\r\n\r\nthe questions, because MCDS is the parent Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS has set up a steering committee, chaired by its\r\n\r\nProvost, to implement the Mathematics and Science  School\r\n\r\nthat will provide a 6-year education from Secondary 1  to\r\n\r\nJC  2.  On the question of a specialist arts school, MITA\r\n\r\nMinister,  David Lim, will be updating Members  later  in\r\n\r\nthe COS debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private schools. MOE is also working out the\r\n\r\ndetailed  criteria  for approving  up  to  2-3  reputable\r\n\r\nprivately  funded  schools that could add  value  to  our\r\n\r\neducation  system.  We expect to invite proposals  around\r\n\r\nthe  middle of this year.  In the meantime, a few parties\r\n\r\nhave expressed interest in setting up such schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan had asked if we should not extend\r\n\r\nthe  concept  of  private schools to the  primary  level.\r\n\r\nThis  is something we studied carefully last year as part\r\n\r\nof  the  JC  and upper secondary review, and  we  decided\r\n\r\nagainst  recommending in favour of primary schools  being\r\n\r\nopened  to the private sector.  Our schools are the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  route  in Singapore for cultivating  a  common\r\n\r\nsense  of  identity  amongst the  young.   We  have  just\r\n\r\nintroduced  compulsory education, implemented  this  year\r\n\r\nfor  the first time, for the very reason of ensuring that\r\n\r\nall  our young go through an essentially common shape  of\r\n\r\nexperience  in  their  primary  school  years,  and  form\r\n\r\nsimilar instincts regardless of social background.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree fully with Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang on the\r\n\r\nimportance of educating the public on the recent  changes\r\n\r\nto  the  educational landscape.  They may  have  appeared\r\n\r\ncomplex  at first glance, but they can be simplified  and\r\n\r\nexplained\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquite clearly to the public.  Information on the proposed\r\n\r\nchanges  has  already been communicated  via  the  media,\r\n\r\nwhich has been doing a good job, I think, on the subject,\r\n\r\nas  well  as  MOE's  Internet website.   The  IP  schools\r\n\r\nthemselves  have  announced  various  features  of  their\r\n\r\nrespective   programmes  and  started  discussions   with\r\n\r\nparents  of  their  students.   MOE  intends  to  produce\r\n\r\ninformation  kits  to reach out to more  parents  on  the\r\n\r\nchanges  to  the education system.  We have also  briefed\r\n\r\nour  schools  on  the  changes so that  they  can  advise\r\n\r\nparents  who  approach them on the choices  available  to\r\n\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have rightly raised the subject of\r\n\r\nteachers, since they are critical to everything we do  in\r\n\r\neducation.   Dr Wang and Dr Amy Khor asked about  sharing\r\n\r\nof best practices amongst teachers.  Professional sharing\r\n\r\nis  a key aspect of teacher development and has gained  a\r\n\r\nfair  bit of sway in recent years.  The Teachers  Network\r\n\r\nwas  set  up precisely for this purpose.  Each  year,  it\r\n\r\norganises workshops for some 4,000 teachers to learn  and\r\n\r\nshare innovative strategies and practices.  We also  have\r\n\r\nan  annual  teachers  conference which  showcases  action\r\n\r\nresearch,   experimentation   and   successful   teaching\r\n\r\npractices.  When we launched the second phase of  our  IT\r\n\r\nMaster Plan last year, more than 7,000 teachers took part\r\n\r\nin  activities over a few days, which showcased the  best\r\n\r\npractices in the use of IT in education.  At the zone and\r\n\r\ncluster  levels,  there  are now numerous  platforms  for\r\n\r\ndiscussion  and  sharing  best practices,  including  the\r\n\r\ncentres of excellence that had been set up.  To give just\r\n\r\none  example at the zonal level, Science Exploria in East\r\n\r\nSpring  Primary  School.   More than  500  teachers  have\r\n\r\nattended  learning sessions at Science Exploria since  it\r\n\r\nstarted 14 months ago.  The Centre intends to publish the\r\n\r\nlessons that have been developed by the teachers so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  be shared more widely with teachers  of  other\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang also suggested that we enhance the profile\r\n\r\nof  our  outstanding  teachers, eg,  those  who  win  the\r\n\r\nPresidential awards each year.  I think this is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood idea.  Our teachers are not show-biz stars, they are\r\n\r\nvery  modest  people,  but  I think  a  greater  profile,\r\n\r\nthrough the course of the year, will enhance awareness of\r\n\r\nthe real value of the teaching profession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah and Dr Maliki have asked how MOE was\r\n\r\nhelping  teachers cope with stress.  It is not a  trivial\r\n\r\nmatter.  MOE conducts many courses to enable teachers  to\r\n\r\nhandle  stress.  Some are specific to stress  management,\r\n\r\nwhile  others are on general well-being that  help  equip\r\n\r\nteachers  with  skills  to handle  stressful  situations.\r\n\r\nThrough   the   Teachers  Network,  MOE   also   provides\r\n\r\ncounselling for teachers who experience stress,  although\r\n\r\nit  has  to  be  said that not all stress encountered  by\r\n\r\nteachers is work-related.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah also asked about teachers' nodules. It\r\n\r\nis an issue, and we have been addressing it.  MOE in fact\r\n\r\nprovides  10  courses on voice care each  year,  each  20\r\n\r\nhours long.  MOE is also collaborating this year with Tan\r\n\r\nTock  Seng  Hospital  to organise a voice  symposium  for\r\n\r\nteachers.  Some teachers do indeed use microphones.  If I\r\n\r\nkeep  going  on  about everything we are  doing  to  help\r\n\r\nteachers  keep their voices, I think I will  talk  myself\r\n\r\nhoarse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon raised the issue of training\r\n\r\nfor  Chinese  language  teachers.  Our  Chinese  language\r\n\r\nteachers   have  a  wide  complement  of   training   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment opportunities open to them.  First, there are\r\n\r\ncurrently 25 in-service training courses each year and 13\r\n\r\nworkshops for Chinese language teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Chinese language teachers can apply for MOE-sponsored Diploma courses and post-graduate studies in\r\n\r\nrelevant courses in local and overseas universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we provide overseas training opportunities\r\n\r\nfor our Chinese language teachers to learn best practices\r\n\r\nwhich  can be adapted to suit our own requirements.   MOE\r\n\r\nalso  brings  in  outstanding teachers from  the  PRC  to\r\n\r\nprovide  demonstration  lessons  and  sessions   to   our\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, MOE has also been sending outstanding\r\n\r\nstudents on undergraduate teaching scholarships aimed  at\r\n\r\nbreeding  future  Chinese language  teachers.   22  local\r\n\r\nscholarships  and  20 foreign scholarships  were  awarded\r\n\r\nover the last five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, MOE is supportive of our Chinese language\r\n\r\nteachers as they pursue other tertiary opportunities that\r\n\r\nare  available to enhance their knowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\nExamples  of  available courses include the undergraduate\r\n\r\nprogramme  with Wuhan University, which was initiated  by\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Chinese Teachers Union  (SCTU),  and  the\r\n\r\nBeijing  Normal  University Bachelor of Arts  in  Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage and Literature programme which is offered at the\r\n\r\nSingapore Institute of Management.  Many Chinese teachers\r\n\r\nare  taking  advantage  of  these  new  opportunities  to\r\n\r\nupgrade themselves.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Nithiah Nandan, Miss Penny Low, Mr Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh,  Dr  Wang and Mr Chandra Mohan asked what  we  are\r\n\r\ndoing   to  promote  creativity  and  an  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nspirit.   MOE completed a review of the school curriculum\r\n\r\nat  all  levels not long ago, in year 2001.  Content  has\r\n\r\nbeen reduced to free up more time for learning activities\r\n\r\nthat  foster  critical and creative thinking.   There  is\r\n\r\ngreater emphasis across the subject curriculum on process\r\n\r\nand thinking skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also aligning our assessment modes with these\r\n\r\nlearning  objectives.   Last year,  MOE  assumed  greater\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  the  Singapore-Cambridge  GCE  'A'   level\r\n\r\nExamination.   We  changed the syllabus  and  examination\r\n\r\nformat for the `A' levels to reward students who are able\r\n\r\nto  apply the principles they have learnt and to think on\r\n\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, MOE will likewise be taking greater control\r\n\r\nover  the  `O'  levels.  This will help ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nsecondary school curriculum meets our educational  goals.\r\n\r\nIt  allows  us to place greater emphasis on thinking  and\r\n\r\nprocess   skills,   while  retaining   Singapore's   high\r\n\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE agrees fully with Dr Wang and the other MPs on\r\n\r\nthe need to develop an entrepreneurial spirit amongst our\r\n\r\nyoung.   There  are  basically two  sets  of  skills  and\r\n\r\ninstincts that matter here, and that are reflected in our\r\n\r\napproach  to  developing this spirit among our  students.\r\n\r\nThe  first  comprises practical business-related  skills.\r\n\r\nOur schools have been actively promoting this through co-curricular  activities  (CCAs), such  as  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nclubs  and business clubs of one form or another.   There\r\n\r\nare  many examples of schools whose students have started\r\n\r\nbusiness  ventures  such  as co-operatives  or  part-time\r\n\r\nbusinesses in schools.  Last week, South West CDC and NTU\r\n\r\norganised a camp for 120 students from the JCs and ITE in\r\n\r\nthe  CDC  and  the Singapore Polytechnic.   The  students\r\n\r\ninteracted with  prominent local entrepreneurs and  CEOs,\r\n\r\nvisited  several SMEs, and developed their own  ideas  on\r\n\r\nhow to enhance the marketing efforts of the companies.  I\r\n\r\nspent  the afternoon with them with Mdm Yu-Foo  and  must\r\n\r\nsay  I was impressed by the freshness of their ideas  and\r\n\r\nthe  gusto  with  which they went about presenting  them.\r\n\r\nThey were serious about what they were doing - so serious\r\n\r\nthat  they worked till 4 o'clock in the morning.  I asked\r\n\r\nthem  how many would seriously contemplate setting  up  a\r\n\r\nbusiness at some point in the future or doing so  with  a\r\n\r\nfew  friends.  About  one-third raised their hands.  That\r\n\r\nis not bad.  I think it is much higher than it would have\r\n\r\nbeen  2-3  years  ago. So the flame is  lit,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nglowing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even our primary school students are being infected,\r\n\r\nin their own fashion.  There are many examples.  Students\r\n\r\nin  Rulang  Primary School have grown a spice garden  and\r\n\r\nhave successfully sold their produce to school staff  and\r\n\r\nparents.  I am assured that they donated all proceeds  to\r\n\r\nthe SPCA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But developing an entrepreneurial spirit goes beyond\r\n\r\nteaching  students  the  skills and  technical  knowledge\r\n\r\ninvolved  in starting or running a business.  The  second\r\n\r\nand a key part of MOE's approach is to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfocus  on  key  traits  that  underlie  entrepreneurship:\r\n\r\nresourcefulness,  persistence in the face  of  difficulty\r\n\r\nand  the habit of innovation.  These are traits that  are\r\n\r\nuseful  for  all our students, not just those  who  might\r\n\r\neventually go on to run a business.  We want our students\r\n\r\nto  be  willing  to work out new perspectives,  have  the\r\n\r\nboldness and self-conviction to try another way,  take  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  road  and,  occasionally,  break  the   mould.\r\n\r\nEfforts  to  develop  these traits will  be  manifest  in\r\n\r\nvarious facets of our school programmes, starting even in\r\n\r\nour primary schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has already made major changes in this\r\n\r\ndirection,  but  agrees that more can be  done.   We  are\r\n\r\ncurrently undertaking a comprehensive study to see how we\r\n\r\ncan   better   nurture  the  spirit  of  enterprise   and\r\n\r\ninnovation in our students. We should not aim  for  quick\r\n\r\nresults  and  we will not, as Dr Wang says, produce  bus-loads  of  entrepreneurs.  But we can  and  will  produce\r\n\r\ngenerations  of  Singaporeans who are able  to  face  the\r\n\r\nfuture  with confidence, try more diverse paths,  persist\r\n\r\nagainst the odds and thrive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh has suggested introducing entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nas  a  CCA.   Cooperative societies, which are recognised\r\n\r\nCCAs,  have  been  formed  in  some  schools  to  develop\r\n\r\nbusiness  acumen in pupils.  Other schools  have  started\r\n\r\nYoung  Enterprise  Clubs  as core  CCAs  to  develop  and\r\n\r\nnurture future entrepreneurs.  The NYAA is free to assist\r\n\r\nschools in setting up entrepreneur clubs, which are  also\r\n\r\nrecognised CCAs.  MOE will continue, of course,  to  give\r\n\r\nschools the autonomy to decide on the setting up of  such\r\n\r\nclubs as part of their overall school programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan raised the perennial problem of\r\n\r\nheavy  school bags.  I would like to assure him that  MOE\r\n\r\nand  the schools have been working at this.  We have made\r\n\r\ntextbooks  thinner  by  dividing them  up  into  separate\r\n\r\nvolumes  for  each  module.   Schools  have  lockers  for\r\n\r\nchildren to keep their belongings.  Teachers look out for\r\n\r\nyoung  pupils who seem to have heavy bags, and  sometimes\r\n\r\neven check their bags.  Schools will continue to work  at\r\n\r\nthis problem but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparents  must  also supervise their children  in  packing\r\n\r\ntheir bags.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low commented that we should nurture\r\n\r\nstudents'  passions  for particular  subject  areas.   We\r\n\r\nquite agree.  There is a whole host of programmes, in our\r\n\r\nschools  and within school clusters, to cater to students\r\n\r\nwith  special talents and interests, in the  arts,  music\r\n\r\nand  the  sciences.  At the JC level, the new  curriculum\r\n\r\nwill  provide more space for this. In other words, within\r\n\r\nthe  formal curriculum, we want to provide more space for\r\n\r\nthis.  Students with a special interest and ability in  a\r\n\r\nsubject  will be able to take it further as an H3 subject\r\n\r\n-  if Members recall the terminology.  They can do it  by\r\n\r\neither taking research under the mentorship of university\r\n\r\nprofessors or researchers or in some other forms which we\r\n\r\nare  working out.  There are several examples of students\r\n\r\nwho   are   already  doing  this,  outside   the   formal\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   For example, Tan Chun Ghee,  who  graduated\r\n\r\nfrom RJC last year.  While in JC1, he spent six weeks  at\r\n\r\nthe  Centre for Excellence in Education at MIT in the US,\r\n\r\nunder an attachment programme arranged by the MOE.   Chun\r\n\r\nGhee's project, while he was at MIT, won him three awards\r\n\r\nat  the  Intel Science and Engineering Fair in  Kentucky,\r\n\r\nUS, that year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee raised the matter of the teaching of\r\n\r\nlife  sciences.  We agree with his observations.  MOE  is\r\n\r\ntaking  the life sciences seriously, not because  we  are\r\n\r\nbedazzled  by recent discoveries, but because this  is  a\r\n\r\nrevolution  in  knowledge, one that will  transform  many\r\n\r\ndisciplines, and will change how we live.  It  is  a  new\r\n\r\nlanguage  of  science that all students will find  useful\r\n\r\neven if they do not plan to pursue the life sciences as a\r\n\r\ncareer.   Topics and approaches that enhance the learning\r\n\r\nof  the  life  sciences have therefore been  incorporated\r\n\r\ninto    the   primary,   secondary   and   pre-university\r\n\r\nsyllabuses, not only in the science subjects, but also in\r\n\r\nother subjects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not putting all our eggs in the life sciences\r\n\r\nbasket.   We  agree  with  Dr Lee  that  other  areas  of\r\n\r\nknowledge remain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquite essential.  While the number of students opting for\r\n\r\n\"A\" level Biology has increased to 20% last year compared\r\n\r\nto  13%  in  the  year  2000, it is not  disproportionate\r\n\r\ncompared  to, say, the candidature for Physics, which  is\r\n\r\n66%.   And with the review of the JC curriculum,  science\r\n\r\nstudents  will  also be required to  take  at  least  one\r\n\r\nhumanities  subject.  So we are broadening our  students,\r\n\r\nbroadening the curriculum, as we inject the life sciences\r\n\r\ninto the curriculum, not narrowing them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema had asked about what MOE was doing to help\r\n\r\nour  Secondary 4N (Academic) students make the transition\r\n\r\nto  Secondary  5  where they take the  'O'  levels.   The\r\n\r\nNormal (Academic) syllabuses are generally subsets of the\r\n\r\n`O' level syllabuses.  They are designed such that Normal\r\n\r\n(Academic) students who are capable of going on to  offer\r\n\r\nthe  `O' levels are able to progress smoothly to the  `O'\r\n\r\nlevels in three years from Secondary 3.  A review of  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum was conducted in 1999 which helped  to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  assessment gap between the 'N' levels  and  the  'O'\r\n\r\nlevels  in  various subjects.   For example, the  History\r\n\r\npaper  now  focuses more on questions requiring  thinking\r\n\r\nskills and the application of concepts instead of content\r\n\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitably, even among the Normal (Academic)\r\n\r\nstudents,  there will be differences in the abilities  of\r\n\r\nthe  students  in  our schools.  The  teachers  recognise\r\n\r\nthis, and adjust their teaching methods and pace to  suit\r\n\r\nthe  needs of different groups of students.  Teachers may\r\n\r\ndecide  how  much to teach based on the  ability  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents.  This difference in the scope of coverage means\r\n\r\nthat  the  weaker students will be prepared  sufficiently\r\n\r\nwell to pass the 'O' levels, while the more able students\r\n\r\nwill probably perform better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Secondary 5 students are, by and large, coping\r\n\r\nquite  well  with  the  `O' levels.   About  66%  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents  progress  on to our post-secondary  educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  Of that 66%, 45% do well enough to qualify\r\n\r\nfor either the polytechnics or 'A' levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki also asked about stress and the incidence\r\n\r\nof  psychiatric  illness or psychological problems  among\r\n\r\nour  students.   According to statistics from  the  Child\r\n\r\nGuidance  Clinic, the total number of new cases  seen  in\r\n\r\n2002  was  about  2,000.  Of these,  about  4%  concerned\r\n\r\nmental  health  problems or psychiatric illnesses.    The\r\n\r\nincidence of cases referred to the Child Guidance  Clinic\r\n\r\nhas  increased, but it remains low, certainly lower  than\r\n\r\nthat of most of the advanced societies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All societies have children who face stress-related\r\n\r\nproblems of one form or another.  What matters is that we\r\n\r\nhave  the  mechanisms  in place  to  help  the  children.\r\n\r\nMembers  have previously been informed of the counselling\r\n\r\nand referral system that we have in place in all schools,\r\n\r\nsupported   by   trained  Teacher   Counsellors,   School\r\n\r\nCounsellors,   and   specialist   support   from    MOE's\r\n\r\neducational psychologists and guidance specialists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out too that an increase in referrals\r\n\r\nneed  not  always be seen as a negative development.   It\r\n\r\nalso  means  that more students are being counselled  and\r\n\r\nhelped where they might not have been helped before.   It\r\n\r\nwould   also  reflect  greater  awareness  of   potential\r\n\r\nproblems amongst parents and teachers, and more resources\r\n\r\nbecoming available for counselling in schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Singh.

I  have  several\r\n\r\nconcerns   about  its  recommendations.    Firstly,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is targeting to enrol 25% of the cohort  into\r\n\r\nuniversity  when  the implementation is  in  full  swing.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  numerical target. Once  the  facilities  and\r\n\r\nmanpower  have been built up to take in this number,  the\r\n\r\ninstitutions  will enrol that target number of  students.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in terms of calibre, we might not be  enrolling\r\n\r\nthe top 25%.  We know that significant numbers of our  JC\r\n\r\nstudents go overseas for their education. Thus, we  could\r\n\r\nbe  enrolling students down to the top 30% of  a  cohort.\r\n\r\nIf  that  is  the  case, would there be  a  concern  that\r\n\r\nstandards  in our universities could be maintained?   And\r\n\r\nhow does this tie in with our aspiration to build a world-class university in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the current graduate unemployment rate\r\n\r\nhas  illustrated that our economy might  not  absorb  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of graduates already as it is.  If we expand  the\r\n\r\nenrolment  further, would we be creating an  even  bigger\r\n\r\nproblem in the future?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2000, former Minister of State, Mr Peter\r\n\r\nChen, championed the concept of a fourth university.  One\r\n\r\nof  the objectives of the fourth university was to  cater\r\n\r\nto  the  aspiration  of  the large  pool  of  polytechnic\r\n\r\ngraduates in the workforce looking for an opportunity  to\r\n\r\nupgrade.   As  we know, 60% of the 'O' level students  in\r\n\r\nour  cohort proceed to polytechnic.  And, at the  moment,\r\n\r\nonly  the  top 10% of polytechnic graduates get to  enrol\r\n\r\ninto  the  local  universities.  Yet, of those  who  have\r\n\r\ngained  admission  into foreign universities,  they  have\r\n\r\nperformed very well.  Now that the fourth university\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  no longer on the table, do we cater to this niche  in\r\n\r\nthe  new vision of university education landscape in  the\r\n\r\nfuture?\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, would the Minister explain the trade-off between the cluster university concept versus\r\n\r\nstarting  the  fourth university as originally  proposed?\r\n\r\nThe  market had actually responded to the vacuum with SIM\r\n\r\npublicly declaring its interest to evolve into the fourth\r\n\r\nuniversity.   Does  this proclamation  by  SIM  have  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's support?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Madam, let me say, at the\r\n\r\noutset,  that  I  support  the University  Sector  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee's  recommendation to  increase  the  number  of\r\n\r\nplaces  at  our local universities and to allow  a  small\r\n\r\nnumber of private universities to be set up in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthus providing more diversity and choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I wish to raise two issues relating to the\r\n\r\nUniversity Sector Review Committee's Report.  The  target\r\n\r\ncohort  participation rate by 2010 is 25%,  up  from  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  21%.  Each year, thousands of private candidates\r\n\r\ntake  the  'A'  courses from a wide range  of  programmes\r\n\r\noffered  by  many  different schools,  some  of  doubtful\r\n\r\nquality.  Some of our polytechnic graduates seek a second\r\n\r\nchance  to  pursue a degree.  Others completed their  'A'\r\n\r\nlevels  but could not gain admission into either  NUS  or\r\n\r\nNTU.   Those who can afford to go overseas do.  There  is\r\n\r\nclearly  a  demand for university education from  a  wide\r\n\r\npool of potential candidates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, the CPR of some western countries is\r\n\r\nas  much as 40% to 50%.  I am not advocating that target.\r\n\r\nBut  I understand and accept the Ministry's concern about\r\n\r\nnot  diluting  standards  from  too  high  a  number   of\r\n\r\nstudents.    However,  I  differ  from  my  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleague, Dr Wang Kai Yuen's view.  I feel that there is\r\n\r\ncertainly room to raise the CPR to 30%, or so, in  future\r\n\r\nwithout  diluting  standards because of the  increasingly\r\n\r\nhigh quality of students.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue concerns the question of staffing at\r\n\r\nthe universities.  I understand that quality teaching and\r\n\r\nresearch  staff  in some disciplines are sorely  lacking,\r\n\r\nand  recruitment is often done overseas.  Foreign talents\r\n\r\noften  fill  many  of  the posts.  While  some  of  these\r\n\r\nforeign  talents  eventually make  their  home  here  and\r\n\r\nthereby  contribute to Singapore's manpower  development,\r\n\r\nmany  more  choose to leave at the end of their contract.\r\n\r\nAre  there mechanisms in place to ensure that the  skills\r\n\r\nand expertise of these talents are somehow transferred to\r\n\r\nthe  local staff?  What is the ratio of local to  foreign\r\n\r\nstaff  at  NUS  and NTU currently?  What is the  turnover\r\n\r\nrate  for local and foreign university lecturers in  each\r\n\r\nof these two universities in the last two years?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, as\r\n\r\nSingapore  faces  the  21st century  with  its  many  new\r\n\r\nchallenges  and rapid global developments, we envision  a\r\n\r\nnation of responsible citizens and creative thinkers  who\r\n\r\nare  determined  to learn throughout  their  lives.   The\r\n\r\nemphasis  is  on  continuous upgrading and  the  thinking\r\n\r\nshould  be  \"Am  I a knowledge worker?   And  if  I  have\r\n\r\nsucceeded  in  becoming a knowledge worker today,  I  may\r\n\r\nneed  to  acquire new skills tomorrow so that  I  am  not\r\n\r\nobsolete in my dynamic environment.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Madam, the university sector review is\r\n\r\ntimely.   And  I fully support the major initiatives  and\r\n\r\nplans.  Our institutes of higher learning are intricately\r\n\r\nlinked  to  our  chief engines of growth.   However,  are\r\n\r\nconcrete steps being made to open up university places to\r\n\r\nthe  thousands of diploma holders and working adults  who\r\n\r\ndream  of a tertiary education and experience?  Are there\r\n\r\nstill university courses that are not open to the diploma\r\n\r\ngraduates?  If so, why is this so?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, with the plan to turn NTU to a full-fledged\r\n\r\nuniversity  offering a comprehensive  range  of  courses,\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the Ministry's plans or check and  balance  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  NTU  continues to gain  more  momentum  and\r\n\r\nbecome more reputable,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstead  of falling back to its past reputation?   May  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that it may be worthwhile for NTU to consider  a\r\n\r\nnew  name  to  reflect its renewed identity, mission  and\r\n\r\nvision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Madam, may I also propose that our\r\n\r\nuniversities   exercise  flexibility  in   allowing   the\r\n\r\nstudents  to take breaks and sabbatical leave to  explore\r\n\r\nand  try  new  experiences, maybe start up a business  or\r\n\r\ntravel the world in between their course period.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Madam, the current content\r\n\r\nand  pedagogy of university education at NUS show a  bias\r\n\r\ntowards research and development largely by design  given\r\n\r\nthe  emphasis  of  the  current administration  on  staff\r\n\r\npublications.  This might be appropriate for the Science,\r\n\r\nArts and Technology disciplines, but perhaps less so  for\r\n\r\nother  more  professional disciplines.  Consequently,  it\r\n\r\nappears  that  applied research and  practice  orientated\r\n\r\ncurriculum currently do not feature highly in the overall\r\n\r\ninstitutional ethos.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers often tell me that, compared to graduates\r\n\r\nfrom  the  polytechnics, NUS and NTU graduates,  although\r\n\r\nmore  mature  when  they leave the universities,  have  a\r\n\r\npoorer   grasp   of  the  practical  aspects   of   their\r\n\r\ndisciplines.    It  is  of  course  possible   to   argue\r\n\r\nphilosophically  that  the  purpose  of   an   university\r\n\r\neducation  is not to make artisans or technicians.   That\r\n\r\nis  the polytechnic's job.  But I suspect that, if a poll\r\n\r\nof  employers were taken, many would say that  they  wish\r\n\r\nthe university graduates put combined thinking skills and\r\n\r\na  better mastery of the technical skills required of the\r\n\r\njob.  Some graduates have little bent for R&D, preferring\r\n\r\ninstead to, so to speak, soil their hands in our quest to\r\n\r\nmove  up the value chain.  Have we neglected these  other\r\n\r\naspirations  for  industry  oriented  degree  programmes,\r\n\r\nespecially for the professional disciplines?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the recent debate about the respective\r\n\r\nmarriage  of  the three universities and whether  or  not\r\n\r\nMarina is really different, as the advertisement says,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarks  a  growing awareness that university education  is\r\n\r\nmore  than just the impartation of knowledge and  skills.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this debate will spur all the three universities\r\n\r\nto  closely examine their pedagogical methods  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  graduates  of whichever university they  come  from\r\n\r\nhave the requisite technical, professional as well as the\r\n\r\nlife skills needed to thrive in the New Economy.  I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister how the universities will ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there is a balance between the quest to be a world-class  research  university and producing graduates  that\r\n\r\nmeet the needs of the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Madam, currently, only\r\n\r\nabout  17%  of  our  workforce are graduates.   With  the\r\n\r\nintention to increase the cohort to 25%, we are  now  one\r\n\r\nstep  closer  to  a system of mass education  where  more\r\n\r\nstudents, regardless of background, have a chance to do a\r\n\r\ntertiary   course.   But  this  ignores  the  fact   that\r\n\r\nincreased  participation does not always lead  to  higher\r\n\r\nstandards.   In fact, according to a report in  Australia\r\n\r\non  the  changes  in academic work, the opposite  is  the\r\n\r\ncase.  We also need to be conscious of the fact that  the\r\n\r\ndrop-out rate does not increase after the student  intake\r\n\r\nis enlarged in our universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, no one denies the importance of a tertiary\r\n\r\neducation.  Graduates not only have a greater  chance  of\r\n\r\ngaining  employment and earning more, but also  have  the\r\n\r\nprivilege  of  fulfilling their intellectual  curiosities\r\n\r\nand academic ambitions.  However, there is multi evidence\r\n\r\nin  many  countries  that, as the  tertiary  institutions\r\n\r\nenlarge  their intake of students, many of these colleges\r\n\r\njust  fail  the  standard tests.  Instead  of  developing\r\n\r\nacademic excellence and high quality education,  many  of\r\n\r\nthese  tertiary  courses  promote  a  mediocre  level  of\r\n\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, if our rhetoric about a knowledge nation and\r\n\r\nour  intent  to  be  an education  hub  is  to  be  taken\r\n\r\nseriously,  how  would  the  Ministry  ensure  that   our\r\n\r\nuniversities  are  indeed  the  world's  best  and  their\r\n\r\nstandards would not be compromised by a bigger cohort?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note with concern that this year's budget\r\n\r\nallocation to the Ministry of Education has decreased  by\r\n\r\nabout  10%.

And can the Minister also assure this House\r\n\r\nthat the tuition fees will not be increased to cover  the\r\n\r\nbudget cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Madam, I have two points to raise on\r\n\r\nthe  matter of university education.  The first  pertains\r\n\r\nto  the recently announced decision to go in favour of  a\r\n\r\nmulti-campus  model  through the National  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   as   opposed   to   the   introduction   and\r\n\r\nestablishment  of a fourth university.  I appreciate  the\r\n\r\nmodel of a multi-campus university and I think there  are\r\n\r\nsome  excellent examples around the world.  For  example,\r\n\r\nthe  University of California where this has  been  quite\r\n\r\nsuccessful in offering a high standard of education to  a\r\n\r\nbroad spectrum of students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, it is a little lamentable that we\r\n\r\nappear  to  have lost an opportunity to establish  a  new\r\n\r\ninstitution  of  higher learning with its own  character,\r\n\r\nculture,  mission,  perhaps, even pedagogic  methods  and\r\n\r\nsubjects  focus.  And the question is whether within  the\r\n\r\nmodel  of a multi-campus institution, such diversity  can\r\n\r\nbe  achieved.  This is particularly the case because when\r\n\r\nwe  discussed the fourth university idea some time  back,\r\n\r\none  of  the  motivations  was to  try  and  broaden  the\r\n\r\noffering  at  the tertiary level to all students.   So  I\r\n\r\nwould  appreciate a clarification as to why the  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas   chosen  this  path  and  how  NUS  and  the   other\r\n\r\ninstitutions  we  have at the higher  learning  level  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  offer the variety that  we  are  talking\r\n\r\nabout and we see diversity at the tertiary level for  our\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is a matter of most specific\r\n\r\noperational detail.  Recently, the National University of\r\n\r\nSingapore  has announced various trends to  redefine  the\r\n\r\nterms  of employment for the lecturers at the university.\r\n\r\nAnd  there has been a range of consultation sessions that\r\n\r\nhave occurred.  I have received feedback from numerous\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsources on this matter.  And my sense of it is that there\r\n\r\nis  an  element of uncertainty and disquiet  amongst  the\r\n\r\nfaculty  staff.   I think the key issues that  they  have\r\n\r\nexpressed are that, first, they are not really  clear  of\r\n\r\nthe  rationale behind this move.  Is there a cost cutting\r\n\r\nexercise,  or are there other more fundamental objectives\r\n\r\nin  play?   And,  secondly, whether this  is  actually  a\r\n\r\ndecision that has been taken and has been communicated to\r\n\r\nthem  at this point, or is this a feedback exercise which\r\n\r\nwould  then be factored into the final decision.  I would\r\n\r\nappreciate it if a clarification from the Minister as  to\r\n\r\nthe intent and the rationale behind this exercise, and to\r\n\r\nalso  let  us  know when a decision, if it has  not  been\r\n\r\ntaken  already, will be taken and implemented.   I  think\r\n\r\nthis  would  go  a  long way in at least  dispelling  the\r\n\r\nuncertainty in the minds of many of the university staff.\r\n\r\nI  think that, in turn, it will have a positive effect on\r\n\r\nthe learning environment in the university.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Madam, the Report of the\r\n\r\nUniversity   Sector   enunciates   the   principles    of\r\n\r\nrobustness, diversity and health competition.  These  are\r\n\r\nprinciples  I  fully endorse.  The Report concludes  from\r\n\r\nthese three principles that there is no need for a fourth\r\n\r\nuniversity,  an idea first broached by another  committee\r\n\r\nheaded by the former Senior Minister of State Peter  Chen\r\n\r\nin  early  2002.   So with due respect, one  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  says  to start a fourth university, while  another\r\n\r\nsays, no, - all within a matter of nine months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of the university sector in its latest\r\n\r\nincarnation  is that of a multi-autonomous  campus,  NUS,\r\n\r\nand an enlarged NTU, rather than a fourth university.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that this is in order to derive economies  of\r\n\r\nscale from operations, branding, other start-up costs and\r\n\r\nminimise staff poaching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we saw very high profile defections of former\r\n\r\nTCS  stars,  actors  and  actresses  shortly  before  SPH\r\n\r\nMediaWorks was set up two to three years ago.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  stations  - MediaCorp and MediaWorks -  now  compete\r\n\r\nhead to head in the TV ratings, forcing huge improvements\r\n\r\nto  the  quality  of programming and promoting  the  film\r\n\r\nindustry.   The  chief beneficiary from this  competition\r\n\r\nhas,  without a question, been the consumer.  In economic\r\n\r\nterms,  society's welfare has improved, even if producers\r\n\r\nfind their monopoly cut down.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, poaching, in itself, is not necessarily a bad\r\n\r\nthing.   Existing  senior NUS staff can quite  easily  be\r\n\r\nseconded  permanently to start the fourth university,  as\r\n\r\nwas  the  case with the migration of some teaching  staff\r\n\r\nfrom  the NUS Business School and other faculties to SMU.\r\n\r\nI  fear  that the enhanced competition element is missing\r\n\r\nfrom this latest proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I must also confess I have trouble\r\n\r\ndeciphering what these terms \"autonomous\" and  a  \"multi-campus  university\"  really mean.   Will  the  respective\r\n\r\nPresidents of the three campuses have the independence to\r\n\r\nmake  decisions  on  admissions,  examination  standards,\r\n\r\nexpenditure,   etc?   Presumably,  the  NUS  multi-campus\r\n\r\nsystem  takes  its inspiration from the California  State\r\n\r\nUniversity   system.   But  the  various  University   of\r\n\r\nCalifornia campuses are generally so geographically apart\r\n\r\nand distinct that they operate almost as totally separate\r\n\r\nentities,  whereas the NUS system seems more like  branch\r\n\r\ncampuses  of  the  mother campus.   In  this  sense,  the\r\n\r\ncompetitive  landscape  has not  changed  much  from  the\r\n\r\npresent,  because  the new campuses at  Buona  Vista  and\r\n\r\nOutram are offering somewhat differentiated courses  from\r\n\r\nwhat the three existing universities are offering.  Also,\r\n\r\nNUS  (Buona Vista) seems to be positioned as the  premier\r\n\r\nresearch university above its lesser brethren in the  NUS\r\n\r\nsystem,  as  well as NTU and SMU.  Is this  streaming  at\r\n\r\nwork  at the tertiary level?  If so, then we should  also\r\n\r\naccept  that  not  all  public universities  are  created\r\n\r\nequal, and we are merely reflecting the spectrum of human\r\n\r\nability   by   having   both  top-tier   and   lower-tier\r\n\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be an incongruence here. At the\r\n\r\npolytechnic  level,  there are no  misgivings  about  the\r\n\r\nthird, fourth or even a fifth polytechnic.  But we reject\r\n\r\nthe  need for a fourth university.  Is it because we  are\r\n\r\nenforcing quality, by deliberately reducing the supply of\r\n\r\nuniversity places?  What about SIM?  It was touted to  be\r\n\r\nthe  seat of the fourth university at one time.   Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  could  review  the  idea  of  the  fourth\r\n\r\nuniversity as an institution for industry and practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Madam, the lack of professional\r\n\r\nrecognition of the NUS Building degree, and the  adoption\r\n\r\nof  the  modular system in NUS have made the Bachelor  of\r\n\r\nScience (Building) course redundant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS must not confuse the public by stating in its\r\n\r\nprospectus that the Bachelor of Science (Building) course\r\n\r\nhas  \"National  and  International  Accreditation\".   The\r\n\r\nqualification is not recognised as a professional  degree\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  For example, the Building and Construction\r\n\r\nAuthority  (BCA) has refused to include the qualification\r\n\r\nunder  its approved contractor registration system.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower does not recognise the degree to  be\r\n\r\na  qualified  site safety officer.  There is  no  Act  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to govern the professional conduct of  building\r\n\r\ngraduates.   Thus,  we  should not conduct  the  Building\r\n\r\ndegree  course and waste our limited resources.  Instead,\r\n\r\nI  would  propose that we convert the Bachelor of Science\r\n\r\n(Building)   course   into  an  engineering   course   in\r\n\r\nfacilities management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, as buildings become more complex, we need\r\n\r\nprofessionals who are trained in facilities management to\r\n\r\nmanage  our building development and management.  In  the\r\n\r\nUS,  facilities management is a growing industry and  has\r\n\r\nindeed  added much value in the development of  buildings\r\n\r\nand facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Ministry whether it will consider\r\n\r\nconverting the Bachelor of Science (Building) course into\r\n\r\na Bachelor of Engineering (Facilities Management) course?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Madam, I spoke quoting my personal experience last year\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  admission  criteria  for  the  NUS   MBA\r\n\r\nprogramme,  not for my own interest but for that  of  the\r\n\r\npublic in general.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government encourages training, retraining\r\n\r\nand  lifelong learning and going for higher qualification\r\n\r\nto  become  more skilled and professional, I am surprised\r\n\r\nthat  the  NUS'  admission  criteria  for  higher  degree\r\n\r\ncourses  restrict  the  number of  Singaporeans  who  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to  participate in each course.  When  I,  as  a\r\n\r\ngraduate  of the university and a former students'  union\r\n\r\nPresident and now an NCMP, was rejected for admission  to\r\n\r\nthe  NUS  MBA  programme, I was told that it was  because\r\n\r\nthere were too many qualified student applicants from the\r\n\r\nregion with higher GMAT scores.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the university seems to favour foreign students\r\n\r\nover  our  local citizens, where does it place our  local\r\n\r\ncitizen  population  with regard to self-improvement  and\r\n\r\nupgrading of their professional qualification in the name\r\n\r\nof lifelong learning?  Do they need to go overseas to get\r\n\r\nsuch  preferential treatment and admission?  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister can clarify on this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong Seh Hong, you can take your\r\n\r\ntwo cuts together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Madam, we have a good standard of\r\n\r\nmedical  healthcare in Singapore.  This is  in  no  small\r\n\r\npart   due   to   the   hard  work  of   our   healthcare\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  who have a reputation for  excellence  in\r\n\r\nthe  region.   However, in order to continue  to  be  the\r\n\r\nregional hub for medical excellence, and in our push  for\r\n\r\nthe  life  sciences,  we must have a  long-term  plan  to\r\n\r\ndevelop the human capital needed for this sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While training to be doctors, medical students are\r\n\r\nexposed  to  new developments in clinical  education  and\r\n\r\nmedical  research.  I am sure everyone here  would  agree\r\n\r\nthat  future medical doctors armed with knowledge of  the\r\n\r\nlatest developments in their field of study would  be  of\r\n\r\ngreat benefit to their patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I note that the report on the university\r\n\r\nsector  recommended  the setting up of  Graduate  Medical\r\n\r\nProgramme (GMP) leading to the MD degree, and the  School\r\n\r\nof  Health Sciences (SHS) at the Outram campus, while the\r\n\r\nMedical School training MBBS doctors would remain at  NUS\r\n\r\nKent Ridge.  May I ask the Minister what is the rationale\r\n\r\nof separating the Medical School from GMP and SHS?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would the Ministry ensure that institutions that\r\n\r\nprimarily  train  doctors,  nurses  and  therapists   for\r\n\r\nclinical  care, and institutions that focus primarily  on\r\n\r\nresearch,  are  working together in  close  synergy?   By\r\n\r\nworking   together  closely,  there   would   be   cross-fertilisation  of ideas.  Clinicians are exposed  to  the\r\n\r\nlatest development in research, while the researchers are\r\n\r\nexposed to the clinical challenges and problems faced  by\r\n\r\ntheir   counterparts.   They  could  then  work   closely\r\n\r\ntogether  to  apply research findings on the patients  or\r\n\r\nconduct  clinical  trials  or  research  together.   Some\r\n\r\nclinicians may also be enticed to become researchers, and\r\n\r\nvice versa.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to know the Ministry's long-term\r\n\r\nplan  to  meet the manpower requirements for our  medical\r\n\r\nand  life sciences sector.  I would also like to know  if\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  would  consider the proposal  to  put  the\r\n\r\nMedical  School, the Graduate Medical Programme  and  the\r\n\r\nSchool of Health Sciences together for them to enjoy  the\r\n\r\nbenefits of synergies and close collaborations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to take my next cut in Mandarin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Madam, the universities and\r\n\r\npolytechnics  are  institutes  of  higher  learning  that\r\n\r\nnurture the elite of our country and they are the pillars\r\n\r\nfor   the  future  economic  growth  of  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nemergence of China is an undeniable reality, and it  will\r\n\r\nsoon  become  the  driving force for the  growth  of  the\r\n\r\nglobal economy. Therefore, we should equip our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyoung people so that they can jump on the bandwagon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend of mine who is doing his MBA in the London\r\n\r\nBusiness  School sent me an email from London, expressing\r\n\r\nhis  worries. He said that we are beginning to  lose  our\r\n\r\nadvantages in China.  The Chinese people look down on our\r\n\r\nless-than-satisfactory standard of Chinese,  and they are\r\n\r\ncatching up on English.  We lack knowledge of the culture\r\n\r\nand  the  national situation of China, even the Americans\r\n\r\nare doing better than we do in this aspect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would urge the three universities in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to strengthen their teaching and  research  in\r\n\r\nChina's  social,  business and cultural environment,  and\r\n\r\nlaunch  a  series of courses and subjects to  attain  the\r\n\r\nfollowing objects:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) To enhance the university students' proficiency\r\n\r\nin  written  and spoken Chinese so that, in future,  when\r\n\r\nthere are exchanges with our counterparts in China,  they\r\n\r\nwould be able to write, read and communicate effectively;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) To enhance exchanges with the Chinese\r\n\r\nuniversities and their business community,  and  to  help\r\n\r\nour  students  understand China's  social,  cultural  and\r\n\r\nbusiness  environment  and the thinking  of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\npeople; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) To help our students to have a better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the foreign students from China here, so\r\n\r\nthat  they  would  not  discriminate  against  them.   In\r\n\r\nfuture,  if our students have the opportunity  to  go  to\r\n\r\nChina,  they  would  be able to adapt themselves  to  the\r\n\r\nenvironment in China better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many Chinese students in Singapore.

It was a Chinese university\r\n\r\nfounded  entirely  on funding by the Chinese  people  all\r\n\r\nover Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan donated the\r\n\r\nland  for the university site, and every brick and mortar\r\n\r\nof the campus was contributed by people from all walks of\r\n\r\nlife, including trishaw riders, coolies, dance hostesses,\r\n\r\nbarbers,  merchants, etc, many of them  giving  up  their\r\n\r\nlife  savings.  I  am  sure all  these  people  who  have\r\n\r\ncontributed  to  the founding of Nanyang University  will\r\n\r\nhave a special feeling for the university because it  was\r\n\r\nactually  the accumulation of all the blood and sweat  of\r\n\r\nthe  people and their aspiration.

The\r\n\r\nNantah campus\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  converted  to  the  Nanyang Technological  Institute\r\n\r\n(NTI),   which  was  subsequently  upgraded  to   Nanyang\r\n\r\nTechnological University (NTU).  At present, to cater  to\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of the time, NTU now offers courses  in  life\r\n\r\nsciences,     business    studies,    education,     mass\r\n\r\ncommunications, and not just purely technical courses. It\r\n\r\nwill   soon  start  an  Arts  Faculty,  to  make   it   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive university.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is no longer a university that conducts\r\n\r\npurely  technological studies, I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether he would consider taking out  the  word\r\n\r\n\"Technological\" from the name of the University, and  let\r\n\r\nthis   comprehensive  university  be  known  as  \"Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the old Nanyang and the new Nanyang are\r\n\r\ndifferent  but  since   this new  Nanyang  University  is\r\n\r\nstanding  on the site of the old Nanyang University,  let\r\n\r\nit  inherit  the  Nantah blood and spirit,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nNantah  spirit  of \"constantly striving to  be  stronger,\r\n\r\nvigorously  contending  to  improve,  and  self-reliance\"\r\n\r\ncontinues  to be manifested.  At the same time,  it  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to groom and nurture the Chinese elites.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  preserving the good Chinese culture and traditions,\r\n\r\nthe  spirit  could  also be used to respect  our   multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-cultural beliefs and to\r\n\r\npromote greater social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Madam, allow me to make some general comments regarding\r\n\r\nhigher  education before replying to some specific points\r\n\r\nraised by Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, currently, a strong and diverse post-secondary sector comprising ITE, Nanyang Academy of Fine\r\n\r\nArts,  LaSalle-SIA College of the Arts, polytechnics  and\r\n\r\nuniversities.  I thank Dr Michael Lim for sharing with us\r\n\r\nthe   wonderful  feedback  he  has  got   on   Ngee   Ann\r\n\r\nPolytechnic.   Indeed,  we  do  get  very  good  feedback\r\n\r\nregarding our polytechnics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our institutions of higher learning offer an array\r\n\r\nof academic and technical\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noptions to students.  Despite this economic downturn, the\r\n\r\nfears  which  have been highlighted by Mdm  Halimah,  our\r\n\r\ninstitutes of higher learning continue to be relevant and\r\n\r\nresponsive to our long-term economic and social goals for\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah asked whether MOE consults other\r\n\r\nagencies and, indeed, we do.  We do it in the context  of\r\n\r\nthe  National Manpower Council, and a number of agencies,\r\n\r\nincluding MTI, MOE, EDB, and other agencies sit together.\r\n\r\nOur manpower projections indicate that in 2010, the types\r\n\r\nof  jobs  required will require 65% of our  workforce  to\r\n\r\nhave  post-secondary  qualifications.  The  corresponding\r\n\r\nfigure  at  present  is only 39%.  We  must  continue  to\r\n\r\neducate  our  population. We should  not  be  myopic  and\r\n\r\nwrongly   conclude  from  this  current   slowdown   that\r\n\r\neducation  will count less in the future.   I  understand\r\n\r\nMdm Halimah's concern which was also expressed by Dr Wang\r\n\r\nKai  Yuen  about the employability of tertiary graduates.\r\n\r\nBut  an educational cache will outlast this recession and\r\n\r\npay   dividends   later.   Therefore,   to   meet   these\r\n\r\nchallenges,  the  post-secondary  sector  will  need   to\r\n\r\nsustain its quality, achieve greater diversity and expand\r\n\r\neducational opportunities.  My Ministry will press on and\r\n\r\nimprove  on  all  sectors related to  the  post-secondary\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, many Members took up the Minister's\r\n\r\ninvitation to visit ITE and many of you had expressed the\r\n\r\nadmiration  following  that visit.   You  have  seen  for\r\n\r\nyourselves    the   quality   of   the    training    and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.  But  ITE will  not  be  resting  on  its\r\n\r\nlaurels.   For  its next phase of development,  ITE  will\r\n\r\nregroup  its  current  10 campuses  into  three  regional\r\n\r\ncampuses over the next 15 years. The larger campuses will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  offer a full range of courses  and  provide\r\n\r\ncross-disciplinary training.  The Government will  invest\r\n\r\na  total of $800 million, excluding land cost, to develop\r\n\r\nthree  regional campuses. As the Minister has  said,  our\r\n\r\nfifth  polytechnic, the Republic Polytechnic,  will  open\r\n\r\nits  doors  this year. Besides increasing capacity,  this\r\n\r\ninstitution will offer more choices\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto those who wish to pursue a polytechnic education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1999, the Government has provided funding to\r\n\r\nNanyang  Academy of Fine Arts and LaSalle-SIA College  of\r\n\r\nthe  Arts  to develop their strengths in the western  and\r\n\r\ncontemporary  visual  arts and traditional  eastern  arts\r\n\r\nrespectively.   Both  institutions  are  currently  being\r\n\r\nredeveloped  and  are  expected to move  into  their  new\r\n\r\ncampuses in 2004 and 2006 respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two arts institutions - the recommendations for\r\n\r\nNTU  to  have a school of design, media and arts  -  will\r\n\r\ntrain the creative and artistic manpower to fuel and fill\r\n\r\nthe  growth  of the creative industry, as recommended  by\r\n\r\nthe  ERC.  Similarly, the university sector will continue\r\n\r\nin its efforts to improve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address the comments and queries raised\r\n\r\nby   several  Members  on  my  Committee's  proposal   to\r\n\r\nrestructure our university sector.  Members will  have  a\r\n\r\nsense  of the contrasting views expressed by Dr Amy  Khor\r\n\r\non  one side, and Dr Ong Seh Hong and Dr Wang Kai Yuen on\r\n\r\nthe  other  side, that there is a delicate  balance,  and\r\n\r\nindeed, a tension, that exists between quality, expansion\r\n\r\nand quantity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor has asked whether the targeted\r\n\r\nuniversity  cohort participation of 25%  is  the  correct\r\n\r\nnumber.  Our dictum and premium on this, which perhaps is\r\n\r\napt for her coming from the property sector, continue  to\r\n\r\nbe quality, quality, quality.  We begin with this premise\r\n\r\nthat  any  expansion to the university  sector  must  not\r\n\r\ndilute  present standards in Singapore.  Indeed, wherever\r\n\r\npossible,  quality  should  be  enhanced.  The  proximate\r\n\r\nindicators,  such  as  entry  scores  at  'A'  level   or\r\n\r\npolytechnic students' results and their 'O' level  grades\r\n\r\nindicate  that  we  can still maintain  standards  as  we\r\n\r\nexpand to 25%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us make no mistake, as was assumed by Dr\r\n\r\nWang  Kai  Yuen,  we would not be reluctant  to  decrease\r\n\r\ncohort  participation rate if standards fall.   MOE  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to monitor the attri-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntion  rate  that  Dr Ong spoke about,  grades  and  other\r\n\r\noutcome   indicators,  even  as  we  expand  the   cohort\r\n\r\nparticipation rate.  Dr Wang Kai Yuen and Dr Ong Seh  Ong\r\n\r\nare,  therefore, rightly concerned with the standards  of\r\n\r\nour graduates, and how competitive they will be, even  as\r\n\r\nwe  expand  our university intake to 25%, and  what  that\r\n\r\ndoes to the overall quality of our university sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may recall the Committee, and they have\r\n\r\nalluded  to it, chaired by Senior Minister of  State,  Mr\r\n\r\nPeter  Chen,  to  review upgrading opportunities  at  the\r\n\r\ndegree level.  It was an important and useful study which\r\n\r\nhighlighted that there exists a sufficiently  large  pool\r\n\r\nof  good  quality  students  to  sustain  a  high-quality\r\n\r\nuniversity education at the 25% cohort participation rate\r\n\r\n(CPR).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my University Sector Review Committee concurs\r\n\r\nwith  this recommendation.  From 1995-2000, there  was  a\r\n\r\nsteady  rise  in  the  'A' level performance  of  our  JC\r\n\r\nstudents. At the same time, our polytechnic students,  as\r\n\r\nhighlighted  by  Mr  Zainudin Nordin,  also  improved  in\r\n\r\nacademic quality.  The number of 'O' level students,  who\r\n\r\nare  eligible for admission into the Junior Colleges  but\r\n\r\nopted  to  go to the polytechnics, increased  from  about\r\n\r\n3,600 to 3,900.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen's Committee then recommended that\r\n\r\nproportionately, more polytechnic good students could  be\r\n\r\nadmitted to our universities.  In terms of basic academic\r\n\r\nquality,  the group of 3,900 students who could enter  JC\r\n\r\nbut  chose polytechnic education would be similar to  our\r\n\r\ntypical JC cohort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin Nordin has asked how far our proposed\r\n\r\nexpansion  addresses  these  aspirations  of  polytechnic\r\n\r\ngraduates.  Dr Wang Kai Yuen has also similarly expressed\r\n\r\nthis view. Arising from Mr Chen's Committee proposal,  we\r\n\r\nanticipate  that the proportion of polytechnic  graduates\r\n\r\nadmitted  into our universities will increase  three-fold\r\n\r\nafter  the  restructuring of the university sector.    As\r\n\r\nfor  working  adults, our universities will  continue  to\r\n\r\noffer degree upgrading\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunities  through continuing education  as  well  as\r\n\r\nfull-time study.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed concerns about our\r\n\r\nproposed  restructuring  of this  present  Committee,  as\r\n\r\nrecommended by the present Committee. Dr Amy  Khor  asked\r\n\r\nabout   the  pros  and  cons  of  setting  up  a   fourth\r\n\r\nuniversity, as contrasted to our present proposal.  These\r\n\r\nquestions  were  also asked by Dr Wang Kai  Yuen  and  Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth university was a mode suggested by Mr\r\n\r\nChen's Committee to accommodate that expansion.  Perhaps,\r\n\r\nthe  two  different Committees were bred under  different\r\n\r\ncircumstances   and,   therefore,   presented   different\r\n\r\noptions.   In  particular,  my  Committee  conducted  its\r\n\r\nreview  in lean times, and we were also concerned  as  to\r\n\r\nhow  stakeholders  would  accept the  fourth  university.\r\n\r\nThis  new  entity  would be without  the  benefit  of  an\r\n\r\nestablished  name  or  track  record.   Even   when   the\r\n\r\nstudents,  by  all  indicators,  will  be  of  equivalent\r\n\r\nstandard  to  those  entering existing  universities,  my\r\n\r\nCommittee feared that it will take a long time to achieve\r\n\r\nequal  acceptance compared to existing universities among\r\n\r\nstudents,  parents,  the  academic  community  and,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly, the employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not also forget that unlike and indeed\r\n\r\nperhaps similar to broadcast channels, the new university\r\n\r\nnot  only competes with our public universities but  also\r\n\r\nwith  foreign universities that have already  established\r\n\r\ntheir   presence  here  or  in  their  parent   campuses.\r\n\r\nSubstantial  resources  will  be  required  to   overcome\r\n\r\nprejudices inherently against fledgling institutions.  We\r\n\r\nfelt  that those resources will yield greater results  if\r\n\r\nwe  leverage  on  the  excellent reputation  of  existing\r\n\r\nuniversities.   It was not, as Dr Amy Khor  implied,  for\r\n\r\ncost-cutting  reasons that we propose this structure.  We\r\n\r\ntherefore  propose that NTU expand into  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nuniversity with greater complement of disciplines to take\r\n\r\nin more students. This will extend NTU's capabilities and\r\n\r\nprovide a broader and more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomprehensive undergraduate education to its students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS will expand into a multi-campus university, with\r\n\r\ntwo additional national institutions specialising in Life\r\n\r\nSciences,   and  a  second  in  Science  and  Technology.\r\n\r\nMembers, including Mr Iswaran and Dr Wang Kai Yuen,  have\r\n\r\nexpressed  concerns  whether  this  multi-campus  concept\r\n\r\nwould  lead  to  diversity. They  have  asked  about  the\r\n\r\ngovernance structures and what it means to be autonomous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these institutions will allow for greater\r\n\r\ndiversity, because of the way we will position  both  the\r\n\r\nexpertise,  the complement of students and  the  type  of\r\n\r\nfaculty   we   will  admit.  We  will  create  governance\r\n\r\nstructures  so  that they will have a certain  degree  of\r\n\r\nautonomy to be able to meet this objective.  But I  agree\r\n\r\nwith Members that implementation details are important to\r\n\r\nallow us to reach that objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We presented these views to both the academia and\r\n\r\nthe  industries, and to certain focus groups of students.\r\n\r\nThese  proposals were warmly endorsed by  the  Presidents\r\n\r\nand  the  academics  of  NUS and NTU.   Many  polytechnic\r\n\r\nstudents  also  welcome this proposal as  they  too  have\r\n\r\nconcerns regarding the image and acceptance of the fourth\r\n\r\nuniversity concept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin Nordin has asked whether NTU will gain\r\n\r\nmomentum from the proposed changes or slide back.  I must\r\n\r\nsay  that  since  the proposals were  released,  NTU  has\r\n\r\nresponded to these proposals with a relish and enthusiasm\r\n\r\nof  a  dolphin  thrown into a bigger lake.   How  far  it\r\n\r\nsucceeds,  of course, will ultimately depend on  how  NTU\r\n\r\ncan  exploit  the  new possibilities as it  broadens  its\r\n\r\neducational provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin Nordin has also proposed that NTU find a\r\n\r\nnew  name to reflect its identity, and this view was also\r\n\r\nshared  by  Mr  Ang Mong Seng.  I thank Mr  Ang  for  the\r\n\r\ndescription  of  the  Nantah spirit  and  the  historical\r\n\r\nevolution.  I could feel the resonance when he retold the\r\n\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed,  the  Nantah spirit lives in many people  and  in\r\n\r\nmany forms as we see it today.  I also thank him that  he\r\n\r\nagrees that NTU today, because of its transformation, has\r\n\r\nchanged  dramatically,  and is very  different  from  the\r\n\r\nprevious Nantah, and it has served it well.  However, the\r\n\r\nissue  of  naming  is  really  linked  to  what  kind  of\r\n\r\nuniversity the NTU aspires to be.  This is something that\r\n\r\nshould  be  decided  by  NTU,  the  NTU  community,   the\r\n\r\nstudents, the Alumni, and the faculty as a whole.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong has asked why we are separating the existing\r\n\r\nmedical  school  from the new provisions of  Medical  and\r\n\r\nAllied  Health Science Education at NUS (Outram).   There\r\n\r\nare  several reasons.  First, the current medical  school\r\n\r\nis  quite large by international standards, and any scope\r\n\r\nof   future  expansion  will  be  limited.   Second,  the\r\n\r\nproposed   graduate  medical  programme   will   have   a\r\n\r\ncurriculum   distinct  from  the  present   undergraduate\r\n\r\nmedical  course.  A distinctive GMP teaching  methodology\r\n\r\nwill  inject  greater diversity into  our  local  medical\r\n\r\ntraining  and,  in  the longer term,  the  local  medical\r\n\r\nprofession.   This,  we felt, was best  achieved  by  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of an institution separate and independent  of\r\n\r\nthe MBBS programme currently offered by NUS (Kent Ridge).\r\n\r\nThird,  as  he  rightly alluded to, the  involvement  and\r\n\r\nclose proximity of the Singapore General Hospital to  NUS\r\n\r\n(Outram)  will allow the programme to leverage  on  SGH's\r\n\r\nconsiderable clinical expertise for teaching, as well  as\r\n\r\nfor the School of Health Sciences.  This would foster and\r\n\r\nspur  more  translational  and patient-oriented  research\r\n\r\nthat  is  essential  for both healthcare  needs  and  the\r\n\r\nnation's  biomedical  science  initiatives.   This   will\r\n\r\ncomplement and synergise with the parallel development of\r\n\r\nthe Biopolis.  I also want to point out that they will be\r\n\r\noffering  diversity  and there will  be  the  element  of\r\n\r\ncompetition  with one another.  The GMP and the  existing\r\n\r\nNUS  undergraduate programmes could still complement  and\r\n\r\nenhance  each other even if they are housed  in  separate\r\n\r\nplaces.  There must\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  inter-campus connectivity for students and  faculties\r\n\r\nwithin the multi-campus university structure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have raised queries regarding university\r\n\r\nadmission system and other aspects relating to design and\r\n\r\nstaffing.   Mr  Zainudin has recommended  that  staff  be\r\n\r\nallowed to take breaks and other appointments which  will\r\n\r\ngear  them better to teach.  Mr Iswaran has commented  on\r\n\r\nwhat  the  proposals for the new tenure and  compensation\r\n\r\nschemes would be.  Dr Amy Khor has commented on the ratio\r\n\r\nof local and foreign staff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, NUS has formed a task force to examine the\r\n\r\nissues   relating   to  possible  enhancements   to   the\r\n\r\nuniversity's policies on tenure and compensation.  One of\r\n\r\nthe  primary issues the task force is looking at  is  how\r\n\r\nbest  to  provide  for more options for  faculty,  as  Mr\r\n\r\nZainudin  has suggested, to exercise greater  flexibility\r\n\r\nand   freedom  to  faculty  members  to  pursue   various\r\n\r\nactivities during the off-season months, after they  have\r\n\r\nfulfilled  their  teaching and research responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe  task  force  is  due to submit  its  report  to  NUS\r\n\r\nmanagement  only  by  July  2003.   At  this   point,   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  the issues are being floated for  exploration\r\n\r\nand discussion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of local and foreign staff, in both\r\n\r\nuniversities, NUS and NTU combined, there are about 1,600\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens and PR staff and about 1,000  foreign\r\n\r\nstaff members.  We are quite neutral in terms of both the\r\n\r\nweightage  and spread.  I think what is important  is  to\r\n\r\nhave a mixture so that the students can benefit from  the\r\n\r\ndiversity of faculty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether NTU and NUS have adequate applied\r\n\r\nresearch  and  practical  aspects  and  nexus  with   the\r\n\r\nindustry,  the  Ministry broadly is  now  moving  towards\r\n\r\nestablishing  systems for output and outcome  indicators,\r\n\r\nas  well  as not only measuring input levels.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  we  want to move the universities to  measure  by\r\n\r\nthemselves  and to engage the stakeholders, whether  they\r\n\r\nare  graduates, industry or employers, for themselves  to\r\n\r\nget a sense of how they are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoing,  vis-a-vis the stakeholders, and  thereby  respond\r\n\r\nadequately to the signals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I thank Dr Ong for moving the cut to add to\r\n\r\nour  budget.   I  would endorse his cut  and  relay  that\r\n\r\nsentiment  to the Ministry and the Minister for  Finance.\r\n\r\nI  am  heartened  that  a number of Members  have  voiced\r\n\r\nsupport  for  the  findings  of  my  Committee.   If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment accepts the recommendations, it would  be  the\r\n\r\nstart  of another exciting phase of development  for  our\r\n\r\nuniversities.  If we succeed, and I believe we shall, our\r\n\r\nuniversities will truly be Singapore's strategic  assets,\r\n\r\nfulfilling  the  objective of human  capital  development\r\n\r\nthrough  education,  ideas and  wealth  creation  through\r\n\r\nresearch  and  international  branding  to  entrench  our\r\n\r\nrepute as a keynote in the global education landscape.  I\r\n\r\nwill address other issues on university education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong has asked how our universities are preparing\r\n\r\nour  graduates  to ride on China's economic  growth.   We\r\n\r\nagree that this is an important development that we  must\r\n\r\naddress.  A number of initiatives are already underway at\r\n\r\nthe  tertiary level to strengthen the awareness of  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans about China and China-related issues.  These\r\n\r\ninclude  an exchange programme for outstanding university\r\n\r\nstudents  between PRC and Singapore, which would commence\r\n\r\nthis year.  Each year, 50 outstanding university students\r\n\r\nfrom  each  country would be selected to  participate  in\r\n\r\nthat  programme.  During their two weeks  in  China,  our\r\n\r\nstudents  would have the opportunities to  interact  with\r\n\r\nChinese  leaders, officials, academics and students  from\r\n\r\ntop Chinese universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS is also developing a China initiative to enhance\r\n\r\nour  students' appreciation and understanding  of  China.\r\n\r\nThis initiative includes dual degree programmes with  top\r\n\r\ninstitutions   like   Beijing   University   and   Xinhua\r\n\r\nUniversity,   student  exchanges  with  leading   Chinese\r\n\r\nuniversities,  a satellite campus in China and  extensive\r\n\r\nresearch collaborations.  NTU is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  moving  in  that same direction.  It  has  recently\r\n\r\nentered  into  partnership with the  Shanghai  Qiao  Dong\r\n\r\nUniversity  to  offer MBA programmes.   To  complete  the\r\n\r\npicture, the polytechnics are also getting into the game.\r\n\r\nOn  their  part,  they will conduct  basic  and  business\r\n\r\nMandarin  classes, as well as modules on Chinese history,\r\n\r\nculture  and  development in Mandarin.  They  also  offer\r\n\r\noverseas   industrial  training  programmes  in   various\r\n\r\nChinese  universities and companies  and  staff  exchange\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   And,  if you heard Dr  Michael  Lim,  these\r\n\r\nefforts  have  already been paying dividends.   ITE  gets\r\n\r\ninto  the  act as well.  It conducts overseas attachments\r\n\r\nfor  its  students and staff and will be  introducing  an\r\n\r\nelective Business Mandarin from this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also spoke on the role of our universities in\r\n\r\ntraining  our  Chinese professionals.   Our  universities\r\n\r\nwould  continue  to  take  on this  role.   In  NUS,  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  Chinese  Studies  offers  more  than   50\r\n\r\nundergraduate  courses  in five  major  areas  of  study,\r\n\r\nnamely,  Chinese Linguistics, Chinese Literature, Chinese\r\n\r\nHistory,   Chinese  Philosophy  and  Translation.    This\r\n\r\ndepartment  also  offers PhDs and Masters  programmes  in\r\n\r\nChinese  studies.  NTU - Mr Ang Mong Seng has touched  on\r\n\r\nthat  -  has  a Centre for Chinese Language and  Culture,\r\n\r\nwhich  conducts general courses in Chinese  language  and\r\n\r\nculture,  plans  the implementation of minor  degree  and\r\n\r\npost-graduate degree programmes in Chinese, and  conducts\r\n\r\nresearch.   In  addition, since July 2001, NIE  has  been\r\n\r\noffering  the  Bachelor  of Arts  Education  for  Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage  and Literature specialisation.  The  course  is\r\n\r\nestablished specifically to train the teaching of Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage  at  the  primary school  level.   The  proposed\r\n\r\nSchool  of  Humanities and Social Sciences for  NTU  will\r\n\r\ncomplement this initiative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Mr Chia for his altruistic call because he\r\n\r\nsaid that from his personal experience, he felt that  NUS\r\n\r\nfavours  or  admits non-Singaporeans to the MBA  courses.\r\n\r\nHe  has brought up this point so that others like him, in\r\n\r\nhis words, \"former\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunion  President and NCMP will not suffer\"  -  a  similar\r\n\r\nfate,  I  presume.  Madam, entry to the NUS MBA programme\r\n\r\nis highly competitive.  It is rated as one of the top MBA\r\n\r\nprogrammes   in  Asia.   The  general  requirements   for\r\n\r\nadmission are a good undergraduate degree with  a  strong\r\n\r\nacademic record, relevant working experience and,  as  he\r\n\r\nhas  rightly  pointed  out,  a  good  General  Management\r\n\r\nAdmission Test (GMAT).  All entrants, I presume, have  to\r\n\r\nmeet these standards.  Last year, when he applied, it was\r\n\r\nnot  quite  a  lot of foreigners.  It was about  28  non-Singaporeans,  to  be exact, that were admitted  to  this\r\n\r\ncourse,  and  that formed about 30% of  the  intake.   In\r\n\r\nother words, the majority of 70% were Singaporeans.  This\r\n\r\nfigure  of  30%  is quite normal for MBA programmes  and,\r\n\r\nindeed, many hundreds of Singaporeans who themselves  are\r\n\r\nforeign  students attending MBA courses  in  UK  and  USA\r\n\r\nyearly  will  tell you that business schools have  higher\r\n\r\nrates  of  foreign  participation  to  achieve  a  strong\r\n\r\ninternational  flavour and to allow  networking.   It  is\r\n\r\nthis  very  diversity of talented people that  makes  MBA\r\n\r\nprogrammes attractive and successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am puzzled by one aspect, because I do not\r\n\r\nunderstand why Mr Chia is upset with the foreign students\r\n\r\nwho  got into the MBA course.  I can understand him,  and\r\n\r\nempathise,  if he is upset that his undergraduate  degree\r\n\r\ndid   not  meet  admission  requirements.   I  can   also\r\n\r\nunderstand  if  he  is upset that being  a  former  union\r\n\r\nPresident  and  NCMP  did not count  enough  as  relevant\r\n\r\nworking  experience,  even though it  clearly  shows  his\r\n\r\nleadership qualities.  He did not tell us if he  met  the\r\n\r\nGMAT  standards.   But,  even  if  he  did  not,  I   can\r\n\r\nunderstand why he would be upset, as this may  not  be  a\r\n\r\nsingular measure of MBA material.  But, Madam, why should\r\n\r\nhe  be upset with foreigners?  Members will remember that\r\n\r\nMr  Chia had also spoken against Contact Singapore trying\r\n\r\nto  recruit  foreign talents to Singapore to improve  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  Madam, Mr Chia's xenophobia,  like  all\r\n\r\nphobias, is irrational, misplaced and unjustified.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants for this MBA course are selected by\r\n\r\nmerit.  So, even if the class had no foreigners, in other\r\n\r\nwords,   they   were  all  Singaporeans,  the   admission\r\n\r\nstandards would still have to be fulfilled.  I hope  that\r\n\r\nhe   is  not  implying  that  an  NCMP  should  be  given\r\n\r\npreference over others.  Indeed, Mr Chia did not get into\r\n\r\nthe  course  not  because of foreigners, but  because  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  with better qualifications.   But  Mr  Chia\r\n\r\nshould not be upset with these Singaporeans who got  into\r\n\r\nthe  MBA  class and displaced him.  To be fair  to  them,\r\n\r\nthey  could  not have prior knowledge that he,  a  former\r\n\r\nunion   President  and  NCMP,  was  also  applying   that\r\n\r\nparticular year.  If they did, I am sure they would  have\r\n\r\ndeferred.   But as the Ministry that encourages  lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning,  I  would encourage Mr Chia not to lose  heart.\r\n\r\nThere are many other MBA courses in Singapore that he can\r\n\r\napply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note Dr Teo Ho Pin's suggestion to convert NUS'\r\n\r\nBachelor   of   Science  (Building)  to  a  Bachelor   of\r\n\r\nEngineering  (Facilities  Management)  course.   We  will\r\n\r\nrelay the suggestion to the appropriate faculty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to address Mr Inderjit's earlier\r\n\r\nsuggestion to encourage local distance learning providers\r\n\r\nto become full universities.  We agree.  My Committee did\r\n\r\nagree  that private universities in Singapore be  allowed\r\n\r\nto complement the 25% CPR provided by our three publicly-funded  universities.  So if SIM feels  that  they  would\r\n\r\nlike to expand their cohort, they are free to do so.   We\r\n\r\nagree  with him and Dr Amy Khor's point that the  private\r\n\r\nuniversities'  presence  can enhance  the  diversity  and\r\n\r\ncompetition within this sector.  However, to maintain our\r\n\r\nreputation  as  a  premium educational hub,  any  private\r\n\r\nuniversity wishing to establish itself in Singapore  must\r\n\r\nbe one of high quality and high international standing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Madam, point of\r\n\r\nclarification.  First of all, I am expressing  a  concern\r\n\r\nabout admission and not that I am upset.  So I would very\r\n\r\nmuch  appreciate the Minister for not putting words  into\r\n\r\nmy mouth and saying that I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nam  upset.  The other point is I am not xenophobic  about\r\n\r\nforeigners coming to study in Singapore, but rather  when\r\n\r\nI called up and asked about the criteria for admission, I\r\n\r\nwas  told  over the phone that it was because there  were\r\n\r\nmany foreigners who applied and there was no space for us\r\n\r\n-  it is not so much that I applied - and so Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndo not get to go in for that matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Madam, I am quite heartened to hear\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Chia is not upset.  That makes my  job  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry that encourages lifelong learning easier.  As to\r\n\r\nthe  comment  that  he  was  told  that  many  foreigners\r\n\r\napplied, that is a generic point.  But, really the  point\r\n\r\nis that he did not get into it because other Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwith adequate qualifications did.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Madam, what shapes society? I\r\n\r\nbelieve it is ultimately the underlying value system that\r\n\r\ndetermines the shape and future of our society.  Hence, I\r\n\r\nask, what then is the value system embraced by our future\r\n\r\nleaders today?  Answer: the onslaught of popular culture,\r\n\r\nmore  than any single force in the form of music, movies,\r\n\r\ntelevision,  reality  shows,  etc,  predominates  as   an\r\n\r\ninfluential agent that moulds the character,  values  and\r\n\r\nbeliefs  of  the  audience, particularly  the  young  and\r\n\r\nimpressionable   minds.    With   technology   and   keen\r\n\r\ncompetition,  production  becomes  an  extension  of  the\r\n\r\ncreator's  pontifications  of  truths  and  values   that\r\n\r\nstretches  beyond  the  imaginable but,  through  skilful\r\n\r\njuxtaposition,  portrays  them  in  realistic  light   to\r\n\r\nimpress  and  make  believe.   Over  a  period  of  time,\r\n\r\nimpressionable minds do believe.  Shows like  \"Temptation\r\n\r\nIsland\"  and  \"Bachelor\", songs  like,  \"Cleaning  Up  My\r\n\r\nCloset\" by Eminent or \"Biscuits, Chocolate, Starfish\" all\r\n\r\nhave the effect of transcending matters of importance  to\r\n\r\na  point of desacralising almost everything.  Other shows\r\n\r\nteach  selfishness and to each his own.  In  short,  over\r\n\r\ntime,  the  influence  of  popular  culture  may  corrode\r\n\r\nsociety's  sense of morality and values, if  it  has  not\r\n\r\nalready done so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this modern age of cable channels and the\r\n\r\nInternet,  we cannot stop the onslaught of the media  and\r\n\r\npopular  culture.  We can, however, imbue in our young  a\r\n\r\nstrong  foundation of value system through our  education\r\n\r\nsystem,  so  that they will be able to make  sound  value\r\n\r\njudgments.   Values  like  care  and  share,  values   of\r\n\r\nmorality and filial piety, values like frugality and hard\r\n\r\nwork,  values like respect for the elderly and  authority\r\n\r\n-   they are all pillars of our society.  Obviously, this\r\n\r\nresponsibility  falls on all shoulders  of  society,  but\r\n\r\nschools do have a big role to play, as our children spend\r\n\r\na  big  part of their time in school.  I am heartened  to\r\n\r\nknow  that  schools do have school mottoes  that  expound\r\n\r\ncertain  values,  but I am mindful that the  emphasis  on\r\n\r\nacademic  excellence does not overwhelm  these  important\r\n\r\npillars of society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, our young today will be the driving force of\r\n\r\ntomorrow.   Given  the  more than 100  cases  of  teenage\r\n\r\nabortions  per month, young drug offenders and  spotlight\r\n\r\non  juvenile  delinquency, I am  afraid  that  unless  we\r\n\r\nquickly immunise, not insulate, our young, we will have a\r\n\r\nsociety of questionable values and behaviour.  May I  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the state of our moral and value education\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How much emphasis is given to moral and value\r\n\r\neducation in terms of hours in the time table and  method\r\n\r\nof teaching?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What is the Ministry's stand on using moral\r\n\r\neducation hours for revisions and catch-ups of examinable\r\n\r\nor academic subjects when the need arises?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Has MOE any plans to step up on values and moral\r\n\r\neducation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am anxious about the shape of our future to\r\n\r\ncome.   In the light of the pending war, let me quote  Dr\r\n\r\nViktor  Frankl,  a  renowned psychologist,  who  survived\r\n\r\nAuschwitz:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am convinced that the gas chambers of Auschwitz,\r\n\r\nTreblinka  and Maidanek were ultimately prepared  not  in\r\n\r\nsome ministry or other in Berlin, but rather at the desks\r\n\r\nand  in  the  lecture halls of nihilistic scientists  and\r\n\r\nphilosophers.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  other words, if Dr Viktor Frankl was right,  then  it\r\n\r\nmight  be worthwhile to remind ourselves that the impetus\r\n\r\nfor  the  Holocaust did not come from a military strategy\r\n\r\nas  much as it did from the educated elite, unblushing in\r\n\r\ntheir philosophies, on mankind.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Madam, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  speak  on   character development.   Under  our\r\n\r\neducational  system, every effort has been  made  through\r\n\r\nour   co-curricular  activities  (CCAs)  to  develop  the\r\n\r\ncharacter of our students.  But what worries me  is  that\r\n\r\nco-curricular activities are not compulsory.    How  does\r\n\r\nthe MOE ensure that a character development programme  is\r\n\r\nimplemented  in  the  schools?  We  should  attach  equal\r\n\r\nweightage  to academic and character development.   Equal\r\n\r\nemphasis  should  be  given  to  these  two  aspects   of\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is character development so important? At this\r\n\r\ntime  of economic downturn, and with the world in such  a\r\n\r\nstate  of instability and uncertainty, we should  develop\r\n\r\nthe  character  of our students so that they  would  have\r\n\r\nenough courage and perseverance to face adversity.   This\r\n\r\nkind  of courage and perseverance cannot be learned  from\r\n\r\nthe  textbooks.  It has to be cultivated through  various\r\n\r\nteam activities, physical education and some of the CCAs.\r\n\r\nWe   need   to  enhance  the  students'  self-discipline,\r\n\r\nconstantly striving to improve themselves and to be self-reliant.   They should learn to sacrifice their  personal\r\n\r\ninterests  for  larger objectives, to put  nation  before\r\n\r\nself, to build up team spirit and to nurture the love for\r\n\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our homes today, we have domestic maids to take\r\n\r\ncare  of  all the household chores, and we have  imported\r\n\r\nhundreds   of   thousands  of  foreign   workers.    Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  feel that we should not be  doing  all  the\r\n\r\nmanual  work.   This type of attitude is wrong.  We  must\r\n\r\ncultivate the right attitude for labour in our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  must also cultivate our students to be curious, to be\r\n\r\ninquisitive  and  to  be  eager  to  learn.   All   these\r\n\r\nattributes  can be cultivated through mass  participation\r\n\r\nin various team activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there should be a joint effort among the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  society, schools and the families.   In  our\r\n\r\nSouth  West CDC, our Youth and Sports Committee  and  the\r\n\r\nFamily  and  Children Committee have  been  working  very\r\n\r\nclosely   with   the   schools  and   voluntary   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations in our area.  We want to share our  limited\r\n\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also consider using mother tongue to teach\r\n\r\nmoral education.  When I was in secondary school, I  read\r\n\r\nthe  Zhengqi  Ge (Song of Righteousness) written  by  the\r\n\r\ngreat  patriotic  poet, Wen Tianxiang.  It  left  a  very\r\n\r\nprofound impression in my mind. At that time, I asked  my\r\n\r\nfather  if  I  had  to  face a situation  like  what  Wen\r\n\r\nTianxiang was facing, should I die or should I surrender?\r\n\r\nMy  father  said  that  I should choose  to  die.   These\r\n\r\ntouching  stories of great people in history  are  deeply\r\n\r\nrooted  in  our minds, even decades later.  If our  young\r\n\r\npeople  could be exposed to all these classics, it  would\r\n\r\nhelp   them  to  make  sound  judgement  and  well-guided\r\n\r\ndecisions in critical times.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Madam, as we strive for academic\r\n\r\nexcellence, we must not lose sight of the need  to  mould\r\n\r\nthe  character of our children, especially  during  their\r\n\r\nformative  years.  I would like to ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nelaborate  on  the  Ministry's  effort  in  building  and\r\n\r\nstrengthening  the character of our students.   What  are\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's  programmes?  How are  the  progress  and\r\n\r\nachievement  of these programmes monitored and  measured?\r\n\r\nAnd  how are our teachers prepared and trained to deliver\r\n\r\nthe subject?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, three aspects of character development are of\r\n\r\ngreat   importance   -  the  right  value   system,   the\r\n\r\nleadership quality and the strive for excellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on right value system. We must impart the\r\n\r\nright value system to the next\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngeneration.  We must teach them to know right from wrong,\r\n\r\nto   be  responsible,  to  be  accountable  and,  equally\r\n\r\nimportant,  to be caring.  These are basic  qualities  of\r\n\r\nhumanity.  Without them, our children will grow up to  be\r\n\r\na liability rather than an asset to our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, leadership quality. Some day, we will hand\r\n\r\nover  to  our  children  the future  of  our  nation  and\r\n\r\nourselves.  It is therefore crucial that we must  develop\r\n\r\nthe leadership quality in our children. We must inculcate\r\n\r\nin  them the adventure and pioneering spirit, so that  we\r\n\r\ncan  produce great leaders in politics, in business,  the\r\n\r\nacademia and in the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, strive for excellence. We must develop in\r\n\r\nour  children the desire to learn, the desire to  improve\r\n\r\nand  the  desire  to  excel.  They  must  not  be  easily\r\n\r\ncontented  with  themselves.  They  must  adopt  lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning as part of their lifestyle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to ask the Minister to elaborate\r\n\r\nhow  these subjects are taught in the schools.   I  would\r\n\r\nalso  like  to  urge  the Ministry  to  explore  ways  to\r\n\r\nencourage     greater    participation    of    community\r\n\r\norganisations and voluntary welfare organisations in  the\r\n\r\nprogramme, as it will inject greater professionalism  and\r\n\r\nrealism.   We should also develop programmes  that  would\r\n\r\ninvolve  parents, as character building is not a job  for\r\n\r\nthe  school  alone.  Parents must also feel  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nownership  of  the  challenge.   We  must  place  greater\r\n\r\nemphasis on character building as part of the curriculum.\r\n\r\nIt is a need to have subject, not a good to have subject.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Madam, the Ministry's\r\n\r\nmission statement states, amongst other things:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'to bring out the best in our young by developing\r\n\r\nthem   into   useful  and  responsible  individuals   and\r\n\r\ncitizens.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Desired Outcomes include, inter alia, 'that\r\n\r\nour  young  will  be morally upright, culturally  rooted,\r\n\r\nconstituents of a gracious society'.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Character development among students is the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  (a)  the  student  himself;  (b)  the\r\n\r\nparents  and family members of the student; (c) his  peer\r\n\r\ngroups;  and (d) the teachers of the student.

How  about  encouragement  in  the\r\n\r\nlearning  of languages to create the Singapore  character\r\n\r\nof  our  students,  like  learning  Malay,  Mandarin  and\r\n\r\ndialects,  Indian languages, including  Tamil  and  other\r\n\r\ndialects?   How  about languages of ASEAN countries  like\r\n\r\nThai,  Vietnamese,  Tagalog, etc, to get  to  know  ASEAN\r\n\r\nlanguages  and  cultures, so that we have  a  variety  of\r\n\r\noptions?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there programmes in place for character\r\n\r\ndevelopment  dealing  with ethical and  moral  values  on\r\n\r\ncriminal laws, so that they would know what our standards\r\n\r\nof behaviour should be in life, and of right and wrong on\r\n\r\nfinancial matters, including value of money, respect  for\r\n\r\nacquisition of wealth honestly and through hard work?  Do\r\n\r\nwe  have  classes  for character development  which  will\r\n\r\nimprove their responsibility and duties at home to  carry\r\n\r\nout  household  work  and responsibilities,  cooking  and\r\n\r\ncleaning  of  homes, gardening, etc, duties, respect  and\r\n\r\ncare  for  the  elderly, their parents  and  grandparents\r\n\r\nespecially,  duty  to  care for the less  privileged  and\r\n\r\nsick,  and duty to protect and care for animals?  If  all\r\n\r\nthe  above  programmes are available  or,  in  some  way,\r\n\r\nenhanced,  our children would be good citizens with  good\r\n\r\ncharacter,  and  that will be good for Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\nlong term.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Madam, the National Education\r\n\r\nProgramme  (NEP)  is  also  an  important  part  of   our\r\n\r\ncurriculum. Through the NEP, we endeavour to inculcate  a\r\n\r\nsense  of belonging, a sense of ownership and a sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility towards the nation.  Through the  NEP,  we\r\n\r\ncultivate  a  desire for peace and harmony  in  a  multi-racial  and multi-religious society.  The NEP  is  a  key\r\n\r\ninstrument  through which we create a  national  identity\r\n\r\namong the young Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  elaborate on the NEP programme.  How is  the  subject\r\n\r\ndelivered  in  the schools?  Has our method  of  delivery\r\n\r\nbeen  effective?  It is good to have a comprehensive  NEP\r\n\r\nprogramme.   But if the delivery process is  ineffective,\r\n\r\nthe  efforts  would  be in vain.  How  are  the  teachers\r\n\r\ntrained  to  deliver  the subject?  The  NIE  would  have\r\n\r\nincluded  this  in the teachers' training.   But  is  the\r\n\r\ntraining appropriate and adequate?  How do we measure the\r\n\r\neffectiveness and achievements of the NEP?   The  success\r\n\r\nof  the  programme must be measured against  the  desired\r\n\r\noutcomes.   Are  there benchmarks and how  well  have  we\r\n\r\nachieved our objective?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also be grateful if the Minister would let\r\n\r\nus know whether there are plans to revise the NEP to take\r\n\r\ninto  account recent events and issues, such as terrorism\r\n\r\nand  international relations.  While NEP is not  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  core subjects, we must not take the subject lightly.\r\n\r\nThe  effectiveness of the NEP will determine  whether  we\r\n\r\nwill succeed in developing a strong and cohesive people.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Madam, in the dialogue sessions\r\n\r\nconducted  by  the Feedback Unit on social cohesion,  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  racial  interaction among our  children  is  a\r\n\r\nrecurrent theme. Participants are concerned with  how  to\r\n\r\ninculcate  tolerance and understanding  of  each  other's\r\n\r\ncultures and habits in our young.  In fact, some of  them\r\n\r\ndo  not  like  the word \"tolerance\".  Tolerance  connotes\r\n\r\nsomething that it cannot be helped with.  They\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprefer  the word \"acceptance\".  Acceptance is  a  two-way\r\n\r\nstreet.   It  is not just for the majority to  understand\r\n\r\nthe  culture and the values of the minority, but also for\r\n\r\nthe  minority  to appreciate the need to give  and  take.\r\n\r\nLiving in a multi-racial society, we must learn to accept\r\n\r\nthe  culture and habits of our neighbours which could  be\r\n\r\nvery different from our own.  To achieve this, most of us\r\n\r\nwill  agree that interaction among our young is the  best\r\n\r\napproach.   Ideally,  all our children  should  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to intermingle with children  of  the  other\r\n\r\nraces while growing up - play together, eat together from\r\n\r\nyoung.   In  that  way, there is little  opportunity  for\r\n\r\nextremist views to take root.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, currently, the racial composition in many of\r\n\r\nour  schools  does not reflect the racial composition  of\r\n\r\nour  population.  Thus, there is a need to find  ways  to\r\n\r\nforce   a  greater  interaction  among  our  pupils   and\r\n\r\nstudents.   I  believe  one of  the  best  approaches  is\r\n\r\nthrough  sports,  such as soccer  and  hockey.   I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest that MOE explore organising regular sports meets,\r\n\r\nperhaps with the Community Development Councils, so  that\r\n\r\nchildren have greater opportunity to interact.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Madam, I am concerned,\r\n\r\nlike Dr Gan and Dr Wang, with how students relate to each\r\n\r\nother  in schools.  I am aware that the Ministry has  got\r\n\r\nits   National  Education  Programme,  civic  and   moral\r\n\r\neducation  programme, social studies, etc,  in  place  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  there  is some kind of discussion  on  this\r\n\r\ntopic.   The  Ministry has also proactively  set  up  the\r\n\r\nCommittee on Strengthening Racial Harmony and with  that,\r\n\r\nwe   have   initiatives  like  Racial  Harmony  Day   and\r\n\r\nInternational Friendship Day; and research,  exhibitions,\r\n\r\nperformances  of  a  high standard.  They  are  all  good\r\n\r\nmeasures that have been put in place.  However, today,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  raise  this question  of  whether  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  are adequate enough, the same concern expressed\r\n\r\nby  Mr Gan.  How does the Ministry ensure that these  are\r\n\r\nnot   just  cosmetic  endeavours  and  that  we  are  not\r\n\r\nscrapping the surface, but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing  deeper into the psyche of the students  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there is some kind of realistic acceptance of  each\r\n\r\nother's cultural differences?  Like Mr Gan, I would  also\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Ministry how are teachers sensitised  to\r\n\r\nthese  ethnic differences that we have, and what are  the\r\n\r\ncoping  strategies that they can employ in  dealing  with\r\n\r\nparents or children who display such behaviours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instilling values takes a long time, and I think\r\n\r\nprincipals   play  the  primary  role  in  this   aspect.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  do wonder whether the Ministry's  policy  of\r\n\r\nrotating  principals  every five years  runs  counter  to\r\n\r\ngiving  it  enough time to instill a good  value  system,\r\n\r\nespecially  in this area.  Perhaps, this is something  to\r\n\r\nthink about, again, over here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also ask whether it is time to introduce\r\n\r\nwithin  the  National Education Programme a component  on\r\n\r\nmulticulturism, bearing in mind that one in four students\r\n\r\nhere is a foreigner and moving overseas will also be part\r\n\r\nof  the  entrepreneurship drive.  I think it is important\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans to know that there are  other  cultural\r\n\r\ndifferences beyond our shores.  Lest you think that I  am\r\n\r\nexaggerating  on this aspect of discontent  -  to  use  a\r\n\r\nmilder  term  perhaps  - let me  cite  the  work  of  two\r\n\r\nacademics which was posted on the IPS website ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Braema, you would have to wrap up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> I am winding up.

I  end  off  by\r\n\r\njust citing this example.  A Malay student says that  the\r\n\r\nform  teacher  in  teaching  him  Mathematics  does   the\r\n\r\nexplanation in Chinese.  This is anecdotal.   But  if  we\r\n\r\nhave  come to this stage, I think it is beyond skin  deep\r\n\r\nand we have to look deeper into it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, the Ministry's\r\n\r\nDesired Outcomes include,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namongst  other things that our young would be  respectful\r\n\r\nof  family,  community and country; and be  citizens  who\r\n\r\nbelieve   in   our  principles  of  multi-racialism   and\r\n\r\nmeritocracy.  Does the Ministry have programmes to  bring\r\n\r\nabout an ideal environment for social cohesion, including\r\n\r\nracial  and  religious integration?   To  appreciate  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  ways  of major races, namely, Malay,  Chinese,\r\n\r\nIndian,  Eurasian, and also other races in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nto respect their different cultures, social and religious\r\n\r\nhabits and practices, could the Ministry consider greater\r\n\r\nsocial cohesion in primary, secondary, post-secondary and\r\n\r\ntertiary institutions by having the following programmes:\r\n\r\n(1) from Primary 1 to Primary 6, perhaps, have simple and\r\n\r\nbasic  classes  on  origins  of  different  races,  their\r\n\r\nrespective countries, interaction between these countries\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore,  etc;  (2) visit each other's  homes  to\r\n\r\nlearn  and  appreciate each other's ways  of  living  and\r\n\r\ngrowing.   Even  better, let them stay  with  each  other\r\n\r\nduring  weekends  or  during school holidays.   Secondary\r\n\r\nschools, junior colleges and polytechnics should  conduct\r\n\r\nmulti-racial   and  multi-religious  classes   and   have\r\n\r\nspiritual and religious-based courses.  This will improve\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge  and basics of the holy  books,  like  the\r\n\r\nBible,  the  Koran,  Bhaagavad  Gita  and  Ramayana,  and\r\n\r\nteachings  of  Buddha,  Taoism and many  other  religious\r\n\r\nteachings.   They  should visit religious  and  spiritual\r\n\r\ninstitutions to educate themselves and, perhaps, also the\r\n\r\nNew Year celebrations of as many races as possible should\r\n\r\nbe  encouraged amongst the different races and religions,\r\n\r\neg,  Hari  Raya Puasa, Hari Raya Haji, Chinese New  Year,\r\n\r\nDeepavali, Christmas, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Madam, earlier I spoke\r\n\r\nabout stress, and I would now like to talk about sex.   I\r\n\r\nknow for sure sex is a three letter word.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, the Ministry introduced a new sex education\r\n\r\ncurriculum  with  the  objective  of  providing  accurate\r\n\r\nknowledge  as  well as interpersonal relationship  skills\r\n\r\nand  positive attitudes towards sexuality.   One  of  the\r\n\r\nissues   of   sex  education  is  whether  the  increased\r\n\r\nknowledge will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactually  increase  the curiosity  and  sexual  urges  of\r\n\r\nteenagers such that they begin to get involved in  sexual\r\n\r\nactivities.    The  plain  question:  are  more  of   our\r\n\r\nteenagers having sex?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we saw figures from MOH on teenage\r\n\r\nabortions  and from MCDS on teenage births.   There  were\r\n\r\nabout 1,500 teenage abortions and 850 teen births a year.\r\n\r\nThus, you have about 2,300-odd cases of teenagers getting\r\n\r\npregnant.  It, however, does not show the extent to which\r\n\r\nour  teenagers  are sexually active.  But  these  figures\r\n\r\nshow  a  slight increasing trend.  This may be  small  by\r\n\r\ninternational standards, but I am sure this is  one  area\r\n\r\nthat Singapore does not want to be number one in.  Madam,\r\n\r\nif  not checked, these young people may not realise  that\r\n\r\nthey  are jeopardising their future.  Teenage pregnancies\r\n\r\nand  births not only affect them medically, but  it  also\r\n\r\naffects  them socially and psychologically.  I have  seen\r\n\r\nmany  cases of teenagers being parents at the age of  16.\r\n\r\nThey  are still dependent on their parents who are living\r\n\r\nand now they have dependants of their own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, there is another issue that I am concerned\r\n\r\nabout.   While the current sexuality education curriculum\r\n\r\ncovers the nuts and bolts of responsible sexual behaviour\r\n\r\nand its related interpersonal relationships, I wonder  to\r\n\r\nwhat extent it addresses the legal implications of sexual\r\n\r\nactivity amongst teenagers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A social worker of mine had just recently related to\r\n\r\nme  a case of a 15-year old boy who was charged with more\r\n\r\nthan  10 counts of carnal connection.  This means he  was\r\n\r\nhaving  sex with girls whose age was between  14  and  16\r\n\r\nyears.   He  was not even aware that he was breaking  the\r\n\r\nlaw.   Some do not even know that having sex with a  girl\r\n\r\nunder  14  is  considered as statutory rape.   So,  often\r\n\r\ntimes,  the effects are tremendous for the youngsters  as\r\n\r\nthey   not  only  have  to  deal  with  pregnancies   and\r\n\r\nabortions,  the boys will have to deal with the  law.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  urge the Ministry to include  the  legal\r\n\r\naspects of sexual relationship in the sexuality education\r\n\r\ncurriculum for students in our schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister if there have\r\n\r\nbeen   any  studies  looking  at  the  profile  of  these\r\n\r\nstudents.   I know it is hard to detect them because  you\r\n\r\ncannot  identify them, but what we can  do  is  to  study\r\n\r\nthose  who have gotten pregnant and gone for abortion  or\r\n\r\nhave  given birth.  This will also be a good entry  point\r\n\r\nto study the profile of the boys who are sexually active.\r\n\r\nIf  such  a  study has not been done, I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  conduct a study for us to really  tailor  a\r\n\r\nmore targeted preventive education programme for students\r\n\r\nwho fit such a profile.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another related issue is how is sexual education\r\n\r\nactually taught in our schools today.  I am very  curious\r\n\r\nbecause  I have got young children.  I want to  know  how\r\n\r\nthey are taught.  Yes, I know there are VCD, CD-ROM and a\r\n\r\nTeacher's Resource in this regard.  But I wonder how does\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  ensure  its effectiveness.   What  is  the\r\n\r\ndesired outcome?  Is it more responsible sexual behaviour\r\n\r\nor  preventing  sexual activity amongst teenagers?   What\r\n\r\nkind of training do the teachers need to go through to be\r\n\r\nprepared to teach such a curriculum?  What proportion  of\r\n\r\nthe  curriculum time is given to sexual education?   What\r\n\r\nhas  been the feedback received from students and parents\r\n\r\nwith  regard to this programme at this time?  I urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to pay particular attention to sexual education\r\n\r\nas our teenagers are actually exposed to a lot more wider\r\n\r\nresources on the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Madam, in my MPS cases, I have\r\n\r\noften  come  across parents and students with  regard  to\r\n\r\ndisciplinary measures imposed on them by schools.  Whilst\r\n\r\nI  am  very  heartened by the positive response  of  some\r\n\r\nschools  in the treatment of disciplinary cases,  I  have\r\n\r\nalso  come  across several others where the treatment  of\r\n\r\ndisciplinary cases can be further improved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the notification by principals of schools\r\n\r\nthat  students are suspended or expelled because of their\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant behaviour may not be the solution to many of\r\n\r\nthese  problem cases.  Very often, these cases come  from\r\n\r\ndysfunctional\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfamily  where  there is a lack of parental  control,  ie,\r\n\r\nparents are lowly educated and family is poor and  cannot\r\n\r\nmake ends meet.  Some of these problem case students also\r\n\r\nhave  history of medical problems.  I have no doubt  that\r\n\r\nthe  schools would have gone through an array of measures\r\n\r\nto  counsel  and discipline and, as a last  resort,  have\r\n\r\ntaken the approach of suspension or expulsion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a case of a student who has just been\r\n\r\nsuspended and he was informed that he can only return  to\r\n\r\nschool  in  May  this year to sit for  his  examinations.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  the  purpose of suspension  in  this  instance?\r\n\r\nWithout  any  proper guidance and follow-up,  I  doubt  a\r\n\r\ndysfunctional family would be able to transform the child\r\n\r\nfrom  now till May for him to go back to school  to  take\r\n\r\nhis examinations.  Also, what would be the outcome of the\r\n\r\nexamination  results if he is going to miss  his  lessons\r\n\r\nduring this period of suspension?  I have written to  the\r\n\r\nschool  to  appeal  to  the principal  to  reinstate  the\r\n\r\nstudent  after  having counselled  the  student  and  the\r\n\r\nmother myself.  The student has agreed to improve on  his\r\n\r\nbehaviour  and indicated a strong desire to  go  back  to\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides on the desire of the school to want the\r\n\r\nstudent to go back to school, I have pointed out  to  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  that  the  student's lethargy  during  the  PE\r\n\r\nlesson  could be due to the fact that his right  hand  is\r\n\r\nslightly handicapped and he may need follow-up on medical\r\n\r\ntreatment.  My appeal was to no avail.  Very often, these\r\n\r\ncases  may not be so bad as to warrant a referral to  the\r\n\r\nSocial  Service Unit of MCDS.  Nonetheless, they need  to\r\n\r\nbe professionally managed with time and dedication given.\r\n\r\nWe  know  that it will be a drain on the school resources\r\n\r\nand  the  case  may  have a negative influence  on  other\r\n\r\nstudents.  Despite this point, we should still follow  up\r\n\r\nwith a dedicated service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose the setting up of a\r\n\r\ndedicated follow-up service for principals to refer their\r\n\r\ndifficult cases\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  attention.   This  would ensure  that  students  can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to go back to schools whilst at the  same  time\r\n\r\nbenefiting  from  the care of the follow-up  service.   I\r\n\r\nalso  urge  that measures like suspension  and  expulsion\r\n\r\nshould not be used so readily.  Is there a guideline  for\r\n\r\nschools  on  when  they  can  resort  to  measures   like\r\n\r\nexpulsion  and  suspension?  Are  these  guidelines  made\r\n\r\nknown  to parents and students?  Since a certain standard\r\n\r\nof expectation is required, it is only correct that these\r\n\r\nstandards  are made clear and known to the  students  and\r\n\r\nparents.   In  other words, is there a  due  disciplinary\r\n\r\nprocess that leads to the final decision of suspension or\r\n\r\nexpulsion?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): According to media\r\n\r\nreports, during the one-hour Question and Answer session,\r\n\r\nfollowing  the Senior Minister's address to the  students\r\n\r\nof  the three universities held at NTU, more than half of\r\n\r\nthose  who  posed questions to the Senior  Minister  were\r\n\r\nforeign  students.

If we want our young  people  to\r\n\r\nventure  into other countries while remaining emotionally\r\n\r\nattached to our country, we should also inculcate in them\r\n\r\nthe  political  and  national consciousness,  values  and\r\n\r\nloyalty  to the nation.  We should enhance our  education\r\n\r\nin  these  aspects  so that they can  identify  with  the\r\n\r\nnation and be patriotic towards it.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Madam, we all\r\n\r\nknow  the importance of an all-rounded education and  the\r\n\r\nimportance   of   physical  education  in   the   overall\r\n\r\ndevelopment of a child.  Neuroscience research has  shown\r\n\r\nthat  sports enhance cognition, increase self-esteem  and\r\n\r\nconfidence, and improve social skills.  The mental  skill\r\n\r\nin sports participation teaches a person how to reach his\r\n\r\npersonal best, regardless of skills in competition level,\r\n\r\nand that translates into real life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Mohamad Maliki has mentioned the 6-letter word\r\n\r\n\"stress\".   Sports  also  help  to  reduce  stress.   One\r\n\r\ndevelops fitness and mental toughness through sports, and\r\n\r\nlearns  about  leadership,  teamwork,  perseverance   and\r\n\r\ndedication.   As  we  are  promoting  and  developing  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  society, I think  it  is  not  too  far-fetched to say that these are attributes and qualities of\r\n\r\nan  entrepreneur that we would like to inculcate  in  our\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I understand that there are three periods of\r\n\r\nPE  from  Primary  1 to Primary 3, and two  periods  from\r\n\r\nPrimary 4 upwards.  Although each period consists  of  30\r\n\r\nminutes, after taking away time for changing into PE gear\r\n\r\nand  moving from classroom to field, probably the  actual\r\n\r\nPE  time left would be less.  We have also often heard of\r\n\r\ncomplaints from students and parents about PE being given\r\n\r\nthe lowest priority in schools.  Very often, PE is either\r\n\r\ngiven up for remedial classes or for a host of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  reasons.  One example was given in a report today,\r\n\r\nin  the 1st and 2nd March 2003 weekend edition, where  it\r\n\r\nwas  reported  that  PE  was  cancelled  as  a  form   of\r\n\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to know how do we compare to\r\n\r\nother  developed nations in terms of PE.  Do we  allocate\r\n\r\nsufficient  time  and  attention to  PE  in  schools?   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  we  should  reaffirm  the  importance  and\r\n\r\npriority of PE in schools.  Children should learn to play\r\n\r\na  wide variety of sports in PE, and perhaps fall in love\r\n\r\nwith  one  or two.  I am in sports!  And they will  enjoy\r\n\r\nand  play  for  lifelong enjoyment.  PE should  be  taken\r\n\r\nseriously  by schools.  But, at the same time, it  should\r\n\r\nbe fun for the students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related issue, I would like to ask if we have\r\n\r\nenough  qualified  PE  teachers to meet  the  demands  of\r\n\r\nschools,  and what the intake of PE students is  like  at\r\n\r\nNIE.   NIE  has  outstanding facilities and  faculty.   I\r\n\r\nwould  also like to know whether it has excess  capacity,\r\n\r\nso  that others interested in a sports career could  also\r\n\r\nlearn at NIE.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Madam, by any measure, the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education's Trim and Fit Programme (TAF) has  been  a\r\n\r\nsuccess.  It has resulted in both a reduction of  obesity\r\n\r\namong  school  children from 14% in  1992  to  below  10%\r\n\r\ntoday.  It has also increased the level of fitness of pre-enlistees  in the schools.  I have also myself  seen  how\r\n\r\nMINDEF's  very effective programme to slim down fat  pre-enlistees  before they begin their BMT  proper  has  also\r\n\r\nresulted in much weight loss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, as a paediatrician who sees children\r\n\r\nreferred  for  obesity, I keep hearing from children  who\r\n\r\nsay  that  they  do not have an outlet for exercise,  and\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  not  been  selected  for  the  school's\r\n\r\ntraining  programme.   These  children  are  often  obese\r\n\r\nbecause they do not exercise very much.  They do not  get\r\n\r\nto compete because, being fat, they cannot run as fast as\r\n\r\ntheir  friends, and so may not even get chosen to  be  on\r\n\r\nthe  team  for  games, and during recess  time  -  always\r\n\r\npasang during catching!\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo  drown their sorrows, many of these children eat more!\r\n\r\nOthers  tell  of  PE  lessons converted  into  additional\r\n\r\nlessons - as has also been brought up by other Members  - because   of   the  pressure  to  fulfill  the   academic\r\n\r\ncurriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the parents? Research tells us that 40-80% of obese children will have at least one obese\r\n\r\nparent.   It  would be nice for the parents  to  exercise\r\n\r\nwith the child.  But my long clinical experience tells me\r\n\r\notherwise.  Unfortunately, fat families tend to stay  fat\r\n\r\ntogether!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a happy situation, if we are trying to\r\n\r\nachieve   healthy  lifestyles  for  all  and  a  sporting\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I  hope  that  the  Minister  will  persuade\r\n\r\nschools  to teach children how to play sports  and  games\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  never tried.  Try  to  allow  for  more\r\n\r\nbeginners  to  take  up sports and  join  the  Beginners'\r\n\r\nLeague, and not only to focus on the star performers  who\r\n\r\ncan  bring honour to the school.  Perhaps, Parent-Teacher\r\n\r\nAssociations can also help schools by running  Beginners'\r\n\r\nLeagues, like the Little League in America, and maybe  do\r\n\r\nso  by  weight categories - small, bigger,  fattest!   Or\r\n\r\nhave  beginner, intermediate and advanced  levels  for  a\r\n\r\nvariety  of  games.   NIE can perhaps  help  by  actually\r\n\r\ntraining  and upgrading parent volunteers to run  leagues\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think schools need to support the Sporting\r\n\r\nSingapore vision by not only betting on the sure winners,\r\n\r\nbut  also  to water and fertilise the hidden and  budding\r\n\r\ntalents of all our children, thin or fat, short or  tall.\r\n\r\nLate bloomers can sometimes really do our garden proud.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another short point is that some of these children\r\n\r\nwould  have medical problems as a result of their  weight\r\n\r\nproblem.    I   hope   that  these   children   will   be\r\n\r\nappropriately channelled to the relevant medical channels\r\n\r\nfor investigation and treatment.  Our own research in  KK\r\n\r\nHospital  suggests that at least a third,  if  not  more,\r\n\r\nwould  have significant medical treatable problems.   For\r\n\r\nsome\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  them,  the  TAF club programme has not been  able  to\r\n\r\nhelp, for some reason or other.  I hope that the Minister\r\n\r\nwill  support a more targeted approach to these children,\r\n\r\nin  view  of  the  serious  health  risks  they  pose  to\r\n\r\nthemselves and potential future burden to the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang:</b> Madam, at the 44th AGM of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Schools  Sports  Council,  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation  made  special mention  of  Park  View  Primary\r\n\r\nSchool  in Pasir Ris which has a Catch Them Young  Sports\r\n\r\nProgramme for pupils from Primary 1 upwards.  Those  with\r\n\r\ngood potential in sports are identified and given special\r\n\r\ntraining  to  groom them into sports  talents.   At  each\r\n\r\nprimary  level, the sports talents are grouped  into  two\r\n\r\nspecial classes and given specialised sports training and\r\n\r\ncoaching.   They are also given enrichment  and  remedial\r\n\r\nsupport.  The school provides all other students with PE,\r\n\r\nTrim  and Fit Programme, and inter-class activities  that\r\n\r\nkeep  them active and challenged throughout the year.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to congratulate the school for its innovative\r\n\r\nway  of providing effective sports education for all  its\r\n\r\npupils and for her sports talents to develop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, at the Singapore Schools Sports Council\r\n\r\nconference  in  1999, I also urged  MOE  and  schools  to\r\n\r\nintroduce gifted sports programme, so that students  with\r\n\r\nsports  talent can be nurtured and achieve  success.   In\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  are  giving our children  with  different\r\n\r\ntalents   opportunities  to  develop  to  their   fullest\r\n\r\npotential,  not  just in academic pursuits  but  also  in\r\n\r\nother areas, eg, arts, music and sports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gifted sports classes, like the one introduced by\r\n\r\nPark  View Primary School, would give a chance  to  those\r\n\r\nwith sporting talent to be nurtured and to flourish,  and\r\n\r\nto  achieve success in life according to his or  her  own\r\n\r\nability  and inclination.  This concept of gifted classes\r\n\r\ncan be introduced at the primary and secondary levels, in\r\n\r\nNormal  and Express streams, and I hope Park View Primary\r\n\r\nSchool  will  be a shining example for other  schools  to\r\n\r\nfollow.  I also urge the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  encourage more schools to consider  similar\r\n\r\ninnovative programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Madam, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank  Members who have given us a lot of suggestions  on\r\n\r\nhow to improve the various programmes run by our schools.\r\n\r\nI  may not be able to respond to all the suggestions, but\r\n\r\nI will try.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, MOE agrees with Members on the importance of\r\n\r\nholistic development of our students.  MOE's approach  is\r\n\r\nto  give  due  importance to the total education  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents,  encompassing  both academic  and  non-academic\r\n\r\naspects, so that our students grow up to be good  persons\r\n\r\nand useful citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon and Ms Penny\r\n\r\nLow   asked  about  schools'  character  development  and\r\n\r\nNational Education programmes and wondered how we  assess\r\n\r\ntheir successes and whether schools collaborate with  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  on  these programmes.  Dr Ong  Seh  Hong  also\r\n\r\nasked  what schools do to teach current affairs,  and  Mr\r\n\r\nLoh  Meng  See  proposed that MOE should  strengthen  our\r\n\r\nvalues education.  Our curriculum instils in our students\r\n\r\nsound values, builds their character and equips them with\r\n\r\nknowledge of National Education and current affairs.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  students learn about key historical  facts  and\r\n\r\nlocal  current affairs through their Social  Studies  and\r\n\r\nGeneral  Paper  lessons.  They are also  taught  to  make\r\n\r\ndecisions  based on moral principles in their civics  and\r\n\r\nmoral  education lessons.  Through Learning  Journeys  to\r\n\r\nplaces  like PSA, JTC and Parliament House, which include\r\n\r\nobserving  parliamentary sessions from the gallery,  they\r\n\r\nlearn the critical issues and challenges facing Singapore\r\n\r\nand what makes Singapore tick.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we believe that it is not enough to just teach\r\n\r\nstudents  these values in classroom lessons or take  part\r\n\r\nin Learning Journeys.  We must also provide opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  students to practise these values to learn  what  it\r\n\r\nmeans to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave integrity, loyalty and understand why discipline and\r\n\r\nperseverance are important for success, and allow them to\r\n\r\nexperience the joy of giving to the community.   That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  MOE  introduced the Co-curricular  Activities  (CCA)\r\n\r\nProgramme  Framework  in  2001, comprising  CCA  and  the\r\n\r\nCharacter  Development  Programme  (CDP),  of  which  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Involvement Programme (CIP) is one component.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Character Development Programme comprises a\r\n\r\nrange  of enrichment activities organised into the  three\r\n\r\ndomains  of  enterprise, citizenship,  and  personal  and\r\n\r\nsocial development.  There are specific activities  under\r\n\r\neach  domain.  For example, schools organise  creativity,\r\n\r\ninnovation and problem-solving workshops for students  to\r\n\r\nnurture enterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the values we nurture in our students is\r\n\r\nservice  to the community.  This is achieved through  the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Involvement  Programme  (CIP).   For  example,\r\n\r\nstudents from Nanyang Girls High have adopted Block  151,\r\n\r\nMei  Ling Street in Queenstown, to serve the elderly  who\r\n\r\nattend  activities  organised by  the  Lion  Befrienders.\r\n\r\nStudents  are  scheduled to visit and interact  with  the\r\n\r\nelderly  in  two-hourly sessions and  learn  the  art  of\r\n\r\nflower-making  from the senior citizens.   These  flowers\r\n\r\nare  later  sold by the students to raise funds  for  the\r\n\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we assess the effectiveness of the CDP and\r\n\r\nNational  Education?   Values, such as  perseverance  and\r\n\r\nloyalty,   are  intangible  and  difficult   to   measure\r\n\r\nquantitatively.   Nevertheless, we have  developed  proxy\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  review  our National Education  programmes,\r\n\r\nactivities  and  CDP, and assess if they  are  effective.\r\n\r\nOne  of  these  is  the CIP survey.  Based  on  the  2002\r\n\r\nsurvey, 91% of all our schools had at least 90% of  their\r\n\r\nstudents completing six hours of CIP participation.  This\r\n\r\nis  an  indirect  measure of our students'  readiness  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the community in a small way.  In  the  new\r\n\r\nJC curriculum to be introduced in 2006, JC students would\r\n\r\nneed  to  meet  minimum  requirements  in  CCA  and   CDP\r\n\r\nparticipation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong and Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon also asked\r\n\r\nwhether  our  teachers are trained  to  deliver  National\r\n\r\nEducation and character development programmes, while  Ms\r\n\r\nBraema  Mathiaparanam asked if teachers  are  trained  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  racial discriminatory attitudes.  The  answer\r\n\r\nis,  yes,  through formal and informal  settings.   NIE's\r\n\r\nNational  Education  training and  character  development\r\n\r\nprogrammes   prepare  teachers  for   practice   in   the\r\n\r\nprofession.   To  create awareness of National  Education\r\n\r\namong  trainee  teachers, NIE infuses National  Education\r\n\r\nissues into the respective course modules.  It also holds\r\n\r\na three-day National Education seminar annually, which is\r\n\r\nattended   by  all  trainee  teachers.   Furthermore,   a\r\n\r\ncompulsory  Singapore Studies module will  be  introduced\r\n\r\nfor teachers in the NIE degree programme in July 2003.\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training in character development is delivered\r\n\r\nthrough  formal  lessons in core  and  elective  modules,\r\n\r\nwhere  the values of care, integrity and being good  role\r\n\r\nmodels  are  emphasised.  Through these various  training\r\n\r\nschemes,  our  young  teachers are exposed  to  different\r\n\r\nmodes of conducting lessons in character development  and\r\n\r\nNational  Education.   Incumbent  teachers  too  are  not\r\n\r\nneglected.  They  receive  in-service  training   through\r\n\r\nworkshops, seminars, sharing sessions and talks to  equip\r\n\r\nthem  with the attitude, skills and knowledge to  conduct\r\n\r\ncharacter development and National Education lessons  and\r\n\r\nactivities.  In addition, our teachers are sensitized  to\r\n\r\nracial   issues  in  schools,  through   talks   by   the\r\n\r\nprincipals,  National  Education  seminars  and   sharing\r\n\r\nsessions.   In  school context, they are called  \"contact\r\n\r\ntimes\".   At  regular  school staff  meetings,  education\r\n\r\nofficers  also  have the opportunity to  discuss  how  to\r\n\r\nmanage  difficulties  that  might  arise  in  their  work\r\n\r\nenvironment, including discriminatory attitude should  it\r\n\r\noccur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, on racial integration, Dr Wang Kai Yuen and\r\n\r\nMr Chandra Mohan asked how we could better promote racial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintegration  in  schools  by inculcating   tolerance  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of each other's culture and  habits.   Our\r\n\r\nnational  schools play an important role in teaching  our\r\n\r\nstudents  the  importance of racial  harmony  and  social\r\n\r\ncohesion.  They have continued to organise multi-cultural\r\n\r\ncelebrations  of  ethnic  festivals,  set   up   National\r\n\r\nEducation or Heritage Corners, and work with parents  and\r\n\r\nthe  Community  Development Councils  to  broaden  inter-racial  mixing  through  the  home-stay  and  home  visit\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the curriculum, classroom activities and\r\n\r\nCCAs,  our  students  have  the opportunities  to  learn,\r\n\r\nunderstand and appreciate the cultures and traditions  of\r\n\r\ntheir  friends.   I  would say that  the  foundation  for\r\n\r\nracial integration and harmony is laid very early in  our\r\n\r\nschools. The Committee on Strengthening Racial Harmony in\r\n\r\nSchools   introduced  a  framework  for  broadening   and\r\n\r\ndeepening  racial harmony in schools last  year.  Earlier\r\n\r\nthis year, a racial harmony website was launched to share\r\n\r\nbest practices in promoting racial harmony in schools  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  to  engage students to discuss  and  understand\r\n\r\nracial   harmony  issues  better.   The  Committee   also\r\n\r\nrecommended  the introduction of a set of racial  harmony\r\n\r\nindicators to be included in the school excellence  model\r\n\r\n(SEM), a self-appraisal tool for all schools.  The racial\r\n\r\nharmony indicators are designed to assist schools in  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  evaluation of their own  racial  harmony\r\n\r\nprogrammes within the framework of the SEM.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See spoke about the importance of giving\r\n\r\nour   students   earlier   exposure   to   cross-cultural\r\n\r\nenvironment.    Madam,  our  racial  harmony   activities\r\n\r\nprovide  that exposure to our students. On top  of  that,\r\n\r\nour  schools  also organise International Friendship  Day\r\n\r\nannually  and  some even work with foreign schools  based\r\n\r\nhere  in  Singapore in exchange programmes, so  that  our\r\n\r\nstudents  and  their  students  can  mingle  confidently,\r\n\r\nincluding during their home-stay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, having said all these, I would like to\r\n\r\nstress that the child's experiences in school form only a\r\n\r\npart of his education.  The family, the community and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsociety  play  no  less a critical role  in  shaping  the\r\n\r\nvalues of our young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, on the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools,\r\n\r\nMr  Chandra Mohan and Mr Inderjit Singh asked  how  these\r\n\r\nschools   promote   racial  harmony,  considering   their\r\n\r\nexclusive nature.  I wish to assure Members that our  SAP\r\n\r\nschools  are aware of their responsibility for  educating\r\n\r\nstudents  who  are steeped in our national  values  in  a\r\n\r\nmulti-cultural and multi-racial Singapore.  They  promote\r\n\r\nracial  harmony and social cohesion as actively as  other\r\n\r\nschools through the CIP, CDP, inter-school, cluster-based\r\n\r\nand   community-based  activities.   Mindful  that  their\r\n\r\nschool environment has limitations, they work with  other\r\n\r\nschools  to  create opportunities for their  students  to\r\n\r\ninteract with students of other races from other schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is River Valley High where students\r\n\r\ncelebrated   the  International  Friendship  and   Racial\r\n\r\nHarmony  Day  with students from other schools  in  their\r\n\r\ncluster.  Another  example is  Chung  Cheng  High  School\r\n\r\n(Main),  which has an exchange programme with Springfield\r\n\r\nSecondary,   a   school   in  Tampines,   that   provides\r\n\r\nopportunities  for Chung Cheng students to interact  with\r\n\r\nstudents of other races.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAP schools were set up to preserve the best of\r\n\r\nthe  values  and  traditions found in the former  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools.  These  traditions and  values  have  created  a\r\n\r\nricher  environment  and played  a  significant  part  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's development.  Our SAP schools understand that\r\n\r\nthey  are  an integral part of Singapore and  accept  the\r\n\r\nmulti-racial nature of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan also suggested the setting up of\r\n\r\nSAP schools for Malays and Indians.  We must bear in mind\r\n\r\nthat  the  circumstances of each community are  different\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  may  require  different  approaches  to\r\n\r\npreserve  their  traditions.  MOE set up two  committees,\r\n\r\ninvolving  representatives  from  the  Indian  and  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunities, to review the teaching and learning  of  the\r\n\r\nTamil and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalay  languages  in  1998 and  1999  respectively.   The\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the review to strengthen the  teaching\r\n\r\nof Malay and Tamil languages were announced in year 2000.\r\n\r\nThese  included, among other things, the introduction  of\r\n\r\nan  Enrichment Programme in Malay Language for  Secondary\r\n\r\nSchools,  (in  short, EMAS), Language Elective  Programme\r\n\r\n(Malay Language) in Tampines JC and the upgrading of  the\r\n\r\nUmar  Pulavar  Tamil Language Centre to a national  Tamil\r\n\r\nLanguage  Centre.   It is heartening  to  note  that  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  MLEP and EMAS students,  both  at  the\r\n\r\nTampines  JC  and  Bukit  Panjang Government  High,  have\r\n\r\nperformed  well in the 'A' and 'O' level examinations  in\r\n\r\nHigher Malay Language examinations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the specific issues raised by\r\n\r\nMembers.  First, sexuality education.  Dr Maliki referred\r\n\r\nto  sex education, but we do not teach sex education  per\r\n\r\nse.  What we do is to introduce sexuality education.   Dr\r\n\r\nMaliki  asked  about the effectiveness of  our  sexuality\r\n\r\neducation,  and how the programme is being received.  The\r\n\r\naim  of sexuality education is to equip students with the\r\n\r\nknowledge  and  skills to make responsible  decisions  on\r\n\r\nsexuality  matters,  based on values  in  line  with  the\r\n\r\nnational  value  of  the family  as  the  basic  unit  of\r\n\r\nsociety.   Sexuality education is implemented in  schools\r\n\r\nthrough  a cross-curricular approach in subjects such  as\r\n\r\nHealth   Education,  Science,  and   Civics   and   Moral\r\n\r\nEducation.   It  is also carried out as  a  co-curricular\r\n\r\nprogramme based on the Growing Years series.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Dr Maliki's information, six to eight hours of\r\n\r\nsexuality  education  is  taught  every  year.    It   is\r\n\r\nconducted  outside  curriculum  hours  as  an  enrichment\r\n\r\nprogramme.    Teachers  are  also  trained   by   medical\r\n\r\npractitioners, the police (in the case of legal  matters,\r\n\r\nthe legal aspect of sexuality issues), social workers  as\r\n\r\nwell as by psychologists.  Pupils have responded well  to\r\n\r\nthe  programme, showing a significant increase  in  their\r\n\r\nknowledge and understanding of sexuality matters.  It is,\r\n\r\nhowever,  too early to assess the impact of the programme\r\n\r\non pupil's sexual\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvalues and attitudes, bearing in mind that the influences\r\n\r\non them are so varied and very strong from many different\r\n\r\nsources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki also asked why teenage pregnancy has\r\n\r\nincreased.  The causes for teenage pregnancy  are  multi-faceted.   They  include  a lack of  family  support  and\r\n\r\ncohesiveness,  history of sexual abuse  and  low  esteem.\r\n\r\nSchools alone cannot address all these issues and causes.\r\n\r\nWhat we can do, through sexuality education for students,\r\n\r\nis  to  inculcate the right values, raise their awareness\r\n\r\nof  the options and the consequences, and equip them with\r\n\r\nthe  skills  to make informed decisions.  The family  and\r\n\r\nthe  community must also play their part to  support  the\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On school discipline, Mdm Ho Geok Choo said that\r\n\r\nprincipals  should  temper  discipline  with   a   heart.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we agree with Mdm Ho.  Our schools have a  multi-tier  discipline system, complemented by a pastoral  care\r\n\r\nand  guidance  programme. When a  pupil  shows  signs  of\r\n\r\nmisconduct, he will be counselled first by teachers  and,\r\n\r\nif  necessary, by a professional MOE counsellor.  Schools\r\n\r\nalso  work  closely with parents to help the child.   For\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant  pupils,  schools  will  turn  to   external\r\n\r\nagencies  like  the  MCDS,  the  Juvenile  Court,  Family\r\n\r\nService Centres and self-help groups to help such pupils.\r\n\r\nDisciplinary actions, like expulsion and suspension,  are\r\n\r\nonly meted out as a last resort.  Even then, schools will\r\n\r\nre-admit  these  pupils if they change their  undesirable\r\n\r\nbehaviour  and commit to improve their conduct. Similarly\r\n\r\nhere,  schools  cannot  work  alone.   It  requires   the\r\n\r\ncooperation  of  parents  and  the  community,  and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to work with them to help these children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, on physical education, Mr Ng Ser Miang said\r\n\r\nthat  physical education (PE) should be serious, yet fun,\r\n\r\nand  teach  sports  and games.  He  wondered  if  we  had\r\n\r\nsufficient time for PE compared to other countries.   Our\r\n\r\nPE  programmes do teach students to play different sports\r\n\r\nand games, and it is fun-filled and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyet  achieving  its  objectives of  developing  students'\r\n\r\nmotor and games skills.  Students also learn to keep  fit\r\n\r\nand  appreciate  teamwork, fair  play  and  sportsmanship\r\n\r\nthrough  PE.  Madam, we compare well with other developed\r\n\r\ncountries,  like the USA, in the time allocated  for  PE.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  for Primary One to Primary Four,  we  have\r\n\r\nbetween  90-120 minutes of PE per week, compared  to  100\r\n\r\nminutes  for  the USA.  I wish to assure  Mr  Ng  and  Dr\r\n\r\nWarren  Lee  that MOE does not encourage the  use  of  PE\r\n\r\nperiods  for remedial lessons.  All remedial lessons  are\r\n\r\nsupposed to take place outside curriculum hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng also asked if we have a sufficient number of\r\n\r\nPE teachers and whether NIE opens its PE programme to fee-paying  students who are interested in a  career  in  the\r\n\r\nsports   industry.   We  have  sufficient  qualified   PE\r\n\r\nteachers  to meet our demands and we are able to  recruit\r\n\r\nsufficient number of PE trainees every year.  As NIE's PE\r\n\r\ntraining programme prepares our teachers to teach  PE  in\r\n\r\nour  schools,  it  is  not suitable for  someone  who  is\r\n\r\nlooking for training in preparation for a career  in  the\r\n\r\nsports industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Trim and Fit Programme, I am very pleased to\r\n\r\nnote  that  none other than Dr Warren Lee has brought  up\r\n\r\nthe  issue of the importance of trim and fit.  I say this\r\n\r\nbecause he is a paediatrician.  I would like to thank  Dr\r\n\r\nWarren  Lee  for calling the Trim and Fit  Programme  (or\r\n\r\nTAF)  a  success and wish to assure Mr Ng Ser Miang  that\r\n\r\nall  TAF  activities  are  conducted  outside  curriculum\r\n\r\nhours.   Dr Lee also asked our schools to encourage  mass\r\n\r\nparticipation in sports, including obese students to play\r\n\r\nsports  and games.  We agree fully with Dr Lee.  In  line\r\n\r\nwith  our  national policy of Sports for All,  there  are\r\n\r\nmany avenues for our students, including obese pupils, to\r\n\r\nparticipate in sports today. They range from PE  lessons,\r\n\r\nrecreational CCAs, to games and competitions  at  various\r\n\r\nlevels  -  the school level, cluster level, and at  class\r\n\r\nlevel too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1999, schools have been encouraged to adopt\r\n\r\nthe  house system for their CCAs to further promote  mass\r\n\r\nparticipation in sports. Some schools have even\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade  special  efforts to entice overweight  students  to\r\n\r\nexercise by introducing roller-blading, boxercise,  games\r\n\r\nand  ethnic  dances,  to  make  exercising  fun.   Others\r\n\r\nconduct  their TAF activities in the form of a CCA,  such\r\n\r\nas  the  Health and Fitness Club or the Fun  and  Fitness\r\n\r\nClub.   Some  schools  also conduct seminars,  talks  and\r\n\r\nsharing  sessions  on wellness to educate  and  encourage\r\n\r\nparents  to  support and promote a healthy lifestyle  for\r\n\r\nthem  and  their children.  I am very glad to  report  to\r\n\r\nMembers that parents, through the parents support groups,\r\n\r\ndo  help our teachers to conduct these activities for the\r\n\r\nobese pupils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to overcome the manpower and physical\r\n\r\nresources  limitations, some schools are tapping  on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Sports  Council's Learn to Play  Sports  Basic\r\n\r\nProgramme  to increase sports opportunities for students.\r\n\r\nThis  year,  a total of 75 primary and secondary  schools\r\n\r\njoined  the  programme.  As suggested  by  Dr  Lee,  some\r\n\r\nschools  do tap on their parent-teacher associations  for\r\n\r\nsupport.   For example, St. Michael's Primary School  has\r\n\r\nthe beginners' soccer programme\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknown  as  Twinkle Toes, which is open to all  interested\r\n\r\npupils and run by two PTA members of the school.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
