They are issues which have already been discussed over  and  over\r\n\r\nagain at considerable length, and no doubt Members of the Opposition would want\r\n\r\nsome considerable time to restate all their propositions in as interesting a way\r\n\r\nas  I hope they can. Mr Speaker, Sir, it gives us roughly 24 hours of debating\r\n\r\ntime,  the  House sitting from 2.30 p.m. to 12 midnight on Monday,  Tuesday  and\r\n\r\nWednesday. However, if the Third Reading of the Referendum Bill finishes earlier\r\n\r\ntoday - as I think it would be earlier than 12 midnight - then no doubt the debating\r\n\r\ntime  will  be suitably extended by the rapidity with which conclusions  on  the\r\n\r\nThird Reading are brought to a close.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, you will remember that when\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy Prime Minister moved his closure motion with reference to the stages\r\n\r\nof the Referendum Bill, I urge that it was unnecessary.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I do urge with respect, Mr\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nSpeaker, and this might assist the Government - they are conscious that by  virtue\r\n\r\nof  their prerogative, and I am not complaining of their prerogative, the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has introduced a motion which completely blankets out mine, which  is\r\n\r\nitem 11 - the one that I put in with the Member for Queenstown - except for the part\r\n\r\nthereof  which speaks of naming the polling day as four weeks from the  date  of\r\n\r\nthe  Order. Now, Mr Speaker, the issue of four weeks from the date of the Order\r\n\r\nhas been fully discussed in this Assembly - it is true on the basis that, the Bill\r\n\r\nwas  a general referendum Bill at the time - but we all recognise that there would\r\n\r\nbe  no useful purpose served by rediscussing that issue and, I repeat, I for one\r\n\r\nam  not  here to filibuster, Mr Speaker, and since the other part of the motion\r\n\r\nis  covered  by  the Prime Minister, it is my intention not to move  the  motion\r\n\r\nappearing  as  item  No.  11  of  the  Order Paper,  since  the  Government  has\r\n\r\nanticipated it in the Prime Minister's motion.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the light of that statement, perhaps the Government will agree with me\r\n\r\nthat  it  is highly improbable that we would exceed the time limit indicated  of\r\n\r\nthe  11th  July  and they may well wish to consider postponing consideration  of\r\n\r\nthis  motion,  let  us say, till Tuesday the 10th and if they  are  prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept  it, I will be happy, Sir, to move under Standing Order, that this motion\r\n\r\ndo  stand  adjourned to the 10th of July. I am sure that they are no more  happy\r\n\r\nthan  I  am, Sir, to apply guillotine motions which are unnecessary,  and  I  do\r\n\r\nsuggest that this one is unnecessary, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, the Government have always said that they want to allow  full\r\n\r\ndiscussion,  and here again they want to limit our discussions  to  only  a  few\r\n\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Point of order, Sir.

It is a monster which will be  born  alive\r\n\r\nbecause  of the somersault of the S.P.A., but a monster which even the dishonest\r\n\r\nand  dictatorial  P.A.P. themselves, the parents of this  monster,  cannot  keep\r\n\r\nalive  for  very  long.

He\r\n\r\nmust now accept the position that this Assembly has accepted those clauses.  The\r\n\r\nposition  now  is that there is a motion to decline to give this  Bill  a  Third\r\n\r\nReading.  And  the  reason for that is that in the view of  some  Members  those\r\n\r\nclauses are inappropriate or inadequate for the specific purpose which has  been\r\n\r\ndeclared,  and  that  is for the purpose of holding a referendum.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nposition. We have finished with the Second Reading debate. We have finished with\r\n\r\nthe  Committee  stage; we are now on the Third Reading, and the, debate  on  the\r\n\r\nThird  Reading  must be confined to the contents of the Bill as they  are  there\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I realise, Sir, that it is not permissible, if we go\r\n\r\naccording  to the usual rules of debate, to harp back on things we  have  spoken\r\n\r\nbefore.

Now, as I say,  we  are  in  the\r\n\r\nposition where the Bill has gone through Committee and has come up for  a  Third\r\n\r\nReading. All that Members can do now is to refer to the contents of the Bill and\r\n\r\nsay this clause, that clause, is inappropriate or inadequate, and cannot be used\r\n\r\nproperly  for the purpose which has been declared, that is, for the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nholding  a  referendum. If there are opinions which the  Member  would  like  to\r\n\r\nexpress as to why they are inappropriate or inadequate, then, of course,  he  is\r\n\r\nentitled to give those opinions.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will come to that by and by, Sir.

It is, to\r\n\r\nuse  the  words of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister,  so\r\n\r\ndirty and unprecedented that the Bill, after it has become law and has done  its\r\n\r\ndirty  deed, will have to be repealed immediately. From this alone, Sir, we  can\r\n\r\nsee  the  dishonesty  and Fascist nature of the Bill. It is  like  a  traitorous\r\n\r\nmurderer,  after  the  shameful  and traitorous  deed  has  been  done,  wanting\r\n\r\nhurriedly to get rid of all evidence, of that instrument, that has been used for\r\n\r\nthe  treacherous and shameful deed. It is like the P.A.P., after they have  plunged  a  knife into the hearts of the people of Singapore, wanting to get rid  of\r\n\r\nthis  knife  as soon as possible. But let us ask them, where can this  evidence,\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  or this law, or this knife, where can this evidence be  hidden?  The\r\n\r\nknife, Sir, can be buried in the bowels of the earth or thrown into the deep sea\r\n\r\nand  may not be found again. But this Bill, Sir, this referendum law as it  will\r\n\r\nbe,  will  forever be recorded in the annals of history as the foulest  and  the\r\n\r\nmost shameful act of treachery of the P.A.P. leadership and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nall  those  who condone and connive at such treachery. Sir, we have  spent  many\r\n\r\ndays of debate on this Bill. There were five days of it in Select Committee and\r\n\r\nanother  seven  days in the Legislative Assembly on the Second  Reading  and  on\r\n\r\nrecommittal.  No  Bill in the history of Singapore has been so controversial  or\r\n\r\nhas  been  the object of so much adverse criticism. Why? Because it  is  a  most\r\n\r\nundemocratic, unfair, unjust and most dishonest Bill. The Member for  Anson  has\r\n\r\ngiven  many  examples  of  the  dishonesty of the P.A.P.  The  P.A.P.  Ministers\r\n\r\nthemselves  know  this,  and  they know they cannot justify  their  undemocratic\r\n\r\nprinciples  embodied in the various undemocratic clauses of the Bill.  So,  time\r\n\r\nand time again in Select Committee, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Ministers had to defend themselves with evasive and irrelevant arguments.\r\n\r\nWhenever  the Ministers were cornered, whenever they could find no more excuses,\r\n\r\nthey sought refuge in their stock-in-trade answer, \"This is a general Referendum\r\n\r\nBill.\"  They  talk of toddy shops, they talk of tobacco smoking,  pipe  smoking,\r\n\r\ncigarette  smoking,  and they keep on repeating, \"This is a  general  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill.  This  is a general Referendum Bill.\" Altogether I have counted  about  30\r\n\r\ntimes  their saying this in Select Committee. Even in this Assembly, the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister tried to pull the same stunt again. He said, \"This is a  general\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill.\" The only unfortunate part was that he did not know that we had\r\n\r\nreferred to all this before. He was out of the Assembly Chamber and he  came  in\r\n\r\nstuttering  those  same  silly excuses. Yet all along in  their  arguments,  and\r\n\r\nespecially  when  we were discussing clause 5 of the Bill, they  indicated  that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  was  meant  for merger. They said we had had enough  discussion  and\r\n\r\ncanvassing on the merger issue as we had house-to-house canvassing, rallies  and\r\n\r\ndiscussion groups long, long before. Therefore, they considered there was enough\r\n\r\ntime  for  canvassing. But when the arguments suited them, they came out  openly\r\n\r\nadmitting  that  this  Bill is specifically a Referendum Bill  for  merger.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance especially came out blatantly and said, \"Let us come  down\r\n\r\nto brass tacks. This Bill will be for merger.\" Similarly. I had occasion\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nto  quote, during the Second Reading, the Minister for Home Affairs and  the  Deputy Prime Minister all saying that the present Referendum Bill is for merger. I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Member for Anson referred to the Government amending his  motion  in\r\n\r\nApril and the wording of the amendment specifically said that this Bill is meant\r\n\r\nfor merger. Altogether, Sir, both in Select Committee and in the examples I have\r\n\r\nquoted, they have said 20 times that this is a Bill for merger. So if you cancel\r\n\r\nthe  two  figures out, 30 against 20, it sounds as if it ultimately should  turn\r\n\r\nout  to be a general Referendum Bill - 30 times general Referendum Bill, 20  times\r\n\r\nspecific  Bill. But now we have the final admission from the Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  that this Bill is going to be for merger. They are going to  scrap  the\r\n\r\nBill,  scrap the law immediately after the dirty work has been done.  They  are\r\n\r\ntoo  ashamed  to keep it after merger any more. This shows the utter dishonesty\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. and the twists and turns of the P.A.P. Ministers.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson gave a series of detailed quotations. I do not think it\r\n\r\nis  necessary  for me to bore you with those very same quotations again.  But  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  bring the House back to the time when the Select  Committee  requested  views  from  the public. If you remember, Sir, advertisements  were  in\r\n\r\nserted  in  the  newspapers  and all views and memoranda  were  supposed  to  be\r\n\r\nsubmitted  by the 6th April. There were altogether 12 meetings, daily from  2.30\r\n\r\nto  7.30  p.m., sometimes 8 o'clock, and much time and energy was spent  in  the\r\n\r\ntaking of oral evidence. Much play was made of the credentials of those who made\r\n\r\nrepresentations.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is completely irrelevant. The Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nmust  know that that is irrelevant to the Third Reading. I take it he is  coming\r\n\r\nto  the  point where these people were met with the suggestion that this  was  a\r\n\r\ngeneral Referendum Bill. If that is so, all he need say is that that was so, and\r\n\r\npass on to the next topic.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, what I would like to point out is that the\r\n\r\nMinisters had all the time been saying that it was a general Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nThey  had no intention of listening to all the evidence that was brought  before\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee, because in many of the observations and evidence given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Select  Committee, merger was the subject topmost in their  minds.  And  \r\n\r\ninspite  of  all the evidence and points of argument put forward in the  memoranda\r\n\r\nfrom  the  various  organisations  and unions,  it  really  did  not  make  much\r\n\r\ndifference with the P.A.P. Because, Sir, at that time they already had  in  mind\r\n\r\ntheir plot to pose two unacceptable questions.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know what point the hon. Member is making. If the\r\n\r\npoint  is that these representors were met with the suggestion that this  was  a\r\n\r\ngeneral Referendum Bill, then the point is in order. But if he goes beyond that,\r\n\r\nhe will be out of order. We are on the Third Reading.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I was just trying to point out that while we were\r\n\r\ndeliberating  and while the Ministers were trying to prove to us how  impossible\r\n\r\nit was to pose one question in clause 5, we thought that by getting the evidence\r\n\r\nand the arguments from the various bodies, possibly we might be able to convince\r\n\r\nthe  Government to posing only one question. However the Prime Minister at  that\r\n\r\ntime had already told the world that it was going to be a referendum on two questions - on the mode and manner of merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in trying to criticise why this Bill should not have its Third Reading,\r\n\r\nwe must try and look into the motivation behind the Bill. Only then, Sir, can we\r\n\r\nunderstand why certain clauses are not put in, why certain amendments  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen accepted.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, is completely out of order. The amendments\r\n\r\nwhich  were  not  accepted cannot now be debated. We are now debating  only  the\r\n\r\ncontents  of  the  Bill,  and the Member must show how those  contents  are  not\r\n\r\nsuitable for a referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> My point is this, Sir: the Prime Minister had all the time\r\n\r\nbeen  saying  that  the purpose of the Bill is to ascertain  the  views  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the people of Singapore. If this was\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntruly  and honestly carried out, no one would be able to quarrel with the P.A.P.\r\n\r\non  that.  But  that  is  not their true intention. The Bill  is  not  meant  to\r\n\r\nascertain  the views of the people truly, honestly and correctly.  The  Bill  is\r\n\r\nmeant to distort and manufacture views.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): For a factory.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the most revealing words of the Prime Minister about\r\n\r\nthis Bill are that this Bill must be made to serve what it is intended to serve.\r\n\r\nThose  were  his  words, Sir - \"it must be made to serve what it  is  intended  to\r\n\r\nserve.\" You link these few words of his with his words of \"no risk\" and \"happier\r\n\r\nposition\" in the Second Reading and on many other occasions afterwards, we  will\r\n\r\nunderstand  what  this Bill is intended to serve. This Bill is not  intended  to\r\n\r\nascertain honestly the views of the majority of the people of Singapore.  It  is\r\n\r\nintended to confuse the people, to deceive them, and to ensure that although the\r\n\r\npeople  do not support the P.A.P., nevertheless they have to support the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  purpose that this Bill is intended to serve.  I  wish  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister would give his own explanation on this, because all this fits  in  very\r\n\r\nwell with why certain clauses are phrased and worded the way they are.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had all the time known of this plot, Sir, and it was not difficult for us\r\n\r\nto  pinpoint  the  various  clauses that fit into this  plot.  There  is  enough\r\n\r\nobjective  evidence in the Bill itself and in the various clauses,  and  I  have\r\n\r\nalready  indicated  where those clauses fit in. But if you  remember.  Sir,  our\r\n\r\ndifficulty was to get the P.A.P. themselves to admit this plot. You may remember\r\n\r\nmy  difficulty  in Select Committee when I tried to indicate to  the  House  the\r\n\r\nthinking  and the machinations of the Government. And every time I was  thwarted\r\n\r\nbecause  you  said it was a general Referendum Bill. Of course, you  were  quite\r\n\r\ncorrect,  Sir;  you had indications from the Government Ministers  that  it  was\r\n\r\ngoing to be a general Referendum Bill, and so it was supposed to be.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But the earlier examples they gave were all on the  sale\r\n\r\nof  liquor  and  on the hour at which bars are supposed to be closed.  The  only\r\n\r\ndecent precedent the Ministers brought forward was Newfoundland. But\r\n\r\nin  every case, in all those examples, which the Ministers quoted, the voter  is\r\n\r\nallowed  to say no.

I explained in great  detail,  as\r\n\r\ndid  some of the memoranda that were submitted to the Select Committee, that the\r\n\r\ncorrect  translation of this Referendum Bill is not in Mandarin, \"Chuen min  tow\r\n\r\npiou\" but \"Chuen min fu chyueh.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is your translation.

This is\r\n\r\ndone,  Sir, in every country - in fact, in the whole world. And yet what happened?\r\n\r\nSilly  excuses were given and again they used the same old phrase,  \"This  is  a\r\n\r\ngeneral Referendum Bill.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, Sir, when we were discussing this ballot paper clause - clause 18\r\n\r\n- you  suggested that it would be best that I discuss it at this juncture. I will\r\n\r\nnow  put  the  case  before the Prime Minister that in every country,  in  every\r\n\r\nhonest democratic Government, they always have a form of the ballot paper to  be\r\n\r\nused in a general election or in a referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I be of some guidance to the hon. Member? That is an\r\n\r\nargument  for or against the ballot paper. His line now would be that  the  Bill\r\n\r\nitself has not got the form of the ballot paper, and therefore, for that reason,\r\n\r\nit is inappropriate or inadequate for a referendum in connection with merger. He\r\n\r\nis  now  advancing an argument which was advanced in Committee. The position  we\r\n\r\nare  faced  with now is that there is no form of a ballot paper and  the  Member\r\n\r\nthen  argues  that because there is no form of a ballot paper the  Bill  is  not\r\n\r\nquite complete for this specific purpose.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> May I briefly mention, Sir, that in the Australian referendum, in New Zealand, the Compulsory Military Training Poll Referendum, in\r\n\r\nthe  Jamaica  Referendum, and in fact, in any instance that we can quote,  there\r\n\r\nare  always  specific Forms of the ballot papers for the voters. If  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwere  really honest, they would also provide for the form to be included  in  a\r\n\r\nSchedule in the Bill. But, of course, when talking of this, one\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmust  remember  that it was the original intention of the P.A.P.  Government  to\r\n\r\nspring  a  snap  referendum on the people so that no  one  would  know  how  the\r\n\r\nquestions would be posed, whether it would be one question or two questions, and\r\n\r\nthe voter would be confused as to how voting would take place.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one more reason, as far as the P.A.P. are concerned, is that they wanted to\r\n\r\nprevent the Opposition political Parties from even knowing what to expect and so\r\n\r\nfrom telling the people how to vote. Now that the Government have indicated what\r\n\r\nquestions  they  want to pose, I suppose it should be a simple  matter  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to have, the Form of the ballot paper in a Schedule in the Bill.  But\r\n\r\nI  suppose their decision to let people know the questions came a bit  too  late\r\n\r\nand  they have stuck to their original intention of not letting the people  know\r\n\r\nwhat the ballot paper should look like. In any honest government the first thing\r\n\r\nthat will have to be done is to show a sample of the ballot paper to the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember, Sir, that this referendum will be the first referendum we\r\n\r\nhave  in Singapore, and probably the last, and the people have the right to know\r\n\r\nwhat  to expect. Without this ballot paper, the people may not know in what form\r\n\r\nthe  questions will be posed, and not know how to indicate their vote,  even  if\r\n\r\nthey  should  decide  to  vote  for those unacceptable  alternatives  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will pose to the people. For this reason, I would say this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nnot appropriate and should not have a Third Reading.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my more important reasons are in clauses 27, 29 and 30. These are the\r\n\r\nnotorious  clauses of the P.A.P. and they stand as concrete evidence  of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndictatorship and P.A.P. dishonesty. They also stand as concrete evidence of  the\r\n\r\ndepths  to  which  human  nature can sink in futile attempts  to  salvage  their\r\n\r\nsinking  personal  fortunes.  Clause 29, Sir,  according  to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance,  is not based on any constitutional or legal principle, but the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  think  they  should  introduce  such  illegal  and  unconstitutional\r\n\r\nprinciples. They want to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nlegalise such unconstitutional principles to help them in their devilish plot to\r\n\r\nsell out the rights of the people of Singapore. This clause has caused a raising\r\n\r\nof  eyebrows in polite and diplomatic circles. But it has caused absolute horror\r\n\r\nto  the  vast  majority of the people of Singapore, so much so  that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  cannot even explain how they really want to use those  blank  clauses.\r\n\r\nThis clause, Sir, of course, ties up with clause 5, in that clause 5 allows  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  pose  two unacceptable questions to the  people;  and  when  two\r\n\r\nunacceptable questions are posed to the people and when they do not know how  to\r\n\r\nanswer those questions, the P.A.P. hope, under those circumstances, to reap  the\r\n\r\nharvest of their plot. This is the most undemocratic clause that has come to the\r\n\r\nnotice  not only of Singapore but of the whole world. The Member for  Anson  has\r\n\r\nsaid  even Dictator Hitler allowed the people a chance to say 'no', and did  not\r\n\r\nforce  them  to  put  in  blank  votes which ultimately  meant  votes  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. This is a clause that has caused a further reduction in the ranks of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. and I only hope that more will be able to stand up for the rights and\r\n\r\ninterests of the people of Singapore. The P.A.P. say that this Bill is based  on\r\n\r\nthe  traditions of the best parliamentary system. I want to know  where  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  they can produce an example or a precedent of such a parliamentary system\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If any Minister\r\n\r\ntries  to  do that at this stage, he will be out of order.

Imagine, Sir, a voter faced with two unacceptable questions.\r\n\r\nWhat is he to do? If he does not go\r\n\r\nto  vote, if he boycotts the referendum, clause 21, sub-clause (5) says that his\r\n\r\nname  will be expunged from the electoral register. Sub-clause (7) says that  he\r\n\r\ncan have his name restored after payment of $5, but his name may not be restored\r\n\r\nto  the  electoral  register until the next ensuing revision of  such  electoral\r\n\r\nregister. In fact, there may be no revision at all and, in the meantime,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nafter this referendum, a general election may be held. So the voter will be  \r\n\r\ndeprived  of a voice in the formation and in the choosing of a new government.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  think this is justice. I suppose these are the finer points which  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister with his legal training has added, in order that the voter  may\r\n\r\nbe forced into that so-called zugzwang position -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

That is the reason  why\r\n\r\nsymbols have to be used.\r\n\r\nYet he is suggesting this to the voter.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for Anson has already pointed out that this solution of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  will only cause the voter to contravene the basic principle of  voting\r\n\r\nand destroy the secrecy of the vote.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to say, Sir, that this suggestion of the Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nsomething  more sinister. The powers of the Government are very great.  Although\r\n\r\nthey have only 25, they are still the Government, and it would be very difficult\r\n\r\nfor  a lot of people to come out openly to oppose them. People like us will tell\r\n\r\nthem so, straight in the face, that we oppose them all the time. But there are a\r\n\r\nlot  of  people who are not in the happy position that we are in, and they  dare\r\n\r\nnot openly tell the Government that they oppose them although in their heart  of\r\n\r\nhearts they wish that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government were dead and gone, and gone forever, never to return.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this suggestion of the Prime Minister has something more sinister and\r\n\r\ncannot  so  easily be accepted by the people. So you see, Sir, what  sort  of  a\r\n\r\nzugzwang the voter finds himself in. If he boycotts the voting, he will get some\r\n\r\npunishment. If he comes along and tears his own ballot paper one way or another,\r\n\r\nhe  will  be  punished in one form or another. If he puts in  his  vote,  it  is\r\n\r\nagainst his conscience. If he puts in a blank vote, he gets swindled by  a  very\r\n\r\ndishonest Government. Is this the meaning of free choice? Is this the meaning of\r\n\r\ndemocracy that the P.A.P. always talk so much about?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as has already been repeatedly pointed out to you, this blank vote clause\r\n\r\nis merely to allow the Government a chance to convert their minority of, say, 10\r\n\r\nper cent votes into a 100 per cent victory. But what makes this plot\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmore  sinful and devilish is that in stealing those votes the P.A.P.

That he cannot do. What he can do is to say that\r\n\r\nthe  clause is defective because it does not tell the Superintendent to declare\r\n\r\nthe result of the voting detail by detail. That is all he can say, and he cannot\r\n\r\nnow debate on the merits of the amendment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir, I was not going to bring out the merits or demerits of the amendment.

Yet in our Referendum Bill there  is  no\r\n\r\nproper  form  in which the results of the voting can be stated clearly  for  the\r\n\r\ninformation of the people. Then what sort of voting is this? They might as  well\r\n\r\ngrab  all  the votes and say, \"We have won.\" Why have the voting?  How  are  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  know how they have voted? Surely even if the P.A.P. want  to  steal\r\n\r\nthose  votes, let them be brave enough and courageous enough to tell the  people\r\n\r\nthe number of votes they have stolen. This declaration here, Sir, to be included\r\n\r\nby  the  Superintendent in his declaration of the result of the referendum,  has\r\n\r\nbeen specially put in and is meant to be vague and to mislead the people so that\r\n\r\nthey  might not know about the evil intentions of the Government concerning  the\r\n\r\nblank  votes.

The provisions which stop people from paying visits to houses will  make\r\n\r\npolling  day a day of curfew. Such provisions are inappropriate in  a  Bill  of\r\n\r\nthis Sort.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, since I last spoke, I have come upon another referendum which is  going\r\n\r\nto  be  held in the territory of Uganda. I refer you now to the London Times  of\r\n\r\n28th June, page 9. The issue involved is how two countries in Uganda are to  be\r\n\r\ndisposed of: whether it belongs to the Kingdom of Bunyoro or to the Kingdom  of\r\n\r\nBuganda. Both kingdoms claim these two what they call lost counties. A referendum  is  going to be held in these two lost counties to ask the people to decide\r\n\r\nbetween  three choices. First, to remain under the  rule of Buganda. Second,\r\n\r\nto  be  transferred to Bunyoro's rule. Third, to remain  permanently  under\r\n\r\nCentral  Government control, namely, that of the central Government of  Uganda,\r\n\r\nwhich  includes  the  kingdoms of Bunyoro and Buganda. Sir,  this  has  been\r\n\r\nprocessed no doubt by some of their best men in the British Treasury,  on  the\r\n\r\nBench, men trained in the highest traditions of, parliamentary democracy. They\r\n\r\nare  presented  with a thorny problem - two kingdoms claim two  lost  counties.\r\n\r\nNobody  has been mad enough to suggest to ask the people of Buganda, \"Do  you\r\n\r\nwish  to join Buganda; yes or no? And if the answer is no, then you remain  lost\r\n\r\ncounties.\" But very sensibly\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthey  have  said,  \"Your future can be determined in one  of  three  practicable\r\n\r\nalternatives - either you go with Buganda, under which you are  now  administered;\r\n\r\nor  you go with Bunyoro; or you remain outside Buganda and outside Bunyoro under\r\n\r\nthe  Central Government.

He is not interested in a referendum, it does not achieve his purpose.\r\n\r\nPeople  are  not  accustomed, he said, to a referendum; they do not  understand.\r\n\r\nSir, we have paid due regard to what he says. We always do, Sir.\r\n\r\nWhatever they say, we listen most attentively, even when it is repeated for  the\r\n\r\ntenth  time,  in case there is a variation or a change of mind, or a  change  of\r\n\r\nheart. Because possibly some people may not understand. They may not cast  their\r\n\r\nvote  at  all, because they may not be able to understand the symbols, they  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  able  to  read  the two propositions that we intend  to  put  to  them.\r\n\r\nTherefore, since nobody suggests that because some voters cannot understand, the\r\n\r\nwhole nation should remain undecided. Obviously, the nation must\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ndecide;  a decision has to be made and proceeded with. The obvious thing is  not\r\n\r\nto  proceed  against the resolution of this House, but in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nresolution  of  this House. What is undemocratic about that?  If  a  man  understands  the  issues, intelligent, educated man like the Member for  Queenstown;\r\n\r\nhe  is  literate, Sir, although from time to time he makes noises which suggest\r\n\r\nthere  are  more  primeval instincts in him. I am sure he  understands.  I  was\r\n\r\ntalking  of  primeval  instincts  and  it  immediately  drew  a  response.   He\r\n\r\nunderstands  it, he knows the process, and he marks his choice. All  right.  So\r\n\r\nbe  it,  the  lesser of the two evils. He does not want both.  Either  way,  he\r\n\r\nknows  a  cordon will be closed. He knows this is zugzwang. He  does  not  want\r\n\r\nmerger.  He is against it on principle. But, of course, he made the unfortunate\r\n\r\nmistake  of publicly saying he wanted more merger -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

At the  end\r\n\r\nof  it all, what do we get? We have two bundles and a little bit extra, a third,\r\n\r\nwhere  chaps like the Member for Queenstown will indicate that they do not  wish\r\n\r\nto  be  counted in at all. One bundle will indicate those who are in  favour  of\r\n\r\nalternative  A; one bundle will indicate those who are in favour of  alternative\r\n\r\nB, and  the  duty of the Superintendent is to announce the result;  thereby  it\r\n\r\nbecomes  the  duty  of the Government to follow the will of the  electorate  and\r\n\r\nbring  about  merger; much to the discomfiture of the Member for  Queenstown.

Physically using such a Bill to defend democracy is  just\r\n\r\nlike  asking a patient to take opium or morphine. In the whole history  of  this\r\n\r\nLegislature,  this  Bill is on the negative side. There is not  in  the  Bill  a\r\n\r\nsingle positive encouragement to the people's confidence in democracy. There are\r\n\r\nmany  clauses  in the Referendum Bill but no clause to encourage the  people  to\r\n\r\nexpress  freely their choice in regard to the questions on merger.  On  the  contrary,  the  Bill contains many clauses which seek to restrict and  exploit  the\r\n\r\npeople's  right to express their free choice. There is not a single clause  that\r\n\r\nencourages  the  people  and the different political Parties  to  express  their\r\n\r\ndetailed plans for merger.

Actually  the  main aims of the  debates  in  this  House  and\r\n\r\ndiscussions  in the Select Committee are to accept the views of the  people.  \r\n\r\nRepresentatives of various people's societies and organisations have  \r\n\r\nappeared  before  the  Select  Committee and expressed their criticisms and  \r\n\r\nsuggestions  in\r\n\r\nregard  to the unreasonable clauses in the Bill, but the Government has paid  no\r\n\r\nattention whatsoever to these criticisms and suggestions. On the contrary, after\r\n\r\nthe  Second  Reading and the Committee stage on this Bill, the  Government  have\r\n\r\nimposed  another more unreasonable clause. During the proceedings on the  Second\r\n\r\nReading, we can see another characteristic of the Government, that is, they have\r\n\r\nno  answers to the criticisms by societies and unions and political Parties.  On\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, the Government are afraid of the views of the political Parties\r\n\r\nand of being put into a mess.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the final stage of the Second Reading, some Ministers suggested some\r\n\r\nclauses that after the merger of Singapore and the Federation, the Bill would\r\n\r\nbe  discarded. This proves that the Government agree that many clauses  in  this\r\n\r\nBill  do  not  have  the approval of the people, because these  clauses  are  unreasonable.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, this Bill should not be read a Third time, because the\r\n\r\nclauses in the Bill are basically inadequate. During its Second Reading, we have\r\n\r\nseen the Government use unreasonable ways to get it through. We are not prepared\r\n\r\nto  go  through  clause  by  clause  to  say  which  clause  is  inadequate  and\r\n\r\nunreasonable  and which is forcibly put in. We can only generally say  that,  on\r\n\r\nthe  whole, in the whole history of this Legislature, the sole aim of the ruling\r\n\r\nParty  is to attack the Opposition Parties through the clauses of this Bill.  To\r\n\r\nachieve this, some of the clauses of the Bill exploit the fundamental rights\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nof  the people - that is, they are contrary to established and ordinary laws. Just\r\n\r\nnow, our Leader as well as the Member for Anson pointed out the inadequacies  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, because, as regards the choice between \"Yes\" and \"No\", the Bill  does\r\n\r\nnot  specify  the  form  of  the ballot paper or how the  Superintendent  should\r\n\r\nannounce the voting results.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has clearly pointed out that in our Elections Ordinance,\r\n\r\nthere  are  altogether  17 Schedules. In our present National  Referendum  Bill,\r\n\r\nthere is not even a Schedule, but there are some inadequacies. That is why  this\r\n\r\nBill should not be read a Third time.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out something that is of special interest and requires\r\n\r\nspecial attention. This point has been mentioned by the Member for Anson on  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading  of the Bill. It is clause 32. When a voter commits  an  offence\r\n\r\nunder  this clause, and if he is a Member of this House, he will have to  vacate\r\n\r\nhis seat here. But this is contrary to section 42, subsection (3), paragraph (a)\r\n\r\nof the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health on the Second Reading of this Bill confessed that this\r\n\r\nwas  a legal point needing the solution of legal experts. From this we can  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  provisions, the wording and the power as provided in the  clauses  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill are ultra vires the present Constitution. Whether those provisions are\r\n\r\ncorrect,  proper  or  legal will have to be decided upon  by  international  constitutional lawyers.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have decided upon those provisions only by the strength of their\r\n\r\nmajority vote of one. That is not the proper attitude to take in legislation  by\r\n\r\na government. The whole purpose of this Bill appears to be to put the Opposition\r\n\r\nParties to death. If that is so, this Bill should not be read a Third time,  and\r\n\r\nwe oppose its Third Reading.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, I am of the opinion that the P.A.P. Government, when passing\r\n\r\nthe Second Reading of this Bill did not have the majority support of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  Members  of the House. We consider that the P.A.P. gets its support  mainly\r\n\r\nfrom  U.M.N.O. and S.P.A.; and even U.M.N.O. and S.P.A., in fact, not  long  ago\r\n\r\ncondemned  this Bill, arguing that it is contrary to the views and will  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  is  undemocratic. On the Second Reading of the Bill,  when  several\r\n\r\nunreasonable and undemocratic provisions were discussed in this House,  U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nand  S.P.A.  Members took our side and criticised those clauses; but  now  under\r\n\r\npressure  from  the  Government of the Federation of Malaya, they  have  changed\r\n\r\ntheir stand. That is why the Bill passed its Second Reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen)</b>: The Member for Upper Serangoon is completely out of order when he\r\n\r\nalleges  that  the Opposition Members of U.M.N.O. and S.P.A. are under  pressure\r\n\r\nfrom the Federation Government. As he knows, a friendly government should not be\r\n\r\ndragged into a debate in this Chamber. Mr Chan Sun Wing.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nI  only wanted to point out that what I meant was that the P.A.P. Government could\r\n\r\nget  the  Bill  through its Second Reading because of that characteristic  event\r\n\r\nwhich helped them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, the passage of the Second Reading of this Bill will give the people of Singapore a very profound political lesson. That is why we support the\r\n\r\ncontention that the Bill should not be read a Third time. It is because we  feel\r\n\r\nthat   if   this  National  Referendum  Bill  were  passed  under  the   present\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  it would make the people come to the inevitable conclusion  that\r\n\r\nthe  law  can be manipulated by the Party in power. If this House were  to  pass\r\n\r\nsuch  an unreasonable Bill, then the House would be debasing the concept of  law\r\n\r\nand  would confuse the people as regards the true value of legislation, and that\r\n\r\nwould  go  contrary  to  the protection, preservation  and  maintenance  of  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic system.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, this point is very important, because the purpose of\r\n\r\nlegislation is to enable the people to respect the process of legislation and to  see\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nvalue  of law. Only when legislation is done in such a positive way can it bring\r\n\r\nsomething good to the system of democracy.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that in 1959 at the general elections, the Prime Minister made a speech\r\n\r\nat  a  mass  rally  in  Fullerton Square, and quoted the history  of  the  Asian\r\n\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> We are now having a general debate on the Third Reading of\r\n\r\nthis Bill, and I do not see any relevancy in the reference to the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwhen  he  talked about the Asian revolution in 1959. If the Member continues  on\r\n\r\nthat line, he is completely irrelevant to the Third Reading of this Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe this point is very relevant. I only want  to\r\n\r\nquote  a  very  short  passage - just  one instance.  It  is  because  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment want to force this Bill through. We oppose this Bill and we tell them\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  achieve the purpose of democracy and service to the  people  which\r\n\r\nthey claimed was what they wanted to do. As they have said before, the value  of\r\n\r\na  government  does not depend on how many houses or hospitals or  what - not  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  built. The most important thing is to reform  society  and  to\r\n\r\nenable the people to understand the system of democracy, the Legislature and  to\r\n\r\nchange  their  views in regard to this House and their views on  the  government\r\n\r\nmachinery;  because in the past the people did not value very much these  organi\r\n\r\nsations  because  they were under a colonial government. But if  the  Government\r\n\r\nwere  to  pass  this Bill in this House, they would not be able  to  change  our\r\n\r\npeople's hatred towards these organisations and institutions as they had under a\r\n\r\ncolonial  government. Under these circumstances, as I have earlier pointed  out,\r\n\r\nthe measures adopted by the Government are\r\n\r\njust like giving a patient opium or morphine. It may perhaps prolong the life of\r\n\r\nthe  patient  or stimulate him for some time, but in the end, the  days  of  the\r\n\r\npatient will be numbered. It is only a matter of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntime.

The question of merger has been fully  debated\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly, and the Assembly has accepted the principle of merger.  What\r\n\r\nremains to be done now is to get the views of the people on the mode and  manner\r\n\r\nin which merger should be\r\n\r\nrealised.  It  is  only  for  this reason that  the  Referendum  Bill  has  been\r\n\r\nintroduced. Having failed in every other way to frustrate merger, they  are  now\r\n\r\nattempting to prevent this Bill from becoming law by attacking especially clause\r\n\r\n29  pertaining  to unmarked and uncertain ballot papers. If they had  their  own\r\n\r\nway,  they would probably have a clause of their own to legalise the destruction\r\n\r\nand  defacement of ballot papers, so that their sinister aims could be achieved.\r\n\r\nClause 29 would never have\r\n\r\nfound its way into the Bill had it not been for the attempt by the Communists to\r\n\r\ndestroy  and deface ballot papers. This is the only way to defeat the Communists\r\n\r\nand their stooges in their further attempt to wreck the referendum and merger.\r\n\r\n                            \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's intention in introducing clause 29 is only to prevent the\r\n\r\nCommunists from wrecking the Referendum Bill with a view to frustrating\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmerger.

If, on the other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  people were left to decide freely for themselves, there will,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure,  be  very  few  blank votes, which is exactly what the Barisan  and  their\r\n\r\nCommunist  ranks  fear.

We  are  therefore\r\n\r\ndetermined  to  see  that merger is not foiled by the evil machinations  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  The reunion of the two territories will bring possible an  economic\r\n\r\nstability which will enable us to build a more prosperous society.

I must not allow this. If the Minister now goes on that\r\n\r\ntack, that is going to invite a debate on that subject. I cannot allow it on the\r\n\r\nThird Reading of this Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I just wanted to make the position clear; it is not a matter\r\n\r\nof  great moment. Well, let us get down to the basic issues of this Bill. To me,\r\n\r\nthey  are clear and simple, and all the arguments have been concentrated in  the\r\n\r\nmain  on  two  clauses - clause 5 and clause 29. In the first instance,  that  is\r\n\r\nclause  5,  the issue was whether only one form of merger should  be  posed  for\r\n\r\nacceptance  or  rejection  or whether, as Government  claims,  there  should  be\r\n\r\nalternative  choices  or possible forms of merger. As regards  the  latter,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment claims that if the choices offered in the referendum are honest, then\r\n\r\nour amendments to clause 28 and 29 on the blank votes are fully justified.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there is very little doubt that both common sense and constitutional\r\n\r\nprecedents elsewhere support the Government's stand in regard to clause 5;  that\r\n\r\nis,  it  will  be  perfectly  correct and proper to  pose  alternatives  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum.  All  the Opposition did was to quote examples in  other  countries\r\n\r\nwhere a single question is submitted to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\na  referendum  which  admits of a yes or no answer, but they  have  conveniently\r\n\r\nignored  referenda  in  other  countries whose  situations  at  that  time  were\r\n\r\ndistinctly similar to ours. So I think in regard to the amendments to clause  5,\r\n\r\nthe  Government's case is overwhelming. So the Opposition's next line of  attack\r\n\r\nis  to  say  that the alternative we are posing in the referendum is a dishonest\r\n\r\nrepresentation of their stand.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as there is going to be a debate on this subject, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do\r\n\r\nnot  intend  to  dwell at length on it. I only want to say that  if  charges  of\r\n\r\ndishonesty  are made, then there must be certain tests which can be applied,  so\r\n\r\nthat  a proper judgment can be reached. One test is a purely technical one which\r\n\r\nrequires that the question should be clear, unbiased and easily understood,  and\r\n\r\nI  think  on  this  ground there is not much difference of opinion  between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Opposition. But there is the other test which gives  rise  to\r\n\r\nheated  debate  and  upon  which I want to dwell at  some  length.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  and  the Workers' Party say that an honest question  is  one  that  is\r\n\r\nacceptable to them;\r\n\r\nthat is to say, they say that the form of a merger to be put to a referendum can\r\n\r\nbe  considered  honest  only if it is approved by the Barisan  Sosialis  or  the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party. Now, Sir, I regard this contention as sheer nonsense. Whether  a\r\n\r\nparty approves or disapproves any question or questions put to the referendum is\r\n\r\npurely a subjective matter.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think if the Minister goes into details he will be\r\n\r\nirrelevant  to the Third Reading. This would be an argument which can be put forward\r\n\r\nwhen  we  debate the Prime Minister's motion. In passing, he can  just  indicate\r\n\r\nwhat is in his mind, but he should not go into details, otherwise he will excite\r\n\r\na debate in a debate.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am just trying to summarise the arguments that were\r\n\r\nadvanced in the Committee of the Assembly on clause 5.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

If a Member thinks it is undesirable, then he votes against  the\r\n\r\nThird Reading.

I  cannot  understand why the Barisan Sosialis should  say  that  the\r\n\r\nclause  as  proposed by the Government is improper and would lead to undesirable\r\n\r\nconsequences. I think they base their objections to the Government  position  on\r\n\r\nthis  clause in that they will not be able to put their own proposition  at  the\r\n\r\nreferendum.  They  will not be able to say that the type of  merger  which  they\r\n\r\nfavour - complete  merger  with automatic conversion of  Singapore  citizens  into\r\n\r\nFederal citizens - will not go in, and in particular the Member for Nee Soon,  who\r\n\r\nis the most agile intellectual among them, tried to justify the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nstand  on that and he stated the position of his Party in page 62 of the  script\r\n\r\ndated 28th June, 1962 [Hansard Vol. 18, No. 2, col. 236]. He disagreed with  our\r\n\r\nstand,  that  the  two choices offered under this clause would be  adequate  and\r\n\r\nacceptable  because  we  say  that  one of the alternatives  would  be  complete\r\n\r\nequality  with  the  other States. Now, he says and he has  quoted  me  in  this\r\n\r\nreference:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister for Finance keeps on harping on his theme that we can get only\r\n\r\nwhat  the  other eleven States got. But the Prime Minister himself at the  Radio\r\n\r\nForum, during one of the moments when he thought he was clever, stated that  the\r\n\r\nvarious  States of the Federation of Malaya got into the Federation at different\r\n\r\nlevels. For instance, he said that Pahang got in on better terms than Johore and\r\n\r\nJohore  go in on better terms than Penang or Malacca.

Now, Sir, if you cut through all  his\r\n\r\nwaffle,  what the hon. Member meant really is this; that all the States  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  are  equal but some are more equal than others.

That was what  we  told  the  people\r\n\r\nthrough all the possible media of publicity, but we found that before the debate\r\n\r\nit  was  rather difficult to convince the majority of the people. Many  of  them\r\n\r\nsaid  that we were trying to impute motives on our political opponents and  they\r\n\r\ntherefore  preferred to reserve their judgment, but during the debate  on  these\r\n\r\ntwo  clauses  we  found that more and more people began to understand  the  real\r\n\r\npurpose  of these two clauses and they are now convinced - as I have said  before,\r\n\r\nnot  because  of what we have said but of what the Barisan Sosialis  have  said - \r\n\r\nthat  the Barisan Sosialis are opposed to any form of merger and that they  will\r\n\r\ninstigate people to cast blank votes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me give a concrete example of this, and I refer to a Member of this\r\n\r\nAssembly  who  will be able to bear witness here. Before these two clauses  were\r\n\r\ndiscussed in this Assembly, I tried\r\n\r\nto  convince the Member for Tanglin that these two clauses are desirable because\r\n\r\nwe want to checkmate the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  from  creating mischief. I said that they did not want merger  in  any\r\n\r\nform  whatsoever and that during the referendum they would instigate  people  to\r\n\r\ncast  blank votes. Now, Sir, everybody knows that the Member for Tanglin is  not\r\n\r\nonly  an  honest  man  but  a God-fearing man and his sincerity  in  matters  of\r\n\r\npersonal  conviction, I think, is beyond any dispute. But when I  tried  to  convince  him of our stand on these two clauses, he was most dubious. He asked  me,\r\n\r\nwhy should the Barisan Sosialis want to do this shady, complicated and dishonest\r\n\r\nthing?  I  tried to give a political analysis with reasons, but  he  thought  it\r\n\r\nstill  looked  very  odd to him although he was willing to concede  that  having\r\n\r\nworked  with  the Communists and their stooges for so long we were in  the  best\r\n\r\nposition  to  understand how they think, plot and act. He  conceded  that  there\r\n\r\nmight be something in what we said about these two clauses.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he preferred to reserve\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\njudgment.  But after listening to the speeches of the Barisan Sosialis  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber,  he is now completely convinced that what we said is correct. In  fact,\r\n\r\nhe went on further and told me that in the situation which we are facing on this\r\n\r\nreferendum, blank votes are not blank votes in the ordinary sense of  the  word.\r\n\r\nIn  normal  circumstances, a blank vote means a person is undecided and  has  no\r\n\r\nopinion one\r\n\r\nway or the other, but the Member for Tanglin said - and he can confirm it\r\n\r\nthat  blank votes in the coming referendum would have a most sinister  meaning;\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis would instigate the people to cast blank votes through the\r\n\r\nracialist and pro-Communist propaganda line they would claim that merger in  any\r\n\r\nform whatsoever would mean the subjection of the Chinese by the Malays.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Minister will be right if he goes on with\r\n\r\nthose details. Up till now, he is\r\n\r\nall  right; he is completely relevant. I do not think he should go into  further\r\n\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Sir, the point I want to make is that these clauses\r\n\r\nare  desirable and in this matter I made the point that the Member for  Tanglin,\r\n\r\nwho  could  not  understand  the  position at  the  outset,  is  now  completely\r\n\r\nconvinced; after having heard what the Barisan Sosialis themselves have said, he\r\n\r\nsays  that a blank vote in these circumstances is not a blank vote but a  loaded\r\n\r\nvote and, as such, clauses 28 and 29 are necessary to ensure that this menace is\r\n\r\nproperly  dealt with. Well, I am greatly gratified at this change of  conviction\r\n\r\non the part of the Member for Tanglin, but as I said. I cannot claim much credit\r\n\r\nfor  it  because it was really the Barisan Sosialis who convinced him of it,  because speaker after speaker from the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis said that if the choice were complete merger on an equal  basis\r\n\r\nwith  any of the eleven States of the White Paper merger, then the people  would\r\n\r\ncast  blank  votes and would make no bones about their position in  this  event.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this is a complete justification for clauses\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n28  and  29.  As I say, the real purpose and intention of these clauses  is  now\r\n\r\ngetting  wider  and  wider  recognition. To me, the fact  that  people  are  now\r\n\r\nbecoming  more  and  more aware of the purposes which  clauses  28  and  29  are\r\n\r\nintended  to serve is a major victory on the part of the Government,  a  victory\r\n\r\nwhich, as I have said before, was gained by us with the unintended and unwitting\r\n\r\nassistance of the Barisan Sosialis. I would almost like to thank them for  that,\r\n\r\nbut  since  the  results which we have achieved are very gratifying - though  they\r\n\r\nwere unintended - I must, therefore, withhold any expression of gratitude.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  this is the final round that we, the Opposition, are fighting  against\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  and  against  the P.A.P.

Government is  sincere\r\n\r\nenough and honest enough to the people, then this Bill should be introduced  for\r\n\r\nthe purpose of holding a referendum to ascertain the wishes of the people on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  merger with the Federation of Malaya. Sir, if  there  is  no  such\r\n\r\nmerger issue in which the basic rights of our people are to be deprived, then  I\r\n\r\nbelieve there will not be such a heated debate in this Assembly. Sir, the merger\r\n\r\nissue and the Referendum Bill, which are both inter-related, would not become  a\r\n\r\ncontroversial issue in this country. Now in every corner of Singapore people are\r\n\r\ncursing the Bill and cursing the P.A.P. Ministers. We in this Assembly time  and\r\n\r\nagain reminded and warned the P.A.P. Ministers that if they insisted on the sell-out  merger and the undemocratic clauses of the Referendum Bill, then they would\r\n\r\nface  great opposition in this Assembly and outside the Assembly. In the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Bras  Basah has now walked across  the  Floor  to  oppose  the\r\n\r\ndictatorial  and undemocratic attitude of the leadership of the  P.A.P. and  to\r\n\r\noppose the sell-out merger that the P.A.P.

Sir, the P.A.P. Government does not allow people to have  the  final\r\n\r\nsay  on  any  and  all matters affecting their constitutional  status.  All  the\r\n\r\nillegal steps to stop the people from expressing their own free will are now put\r\n\r\ninto words and clauses in this Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will of the people shall be the will of the Government. That is to say, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  do things according to the wishes of the  people  and  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people. In other words, the Government must first consult  the\r\n\r\npeople  on  matters affecting the people and affecting the nation. After  having\r\n\r\ngot  a mandate from the people, the Government can then proceed according to the\r\n\r\nwishes  of  the people. Only by this way can the views of the people  be  freely\r\n\r\nexpressed and freely consulted. But what do we see in this Bill? I am not  going\r\n\r\nto  read  out the clauses which have been thoroughly discussed in the Committee.\r\n\r\nAll  I  want  to say is that when a referendum is held to decide the  matter  of\r\n\r\nmerger  the  people will not be allowed to say yes and no. The  people  will  be\r\n\r\nforced  to choose between two and more unacceptable proposals submitted to  them\r\n\r\nby  the Government in the referendum. They will not be given a chance to abstain\r\n\r\nor  to reject any questions proposed by the Government. Since the people have no\r\n\r\nright  to  reject  or  to abstain but to accept, where then are  the  democratic\r\n\r\nrights of the people?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the period of referendum is the period of fear and torture, it is a period\r\n\r\nwhere  people,  especially political workers and party  members,  excluding,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the P.A.P. members, will not be able to move freely, to talk freely  and\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwork  freely  so as to explain to the people about merger and about the  \r\n\r\nreferendum.  Sir, where can we exercise our democratic rights that the \r\n\r\npeople of  Singapore are fighting for? Now we see the basic rights of our \r\n\r\npeople deprived by the Government  whom  the people elected in 1959. Just \r\n\r\nnow I said the  will  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  shall  be  the will of the Government, but the will  of  the  Government\r\n\r\ncannot  be the will of the people especially on matters affecting all the people\r\n\r\nof  the  nation.  Why then did the P.A.P. Government, who were  elected  by  the\r\n\r\npeople, become so dictatorial? Why did the Government introduce such a Bill with\r\n\r\nso many clauses prohibiting people from exercising their democratic rights on  a\r\n\r\nnational  issue  such as merger? It is because the interest of the  P.A.P.,  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the colonialists, and the interests of the colonial stooges are  now\r\n\r\ncoming  into conflict with the people and there are only two ways for  them  to\r\n\r\nchoose.

The second  is\r\n\r\nto fight for the interest of themselves and for the colonialists and their agents\r\n\r\nbut  against the interest of the people. But it is a pity the the P.A.P. choose\r\n\r\nthe second one. They want to appear as democrats and leaders of the people. They\r\n\r\nsay to the people, \"You will have a say in matters of merger and we will have  a\r\n\r\nreferendum.\" But what do we see in this P.A.P. Referendum Bill?

He said  that  the  Bill  was  a\r\n\r\nspecific  Bill to enable a referendum on merger to be held, but that  Government\r\n\r\nhas  dishonestly said that this is a general Referendum Bill and pretended  that\r\n\r\nunder  this  Bill referenda could be held on toddy shops, Malay as the  official\r\n\r\nlanguage, and  smoking,  so that the provisions which  were  usually  found  in\r\n\r\nspecific Referendum Bills would not find a place in this Bill. He said  that  if\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  were  a  specific Bill on merger, it would  have  included  Schedules\r\n\r\nproviding for the form of a ballot paper and a format for the returns to be made\r\n\r\nby  the Superintendent. He quoted, as examples, the Referendum (Federation) Law,\r\n\r\n1960,  of Jamaica and the Newfoundland Referendum Act. Sir, the scope of a  Bill\r\n\r\nis  indicated  by  its  Long Title, and if the Member for Anson  had  taken  the\r\n\r\ntrouble to look more closely at the legislation to which he referred the  House,\r\n\r\nhe  would  have  found that there is a difference in the Long  Titles  of  these\r\n\r\nenactments  and  the Long Title of our Bill. The Long Title  of  the  Referendum\r\n\r\nFederation Law, 1960, of Jamaica is in the following terms:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A law to provide for the ascertainment by means of a referendum of the opinion of the people of Jamaica with respect to the continued participation of Jamaica in the Federation of the West Indies.'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Long Title of the Referendum Act of Newfoundland of 1948 is in the following terms:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'An Act to provide for ascertaining at the referendum the wish of the people\r\n\r\nas to the future form of government of Newfoundland.'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Long Title of the New Zealand Military Training Poll Act of 1949 which the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee has also considered is in the following terms:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'An Act to provide for a poll relating to compulsory military training.'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Long Title of our Referendum Bill, on the other hand, states that\r\n\r\nBill is an Ordinance to provide for the holding of a national referendum and for\r\n\r\nmatters connected therewith. It does not follow that any legislation enabling  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  to be held in Singapore on merger must take the form of  a  specific\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill restricting the scope of the Bill to the merger issue, and if it\r\n\r\ndoes  not,  then the Bill is open to the charge that it does not conform  to  accepted  parliamentary practice. This is utter nonsense, Sir.  Sir,  whether  the\r\n\r\nlong  Title  of a Bill restricts its scope to the holding of a referendum  on  a\r\n\r\nspecific national issue or whether it enlarges the scope of the Bill to enable a\r\n\r\nreferendum to be held on any national issue is not of any importance, as all  referendum legislation, whether it takes the form of specific Referendum Bills  or\r\n\r\na  general Bill, must contain provisions which will enable the question or  questions to be put to the electorate, must include the procedure which is to be followed in the holding of a referendum, and must provide safeguards to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  referendum  is  fairly and honestly conducted. That is why  all  referendum\r\n\r\nlegislation either imports the identical provisions of the electoral  procedures\r\n\r\nand  the  laws  governing  the holding of general elections  in  the  referendum\r\n\r\nlegislation itself, or specifically requires that recourse should be had to  the\r\n\r\nprocedure set out in the laws governing the holding of general elections for the\r\n\r\npurpose of holding a referendum.

Such  a  limitation  is\r\n\r\nalso  without precedent as referenda have been held in Newfoundland,  Australia,\r\n\r\nNew Zealand and the Cameroons, where more than one question have been put to the\r\n\r\nelectorate  and  where the electors have been invited to make a  choice  of  one\r\n\r\nquestion without being required to answer in the affirmative or negative to each\r\n\r\nof  the  questions put. In the case of the Cameroons, the referendum  was  supervised by the United Nations itself, and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  procedure of the choice of one of two questions received the approval  from\r\n\r\nan unimpeachable source.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference between our Bill and the referendum enactments of Newfoundland, New Zealand and Jamaica is that the questions placed before the electorate in these enactments are incorporated in a section of these enactments.\r\n\r\nGovernment  has already tabled a notice of a motion indicating the questions  to\r\n\r\nbe  put  to  the electorate on the merger issue, and this motion will soon  be\r\n\r\ndebated  in  the  Assembly.  If  these questions receive  the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  then they will be put to the electorate by an Order of  the  Head  of\r\n\r\nState made under the provisions of clause 5 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what difference then does it make whether the questions are incorporated in\r\n\r\nthe  text of the Bill itself in a specific referendum Bill, or whether the  questions,  after  debate and approval of the Legislative Assembly are  put  to  the\r\n\r\nelectorate by way of an Order of the Head of State made under the provisions  of\r\n\r\nclause 5 of the Bill?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also said that if a specific Referendum Bill had been\r\n\r\nintroduced  by  Government  on  the question of  merger,  the  Bill  would  have\r\n\r\ncontained  Schedules indicating the form of the ballot paper and the  format  of\r\n\r\nthe  return which the Superintendent would have been required to make after  the\r\n\r\nholding  of  the referendum. Sir, I have here with me the actual  texts  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation Act, of Newfoundland of 1948, the Federation Law of Jamaica of\r\n\r\n1960, and the New Zealand Military Training Poll Act of 1949; all copies printed\r\n\r\nby the Government Printers of these territories.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Newfoundland Referendum Act of 1948 has 25 clauses with not a single\r\n\r\nSchedule. The Jamaica Referendum Act has six clauses with not a single Schedule,\r\n\r\nand  the New Zealand Military Training Poll Act of 1949 has six clauses with one\r\n\r\nSchedule  indicating the question that is to be put to the electorate. How  then\r\n\r\ncan  the  Member for Anson say that our general Referendum Bill is open  to  the\r\n\r\nobjection that it does not\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nconform  to accepted parliamentary practice, because no Schedules are  indicated\r\n\r\nin the text of the Bill?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also said that clause 21, which incorporates the\r\n\r\nidentical provisions of compulsory voting found in the Singapore Legislative  Assembly  Elections Ordinance into this Referendum Bill, is to be deplored because\r\n\r\nthe  voter  who fails to vote will have to wait until the next revision  of  the\r\n\r\nelectoral register before he can exercise his right to vote again. The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home  Affairs  has already told the House that 58,000  electors  failed  to\r\n\r\nrecord  their  votes in the last general election, and up to date a  very  small\r\n\r\nnumber  of them have taken the trouble to get their names restored to  the  electoral register. I cannot see how, in view of this evidence, it can seriously  be\r\n\r\nstated  that clause 21 is perfidious and dishonest and should not have  been  included  in  the  Referendum  Bill. A provision like clause  21  would  have  the\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  bringing home to the elector the existence of this added  penalty\r\n\r\nwhich will serve as a deterrent to voters keeping away from the referendum polls\r\n\r\nand  stimulating larger attendances at the polls, thereby helping to achieve the\r\n\r\nobject  for  which  compulsory  voting has been  introduced.  There  is  nothing\r\n\r\nundemocratic that I can see in such a provision.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the objection that the court should be given a discretion to impose a\r\n\r\nfine in respect of the offences enumerated in clauses 32, 38 and 42 of the Bill;\r\n\r\nthese  are  serious  offences,  and  it is  the  practice,  in  the  framing  of\r\n\r\nlegislation  where offences are serious, not to give the court a  discretion  to\r\n\r\nimpose a fine.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, the argument that the deprivation of civic rights following\r\n\r\non  a conviction for an offence under these clauses should be left to the discretion  of the court is without any substance. If there is to be a deprivation  of\r\n\r\ncivic  rights  following  upon  a conviction for  any  of  these  offences,  the\r\n\r\ndeprivation  should  be the same for everybody. It would make  nonsense  of  the\r\n\r\ndeprivation if it could vary from person to person.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nNor is there any substance in the argument that when an offence is committed  by\r\n\r\na  Member  of  the Assembly, he should, although deprived of his  civic  rights,\r\n\r\nnevertheless continue as a Member of the Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposition that it should not be an offence for an elector to\r\n\r\nintentionally deface his own ballot paper is too absurd to require  any  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration.  The  Member  for Anson and the Barisan  Sosialis  have  attacked\r\n\r\nclause  29  of  the Bill which provides that any person whose  ballot  paper  is\r\n\r\nunmarked  or uncertain is thereby deemed to accept or is willing to  accept  the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Legislative Assembly on the matter referred to referendum.  They\r\n\r\nhave  argued  that as there is to be compulsory voting, under this provision  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill,  a citizen is deprived of the fundamental human right of recording  a\r\n\r\nblank  vote and saying 'no' if unacceptable proposals from their point  of  view\r\n\r\nare  put  to the electorate. What they are contending for is what they claim  to\r\n\r\nbe  a democratic right to organise a campaign for the recording of blank votes,\r\n\r\nif  the  questions put to the electorate are unacceptable from  their  point  of\r\n\r\nview.  They are making a pretence that they are champions of parliamentary  democracy  and, at the same time, they say they are not prepared to accept questions\r\n\r\nwhich  will be put to the electorate after debate and approval by the  Assembly.\r\n\r\nThey  contend that even if the choice of questions receives the approval of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  after debate, if it is not acceptable from their point of  view,  then\r\n\r\nthey  should have the democratic right to organise a campaign for the  recording\r\n\r\nof  blank  votes to frustrate the referendum on merger. This clause in the  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  effectively check any move on their part to mount such a  campaign,  which\r\n\r\nthey could easily do by the malicious spreading of rumours and whispers that the\r\n\r\nvoter  would lose his citizenship if he made a choice. Surely there  is  nothing\r\n\r\nundemocratic and unconstitutional in taking counter measures to put  a  stop  to\r\n\r\nthis,  so long as the elector is given the freedom to make a democratic  choice.\r\n\r\nIt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  well known that in elections and by-elections blank votes form a very  negligible  proportion of the total votes cast, as there is no temptation for  anyone\r\n\r\nto  organise  a  campaign for the recording of blank votes.  Is  it  not  right,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that Government should take countermeasures to frustrate  what  they\r\n\r\npropose  to do? As the Prime Minister has already pointed out to the House,  the\r\n\r\nelector  has under the provision of clause 28 (1) (b) of the Bill the  right  to\r\n\r\nsay  'no' if he indicates his choice on the ballot paper and then writes in  his\r\n\r\nname and address by which he can be identified. Such votes will be rejected  and\r\n\r\nnot  included  in the count. Where then is there any substance in  the  argument\r\n\r\nthat  if  an unacceptable choice from their point of view is put to the elector,\r\n\r\nhe has no right to say 'no' if he considers his choice to be unacceptable?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 48 (1) (c) of the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance, there is a similar provision. The only modification made is that he will\r\n\r\nhave  to  indicate his choice before he identifies himself to nullify his  vote.\r\n\r\nSpeakers  on the Government side have during this debate repeatedly exposed  the\r\n\r\ndishonesty of the proposal which the Barisan Sosialis and its allies consider to\r\n\r\nbe an acceptable choice from their point of view. They, in fact, do not want merger but they have not got the courage to say so openly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis and its allies have also pressed for separate returns to\r\n\r\nbe  shown,  electoral  division  by electoral  division,  of  all  unmarked  and\r\n\r\nuncertain  votes  cast.  It has been explained that as there  is  no  political\r\n\r\ncontest  among candidates in constituencies in a referendum, there is no  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  such separate returns should he included in the Statement of the Referendum\r\n\r\nwhich the Superintendent has to publish under the provision of clause 30 of  the\r\n\r\nBill.  The  only information of any relevance in a referendum is the  number  of\r\n\r\nvotes  cast  in  respect  of  the questions put  to  the  electorate,  and  this\r\n\r\ninformation will be provided.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there is no reason why we should give the Barisan Sosialis and\r\n\r\ntheir manipulators outside the Assembly an opportunity of mounting a campaign of\r\n\r\ncalumny and falsehoods by showing separate returns of such votes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new amendment which the Minister for Home Affairs has introduced to\r\n\r\nclause  43  of  the  Bill has been referred to as an example of  the  depths  of\r\n\r\nperfidy  and  dishonesty  to  which the Government  has  descended  in  this  un\r\n\r\ndemocratic Bill. The housewife who goes shopping on referendum polling  day  and\r\n\r\nthe farmer and hawker who go about their daily routine on referendum polling day\r\n\r\nhave  no reason whatsoever to be afraid of the provisions of this clause.  These\r\n\r\nprovisions  provide  the  machinery whereby those  who  organise  canvassing  on\r\n\r\nreferendum  polling day can be detected and brought to book for their  misdeeds.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing undemocratic in including such provisions in  this  Bill, as\r\n\r\nexperience  has  shown that where there are no means of detecting  and  bringing\r\n\r\noffenders  to  book  for  canvassing on polling  day,  the  prohibition  against\r\n\r\ncanvassing on polling day is quite meaningless.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An objection has also been taken by the Member for Anson to clause 52 (5) of\r\n\r\nthe Bill, which enables the Referendum Judge to take account of secret documents\r\n\r\nreferred to him by the State Advocate-General when he is to make a decision on a\r\n\r\nreferendum  petition.  I  have already pointed  out  to  the  House  that  in  a\r\n\r\nreferendum petition, there are no accused persons and there is no danger of this\r\n\r\nsecret  information being used to the prejudice of any individual  person.  Such\r\n\r\ninformation is necessary and useful to inform the Referendum Judge of  what  has\r\n\r\ntaken place to enable him to make a determination on the referendum petition.  I\r\n\r\nhave  also  pointed out that those who are called upon to show  cause  why  they\r\n\r\nshould not be reported for corrupt or illegal practices in a referendum will  be\r\n\r\ngiven an opportunity of being heard and of giving evidence and calling witnesses\r\n\r\nto  show  why they should not be so reported, and in such proceedings  The  Bill\r\n\r\ndoes not permit secret information available to the Judge\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\non  the referendum petition itself to be used against them. As there has been  a\r\n\r\nhue  and cry that a specific Referendum Bill should have been introduced for the\r\n\r\nmerger  issue itself, although, as I have shown, there is no substance  in  this\r\n\r\nobjection,  the  Government has introduced a new clause to the Bill  to  provide\r\n\r\nthat  it  will be repealed when merger is accomplished. Sir, I have disposed  of\r\n\r\nall  the matters which the Member for Anson and the Member for Queenstown  claim\r\n\r\nto  be undemocratic in this Bill. As this Bill is entirely satisfactory for  the\r\n\r\nholding  of  a  national  referendum on merger and  will  give  the  elector  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to make a democratic choice of the questions to be put to him  after\r\n\r\nsuch  questions  have received the approval of the Legislative Assembly.,  there\r\n\r\nis, therefore, no substance in the arguments which we have heard from the Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson and the Member for Queenstown. I ask the House to reject the amendment\r\n\r\nof the Member for Anson to the motion for the Third Reading of this Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, after the P.A.P. has been in power for three years,  this  is\r\n\r\nthe first time that this House has asked for the rejection of a Bill proposed by\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., that is, the National Referendum Bill. I believe this is the  first\r\n\r\ntime  in this House that we have this incident. If my memory is correct,  during\r\n\r\nthe  previous  Lim Yew Hock Government no occasion arose when  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse asked for the rejection of a certain Bill by the Government. Therefore, we\r\n\r\ncan see very clearly that the request for the rejection of the Third Reading  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill by the Opposition is justified.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this National Referendum Bill was tabled for the First\r\n\r\nReading in December last year, and we, the Opposition Parties, found that  there\r\n\r\nwere many undemocratic provisions in the original Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We cannot go as far back as that.

These amendments, in our opinion, would have a very great effect  on\r\n\r\nthe democratic rights of the people of Singapore. We cannot accept the fact that\r\n\r\nthe  Government should reject our reasonable amendments. I do not wish to  speak\r\n\r\nat  length on all these 34 amendments, but I wish to refer to the speeches  made\r\n\r\nby  the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Law. Their explanations cannot\r\n\r\ncover up their dictatorial acts and approach to this Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Law, a while ago, said that clause 5 is\r\n\r\nvery  reasonable  because in Newfoundland, New Zealand and Jamaica,  there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  similar  provisions. Therefore, the Government is correct in  posing  more\r\n\r\nthan  one question to the people in the coming national referendum. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Minister  for  Law tried to justify the P.A.P.  Government  as  being\r\n\r\ndemocratic  by  citing  examples from various foreign countries.  Just  now  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Law said that the main purpose of this Bill is that it  should  be\r\n\r\nused to conduct a national referendum on the question of merger. Therefore, this\r\n\r\nis  of national importance and affects the whole State. But we cannot accept the\r\n\r\nsimple examples given by the Minister for Law.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this question of national importance will be proposed by the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government,  namely,  Command Paper No.  33,  which  is  passed  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment with the support of the\r\n\r\nS.P.A.     Therefore, the question to be posed to the people should  be  Command\r\n\r\nPaper No. 33 and not other questions. This House has not debated other questions\r\n\r\nas  to the form of merger and, at the same time, the Government has not proposed\r\n\r\nother forms of merger to be debated in this House.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member says that the Government has not proposed any other\r\n\r\nforms of merger to be debated in this House.

Those  details\r\n\r\ncan be debated when we come to debating the Prime Minister's motion.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I wish to point out that since the Minister for Law has  said\r\n\r\nthat  this  Bill  was a specific Bill on the question of merger, therefore,  the\r\n\r\nquestion to be posed to the people should be Command Paper No. 33, that is,  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  merger proposals. Mr Speaker. Sir, a while ago the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance gave reasons why the Government wanted to put in clause 5 and clause  29\r\n\r\nin  this Bill. It was because these two clauses were intended to be used against\r\n\r\nthe  Communists, and also because we, the Barisan Sosialis, wanted to  take  the\r\n\r\nblank votes as negative votes. Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not demanded that blank\r\n\r\nvotes  should  be regarded as negative votes. Our stand is very  clear  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown has also expressed this stand on the question  of  blank\r\n\r\nvotes  very  clearly in the Select Committee. What we want is that  blank  votes\r\n\r\nshould  be considered as void and not as votes in support of or opposed  to  any\r\n\r\nproposal or question.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 4th July, when clause 29 was debated in this House,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Hong Lim moved an amendment, namely. In page A12, line  16,  to\r\n\r\ndelete  the  words \"accepts or is willing\" and insert the words \"rejects  or  is\r\n\r\nunwilling\".  That  is to say, the Member for Hong Lim wanted the  Government  to\r\n\r\nconsider blank votes, which the Government wanted to consider as votes accepting\r\n\r\nthe  decision  of  this House, to be considered as votes which are  against  the\r\n\r\ndecision of this House.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nWhen  the  amendment was put to the vote, the Member for Hong Lim  asked  for  a\r\n\r\ndivision. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the Official Report of this House on the 4th\r\n\r\nof  July, and the result of the voting was that three votes were in favour, that\r\n\r\nis, the Member for Aljunied, the Member for Punggol and the Member for Hong Lim.\r\n\r\nThese  were the votes in favour of the amendment. 25 votes were against, 4  were\r\n\r\nabsent,  and 19 votes abstained. Mr Speaker, Sir, these 19 votes that abstained\r\n\r\nincluded  the 13 Members of the Barisan Sosialis. Therefore, our stand  is  very\r\n\r\nclear  from this voting. We have not requested that blank votes should be deemed\r\n\r\nas  negative votes. Therefore, the tactics of debate adopted by the  P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nlike  that. When they are cornered, when they have no more arguments  to  offer,\r\n\r\nthey  will  try to distort our stand. However, the record of this House  clearly\r\n\r\nshows our stand on the question of blank votes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the only explanation of the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and the Minister for Finance with regard to the blank  votes\r\n\r\nis  Communist  instigation, because the Government  are  unable  to  cite  other\r\n\r\nprecedents and examples to justify their stand that blank votes should be deemed\r\n\r\nas votes in support of the Government. They are not able to justify their stand.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  under  these  circumstances, the Government  can  only  produce  the\r\n\r\npretext of Communists hoping to confuse the people and to make them believe that\r\n\r\nthese two clauses are reasonable. Mr Speaker, Sir, the opposition to clause  29\r\n\r\nis  not only confined to the Barisan Sosialis, the Member for Anson, the U.P.P.,\r\n\r\nthe  Liberal  Socialists, but the S.P.A. had also objected  to  clause  29.  But\r\n\r\nbecause  of  events  a  few days ago, the S.P.A. have to save  the  P.A.P. from\r\n\r\ncollapsing  and  to maintain their Government.

Now he can indicate why  he\r\n\r\nthinks it is undesirable if it is in the Bill, and will not serve the purpose of\r\n\r\nholding a referendum on merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I accept your instructions, but I have to point  out  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  here that their attitude towards blank votes, their only explanation\r\n\r\nis  because of Communist instigation. Such an explanation will not convince  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. Their statement that this is for use against the Communists\r\n\r\nwill not be accepted. The Government has said that all those who oppose the Bill\r\n\r\nare  Communists.  I  can  tell the P.A.P. Government  that  all  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, everyone of them, are against this clause with the exception of a few\r\n\r\nin front.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for Law said that, according to past\r\n\r\nelection  and  by-election  experience, blank votes were  negligible;  therefore\r\n\r\nclause  29  was  necessary. In the elections and by-elections blank  votes  were\r\n\r\nnegligible, it is true, but this time this is not an election or a by-election,\r\n\r\nit  is  a  national referendum. Especially with regard to clause 5 of the  Bill,\r\n\r\nsuch a clause makes the people of Singapore choiceless, so they have to put  in\r\n\r\nblank votes. Therefore, the explanation put forward by the Minister for Law  was\r\n\r\njust  to  hide  their dirty tactics so as to enable some people to believe  that\r\n\r\ntheir ways are reasonable.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Law also said that clauses 39 and 40 of the\r\n\r\nBill were necessary, but we feel that\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nsuch  severe  penalties  should  not appear in  a  democratic  society.  If  the\r\n\r\nquestions suggested by the Government were to be supported by the people,  there\r\n\r\nshould  not be such clauses. If the people would not object, such clauses  would\r\n\r\nnot  be  necessary. The questions posed by the Government are not wanted by  the\r\n\r\npeople. Therefore, in order to force all the citizens of Singapore to accept the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. suggestions, therefore, the Government has suggested clauses 38 and 39 to\r\n\r\noppress those citizens who are dissatisfied with the Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Law wants to give the impression to some\r\n\r\npeople that such occurrences are few, but in actual fact it is not so. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the Minister for Law also said that if people organised  parties  for\r\n\r\ncanvassing  on polling day, then clause 43 was necessary. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\ndebated  this question lengthily yesterday. The conclusion was that the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Law pointed out that such a provision was to deal with the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I pointed out yesterday that according to paragraph  (a)  of\r\n\r\nclause  43  (1),  no one can visit others. The Government thought  that  such  a\r\n\r\nparagraph  was necessary, and tried to suppress the people from visiting  others\r\n\r\nand  also  their political opponents. Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot  let  the  Government have such a provision to abuse their powers to deal with those whom they\r\n\r\ndo  not  like.  If such a provision were to be put to use, then I  say  that  in\r\n\r\nfuture referenda the Government could easily make use of this provision to  take\r\n\r\naction  against their political opponents when they now cannot do  so.  The  Government could then use this provision to the full to suppress those whom they do\r\n\r\nnot  like  and  also their political opponents. So we can clearly see  that  the\r\n\r\nwhole  Bill is in opposition to the will of the people. Therefore, the amendment\r\n\r\nmoved by the Member for Anson clearly explained that the Opposition Parties were\r\n\r\nthinking  of  the interests of the people. If the Government do  not  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration our views, then in future national referenda they will  adopt  the\r\n\r\ntactics of Hitler to oppress the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, why are the people of Singapore showing dissatisfaction with\r\n\r\nthis  Bill?  The  Member  for  Cairnhil has often  said  that  his  Party  is  a\r\n\r\nresponsible Party and is one that looks after the welfare of the people.  It  is\r\n\r\nnow  time for the S.P.A. to show their real stand as to whether or not they  are\r\n\r\nin support of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.    Government on this issue.

I think I know exactly when they want to hold\r\n\r\nthe  referendum, but in any case. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt in the mind\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan  Sosialis that this Bill is primarily meant for  holding  of  a\r\n\r\nreferendum on the merger issue.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Select Committee and also the Committee of the whole Assembly,\r\n\r\nand even just now when the Minister for Labour was speaking -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

But I say to this House that if  it  was  in  fact  a\r\n\r\ngeneral Referendum Bill to decide on matters like whether one should drink toddy\r\n\r\nor  whether one should smoke a pipe, we in the Barisan Sosialis would  not  have\r\n\r\ninitiated  a  marathon debate - which I am sure the Members have found  a  little\r\n\r\ntiresome. But because we know that the primary purpose of this Bill is to hold a\r\n\r\nreferendum on the issue of  merger,  we  have thought fit to make sure that we put forward all  our  arguments as clearly as possible, because after this Bill is passed, then, Sir, what\r\n\r\nis to happen is just anybody's guess.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nThere has been so much talk of parliamentary democracy. There has been a lot  to\r\n\r\ntalk  of the glories of parliamentary democracy, and so on. I can only say, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat if this Bill is passed with the present provisions, then it simply means \r\n\r\n- whether  the  Government Members want to admit it or  not - that  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore will lose confidence in the parliamentary system.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> That is what you want.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I have already stated that I do not want to claim to be a\r\n\r\nchampion  of  parliamentary democracy.

Sir,  all  this  talk - all   these\r\n\r\ncontradicting  statements - and conflicting talk of this general Referendum  Bill,\r\n\r\nMerger  Referendum Bill and so on and so on, I do not want to go and  quote  the\r\n\r\nvarious  statements the Ministers have made; they have been making contradicting\r\n\r\nstatements. At times to suit their convenience they have said this is a  general\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill; at times to suit their convenience again they have said this is\r\n\r\na Merger Referendum Bill. All this has confused and misled our people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis, knowing well that this is a Referendum Bill\r\n\r\nfor  merger,  are absolutely clear in our minds that the Bill is inadequate  and\r\n\r\nthat the provisions contained in it are completely inappropriate for the purpose\r\n\r\nof  ascertaining the views of our people on any issue, particularly on the issue\r\n\r\nof  merger which affects all our lives and the lives of our generations to come.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the Government's aim to hold a referendum under the provisions  of  this\r\n\r\nBill  to ensure continuity of their political survival. Sir, they think that  if\r\n\r\nthey  hold a referendum under this Bill they will zugzwang the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nthey will fix their political opponents, they will ultimately get a result which\r\n\r\nthey  can  proudly say has been in favour of their White Paper Merger proposals.\r\n\r\nSir, I do not want to go back and discuss once again the merits or otherwise  of\r\n\r\nclause  29,  but the Referendum Bill as it stands, particularly with clause  29,\r\n\r\nmeans  even  if  90 per cent of the people oppose the Government's  White  Paper\r\n\r\nMerger, the Government would bring about a result of the referendum on this\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmerger  issue  to  show  that  more than 90 per cent  support  the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals  and that, I think, is the fundamental position that every  Member  in\r\n\r\nthis House must recognise.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are so many provisions which, in our view, are completely\r\n\r\ninadequate  for this purpose, but the main provision is clause 29  and  we  have\r\n\r\nstated  this over and over in the Select Committee debate and the debate of  the\r\n\r\nwhole  Committee. I repeat what I said; it is possible that even if 90 per  cent\r\n\r\noppose  the Government's White Paper merger and if that 90 per cent is unwilling\r\n\r\nto choose between two alternatives, the Government would bring about a result to\r\n\r\nshow  that  more  than 90 per cent support the White Paper merger.  I  say.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, any man who suggests that this Bill with this certain provision is\r\n\r\nadequate,  is  a  reasonable  Bill, is a Bill which  will  provide  a  fair  and\r\n\r\nreasonable  machinery  for consulting the views of the people,  must  either  be\r\n\r\nlying or must be insane.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say with a clear conscience and a clear understanding of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthinking that the sole purpose of this Bill is to fix their political opponents,\r\n\r\nis  to ensure the continuity of P.A.P. political survival; and my answer to this\r\n\r\nis,  the political opponents of the P.A.P. are those in the Barisan Sosialis  or\r\n\r\nthe  Communists that are talked about so much by the P.A.P. leaders.  I  am  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  make  a statement. Sir, if it were a question of 300  odd  Communists\r\n\r\ngetting  into a zugzwang because of this Referendum Bill, then I  say  it  is  a\r\n\r\nwaste  of time having sat here and talked this Bill over day in and day out  for\r\n\r\nthe last week or so. This Bill, whatever the purpose of the Government, will fix\r\n\r\nthe  future  of  our  people without giving our people a fair  chance  to  state\r\n\r\nclearly, without ambiguity, whether they support the constitutional arrangements\r\n\r\nor not.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the responsibility of all of us in this House, whether we are in\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis, the Workers' Party, the United People's Party,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nS.P.A. or P.A.P., to make sure that we do not put a vote in support of  a  Bill\r\n\r\nthat  will  mean putting our people in a zugzwang, in the words of the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance.  It  is as simple as that. Sir, if they want to  fix  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  there  are  various means other than this Bill  to  fix  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  I do not have to suggest what they ought to do, but they know,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  it is not the 300 Communists, or whatever membership the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nhas, who would be involved in just voting; it means 624,000 people going to  the\r\n\r\npolls on a referendum on merger and saying whether they support the Government's\r\n\r\nWhite Paper proposals or whether they support any other proposal.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

We will come to that  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether it should be complete merger, whether it should be unconditional merger,\r\n\r\nor  whether  it  should  be merger on certain terms. As  far  as  this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  so long as clause 29 is there, even ignoring the other  undemocratic\r\n\r\nfeatures of the Bill, it means if a vast majority of the people, even if 90  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  the people, oppose the White Paper merger, the Government  will  bring\r\n\r\nabout a result to show more than 90 per cent support for the White Paper merger.\r\n\r\nAs  I said, if 90 per cent of our electorate are unwilling to choose between two\r\n\r\nunacceptable  alternatives and put in blank votes, five per cent  vote  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's White Paper merger, and five per cent vote for something else, then\r\n\r\nthe  ultimate result declared will be 95 per cent in support of the White  Paper\r\n\r\nmerger,  and this is something they cannot get away from.

The S.P.A. wants a merger\r\n\r\nreferendum and the S.P.A. therefore supports the Third Reading of the Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of the attacks of the Member for Anson and some other Members from\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis have been on the grounds that the Government had  claimed\r\n\r\nthat  this National Referendum Bill was a general Referendum Bill, and later  on\r\n\r\nit  became  a specific Referendum Bill, and still later on it became  a  general\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill. Sir, the Government could have carried on with this pretence of\r\n\r\na  general Referendum Bill had it not been for the opposition of the S.P.A. who\r\n\r\ninsisted that if they wanted to adopt certain provisions in the Bill to  contain\r\n\r\nthe  Communists and to frustrate any merger referendum, they would not have  met\r\n\r\nwith our strong opposition and so they made up their minds that the life of  the\r\n\r\nlaw would come\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nto  an end after the merger referendum. So, in one way, if one were to read  the\r\n\r\nBill over and over again after it had gone through a Committee of this Assembly,\r\n\r\nit  could still be maintained that it was a general Referendum Bill. But let  us\r\n\r\nnot  worry ourselves whether it is a general Referendum Bill or a specific  Bill\r\n\r\nfor  merger. The fact is that it will be a law brought in to see to  it  that  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  on merger is held under conditions that will be free from  Communist\r\n\r\nsubversive  activities. Sir, the questions are to be debated in  this  Assembly.\r\n\r\nNotice has already been given and I too have given notice of an amendment  which\r\n\r\nI  propose to move. All the attacks by the Members on my side of the House  have\r\n\r\nbeen  based on the belief that there would be two questions. Surely,  Sir,  when\r\n\r\nthe  motion is being discussed Members of the Opposition, even the Barisan,  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party,  the United People's Party, can put up their ideas  about  what\r\n\r\nquestions should be submitted for a referendum and have them fully debated here.\r\n\r\nThere  could be two, there could be three, there could be five. We do not  know,\r\n\r\nbecause we cannot anticipate the debate on the motion, nor can we foretell  what\r\n\r\nwould  be  the result of that debate. Sir, I have this to say of the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson.  His  vitriolic attack on this Bill is due to his lofty  ideals.  He  has\r\n\r\nlofty  ideals  and  he always maintains that he should fight  for  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy and is prepared even to lay down his life for parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\nBut  I would like to make this point to him and ask him to ponder whether it  is\r\n\r\nright  that  he  should put up this strong fight without thinking  of  what  may\r\n\r\nhappen.  What  is behind this clause 29? The Barisan Sosialis, of course,  speak\r\n\r\nvery strongly against clause 29 for obvious reasons. They want to frustrate  the\r\n\r\nmerger  referendum and they want to be given free rein to do it, but the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson is guided by different motives. He says it is democratic. I agree with\r\n\r\nhim it is democratic, but in as much as the P.P.S.O. was democratic, so is this.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Undemocratic!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Undemocratic.\r\n\r\nI am sorry.

And it was the Member for Anson, when he was Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  who introduced that undemocratic law and maintained it in this  House\r\n\r\nagainst  all opposition. Why did he do it? Because he said the security and  the\r\n\r\nwell-being of the people of Singapore must come first, the Labour Front second.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In as much as he was guided by that lofty ideal, may I say\r\n\r\nthis, that the interest of the people of Singapore must come first, the Workers'\r\n\r\nParty  second? And yet the Members of the Barisan Sosialis shout and  shout  and\r\n\r\nshout  against  this undemocratic provision of clause 29 in the Bill.  And  when\r\n\r\nthey,  the  13, who are now sitting behind me were sitting on that side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  they  were the people who were a party to increasing  the  life  of  the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O. from three years to five years. At that time they never thought it  was\r\n\r\nundemocratic,  because they were doing it, so what they did was right  and  what\r\n\r\nother  people  did  should be wrong. That should not be the  way  to  behave  as\r\n\r\nresponsible representatives of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been asked whether I would declare our stand, whether I would fight for\r\n\r\nan  undemocratic act.

This was what  the  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, the Member for Queenstown, had to say. He said:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As regards the referendum. I don't think it is suitable, because a referendum\r\n\r\nis something new in Malaya. As you know, the people are not very conversant with\r\n\r\nthe  democratic  process and it will take some time before people  will  realise\r\n\r\nwhat it is all about.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>This utterance by the Member for Queenstown betrays the real line of thinking of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis, namely, that right from the beginning, they were against a\r\n\r\nreferendum.  Therefore when we proposed this Bill, their line of action  was  to\r\n\r\noppose it and during the past few days, we have seen how they have tried to \r\n\r\nfilibuster, adopt delaying tactics, to prevent this Bill from being passed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what the Member for Queenstown has said reveals two important points.\r\n\r\nOne,  in  relation to the attitude of the Barisan Sesialis towards  the  people.\r\n\r\nTwo, what they have to say about clause 29. In effect, the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\ndisplayed absolute arrogance towards the people when he said that the people are\r\n\r\nnot very conversant with\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  democratic process and that it will take some time before they will realise\r\n\r\nwhat it is all about. When the Barisan Sosialis talk of preserving parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy and accuse the Government of breaking down\r\n\r\nthe  democratic  process, it is the Barisan Sosialis really who do  not  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the people are fitted for the democratic process. Assuming what the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown has said is true, that it will take some time before the  people\r\n\r\nwill  realise  what  it  is all about, then it is pretty obvious -  in  spite  of\r\n\r\nwhatever  explanations  the  Member for Queenstown and  his  colleagues  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis may care to offer about the referendum - that it  will  take  a\r\n\r\nvery  long  time  for the people to understand even what the referendum  is  all\r\n\r\nabout.  Under the circumstances, would it not be expected then that blank  votes\r\n\r\nwill  be  cast  if  the people do not understand the purpose of the  referendum?\r\n\r\nThere  is  a possibility indeed that blank votes will be cast. Surely, if  blank\r\n\r\nvotes  are  cast, then that would indicate that those who cast them  would  have\r\n\r\ndone so because they did not understand what the referendum was all about. It is\r\n\r\npretty obvious that we cannot allow people who do not understand what it is  all\r\n\r\nabout  to  decide  the destiny of 1.6 million people in Singapore.  We  are  the\r\n\r\nelected representatives and if those who cast blank votes do not understand what\r\n\r\nit  is  all about, it is right and proper that we in the Assembly should  decide\r\n\r\nthe  question  on their behalf. Therefore, clause 29 provides that  blank  votes\r\n\r\nwill  be decided by the Assembly. But as the Member for Cairnhill has said  just\r\n\r\nnow,  the Barisan Sosialis have a conspiracy to instigate the people and may  be\r\n\r\neven  to  intimidate the voters to cast blank votes. Under a  cloud  of  such  a\r\n\r\npossibility,  we cannot allow this conspiracy to succeed. Those who  cast  blank\r\n\r\nvotes cannot be allowed to decide our fate and our future. So we come back again\r\n\r\nto  clause  29  which  provides that such blank votes will  be  decided  by  the\r\n\r\nAssembly, by us who have been elected, by us who are here as legislators.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other objection which the Barisan Sosialis has raised is to clause 5 which\r\n\r\nrelates  to  the  type  of  question or questions  that  can  be  asked  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum.  During the debate in Committee on clause 5, the  Barisan  Sosialis,\r\n\r\nand even the Member for Anson, insisted that there should be a simple yes or  no\r\n\r\nanswer.  May  I  refer  the House again to what the spokesman  for  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis had\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto say in the radio forum? This is what he said:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In principle, all of us are agreed on merger.\r\n\r\nBut  how  is  that  question to be posed? If an elector should  agree  with  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of merger but disagrees with the details of merger, how is he going to\r\n\r\nvote yes or no?'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Precisely, Mr Speaker. It is ridiculous if in the referendum on merger  we  are\r\n\r\nto  ask the voter to vote yes or no. Because we understand the impossibility  of\r\n\r\nthe  position, this Bill provides that a question or questions can be  asked  in\r\n\r\nthe referendum. As Members in this House are now aware, a motion in the name  of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister has been tabled in which the nature of the questions  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  asked in the referendum on merger will be debated and the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill has also indicated that he will be moving an amendment to this motion.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, in this referendum for merger, since all of us have agreed  on\r\n\r\nthe principle of merger, what is now necessary is to ask the electorate the mode\r\n\r\nand  manner  in  which reunification with the Federation will take place - whether\r\n\r\nthey want merger or closer relationship along the lines of Command Paper No.  33\r\n\r\nwith autonomy in education and labour; whether they want complete merger, or whe\r\n\r\nther  they want merger as proposed by the Member for Cairnhill. So, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  what I sought to do was to prove to this House the insincerity and \"humbuggery\" of the Barisan Sosiahs.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Humbugging?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Right from the beginning they have never been in favour\r\n\r\na  referendum, because in their arrogance they do not believe that  the  people\r\n\r\nare  ready for the democratic process; and to hammer it down the throats of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis again, let me repeat what their Chairman said, \"The people  are\r\n\r\nnot  very  conversant  with the democratic process and it will  take  some  time\r\n\r\nbefore  the  people will realise what it is all about.\" These are the  so-called\r\n\r\nchampions  of  parliamentary democracy, when at the same time they  despise  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, all the dust that has been raised by the Barisan Sosialis over clause 5 and clause 29 on the question of the blank votes is just to confuse the\r\n\r\nissue-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Surely, Mr, speaker, Sir, when a\r\n\r\nsubject matter is sent for a referendum, the answer must be either this  way  or\r\n\r\nthat way, and people who cannot decide must not be allowed to use their votes to\r\n\r\nbe weighted in favour of the Government.

The first contradiction I have  just\r\n\r\nmentioned.  The  second  contradiction is that  he  has  ridiculed  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  [Interruption.] I am very tempted to reply, Mr Speaker, Sir,  but  I\r\n\r\ntry  very  hard  to look at you. The Deputy Prime Minister contradicted  himself\r\n\r\nwhen  he  tried to put up a facade that he believed that the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwere  ripe for democracy and that the Barisan Sosialis did not believe that they\r\n\r\nwere  ripe for democracy. The first part of his contention may be true, but  the\r\n\r\nsecond  part is certainly not true. The Barisan Sosialis believe that the people\r\n\r\nare  ripe for democracy, but in the presence of legal rigging by the Government,\r\n\r\ndemocracy\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntakes  on  added meaning and such democracy, I am sure, the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncannot  understand. So, on the one hand, he says that the Singapore  people  are\r\n\r\nripe for democracy, and yet, on the other hand, he justifies his stand that they\r\n\r\nare  not ripe for democracy by saying that when they cast blank votes, they  are\r\n\r\nall  confused and know nothing about democracy. If in this referendum more  than\r\n\r\nhalf  the  people of Singapore actually cast blank votes, then the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister must swallow his words. Of course, under the legal provisions  of  this\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill, it is not possible for us to know how many  per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  have  actually cast blank votes because the Government have taken  great\r\n\r\ncare  to  hide  that figure and because the Government know that  if  ever  that\r\n\r\nfigure  became  known,  the  mock  democracy the  Government  practise  will  be\r\n\r\ncompletely exposed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister asks, why all the dust kicked up over this Bill? He answers it himself; that it is because the Barisan Sosialis want to confuse the\r\n\r\npeople. But have the Barisan Sosialis the apparatus to confuse the people?  Have\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis control of Radio Singapore and their Radio P.A.P.? Have the\r\n\r\nOpposition control of the Press, the Ministry of Culture vans?

You  see, if clause 29 is put to the electorate, and if only one  simple\r\n\r\nquestion is posed, I am sure there would not be any blank votes because there is\r\n\r\nno confusion.

Clause 29, being such an important clause, I am sure, is\r\n\r\nworth  the $400,000, that is the cost of a referendum. He further said, \"Let  us\r\n\r\ncontrast  the attitude of the Government with the attitude of the Opposition  on\r\n\r\nthe  Referendum  Bill.\" He went on to say that in so far as  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the Government believes that the issue of merger must be  submitted\r\n\r\nto  the people for a definite decision. Of course, the Government tosses a  coin\r\n\r\non the table and tells us, \"Heads, I win;\r\n\r\ntails,  you  lose.  Let's  bet.\" What kind of a bet can  there  be,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, when the coin turns out to be heads on both sides?

We in the Opposition  Parties  have\r\n\r\npointed  out many of the undemocratic provisions in the Bill. We have  moved\r\n\r\nmany  amendments  to these undemocratic provisions without success.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment want to pose a question of national importance to the people for\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntheir decision, it should be done in a democratic and fair manner. Our object in\r\n\r\nmoving  the  amendments  is  to  ask  the Government  to  conduct  the  national\r\n\r\nreferendum  in  a  fair, reasonable and democratic way. But the Government  have\r\n\r\nrejected all our amendments.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to the National Referendum Bill, the\r\n\r\nMinisters  and their Parliamentary Secretaries stressed in the Select  Committee\r\n\r\nthat this Bill is a general referendum Bill. At the same time, they pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  this Bill may be used to ascertain the views of the people on the question\r\n\r\nof smoking or the hours for the sale of toddy.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these examples cited by the Government cannot convince us. Therefore, when\r\n\r\nthe  Second  Reading of this Bill was debated in this House, the Ministers  also\r\n\r\nsaid  that this Bill was a general Referendum Bill. But when we sought to  amend\r\n\r\nthe  undemocratic  provisions,  the  Government  could  not  advance  reasonable\r\n\r\narguments to rebut us, and so they had to change their stand by saying that this\r\n\r\nBill  was  a specific one to hold a referendum on the merger issue. Our Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home Affairs then suggested that when the national referendum on the merger\r\n\r\nquestion  has  been  held, this Bill will be repealed. From their  contradictory\r\n\r\nstatements  and  their  inconsistent arguments,  we  can  be  certain  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is not sincere in moving this Bill. The Government will not ascertain\r\n\r\nthe  views  of the people in a democratic manner. The introduction of this  Bill\r\n\r\nwas motivated by their personal selfish interests.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we the Barisan Sosialis have stressed time and again\r\n\r\nthat  the people must be consulted on any question of national importance.  Then\r\n\r\nthe  Government  must sincerely put forward the question to be  decided  by  the\r\n\r\npeople in a fair and democratic way. But they dare not do so. Therefore, we feel\r\n\r\nthat this National Referendum Bill cannot ascertain the wishes and views of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. We therefore oppose its Third Reading.

The  Government  have  no\r\n\r\nintention, of ascertaining the will and wishes of the people through democratic\r\n\r\nmeans.  That is why we on the Opposition side are strongly opposed  to  it,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is why some societies and organisations have protested vigorously.

Therefore, we feel  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  have not considered carefully the opinions  of  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties  of  this  House; neither have they considered  the  opinions  of  other\r\n\r\npeople.  They have insisted on carrying out the undemocratic provisions of  this\r\n\r\nBill. On the grounds of interest and welfare of the people, we vigorously oppose\r\n\r\nthe passing of the Third Reading of this Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has said that when the people of Singapore could not make a decision as a result of which they cast blank votes, then such blank\r\n\r\nvotes  should  be  taken  as in favour of the Government.  This  shows  his  low\r\n\r\nestimation of the political knowledge of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore actually know everything about this. The Government\r\n\r\ncan  look  after the welfare of the people of Singapore. The people of Singapore\r\n\r\nare  capable  of making their own decision. They are capable of voting  for  the\r\n\r\nParty  which seeks their welfare and interest. Therefore, when the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister says that the people of Singapore, when they could not make a decision,\r\n\r\nwould cast blank votes, I say that he is not correct.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member for Toa Payoh, like every other Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nMember, is always referring to the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister says that\r\n\r\na blank ballot paper would be in support of the Government's question.

The Deputy Prime Minister  never  said\r\n\r\nthat.  He  said that a blank vote cast was a vote cast in favour of the decision\r\n\r\nof  the Legislative Assembly.

We have just heard the Deputy Prime Minister saying  that  we  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis would confuse the people during the national referendum, but if\r\n\r\nthere is such confusion, it is not because of the Barisan Sosialis. In the  past\r\n\r\nwe  have heard the Prime Minister over the radio on national citizenship and  so\r\n\r\non.  This confused the people as regards the terms \"national\" and \"citizen\". Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, according to our views on this Bill, we feel that it is  most  undemocratic  that  the  P.A.P. should pass it  just  in  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nMinisters.

The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown  also, Sir, not in this Chamber but in  the  C.P.A.

I  am\r\n\r\nglad  to  know  that  chivalry still exists and I am indebted  to  him  for  the\r\n\r\nchivalry and consideration that he has accorded to a lady Member of this  House.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sir, I would like to state that I do not need to be spared. In fact,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  understand why it is so difficult for the Member for Queenstown, or  any\r\n\r\nMember  of  the Barisan Sosialis, to understand why I and my colleagues  in  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. have condemned the Bill outside but are now supporting it here. Can  they\r\n\r\nnot  see the reason? Can they not see the difference of the Referendum Bill then\r\n\r\nand the Referendum Bill today in these circumstances?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at that time we were against the Bill because we felt that clause 29 was\r\n\r\na  clause which would force the people, as the Member for Anson said, to  choose\r\n\r\nbetween  beating your wife or beating your daughter. It was true then, Sir,  but\r\n\r\nnow since our leader, the Member for Cairnhill, has suggested \r\n\r\n- and  it  has  been  accepted by the Government - that the  questions  should  he\r\n\r\ndiscussed  and debated here and each political Party should be allowed  to  pose\r\n\r\nthe  question  that they want to pose and present the type of merger  that  they\r\n\r\nwant, where would there be the necessity to cast blank votes then?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir, I am indeed indebted to the Lady.\r\n\r\nIs  the  Lady from Mountbatten satisfied?

Parliamentary  democracy  deems  us  to  be  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the majority of the people. Laws are passed here  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen accepted by the people outside. In the case of merger, it is true there has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  certain amount of doubt as to the type of merger the people  want,  and\r\n\r\nthis House has agreed that there should be a referendum. Sir, in this House none\r\n\r\nof  us have ever said we do not want merger, and the referendum is only to  find\r\n\r\nout  what  type of merger we want. If we, the people in this House, are supposed\r\n\r\nto  be  the  representatives of the majority, and each Party has  presented  its\r\n\r\nviews  on  the type of merger and the type of questions they want to  be  posed,\r\n\r\nthen  surely we can expect the electorate to choose one of them. Supposing, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  spite  of  all  these questions posed by all the political Parties  here,  a\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the electorate say, \"We do not want all of them.\" What  does  that\r\n\r\nmean? It can only mean one of two things; that there has been an effort to wreck\r\n\r\nthe  referendum in order to obstruct merger, or something has gone so very wrong\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. supporters are rejecting their P.A.P. representatives here,  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. supporters  are rejecting the S.P.A. representatives here,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis supporters are rejecting the Barisan Sosialis representatives here, and\r\n\r\nsoon  with all the others. Now, I am sure it would be ridiculous to assume  that\r\n\r\notherwise\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwhat  else  can  it be, if all of us have posed all our questions  and  all  the\r\n\r\nquestions are rejected? That means nobody in Singapore wants any of us  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, which I think would be a ridiculous thing to assume. Therefore, if  inspite  of  the  fact that all the questions of the different Parties  have  been\r\n\r\nposed,  the  majority of them still put in blank votes, then there may  be  some\r\n\r\ntruth  in the Government's claim that there has been an effort by the Communists\r\n\r\nto  wreck the referendum. After all, Sir, we must give credit to this fact, that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.,  the  Party  in power, has had a lot of experience,  having  worked\r\n\r\ntogether  with the Communists - I would even say corroborated with them, protected\r\n\r\nthem  and advised them, and have been put into power by them. We must admit that\r\n\r\nthey  do  know a lot more about the Communist tactics than we do, and we  cannot\r\n\r\njust  dismiss that claim of theirs that it is the Communist tactic to wreck  the\r\n\r\nreferendum, and if clause 29 is not in, the Communists will succeed.  We  cannot\r\n\r\ndismiss  this threat, Sir, without a certain amount of risk. Therefore, I  think\r\n\r\nthe leader of the S.P.A. has done very well because, instead of taking that risk\r\n\r\nand  saying, \"No, we insist that clause 29 be out,\" instead of taking  the  risk\r\n\r\nthat  there may be some truth in the Government's claim, he has very efficiently\r\n\r\nand effectively handled the situation so that you get the same effect without  a\r\n\r\nrisk. The effect is that clause 29 no longer means that the people will have  to\r\n\r\nchoose between two undesirable things, that they will have the question of their\r\n\r\nown representatives in this House posed to them. Is it reasonable then to expect\r\n\r\nthat they should vote for one of them?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Sir, is the change of the situation that has made us vote for\r\n\r\nthe  Third Reading rather than oppose it which we thought we were going  to  do,\r\n\r\nSir.  When  I  spoke, I meant every word that I said. In all  honesty  and  with\r\n\r\nsincerity,  I meant to come and vote against and speak against. But in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe change in the situation, we felt that it is wiser\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  take  the  step that we have taken. Moreover, Sir, as I have  said,  in  the\r\n\r\nexcitement and anxiety of the different Members of this House - some to see merger\r\n\r\nthrough; others to block merger \r\n\r\n- a  very  important point has been dealt with very lightly and it has  not  been\r\n\r\ngiven sufficient emphasis.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Justice.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I refer to the Bill, Sir, if it was to be used at all\r\n\r\ntimes under all conditions, on all national issues, in the way that it was  when\r\n\r\nI  spoke at a forum, not with the special conditions that have been agreed to by\r\n\r\nthe Government today. At that time, under those conditions, I said that there is\r\n\r\nno  guarantee that if it is a general referendum Bill in the next referendum the\r\n\r\nGovernment is going to allow the Assembly to discuss and debate the questions or\r\n\r\npose  the  questions. The conditions will be worse still if the next  Government\r\n\r\nhappens  to  be a pro-Communist Government. Can you see the danger of  this - what\r\n\r\nour General Secretary calls a lethal weapon in the hands of the Government to be\r\n\r\nused  as they wish, when they wish and for whatever they wish? Personally I  was\r\n\r\nagainst the Bill because it was going to be a general referendum Bill, at  least\r\n\r\nfor  merger,  even  without the special conditions,  Sir.  Although  we  do  not\r\n\r\nadvocate  undemocratic  measures, we can be consoled by  the  fact  that  if  it\r\n\r\nresults  in  the proposals set out in Command Paper No. 33 - whatever the  Barisan\r\n\r\nthought  about  Command  Paper No. 33, the Member for  Anson  admitted  that  he\r\n\r\nrespected  this  view  of the S.P.A. - it will be the first  step  towards  closer\r\n\r\nrelations. Now, if the Member for Anson respects that, then in spite of all  the\r\n\r\nundemocratic  terms  of  the  Referendum Bill, if it  leads  to  prosperity  for\r\n\r\nSingapore in closer relation with the Federation, at least we can be consoled by\r\n\r\nthat thought. As I said, Sir, although we do not advocate it, we can be consoled\r\n\r\nif  it  must  be so. But today we have sought means and ways to take the  undemocratic sting out of clause 29. Now\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthat  the  Bill is not going to be a general referendum Bill, we are  supporting\r\n\r\nthe  Third  Reading  because we feel that we have won the  day.  We  wanted  the\r\n\r\nquestions to be posed here and to be debated here. We have got\r\n\r\nit.   We wanted the Bill to be only on merger and not a general Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\nWe have got it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, talking about the questions being debated here, it has been the desire of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis - they have been clamouring for it for a long time - that this\r\n\r\nshould  be done. But with all their clamouring, shouting, scolding, abusing  and\r\n\r\nthe washing of dirty linen here, they have not achieved\r\n\r\nit.   It  was  because  the Member for Cairnhill at a radio forum  claimed  that\r\n\r\nclause  29  was undemocratic and also because of the way he handled  the  matter\r\n\r\nhere  that  the  Government have been forced to agree to  the  questions  to  be\r\n\r\ndebated here.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The P.A.P. have refused\r\n\r\nthis Joint Action Council to hold meetings in protest against this Bill. We know\r\n\r\nthat  even  inside the P.A.P. itself the few leaders have adopted a monopolising\r\n\r\nattitude and they do not accept the opinions of executive members and members of\r\n\r\nthe  Party.  That  is  why  today they have only 25 seats  in  this  House.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, the Member for Bras Basah recently resigned and crossed the  Floor  to\r\n\r\nsit on this side of the House because she objects to clause 29 of this Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy</b> rose and then resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary, of course, anticipated the Speaker\r\n\r\nwho  was  rather busy.

I will now touch  on  the  main\r\n\r\ntopic.  As  a result of the debate in the last few days, we can have  access  to\r\n\r\ncertain  secrets  of the P.A.P. in relation to this Bill. Let  me  quote  a  few\r\n\r\nexamples. For instance, this Bill has been said to be a general Referendum Bill,\r\n\r\nbut  later  on  it  becomes a specific Referendum Bill. It is  intended  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that after the holding of the referendum the Bill will be  repealed.\r\n\r\nIt  would appear, therefore, that the P.A.P. is not honest and is not consistent\r\n\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the P.A.P. has no confidence in its White Paper on\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmerger. That is why it will pose two questions to let the people choose, because\r\n\r\nthey know that the people will not support them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the P.A.P. has recognised that the people are not\r\n\r\nsatisfied with certain provisions of the Bill. That is why they are adopting the\r\n\r\npresent tactics.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is this. The provision in relation to the limitation of the\r\n\r\npublicity campaign; we can see that the P.A.P. is afraid of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\ncarrying out a publicity campaign, thus disclosing the dictatorial manner of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to the people. They want to curb us. As a representative of the people, I\r\n\r\nhave the duty to air my opinion here, that the National Referendum Bill of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P is not a democratic one, because its purpose is to enable the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nadulterate the views of the people. Because the provisions of the Bill are\r\n\r\nundemocratic and unreasonable, I support the amendment moved by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson, and we should refuse to let the Assembly have the Third Reading of this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, in the course of the debate in the past few days on the\r\n\r\nNational Referendum Bill, the Bill has passed the Committee stage. Now, let us\r\n\r\nexamine the details of this National Referendum Bill and let us ask whether we\r\n\r\nshould give it a Third Reading. The P.A.P. in bringing up this National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill want to prevent the people from opposing their merger proposals.\r\n\r\nMany unreasonable clauses have been written into the Bill with the support of\r\n\r\nthe reactionary political forces which survive up till today. Although\r\n\r\nunreasonable clauses have been incorporated into the Bill, this Bill looks like\r\n\r\nthis - that is, the Government has let loose a tiger embodied in this Bill to harm\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore. You can see, Mr Speaker, that the clause in relation\r\n\r\nto blank votes and uncertain votes is unprecedented in the history of the world,\r\n\r\nbut it has been incorporated into the Bill. It is put in with the purpose of\r\n\r\ndeceiving the people of Singapore, so as to carry on with-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have to mention that the Member for Moulmein is the eleventh\r\n\r\nspeaker  from  the Barisan Sosialis and he seems to be repeating  the  arguments\r\n\r\nwhich have been advanced by the other ten speakers. I would suggest to him  that\r\n\r\nthis  repetition is now becoming a bit tedious. The Speaker has this power under\r\n\r\nStanding Order 54 - If a Member persists in tedious repetition either of  his  own\r\n\r\narguments  or  arguments used by other Members in the debate,  the  Speaker  may\r\n\r\ndirect  that he discontinue his speech. So I would ask the Member not to  repeat\r\n\r\nwhat his fellow Members have said.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, this National Referendum Bill has passed the Committee  stage\r\n\r\nwith  all the unreasonable clauses incorporated into it, and my colleagues  have\r\n\r\nexplained very clearly how these clauses are unreasonable and undemocratic.  Let\r\n\r\nme  quote to you the Sixth Anniversary Celebration Souvenir of the P.A.P., 1960.\r\n\r\nThe  title of the article is \"Nation Building and Socialism\", Written by Dr Toh\r\n\r\nChin Chye, on page 50 [Mandarin version]:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A government rules by the consent of the people, it is a first axiom in\r\n\r\npolitics.  This of course implies that the government must not be divorced  from\r\n\r\nmass  thinking and mass aspirations. However, keeping in touch with  the  people\r\n\r\nmust take an active form by mass participation and co-operation in the plans and\r\n\r\nadministration of the government.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from here we can see what they said before, but the provisions in the National Referendum Bill are used to preserve their party\r\n\r\nprestige.

The difference in\r\n\r\ntreatment of woman officers is historical. It began in pre-war days when few\r\n\r\nbranches of the civil service had woman officers. Only in the teaching service\r\n\r\nwere women employed in great numbers compared to men but were paid four-fifths\r\n\r\nof the men's rate. In fact, with very few exceptions, the woman officers in the\r\n\r\ncivil service receive roughly 80 per cent of the pay of their male colleagues.\r\n\r\nAs for the conditions of service, they are also less advantageous. Woman\r\n\r\nofficers lose their permanent status when they marry, for then they are required\r\n\r\nto resign and are re-employed on a temporary basis. They therefore lose their\r\n\r\npension rights when they reach retiring age. They are also required to retire at\r\n\r\n45 years but are not allowed to serve up to the normal retiring age which was,\r\n\r\nuntil recently, 55 years. This policy of discrimination against women has no\r\n\r\nplace in a just society. The P.A.P. announced in the 1959 general election that\r\n\r\nit would observe the equality of status for women in our society so far as this\r\n\r\nis possible. This pledge has now been fulfilled in respect of woman officers in\r\n\r\nthe civil service.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it will not be possible to rectify the anomalies overnight. They will\r\n\r\nhave to be brought about by stages and by January 1965, all woman officers in\r\n\r\nthe civil service will be paid the same salary for the same type of work as men\r\n\r\nofficers. Administrative measures have been taken to carry out this policy. It\r\n\r\nis also necessary to amend the relevant sections of the Pensions Ordinance to\r\n\r\ngive effect to equal terms of employment to woman officers. Woman officers\r\n\r\nappointed to the service on or after 1st March, 1962, will no longer be\r\n\r\nrequired to resign or to retire on marriage. They will remain permanent officers\r\n\r\nand be allowed to serve up to the same retiring age as men. It is, however,\r\n\r\nnecessary to make provision\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  woman officers in the service prior to 1st March, 1962, can opt to  retire\r\n\r\nat  the existing age of retirement or to retire on marriage to qualify for  gratuity.  The opportunity is also taken to implement the decision to allow  Gurkhas\r\n\r\nserving  in  the Gurkha Contingent in the Singapore Police Force to retire  with\r\n\r\nfull pension benefits on or after completing 15 years of service, as it has been\r\n\r\nascertained that the average span of service of a Gurkha soldier in the  British\r\n\r\nArmy is 15 years.

This amendment  is  to  enable\r\n\r\npensions and other allowances to be paid to women who are already in the service\r\n\r\nbut  who opt to remain on the present terms. Put it this way: women officers who\r\n\r\nare engaged on or after the 1st of March, 1962, are employed on exactly the same\r\n\r\nterms  as men, that is to say, even if they are married, they still retain their\r\n\r\npensionable  status. It does not affect them at all. And they cannot  retire  at\r\n\r\nthe age of 45. They have not got the option of retiring at that age.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if they were employed before that date, they have certain privileges\r\n\r\nwhich they may want to retain. For instance, if they marry and if they have  put\r\n\r\nin 10 years of service, section 17 of the Pensions Ordinance entitles them to  a\r\n\r\nmarriage  gratuity of one month per year of service. This section  is  to  allow\r\n\r\nsuch women who want to retain these rights that they have. On the other hand, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  they  may  want  to opt into the new terms, and they  are  particularly\r\n\r\nentitled to do so, which means that they will retain their pensionable\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nstatus  after  marriage, at a price, of course, of foregoing these  benefits  of\r\n\r\nmarriage gratuities.

Which does it mean?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> This is all very confusing.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can the Minister answer that at this time of the night?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It means that she has opted to retire but has not retired.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the question which the hon. Member wants to ask really is this: in the\r\n\r\ncase of women who have already retired, what are their pension rights? Now, with\r\n\r\nthis  amendment, when all women who take advantage of this option of a  complete\r\n\r\nequality with men \r\n\r\n- whether they marry or do not get married - retire, they get full pension  rights.\r\n\r\nFormerly, that was not the case. A married woman loses her pensionable status on\r\n\r\nmarriage,  and if she has served for say 10 to 15 years, she draws an  allowance\r\n\r\nof  half  the full pension rights. And if she has completed more than 15  years,\r\n\r\nshe gets 60 per cent of full pension rights. These quantums are regulated not by\r\n\r\nthis  Ordinance  but  by  regulations. Regulation 22 sets  down  the  allowances\r\n\r\npayable to persons in non-pensionable establishment - both men and women who  have\r\n\r\nretired  after so many years of service. Therefore, the eligibility to  pensions\r\n\r\nof  women  officers  who have already retired remains as  before,  and  is  not\r\n\r\naffected  by this Ordinance. If we want to give them the pensions to which  they\r\n\r\nwould  have  been entitled if this policy had been in force in  the  past,  then\r\n\r\namendments to these regulations made under the Pensions\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nOrdinance would be necessary. Whether or not there is a case for doing so is  an\r\n\r\nextremely  complicated matter. There are arguments for and against. The  obvious\r\n\r\nargument  is that women officers who retired before 1st March, 1962,  are  in  a\r\n\r\nsense  done out of something. Supposing she retires on 28th February,  then  she\r\n\r\nwould have lost certain rights. Therefore, it could be said that there is a case\r\n\r\nfor  giving  such  women full pension entitlement. But there are  many  horrible\r\n\r\ncomplications.  I  have gone through these in some detail.  For  instance,  some\r\n\r\nwomen  draw  pensions  in  respect of services both  in  Singapore  and  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Then what do we do about that? Then certain women have drawn  their\r\n\r\npensions  in the form of capital grants; others have not. Although  I  have  not\r\n\r\nmade  up  my mind finally on this subject, it does seem to me that the case  for\r\n\r\npreserving  the  status quo is rather stronger than the case for making  further\r\n\r\nchanges to the regulations made under the Pensions Ordinance.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in dealing with women, of course, there\r\n\r\nwill  be a lot of complications.

There is the other complication which I would  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister to explain - if it is a complication.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens to a female officer in the service before the operative date? She\r\n\r\ngot  married, she got her marriage allowance, but can she now apply to be on the\r\n\r\npensionable  status, after having taken the marriage allowance?  Would  it  also\r\n\r\nmean that she would have her marriage allowance deducted from her pensions?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, she can apply for transfer into the permanent\r\n\r\nservice  in the usual way.

Such  women\r\n\r\ncan  apply  for  admission into the permanent service.  And  if  their  original\r\n\r\nappointment  had been made by the Public Service Commission, then  the  transfer\r\n\r\nwould be automatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs  regards pension rights, the service in respect of which marriage  allowance\r\n\r\nhad  been  drawn, would not naturally count as pensionable service.

There is a maximum to the gratuity. But if\r\n\r\nthat 9\ufffd years is given to her and counted in her years of service, then when the\r\n\r\npensions  are  calculated, it would mean much more to her than  the  one  year's\r\n\r\nsalary  which  she  has  received as gratuity. Can she return  that  one  year's\r\n\r\nservice and claim pensions from the day that she was originally appointed, which\r\n\r\nwould mean that in her old age she would have a bigger pension to live on?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That is why I say, never deal with women.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There are two reasons.

It is felt that  these\r\n\r\nprovisions will enable a more effective control to be exercised over the keeping\r\n\r\nof clients' money by advocates and solicitors. The proposed section 41B provides\r\n\r\nfor  the  maintenance  and  administration of  a  compensation  fund  to  enable\r\n\r\ncompensation  to be paid where any person has sustained loss in  consequence  of\r\n\r\nthe dishonesty of any advocate or solicitor or any clerk or servant employed  by\r\n\r\nhim  in  connection with his practice. Failure to comply with the rules relating\r\n\r\nto  the  keeping of accounts will constitute a disciplinary offence for which  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint  can  he  made to the Bar Committee, and it is also  provided  that  a\r\n\r\ncertificate  to practise will not be issued to an advocate and solicitor  unless\r\n\r\nhe  satisfies the Registrar that he has complied with the provisions relating to\r\n\r\nthe keeping of accounts and the delivery of an accountant's certificate.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power is given to the State Advocate-General to refer any information touching\r\n\r\non the conduct of a solicitor in his professional capacity to the Bar Committee.\r\n\r\nThat is provided for in clause 7.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent abuses, it is proposed that a solicitor will not be allowed to make an agreement with his client for the payment of a commission,\r\n\r\npercentage or salary to him.

It is  provided\r\n\r\nthat no solicitor shall, without the consent of the court, employ any person who\r\n\r\nhas  been  struck  off the roll, or suspended from practice,  or  who  has  been\r\n\r\nconvicted of an offence involving dishonesty  of touting or of holding himself\r\n\r\nout to be a qualified person or who has been listed as a tout or who\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nis  a  public  servant. The purpose of this amendment is to remove all  opportunities  for touting and to ensure that only persons of integrity will be employed\r\n\r\nin  the  offices of advocates and solicitors. It is, however, intended to permit\r\n\r\nthe  employment of advocates and solicitors and qualified persons even  if  they\r\n\r\nhad  previously been in Government service. I will move an amendment at the  Committee stage of the Bill to make this intention clear.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is made for the ad hoc admission of Queen's Counsel to appear in\r\n\r\ncases  in  Singapore. I shall be moving an amendment to this clause  to  provide\r\n\r\nthat  such  Queen's Counsel may only be admitted by the court for  one  or  more\r\n\r\nspecial  reasons  in  the  public interest and that such  Queen's  Counsel  have\r\n\r\nspecial qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case for which  they\r\n\r\nare to be admitted. Before admitting such persons, the court will have regard to\r\n\r\nthe views of the State Advocate-General and the Bar Committee.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present position in Singapore is that Queen's Counsel can be admitted\r\n\r\nto  the Singapore Bar without much formality, and the practice has been that  no\r\n\r\nopposition  is  raised  by the Singapore Bar Committee or  the  State  Advocate-General.  In the Federation of Malaya, however, statutory provisions  have  been\r\n\r\nstrictly enforced, and in a recent case, the Chief Justice of the Federation has\r\n\r\ndecided  that  the  provisions  of section 7 of  the  Federation  Advocates  and\r\n\r\nSolicitors  Ordinance, 1947, must be complied with. This requires,  inter  alia,\r\n\r\nthat the person applying to be admitted must satisfy the Board appointed by  the\r\n\r\nBar  Council  that he has an adequate knowledge of the laws of  the  Federation.\r\n\r\nThere is no corresponding provision requiring knowledge of the laws of Singapore\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  All  that is required in Singapore is that the  persons  seeking\r\n\r\nadmission  should satisfy the examiners that they have an adequate knowledge  of\r\n\r\nthe  practice  and  etiquette of the profession and  of  the  English  language.\r\n\r\nQueen's  Counsel, therefore, have had no difficulty in satisfying the examiners.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe Federation there have been no applications other than the one which recently\r\n\r\ncame  before  the  Chief Justice made by a non-resident practitioner,  while  in\r\n\r\nSingapore there has been a number of such admissions.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal for ad hoc admissions will restrict the admission of non-resident\r\n\r\npractitioners, as  Queen's  Counsel will  only  be  admitted  to  appear  in  a\r\n\r\nparticular case. It is proposed to restrict the right still further by requiring\r\n\r\nthe Queen's Counsel seeking admission to show that he has special qualifications\r\n\r\nand  experience  for the purpose of the case.

The members of the Bar are conscious that they carry special  responsibilities  to  the community they serve. I know that there has been  considerable\r\n\r\nanxiety, Mr Speaker, caused amongst members of the Bar of Singapore as a result\r\n\r\nof the widely publicized occasion when a member of the Bar committed a breach of\r\n\r\ntrust  of  vast sums of money. The extent of the defalcations and the repute  of\r\n\r\nthe advocate and solicitor concerned brought home with a shock to all in the Bar\r\n\r\nthe possibility that this incident or similar incidents may recur. And it is  in\r\n\r\nthese  circumstances that the Bar has been very anxious to create a compensation\r\n\r\nfund  to  which  the  Bar  itself would contribute whereby  clients  who  suffer\r\n\r\npecuniary loss from the misconduct of a member of the Bar may be compensated out\r\n\r\nof  a fund for which all members of the Bar would be equally responsible. And in\r\n\r\nconformity with the high traditions of its profession, the Singapore  Bar  seeks\r\n\r\nto  implement the concept, Sir, that all members should be responsible  for  the\r\n\r\npecuniary loss arising from the professional misconduct of any\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\none  member, in order to protect the community in its trust of this professional\r\n\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed section 41D, which creates the compensation fund, is the first\r\n\r\neffort  in  this  part of the world to implement the concept  of  the  pecuniary\r\n\r\nresponsibility of a group of professional men for the misconduct of one of  themselves.  This clause is only part of the answer to the problem. It is  my  hope,\r\n\r\nand  I  believe the hope of many members of the Bar, that as soon  as  the  fund\r\n\r\ngrows in strength, amending legislation will be introduced to enable clients who\r\n\r\nsuffer  pecuniary loss from criminal misconduct of solicitors to claim from  the\r\n\r\nfund  the  full loss and not merely to receive an ex-gratia grant.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to see in due course this fund becoming the insurer for all pecuniary  loss  arising  not  only from criminal misconduct  but  also  from  the\r\n\r\nnegligence of a member of the Bar. When this is achieved, the Bar will have made\r\n\r\nadequate  provisions to meet to the full its responsibilities commensurate  with\r\n\r\nthe privileges which it enjoys.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that this is not at present possible and will not be possible for\r\n\r\nsome time until the fund is of adequate size. It is my hope that the aim will be\r\n\r\nkept  in  sight  and  that the Bar, as a whole, must carry the  full  burden  of\r\n\r\npecuniary loss arising out of negligence or misconduct of its individual members\r\n\r\nin order to maintain and enhance the trust and respect of the community.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation fund will be of particular assistance to many young men now\r\n\r\ncoming into the profession whose background is not publicly known, and whom  the\r\n\r\npublic  will  be  the readier to trust if they know that should their  trust  be\r\n\r\nmisplaced  they  can always seek redress from the compensation fund.  It  is  my\r\n\r\nhope,  Sir,  that though the younger members of the Bar are the  ones  who  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  most by this provision, nevertheless the Bar Committee will see  to  it\r\n\r\nthat  there will be differential payments to the compensation fund in  order  to\r\n\r\nassist junior members of the Bar in\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntheir first few years when they may be unable to meet the full normal quota that\r\n\r\nis expected of all of us.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say, Sir, that I welcome the provisions for compulsory\r\n\r\nand  exhaustive accounting by solicitors. Sir, it is a curious thing  that  many\r\n\r\nmembers of the Bar, in common with most members of the public, loathe accounts.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What about\r\n\r\naccountants?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Many have but a sketchy idea of accounting. It is true that, this\r\n\r\nwill  help  accountants. But I am certain that the Government did not introduce\r\n\r\nthese  provisions to help the accountants. But these provisions, and I refer  to\r\n\r\nsections  41A and 41B, are good in that they compel exhaustive accounting  under\r\n\r\nthe  supervision of professional accountants to avoid any possibility not merely\r\n\r\nof  conscious  fraud,  Sir, which is very rare, but of innocent  mishandling  of\r\n\r\nclients'  funds. I know that it would mean a certain expense to the  member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bar and bear heavily again on the younger members who have recently  joined\r\n\r\nthe  profession  and who practise on their own. This additional  burden  can  be\r\n\r\nheavy for this small group, but for the welfare of the profession as a whole  it\r\n\r\nseems  to me that the provisions of sections 41A and 41B are essential  and  the\r\n\r\nsmall  group of junior advocates and solicitors who are practising on their  own\r\n\r\nmust carry the additional burden.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am particularly delighted with the action of the Government in adverting to views expressed in respect of section 7A, the clause whereby Queen's\r\n\r\nCounsel  are  permitted to come to Singapore' specifically for one case.  As  it\r\n\r\noriginally stood, Sir, that clause would have permitted Queen's Counsel to  come\r\n\r\nat  will and pleasure. Very fortunately Sir, and I would like to say this; that\r\n\r\nit is not a matter of professional jealousy cm the part of the Bar, but it is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of reoognising that if the members of the Bar in Singapore are  deprived\r\n\r\nof  the  opportunity of handling important cases, such deprivation can  have  an\r\n\r\neffect on their own efficiency.

I think it is important to read  it  and\r\n\r\nto  recognise the good sense the Government showed in giving weight to the  view\r\n\r\nexpressed by the Chief Justice of the Federation and in seeking to amend  their\r\n\r\nprovisions to conform with a view which clarified the position.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am reading from the Straits Times of the 5th of April, 1962 and the\r\n\r\nheading  is: THE CHIEF JUSTICE ON 'OUTSIDE COMPETITTON'. It is dated from  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur and it says:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Justice, Dato Sir James Thomson, today dismissed an application by\r\n\r\nan  eminent  Queen's Counsel to appear in a civil appeal here next week,  saying\r\n\r\nthat the legal profession here should enjoy a certain measure of protection from\r\n\r\ncompetition from outside.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one stage of the hearing, Dato Sir James commented: \"If all the cream is\r\n\r\ntaken  away  by members of the English Bar, there will only remain skimmed  milk\r\n\r\nfor local lawyers.\"'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a sense of consideration for the local Bar which does him credit.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In his judgment, the Chief Justice said:\r\n\r\n\"The  application is made by a very eminent Queen's Counsel and it is admittedly\r\n\r\nmade for the purpose of coming to this country on a single occasion to appear in\r\n\r\na single case.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be noted that it is the first occasion since the setting up of a\r\n\r\njudicial  system  of the modern type in this country that it  has  been  thought\r\n\r\nnecessary or desirable to make any such application.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, of course, aware that such applications have been made from time to time\r\n\r\nin  the  former Straits Settlements and the State of Singapore, but this is  the\r\n\r\nfirst occasion in the history of this country that such an application has  been\r\n\r\nmade.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dato Sir James said the application raised two difficult questions.

But you will see, Sir, how\r\n\r\nvigorously  he  came  out. A sense of justice, not merely  for  the  profession,\r\n\r\nindividuals, but for the stature of the profession and in the public interest.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note, Sir, that we do not exclude a Queen's Counsel completely.\r\n\r\nI  am  sure no member of the Bar would seek that. But rather, we permit  Queen's\r\n\r\nCounsel  to be admitted in the court's discretion, Sir, and not in that  of  any\r\n\r\nadministrative or Government officer - if it is in the public interest.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recognise, Sir, that in a State where there are, I understand, some\r\n\r\n150  members of the Bar, there are certain aspects of the law which  are  rarely\r\n\r\nadumbrated. I have in mind, for example, Sir, a case of two or three years back,\r\n\r\nor  maybe a little more, where one oil company was claiming over $5 million from\r\n\r\nanother oil company in respect of deposits of oil which were taken over  by  the\r\n\r\nJapanese.  Now, that was a particularly difficult case with overtones  of  international  law, the law of confiscation during the War, and in that case  it  was\r\n\r\nquite  appropriate  that the Government itself should have had  Queen's  Counsel\r\n\r\nfrom  England,  and  the  oil  companies concerned  themselves  engaged  Queen's\r\n\r\nCounsel.  But,  Sir, you are not unconscious of other occasions  which,  if  not\r\n\r\nfrivolous,  and however important to the individuals concerned, were  not  of  a\r\n\r\ncharacter to require the presence of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\neminent Queen's Counsel, since the issues involved were such as were dealt  with\r\n\r\ndaily  by members of the Bar locally. But because of the wealth of the parties,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  saw  not  one, or two, but teams from the English Bar  to  handle  the\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not Queen's Counsel we want, except very rarely, and I am glad to\r\n\r\nsee  the provision made where on such occasions they can be admitted, but it  is\r\n\r\nsolicitors that we need, and that is why I have not moved, and I would  like  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  it, will not as yet move, any amendment to this Bill to prevent  non-citizens of Singapore and Malaya from practising in Singapore. This should come,\r\n\r\nSir,  this  must  come,  but I will not seek to urge it until  I  am  completely\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that, in fact, we have from our University an adequate  supply  of\r\n\r\nthose  trained  of  a calibre such as those we have had the pleasure  of  seeing\r\n\r\ngraduate but recently.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be my pleasure to support and vote for this Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, this is indeed a very happy occasion.

As the explanatory statement says, Mr Speaker:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This Bill amends the Advocates and Solicitors Ordinance to provide for the\r\n\r\nmore effective supervision of solicitors and solicitors'\r\n\r\naccounts and the control of the employment of solicitors' clerks.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may be forgiven, I am myself a solicitor practising in\r\n\r\nthis country, and I do not object one bit to the more effective supervision that\r\n\r\nis  being  imposed upon me and my firm and those like me who are  practising  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\nI do not object to it, Mr Speaker, for this\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nreason: it is my good fortune to practise as a solicitor, and as a solicitor, it\r\n\r\nis  my  duty and my privilege to uphold the rule of law in this country. Without\r\n\r\nthe  rule  of  law,  the  basic  foundation of our  system  of  government  will\r\n\r\ndisappear.  On  that basis, I am happy to be a solicitor and I am  happy  to  be\r\n\r\nassociated  in  the  maintenance of the rule of law. But  when  one  occupies  a\r\n\r\nposition  of privilege and, if I may say so, a position of power, that  position\r\n\r\nnecessitates that one does not exercise privilege and power wantonly, that there\r\n\r\nmust  be  curbs on that power. I am glad that these curbs are being  imposed  on\r\n\r\nthis  honourable profession in order that it might remain and continue to remain\r\n\r\nand, if I may say so, occupy an even more honourable position in our society.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other point which might be controversial and on which I\r\n\r\nwish  to speak, is the question of admission of Queen's Counsel. I only recently\r\n\r\ncame  to understand that a part of the provision of this new section is  not  entirely  in accord with the wishes of the general members of the Bar. I was  only\r\n\r\ninformed  this  afternoon that during my absence from Singapore this  particular\r\n\r\nprovision  was  posed before the general meeting of the Bar Committee  and  they\r\n\r\nfelt  in  their  wisdom  that  the phrase \"in the public  interest\"  should  be\r\n\r\nomitted.  I  am not in a position to know the reasons for that conclusion  which\r\n\r\nthe  meeting of the Bar came to. But as a Member of the Assembly, I am  speaking\r\n\r\nmore  in the general interest of the country and of the future of Singapore  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to the Federation. I would say that in all such matters, the Singapore\r\n\r\nBar  should work in unity with the Federation Bar, and I support this  provision\r\n\r\nalthough  it would appear that I am at variance with my fellow practitioners  at\r\n\r\nthe Bar on the basis that in future the Singapore Bar and the Federation Bar, in\r\n\r\nview of the political future of the two territories, should work together. I say\r\n\r\nthat  in  all  earnestness,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, because  the  Bar  is  intimately\r\n\r\nconnected with politics and because we are the upholders of the rule of law and,\r\n\r\nwithout the rule of law, our political system cannot survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am delighted to hear the words of kindness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthat flowed from the Member for Anson for once in our lifetime.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It will never happen again!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are sagacious enough to know that it would be\r\n\r\nuseful for us to take these words at their mere face value.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is churlish.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the matter which the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nreferred to just now, I was surprised to receive a note from the State Advocate-General this morning informing us that this particular provision of the Bill had\r\n\r\nbeen  considered by the Bar Committee and that they were most dissatisfied  with\r\n\r\nit.  And in the letter to the State Advocate-General from the Secretary of  the\r\n\r\nBar  Committee,  the  Bar  Committee referred the State  Advocate-General  to  a\r\n\r\nresolution  approved  at a general meeting of the Singapore  Bar  held  on  28th\r\n\r\nApril,  1962, where the Member for Anson's amendment to include a proviso  after\r\n\r\nthe  words  \"discretion\",  \"for special reasons  in  the  public  interest\"  was\r\n\r\nconsidered.

But nevertheless, I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is necessary  in\r\n\r\nall  these  matters  for  us to keep in line with the Federation,  and  I  think\r\n\r\ndespite  the views that the Bar Committee holds we would be acting appropriately\r\n\r\nif we proceeded to enact this clause.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr\r\n\r\nByrne].\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The first amendment*\r\n\r\nis dependent on the new clause.
