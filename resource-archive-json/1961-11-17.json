But I did see the  seven\r\n\r\nmembers   of   the  self-styled  ex-staff   Action\r\n\r\nCommittee  for  some two hours,  and  I  took  the\r\n\r\nprecaution of having the proceedings recorded.  As\r\n\r\na  result  of  the fact that the proceedings  were\r\n\r\nfaithfully recorded, there has been no argument as\r\n\r\nto what took place at that meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> r Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I wonder if the Prime Minister could tell us\r\n\r\nwhether he said words to the effect that, without\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P., there would be no People's Association\r\n\r\nand that if the employees of the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation valued their jobs, they must support\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. and act as political workers for the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in community centres. Did the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister at that meeting ask the seven members to\r\n\r\nconvey this to the other workers, and also ask\r\n\r\nthem to state their political stand?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The answer to the question\r\n\r\nsimply is that that is inaccurate. I have the tape\r\n\r\nrecordings. They are in the hands of the Secretary\r\n\r\nof the People's Association. I think it will take\r\n\r\nabout two to two and a half hours for the Member\r\n\r\nfor Mountbatten to listen to the whole\r\n\r\nproceedings. Most of them ere in Mandarin, but I\r\n\r\nam quite prepared to lend her an interpreter in\r\n\r\norder to follow the proceedings. The point that I\r\n\r\nemphasised to the workers of the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation was that they had to be loyal to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government, because that was the Government\r\n\r\nwhich created the People's Association and had the\r\n\r\nmajority of the members of the Board, which took\r\n\r\nover the functions of the Social Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment with respect to community centres. It\r\n\r\nis on the record, Sir, so the facilities are open\r\n\r\nto the Member for Mountbatten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nYesterday  the  Prime  Minister  said   that   the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association 110W has 400-odd members.

If they are paid, whether  they  are\r\n\r\npaid  according  to time: this also  includes  the\r\n\r\nstaff of the Social Welfare Department.

I would remind\r\n\r\nhim  that  certain employees went on strike there  and\r\n\r\nthey  were dismissed. In view of the very considerable\r\n\r\nunhappiness  about this issue, would he  not  consider\r\n\r\nappointing a Commission of Inquiry to investigate  the\r\n\r\nwhole aspect as suggested by the original questioner?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not want to go into an\r\n\r\nargument as to the definition of a strike. But if  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Anson  would  refer  to  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nDisputes  Ordinance, a strike there is a  stoppage  of\r\n\r\nwork  by  the concerted action of a group of employees\r\n\r\nwho are organised in a lawfully constituted union. You\r\n\r\ncan  have  all kinds of strikes. You can call stoppage\r\n\r\nof work by any name. But when you are talking about  a\r\n\r\nstrike  in this Assembly which makes the law,  we  are\r\n\r\ntalking about a strike in accordance with the law. The\r\n\r\nstrike at the People's Association is not a strike  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the law, for the simple  reason  that\r\n\r\nthere  is no union. There was no strike notice because\r\n\r\nthere is no union. 138 members decided to stop work in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  17 members who were sacked. And  although\r\n\r\nyou  have ruled that this does not arise, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I might just touch on this point. 450 are  full-time   and   part-time   workers   of   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.  138 decided to stop work in  support  of\r\n\r\n17.  What can we do, Mr Speaker, Sir? As I have said,\r\n\r\nif we are going to have this Commission of Inquiry,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think the Commission should be set up on  the\r\n\r\nreasons  for  the  stoppage, because the  stoppage  is\r\n\r\nobvious.  They said the reason why they  stopped  work\r\n\r\nwas  that they wanted the 17 workers reinstated.  They\r\n\r\nwanted  the  Action Committee of seven  who  called  a\r\n\r\nmeeting   in   defiance  of  authority  also   to   be\r\n\r\nreinstated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain this to those who have not been\r\n\r\nfollowing the Press reports? it is a bit tedious,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. I met the seven people. They represented\r\n\r\nthemselves and 138 others. I cannot remember the exact\r\n\r\ndate.  We  recorded the proceedings. I said  to  them,\r\n\r\n\"Convey to the members of the Association whom you say\r\n\r\nyou represent that they have to be loyal to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government and not take sides with the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  and  in particular my former  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary, the Member for Upper Serangoon, the  former\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Health,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Nee Soon, who were the  Chairman  and\r\n\r\nmember  respectively of the Selection Board whilst  in\r\n\r\nactual  charge of recruiting. I said, \"I do  not  care\r\n\r\nwhat your personal relationships were, but we have the\r\n\r\nright  to  expect  loyalty to the  Board  and  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that has to supervise the  expenditure  of\r\n\r\nfunds.\"  All this is fortunately on the record.  As  I\r\n\r\nsaid to them at the time of the interview - and this was\r\n\r\nalso  recorded -   if  they gave  a  version  after  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  which  was different from what was  recorded,\r\n\r\nthen  I would play this over Radio Singapore to  prove\r\n\r\nwho  spoke  the truth. And as I have said,  they  kept\r\n\r\nquiet  on what transpired at the meeting. They replied\r\n\r\nto  me  and  said,  \"Well, tell  the  workers  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association yourself.\" I said,  \"Cannot  you\r\n\r\ntell  it  to them, that they have to be loyal  to  the\r\n\r\nBoard  and the Government, and not to individuals  who\r\n\r\nmay,   for  divers  reasons,  have  selected  you   or\r\n\r\nrecruited  you?\" They said, \"Call a meeting,  and  you\r\n\r\nshould  be  present  as Chairman to  tell  it  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\" And I did. I called a meeting, I think,  for\r\n\r\nthe  following  day. I am not sure. But the  following\r\n\r\nday was a Saturday. Notices went out to all workers to\r\n\r\nbe  present.  Now  these 7 workers,  in  defiance  and\r\n\r\ncontrary  to what they had suggested to me,  called  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  of their own at the same time. We called  the\r\n\r\nmeeting for 1.00 p.m. at the City Hall Chamber of  all\r\n\r\nthe  450 workers for me to tell them that they  should\r\n\r\ndisengage themselves from political intriguing and in-fighting.  Otherwise they would be involved  and  they\r\n\r\nwould  get smacked down. These seven chaps, using  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association's  channels  of  communication,\r\n\r\nofficial  channels, said that there was a  meeting  at\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association H.Q. at 12.00 o'clock, using\r\n\r\nmy  name,  using the name of Mr Tan Chok Kian,  Chief\r\n\r\nExecutive  Officer, and said that they were  going  to\r\n\r\naddress  this meeting, and drew a crowd away from  the\r\n\r\nCity Chamber to their meeting. Sir, people who do that\r\n\r\nsort\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof thing, when I had given them the\r\n\r\ncourtesy  of an interview, had met them and  discussed\r\n\r\nthe  matter  with them, and had called  a  meeting  at\r\n\r\ntheir  suggestion - it is on the record, on  the  tape - I\r\n\r\ncalled  a  meeting and they called a contrary meeting.\r\n\r\nAnd  they  said,  \"Look at the  number  of  chaps  who\r\n\r\nsupport us, who come to our meeting, and how few go to\r\n\r\nyour  meeting.\" Sir, 138 out of 450. We then  went  to\r\n\r\neach  and every one and said, \"Please explain why  you\r\n\r\ndid  not attend the meeting as officially called.\" And\r\n\r\nmany of them did. But they were tricked into attending\r\n\r\nthe contrary meeting. The matter was considered by the\r\n\r\nBoard of Management who decided to dismiss these seven\r\n\r\nwho  organised this meeting, to which they had  called\r\n\r\nthe  17  who  were already dismissed to  harangue  the\r\n\r\ncrowd  and  whip up feelings. I say this.  If  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  have  a Commission of Inquiry,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  go  into the causes  of  the  so-called\r\n\r\nstrike,  because the reason is obvious. We sacked  the\r\n\r\n17  because  of  their association  with  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosalis, because they actively used community  centres\r\n\r\nand  instigated people against the Government. But  if\r\n\r\nthey go on with these acts of hooliganism and violence\r\n\r\nand break windows, tables, chairs and telephones in my\r\n\r\nown constituency and the Yan Kit Community Centre - they\r\n\r\ntook delight in dismantling the telephone and broke it\r\n\r\ninto pieces - then I say, let us have an inquiry to  see\r\n\r\nwho really moves these little pawns on the chessboard.\r\n\r\nIs it -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

If the Member for Thomson  wants\r\n\r\nto legalise a strike by a group of workers who are not\r\n\r\norganised  into a union, who have not got a Committee,\r\n\r\nwho  have  not got registered members, then I  say  to\r\n\r\nhim,  ask for leave to introduce a Bill which  can  be\r\n\r\nreferred  to a Select Committee, where they can  argue\r\n\r\nwhy  any  stoppage  of  work  should  be  made  legal,\r\n\r\nincluding  stoppages by members of this Assembly,  and\r\n\r\nso  on and so forth.

At  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of meetings held in December 1960, the  matter\r\n\r\nwas  brought  up  before certain trade union  leaders,\r\n\r\nwhich  included the Member for Thomson, if I  may  say\r\n\r\nso, and other big leaders of the trade union movement,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Mr  Lim Ching Siong, Mr Woodhull  and  Mr\r\n\r\nDominic  Puthucheary.  He proposed  to  them  that  an\r\n\r\nunemployment insurance scheme be introduced  forthwith\r\n\r\non   a   tripartite  basis,  with  contributions  from\r\n\r\nemployers  and  employees,  and  with  the  Government\r\n\r\nmeeting all costs and liabilities of the fund for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  year  of operation. The administration  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral    Provident    Fund   would    prepare    the\r\n\r\nadministrative and financial details of the operation.\r\n\r\nThese  trade  union  leaders,  however,  rejected  the\r\n\r\nproposal. Under the proposed scheme, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  unemployed would be entitled to benefits of about\r\n\r\n40 per cent of their working pay. The Finance Minister\r\n\r\nbrought up this proposal so that workers may feel less\r\n\r\nanxiety   over  losing  jobs  through  redundancy   or\r\n\r\nretrenchment.  One of the major causes  of  industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes has been the retrenchment of workers, and  an\r\n\r\nunemployment  insurance scheme would help  to  improve\r\n\r\nrelations  between labour and management  by  removing\r\n\r\none of the major irritants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, does the Minister\r\n\r\nconsider that the trade union leaders referred  to  by\r\n\r\nhim  truly  represent  the  trade  union  movement  of\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> I think, Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\ntrade  union  leaders referred to by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill will themselves have to answer this.

The  community  centres  are\r\n\r\nmanned mainly by voluntary workers: more than 1,000 in\r\n\r\nall.

If he does this, the answer could be  as\r\n\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rather expected the Member for Tanglin to say that. If this is the evidence\r\n\r\non which he bases his conclusion, then it merely shows that one must be very careful in handling\r\n\r\nstatistics. Variations in employment figures collected by the Labour Department are often due\r\n\r\nto the completeness which employers make in respect of returns. Sometimes the percentage of \r\n\r\nemployers making the returns is higher than at other times. So variations in figures collected \r\n\r\nonly indicate the thoroughness with which the returns have been collected. Also, there are\r\n\r\ndifferences in definitions. The Labour Department statistics gives figures of employment of workmen\r\n\r\nas defined in the Labour Code. Some time in the past, people such as trishaw riders and taxi-drivers had\r\n\r\nbeen included in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour statistics. Subsequently they were excluded; hence the decline in total employment figures  resulted.\r\n\r\nThis decline is, of course, quite illusory. Some Members may think it strange that the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nshould publicly disparage the statistics collected by his Ministry. I done as properly as it should be. This\r\n\r\nis because we inherited a defective system from the previous Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

This list of goods would include those  which\r\n\r\nare  produced  in  the  two territories or which  can  be  advantageously\r\n\r\nproduced in them. This will enable us to preserve substantially the  free\r\n\r\nport  status  of  Singapore  while affording  an  impetus  to  industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion  through  a large protected market in respect  of  a  range  of\r\n\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Federation's point of view, the proposal does not offer any\r\n\r\ncompensating  advantages  to  the  Federation  for  the  advantages   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  would derive from it. Goods produced in the Federation,  except\r\n\r\nfor  hard soap, already enjoy duty free entry into Singapore. The proposed\r\n\r\ncommon  market  would  confer  upon their manufacturers  little  advantage\r\n\r\nbeyond what they are already enjoying except perhaps that they would  then\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  enjoy  a  protected market as well in  the  Federation.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  this argument holds true only if Singapore refrains from imposing\r\n\r\nimport  duties  on goods we manufacture. There is also a  loss  of  import\r\n\r\nduty  to  the  Federation Government on Singapore produced goods  entering\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. The Federation also feels that Singapore  with  its  free\r\n\r\nport  status, with its excellent harbour and its strategic position across\r\n\r\nocean  world's shipping lines, would obtain a preponderant advantage  over\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.  Further in the Federation import duties  are  levied  on\r\n\r\nsome  materials entering manufacturing processes. The industries  affected\r\n\r\nmay  be  at a disadvantage in competing with similar industries  based  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because the Federation desired that some safeguards against the\r\n\r\ncompetitive  power  of  Singapore industries should  be  introduced  that\r\n\r\ndifficult  problems arose which could not be settled so far  between  the\r\n\r\nteams of officials discussing the problem. The Federation Government  for\r\n\r\nitself would be happy to see a common market established which is  based\r\n\r\non  a  complete customs union. This would equalise once and for  all  the\r\n\r\ncomparative  production  of goods between the  two  territories  but  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to accept the solution would mean the abandonment  of  a  free\r\n\r\nport  status,  a measure which cannot be contemplated now. The  foregoing\r\n\r\ngives  the general background to the reasons why discussions between  the\r\n\r\nofficials of the two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nGovernments  have  reached  a  state  of  temporary  deadlock  and  the\r\n\r\nappointment of a team of international experts is a measure which the  two\r\n\r\nGovernments have agreed upon to break this deadlock. It is my belief  that\r\n\r\nit  is  not beyond the ingenuity of that of men to resolve these difficult\r\n\r\nand  complex problems. My belief also is that these problems can be solved\r\n\r\nif we regard the common market proposal from the broader perspective of  a\r\n\r\npan-Malayan outlook which can over-ride sectional interests.

My understand\r\n\r\ning  of his question is that he is asking for some form of permanent trade\r\n\r\nrepresentation  in these two countries. In my view, there is  very  little\r\n\r\nthat we would gain. Perhaps I could elaborate on this issue. In fact,  the\r\n\r\nmost  important  duty of any trade representation abroad is  to  help  the\r\n\r\ncountry he is representing to increase its export trade, to make it easier\r\n\r\nfor  domestic industrialists and traders to sell to that country. That  is\r\n\r\nbasic.  All  foreign trade missions are there to advance and  promote  the\r\n\r\ninterests of their\r\n\r\ndomestic producers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are to inquire into the nature of our trade with the two\r\n\r\ncountries, namely, China and India, we will find that the goods  that  we\r\n\r\nare  exporting to them are what you might call tropical raw materials  in\r\n\r\none  form  or the other. For instance, we exported to China in  1960  $73\r\n\r\nmillion of crude rubber, $6 million worth of mineral fuels, and nearly $4\r\n\r\nmillion  worth  of  animal and vegetable oils. They are not  manufactured\r\n\r\ngoods; they are not branded articles; and a trade mission cannot help  in\r\n\r\nany  way.  The trade representative will not be able either to induce  or\r\n\r\npersuade China to increase her imports of these goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with India. We exported in 1960 to India $36 million worth of\r\n\r\ncrude rubber, $11 million worth of oil seeds,\r\n\r\n$7\ufffd  million worth of vegetable and animal oils, and $4 million worth  of\r\n\r\npetroleum.  On  the other hand, we import from these two  countries  very\r\n\r\nsubstantial  amounts  of  consumer goods - textiles  principally - a  certain\r\n\r\namount of foodstuffs, fruits and vegetables and, by and large, it is  not\r\n\r\nthe responsibility of\r\n\r\ntrade representatives in either of these countries to promote the exports\r\n\r\nof  other countries to ours. That is something which is the duty of  that\r\n\r\ncountry to do. So, as I have said, going through the nature of our  trade\r\n\r\nwith  these  two  countries, very little is to be gained at  the  present\r\n\r\nmoment  by  stationing  permanent  trade  missions  there.  It  is  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent  with Indonesia for whom we are the supply base, so  to  speak,\r\n\r\nfor substantial parts of the Indonesian Archipelago.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, in some instances, our merchants and shippers are meeting with\r\n\r\nconsiderable  difficulty.

No summonses were issued to Singapore Traction Company\r\n\r\nbus conductors during the same period, or, for that matter, conductors  of\r\n\r\nChinese bus companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action was taken against taxi drivers because, in their case, they tout\r\n\r\nfor  extra passengers, whereas buses do not. Circumstances regarding buses\r\n\r\nare  quite  different. However, Government is considering the  regulations\r\n\r\ngoverning the overloading of passenger buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions were held with the various Chinese bus companies and the\r\n\r\nS.T.C. as well as the drivers and conductors some time back with a view  to\r\n\r\nseeking  their co-operation and safety-first measures. At the  talks  given\r\n\r\nto  the conductors and drivers, one of their complaints was that they  were\r\n\r\nunable  to  prevent the overloading of passengers single-handed,  and  that\r\n\r\nmore  often than not they were sandwiched inside the bus and unable to  get\r\n\r\nto  the  door to control would-be bus passengers surging in and hanging  on\r\n\r\nto the rails of the door.

We  cannot, at the same time, afford to assist  aided  schools  by\r\n\r\ngiving dollar for dollar for an unlimited sum. We cannot spend money  both\r\n\r\nways to build Government schools for all language streams and, at the next\r\n\r\nmoment,  assist  aided  schools dollar for dollar  to  the  tune  of  many\r\n\r\nmillions.

So could the Minister inform this House  whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  prepared to give unconditionally grant-in-aid  or  capital\r\n\r\ngrants to schools, provided the schools really need them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Changi, who used to\r\n\r\nassist  me  in  the  Ministry of Education, is fortunately  aware  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties which the Ministry of Education has to contend  with  in  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of  grant-in-aid.  It is true that the  Grant-in-Aid  Regulations,\r\n\r\n1957,  do  state that no grant-in-aid shall be approved in  respect  of  a\r\n\r\nschool building unless the manager or trustees of the school hold a  legal\r\n\r\nand  unencumbered  title  to the land on which  the  school  premises  are\r\n\r\nsituated,  for  a period to be approved by the Director of  Education.  So\r\n\r\nmost  of the difficulties have arisen in that aided schools do not have  a\r\n\r\nlegal unencumbered title to the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at the moment - in fact, we have for some time now been trying to\r\n\r\namend the Grant-in-Aid Regulations by making them less stringent.

I hope to be able to state in the near future that the present\r\n\r\nregulations would be somewhat relaxed so that we can get on with assisting\r\n\r\nthe smaller rural schools which I have in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): With regard to the reply of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education,  does  the Minister pay attention to  the  fact  that  this\r\n\r\ndevelopment has disregarded the aided schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid the Member for Choa Chu\r\n\r\nKang  is  just  labouring the question. I have explained that  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment wants to shoulder full responsibility in regard to education for\r\n\r\nall language streams. Therefore, it has decided to build 19 schools a year.\r\n\r\nThis  will  mean  that as time goes on, everyone can  find  a  place  in  a\r\n\r\nGovernment school. But unfortunately if in the past aided schools have been\r\n\r\ngoing  on without any assistance, we cannot solve their problem within  one\r\n\r\nor  two years. We can only do so when schools are available for everyone to\r\n\r\nmove in. Therefore, since we have already indicated that we shall set aside\r\n\r\n$1 million to assist aided schools, mainly the rural aided schools, then  I\r\n\r\nthink  we have done exceedingly well, provided we revise the present Grant-in-Aid Regulations and relax them somewhat, as suggested by the Member  for\r\n\r\nChangi.

He is certainly going far from the  subject,\r\n\r\nSir.  But  I  would just say that the Member for Choa Chu  Kang  is  simply\r\n\r\nprobably justifying his existence in the Assembly by putting questions when\r\n\r\nthey  are really unnecessary. I have, in fact, explained to the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  the place of aided schools in our educational system,  because  he\r\n\r\nhas always been a great protagonist of the part which aided schools\r\n\r\nhave  played in the educational system of Singapore. I have already  acknow\r\n\r\nledged  their importance in our educational system during the  period  when\r\n\r\nGovernment  was not prepared to shoulder full responsibility for education.\r\n\r\nBut when the Government has decided that it would take on the education  of\r\n\r\nall  its  children  and  give them more and more education  in  fact,  then\r\n\r\nnaturally  the  role of aided schools will be less and less  as  Government\r\n\r\nschools get more and more. Therefore, we cannot build more and more schools\r\n\r\nand  bring  them into the Government stream and at the same  time  keep  on\r\n\r\npumping money into the aided schools. You cannot have it both\r\n\r\nways.  Therefore, if we build 19 schools a year to house all  streams,  we\r\n\r\ncan only afford $1 million as capital aid for aided schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CHINESE AND ENGLISH SCHOOL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TEACHERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Number of registration certificates cancelled and number of applications for registration rejected)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. <b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b> asked the Minister for Education (a) how many\r\n\r\nChinese   and   English  School  teachers  have  had  their   registration\r\n\r\ncertificates  cancelled since 3rd June, 1959, and  the  reasons  for  such\r\n\r\ncancellations; and (b) how many applications for registration as  teachers\r\n\r\nhave  been  rejected  since 3rd June, 1959 and the  reasons  for  such  rejections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) No Chinese school teacher has had his registration certificate can\r\n\r\ncelled  since 3rd June, 1959, but one Private English school  teacher\r\n\r\nhad  his  registration  certificate cancelled  on  grounds  of  moral\r\n\r\nturpitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Since 3rd June, 1959, the number of applications for registration as\r\n\r\nteachers which were rejected was 21, for the following reasons :-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Security grounds                                      18 \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  Poor attendance at Teachers' Training College          2\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  Unsatisfactory professional conduct                    1\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                Total                                   21\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Minister\r\n\r\ntell  this  House the reasons in respect of those whose applications  were\r\n\r\nrejected on political grounds?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The answer is yes.

It is not true that parents  did\r\n\r\nnot go to register their children in Chinese schools because there were  no\r\n\r\nplaces,  because  every  primary school, whatever  the  language  media  of\r\n\r\ninstruction,  was more or less a registration centre. It was  left  to  the\r\n\r\nparents  themselves  to choose which language media  they  wished  to  have\r\n\r\ntheir children registered for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I have heard\r\n\r\nthe  reply given by the Minister just now to the effect that because there\r\n\r\nwere fewer number of Chinese schools, therefore the choice depended on the\r\n\r\nparents  where  they wished to send their children. I  want  to  quote  an\r\n\r\nexample. In my constituency there is a Chinese Primary School by the  name\r\n\r\nof  Hang  Siang School. The number of new pupils enrolled there  was  117.\r\n\r\nBecause there was no vacancy there, the parents turned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  other schools. Many joined English schools instead. But according  to\r\n\r\nmy  understanding, that school has already applied for an extension of the\r\n\r\nschool   building,  but  it  has  not  received  any  approval  from   the\r\n\r\nauthorities concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Minister aware of that?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I could explain, Sir, that the inference started by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Choa Chu Kang and carried on by the Member for Toa Payoh is\r\n\r\nthat, because there was no place in the Chinese schools, the parents  were\r\n\r\ntherefore seduced to go to the English schools. Every school is allowed to\r\n\r\nregister pupils. It is true that there is a limitation in every school  to\r\n\r\nthe number it can take. I mean a school does not just open and take in all\r\n\r\nPrimary I pupils. Each school would indicate whether it could take in  40,\r\n\r\n400  or 4,000 pupils. As far as possible, every primary school should have\r\n\r\na number of different standards to give it some balance, but it is left to\r\n\r\nparents to register. If, for example, the school could take in 100 pupils,\r\n\r\nit  might  register  150 pupils, but the remaining  50  pupils  would  be\r\n\r\noffered  places in a Chinese school if that is what the parents want.  But\r\n\r\nif  parents choose to have their children registered in an English school,\r\n\r\nwell,  it is only fair that they are offered places in an English  school.\r\n\r\nSo  the  determinant factor lies with the parents. Members on the opposite\r\n\r\nBenches,  including the Front Bench, are aware that many Chinese  families\r\n\r\ndo send their children one-half to English schools and one-half to Chinese\r\n\r\nschools.

I am not saying that the Housing Board has  not\r\n\r\ndone  its  duty as far as investigating the lighting of such  buildings  in\r\n\r\nKallang is concerned, but I have already indicated to them that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Mountbatten was concerned about this problem. They have reported  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  satisfied.  At  any rate, if the Member  for  Mountbatten  could\r\n\r\ncommunicate with me about specific cases, I will definitely look into them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>KALLANG FLATS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Refuse chutes and containers)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for National Development\r\n\r\nwhether  he  is  aware that at the Housing and Development Board  flats  at\r\n\r\nKallang some refuse chutes are without covers and the refuse containers  at\r\n\r\nthe bottom\r\n\r\nof  the  chutes  are full of big holes, and what steps are proposed  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken in the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> As far as I am aware, the Housing and Development Board\r\n\r\nhas  been efficient in the management of its housing estates.

It seeks to  declare\r\n\r\nand  define  the  privileges, immunities and powers of the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly and of its Members.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 59 of the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958,\r\n\r\nprovides that:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It shall be lawful, by law enacted under this Order, to determine\r\n\r\nand regulate the privileges, immunities and powers of the Assembly and\r\n\r\nits Members, but no such privileges, immunities or powers shall exceed\r\n\r\nthose of the Commons' House of Parliament\r\n\r\nin the United Kingdom or of the Members thereof.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill, therefore, states the general principle upon\r\n\r\nwhich  it  has been drafted. The House of Commons has the right  to  be\r\n\r\nthe sole judge of the lawfulness of its own proceedings. This right  is\r\n\r\nprovided  for in section 48, subsection (1) of the Singapore  (Constitu\r\n\r\ntion)  Order  in  Council, 1958, which gives power to the  Assembly  to\r\n\r\nmake,  amend and revoke Standing Orders for the regulation and  conduct\r\n\r\nof its own proceedings and the despatch of business.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, sub-clause (2) of the Bill takes the matter further,\r\n\r\nproviding  as  it .does for exemption of any person from liability  for\r\n\r\nany act done under the authority of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill also, inter alia, provides that the proceedings\r\n\r\nin  the Assembly shall not be liable to be impeached or questioned  in\r\n\r\nany  court,  commission  of  inquiry,  tribunal  or  any  other  place\r\n\r\nwhatsoever out of the Assembly. The privilege of freedom of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeech in the House of Commons is absolute, and any attempt to obstruct  or\r\n\r\nimpede  any  Member  in the exercise of this privilege,  for  example,  any\r\n\r\nintimidation  of  Members or molestation of Members  on  account  of  their\r\n\r\nconduct  in  Parliament  is  a  breach  of  privilege.  This  privilege  is\r\n\r\nspecifically provided for in clause 4 and clause 5, sub-clause (1)  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.  At the same time, it is the duty of each Member to refrain from  any\r\n\r\ncourse  of  action  prejudicial  to the  privilege  which  he  enjoys.  The\r\n\r\nprivilege  of  freedom of speech does not confer on any Member unrestrained\r\n\r\nlicence of speech in the House. He remains accountable to the House  itself\r\n\r\nfor words spoken in debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 20 and 21 of the Bill, therefore, seek to give power to the Assembly to proceed with cases of contempt and punish where contempt,\r\n\r\ndishonourable conduct and abuse of privilege have been proved.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Commons has the right to punish its own Members for contempt\r\n\r\n(including a breach of privilege), abuse of privilege (especially an  abuse\r\n\r\nof  the  privilege of freedom of speech) and dishonourable conduct, as  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  corrupt acceptance of payment for disclosure of  information\r\n\r\nabout  matters to be proceeded within the House obtained from other Members\r\n\r\nunder  the  obligation of secrecy. In the House of Commons, the  punishment\r\n\r\nwhich  may  be  meted  out  for  breaches  of  privilege  or  contempt   is\r\n\r\ncommitment,  that  is,  imprisonment, expulsion of Members,  suspension  of\r\n\r\nMembers,  fines and reprimands. However, it is not proposed  in  this  Bill\r\n\r\nthat  the  power  of  commitment should be given to  the  Assembly.  If  an\r\n\r\noffender  is  to be deprived of his liberty, it should be  by  order  of  a\r\n\r\ncourt  of law. Similarly, it is not proposed to give the Assembly power  to\r\n\r\nexpel its Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill, therefore, provides that the Assembly shall have\r\n\r\nno  power  to commit any person to prison or to expel any Member  from  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. However, Part V of the Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlists  out  the  offences  under  which  the  State  Advocate-General  can\r\n\r\ninstitute criminal proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to suspend a Member is provided for in clause 20 of the Bill.\r\n\r\nPower is also given in clause 22 of the Bill for punishment in one session\r\n\r\nor  in one Assembly of offences which have been committed in another. This\r\n\r\nclause  also  provides that where the Assembly considers that an  offender\r\n\r\nhas not been punished or not been sufficiently punished in one session  or\r\n\r\nin  the Assembly by reason of the early ending of a session, he may  again\r\n\r\nbe  dealt  with  in  the  next  session or Assembly  until  the  House  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to impose fines is provided for in clause 20 of the Bill. It is\r\n\r\nproposed that the fine imposed be treated as a debt due to the Government,\r\n\r\nand power is given in clause 23 of the Bill for the State Advocate-General\r\n\r\nto  sue  for and recover the fine. The power to reprimand and admonish  is\r\n\r\nprovided for in clause 20 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Commons has the power to require the attendance of wit\r\n\r\nnesses. This is specifically provided for in clauses 12, 13, 14 and 15  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  Power  to  secure the attendance  of  persons  on  matters  of\r\n\r\nprivilege is specifically provided for in clauses 12, 13, 24 and 25 of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the power to order and issue a warrant for the arrest of persons\r\n\r\nguilty of contempt and breach of privilege is specifically provided for in\r\n\r\nclauses 26 and 27 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Members of the House that it was the intention of\r\n\r\nthe  Government to introduce this Bill in the last session of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it was to give time to Mr Speaker to study precedents  elsewhere\r\n\r\nand to discuss with the Fourth Clerk of the House of Commons when he was in\r\n\r\nLondon for the C.P.A. Conference during the months of September and October\r\n\r\nthat the introduction of this Bill was deferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is a non-political Bill, and that was why you, Mr Speaker, was\r\n\r\nconsulted on this Bill. The provisions of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  apply to all Members of the Assembly. It has been  drafted  not\r\n\r\nfrom  the  view-point of party politics, but from the necessity  to  define\r\n\r\nclearly  the  rights and privileges of Members and of  the  Assembly  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole,  and  to ensure that the proceedings in the House be conducted  with\r\n\r\norderliness  and  with dignity. When proceedings in Parliament  or  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  are reduced to mud-slinging and a free-for-all affair,  then  the\r\n\r\npractice of parliamentary democracy will be in danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to you, Mr Speaker, for\r\n\r\nyour considerable assistance in the drafting of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, having heard that you have already\r\n\r\ncast your vigilant eye over this Bill, we feel more satisfied that somebody\r\n\r\nhas  checked the possible twists and turns of the P.A.P. We know  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  is  quite capable of such things, and we are very happy, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nyou have discharged your duty in the interests of all of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realised that this Bill is not a political Bill; that the provisions\r\n\r\napply to each and every one of us. But on principle, we do not agree to the\r\n\r\nhaste  with which the P.A.P. is trying to rush this Bill through.  Anything\r\n\r\ndone  in haste cannot possibly have the best thinking given to the subject.\r\n\r\nAnd  we remember, Sir, how the rushing through of Bills during the 1959 and\r\n\r\n1960 sessions had led to innumerable amendments which had to be introduced\r\n\r\nin this Chamber later on. Just on that alone I am sure we would not like to\r\n\r\nrush  this Bill through. Despite this we would not mind allowing this  Bill\r\n\r\nto  go through quickly, but for the fact that the P.A.P. has not been doing\r\n\r\nthings in the proper way all these months. Just for instance, Sir, even the\r\n\r\nOrder Paper of this sitting was sent to us only on the last day.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The delay, I\r\n\r\nthink - I did inquire about the delay in regard to this particular Order\r\n\r\nPaper - was really in the printing, mainly because 58 questions are being\r\n\r\nasked. I do not think it is proper to say that it is the P.A.P. or the\r\n\r\nGovernment benches that are responsible for the Order Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I apologise.

But I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  he is in order if he tries to introduce into his statement alleged\r\n\r\nbreaches by the Government benches on other occasions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If the Government is sincere in asking for\r\n\r\nconstructive  criticism from the opposition, and if  the  Leader  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  is sincere when talking about parliamentary democracy, as  he  has\r\n\r\njust  mentioned,  then surely, Sir, proper time should be  given  to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition to study the Bill. As it is, I do not think any of  us  really\r\n\r\nhad  sufficient  time  to  go  through the  Bill  properly.  Under  those\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  do you not think, Sir, it would be much  better  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to send the Bill to Select Committee and make sure  that  all\r\n\r\nthe  possible mistakes are corrected 'and all the best thinking is  given\r\n\r\nto the Bill? In addition, in the Bill itself, there are quite a number of\r\n\r\npoints  as  regards  definitions  which are  all  very  vague - words  like\r\n\r\ndishonourable conduct, insult and menace. Why cannot some effort be  made\r\n\r\nat  definition? At least we would then know where we would transgress and\r\n\r\nwhere  we  would go wrong. As it is, none of us can be very  sure.

Sir, the Bill, as it stands now, is a  great  blow\r\n\r\nto  our democratic system and will henceforth hamper freedom of speech and\r\n\r\ndebate  in this Assembly. There are many objectionable provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nBill  despite  the  short  time  we have  been  given  to  study  it.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has refused the request of many Members of the  Opposition  to\r\n\r\nrefer the Bill to a Select Committee for careful consideration.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past one year, since the suspension moved a year ago, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  had  a year to draft and study all the  implications  and\r\n\r\nramifications of such a Bill. But the Opposition Members were only given a\r\n\r\nfew days to study such an important Bill.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite our request, the Government is determined to steamroller\r\n\r\nsuch  a  Bill which will affect all Members of this Assembly. Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant that in such a Bill where Assemblymen, members of the public and\r\n\r\nthe Press are involved, time should be given for the parties concerned  to\r\n\r\nmake  representations to a Select Committee. I cannot  see  where  is  the\r\n\r\nurgency  of  such a Bill. In my view, there are more pressing problems  in\r\n\r\nthe  country which require the urgent attention of Government than passing\r\n\r\nsuch a Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Leader of the House just now that such a Bill should\r\n\r\nnot  be a political Bill. Such a Bill, Sir, should not be a controversial\r\n\r\nBill. Such a Bill should get the unanimous assent of all Members of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly. Such a Bill will lose the effect of upholding its avowed policy\r\n\r\nwhich  is,  as has been said, to uphold the dignity and prestige  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse.  Sir,  the Government should give up all attempts  to  steamroller\r\n\r\nsuch a Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very well for the Leader of the House to say that we are\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  House of Commons, but we know very well  that  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain  rules  and conventions which bind the conduct of the.  House  of\r\n\r\nCommons.  If I may say so, we are just like an infant, whereas the  House\r\n\r\nof  Commons is like our great-grandfather.

For instance, Part IV  starts  with  a\r\n\r\nvery beautiful clause:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Assembly shall have no power to commit any person to prison, nor\r\n\r\nshall the Assembly have power to expel any member\r\n\r\nfrom the Assembly.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But  one should read clause 20 - the punitive provisions - where it has  been\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'20.-(1) For any dishonourable conduct, abuse of privilege or contempt,\r\n\r\non the part of a member, the Assembly may -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) impose upon him a fine not exceeding the sum of five thousand\r\n\r\ndollars;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) suspend him from the service of the Assembly for the remainder of\r\n\r\nthe current session of the Assembly or\r\n\r\nfor any part thereof; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) direct that he be reprimanded or admonished in his place by the\r\n\r\nSpeaker.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I am an offending Member, I would honestly say\r\n\r\nthat  I would prefer to be expelled from the Assembly rather than  pay  a\r\n\r\nfine  of  $5,000  and be suspended during the remainder  of  the  current\r\n\r\nsession.  So I feel that the punitive provisions under clause  20  negate\r\n\r\nall the beautiful phrases in clause 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, likewise the other punitive provisions in the Bill which negate\r\n\r\nthis beautiful clause, i.e. clause 4:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'4. There shall be freedom of speech and debate and proceedings in the\r\n\r\nAssembly, and such freedom of speech and debate and proceedings shall not\r\n\r\nbe  liable  to  be impeached or questioned in any court,  commission  of\r\n\r\ninquiry, tribunal or any other place whatsoever out of the Assembly.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would honestly say that if I were an offending\r\n\r\nMember, having been found guilty of any abuse of privilege or of  any  of\r\n\r\nfence laid down in this Bill, then I would prefer to defend myself in a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourt  of  law rather than before a Committee of Privileges which comprises\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  trying their fellow Assemblymen; not to say that at  least  in\r\n\r\nthe  courts of law I can have the opportunity to be represented by  counsel\r\n\r\nand where the proceedings are open to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the punitive provisions of the Bill are very severe. For an offence,\r\n\r\na  Member can be fined up to a maximum of $5,000. For argument's sake, if a\r\n\r\nMember  happens to commit 10 offences during two days of Question Time,  he\r\n\r\ncan  be  fined  up  to a maximum. of $50,000. I wish to  know  whether  our\r\n\r\ninsurance  companies  in  Singapore could take insurance  policies  on  the\r\n\r\noccupational  hazards  of  Assemblymen! Sir, an  Assemblyman  can  also  be\r\n\r\nsuspended  and  at  the same time his pay can be stopped.  There  are  many\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  who  depend on their allowance to carryon  their  constituency\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is most important, Sir, is that what is spoken in one Session or in\r\n\r\none  Assembly can be brought up for trial in another Session or in another\r\n\r\nAssembly.  In other words, any Member who is on the Government  bench  now\r\n\r\nand  happens to be in the Opposition 10 years hence - his speeches  will  be\r\n\r\nrecorded  in  Hansard - can  be brought up and be  tried  for  any  of  the\r\n\r\noffences laid down in the Bill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under clause 35 a person may be fined the maximum fine of $5,000 to $10,000 for an offence, and he may be imprisoned at the same time for periods between 2 years and 7 years. I think, Sir, these are harsh sentences\r\n\r\nnormally  reserved for kidnappers, bandits and murderers. I am  sure  they\r\n\r\nare not for offending Assemblymen.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these punitive provisions will be like a sword hanging over our\r\n\r\nnecks. Sir, it has been stressed during my speech that the Opposition have\r\n\r\nnot  had  much  time  to  study this Bill. In the  name  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy, this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee for  careful\r\n\r\nand detailed consideration. I am sure all Members of this Assembly are  as\r\n\r\nanxious as we are to uphold the dignity and prestige\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  House.  I  am sure that all will agree that  only  a  Bill  which\r\n\r\nreceives  the  unanimous assent of the House will be able to achieve  that\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Government again to consider carefully whether this\r\n\r\nBill should be referred to a Select Committee?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we must express our\r\n\r\nangry  and  strong  feelings and protest against the Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\n(Privileges,  Immunities  and Powers) Bill  tabled  by  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After studying this Bill, we have come to know that it is not the motive\r\n\r\nand  intention  of this Bill to let Members of the House enjoy  freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech. On the contrary, it is the leadership of the P.A.P. that is  making\r\n\r\nuse  of  their  power  to deprive Opposition Members of  their  freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech in the Assembly. Therefore, this Bill does not aim at upholding  the\r\n\r\ndignity  of  parliamentary  democracy. On  the  contrary,  it  is  a  great\r\n\r\ndeparture  from  the spirit of democracy. We all know that  the  system  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy has come from England. Therefore, in  England  this\r\n\r\nsystem  of  parliamentary  democracy has a long  standing.  The  people  of\r\n\r\nEngland  have  full  confidence in the system of parliamentary  democracy,\r\n\r\nbecause  no  matter  which Party is in power, the spirit  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  is always maintained and upheld. Whether inside or  outside  the\r\n\r\nParliament,  the people have the right to enjoy freedom of speech,  freedom\r\n\r\nof  publication, and freedom of assembly. If the people are  now  satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  the  policies of the Government, then no matter who they  are - whether\r\n\r\nthey  are individuals or political parties or organisations of the  people - the  Party in power invariably allows them to hold mass rallies where  they\r\n\r\ncan  attack and criticise the policies of the Government and publish  their\r\n\r\nviews  against  the Government in the papers. They have  the  privilege  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  fruits  of  the  basic principle of democracy.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\npeople's representatives in Parliament have greater\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfreedom  and they have no restriction whatsoever or run the risk of  being\r\n\r\nprosecuted  or  suspended. They can freely - and very freely indeed - express\r\n\r\nthe  opinions  of the people. Therefore,parliamentary democracy  has  gone\r\n\r\nthrough so many years in England. This only goes to prove that the  people\r\n\r\nhave the full right to enjoy the fruits of parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the organisation of the Legislative Assembly which is constituted in\r\n\r\naccordance    with   the   spirit   of   parliamentary   democracy,    the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people should have the right to  enjoy  democracy. The  contents and the meaning of democracy are that the people should have\r\n\r\nthe  right  to  organise  themselves, to freedom  of  speech,  freedom  of\r\n\r\npublication, and freedom of assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the people of Singapore have no right to such freedom, such as\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  speech  and  freedom of assembly. For  example,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis'  application for a mass rally had been turned down. A Branch  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  held a meeting and they had been  restricted.  Our\r\n\r\ncomrades,  Dr  Lee and Ong Chang Sam, have been charged  in  court  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Fur\r\n\r\nthermore,  if  the  people of Singapore were to go  strongly  against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  then  they  would  be confronted  with  detention  under  the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O.; but we are not afraid of the P.P.S.O. when we struggle  for  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would like to know how the P.P.S.O. comes into the\r\n\r\nPrivileges Bill. I cannot find any reference there to the P.P.S.O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): But we know that the Party in power want\r\n\r\nto  make  use of this Bill in order to prevent us from disclosing the  ins\r\n\r\nand outs of the P.A.P. Government and expressing the views of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to hide their own ugly facts, the P.A.P. Government have to\r\n\r\namend this Bill in order to restrict us in our freedom of speech. There is\r\n\r\na provision in the Bill - clause 20 - which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(1) For any dishonourable conduct, abuse of privilege or contempt, on\r\n\r\nthe part of a member, the Assembly may -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) impose upon him a fine not exceeding the sum of five thousand\r\n\r\ndollars;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) suspend him from the service of the Assembly for the remainder of\r\n\r\nthe current session of the Assembly or\r\n\r\nfor any part thereof;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But  I  am not clear as regards the meaning of this clause. I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhat is the explanation or the definition of \"dishonourable conduct\". I do\r\n\r\nnot understand what is meant by \"dishonourable conduct\" and \"contempt\"  in\r\n\r\nthis Bill. 'May I point out two examples to this House? Firstly, if I  say\r\n\r\nin  this House that the Prime Minister has sold out the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, and, secondly, if I say that the Prime Minister is  a\r\n\r\ndictator, does it mean that the two examples I have quoted will amount  to\r\n\r\ndishonourable conduct on the part of the Assembly Member? If  so,  then  I\r\n\r\nwill  be  running  the  risk of being fined $5,000  by  the  Assembly  and\r\n\r\nsuspended  from  the  service of the Assembly.  Therefore,  where  is  the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  speech  for  the  Members of the  Assembly  in  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all representatives elected by the people. Certainly we have the\r\n\r\nright  to express different views in this House. If our views are  against\r\n\r\nthe opinion and desire of the people, then at the end of the term our fate\r\n\r\nwill  be  decided  by  the  people themselves. Therefore,  this  provision\r\n\r\nregarding \"dishonourable conduct\" is too wide and there is no clear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefinition  for  it. The Party in power in this House may abuse  this  Bill\r\n\r\nand  take  advantage of it against the interests of the Opposition Members.\r\n\r\nIt  seems  there  was  such a case in this House last year.  But  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries  where  parliamentary democracy is practised, there  is  no  such\r\n\r\nserious  provision for the punishment of the representatives of the people.\r\n\r\nIt  is only in Africa where the countries are under colonial rule that  you\r\n\r\ncan  find  such  provisions being made against the representatives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  In  this  way,  the representatives of the  people  appear  to  be\r\n\r\nrepresentatives when, in fact, they are just figure heads in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is a tool which the colonial rulers can make use of to suppress\r\n\r\nthe  freedom of speech of the people's representatives. The representatives\r\n\r\nof  this House are all elected by the people and they have equal rights and\r\n\r\nequal  privileges. It is not up to the Party in power to make use of  their\r\n\r\nextra  vote  to repress the freedom of speech of the Opposition Members  so\r\n\r\nthat  they cannot express the views of the people. If that is the intention\r\n\r\nof  the Party in power and it is attempted, then I will call them dictators\r\n\r\nand enemies of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order.

This shows that\r\n\r\nthe tabling of this Bill aims neither at giving more freedom of speech  to\r\n\r\nMembers, nor a greater sense of security. It is actually meant to  protect\r\n\r\nthe Party in power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should point out at this juncture that the whole aim\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill is to maintain the dignity of the House. I think  that  any\r\n\r\nsteps  taken to protect and maintain the interests of the Members  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly will not be objected to by Members of the Op. position.  But  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is  whether  this Bill, if passed in a  hurry,  will  give  some\r\n\r\nMembers the feeling that, instead of protecting their interests, it  gives\r\n\r\nrise to a sense of insecurity. If that is the case, then the Bill will not\r\n\r\nachieve  its  object. I feel that such a Bill to protect  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse must satisfy every Member so that everyone of us will agree to it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to say that this artificial method to uphold the\r\n\r\ndignity  of  parliamentary democracy is unnecessary, because the  original\r\n\r\nBill,  which was passed in 1955, already provides adequate protection  for\r\n\r\nthe  interests  and  dignity of this House. Now,  in  the  spirit  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  Bill,  the  Assembly is asked to judge Members  of  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nitself as to whether the speeches\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  make are restrained or just delivered anyhow and at random.  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  to judge a Member of the House is definitely not in the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  dignity of the Member himself. If we think further that the Member has\r\n\r\nbeen  elected by the people to the Assembly where he can make his speeches,\r\n\r\nthen  will  he tell lies in this House to smear other people?  If  he  does\r\n\r\nthis, then what will be the impression of the people of his constituency? I\r\n\r\nsay that the electorate themselves will suitably be the judges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that as our Prime Minister is a legal expert,\r\n\r\nsurely  he  knows all points of law. And if members of his Government  make\r\n\r\nmistakes.,  then he will try to look for loopholes in the law in  order  to\r\n\r\ncover  them  up. But Members on the Opposition are quite lacking  in  legal\r\n\r\nknowledge, because there were no opportunities for them to study  law.  And\r\n\r\nso  they  will not be able to bring evidence, as could the Prime  Minister.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they will not be able to disclose abnormal things. If Members of\r\n\r\nthe House, especially those in the Opposition, can bring up some legitimate\r\n\r\ndoubts, although they cannot find legal evidence, then they should be given\r\n\r\nthe  right  of freedom of speech to express them, because we  are  just  be\r\n\r\nginning  to practise parliamentary democracy. We must let Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  have  more freedom to express their views. If I say,  \"I  have  some\r\n\r\ndoubts  regarding  a  Minister and Members of the Government,  and  I  have\r\n\r\ngrounds for these doubts, and I will bring them up in this House\", then  is\r\n\r\nit  not  right  that, with the passing of this Bill, everything  must  have\r\n\r\nlegal standing and be supported by evidence, without which it will be taken\r\n\r\nas  a  smear and mud-slinging? And in this case I will be penalised for  my\r\n\r\ndoubts  and  they  will  be taken as an insult to  Members  of  the  House.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I feel that in the present circumstances when we are practising\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy, Members of this House, especially  those  in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition, should be given more freedom of speech. Apart from this,  there\r\n\r\nis one point which is more important.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there is not so much freedom of speech outside this Assembly, Members\r\n\r\nof this House should be given more freedom of speech in the House in order\r\n\r\nto  make  up for such a lack of freedom of speech. In short, to depend  on\r\n\r\nthis Bill to uphold the dignity of this House is not an ideal way of doing\r\n\r\nthings.  The  main  thing  is  that the  maintenance  of  dignity  of  the\r\n\r\nParliament  should depend on the Government itself, which  should  find  a\r\n\r\nbrighter  future  for its people. If the Government, on greater  policies,\r\n\r\nsell out the interests of the people and the country itself -\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not want this debate to go round wandering into\r\n\r\nthe  policies  of the Government. We are now debating the Privileges  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  affects Assemblymen.

What I mean\r\n\r\nto  say is that if the policies of the Government do not get on well  with\r\n\r\nthe  people,  then  this Bill will not bring dignity to the  Assembly.  By\r\n\r\npassing  this  Bill, the Government hopes to uphold the  dignity  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  But  if the people do. not understand the dignity of a  nation  or\r\n\r\ncountry, or uphold such dignity, then the Government should not depend  on\r\n\r\nthis Bill alone to uphold the dignity of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the statement of the Prime Minister that this Bill will be\r\n\r\nreferred to a Select Committee for its consideration. I feel that that  is\r\n\r\na  plausible way of doing things on the part of the Prime Minister. I hope\r\n\r\nthat  in future the Government will not pass such a Bill right through  at\r\n\r\none sitting.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nin  moving  the  Second Reading of the Bill did not give reasons  why  the\r\n\r\nBill  should  be carried through all its stages at this sitting.  But  the\r\n\r\nHon.  the  Prime Minister was stirred into rising on his feet and replying\r\n\r\nto  the  attacks that have been made by his ex-comrades. He said that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprepared  to  refer the Bill to a Select Committee. But  when  he  conceded\r\n\r\nthat, I must point out to him the fact that he had said he was prepared  to\r\n\r\nfight  according to Queensberry rules or Siamese rules shows that there  is\r\n\r\nalready a tension on that side of the House and this side of the House.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember last year, the time when the Member for Hong Lim was\r\n\r\nindulging  in his attacks against the Government. Members of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis were on that side of the House.\r\n\r\nThey  were  then so roused that each and every one of them  stood  up  and\r\n\r\nattacked  the  hon.  Member for Hong Lim for such conduct  which  they  de\r\n\r\nscribed  then as dishonourable. Sir, all I can say is that people who  are\r\n\r\non  this  side  and who came from that side might adopt the same  kind  of\r\n\r\ntraining  when they now know that the gloves are off - fight to  the  death.\r\n\r\nQueensberry rules or Siamese rules - and both sides are waiting to have that\r\n\r\nfight.  But  we,  Sir, who happen to be on the Front  Bench - and  you,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, for whom I have every sympathy because in the days  to  come\r\n\r\nthese  sittings  may be very protracted - we are going to be  treated  to  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of exchanges between ex-comrades on what they did, what  they  did\r\n\r\nnot  do. and for all we know, there might even be pertain confessions from\r\n\r\nthose  who  left the P.A.P. in reply to the ugly confessions of the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in his radio broadcasts. I hope we will not be treated  to  that\r\n\r\nkind of confessions which, in a way, are not helpful and beneficial to the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people and do not uphold the dignity of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the principle of the Bill. We say that the dignity of the\r\n\r\nHouse  must  be  upheld at any price. And we who are proud  to  be  called\r\n\r\nhonourable  men  and women of this Assembly must impose upon  ourselves  a\r\n\r\ncertain code of conduct -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

That is all  beside  the\r\n\r\npoint, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were treated to a sad display of conduct that did not bring credit to\r\n\r\nthis  House  and  to each and every one of us who were here  last  Session.\r\n\r\nSome  of us felt very, very unhappy that hon.

For instance, if a Member  tables  an  untrue\r\n\r\ndocument or says something untrue in this Assembly, it might very well  be\r\n\r\nthat  he  might  have meant well when he said such things,  but  it  might\r\n\r\nconsequently be found that they were not very true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will bear with me, Sir, the practice of parliamentary democracy,\r\n\r\nespecially  with benches on different sides, implies that  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers must always keep an alert eye on the Government. If at any time  a\r\n\r\nMember of the Opposition should smell a rat in the Government it is up to\r\n\r\nhim  to  use  his very long nose to smell out and to smoke out  that  rat.\r\n\r\nSometimes  hints given to him may be true and well-founded  but  sometimes\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily so, because we on this side of the Assembly do  not  have\r\n\r\naccess  to information that is available to Members of the Government.  It\r\n\r\nis,  therefore,  on this principle that the Bill should be very  carefully\r\n\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, may I sympathise with the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill for being in the position where he is now -facing the  Opposition,  and  therefore,  knowing very well what  is  going  on.  But  he  is\r\n\r\nsandwiched  in  between  Members who claim  that  they  do  not  know  what\r\n\r\nhonourable or dishonourable conduct is. The impression is given  that  this\r\n\r\nPrivileges Bill is designed to curtail freedom of speech. It is  only  fair\r\n\r\nthat  I  should at least give an indication of what it really seeks to  do.\r\n\r\nFor example - among offences - it says that it will be an offence to threaten\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor send a threatening letter to the Speaker, or publish any statement,\r\n\r\nwhether in writing or otherwise, which falsely or scandalously defames,\r\n\r\nwhich reflects on the character of the Speaker or any Member touching on\r\n\r\nhis conduct in the Assembly, and so on. The general impression given in\r\n\r\nsome of the speeches made by Members of the Barisan Sosialis is that this\r\n\r\nBill seeks to curtail freedom of speech. In fact, as far as I know, since\r\n\r\nwe have been here for a couple of days, not one of the Members in this\r\n\r\nAssembly has felt constrained to limit what he has to say because of fear\r\n\r\nthat the Government with its powers might curb him or otherwise deal with\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Bill is not passed yet.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member for Upper Serangoon has suggested that he\r\n\r\ndoes  not know what honourable or dishonourable conduct is, or what  truth\r\n\r\nor  falsehood  is.  But I think most of us in this Assembly  can,  by  and\r\n\r\nlarge,  determine  what  is  truth and what is  falsehood.  Therefore,  in\r\n\r\npassing  this  Bill,  we are only ensuring that the  normal  standards  of\r\n\r\nhonourable  conduct, the normal standards of what is  true  or  false  are\r\n\r\nobserved  in  this Assembly. If certain Members feel that  they  would  be\r\n\r\nsomehow  curbed or restrained in this respect, I think that  is  a  matter\r\n\r\nwhich they can bring up before the Select Committee, where they can define\r\n\r\nwhat their standards of honour, truth and falsehood are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Toh, in reply?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, it is an irony that sometime early this\r\n\r\nyear,  13 Members from the Barisan Sosialis were sitting on this  side  of\r\n\r\nthe House.  At that time they knew what was the meaning of dishonourable\r\n\r\nconduct.  In  fact,  they  did agree that the  Member  for  Hong  Lim  had\r\n\r\ncommitted a breach of privilege. Now, the Member for Queenstown has led 12\r\n\r\nof  his other colleagues to a snake dance, twisting and turning round over\r\n\r\nto the other side -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Members of the House\r\n\r\nwill  remember  that the Member for Hong Lim had to face  a  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry sometime in June of this year, if my memory is correct. He faced  a\r\n\r\nJudge  from  the  High Court, and the verdict of the  Judge  was  that  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim had told lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am wondering whether this is all relevant to the\r\n\r\nBill.  I  cannot see any relevance at all. This refers to what has happened\r\n\r\nin the past. We are now legislating, I hope, for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Actually, Mr Speaker, it is because we are\r\n\r\nlegislating for the future that we have to look up precedents in the  past.\r\n\r\nThere  was  one particular point which the Member for Hong Lim  brought  up\r\n\r\nand  which  the Member for Pasir Panjang has also brought up, namely,  that\r\n\r\none  of  the  punishments for breach of privilege, a  fine  of  $5,000,  as\r\n\r\nstated  in  this Bill, was too heavy. But I would like to refer Members  of\r\n\r\nthe House a case where the former -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister has\r\n\r\ndrawn  attention to the fact that on this side of the House,  Members  were\r\n\r\nspeaking in detail. May I take the liberty, Sir, of asking you whether  the\r\n\r\nmatter  in  respect of which the Deputy Premier is now speaking is  not  in\r\n\r\ndetail?

And that was  the  question  of  the\r\n\r\npunitive powers which the Assembly has. I was going to refer to a case  in\r\n\r\nwhich a former Assemblyman, Mr Lim Cher Kheng, was a plaintiff in a libel\r\n\r\nsuit,  and  he  was  awarded damages to the extent of  $13,000  against  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper.  That, I think, should answer the doubts raised by  Members  on\r\n\r\nthe  opposite side. However, all I would like to say now, Mr Speaker,  is\r\n\r\nthat  since we have agreed to refer this Bill for discussion in detail  in\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee, I would add that, in doing so, it is on  the  provision\r\n\r\nthat this Bill will be made retrospective from the day it was introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and\r\n\r\nseven other Members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection.-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now adjourn.\"-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty-eight minutes to Nine o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><div align=\"center\"><i>Friday, 17th November, 1961</i></div><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital Crimes\r\n\r\n                              \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the\r\n\r\nnumber of persons between the ages of 18 and 21 convicted of capital crimes\r\n\r\nfor  each of the years 1955 to 1960, and for the first ten months of  1961;\r\n\r\n(b) the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber  of  such persons who the Minister is satisfied were secret  society\r\n\r\nmembers;  (c)  the  number  of such persons who  were  not  secret  society\r\n\r\nmembers; and (d) the number of such persons who were secret society members\r\n\r\nand were executed.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The information sought by the Member for Anson is\r\n\r\ngiven in the following table:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                                                                          Jan.\r\n\r\n                                                                          to\r\n\r\n                                                                          Oct.\r\n\r\n                                      1955  1956  1957  1958  1959  1960  1961  Total\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n (a) Number of persons\r\n\r\n      between 18 years and \r\n\r\n      21 years convicted of \r\n\r\n      capital crimes                    1     1     -     1     3     -     1     7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n (b) Number of (a) who were known \r\n\r\n      Secret Society members            1     1     -     1     3     -     1     7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n (c) Number of (a) who were not known \r\n\r\n      to be Secret Society members      -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n (d) Number of (b) who were executed    -     1     -     -     -     -     -     1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
