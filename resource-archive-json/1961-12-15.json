This  is\r\n\r\nquite  a  large  investment. As I said yesterday,  this\r\n\r\ncompany has employed only one new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworker. In principle, we do not oppose the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  and  the Economic Development Board  in  their\r\n\r\neffort  to promote industrialisation in Singapore,  but\r\n\r\nwe  are  doubtful about its success because  the  Shell\r\n\r\nCompany has only engaged one new worker. In view of the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the Assembly has been asked to approve  $20\r\n\r\nmillion  for 1962, we must be very careful to ascertain\r\n\r\nwhether  the  desired  results  can  be  achieved.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance has given pioneer status  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod of five years to promote new industries. Let  us\r\n\r\ntake  the  example of Shell Company which  has  engaged\r\n\r\nonly  one  new worker after the investment of  the  so-called  $10  million. This shows that the  unemployment\r\n\r\nsituation  in Singapore has not been improved  and  the\r\n\r\nproblem has not been solved. The company invested  such\r\n\r\na  large sum of capital and it obtained pioneer  status\r\n\r\nfor  five  years.  This has been a great  loss  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  because  the  company  has   not\r\n\r\ncontributed   anything   to   the   solution   of   the\r\n\r\nunemployment problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether other new\r\n\r\nindustrialists  seeking investment and  pioneer  status\r\n\r\nfor their industries will be allowed to follow the same\r\n\r\nfootsteps  of the Shell Company. If such is  the  case,\r\n\r\nthen it is very regrettable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investment of $10 million by the Shell Company\r\n\r\nhas   not   contributed  anything  to  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  From this fact alone, we can see  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  not receive any taxation  from  these\r\n\r\nindustries for some time and, generally speaking,  this\r\n\r\nis  a  great loss to our country. I will use a  Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying  to  describe  what  advantages  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will derive from such industries.  It  is  a\r\n\r\ndouble  loss.  Not only do you lose your wife  but  you\r\n\r\nalso incur defeat through a military manoeuvre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will look into this question and\r\n\r\nreview  its policy so that pioneer industries  and  new\r\n\r\ninvestments will help solve the unemployment problem in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for 2 \u00bd\r\n\r\nyears, we have been listening to the Government talking\r\n\r\nabout economic development and industrialisation. What\r\n\r\nhas the Government done? Almost nothing. What it has\r\n\r\ndone is to change the name of the Industrial Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard to the Economic Development Board. What is the\r\n\r\nuse of a change in name? The people want jobs and not a\r\n\r\nchange of name. The failure of the Government in its so-called industrialisation plan is partly due to a lack\r\n\r\nof personnel with practical experience. If the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Finance and the Industrial Promotion Board had been\r\n\r\nstaffed with people of practical experience instead of\r\n\r\narmchair economists and paper-flappers, I think the\r\n\r\nposition today would have been much better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not depend entirely on foreign\r\n\r\nindustrial missions. They are sometimes useful, but how\r\n\r\ncan we expect them to do marvelous things by spending a\r\n\r\nfew weeks here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I trust the Member for Aljunied is not\r\n\r\nreading from a script.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> He is\r\n\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we can form industrial\r\n\r\nadvisory   boards  composed  of  local   industrialists\r\n\r\ninstead of depending on foreign industrial missions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main emphasis on\r\n\r\nindustrialisation should be on medium and  small  scale\r\n\r\nindustries.  The  Government should undertake  research\r\n\r\ninto the types of products that can be manufactured  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  readily  supply  such  information   to\r\n\r\ninterested   parties.  The  Government   should   relax\r\n\r\nimmigration    controls   and   allow    people    with\r\n\r\nmanufacturing experience to come in and invest or  work\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister to make a ministerial statement at\r\n\r\nsome future date on his industrial programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, after\r\n\r\nthe debate on the last Budget, I remember reading in\r\n\r\nthe newspapers of Government's plan to start a steel\r\n\r\nmill with a capital of $50 million. What I want to ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister is this. Of the $50 million authorised on\r\n\r\nnominal capital, how much would be paid up? It would\r\n\r\nnot be useful if only $500,000 or $5 million of the $50\r\n\r\nmillion is paid up. It strikes me that this so-called\r\n\r\nsteel mill is not a steel mill. It is just like one of\r\n\r\nthose factories which pull out steel bars and steel\r\n\r\nplates; from local scrap iron. We have such a factory\r\n\r\nin Bukit Timah Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems to me that the particular person who is\r\n\r\ngoing to form this supposed steel mill has already  got\r\n\r\nanother concession from the Government by obtaining $ \u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion loan. From what I see of the activities, of the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Promotion Board and the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard,  it  seems  they  are all  centred  around  this\r\n\r\nperson.  Is  it because there are no other  persons  in\r\n\r\nSingapore who have applied for similar loans,  or  that\r\n\r\ntheir  applications were not substantiated with  enough\r\n\r\nfacts  to  obtain  the loans, or is  it  because  their\r\n\r\nschemes  were  not  practicable?  But  what  I   cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand is that two schemes - I have only  been  able\r\n\r\nto  see  two schemes - have been taken over by  the  same\r\n\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, these are doubts in my mind\r\n\r\nwhich I hope the Minister will be able to clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu  Kang  made the point that  since  the  Shell\r\n\r\nrefinery at Pulau Bukom could give employment  to  only\r\n\r\none  new  employee, that project, into which more  than\r\n\r\n$10 million worth of capital has been sunk, did nothing\r\n\r\nto  solve the unemployment problem in Singapore.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot   know  from  this  whether  one  could  infer  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that  this  project should  not  have  been\r\n\r\nproceeded with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  do  not think that is the point that the Member  was\r\n\r\ntrying  to  make. If indeed it was,  I  say  it  is  an\r\n\r\nextremely foolish conclusion to come to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the refining industry is what the economists\r\n\r\ncall   a  \"capital  intensive\"  industry,  indeed  most\r\n\r\nindustries   connected  with  any  form   of   chemical\r\n\r\noperations  require a lot of capital as  compared  with\r\n\r\nlabour.  In  the  nature of things,  that  is  the  way\r\n\r\nproduction  processes  are made.  It  is  not  correct,\r\n\r\nhowever, to say that the oil refinery just gives a  job\r\n\r\nto  one  person. That is a completely distorted way  of\r\n\r\nrepresenting the position. The refinery gives  jobs  to\r\n\r\nmore than 70 persons, most of whom were already in  the\r\n\r\nemployment  of  Shell Company. But the  Shell  Company,\r\n\r\nthrough  modernisation of its organisation,  has  found\r\n\r\nthat  there may be some 200 workers redundant. And this\r\n\r\nis in the nature of things. Every industry is trying to\r\n\r\nimprove  its  methods of production;  productivity  per\r\n\r\nworker  increases.  And., therefore,  unless  there  is\r\n\r\nscope for expansion, you will find the labour force  of\r\n\r\nyour existing industry getting smaller and smaller.  By\r\n\r\nestablishing this oil refinery, the Shell  Company  has\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  give jobs to more than 70  workers  who\r\n\r\notherwise  might have been retrenched.  Further,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  refining operations, they will  branch  out\r\n\r\ninto  other lines. I believe they are now contemplating\r\n\r\nthe  manufacture of pitch tar, which will require  them\r\n\r\nto  start a new factory to make drums for the packaging\r\n\r\nof  this product. So once you have a major industry, it\r\n\r\ngenerates  employment by creating a secondary  industry\r\n\r\nlinked  up  with it. That is why, when we  discuss  the\r\n\r\ntotal effects of any new industrial project, we have to\r\n\r\ntake  into  account  all  the  repercussions  that  the\r\n\r\nproject leads to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied claims that the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  is merely the Industrial  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard  under  a  new  name. Sir,  I  have  on  previous\r\n\r\noccasions dealt at great length with the steps taken to\r\n\r\nstart  the  Economic.  Development  Board;  the  expert\r\n\r\npersonnel recruited from abroad,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  extra  new  staff of economic engineers  recruited\r\n\r\nfrom  local  sources,  and the additional  $40  million\r\n\r\nworth  of capital which the Economic Development  Board\r\n\r\nhas  and  which the Industrial Promotion Board did  not\r\n\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I recapitulate some of the things said of the\r\n\r\nEconomic   Development  Board?  We  have  recruited   a\r\n\r\ndirector who is a top-ranking economic planner  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Israel.  We  have  a  former  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary  in my Ministry as Chairman of the Board.  We\r\n\r\nhave  two  young  civil servants and  one  young  local\r\n\r\nengineer  to be in the promotion and technical branches\r\n\r\nof  this Board. We are also recruiting some five to six\r\n\r\nexperts  through the United Nations and they should  be\r\n\r\nhere by about April next year at the latest. These  are\r\n\r\nexperts   in   various   fields,   such   as   chemical\r\n\r\nengineering, industrial cost accounting, and so on.  At\r\n\r\nthe same time, the Industrial Research Unit will be set\r\n\r\nup by the first quarter of next year. This Unit will be\r\n\r\nable  to give technical and production advice to  small\r\n\r\nand medium scale local industries. To say that this is\r\n\r\njust the Industrial Promotion Board under a new name is\r\n\r\nabsolute nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem that we are facing - let me repeat - is a\r\n\r\nmost  dangerous  one.  The Member  for  Choa  Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nbrought  up the point which allows me to bring out  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  if  in Singapore there is no  expansion  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  output, that does not mean that the  number\r\n\r\nof  workers  will remain at the present level,  because\r\n\r\ntechniques  of  production are always  improving.  With\r\n\r\nimproved methods, more machines are used and the labour\r\n\r\nforce  becomes smaller. And that is going  on  all  the\r\n\r\ntime. The United Nations mission calculated that within\r\n\r\nthe  next  ten years some 12,000 workers would  not  be\r\n\r\nrequired  in  existing industries because of  increased\r\n\r\nproductivity   and   because  of  better   methods   of\r\n\r\nproduction;  just  to maintain the  existing  level  of\r\n\r\noutput,  quite  apart from giving new  jobs  to  people\r\n\r\nlooking  for work. We have to find jobs for people  who\r\n\r\nwould\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  redundant because improved techniques of production\r\n\r\nare introduced in our industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members did say that we have announced our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  plans in general  terms.  They  say,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  what  are  the actual industries  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  has  in  mind  to  assist  and   to\r\n\r\npromote?\"  This is the final test. It is no use  saying\r\n\r\nchemical  industries or metal industries or  what  have\r\n\r\nyou.  The United Nations industrial mission has made  a\r\n\r\nnumber     of    specific    recommendations.     These\r\n\r\nrecommendations are being studied by the staff  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board. Contacts  are  being  made\r\n\r\nwith local and foreign industrialists interested in pro\r\n\r\nducing  the goods recommended. There are to date  three\r\n\r\nmajor  fields that have been examined by this  mission.\r\n\r\nThey  are, briefly, metal and engineering, where it  is\r\n\r\nexpected that an investment of $5 million could be made\r\n\r\nin  Singapore in various industries which  will  create\r\n\r\njobs   for   200   people.  The   specific   industries\r\n\r\nrecommended   are   as   follows:   under   metal   and\r\n\r\nengineering - production    of    abrasives,    bicycles,\r\n\r\nbuilding, hardware, galvanishing of iron sheets,  metal\r\n\r\nfurniture  for  home use, steel bolts and  nuts,  steel\r\n\r\nwire rods, steel wire nails, steel wire netting, welded\r\n\r\nsteel tubing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under electrical equipment and appliances, 32\r\n\r\nproducts have been recommended for immediate production\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  They  involve an  investment  of  $13.5\r\n\r\nmillion  and  would create employment for  about  1,400\r\n\r\npersons in the initial stages. The products recommended\r\n\r\nare  as  follows: - fluorescent light fittings,  domestic\r\n\r\nplugs  and socket outlets, switch gears and flat irons,\r\n\r\nmotors  and  fans, accumulators, chokes,  transformers,\r\n\r\nrefrigerators,  cookers, radios, television,  insulated\r\n\r\ncables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the chemical industries, a $26 million\r\n\r\ninvestment  would  be justified in creating  employment\r\n\r\nfor  some  3,000  people. The products  that  could  be\r\n\r\nproduced in Singapore, according to the mission, are as\r\n\r\nfollows:-   insecticides  and   disinfectants,   rubber\r\n\r\nprocessing,    plastics   industries,    paints,    oil\r\n\r\nprocessing, pineapple industry, soya\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbean  processing,  wheat mix, urban  garbage  disposal,\r\n\r\nsulphuric   acid   and  aluminium   sulphate,   storage\r\n\r\nbatteries,   fire   extinguishers,  ceramics,   certain\r\n\r\ncategories of pharmaceuticals, cement, calcium carbide,\r\n\r\nalcohol  distillation  plant,  foam  plastics,  washing\r\n\r\npowders, detergents and blues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there are a number of priority industries\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Economic Development Board  is  anxious  to\r\n\r\npromote. These have been studied in some detail and the\r\n\r\nBoard, as I have stated before, is making contact  with\r\n\r\nlocal and foreign manufacturers who may want to produce\r\n\r\nthem.   The   Board   is  prepared  to   assist   these\r\n\r\nindustrialists with all the resources at its  disposal.\r\n\r\nThe industries are, of course, first, the rolling steel\r\n\r\nmill which is in the course of construction; production\r\n\r\nof  window  panes, pans, rattan furniture, noodles  and\r\n\r\nbeehoon,  woodwaste  utilisation,  reinforced  plastics\r\n\r\nworkshop,  oil  refining, sulphuric  acid,  detergents,\r\n\r\nmatches,   wheat   mix,  fruit  juice  canning,   jams,\r\n\r\nsausages,  and  fish  curing.  So,  you  can  see,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that we have moved away from the stage of\r\n\r\njust  framing a general policy and are going  into  the\r\n\r\nrealm  of  actual project evaluation,  actual  work  in\r\n\r\npromoting  specific  industries for  which  details  of\r\n\r\nmarketing  costs, techniques of production and  so  on,\r\n\r\nhave been worked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the steel mill, the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nthinks  that the Economic Development Board is  staffed\r\n\r\nby  people  whose  only experience is  selling  kachang\r\n\r\nputeh.

The\r\n\r\nreason  why I brought up the United Nations mission  is\r\n\r\nthat  this  steel mill which we are putting  up  is  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  their recommendation.  Briefly,  they\r\n\r\nrecommended that a steel industry could be developed in\r\n\r\nthree   stages.   The   first  stage   would   be   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  a mill for smelting  scrap,  rolling\r\n\r\nsteel  ingots, re-rolling of ship scrap, with an output\r\n\r\nof  30,000  tons  a year which could  be  increased  to\r\n\r\n60,000  tons eventually. This is the industrial project\r\n\r\nwhich  is  now  being carried out by a group  of  local\r\n\r\nbusinessmen and the Economic Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim made certain statements which\r\n\r\nhinted   rather  darkly  that  the  Board  is   showing\r\n\r\nfavouritism  to a particular person. For  instance,  we\r\n\r\nare  lending this person half a million dollars for the\r\n\r\nsteel project. I can assure you, Mr Speaker. Sir, that\r\n\r\nthis is completely untrue. I do not know whether he has\r\n\r\nin  mind  the loan for ship-breakers. The ship-breaking\r\n\r\nfirm,  or  the  person interested in ship-breaking  who\r\n\r\ncarries  out  ship-breaking, who has a  loan  from  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard, is also a partner in the steel mill. But  he  is\r\n\r\nby  no  means  a  major partner. He is rather  a  minor\r\n\r\npartner in the project. The main capital comes  from  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of  wealthy  businessmen who are  putting  their\r\n\r\nmoney  into it. The paid-up capital in the first  stage\r\n\r\nis $6.5 million.

That is repetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will give my\r\n\r\nview  on  this oil refinery. The Shell Company have  to\r\n\r\nestablish  an  oil  refinery  in  Singapore  because  a\r\n\r\nJapanese  oil  refinery has been  established.  If  the\r\n\r\nShell  Company  do not establish one, they  are  in  no\r\n\r\nposition to compete with the Marusan Toyo Company which\r\n\r\nhas  established one at Telok Blangah. Sir, my view  is\r\n\r\nthat  there is no need to give tax exemption  for  five\r\n\r\nyears  to  this Shell Refinery. If we want to give  tax\r\n\r\nexemption,   we   should  give  it   to   more   worthy\r\n\r\nenterprises. I am sure there are many who have  applied\r\n\r\nfor pioneer status and tax exemption, because they have\r\n\r\nto come into the market here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise, they are in no position to compete. Once  we\r\n\r\ngive  tax  exemption  to the Shell Refinery,  they  can\r\n\r\nnegotiate  or arrange among themselves. I do  not  mean\r\n\r\nthat they necessarily did. But I say they can have made\r\n\r\narrangements among the Shell Group. There are three  or\r\n\r\nfour Shell companies in Singapore. One is exempted from\r\n\r\ntax; the profits are exempted from tax. The others  are\r\n\r\nnot.  They  can sell at the highest price. Suppose  the\r\n\r\noil refinery produces oil at $10 per ton and the market\r\n\r\nprice  is $30 per ton. This refinery can sell at $29.99\r\n\r\nto  the  Company which has to pay tax, for  the  simple\r\n\r\nreason  that  the  refinery which makes  $19.99  a  ton\r\n\r\nprofit  does not have to pay income tax for five years.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I think that is what the Member  for\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu  Kang was trying to drive at and the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance should clarify this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, that was not the\r\n\r\npoint  the  Member for Choa Chu Kang  was  driving  at.\r\n\r\nalthough  he  nodded  his  head  very  wisely  when  an\r\n\r\naccountant  made  the point, which is  supposed  to  be\r\n\r\nquite telling. The answer is quite simple, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.  Surely  we  are not suckers. The  Government  has\r\n\r\nincome  tax  experts and accountants. In the  agreement\r\n\r\nwhich we signed with the Shell Company, this point  was\r\n\r\ndescribed  in  minute detail, not merely  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nproduction  and  selling  cost  but  also  finally  the\r\n\r\ndistributing services. Also more important,  the  price\r\n\r\nat  which they buy from outside and the price at, which\r\n\r\nthey   sell   to  their  distributing  agents   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.  All these matters have been  gone  into  in\r\n\r\ngreat  detail.  There are no loopholes for  Shell.  The\r\n\r\nanswer  is  quite simple. If you say you  do  not  give\r\n\r\npioneer status to Shell, there is a bigger refinery in\r\n\r\nthe Federation if you do not have one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Just one line, Sir.

In the second column, Revised Plan  Cost\r\n\r\nis $45 million. If I may refer to the Development Plan\r\n\r\nfor 1961/64, at page 73, paragraph 7.62:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The total cost of the new town can only be estimated\r\n\r\nafter   detailed  geological  and  other  surveys.   A\r\n\r\nprovisional  sum  of  $45 million has  been  allocated\r\n\r\nwhich will be supplemented as development progresses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that the total cost of these estates is not\r\n\r\nyet  known to the Government, that this is merely  the\r\n\r\nfirst   instalment  in  the  project,  and  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  revised  plan on  the  first  instalment\r\n\r\nstill  remains the same at $45 million, of  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment hopes to spend $600,000 by the end of  this\r\n\r\nyear.  The  estimated expenditure for  1962  is  $20.4\r\n\r\nmillion  and  the  amount  required  to  complete  the\r\n\r\nproject,  i.e., the first phase of it, is another  $24\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Hon, the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  first  spoke to the House  about  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nproject, I get the impression from him that the  whole\r\n\r\nof  this scheme was attuned to the steel mill that was\r\n\r\nto  be  established in that area, that the steel  mill\r\n\r\nwas   going  to  be  the  focal  point  around   which\r\n\r\nsubsidiary industries were to be established, and that\r\n\r\nthis  $45  million  which the Government  proposes  to\r\n\r\nspend initially is to be spent on items which normally\r\n\r\na  government or a State would spend in order  to  put\r\n\r\nthe  site ready for private enterprise to come in  and\r\n\r\ndevelop it. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake  it  that it is correct this $45 million does  not\r\n\r\ninclude the cost of establishing the steel mill itself.\r\n\r\nCould the Minister tell us whether the Government still\r\n\r\nholds  the  view that the focal point of the industrial\r\n\r\nestates in the Jurong project is still the steel  mill,\r\n\r\nand whether Government hopes that private industry will\r\n\r\nthen   cluster  around  this  steel  mill  on   objects\r\n\r\nsubsidiary to it? That is the first point, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is whether the Government has made\r\n\r\nany progress in the establishment of the steel mill and\r\n\r\nwhat  aid  the Economic Development Board is  going  to\r\n\r\ngive  to  any  person or persons who wish to  establish\r\n\r\nthis steel mill; and whether the Minister is now in the\r\n\r\nposition to give definite information to this House  as\r\n\r\nto  what  exactly is going on in Jurong? The Government\r\n\r\nhas  estimated that they will spend $600,000 at the end\r\n\r\nof  this  year under subhead 4. Under subhead  6,  Sir,\r\n\r\nland  acquisition for industrialisation  at  Jurong,  I\r\n\r\ntake it, is $5 million of which $4.3 million has already\r\n\r\nbeen  spent.  So by that, I assume that  all  the  land\r\n\r\nwhich  the Government hopes to acquire in that vicinity\r\n\r\nhas  been acquired and possibly' paid for. So that over\r\n\r\nand  above  that they are now hoping lb spend $600,000.\r\n\r\nCould  the Minister tell the House exactly on  what  he\r\n\r\nhas spent this sum .of money whether it is on levelling\r\n\r\nthe hills and filling the land there? The Minister also\r\n\r\nmade  a  statement,  Sir, a few minutes  ago  that  the\r\n\r\nJurong  steel project is in the course of  erection.  I\r\n\r\ndefinitely heard him say that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Construction. Did the Minister mean by\r\n\r\nthat  that  the walls of the steel mill are  going  up;\r\n\r\nthat  the  site  is being filled in, and  did  he  mean\r\n\r\nconstruction  by that? Or was it just  a  slip  of  the\r\n\r\ntongue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The point has already been raised,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Dealing with the last point first.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  said  the steel mill is under construction,  I\r\n\r\nmeant two things. First, the site has now been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlevelled;  second,  members of the Board  of  Directors\r\n\r\nhave gone abroad to order the equipment. The design  of\r\n\r\nthe  mill  itself has been made by the  United  Nations\r\n\r\nMission.   If  all  goes  well,  the  mill  should   be\r\n\r\nestablished either at the end of next year or early  in\r\n\r\n1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the steel mill will be the focal point of the\r\n\r\nwhole Jurong industrial project is something of which I\r\n\r\nam  afraid we have to make a reappraisal. Our  original\r\n\r\nplan was to start a mill on a very substantial scale in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with  Japanese steel mill  interests.  But\r\n\r\nboth  the United Nations Steel Mission and the Japanese\r\n\r\nexperts themselves formed the view that we could do  it\r\n\r\nin three stages, starting with a small smelting rolling\r\n\r\nmill,  and  it production problems have been  overcome,\r\n\r\nmarkets  established,  then the  question  of  eventual\r\n\r\nextension to the real thing, i.e., the mill, plant  and\r\n\r\nfurnaces. That could be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, aid to the mill. As I have said, this venture is\r\n\r\na  venture  of  local  businessmen.  They  put  up  the\r\n\r\ncapital. The Economic Development Board itself is  just\r\n\r\nproviding,  I think, a small minority share,  something\r\n\r\nlike  15  to  20 per cent of the capital - no  more  than\r\n\r\nthat.  They  are just appointing some two Directors  to\r\n\r\nthe Board of Directors of this enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the works in Jurong at present - I think I\r\n\r\nreported  this  rather briefly in my Budget  Statement;\r\n\r\nperhaps   there   could  be  just   some   repetition - a\r\n\r\nconsiderable amount of earthworks are in progress. That\r\n\r\npart of Jurong is fairly hilly and hills have just been\r\n\r\nlevelled;  swamps have to be filled; roads have  to  be\r\n\r\nconstructed.  So at present, the works currently  going\r\n\r\non   are   levelling  of  hills,  filling  of   swamps,\r\n\r\nconstruction  of roads and also the construction  of  a\r\n\r\nculvert on the eastern shore of the Jurong River.  This\r\n\r\nis  necessary because a causeway will be built over the\r\n\r\nJurong River which will dam the northern reaches of the\r\n\r\nriver  and  turn  it  into a reservoir  for  industrial\r\n\r\nwater. Then that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncauseway will, at the same time, provide communications\r\n\r\nbetween  the Jurong industrial estates and the port  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  through Ayer Rajah Road. That  part  of  the\r\n\r\nwork  of building roads and the causeway together  with\r\n\r\nthe  industrial  water reservoir is in  progress.  Also\r\n\r\nelectrical supplies are being stepped up. We hope  also\r\n\r\nto  provide an adequate supply of water. But this is in\r\n\r\nsome  doubt  now.  I  am  not sure  whether  the  Water\r\n\r\nDepartment could move fast enough to provide sufficient\r\n\r\nwater, at any rate, by the first half of next year. The\r\n\r\nposition of electricity seems to be all right.  But  as\r\n\r\nregards  piped water, I think they are somewhat  behind\r\n\r\ntime. Now, if Members are interested in seeing what  is\r\n\r\ngoing on in Jurong, the Government will be very pleased\r\n\r\nto  arrange touring parties for them to have a look.  I\r\n\r\nthink it is worth a visit because the amount of work in\r\n\r\nprogress  there  is quite substantial and  will  go  on\r\n\r\nincreasing in the next year or two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Minister did say that the\r\n\r\nparticipation of the Economic Development Board in this\r\n\r\nproject is, I believe, to the extent of 20 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe shares.

The Jurong project seems to be  fairly\r\n\r\nhealthy.  If we could only get water, I think  we  will\r\n\r\nget  it  squeaking  and  squawking.  But  Kallang  Land\r\n\r\nReclamation,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, seems  to  be  in  the\r\n\r\ndoldrums.  In the original scheme, as you  will  notice\r\n\r\nfrom col. 1, it was $43.124 million, and if you will be\r\n\r\ngood  enough to look again at the 1961-1964 Development\r\n\r\nPlan,  page  70, paragraph 7.44, we have a split-up  of\r\n\r\nthe $43.124 million:\r\n\r\n<pre> \r\n\r\n                                               $\r\n\r\nConstruction of approach road from quarry   2,130,000\r\n\r\nPreparation of polders and pumping          1,984,000\r\n\r\nFilling                                    30,000,000\r\n\r\nDredging Channels                           1,660,000\r\n\r\nSheet piles and river walls for channels    7,000,000\r\n\r\nSurveys, Supervison and Clerical              350,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, what is more interesting is paragraph 7.45, Mr Speaker, Sir:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the total is taken as $50 million, so as to include contingencies. .'.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the people who planned this felt that $43 million would not be\r\n\r\nenough to be on the safe side to include contingencies. They thought that $50\r\n\r\nmillion was nearer the mark. That was when this plan was published sometime in April or May\r\n\r\nthis year. But within six months Kallang Land Reclamation has dropped from near $50 million \r\n\r\nto $28.50 million. Perhaps the Minister might tell us how this reduction in cost has been affected;\r\n\r\nwhether the area of development is going to be reduced from 1,035 acres to half, or what the \r\n\r\nposition there is. So far as this year is concerned, Sir, there is no expenditure of money.\r\n\r\nBut for the year 1962, they estimate that they will be spending half a million dollars. Now,\r\n\r\nunder either of these headings, it seems to me that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  thing  they  are going to do there next year would appear  to  be  on\r\n\r\nSurveys, Supervision and Clerical, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Kallang Land Reclamation project has indeed\r\n\r\nhit  a  number of snags. Altogether we have been most unfortunate  in  this\r\n\r\nbusiness.  As  regards the change from $50 million to some $28  million,  I\r\n\r\nthink  there were two schemes to fill up this swamp. One is by moving earth\r\n\r\nfrom  Paya  Lebar, and the other is by pumping mud from the  sea.  And  the\r\n\r\ncheaper  one  is  this one. As regards progress, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  did\r\n\r\nreport  to the House that we have written to the Government of West Germany\r\n\r\nfor  technical assistance. We have not had any reply. In the  meantime,  we\r\n\r\nhave  asked the United Nations to despatch an expert on polders. The United\r\n\r\nNations was good enough to get us one, but unfortunately the man fell  sick\r\n\r\nand  he  could  not pass the medical test. So I am afraid that  is  another\r\n\r\ntrough  in  the Kallang Land Reclamation project. However, I do  not  think\r\n\r\nthere  is such urgency in getting going with it, and I hope that in  future\r\n\r\nyears our luck will be better with this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M.

Will this Trade\r\n\r\nUnion House be used by trade unions under one leadership or under the\r\n\r\nleadership of the various trade unions existing in Singapore? I fear that\r\n\r\nall the community centres in Singapore are under the influence of the\r\n\r\nParty in power. If the Singapore Conference Hall is to be subjected in the\r\n\r\nsame way as the community centres have been subjected, then it will be\r\n\r\nbad. I know that $1,150,000 will be spent on the Trade Union House, with\r\n\r\nanother $3 million required for its completion. The important question is,\r\n\r\nwhether this House will engender a spirit that is pro-Communist, anti.\r\n\r\nCommunist, or Communist in nature because I know that there are two\r\n\r\nopposing factions who will fight each other to the end.

The purpose of building this House is to  assist  the\r\n\r\ntrade unions in Singapore to consolidate themselves into a strong unit  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  employers. Of course, facilities will be provided to  help  the\r\n\r\nworkers  of  Singapore  to  protect their  interests.  There  will  be  no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination between workers of this or that union.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has asked whether pro-Communists will be\r\n\r\nallowed to use the Trade Union\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHouse.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Government policy on this is very  clear,\r\n\r\nand  there is no doubt that no facilities in the State will be  provided\r\n\r\nfor use by any force for a pro-Communist or a Communist cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I also have an amendment* on the same Head which amounts to the same thing.

When the Government mooted the project of a Trade\r\n\r\nUnion  House, it decided to place one of its houses in Queen  Street  at\r\n\r\nthe disposal of the T.U.C. In fact it was occupied by the T.U.C. and  it\r\n\r\nbecame known as a sort of Trade Union House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on every occasion when the subject of a Trade Union House was\r\n\r\nbrought up, I objected to it on the ground that the P.A.P. was trying to\r\n\r\noffer a sop to the workers of Singapore. The workers of Singapore do not\r\n\r\nrequire  such a sop. Events have proved that so long as the workers  are\r\n\r\nnot  with  the  Government,  they can be  branded  as  Communists,  pro-Communists, Communist sympathisers, etc. If it is the intention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to help the workers to own a house, then the proper thing  is\r\n\r\nfor  it  to  lease a piece of land at a very nominal rent to  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  so that they can build a house of their own and not be  indebted\r\n\r\nto  the P.A.P. for a house which they themselves can afford to build.  A\r\n\r\ndollar  from each worker in Singapore will bring in enough money to  put\r\n\r\nup  a  Trade Union House of their own. But land is difficult to  get  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and if the Government is really keen on wanting to  help  the\r\n\r\nworkers, then it should lease a piece of land to them at a nominal rent.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us see what kind of a Trade Union House it is going to be. It is\r\n\r\nnot a Trade Union House. It is a Conference Hall. This building is going to\r\n\r\nbe  3,  4  or 5 storeys, and I think one storey will be given to the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  organisation  to be used as an office. It will  not  be  correct  to\r\n\r\ndescribe that building as a Trade Union House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary in his reply just now said that it was the\r\n\r\nintention of the Government to help the trade unionists so that they  could\r\n\r\nconsolidate themselves and get unified. But how can they get unified if the\r\n\r\nlaw  providing for their unification has not been assented to? How can they\r\n\r\nbe unified if the Government encourages their particular group of unions to\r\n\r\ngo  out  fighting against other groups of trade unions? In fact,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\ncause  of  the  present industrial unrest can be laid at the  door  of  the\r\n\r\npolitical struggle that is being waged in the trade union field. There  are\r\n\r\nunions  under  the  control of the P.A.P. trying to  prove  that  they  are\r\n\r\nbetter,  and  there are unions belonging to another group trying  to  prove\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  better too. Therefore, we have all this industrial  unrest\r\n\r\nthat  is  going  on.  If  the Government means to  unify  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement,  then it should reintroduce the law to see that the trade  unions\r\n\r\nare  unified, otherwise they cannot be unified as there is no law providing\r\n\r\nfor their unification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Trade Union House will be used more as a Conference\r\n\r\nHall.  In  the  light of the constitutional advance, foreign relations  and\r\n\r\nexternal  affairs  will  be  in the hands of the  Central  Government.  The\r\n\r\nCentral  Government  already had a Conference Hall  known  as  Tunku  Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman  Hall.  How  are  we  going  to arrange  international  meetings  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  when  we  are going to lose our identity? At the  present  time,\r\n\r\nSingapore  still  has  some  identity in the international  field,  because\r\n\r\nalthough  its foreign relations are in the hands of the British, its  trade\r\n\r\nand  cultural relations are in the hands of the Singapore Government. There\r\n\r\nfore,  United Nations missions and delegations of a commerical  or  trading\r\n\r\ncharacter can hold their conferences\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhere and Singapore can be a member. But once we are in closer relationship\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation  in  1963,  we will  have  lost  our  identity.  All\r\n\r\nrepresentations  will have to be made through the Central  Government.  So\r\n\r\nwhy should we go to the extent of spending $4 million or $5 million to put\r\n\r\nup a building that may not be used for the purposes it is intended for? It\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  done,  because  Singapore would  then  have  no  standing\r\n\r\nwhatsoever in the international field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I am more concerned about is this claim of the P.A.P. that this\r\n\r\nis  one  of  its pledges which it is going to fulfil. There  are  so  many\r\n\r\npledges  of  the P.A.P. that are never fulfilled and it does not  want  to\r\n\r\ntalk  about them. Why does the Government say that it is going  to  fulfil\r\n\r\nthis pledge? Is it just because it wants to get the workers on its side by\r\n\r\ngiving  them a little bit of sugar? The workers of Singapore are no longer\r\n\r\nthat  foolish. At one time, they could have been foolish, when the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwith its wonderful propaganda could proclaim militantly in the trade union\r\n\r\nfield  that it was the champion of the workers. In fact, the champions  of\r\n\r\nthe civil service were the ones to effect the pay cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I object to the Trade Union House on principle. If the Government is\r\n\r\nvery  sincere, it should lease to the workers a piece of land at a nominal\r\n\r\nfee  and let them build their own trade union house. If in this particular\r\n\r\nbuilding you are going to have international conferences, the use of  that\r\n\r\nfloor  may  be  restricted. Suppose the unions go on strike - a  Government-controlled union may go on strike because we have read in the papers  that\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister for Culture  has  said  that\r\n\r\nGovernment has said that Government staff may go on strike: you  may  even\r\n\r\nhave  a P.A.P. union saying that it is going on strike - then the particular\r\n\r\nfloor  allotted  for the use of the T.U.C. will be full of activities  and\r\n\r\nif,  at  the  same time, there is to be an international conference,  then\r\n\r\nthere will be a mix up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, if you are going to give one floor to the T.U.C. in a building\r\n\r\nwhich  is under Government control, I do not know what kind of gadgets  may\r\n\r\nbe  put  in  by  the Government in order to find out what the  workers  are\r\n\r\ndoing. Surely that is not the intention of the Government. But it can  lead\r\n\r\nto  suspicion, and the suspicion is justifiable in the light  of  what  has\r\n\r\nbeen happening in the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel it is not the serious\r\n\r\nintention  of  the Government to build this Singapore Conference  Hall-cum-Trade  Union  House.  I  think  it has been put  here  in  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates - the figure $4 million appears there - purely for the purposes of\r\n\r\nmaking  political  propaganda.  Sir, as  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  has\r\n\r\npointed out, the building of a Trade Union House was an election pledge  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  I believe they said then that they wanted to put  up  a  Trade\r\n\r\nUnion  House  at  a  cost  of $2 million. Then about  one  year  after  the\r\n\r\nelections,  sometime last year, I think the former Minister for Labour  and\r\n\r\nLaw  told  us  that  the Minister for Finance said he  could  not  give  $2\r\n\r\nmillion. So it had to be somewhere around $1 million. And, the next thing I\r\n\r\nsee, Sir, is $4,150,000. The Parliamentary Secretary says it is going to be\r\n\r\na  Conference  Hall-cum-Trade Union House. I do  not  know  what  Singapore\r\n\r\nConference  Hall  the  Government has in mind. I  do  not  think  they  are\r\n\r\nseriously suggesting that if the International Animal Lovers' League  wants\r\n\r\nto  hold  a conference, they want the hall in the Trade Union House  to  be\r\n\r\nused. Anyway, I do not know for what particular\r\n\r\npurpose  this  Conference Hall is supposed to be used.  May  I  venture  to\r\n\r\nsuggest, Sir, that the main purpose of putting this vote in is to  build  a\r\n\r\nTrade  Union House? I am not like the Member for Cairnhill, Sir. I  do  not\r\n\r\nlook upon this Trade Union House as a bribe to the workers. I associated my\r\n\r\nself with the election pledge that the Government made, and I think I can\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsafely  say  that the majority of the workers and the unions  do  not  mind\r\n\r\ngetting  a big Trade Union House - ten storeys, air-conditioned perhaps  from\r\n\r\nthe  ground floor to the roof top, comfortable chairs, and so on. They will\r\n\r\nbe happy to accept such a house from the Government, so long as -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Sir, it is like\r\n\r\naccepting  a  gift - financial aid from the Soviet Union or from  the  United\r\n\r\nStates  of America. There is nothing wrong in the gift itself. It  is  the\r\n\r\nmotive  behind the person who makes that gift. One can accept the gift  and\r\n\r\nstill  make  certain that the one who gives it does not get away  with  his\r\n\r\nmotive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Ask the Soviet Union to give you a Trade Union House!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I want to suggest here that -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It seems to\r\n\r\nme that the Leader of the House is not setting a very good example. Mr\r\n\r\nBani.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I can quite well understand why the Leader of the House is\r\n\r\nthrilled  at  the  idea  of receiving American aid.  Perhaps  he  has  been\r\n\r\ndreaming  of  American  aid  for the last few days.  Anyway,  that  is  his\r\n\r\nbusiness.  But  quite seriously, I think the important  thing  we  have  to\r\n\r\nrealise is this - what the labour movement in Singapore needs is not  a  huge\r\n\r\nstructure like the Cathay Building or the Asia Insurance Building. That  is\r\n\r\nunimportant.  It  is  only  secondary. I do not  say  the  workers  or  the\r\n\r\nunionists  would  not like to sit in an air-conditioned office  with  press\r\n\r\nbuttons,  and  all  you  have to do is to press a button  and  secretaries,\r\n\r\ntypists  and  stenographers come running round. No trade unionist  dislikes\r\n\r\nthis,  and  I  am  sure no worker dislikes having a really comfortable  and\r\n\r\nconvenient  Trade Union House. But this is not the motive for it.  You  can\r\n\r\nput  up a Trade Union House without there being a trade union movement, but\r\n\r\nit becomes a waste of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npublic  money.  I  was  really disturbed to listen  to  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  suggesting that this Trade Union House is going to be  used  by\r\n\r\nwhat  he  said  only those unions that are within the camp of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ngroup of unions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to make this point quite clear here. S.A.T.U. has been mention\r\n\r\ned  so  many times. In the first place, S.A.T.U. is not registered and  we\r\n\r\nhave  stated quite clearly that so long as it is not registered, it  shall\r\n\r\nrefrain  from  participation  in  any trade  dispute.  But,  nevertheless,\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. has been smeared and I am not going to defend it or say anything\r\n\r\nin favour of it or against the N.T.U.C. That is not my purpose now. But  I\r\n\r\nwant to make this quite clear - that when the previous T.U.C. was dissolved,\r\n\r\n82 trade unions representing -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I think I must rule very strictly on this. Time is\r\n\r\npassing.  Let  us  deal with the Trade Union House.  The  Member  is  quite\r\n\r\ncorrect, in passing, in defending S.A.T.U., but if he goes into details, he\r\n\r\nis going very far away from the\r\n\r\nitem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is not my intention now to defend S.A.T.U. But the point\r\n\r\nthat  I  want to make is: if you build a Trade Union House with $4 million,\r\n\r\nand if that is to be used by some cronies who lead the National Trade Union\r\n\r\nCentre,  which is a 14-man body, it is no use wasting $4 million of  public\r\n\r\nmoney  to build a Trade Union House for the exclusive use of a small  group\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunions.  In  that  context, I say that if you seek to, exclude  the  large\r\n\r\ngroup of unions that are outside the control of the P.A.P., then you might\r\n\r\nas  well  not build the Trade Union House. As I have said, what the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement today needs is not a building structure but assistance  in\r\n\r\nany  form  to strengthen its collective bargaining position. All that  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary said was just that the building was  going  to  be\r\n\r\nput  up for the purposes of strengthening the trade union movement so that\r\n\r\nthey  can  fight  the employers harder. I do not see  how  it  can  happen\r\n\r\nespecially  if the structure is merely going to accommodate a  handful  of\r\n\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I say this: that a Trade Union House, without a plan\r\n\r\nto  unify  the  trade union movement, consolidate and  strengthen  it,  is\r\n\r\nuseless. As the Member for Cairnhill has pointed out, the Bill to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  a  unified  trade  union movement is still in cold  storage.  And  it\r\n\r\nappears  it  is  not the intention of the Government to  provide  for  the\r\n\r\nunification of the trade union movement. If that is the case, then  I  say\r\n\r\nthere is no point in having your $4 million Conference Hall for the Animal\r\n\r\nLovers' League.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is there a ministerial reply?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson is never more\r\n\r\nentertaining and less persuasive than when he speaks with his tongue in his\r\n\r\ncheek.

We  selected  the site of the old St. Andrew's  School  in  Armenian\r\n\r\nStreet.  But the grounds were not sufficient. For that reason, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  had to consider moving this project to Shenton Way, opposite  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, a lot of planning  for  this  project  was\r\n\r\nrequired.  The members of the Planning Committee consisted of  myself,  Mr\r\n\r\nWoodhull, Mr Jamit Singh, who was always absent, and Mr Kandasamy.  After\r\n\r\nconsiderable  thought had been given to this project and  to  the  detailed\r\n\r\nplanning, Mr Speaker, Sir, we associated the Board of Architects  in  this\r\n\r\nproject,  and  we put out a design competition. The design competition  was\r\n\r\nannounced and the closing date is\r\n\r\nthe 31st January, 1962.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is intended to be an expensive building, and the\r\n\r\ncost  of  maintenance is going to be considerable. We  do  not  expect  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. to be able to afford maintaining a building of this size on its own.\r\n\r\nFor  that  reason  we  incorporated in this Trade  Union  House  project  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  Conference  Hall  as well. It will  be  possible  then  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to maintain this building and to lease floors to the T.U.C.  The\r\n\r\ncontrol will still be in the hands of the Government and the T.U.C. will be\r\n\r\nleased floors for offices. It is unfortunate, Mr Speaker, Sir, that whilst\r\n\r\nthe  planning  was  in progress, there was this rift  in  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement.  But  it does not follow, that just because there has  been  this\r\n\r\nrift, we should abandon this scheme. It is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworthwhile scheme and we should continue with it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point made by the Member for Cairnhill, Mr Speaker, Sir, he\r\n\r\nsays  that  we  will lose our identity when we are merged  into  a  greater\r\n\r\nFederation.  But Singapore will still be a great emporium, and  it  is  the\r\n\r\nbiggest  emporium in South-East Asia. There is no reason why we should  not\r\n\r\nhave a proper Conference Hall here in Singapore. We have no place which can\r\n\r\nserve  as a conference hall.

We have tried  to  develop\r\n\r\nevery  available piece of open land that we could find in the city  into  a\r\n\r\nsuitable  playground for children.

There has been no improvement and\r\n\r\nno  new construction. It was intended originally that the National Theatre\r\n\r\nshould be constructed on that site. But that scheme was later changed  and\r\n\r\nthe  new  site selected is on King George V Park. I do not understand  the\r\n\r\nreason for this change.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to some of the money\r\n\r\nwhich  has  not been spent in the 1961 Budget, firstly, it is  because  the\r\n\r\nParks  Department was under the City Council and it took some time for  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  to be integrated into the various Government departments.  I\r\n\r\nthink this department was quite lately integrated into the Labour Ministry.\r\n\r\nThat  partly, is the cause of the delay in implementing the 1961 programme.\r\n\r\nHowever,  as far as 1961 is concerned, the Ministry has submitted  all  its\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes to the Development Planning Committee in conjunction\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government's Four-Year Development Plan. I  understand  from  my\r\n\r\nofficer  that  the  Development Planning Committee  has  approved  all  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes submitted by the Ministry.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full programme for development is contained in the Four-Year Develop\r\n\r\nment  Plan. As far as 1961 and 1962 are concerned, the programmes proposed\r\n\r\nare   for  large  parks  in  the  Queenstown  neighbourhood,  Beach   Road\r\n\r\nReclamation. Farrer Park, that is, for resurfacing and parking bay, Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  Athletic  Centre and Jalan Besar Stadium, repairing the  spectators'\r\n\r\nstand.  Also  out  of  this total sum $100,000 is for the  development  of\r\n\r\nKallang Park and $20,000 for the extension of King George V Park.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the comments made by the Member for Aljunied, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, it is the usual habit of Members from the U.P.P. to remind the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore what wonderful things the ex-Mayor of the City of  Singapore\r\n\r\ndid  when  he was the Mayor. On Kallang Park, Mr Speaker, Sir, the  other\r\n\r\nday the Prime Minister pointed out that, from statistics, the Park has not\r\n\r\nbeen put to full use. So the Park officer has proposed a scheme to develop\r\n\r\nit.  More  facilities will be provided and the Park will be put to  proper\r\n\r\nuse, such as providing for a football pitch, a tennis court and so forth.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I must clarify what the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour has said just now.  When\r\n\r\nKallang  Park was built, there was no intention to show posterity that  the\r\n\r\nPark  was built by Ong Eng Guan. There was no bronze plate put up  to  show\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  opened on such and such a day by the Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan, as we  see  in  the  community  centres.\r\n\r\nrecreation  centres, the National Theatre, and I am sure, the  Trade  Union\r\n\r\nHouse and Conference Hall. The main purpose of most of these projects is to\r\n\r\nleave  something  to posterity to show that \"my great grandfather  built  a\r\n\r\nTrade Union House and Conference Hall\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened in Kallang Park was this. When the Prime Minister took over\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council, he stopped all work, all extensions,  all  improvements\r\n\r\nand other phases to complete Kallang Park.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThat  is why some people are still inquiring why Kallang Park is half done,\r\n\r\njust  as  Changi  Beach  was half done.

They did not want to complete the whole project\r\n\r\nbecause  the  theory was, \"If the Member for Hong Lim started it,  we  must\r\n\r\nstop it.\" But, Sir, rest assured that in all the construction I did in  the\r\n\r\nCity Council and during the time I was a Minister, I never left my name  to\r\n\r\nposterity.  It  was meant for the benefit of the people,  not  for  myself.\r\n\r\nYesterday  I  heard from the Prime Minister that he is now going  to  build\r\n\r\nhouses  at  Kallang Park. We have investigated the possibilities before  we\r\n\r\nbuilt  Kallang  Park. We found that it was a swamp before and  that  if  we\r\n\r\nbuilt  houses in that particular site, the rent would be so expensive  that\r\n\r\nnobody would be able to afford it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

But if we look at  the  Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan  on page 126, the question of Parks and  Open  Spaces  is\r\n\r\nclearly  mentioned here. In 1961, the sum estimated was $175,000;  in  1962\r\n\r\nit  is  $340,000. According to the Development Plan, we must put  in  this\r\n\r\namount of money in the first year, but whether we can carry out the project\r\n\r\nis  another  question. In the second year, 1962, we put in that  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney,  but  whether we can carry out the projects or not does not  matter.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I say that all these plans are only paper plans to mislead  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  give  them  the impression that the  Government  wants  to  do\r\n\r\nsomething  about all this. If we look clearly at these items  we  will  see\r\n\r\nthat  there  was  $175,000  in 1961 for the Government  to  carry  out  its\r\n\r\nproject. But in the 1961 Budget, only one-third of the whole vote will have\r\n\r\nbeen spent.

Member:</b> Farrer Park?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Farrer Park. A good place, Farrer Park. A very sensible ward!\r\n\r\nSir, the position prewar was that the football pitches at Farrer Park were\r\n\r\nvery good. During the war, what happened was that the Japanese confiscated\r\n\r\nall sorts of vehicles and used Farrer Park as a dumping ground for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthese  vehicles, with the result that the drainage of Farrer Park  suffered\r\n\r\nthereby. This drainage has not been restored to its fullest capacity  since\r\n\r\nthe  war. As a result, flooding takes place on the pitches. If there  is  a\r\n\r\nheavy  downpour of rain, it is not possible to play off these  games.  From\r\n\r\nthat  point of view, Jalan Besar Stadium is well looked after, because even\r\n\r\nafter the heaviest downpour, it is possible to play a football match there.\r\n\r\nBut  in  Farrer  Park, which is used by Second Division and Third  Division\r\n\r\nteams, if a heavy downpour takes place, say, within half an hour of a  game\r\n\r\nstarting, it becomes almost impossible to play the matches there. So I  ask\r\n\r\nthe Government to look into that matter and see what they can do to put the\r\n\r\nmatter right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must apologise. Just now I was\r\n\r\ndiscussing a matter with the Member for Tanglin. That was why I  was  taken\r\n\r\nby surprise. I did originally intend to point out to you that the two items - children's  playgrounds and parks - could not be separated because  in  every\r\n\r\npark   .there  are  children's  playgrounds.  Both  parks  and   children's\r\n\r\nplaygrounds,  whether with or without a park, serve the same  purpose,  for\r\n\r\nchildren to play in and for them to have a breath of fresh air. What I  was\r\n\r\ntrying  to point out just now is that with all these open spaces,  be  they\r\n\r\nparks  or  playing  grounds,  there is a congestion  of  parks  and  not  a\r\n\r\ncongestion of people in a small area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister for Health and Law pointed out, they are meant to join\r\n\r\nup with Elizabeth Park on the seaside. Sir, .that is the place which needs\r\n\r\nthe least numbers of parks because of the sea air and the open space. This\r\n\r\nis in my area, and I am glad the Government is making the Mountbatten Ward\r\n\r\nas  healthy  as possible, with as much fresh air as possible. But  what  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to point out is that while these parks exist for the  people\r\n\r\ngoing  there  to  have fresh air, the air is polluted by the  ikan  belis\r\n\r\nspread out all over the place - in, outside and around the parks. In fact,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  empty spaces meant for the people going there to have fresh  air  are\r\n\r\ngiving out foul air.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is in the daytime that some ikan belis is\r\n\r\ndried  on  the promenade and not in the parks.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the Member for Hong Lim tidied up the piece of land fronting  the\r\n\r\nsea  all  along  Nicoll  Highway. He had  it  paved  and  developed  as  a\r\n\r\npromenade.

If the Government could build more creches, then it  would\r\n\r\nbe  very helpful to women. Women then could ,go out to work and leave their\r\n\r\nchildren in the care of those in charge of the creches, so that they  could\r\n\r\nwork  without any worry. The three creches are to be built at Tanah Street,\r\n\r\nBukit Ho Swee and Geylang Serai.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to answer a question raised by the Member for Delta.\r\n\r\nThere  are no creches there. There is also no creche in the Stamford  area.\r\n\r\nThe  Government are going to improve themselves. I am not going to say  any\r\n\r\nthing about the good relationship with U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There seems to be a very interesting conversation\r\n\r\ngoing  on between the Member for Stamford, the Member for Delta, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bras  Basah  and the Minister for Finance! I would  suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Stamford address her remarks to me and ignore what is  said  on\r\n\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am talking to you but\r\n\r\nsince they asked, I have to answer. If they had not asked, I would not have\r\n\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the other items, I think that if the Government is not sincere\r\n\r\nabout  them then I propose that the money should be used to build more  and\r\n\r\nmore  creches  and not community centres in order to allow women  to  leave\r\n\r\ntheir children in the creches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to raise is this. If the Government does not build\r\n\r\nmore  creches,  then I hope it will build more homes to  provide  amenities\r\n\r\nfor the old people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I am not speaking.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Stamford rather grudges the small\r\n\r\ncreche  in  Kreta Ayer, Sir.

The simple reason is this, Mr Speaker, Sir.  The  major\r\n\r\nitems in the Budget, you will see, are the Junior Approved School and  the\r\n\r\nRural  Settlement.  The  difficulty is  to  locate  sites  for  these  two\r\n\r\nprojects.

When the  National  Art\r\n\r\nGallery  gets  going,  it is proposed eventually to develop  in  the  same\r\n\r\nbuilding  an  Academy  of  Arts  where, in  addition  to  just  exhibiting\r\n\r\npaintings  and so on, there will be courses teaching painting,  music  and\r\n\r\ndancing.  At  the  moment, this is no more than  a  conception.  For  that\r\n\r\nreason,  we are just putting in a token vote of $10.

If\r\n\r\nanybody  has  gone to one of the studios of Radio Singapore, he  will  find\r\n\r\nthat  these  doors  are not the kind that they can  enter,  for  they  are\r\n\r\nspecially constructed. They are \"accoustic\" doors, one side of which faces\r\n\r\nan  air-conditioned  room and the other side faces  outside,  which  is  of\r\n\r\nordinary room temperature. I understand from the engineers that under  such\r\n\r\nconditions a door of this kind will be subjected to considerable stress and\r\n\r\n.strain on account of the differences in temperature, and will have  to  be\r\n\r\nspecially  constructed  to  be  able  to  stand  both  the  differences  of\r\n\r\ntemperature inside of the door as well as to be accoustically sound.  These\r\n\r\ncosts  have  been worked out by the engineers.

In fact,  the  work\r\n\r\nwill  be  shared out between these two firms.

The moment the land  has  been  acquired,  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed  to  start building the studio itself. But I am  told  the  studio\r\n\r\nwould take about two years to complete, because it is a specialised type of\r\n\r\nbuilding. But during this period it is possible to have a sort of temporary\r\n\r\ntelevision service from a semi-permanent building or a reconditioned  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  studio  building.

I hope the Minister will not  just  transplant\r\n\r\neverything  that  goes on in other temperate regions to Singapore,  because\r\n\r\nsome  of  our surroundings are different. In a temperate country one  could\r\n\r\neasily pack a dozen or 20 or 50 people in a small room. But here, we do not\r\n\r\nwant to encourage such a large group to view one television set.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this, Sir. There is always a fear on the Opposition\r\n\r\nside - especially the Barisan Sosialis, but sometimes we also share with them\r\n\r\ntheir  fears - that when the Government organises something, it  is  thinking\r\n\r\nnot  of  the  educational  or cultural value  of  the  new  thing  but  its\r\n\r\npropaganda and political value.

He refers it to a so-called body of experts.  If  there\r\n\r\ncould  be appointed an advisory committee on television, that would help  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal.  Parents  may want to know what sort  of  programmes  will  be\r\n\r\nprovided,  because  I see here a statement that there  will  be  commercial\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  and  that it is, hoped the fees will meet all  running  costs.\r\n\r\nSir, we know that television is going to be very expensive but if, for  the\r\n\r\nsake  of  meeting  all the running costs, we, sacrifice ,  the  educational\r\n\r\nvalue of television and instead suffer, something that is injurious to  the\r\n\r\nprogress of our younger generation, then it will not be\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngood  to  introduce television.

I  do not pretend  to  know  anything  of  the\r\n\r\ntechnical  side  of television. But there is, I would suggest,  the  other\r\n\r\nside  of  any project, and that is the effect of television on the people,\r\n\r\nespecially the youth, and how it is going to be accepted by the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, I have no technical knowledge but I was fortunate enough,\r\n\r\nwhen  going  through different countries, to be able to put  up  in  homes\r\n\r\nwhere there were television sets. My special interest being in the welfare\r\n\r\nof  women  and  youth, I have had discussions with those people  who  used\r\n\r\ntelevision  sets  and with mothers about the effect of television  on  the\r\n\r\nchildren. We have also had round-table discussions whenever subjects  such\r\n\r\nas  vice  and television and their effect on children come up. Apart  from\r\n\r\nthat,  Sir, my interest in this subject has taken me through Melbourne.  I\r\n\r\nsaw  the  Director  of the Audio Visual Department of  the  University  of\r\n\r\nMelbourne. Apart from discussions with him when going round his University\r\n\r\nand  seeing the things connected with audio vision we discussed  it  again\r\n\r\nrecently  when  he  visited Singapore on his way back from  America  after\r\n\r\nhaving studied the educational use of television. After he left Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe  still  correspond, and I have very valuable suggestions made  by  this\r\n\r\nexpert,  who  has made it a special study when going round  the  different\r\n\r\nparts of the world to see how television can be used for education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all these discussions and experiences of mine, there is, one\r\n\r\nprominent  feature on which everybody seems to agree - that  television,  if\r\n\r\nhandled  the  wrong  way,  can be a curse to the nation;  but  if  handled\r\n\r\nproperly\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nright from the beginning, can be a very very important arm of the education\r\n\r\nsystem.  I  would  like  to quote just a few lines  of  the  correspondence\r\n\r\nbetween this Melbourne University expert and myself on this. He says:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Television could either help solve the problem of teacher shortage,\r\n\r\nswollen classrooms.\r\n\r\nmore knowledge in less time; or it can be a serious competitor with all\r\n\r\nexisting educational and communal welfare efforts.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In undeveloped countries [meaning the developing countries, I suppose]\r\n\r\nwhere the governments are using every possible means\r\n\r\nto focus education on national construction for the national future, urging\r\n\r\nits citizens to help even to the point of self-sacrifice, it\r\n\r\nseems incongruous to me to waste funds and efforts in establishing an\r\n\r\ninstrument which\r\n\r\nwill have the very opposite effect.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also learnt that once television has been accepted as mere\r\n\r\nentertainment (the countries that have made that mistake are regretting  it\r\n\r\nnow  and  they  feel  that  any  country that is  beginning,  to  introduce\r\n\r\ntelevision  should be very careful), it is very difficult indeed  to  bring\r\n\r\neducation into it. That is the opinion of most experts, mothers and  others\r\n\r\nthat I have met.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It says here:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Entertainment television as opposed to instructional television is\r\n\r\nacknowledged  everywhere  as, at best, one of  the  most  successful  time\r\n\r\nconsumers ever invented.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Undeveloped countries can use the new television medium ...'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is the most important part -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Television has been known to have the quality of holding  people  to\r\n\r\nthe  set. As I have said, that can be a curse or an advantage. Now,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  private document, but if the Minister would like  documents,\r\n\r\nwhich  are  not  private,  on articles such as  \"Automation  coming  into\r\n\r\nSchool\"  and telling how television has been very successful  in  certain\r\n\r\nschools in America and has been a failure in others, and \"T.V. finds  its\r\n\r\nplace  in  U.S. schools\", I can assure him that they are very useful  and\r\n\r\nare  the  results of study made 'by an expert on the matter. I  do  hope,\r\n\r\nSir,  that the Minister for Culture will give this very serious  thought,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  have,  as  I  have said, come across people  who  think  that\r\n\r\ntelevision is a curse to their nation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> With regard to what the Member for Mountbatten has said,\r\n\r\nI  could  not  agree  more.  Definitely, any instrument,  whether  it  is\r\n\r\ntelevision,  radio or cinema, if badly used, becomes a curse.  If  it  is\r\n\r\nwell used, it becomes valuable. In designing programmes for television we\r\n\r\nhave  borne in mind both its entertainment and instructional value, i.e.,\r\n\r\nwe want to make a success of television, so as to entertain as well as to\r\n\r\ninstruct.  We  have  an expert from Australia who is helping  us  in  our\r\n\r\nprogramming, and we also had valuable suggestions from the N.H.K., Japan,\r\n\r\nas  regards programming and the extent to which television could be  used\r\n\r\nfor  school broadcasts. In the formulation of school programmes, we  will\r\n\r\nnaturally  consult and get the advice of teachers on how best  television\r\n\r\ncould be used to assist\r\n\r\nteachers in their work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when I was in Japan last year, I went to see some of the school\r\n\r\nprogrammes. They told me that, as a result of introducing television, the\r\n\r\npowers  of  comprehension of a child have increased by  about  100  per\r\n\r\ncent, when a child begins to understand what\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthings are which he only reads in books. So I certainly agree with what has\r\n\r\nbeen said by the Member for Mountbatten.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with what the Member for Tanglin has to say. We must use\r\n\r\ntelevision to good effect, and to beware of its social effects. As  regards\r\n\r\nthe role the Opposition can play in making television a success, if anybody\r\n\r\nis  interested and can play musical instruments, dance and sing, I shall be\r\n\r\nglad to consider any suggestions they have to offer in that respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister mentions experts. Can\r\n\r\nI  ask  him  whether they are all technical experts, or  are  any  of  them\r\n\r\neducationists?  He  did  mention getting teachers.  Could  I  suggest  that\r\n\r\nteachers  who know nothing about television and teachers who have not  even\r\n\r\nseen  television  are not likely to be very helpful in the subject,  unless\r\n\r\nthey  have made a study of how television can help the children.  When  the\r\n\r\nMinister  mentions the Opposition doing some dances and music, he may  have\r\n\r\nmeant it as a joke. But that is exactly what we are warning him against - the\r\n\r\nwrong type of culture, which is thought to be culture when it is not really\r\n\r\nculture.  When you talk about it, it is not so bad, but when  you  actually\r\n\r\nsee it, Sir, it becomes worse than yellow culture. I do not know what\r\n\r\ncolour to call it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> At least for the next five years, our television will be\r\n\r\nin black and white. So there will be no particular colour attached to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the role teachers play, it is not so much on the technical\r\n\r\nside. As we are going to have school programmes, the teachers should let us\r\n\r\nknow  what exactly they want. It is no use, say, in a particular year, they\r\n\r\nhave, as part of the literature textbooks, some famous novel and if we have\r\n\r\nfilms  depicting scenes from some other world, it may not be valuable.  For\r\n\r\nexample, this year, we are playing King Henry V.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThat  is a textbook. So we make it into a film where scenes from the  play\r\n\r\nare enacted. So the teachers' role is not to help actually in devising the\r\n\r\nprogramme  but  to give their suggestions and to say what value  such  and\r\n\r\nsuch  a  programme has, and how they think it could be  put  over  to  the\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the general content of what is good culture and what is bad\r\n\r\nculture,  I  am  quite  contented that so far the  radio  programmes  have\r\n\r\nManaged to avoid rather deplorable examples of yellow culture. The nearest\r\n\r\nwe  got  to, I think, was when the Member for Hong Lim said we had a  song\r\n\r\nabout  \"I  am  my own Grandpa\", and I am told since then,  we  have  never\r\n\r\nexceeded the bounds of decency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, from the Minister's answer, I realise he still\r\n\r\ndoes  not  quite catch what I mean by the potentialities of television  in\r\n\r\neducation.  Probably not being an educationalist and  not  having  studied\r\n\r\ntelevision  enough,  he does not understand. But  can  I  suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that he get an expert on the subject? Evidently it is  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  me to explain to him here. I would try in the C.P.A. Room if he would\r\n\r\nlike to talk to me. I am not such an expert in the technical part, but  in\r\n\r\nthe social part of it, I can tell him quite a lot of things. But would he,\r\n\r\nbefore  he really launches on the subject, make up his mind that an expert\r\n\r\non the educational side of television be consulted?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Minister like to talk to the hon.

In the whole estimates we can see  clearly\r\n\r\nhere  that the Government is very interested in and concerned with Malayan\r\n\r\nculture  and its early conception. Therefore, this House also  feels  that\r\n\r\nthe  development  of  a  Malayan culture is very important  to  the  whole\r\n\r\nnation,  and  that it is necessary that we must have Malayan  culture  as\r\n\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, last year, when a meeting took place in this House, we approved\r\n\r\na sum of $4 million for the development of the Ministry of Culture. But the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture has spent only about $1 million this year. That  means\r\n\r\nonly  one-quarter  of  the estimated expenditure.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture, since its inception, has carried out a great  deal  of\r\n\r\ncultural  activities.  It has disseminated its efforts  and  has  tried  to\r\n\r\nencourage cultural organisations in their activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there is no central organisation in the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nto  co-ordinate  all  the cultural activities in Singapore.  Therefore,  at\r\n\r\npresent,  all  the  cultural activities in Singapore  are  carried  out  by\r\n\r\namateur organisations such as the Old Boys' Associations, the trade  unions\r\n\r\nand  the rural organisations. If these organisations do not make an  effort\r\n\r\nto  carry out cultural activities, then the so-called Malayan culture  will\r\n\r\nnot  take  shape, because the Ministry of Culture itself does not encourage\r\n\r\ncultural activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember that almost every cultural body in\r\n\r\nSingapore was invited to take part in the National Day celebrations and  in\r\n\r\nthe Cultural Festival. Unless these cultural organisations are prepared  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  items  and talent, then the results of these celebrations  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  so very good, and this is not conducive to an early conception  of\r\n\r\nMalayan culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture expresses doubts in respect of the items contri\r\n\r\nbuted  by the people's organisations. They are invited to contribute  items\r\n\r\nfor the celebrations, and when they apply\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor their performances to be approved, they are always turned down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture and his Parliamentary Secretary have publicly\r\n\r\nappealed  to  the people of Singapore to take part in cultural  activities\r\n\r\nand  to  contribute literary works, dances and music. But the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  takes a doubtful attitude and sometimes it even looks  down  upon\r\n\r\nthe  works  of local artistes. These people are therefore discouraged  and\r\n\r\nthey are unable to present their works to the people of Singapore. If this\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs is to continue, then I think the establishment  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture is nothing but a propaganda organisation  which  just\r\n\r\ndisseminates the policies of the Government, and the whole significance of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  Ministry  will then be lost. The main objective of  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nshould be the encouragement of local cultural activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last year, we heard the Yang di-Pertuan Negara saying\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government would establish a Cultural Brigade and the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture  also spoke on this subject. At that sitting of the  House  I\r\n\r\nasked  the  Minister  for  Culture when  the  Cultural  Brigade  would  be\r\n\r\nestablished  in  order  to put more life into the cultural  activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  am  asking  him again when the  Cultural  Brigade  will  be\r\n\r\nestablished.  Could  it  be  that  the  Cultural  Brigade  has  not   been\r\n\r\nestablished  up  to now because of political reasons? At  that  time,  the\r\n\r\nMinister said he had nothing to do with politics. Mr Speaker, Sir, we can\r\n\r\nsee no provision for the Cultural Brigade in the present Estimates. We can\r\n\r\nonly see provision for the establishment of the National Theatre. It is  a\r\n\r\ngood  thing  to have such a theatre. But if we do not have more programmes\r\n\r\nand  more  cultural  activities, what is the use of  having  the  National\r\n\r\nTheatre?  From the speeches of the Minister and of Government Members,  we\r\n\r\ncan see clearly that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture  is not sincere in establishing the Cultural Brigade. I  feel  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should establish the Cultural Brigade. It is a good idea and it\r\n\r\nwill put more life into the cultural activities in Singapore. The attitude\r\n\r\nof the Government\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntowards  cultural  activities is decided by its  political  views.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  many workers interested in cultural activities are not  allowed\r\n\r\nto  participate  in  the  Cultural Brigade because,  in  the  eyes  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, they are Communists or pro-Communists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a man interested in cultural matters must take an\r\n\r\nactive part in cultural activities, but in the view of the Government he is\r\n\r\na  doubtful  character  because he is taking a  very  active  part  in  the\r\n\r\npromotion of culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel the Ministry of Culture must re-consider its\r\n\r\nattitude towards the establishment of the Cultural Brigade and it must  not\r\n\r\ndoubt the character of the cultural workers. Those people who are active in\r\n\r\nthe  cultural field must be absorbed into the Ministry of Culture so  that\r\n\r\nculture may be actively promoted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past two years, the Ministry of Culture and the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have been talking about the people's attendance  at  the  Aneka\r\n\r\nRagam  and  so  on, but this year the attendance at these performances  has\r\n\r\ndropped.  The attitude of the Government towards cultural organisations  is\r\n\r\none of suspicion. The Government is rather superficial in its dealings with\r\n\r\nthe local cultural organisations. This goes to show that the Government  is\r\n\r\nnot sincere in the promotion of culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Minister for Culture will realise that, in\r\n\r\norder  to have more cultural activities and more enthusiastic work in  the\r\n\r\nfield  of  culture,  those who are now engaged in cultural  work  must  be\r\n\r\nencouraged  to  take a more important part and be given more opportunities\r\n\r\nto present their works and to express their artistic abilities. It is only\r\n\r\nin this way that we can build a true Malayan culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I know that next week the Minister for Culture may go\r\n\r\nto  Kuching. It is reported that he is going to lead a cultural mission to\r\n\r\nKuching.  I do not know whether he is going to treat the members  of  this\r\n\r\nmission as the future pillars of the Cultural Brigade.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I hope the Ministry of Culture will try its best to\r\n\r\nencourage  local artistes and it should not in \\any way try  to  interfere\r\n\r\nwith  their  work.  It  should not be suspicious of  the  works  of  local\r\n\r\nartistes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all that I can gather is this. The Mem\r\n\r\nber  for  Choa  Chu  Kang  feels that some local artistes  are  not  being\r\n\r\nencouraged as they should be, because when he talks of local artistes  and\r\n\r\nlocal  cultural organisations being let down, he is not referring  to  all\r\n\r\nlocal  artistes and local cultural organisations. There are certain  types\r\n\r\nof  organisations  which  have  tried to introduce  politics  into,  their\r\n\r\ncultural activities; they have tried to introduce programmes which do  not\r\n\r\nconform  with  our  intention  to build a  culture  which  is  Malayan  in\r\n\r\ncharacter  and in orientation. Of course, the Government has been  careful\r\n\r\nnot  to  allow  itself to be used by them. Although it has  been  repeated\r\n\r\nbefore that the Government itself cannot create Malayan culture, all  that\r\n\r\nit  can do is to encourage cultural activities and hope that, as a result,\r\n\r\nof doing so, something worthwhile can come out of it all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has said just now that we have prevented local artistes\r\n\r\nor  local cultural workers from expressing themselves. But he knows  that\r\n\r\nthe songs that have been banned and the dances that have not been allowed\r\n\r\nto  be  performed  are  Communist items and songs which  everybody  knows\r\n\r\nabout.  The tunes are there. They come at the last minute and give  us  a\r\n\r\nplay  which  they  all  know has been banned before,  because  it  is  of\r\n\r\nCommunist  origin - not necessarily because it is of  a  Communist  nature;\r\n\r\nthere are some good Communist plays which we allow people to perform. But\r\n\r\nwhere  you  find a certain Communist play, poem or music is  in  conflict\r\n\r\nwith  our  intention  to  create a Malayan  loyalty  and  a  Malayan  con\r\n\r\nsciousness, we have prevented it. In  each case where we prevent them  or\r\n\r\nsay, \"You cannot play this,\" they try to smuggle it in. They then go  and\r\n\r\nsee a few Assemblymen and say -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I have only a few minutes left.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is only one more minute.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> There are certain types of cultural organisations which\r\n\r\nhave  primarily political motives that are detrimental to the country,  and\r\n\r\nthey  will  certainly get no encouragement from this Government.

According to the Four-Year Development  Plan,  the\r\n\r\nDirector of Telecommunications had suggested an overall change of all  net\r\n\r\nworks  in  a three-year phased programme starting from 1960. The  networks\r\n\r\nthat were supposed to have been changed were 3 for the Combined Operations\r\n\r\nRoom  and 3 for the Divisions, and in toto about $600,000 was expected  to\r\n\r\nbe  spent  in  1961.

I\r\n\r\ndid say that the main difficulty about giving aid to schools was that such\r\n\r\naided schools normally did not have free unencumbered title to the land on\r\n\r\nwhich the school was built. Because of that, even though approval to  give\r\n\r\naid had been given to schools subject to their being able to produce title\r\n\r\nto  the land, they were unable to take on the grant which had already been\r\n\r\nallotted  for them. I have already stated that we are attempting to  relax\r\n\r\nrules for the granting of aid, but not without conditions as suggested  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Changi. I hope to be able to pass the amended rules  after\r\n\r\nwhich it will prove easier for such aid to be given. On the other hand, it\r\n\r\nwill  be  noted that if the Ministry had paid out only more than a quarter\r\n\r\nof  a  million  dollars for 1961, the balance of the year's allocation  is\r\n\r\nbeing  revoted  so  that  the sum involved will  still  be  available  for\r\n\r\ndistribution. That is why for subhead 1, we have a total of  $3.3  million\r\n\r\nfor 1962, which really consists of a $1 million vote for 1962 and a revote\r\n\r\namounting $2.3 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D57 be reduced by $10 in respect of\r\n\r\nsubhead 2.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see here, Sir, only an item - \"Contribution to the Development of\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya\".

I  have  noticed that on page 530 of the  1961  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates,  we approved $556,880 for equipment for technical  schools\r\n\r\nunder  five  items. But in the 1962 Development Estimates, Queenstown\r\n\r\nSecondary  School  is to spend $48,000, and Tanjong Katong  Secondary\r\n\r\nSchool  is  to spend $53,070. But the other schools do  not  spend  a\r\n\r\nsingle  cent. On the other hand, for Queenstown Secondary  School  we\r\n\r\nhave allocated $128,000, and for Tanjong Katong Secondary School, the\r\n\r\nsum allocated is $128,880. But the sum already spent is only $53,070.\r\n\r\nOn  Queenstown Secondary School, it has spent only $48,000.

He has asked why, after having been provided with  a  sum  of\r\n\r\n$128,000  for  two schools - Queenstown Secondary School and  Tanjong  Katong\r\n\r\nSecondary  School - we have managed to spend about $50,000,  and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  balance  of  $75,000-odd has not been spent.  I  thought  I  explained\r\n\r\nsometime  back  that Queenstown and Tanjong Katong Secondary  Schools  were\r\n\r\ncalled  technical  schools a few years ago when they  were  opened  by  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government. But they were no different from  any  other  ordinary\r\n\r\nacademic  secondary  school. So it was necessary for us  to  convert  these\r\n\r\nschools  into  really  technical schools by purchasing expensive  technical\r\n\r\nequipment,  which takes time even after the order has been placed.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nit  takes  six  to  eight months before the equipment can arrive.  That  is\r\n\r\npartly  the  explanation. It is true that although there is provision  this\r\n\r\nyear for the purchase of equipment amounting to $100,000 each for the three\r\n\r\ntechnical schools - at Serangoon\r\n\r\nGarden Estate, Dunearn Road and Ngee Ann Kongsi - these schools will probably\r\n\r\ntake  till  the end of 1962 before they will be established. So  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  it is wise to order equipment even before the schools are available.\r\n\r\nThat  is why we have to provide similar sums for 1962 so that by the  time\r\n\r\nthese  technical  schools are really in existence  the  equipment  will  be\r\n\r\navailable to go into the schools for 1963.\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the reply\r\n\r\ngiven  by the Minister, the three schools, namely, Serangoon Garden Estate\r\n\r\nSchool,  Tanjong Katong School and Ngee Ann Kongsi School,  will  only  be\r\n\r\ncompleted by the end of 1962. But the question is, if it is the case,  why\r\n\r\nthen  should we in the 1962 Development Estimates provide these provisions\r\n\r\nfor  these  three  schools, namely, the provision  of  $100,000  for  each\r\n\r\nschool, since no school is going to be completed within this year?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  the  debate  on the last item, you were kind enough to  assist  me  by\r\n\r\nreferring  the  Member for Havelock to another section of the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates. To answer the Member for Havelock, may I request him to be kind\r\n\r\nenough  to turn to page 43, at the bottom of the page, where he  will  see\r\n\r\nthat  work has been going on at the Secondary Technical Schools at Dunearn\r\n\r\nRoad,  Ngee  Ann  Kongsi and Serangoon Gardens. For  this  year,  $40,000,\r\n\r\n$40,000  and  $120,000  respectively have been  spent.  In  1962,  another\r\n\r\n$600,000  each will be spent. So that, as I have stated, we hope  to  have\r\n\r\nthese  schools  ready by the end of 1962. The $100,000-odd  for  equipment\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  be placed, so that by the time that equipment  arrives  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, it can go into the schools and be ready for 1963.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad the Minister has referred\r\n\r\nto  page  43.  If  we look at page 43, these three schools  will  not  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  in 1962, because the estimated expenditure in 1962 is  just  a\r\n\r\npart of the original plans for these three schools, and there are sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney required for a further year to complete these three schools.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It looks as if we will now be discussing not only the 1962 Estimates but also 1963. To really provide a secondary technical\r\n\r\nschool with full equipment, it will be necessary to have equipment  worth\r\n\r\n$150,000. But for the first stage, we think that $100,000 should suffice,\r\n\r\nbecause machines and fitting equipment would amount to $63,000, woodcraft\r\n\r\nequipment $20,000, metal craft $11,000, foundry equipment nearly  $7,000,\r\n\r\nand  building  equipment $3,000 - a total of $100,000. That  is  the  first\r\n\r\nstage. When the workshops have been equipped with this $100,000 worth  of\r\n\r\nequipment,  then perhaps we will have to make provision for an additional\r\n\r\n$50,000  per  school to make it a really first-class secondary  technical\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low, withdraw?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> indicated assent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D57 be reduced by $10 in respect of\r\n\r\nsubhead 5.*\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Lee Siew Choh.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the same question arises from this item. Last year's Budget\r\n\r\nproviding furniture and equipment for these three types of schools are: (1)\r\n\r\nPrimary  schools  $25,000, but $22,000 has been  spent;  (2)  Post  Primary\r\n\r\nSchools $243,000 voted for this year's expenditure, but not a cent has been\r\n\r\nspent;  and (3) Secondary Schools, $822,100 was provided, but only  $47,600\r\n\r\nhas  been  spent. Can the Minister kindly explain to us why all this  money\r\n\r\nhas not been spent?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, it will not be necessary\r\n\r\nreally to answer the first part of the question - Primary Schools' allocation\r\n\r\n$25,000  and  only $22,000 has been spent. As regards the item  of  $243,000\r\n\r\nmeant for furniture and equipment for post primary schools, may I say  that\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants to be careful with its expenditure, and not just  because\r\n\r\nthere  is  a vote, therefore, we should spend it wildly. The Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry's  Report  on  Vocational and Technical Education  which  has  been\r\n\r\ntabled  in  the Assembly does give an indication of the repercussions  that\r\n\r\nwill take place in the education system of Singapore Whereby it is intended\r\n\r\nthat one half of primary school leavers would be given vocational education\r\n\r\nin  secondary schools; so that for the time being, although we  call  these\r\n\r\nschools post primary schools, this is only a transitional arrangement. When\r\n\r\nthe Government publishes its White Paper to indicate how far it is prepared\r\n\r\nto  accept  the recommendations of this Commission of Inquiry's Report,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  in  a position to go full steam ahead. That is why for  the  post\r\n\r\nprimary schools - or to be more up to date, the secondary vocational schools - we  shall not actually spend the sum of $243,000 until we have decided  how\r\n\r\nfar  we  are prepared to purchase the equipment for these schools  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the furniture and equipment for secondary schools this year,\r\n\r\nwhere there was a vote of $822,000 and only $47,000 has been spent, here\r\n\r\nagain  the building programme has not progressed as fast as we had hoped,\r\n\r\nand  unless there are new secondary schools available for which we  would\r\n\r\nhave  to supply furniture and equipment, there is no reason why we should\r\n\r\njust  use the money to buy furniture and equipment and keep it in storage\r\n\r\nuntil the buildings are available. So we may as well defer spending  this\r\n\r\nmoney  and  push it on to next year when, as the Member for  Havelock  is\r\n\r\naware,  we  will have reached a stage where the Government is practically\r\n\r\nopening  one new school every month. So I think late in 1962, I hope  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Havelock will not complain that the Ministry of Education  is\r\n\r\nspending money too quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one small point that I have\r\n\r\nleft out.

It seems that  this  item\r\n\r\nprovided for a vote of $37,000 for the Teachers' Training College, but  I\r\n\r\ncould not find it in the 1962 Budget.

So I hope the Minister will give  an\r\n\r\nexplanation  for this. That is my first point. Since the Government  is  em\r\n\r\nphasising the raising of the standard of technical education of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, how much work has the Government done in this respect? It is\r\n\r\nuseless  to talk about how to raise the standard and how to train technical\r\n\r\npersonnel and not do anything about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, Phase I - Workshop building at the Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic - it would appear that, according to the Public Works Department,\r\n\r\nthis workshop will not be completed until well into 1962. They have spent a\r\n\r\nsum of $300,000, and therefore .there is this revote of $700,000 to make it\r\n\r\na full $1 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second question raised by 1h Member for Havelock regarding the\r\n\r\ntraining  of  technical  staff,  the  lack  of  technical  staff  and  what\r\n\r\nGovernment proposes to do to remedy this deficiency, Sir, this is a  world-wide problem. Every country is seeking the services of technical men and it\r\n\r\ntakes  time to train people to become technical men. I suppose we  have  to\r\n\r\ntry  somehow to make do; exhaust all possibilities; sometimes import people\r\n\r\nfrom outside. I suppose we have to consider paying them reasonable salaries\r\n\r\nto  attract them to work in this country and just make the best we  can  in\r\n\r\nthe circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we are raising, this\r\n\r\nquestion  because  the  Government is always saying that  the  shortage  of\r\n\r\ntechnical  personnel is a world-wide problem in order to evade the  answer.\r\n\r\nThis is not enough. The main thing is that we must make efforts to overcome\r\n\r\nthis  problem.  If  all  the time we say there is a shortage  of  technical\r\n\r\npersonnel and scientists and it is a world-wide problem, it is no  solution\r\n\r\nto  the  question itself. But at least we must do something about it.  From\r\n\r\nthese Development Estimates we can see that the Government is not doing its\r\n\r\npart well.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am sure the Government, of which the Member for\r\n\r\nHavelock  was  a  member  until recently, will be  very  pleased  to  hear\r\n\r\nconstructive proposals from the Member for Havelock as to how to meet this\r\n\r\nsituation. If he can put up proposals, we will be very glad to  take  heed\r\n\r\nof them and even adopt them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, just now we have heard\r\n\r\nmy colleague, the Member for Havelock, asking the Minister for Education a\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the $1 million provided, the Government has spent only $300,000. Now\r\n\r\nwhat  we are concerned about is whether the number of new students  to  be\r\n\r\nrecruited for the technical schools next year will be reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point we are concerned about is whether the students who have\r\n\r\npassed out can meet the requirements in the practical field. If we do  not\r\n\r\nhave  a  good workshop, then I believe that the students passing out  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  able to meet the requirements in the technical field.  Since  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has a provision of $1 million, it already has a good plan. That\r\n\r\nis why it is shown in these Estimates for the approval of the House. It is\r\n\r\nup to the Government to have a plan and the Member for Havelock should not\r\n\r\nhave  been  asked  to  make proposals. If the hon.  Member  were  to  make\r\n\r\nproposals, the Government may say, \"The proposals suggested by the  Member\r\n\r\nare  not  the  same as those we have in mind.\" So I feel that  it  is  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of the Ministry of Education to find a way  to  build  the\r\n\r\nworkshop  as  soon  as  possible in order to help  ease  the  shortage  of\r\n\r\ntechnical  personnel. We know that technical schools are  very  important.\r\n\r\nThe  establishment  of the Singapore Polytechnic is also  very  important.\r\n\r\nThat is the main reason why the question has been raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nHavelock.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I want the Minister to assure us that this workshop will be completed\r\n\r\nas scheduled.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, it is surprising how people on the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis side expect things to be done by just waving a magic wand.

It takes  time  to  put  up  a\r\n\r\nbuilding or a workshop. You do not just stand up and shout. Plans  have  to\r\n\r\nbe  drawn up and it takes months to do the necessary things.

Now if you have a plan but you do not carry it out,  it  is\r\n\r\nuseless. What is the point of having figures!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I feel that the Minister's reply is not sincere. In all sincerity, we\r\n\r\nhave  raised  this question in the hope that the Government  will  complete\r\n\r\nthis  work  as  scheduled.

So long as the completion of school buildings can keep pace  with\r\n\r\nthe  demand  for new places, I would say that the responsibility  of   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education has been fully discharged.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, all this goes to show that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has not carried out its development plan. In the case  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education, an examination will show that the  plan  for  the\r\n\r\nbuilding of schools in 1960 was not carried out.. The development plan  on\r\n\r\neducation  has consumed only less than 30 per cent of the estimate.  That\r\n\r\nis why I am pointing out that the Government has not done enough. There is\r\n\r\nno point in talking about propaganda.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1962, we have facts and figures and we can tell from them that in\r\n\r\nthe  course  of  the last 2\u00bd years, the Government has not done  anything\r\n\r\nabout the Development Plan. If we carefully review the whole situation in\r\n\r\nthe  light of the 1962 Estimates, then more than half of the work has not\r\n\r\nbeen done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been accused of repeating the same questions.\r\n\r\nI  have done so because I want it to be known that the Government has  not\r\n\r\ndischarged its duty with regard to the Development, Plan. We have  given\r\n\r\nthe  money  to  the  Government but it is clear that it  has    not  done\r\n\r\nanything.  If  anybody looks at the Development Estimates carefully,  this\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs  cannot  be denied. We are  not  trying  to  carry  out\r\n\r\npropaganda  work. It is all very obvious. The facts and  figures  are  in\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates. The Minister for Finance is a Doctor of Economics and  I\r\n\r\nwas nothing but a middle school student; therefore, it can be said that  I\r\n\r\ndo  not know very much about these things. This has been the attitude of\r\n\r\nthe  Government all along.

If one gets to  that  point,\r\n\r\nSir,  at,  say, between half-past seven and eight o'clock in the  morning,\r\n\r\nthere  is  absolute pandemonium there. The whole system of roads there  is\r\n\r\nsuch  that  it is very difficult to control traffic. Unless  one  has  two\r\n\r\ntraffic policemen spaced at, I think, literally 20 yards, Mr\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, it is just impossible to do anything with the  traffic  in\r\n\r\nthat  area. The roads in that area have been built up in such a way  that\r\n\r\nwith the housing development along Thomson Road (Sembawang Hills Estate),\r\n\r\nthat  road  carries  a lot of traffic. Just when it  is  about  time  for\r\n\r\nschool,  it is impossible to do anything about that place unless one  has\r\n\r\ntwo or three traffic policemen controlling two or three points - one on one\r\n\r\nside of the bridge, the other on the other side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the Government's suggestion to improve Jambatan Merah in\r\n\r\n1962 - the  vote is $180,000. But I do suggest to the Government  that  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  the  expansion of the bridge is intimately linked  with  the\r\n\r\ngyratory  system at that place. It seems pointless to expand  the  bridge\r\n\r\nwithout  doing something about the gyratory system. I do ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  consider  the  widening of Jambatan Merah  in  conjunction  with  the\r\n\r\ninstallation  of  a gyratory system at that place. Just  to  enlarge  the\r\n\r\nbridge without doing something about the gyratory system is, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I think a waste of time and money. So I do ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nhe  will give consideration to the construction at Jambatan Merah in 1962\r\n\r\nfor the sum allocated and ask his officers whether they will not propound\r\n\r\na  scheme for the gyratory system at Thomson/Norfolk/Kampong Java  Roads.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Minister  will look at some of the old files  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust, I think he will find plans in connection with this.

At Circular Road, $20,000 has been  provided  for\r\n\r\nflood alleviation work. But then only $10,000 was spent. And this sum  was\r\n\r\nspent  only during the Hong Lim by-election. When the P.A.P. was defeated,\r\n\r\nthe  remaining work to the value of $15,000 was not carried  out.  It  was\r\n\r\ncancelled.  If I were to enumerate every item; then this would  dishearten\r\n\r\neverybody,  because this will only show that the Government has  not  done\r\n\r\nits work well.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is all on the point that the Government has not enough\r\n\r\nof work.

The fact that the whole  of  a\r\n\r\ncertain vote has not been spent in that year is no indication at all  about\r\n\r\nthe  state  of  completion  of this particular work.  For  one  thing,  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  accounts  had not been closed at the time these  Estimates  were\r\n\r\nprepared. A lot of the figures entered there were very likely in the nature\r\n\r\nof  estimates of what the vote condition would be by the end of  the  year.\r\n\r\nBefore  we  could  draw  any  inference  from  any  particular  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure, we must take into account the amount revoted. I have  gene  to\r\n\r\ngreat lengths to explain that development expenditure is less easy to  fore\r\n\r\ncast  in  advance than ordinary estimates, because the date  of  completion\r\n\r\ncannot  be estimated so accurately in advance. It depends on how you deploy\r\n\r\nyour  engineers; how quickly tenders are put out; and how fast the work  is\r\n\r\ncompleted.  Sometimes work is held up because of the weather. Sometimes  it\r\n\r\nis  because  the  originating Ministries or departments put in  last-minute\r\n\r\nchanges in designs and so forth. Therefore, merely to draw an inference, as\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Havelock has been doing during the whole of the  two  days'\r\n\r\ndebate  on the Estimates, from the figure put in under the amount estimated\r\n\r\nto  be  spent in 1961, is completely erroneous. Anyone with a knowledge  of\r\n\r\nthe  simple  elements of financial procedure will know that the  Member  is\r\n\r\njust doing the wrong thing, a thing he would not have done if he had learnt\r\n\r\nhis job properly when he was Parliamentary Secretary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

In 1961 the Government asked the House to approve $3  million  on\r\n\r\nthese  flood  alleviation  schemes.  But  the  Government  has  only  spent\r\n\r\n$1,400,000  on  these  schemes. Mr Speaker, Sir, the flood  situation  has\r\n\r\nbecome more and more serious in Singapore. At present we in Singapore  have\r\n\r\nwater  rationing.  But  when there is a little  rainfall  many  places  are\r\n\r\nflooded. Perhaps when your car comes from Bukit Timah, it will not be  able\r\n\r\nto pass certain areas because of the flood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Government must double its efforts to carry\r\n\r\nout  these flood alleviation schemes, because if there are no such  schemes\r\n\r\nthere are many farmers and people whose property will be swept away by  the\r\n\r\nfloods.  Therefore, I hope the Government will expedite  its  efforts  this\r\n\r\nyear  to  carry out this work so as to alleviate or stop the flooding,  and\r\n\r\nthus  prevent loss of property. Their livelihood will be protected and they\r\n\r\nwill not suffer any loss.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The debate ranges over items (4), (5), (6) and (7).

Mr Tan Kia Gan, on the\r\n\r\ngeneral question of flood alleviation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, under subhead 14, flood alleviation, we see items\r\n\r\non  Bukit Timah Flood Alleviation? Schemes; Drainage of Catchment  Areas,\r\n\r\nSingapore River and Sungei Ulu Pandan; Geylang Flood Alleviation  Scheme:\r\n\r\nGeylang  River - Concrete Lining; Radin Mas/Nelson Road  Flood  Alleviation\r\n\r\nScheme. These are major flood alleviation schemes and mainly in the  town\r\n\r\narea. When the Member for Choa Chu Kang talked about flood alleviation in\r\n\r\nthe  town  areas,  he  mentioned farmers and other things.  This  has  no\r\n\r\nconnection  with  the  farming  areas. In  fact,  as  far  as  the  flood\r\n\r\nalleviation  schemes are concerned, when , they are major schemes,  plans\r\n\r\nhave to be made. In the case of the Bukit Timah Flood Alleviation Scheme,\r\n\r\nas  I  mentioned just now, an alternative scheme has been devised.  Under\r\n\r\nthe  new  proposal, the water of the Bukit Timah Canal will be  diverted.\r\n\r\nInstead of allowing it to come down to the city, it is now to be diverted\r\n\r\nat the 6\u00bd milestone to the Ulu Pandan Canal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> When will that be built?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> You can ask that question later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have enough of questions.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> About the Geylang Flood Alleviation Scheme, we have met\r\n\r\nwith some snap speakers. This area, in which a flood canal will be dug from\r\n\r\na  point south of Airport Road to Geylang Serai and connecting finally with\r\n\r\nGeylang River near Geylang Road, is a very congested area, and negotiations\r\n\r\nwill  have  to take place to move out the settlers. It will take some  time\r\n\r\nbefore the plan could be carried out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another flood alleviation scheme in which we have to do some\r\n\r\nconcrete  lining of the Geylang River. Part of this has been  finished  and\r\n\r\nthe  other part will be done next year. In the Nelson Road/Radin Mas  area,\r\n\r\nthe  first part of the scheme was completed in 1960. The second part of the\r\n\r\nwork  was  started in April this year and will be completed  in  June  next\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government took office in 1959, it has been paying attention to\r\n\r\nflood  alleviation, and in various areas flooding is a matter of the  past.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, Sir, in the Kampong Bahru area two big canals have been dug,\r\n\r\ncosting over $1 million. Work has been completed and flooding is no  longer\r\n\r\na  curse  there.  In  Orchard Road and Scotts Road, the  flood  alleviation\r\n\r\nscheme  has been finalised and there is no longer any flooding. In  certain\r\n\r\nparts  of Geylang Serai or Geylang area and Aljunied, the flood alleviation\r\n\r\nscheme  has been carried out and such areas are no longer flooded. I cannot\r\n\r\nsee  why  Members  opposite  should worry about  Government  pursuing  this\r\n\r\nsubject.
