The Government is indeed deeply saddened by\r\n\r\nthis  tragic  accident. I will now update the  House  on  the\r\n\r\nprogress  of the investigations. The Aviation Safety  Council\r\n\r\n(ASC)  of  Taiwan  is  leading the  investigations  into  the\r\n\r\naccident, with the support of experts from the USA, Singapore\r\n\r\nand Australia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  investigators will determine the cause of  the  accident\r\n\r\nand  recommend  measures to prevent future  occurrences.

Very rarely  does\r\n\r\nit  result  in  deaths.   However, on  the  morning  of  30th\r\n\r\nSeptember,  two  siblings aged one and two died,  within  two\r\n\r\nhours  of  each other.  Upon notification that  morning,  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Public Health immediately activated the  Task\r\n\r\nForce that was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nformed  two years ago following the outbreaks of HFMD in  the\r\n\r\nregion in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Task Force recommended the closure of all pre-schools effective from 2nd October. The objective was to\r\n\r\nisolate  the  children and protect them from contracting  the\r\n\r\ndisease.  The  Minister  for  the  Environment  accepted  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation. The directive went out immediately to all the\r\n\r\npre-schools on the same day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quick and decisive action by the Government,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the  concerted efforts of  the  public,  pre-schools,  media  and employers proved to be effective.  I  am\r\n\r\npleased  to  report to the House that the outbreak  has  been\r\n\r\nbrought  under control. The number of reported cases per  day\r\n\r\nreached  a peak of 258 on 4th October, and declined  steadily\r\n\r\nto  9  on  31st October. All pre-schools have reopened  since\r\n\r\n16th October. The situation is now back to normal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the multi-agency task force, I would like\r\n\r\nto  take this opportunity to thank the parents and members of\r\n\r\nthe public, pre-school and kindergarten teachers, doctors  at\r\n\r\nthe  Kandang Kerbau Women and Children Hospital, the National\r\n\r\nUniversity  Hospital,  the  Singapore  General  Hospital  and\r\n\r\ndoctors  in private practice, affected employers, and various\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies  for  their understanding,  support  and\r\n\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HFMD is spread through close contact among children. The\r\n\r\nmost  effective  measure to prevent future  outbreaks  is  to\r\n\r\nmaintain a high standard of hygiene in pre-school centres and\r\n\r\nat  home.  Parents and teachers also need to remain vigilant,\r\n\r\nand  keep  infected  children away from other  children.  The\r\n\r\nmulti-agency   task   force  will  continue   to   strengthen\r\n\r\nguidelines  relating  to  hygiene  standards  and  sick   bay\r\n\r\noperations to prevent future outbreaks as much as we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, is the Minister\r\n\r\nconfirming that we have completely eliminated or at least  we\r\n\r\nhave brought it down to the level that it was at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  previous  outbreak  status in terms  of  the  number  of\r\n\r\nchildren contracting the disease?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of precaution, is the Minister saying that just\r\n\r\ncleanliness  and hygiene is an issue or can we actually  take\r\n\r\nother  medical  precautions  to  prevent  our  children  from\r\n\r\ncontracting this disease in the first place?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Acting Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, the hand, foot and mouth disease is an endemic\r\n\r\ndisease, ie, it is there all the time.  Last year, before  we\r\n\r\nimposed  the  compulsory reporting of HFMD, we had  about  25\r\n\r\ncases  a week.  During the recent outbreak, it went up to  as\r\n\r\nhigh  as 258 cases per day.  Since then, it has come down  to\r\n\r\nabout  10 cases per day.  10 cases per day will work  out  to\r\n\r\nabout  70 cases per week.  It would appear to be still higher\r\n\r\nthan the 25 cases per week last year.  However, there was  no\r\n\r\ncompulsory  reporting  last  year  whereas  today  there   is\r\n\r\ncompulsory reporting.  Our assessment is that at 10 cases per\r\n\r\nday, we are now back to the normal situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also asked whether beyond cleanliness,\r\n\r\nis  there a medical solution.  Sir, at this moment, there  is\r\n\r\nno  medical  cure  to the hand, foot and  mouth  disease,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  the  EV71  virus.   There  is  also  no  vaccine\r\n\r\navailable.   However, I want to highlight that  when  we  say\r\n\r\n\"there is no cure\", it does not mean that every child who has\r\n\r\ncontracted the disease will face the danger of death.   As an\r\n\r\nillustration, in the outbreak in Taiwan, there were about 1.4\r\n\r\nmillion  cases and over 70 death cases, ie, one casualty  out\r\n\r\nof  20,000 cases.  I want to emphasise that there is no  need\r\n\r\nfor  the  public to be alarmed that the hand, foot and  mouth\r\n\r\ndisease is there all the time.  What is important is  for  us\r\n\r\nto continue to take measures to reduce the number and to keep\r\n\r\nit  to  as low as possible, bearing in mind that this disease\r\n\r\nis, generally speaking, not harmful.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> May I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether, for the control\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the disease spread, child care centre operators are being\r\n\r\nfacilitated  by  his Ministry on correct maintenance  of  the\r\n\r\nchild  care  centres  and  on the  proper  screening  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents in the centres?  May I also ask whether there  is  a\r\n\r\nnew  protocol  for  vigilance and pro-active  closing  of  an\r\n\r\ninfected centre to curb the disease spread and also  avoid  a\r\n\r\nnation-wide closure of the child care centres in the future?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two types of\r\n\r\npre-school  centres in Singapore.  They are the kindergartens\r\n\r\nand  the  child  care centres.  The child  care  centres  are\r\n\r\nlicensed by the Ministry of Community Development and  Sports\r\n\r\n(MCDS)  and  the kindergartens by the Ministry of  Education.\r\n\r\nBoth  types  of pre-school centres are subjected  to  hygiene\r\n\r\nguidelines   issued  by  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment,\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education and MCDS.  In fact, the last  time  we\r\n\r\nupdated  our guidelines was in March this year.  As a  result\r\n\r\nof the recent outbreak, the Task Force has decided to further\r\n\r\nupdate  the  guidelines.  A new set  of  guidelines  will  be\r\n\r\nissued soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dr Lily Neo's second question regarding the screening\r\n\r\nof  children, it is true that many teachers and parents  were\r\n\r\nnot aware of the proper actions to be taken during the recent\r\n\r\noutbreak.   What has happened was that we actually had  cases\r\n\r\nof  children  who  had contracted the hand,  foot  and  mouth\r\n\r\ndisease  but continued to attend school.  For the child  care\r\n\r\ncentres, sick bay is a standard facility. We do not have much\r\n\r\nproblem because the infected children are isolated.   But  in\r\n\r\nthe  case of kindergartens, there is no practice of having  a\r\n\r\nsick bay.  As a result, some of the children were allowed  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to interact with the other children.  As a result of\r\n\r\nthe  recent outbreak, we have now issued clear guidelines  to\r\n\r\nall  kindergartens that for those without  sick bay facility,\r\n\r\nthey  would  still  have to isolate the children,  using  the\r\n\r\nprincipal's office or any other facility.  At the same  time,\r\n\r\nthey  have to notify the parents immediately.  This  practice\r\n\r\nhas  been  put  in place.  Over the last one  month,  we  are\r\n\r\nseeing a very effective\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecline in the number of cases.  So we intend to continue  to\r\n\r\nenforce  such hygiene practices so that, hopefully,  we  will\r\n\r\nnot  see  another outbreak and we do not have  to  close  the\r\n\r\nschools in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  through  the process we have identified  any  highly\r\n\r\nsusceptible   facilities  like  sand  bays,  playgrounds   or\r\n\r\nswimming pools and so on, that are actually causing a  bigger\r\n\r\nprobability of this disease being spread and are we going  to\r\n\r\nreview   the   building  and  maintenance  policy   of   such\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question I have, which is still not very\r\n\r\nclear, is why we have had this disease at a steady state  and\r\n\r\nwhat was the reason for the sudden increase this time round.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, the spread of the disease is\r\n\r\nbasically  through  direct contact among the  children.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  if a child were to pick up a piece of toy and  puts\r\n\r\nit  into  his  or  her mouth and before the saliva  dries  up\r\n\r\nanother child picks it up and puts into his or her mouth,  it\r\n\r\ncan  be transmitted.  Therefore, in the case of sand bays and\r\n\r\nso  on,  it is probably not the primary mode of transmission.\r\n\r\nWhat we have done, as I have mentioned earlier, is to enforce\r\n\r\nthe  hygiene practices in the schools.  For example,  in  our\r\n\r\nhygiene guidelines, there is a clear regulation that all toys\r\n\r\nmust  be washed at the end of the day every day and any items\r\n\r\nwhere  the children can put into their mouth are not supposed\r\n\r\nto be placed in a common area for the children to share.  All\r\n\r\nthese guidelines will now be further enforced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the sudden increase, prior to 1st October, the\r\n\r\nhand,  foot  and mouth disease was not a notifiable  disease.\r\n\r\nAs  a result, we have to rely on the reporting from the child\r\n\r\ncare  centres.  The  information  we  were  getting  was  not\r\n\r\ncomplete  and not up to date.  Since 1st October  this  year,\r\n\r\nall  hand,  foot  and mouth disease cases  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nreported  because it is now a notifiable infectious  disease.\r\n\r\nHenceforth,  we  should  be  able to  monitor  very  closely.\r\n\r\nShould there be any increase, we will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nable to take responsive action before it gets out of control.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister what was the reason\r\n\r\nfor  the long delay in confirming the diagnosis of the recent\r\n\r\nhand, foot and mouth disease occurrence, whether there is now\r\n\r\nan  improved channel for speedier laboratory confirmation  of\r\n\r\nthe  hand,  foot and mouth virus, and whether  this  virology\r\n\r\ntesting  is available to all doctors for earlier and  correct\r\n\r\ndiagnosis?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the case of\r\n\r\nunnatural death, it is a standard practice that we will do  a\r\n\r\npost-mortem.   In the process, there are actually  two  steps\r\n\r\ninvolved.   The first step is to detect the presence  of  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  virus.  And the second step is to identify  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  strain of virus it is.  Take, for example, in the  case\r\n\r\nof the hand, foot and mouth disease, the most common virus is\r\n\r\nthe  family  under  the enterovirus, and there  are  over  60\r\n\r\ndifferent  strains.   Within a  few  days,  we  are  able  to\r\n\r\nidentify the presence of enterovirus.  But the next  step  is\r\n\r\nto  identify  if it is a coxsackie A16 or EV71, or  something\r\n\r\nelse.   For that to happen, the medical laboratory will  have\r\n\r\nto isolate the sample.  They have to culture the virus to see\r\n\r\nwhether there are any reactions.  So that typically will take\r\n\r\na few weeks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to give you an example. We actually did the\r\n\r\nisolation in parallel in a Singapore facility as well  as  to\r\n\r\nsend  a  sample to the CDC (Communicable Disease  Centre)  in\r\n\r\nAtlanta.   In  fact, both centres identified the presence  of\r\n\r\nEV71  almost  at the same time.  It shows that there  was  no\r\n\r\ndelay  on  our  part,  because even  with  a  very  reputable\r\n\r\nfacility in Atlanta, it takes about the same time.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have to go through that period of time  for  the\r\n\r\nvirus to be cultured, to be grown, and to be identified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to assure the public that we do have an up-to-date facility and that there was no delay in identifying\r\n\r\nthe  virus.  Unfortunately, the process does take time.   But\r\n\r\nhaving  said that, it does not mean that we will not  further\r\n\r\ninvest in upgrading our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapability.

When  this  Committee  was\r\n\r\nformed, oil prices were low at about US$15 per barrel.   This\r\n\r\nshows that the Committee was formed at a time when the prices\r\n\r\nwere  low and there was no knee jerk reaction to the  present\r\n\r\nenergy prices.  But now that it has gone up to over US$30 per\r\n\r\nbarrel, the need to act on energy conservation has become all\r\n\r\nthe more urgent and important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IACEE has completed its study and released its\r\n\r\nrecommendations  to  the  media  in  May  this   year.    The\r\n\r\nrecommendations  are wide-ranging, long term and  attainable.\r\n\r\nVarious   agencies  are  working  towards   achieving   these\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  In summary, Sir, these include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing and developing building regulations on energy\r\n\r\nefficiency by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA);\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding the Green Labelling Scheme under the Singapore\r\n\r\nEnvironment Council\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich   works  in  cooperation  with  the  Ministry  of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment (ENV).

But these are bottomline\r\n\r\nfocused  MNCs, so they know what they are doing.   And  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that  they would have factored the cost of energy  into\r\n\r\ntheir  production, because they need to compete on  a  world-wide  basis.   But  we  found that  most  of  the  energy  is\r\n\r\nchannelled through air-conditioning as well as refrigeration.\r\n\r\nSo\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  commercial and residential sectors have  more  scope  to\r\n\r\nimprove their energy efficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the recommendations, whether they are achievable or\r\n\r\nattainable,  yes,  of course they are.

So  the scope for improvement  may  be  limited.\r\n\r\nBut,  nonetheless, we are attempting for a start to band  the\r\n\r\nenergy  efficiency of all the bigger public  buildings.   The\r\n\r\nBCA  has  compiled an initial list and it would be circulated\r\n\r\ninternally   to   all  the  various  statutory   boards   and\r\n\r\nMinistries.

I think it is a happy state of affairs,  in\r\n\r\nsome ways.  But it is also incumbent upon the HDB now, with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nslowing  demand  and with greater control over  the  building\r\n\r\nprogramme, to be able to monitor more closely the progress of\r\n\r\nthe  building programme and to therefore give a more accurate\r\n\r\nassessment, as the Member has mentioned just now.

May I ask the Minister  to\r\n\r\nextend this to 5-room flats too?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, this change or revision to the\r\n\r\npolicy  of allowing the deposit of 20% to be split  into  two\r\n\r\ninstalments was primarily to allow younger couples   who  are\r\n\r\nnot  able to afford the 20% downpayment to therefore get  the\r\n\r\nHDB  flat, as it were.  The reason why the decision was taken\r\n\r\nto  restrict this concession to the 4-room flats was that  if\r\n\r\nyou  are  actually applying for a 5-room flat  and  therefore\r\n\r\nyour  deposit is larger, then affordability should not be  in\r\n\r\nthe picture.  Therefore, in so far as this being a concession\r\n\r\nis  concerned, the relaxation is only for the 4-roomers.

So the average household size over the last  10\r\n\r\nto  15 years has come down, to around four today and, if  the\r\n\r\ntrend persists, to something less than four.  That is one  of\r\n\r\nthe  changes  that is taking place that HDB  has  taken  into\r\n\r\naccount  in  its building programme.

The survey results are published in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Yearbook of Manpower Statistics, the Quarterly\r\n\r\nLabour Market Report, as well as in ad hoc reports.  MOM also\r\n\r\nconducts  the Manpower and Skills Needs Survey on a bi-annual\r\n\r\nbasis  to  assess the employment outlook and skills needs  of\r\n\r\nvarious industries for the next two years.

We also  monitor  and\r\n\r\nactively seek feedback from companies and workers to identify\r\n\r\nemerging   problems.   All  these  channels,  from   official\r\n\r\nsurveys,  links with economic agencies and interactions  with\r\n\r\ncompanies, have enabled MOM to identify short and medium term\r\n\r\nmanpower  needs  in various industries.

This  includes\r\n\r\nwelcoming and facilitating skilled foreigners coming here  to\r\n\r\nwork.   For  such  skilled  global  talents  coming  here  on\r\n\r\nEmployment  Passes,  we  do  not have  any  cap  or  sectoral\r\n\r\nlimitation.  In the case of semi-skilled or unskilled foreign\r\n\r\nworkers,  we will have to take a more balanced approach.   We\r\n\r\nalready have more than 450,000 low-skilled foreign workers in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Unlimited inflow of low-skilled foreign  workers\r\n\r\nis  not sustainable and may undermine economic restructuring.\r\n\r\nEmployers  with easy access to low cost foreign  workers  may\r\n\r\nlose  the  incentive  to invest in labour-saving  technology,\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  workforce development, or re-engineer  their\r\n\r\nwork  processes to address their manpower needs.   There  are\r\n\r\nalso serious social and political costs in admitting too many\r\n\r\nforeign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore adopted a more holistic approach to\r\n\r\naddress industries' skilled and unskilled manpower needs.  In\r\n\r\nresponse  to  the  shortage of IT workers,  for  example,  we\r\n\r\nlaunched  the Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme  (Info-comm) to encourage the conversion of local non-IT workers  to\r\n\r\ntake  up IT jobs.  This complements the liberal admission  of\r\n\r\nforeign  talents  in  this  area.  The  Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme  has  been extended to cover training  of  cleaning\r\n\r\nworkers,  health  assistants and nurses,  and  other  sectors\r\n\r\nfacing   labour  shortage.

However,  public\r\n\r\nfeedback raised concerns that with a single COE category  for\r\n\r\ncars,  buyers  of smaller cars were likely to  be  outbid  by\r\n\r\nbuyers  of  big  and  luxury cars.  The  Committee  therefore\r\n\r\nrecommended  that  the merger of categories  should  be  done\r\n\r\ngradually and, as an intermediate step, recommended that  the\r\n\r\nfour car categories be merged to form the two categories.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 12 months, the COE prices of Category B\r\n\r\nwere generally higher or comparable to the prices of Category\r\n\r\nA  except on a few occasions, such as in the October  tender,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  COE  price of Category B fell substantially  below\r\n\r\nthat  of Category A.  This can happen and does happen because\r\n\r\nin  a  closed  bidding  system, bidders  are  not  given  any\r\n\r\ninformation  when  the bidding is in progress  and  they  are\r\n\r\ntherefore  unable  to  follow  up  when  the  demand  for   a\r\n\r\nparticular category of COE is weak vis-a-vis the supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority will be implementing the\r\n\r\nopen bidding system for COEs as a trial in the 2nd quarter of\r\n\r\nnext  year.   With the open bidding system, bidders  will  be\r\n\r\nable to see the going prices during the bidding exercises and\r\n\r\nmake informed decisions when bidding COEs.  This will help to\r\n\r\nreduce wide fluctuations in COE prices like the sharp fall in\r\n\r\nCategory B COE price in the October bidding exercise or  when\r\n\r\nthe  price  for  the big car COE fell to $50 previously.   We\r\n\r\nshould  therefore review whether to merge  the  two  car  COE\r\n\r\ncategories  into  one  after we implement  the  open  bidding\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, with the information available in\r\n\r\nthe open bidding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem, is it not equivalent to having a single category  for\r\n\r\nall cars?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, it depends on the\r\n\r\nreactions  of  the  bidders.  If they  choose  to  bid  in  a\r\n\r\nparticular  category  because  they  just  want  to   buy   a\r\n\r\nparticular  category car, then it may not be.   But  if  they\r\n\r\nchoose to buy any car as long as its COE price is the lowest,\r\n\r\nthen perhaps what the Member said is true.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, would the Minister of State agree\r\n\r\nthat in the previous discussion on this topic, the merger  of\r\n\r\ncategories allows buyers a greater freedom to buy  cars?   As\r\n\r\nsuch,  open bidding with the information available  seems  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the  segregation of categories  is  no  longer\r\n\r\nnecessary.

The pest birds  would\r\n\r\nreturn to the roost when the trees regain their foliage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more long-term and effective solution is to reduce the\r\n\r\neasy availability of food sources.  The Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment has taken measures to require food stalls, shops\r\n\r\nand households to store their refuse in covered bins to keep\r\n\r\nthem away from birds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise the bird nuisance problems more effectively\r\n\r\nin  the  long run, we will also need the cooperation  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.

The Bill  before\r\n\r\nthe  House today represents the outcome of the review of  the\r\n\r\ncompany legislation since then.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater part of the present Bill is devoted to the\r\n\r\ndisclosure  requirements in the Companies Act for  offers  or\r\n\r\ninvitations   to  the  public  in  respect  of   shares   and\r\n\r\ndebentures.    This  is  essentially  in  response   to   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Corporate Finance Committee  (CFC)  to\r\n\r\nmake  Singapore  a  key  financial centre  for  international\r\n\r\ncorporate  fund-raising activity.  The  main  thrust  of  the\r\n\r\nCorporate   Finance  Committee's  recommendations   is   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  shift  from merit-based  regulation  to  a\r\n\r\ndisclosure-based  regulatory regime  to  promote  innovation,\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship, efficiency and business flexibility,  while\r\n\r\nprotecting the integrity of the securities market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the present Bill seeks to improve\r\n\r\nprovisions  relating  to the disclosure requirements  in  the\r\n\r\nCompanies  Act, exemptions from such disclosure requirements,\r\n\r\nthe  penalties  for  breach  of disclosure  requirements  and\r\n\r\nsubmissions  of  financial statements.

Clause  5\r\n\r\nrepeals  and  re-enacts  section 45 to  replace  the  current\r\n\r\nchecklist approach with a general test of what investors  and\r\n\r\ntheir  professional  advisers  would  expect  to  find  in  a\r\n\r\nprospectus to make an informed investment decision.  The  new\r\n\r\nprovision  provides for the general disclosure  test  in  the\r\n\r\nmain Act whilst retaining the Fifth Schedule as a checklist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 45A will be introduced under clause 6 to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  a  mini-prospectus or a  profile  statement  in\r\n\r\naddition to a prospectus, subject to certain conditions.  The\r\n\r\nprofile  statement will be an abridged version  of  the  full\r\n\r\nprospectus.  It is meant to provide essential information  at\r\n\r\na glance, and make the information easier to read and digest.\r\n\r\nInvestors  who  wish to do so can still  refer  to  the  full\r\n\r\nprospectus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another step to improve the disclosure requirement is to\r\n\r\nallow  the  issuance  and  lodgment  of  a  supplementary  or\r\n\r\nreplacement document after the original prospectus  has  been\r\n\r\nlodged.   This is provided under clause 10, which  inserts  a\r\n\r\nnew  section 50A that specifies the circumstances under which\r\n\r\na  supplementary  or a replacement document could  be  lodged\r\n\r\nwith  the  Registrar  and issued to the public.  This  is  to\r\n\r\nenable the issuer to update or rectify any statement that has\r\n\r\nalready  been  made  in  a prospectus or  profile  statement.\r\n\r\nCurrently, issuers have to either issue a fresh prospectus or\r\n\r\npress advertisement to inform investors of such changes.

This allows the Registrar  to  grant  blanket\r\n\r\nexemptions  and stipulate the conditions to be complied  with\r\n\r\nfor the issue of \"preliminary\" prospectus, used by issuers to\r\n\r\ngauge market interest before the actual issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 amends section 119 to allow any person or\r\n\r\nclass  of persons to seek exemption from compliance with  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  relating  to interests other  than  shares  and\r\n\r\ndebentures.

Section 55B provides\r\n\r\nfor the defences to persons potentially liable for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe prospectus or profile statement under section 55(1).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 repeals and re-enacts section 56 to provide\r\n\r\nfor criminal liability for false or misleading statements, or\r\n\r\nomissions  in  a prospectus or profile statement,  which  are\r\n\r\nmaterially adverse from the viewpoint of an investor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Improvements on submission of financial statements</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 20, 21 and 22 seek to improve the submission of\r\n\r\nfinancial statements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 introduces a new section 200(2A) to allow a\r\n\r\nsubsidiary, which is a foreign company, to end its  financial\r\n\r\nyear  within two months before its holding company.  This  is\r\n\r\nto facilitate timely reporting of group accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 amends section 201 to shorten the time given\r\n\r\nfor   publicly  listed  companies  to  present  their  annual\r\n\r\nreports.   Instead of the current 6 months, a  public  listed\r\n\r\ncompany must now present its profit and loss account not more\r\n\r\nthan  five  months  after the financial year-end.  Clause  22\r\n\r\namends  section  201A to allow the Registrar  to  exempt  the\r\n\r\ndirectors  of  a  holding  company from  complying  with  the\r\n\r\nrequirement for consolidated accounts to be issued only after\r\n\r\nreceiving  the  accounts of subsidiaries.   This  will  allow\r\n\r\nauditors   to  express  their  opinion  on  the  consolidated\r\n\r\nfinancial  statements  of the subsidiaries  without  all  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  statements of the subsidiaries having been  signed\r\n\r\noff by their respective auditors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extension of Buy-back Provisions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides all these changes to the disclosure\r\n\r\nrequirements, we are also making some amendments to the other\r\n\r\nsegments.   Let me now turn to the extension of the  buy-back\r\n\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, companies are allowed to buy back up to 10%\r\n\r\nof  their issued ordinary share capital within a period of 12\r\n\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClause 13 amends section 76B to extend the share buy-back  to\r\n\r\npreference  shares, both redeemable and non-redeemable.   The\r\n\r\npurpose  is to give companies more flexibility in determining\r\n\r\ntheir  capital  structures and improving  the  efficiency  of\r\n\r\ntheir capital deployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no volume limit on the buy-back of\r\n\r\nredeemable preference shares as such shares are not part of a\r\n\r\ncompany's  permanent  capital.  In  contrast,  non-redeemable\r\n\r\npreference shares are part of a company's permanent  capital.\r\n\r\nHence,  they cannot be returned or otherwise cancelled except\r\n\r\nin  the  event of a capital reduction exercise or liquidation\r\n\r\nof  the company.  To protect the interests of creditors,  the\r\n\r\nsame  safeguards  for  the buy-back of ordinary  shares  will\r\n\r\napply  to  the buy-back of non-redeemable preference  shares.\r\n\r\nCompanies  will  be allowed to buy back up to  10%  of  their\r\n\r\nissued  non-redeemable  preference  share  capital  within  a\r\n\r\nperiod of 12 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Improvement on the Winding-up process of Companies and De-registration of Businesses</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the existing Companies Act and the Business\r\n\r\nRegistration  Act,  there are currently  provisions  for  the\r\n\r\nwinding-up  of  companies by the Court  and  cancellation  of\r\n\r\nbusinesses  by  the Registrar if the company or  business  is\r\n\r\nused  for  unlawful purposes, or for purposes prejudicial  to\r\n\r\npublic  peace,  welfare  or good  order,  or  on  grounds  of\r\n\r\nnational  security or interest.  However, the actual  process\r\n\r\nand  procedures of winding up or cancellation are  not  spelt\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments seek to make clearer the\r\n\r\ncircumstances under which a company or business may be  wound\r\n\r\nup  on grounds of national security or interest.  The winding\r\n\r\nup  process  in the Companies Act as well as the cancellation\r\n\r\nprocess   under  the  Business  Registration  Act   will   be\r\n\r\nharmonised  with the dissolution process under the  Societies\r\n\r\nAct.   It  clearly  spells out that  the  Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  is  the definitive authority on what  constitutes  a\r\n\r\nthreat to national security or interest, and the process by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich such companies or businesses can be wound up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Miscellaneous Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other miscellaneous amendments are essentially to\r\n\r\nupdate  the  Act, streamline the procedures  and  to  clarify\r\n\r\nexisting  provisions.  These include amendments to allow  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  to  rectify  the  registers  where  there   is   a\r\n\r\ntypographical  or clerical error, to clarify that  no  person\r\n\r\nshall  make a public offer unless a prospectus or  a  profile\r\n\r\nstatement  has been registered with RCB, and that options  or\r\n\r\nwarrants would also require prospectuses if they are  offered\r\n\r\nto the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI wish to speak in support of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Second Minister for Finance has said, this Bill\r\n\r\nis  introduced  with the purpose of improving the  disclosure\r\n\r\nrequirements of public listed companies and thereby elevating\r\n\r\nthe  standards of corporate governance.  Sir, the  importance\r\n\r\nof  good corporate governance is well accepted.  Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister BG Lee Hsien Loong has said previously, and  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  just mentioned, that world class standards  of\r\n\r\ncorporate  governance are vital pre-requisites for  Singapore\r\n\r\nto become an international financial sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore to grow as a financial centre and to\r\n\r\nattract more foreign institutional investors, Singapore  will\r\n\r\nneed  to  have  a  high  standard  of  corporate  governance.\r\n\r\nHowever, I wish to remark that in Singapore's context,  there\r\n\r\nare  still  occasions when rumour-mongering has affected  the\r\n\r\nshare prices of some counters in the SGX which led to a  fair\r\n\r\namount  of speculative trading.  Recent examples are counters\r\n\r\nin  the  electronic sector where for many weeks,  there  have\r\n\r\nbeen rumours of takeover by foreign companies which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere   denied  by  the  companies  themselves.    Sir,   such\r\n\r\nundesirable  practices are detrimental to the good  image  of\r\n\r\nthe SGX.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that SGX should endeavour to\r\n\r\ncurb  such  speculative rumour-mongering and also  to  remind\r\n\r\ncompanies  to exercise due care in preserving price-sensitive\r\n\r\ninformation,  ensure early disclosure of any  price-sensitive\r\n\r\ninformation  or  discussions,  and  avoid  possible   insider\r\n\r\ntrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am in support of all the amendments that the\r\n\r\nMinister has explained earlier.  It is known that the MAS has\r\n\r\nset  up a few committees as part of the Government's plan  to\r\n\r\nreview  the corporate framework for good corporate governance\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   I  feel  that there is  one  proposal  which\r\n\r\ndeserves   serious   consideration   and   in   fact    quick\r\n\r\nimplementation, that is, to introduce quarterly reporting  of\r\n\r\nfinancial   statements  or  financial  results   for   listed\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Quarterly reporting has already been in place  in\r\n\r\nthe  USA  for  several years.  Malaysia has also  implemented\r\n\r\nthis policy from this year and it was implemented smoothly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that Singapore should also adopt\r\n\r\nthis  requirement of quarterly reporting so as to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe local companies will disclose their financial performance\r\n\r\non  a  more  regular basis.  Although this policy would  mean\r\n\r\nmore onerous accounting and reporting by companies, I believe\r\n\r\nit   will   ensure   more  transparency  of  the   companies'\r\n\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for the\r\n\r\nopportunity to speak on the Companies (Amendment) Bill  which\r\n\r\nI rise in support of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed, Sir, let me declare my interest in the\r\n\r\nsubject  matter.   As  a  practising solicitor,  I  have,  on\r\n\r\noccasions  and  from  time  to  time  in  the  course  of  my\r\n\r\nprofessional  work,  to  deal  with  the  provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act and its amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to improve, among other things, the\r\n\r\ndisclosure  requirements in the Act for offers or invitations\r\n\r\nto  the  public; the exemptions from disclosure  requirements\r\n\r\nand  to  widen the scope of the share buy-back provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe  Act.  I believe these amendments are part of the ongoing\r\n\r\nreview  and  reform which the Government is undertaking  with\r\n\r\nrespect to the Act and the other related legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I am agreeable to the efforts of the\r\n\r\nGovernment to improve the provisions of the Act, I do have  a\r\n\r\nnumber of concerns that are raised by the Bill and ones which\r\n\r\nI hope to canvass before this House today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, there is the issue of the public offer.\r\n\r\nOne appreciates that an underlying objective of the Act is to\r\n\r\nprotect  members  of the public from unscrupulous  promoters.\r\n\r\nHere  the  Act  makes a distinction between a  public  and  a\r\n\r\nprivate  offer.  Where an offer to apply for shares or  other\r\n\r\nrelevant securities is made to the public, the Act requires a\r\n\r\nfull disclosure of all material information in the form of  a\r\n\r\nprospectus  registered with the Registry of  Companies.   The\r\n\r\nsame,  however,  is not required in cases of private  offers;\r\n\r\npresumably because the public at large is not at risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, as with most other common law jurisdictions,\r\n\r\nuses  the concept of the \"public offer\" to determine  whether\r\n\r\nor  not  an offer of securities ought to be regulated by  the\r\n\r\nauthorities.   However, what constitutes  a  \"public  offer\"?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, \"public\" is an open textured word.  Except for\r\n\r\nvery specific exemptions, there is not much in the Act by way\r\n\r\nof  guidance  as  to the constitution of a public  offer.   A\r\n\r\nrandom  offer of securities to just one member of the  public\r\n\r\nwho  is  not known to the offeror may constitute an offer  to\r\n\r\nthe  public.  On the other hand, an offer that is made  to  a\r\n\r\nsizeable number of family members and friends, even if  these\r\n\r\npeople  are just acquaintances, are not typically treated  as\r\n\r\npublic  offers.   In the first instance, a  prospectus  filed\r\n\r\nwith the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegistry  is  necessary  whereas it  is  not  in  the  second\r\n\r\ninstance.   For  many,  it is often a  judgment  call  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether or not an offer to investors is really a public offer\r\n\r\nfor which a prospectus is required.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when you think of it, the distinction between a\r\n\r\npublic  offer  and a private offer is both an artificial  and\r\n\r\nunrealistic one.  Why should an offer randomly made  to  just\r\n\r\none member of the public be more deserving of protection than\r\n\r\nan  offer  made  to a wide group of people who are  tenuously\r\n\r\nlinked to the offeror?  From my limited experience, companies\r\n\r\nraising  funds often compile information memoranda  that  are\r\n\r\ncirculated  among interested parties.  I have  seen  many  of\r\n\r\nthese  documents  around.  Such documents  are  intended  for\r\n\r\nprivate circulation and consumption.  Often there are express\r\n\r\nwords to the effect that the information memorandum does  not\r\n\r\nconstitute a public offer and therefore is not registered  as\r\n\r\na prospectus for the purposes of the Act.  It seems that this\r\n\r\nis   an  accepted  practice  in  the  industry  in  order  to\r\n\r\ncircumvent,  rightly or wrongly, the prospectus  requirements\r\n\r\nof the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will appreciate that to prepare a fully\r\n\r\ncompliant  prospectus is both a costly and  labour  intensive\r\n\r\nexercise; and this is one reason why many promoters loathe to\r\n\r\nstray  into  areas  that require prospectus  filing  and  the\r\n\r\npreparation  of which is subject to extensive  due  diligence\r\n\r\nexercises, filing and declaration requirements.  In fact,  in\r\n\r\nrelation to the size of the capital to be raised, the  effort\r\n\r\nof  compiling  and filing a prospectus may not be  worth  the\r\n\r\nwhile.  Sometimes companies, especially the technology start-ups  that  do require capital are not the ones who are  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to pay for the high transactional costs  that  come\r\n\r\nwith  the  preparation of a prospectus.  I suspect  that  the\r\n\r\nreality  is  far from the ideal.  Many promoters, I  believe,\r\n\r\ncanvass the public widely for funds even if it was ostensibly\r\n\r\ndone in a private manner and without the proper filing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This difficulty is often compounded by the fact that the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  public  protection has  never  been  consistently\r\n\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor  now,  this  Bill recognises and seeks to protect,  in  a\r\n\r\nhighly  regulated and demanding manner, members of the public\r\n\r\nin respect of investments in securities.  However, Sir, as  I\r\n\r\nhave  maintained in previous sittings of this House,  such  a\r\n\r\nregiment  of  protection is not similarly  applied  in  other\r\n\r\nforms of investments.  I did mention in previous sittings  of\r\n\r\nthis  House about investment promotions in Singapore of  real\r\n\r\nestates  overseas,  of investments in time-share  apartments,\r\n\r\nand   of   purchases  of  ostrich  eggs,   as   examples   of\r\n\r\ninconsistency  with  which  the  subject  matter   has   been\r\n\r\napproached by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to decide on a consistent approach on the\r\n\r\nissue  of investor protection.  If the principle is one which\r\n\r\nI have heard before, and that is caveat emptor, then the same\r\n\r\napproach  should also be applied in the case of public  offer\r\n\r\nof securities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not just use the concept of a public offer as\r\n\r\nforming  the  basis of deciding whether or not  the  activity\r\n\r\nought  to be regulated.  Rather, we should consider the issue\r\n\r\nof  balance and proportion.  Does it make sense to go through\r\n\r\nthe  whole  routine of prospectus filing  for  a  small  fund\r\n\r\nraising exercise?  Are there alternative ways to raise  funds\r\n\r\nthat  would  afford  a  better level of  protection  for  the\r\n\r\ninvestors and yet at the same time not put too many obstacles\r\n\r\nand demands on the promoter?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Sir, there are some who are of the view\r\n\r\nthat  the  onerous requirements of prospectus filing  may  be\r\n\r\ndispensed with for small capital raising exercise.   In  such\r\n\r\ncases,  because the exposure to the public is rather  limited\r\n\r\nin  scope, a full compliance with the prospectus requirements\r\n\r\nof  the  Act may not be necessary or required.  In Australia,\r\n\r\nfor   instance,  under  the  Corporations  Law,  small  scale\r\n\r\nofferings  are  permitted  without  the  requirement   of   a\r\n\r\nprospectus, if a person makes `personal offers' of securities\r\n\r\nto  no  more  than 20 or fewer persons with no more  than  $2\r\n\r\nmillion being raised in any rolling 12-month\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperiod.    The   Australians  have  presumably  applied   the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  caveat  emptor.  One would  suppose  that  the\r\n\r\nlimited nature of the offering in numerical terms would  help\r\n\r\nto  moderate  the risk of massive fraud in the absence  of  a\r\n\r\nregistered prospectus.  In Singapore, for the reason that  we\r\n\r\nhave applied the principle of caveat emptor in most areas  of\r\n\r\ninvestments,  we should perhaps in a consistent manner  adopt\r\n\r\nthe  example  of the Australians and similarly dispense  with\r\n\r\nprospectus requirements for small scale offerings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having set out my comments on the broader picture, I now\r\n\r\nturn my attention to some of the drafting details in the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill sets out the new section 45 of the\r\n\r\nAct.   Section  45 prescribes the contents which prospectuses\r\n\r\nmust  have.  These would include, inter alia, all information\r\n\r\nthat  investors  and professional advisers should  reasonably\r\n\r\nrequire  to make an informed assessment.  Incidentally,  such\r\n\r\nprospectuses should contain information only to the extent to\r\n\r\nwhich  it  is reasonable for investors and their professional\r\n\r\nadvisers to expect to find in a prospectus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to require prospectuses to contain all information\r\n\r\nthat   investors   and  their  professional  advisers   would\r\n\r\nreasonably  require  is  to  place  unnecessary  and  overtly\r\n\r\nonerous  burden on the people concerned.  While every  effort\r\n\r\nwould  be made by the directors and professional advisers  to\r\n\r\nprovide  all information, whether or not all information  has\r\n\r\nbeen  provided  is  always determined  with  the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nhindsight.   Until then, one can never be certain whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  all  information  has  been  provided,  and  until  such\r\n\r\ninformation is challenged, the parties concerned would always\r\n\r\nbe  unsure  as  to whether or not they have discharged  their\r\n\r\nduties in this regard.  I note that under subsection (2), the\r\n\r\ninformation required should relate to what is reasonable  for\r\n\r\nthe  investors and their professional advisers to find in the\r\n\r\nprospectus and such information extends only to what is known\r\n\r\nand  in  the  circumstances ought  reasonably  to  have  been\r\n\r\nobtained by making enquiries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNonetheless,  the  burden still remains and  the  element  of\r\n\r\nuncertainty will always be there.  I would therefore urge the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider moderating the language of section 45 in\r\n\r\norder  to  reduce the extent of the burden placed  on  people\r\n\r\nproviding such information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsections 3(b) and (d) of section 45 appear to be\r\n\r\nrepetitive at first brush.  On closer examination, it appears\r\n\r\nthat  information is to be provided on the corporation  whose\r\n\r\nshares are the subject matter of the offer whether or not  it\r\n\r\nis  the corporation that is offering the shares or the person\r\n\r\nhaving  a  controlling  interest in the  corporation  who  is\r\n\r\noffering the shares.  If that were the case, subsections  (b)\r\n\r\nand   (d)   should  have  been  drafted  as  one  subsection.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in the way it is drafted, subsection (d)  gives\r\n\r\nrise  to uncertainties as there is no definition of what  the\r\n\r\nword  \"control\" means and the words \"underlie  the  offer  or\r\n\r\ninvitation\"  could  have simply been  substituted  with  \"the\r\n\r\ncorporation whose shares are being offered\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 amends section 38 of the Act by replacing it\r\n\r\nwith  a new provision.  On a plain reading of the new section\r\n\r\n48(1) and (2), it seems that subsection (1) is repetitive and\r\n\r\ncould  have  been  done  away  with  altogether.   Sir,  both\r\n\r\nsubsections  deal with the prohibition against advertisements\r\n\r\nunless  the provisions of the Act are complied with.  I  fail\r\n\r\nto  see, Sir, why subsection (1) should be there in the first\r\n\r\nplace.  Perhaps the Minister could explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under subsection (4) of section 48, it is a further\r\n\r\nrequirement that an advertisement of an offer or an intention\r\n\r\nto  offer shares must contain certain additional information.\r\n\r\nThese   would   include,  for  instance,  a  statement   that\r\n\r\nidentifies the offeror and the shares or debentures or  units\r\n\r\nof  shares  or  debentures.   Unfortunately,  Sir,  what  the\r\n\r\nsection does not indicate is how the information required  by\r\n\r\nthe  section  is  to be passed on to members of  the  public.\r\n\r\nVery  often, Sir, either in the print media or on television,\r\n\r\nthe  obligatory reference to these statements is carried  out\r\n\r\neither in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfine  print or in quick flashes across the screen, such  that\r\n\r\nit  made  a  mockery  of the mandatory requirement  that  the\r\n\r\ninformation be set out clearly in the advertisement.  This is\r\n\r\nclearly  an  instance where the people concerned  would  just\r\n\r\nnotionally  comply with the requirements of the Act  but  are\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily in keeping with its spirit by ensuring  that\r\n\r\nthe  information  required under subsection  (4)  is  clearly\r\n\r\npassed on to the readers or the audience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (8) of section 48 provides that an\r\n\r\nadvertisement   or  publication  does  not   contravene   the\r\n\r\nprohibition  in  the section, amongst other  things,  if  the\r\n\r\ndocument is a notice or report by the corporation or  one  of\r\n\r\nits  offices about its affairs to the Exchange or is a report\r\n\r\nby  the  corporation  or  one of its  offices  of  a  general\r\n\r\nmeeting.   There are several other exceptions in the section.\r\n\r\nIt  would  appear  that  this section  presupposes  documents\r\n\r\ncalling  attention to an offer to be advertisements.  Against\r\n\r\nthis  white canvass, rather detailed exceptions are set  out.\r\n\r\nSir, in law, we have the principle that express inclusion  is\r\n\r\nimplied exclusion.  While the proposed amendment seeks to set\r\n\r\nout  a comprehensive list of documents that would be exempted\r\n\r\nfrom  the  advertising  restriction,  it  nonetheless  raises\r\n\r\nqueries  in respect of other documents that are not  referred\r\n\r\nto  therein and that may therefore potentially qualify as  an\r\n\r\nadvertisement  for  the purposes of the Act.   For  instance,\r\n\r\nsection  210  schemes may inadvertently  be  caught  by  this\r\n\r\ndefinition  because there are potentially schemes that,  when\r\n\r\nimplemented, would draw the public's attention to an offer of\r\n\r\nshares  or  intended  offer of shares.   Additionally,  there\r\n\r\ncould  also  be  certain directors' reports  which,  on  some\r\n\r\noccasions,  may  be publicly published that are  not  covered\r\n\r\nunder the exceptions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than clearing any confusion, specific exemptions\r\n\r\non  some  advertisements give rise to the greater concern  of\r\n\r\nwhether other documents not referred to in the subsection are\r\n\r\nnecessarily  advertisements  simply  because  they  are   not\r\n\r\nspecifically  mentioned in the subsection.  After  all,  Sir,\r\n\r\nexpress inclusion is implied exclusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill revises section 55 of the Act,\r\n\r\nSir.   Section 55, Sir, as you are aware, sets out the  civil\r\n\r\nliability  for false and misleading statements and omissions.\r\n\r\nUnder  subsection (1), the Act provides that persons referred\r\n\r\nto in subsection (3) shall be liable to compensate any person\r\n\r\nwho suffers loss or damage as a result of false or misleading\r\n\r\nstatements in or omissions from the prospectus or the profile\r\n\r\nstatement,  even  if  such persons are not  involved  in  the\r\n\r\nmaking  of  false  or misleading statement or  the  omission.\r\n\r\nSubsection  (3)  sets  out a list of  such  persons  and,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  includes a person named in the  prospectus  with\r\n\r\nhis  consent  as  having  made the  statement.   That  person\r\n\r\ntypically  would  refer  to  the  professional  such  as  the\r\n\r\naccountants, the valuers and the solicitors.  Subsection 3(e)\r\n\r\nalso  provides that the person named in the prospectus  shall\r\n\r\nbe  liable  in respect of the inclusion of that statement  in\r\n\r\nthe document.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subsection (e) when read with subsection (1) is not\r\n\r\nclear.  While it is understandable that a valuer who puts his\r\n\r\nreport  in  the prospectus would be liable for the  valuation\r\n\r\nand  nothing  else,  one would like  to  know  the  scope  of\r\n\r\nliability  for,  say, the solicitor in the  prospectus  whose\r\n\r\nname has been included in the prospectus with his consent but\r\n\r\nwhose  involvement  in the drafting of the  prospectus  would\r\n\r\nmake  it  difficult  for  him  to  be  attributable  to   any\r\n\r\nparticular   statement.   Indeed,  one   would   have   great\r\n\r\ndifficulty   locating  any  specific   statement   as   being\r\n\r\nattributable  specifically to the solicitor  or  the  auditor\r\n\r\nsince they typically provide broad and general advice on  the\r\n\r\ndrafting of the prospectus.  Indeed, in some cases, it is the\r\n\r\nsolicitors  who  are  responsible for  the  drafting  of  the\r\n\r\nprospectus.  Does it mean therefore, Sir, that the  solicitor\r\n\r\nor  the auditor is responsible for the entire content in  the\r\n\r\nprospectus or the profile statement since subsection (1) says\r\n\r\nthe  person  shall  be  liable even if such  person  was  not\r\n\r\ninvolved  in the making of the false or misleading  statement\r\n\r\nor  the  omission?  If it were so, the burden would  be  very\r\n\r\nheavy on the professional advisors indeed.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nflipside,  on  the other hand, is that professional  advisors\r\n\r\nwould  take  extreme  caution  in  the  preparation  of   the\r\n\r\nprospectus  and the profile statement.  This would invariably\r\n\r\nadd to the cost of documentation.  I am not sure whether such\r\n\r\nan outcome would necessarily serve the interest of Singapore.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, the Minister could clarify the ambiguity here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 amends section 76(B) of the Act by widening\r\n\r\nthe   scope  of  share  buy-back  to  include,  inter   alia,\r\n\r\npreference  shares as well.  In our earlier debate  when  the\r\n\r\nAct  was  amended to accommodate share buy-back, I understand\r\n\r\nthat  the 10% threshold was a ceiling arbitrarily set because\r\n\r\nof  the  relative uncertainty as to how share  buy-backs  are\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  implemented  in Singapore.   Looking  at  the\r\n\r\noverall scheme of things, one wonders why there needs  to  be\r\n\r\nany  ceiling  on  share buy-backs at all.   Ultimately,  what\r\n\r\nmatters most is that the company must be solvent at the  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the  share buy-backs exercise is carried out.   If  the\r\n\r\ncompany  wishes to run its capital down by a margin  of  more\r\n\r\nthan 10%, I cannot see why we should put any restrictions  on\r\n\r\nthe  company to undertake such an exercise if the company  is\r\n\r\nsolvent.   I  would therefore like to urge  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider,  for future exercises, whether or not to  lift  the\r\n\r\n10% restriction in respect of share buy-backs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the amendments to protect the interests of investors.\r\n\r\nI  agree  with  the  need for greater disclosure  and  better\r\n\r\ngovernance.  However, I am a bit disappointed there  was  not\r\n\r\nthe same level of zeal to protect the interests of employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review the Minister spoke about has apparently not\r\n\r\ncovered this aspect.  Employees are important.  They make  or\r\n\r\nbreak   the   enterprise.   And  if  the  enterprise   fails,\r\n\r\nshareholders  will only lose the money they invested  in  the\r\n\r\nenterprise.   Employees, on the other  hand,  stand  to  lose\r\n\r\ntheir  livelihood if the enterprise fails.  Through salaries,\r\n\r\nemployees maintain their families, their standard of  living,\r\n\r\nsend  their children to school, service their homes,  housing\r\n\r\nloans and a whole lot of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings.   The  price of losing one's livelihood  compared  to\r\n\r\nlosing money in an investment is very much more painful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 328 of the Act gives greater retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits,  workman's  compensation, CPF contributions,  leave\r\n\r\npay, preference in the event of a liqudiation.  This is right\r\n\r\nand  it is good.  However, the maximum of five months' salary\r\n\r\nor  $7,500, whichever is lower, was fixed in an amendment  in\r\n\r\n1993.  It was seven years ago.  The average wage in 1993  was\r\n\r\n$1,918.   In  1999,  the average monthly wage  has  risen  to\r\n\r\n$2,813.  This reflects an increase of nearly $900 or 47%.   I\r\n\r\nsubmit that it is actually time to adjust this figure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect I would like to see is an amendment\r\n\r\nregarding judicial management.  It is silent over monies owed\r\n\r\nto  workers.   Under  judicial management,  workers  are  not\r\n\r\npreferential  creditors.  Workers tend to  lose  if  judicial\r\n\r\nmanagement  fails.   This appears to be a contradiction  with\r\n\r\nsection  328  of the Act.  I therefore urge the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider these aspects and make amendments to better  protect\r\n\r\nthe interests of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the\r\n\r\nBill.  However, I would like to make a couple of comments  on\r\n\r\nclauses affecting the financial statements.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nexpress relief that foreign subsidiaries will, in future,  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  adopt a financial end which is up to two  months\r\n\r\nearlier than that of the parent company.  In addition,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  avenue for a specified or class  of  companies\r\n\r\nwithin   the  group,  whether  incorporated  in  or  out   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  to  be  exempted  from  compliance  with  section\r\n\r\n201(a)(6).   For a long time now, groups have been  agonising\r\n\r\nover the provision of section 200 which requires a subsidiary\r\n\r\nto  have  a  year end which is coterminous with that  of  the\r\n\r\nparent  company  and section 201(a) which requires  that  the\r\n\r\naudited  accounts  of all the subsidiaries must  be  received\r\n\r\nbefore the audited consolidated account of the parent can  be\r\n\r\nissued.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not uncommon for groups to comprise 50 or more\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Making it compulsory for all the companies in the\r\n\r\ngroup  to have a coterminous year end stretches the resources\r\n\r\nof  the  accounting department.  If some of the  subsidiaries\r\n\r\nare  established  in  countries  where  there  is  a  limited\r\n\r\naccounting resource and where the accounting needs are vastly\r\n\r\ndifferent  from the standards set in Singapore, it becomes  a\r\n\r\nnightmare.  The proposed changes are therefore welcomed as it\r\n\r\nprovides vital relief to a problem faced by a growing  number\r\n\r\nof  companies as they regionalise.  The requirement  proposed\r\n\r\nby  the  Bill  is  to gazette exemption from compliance  with\r\n\r\nsection  201(a)(6).  As few members of the public would  have\r\n\r\naccess  to the gazette, I suggest that the directors'  report\r\n\r\nshould disclose this fact on the face of it together with the\r\n\r\ngrounds  for the exemption.  This will alert the  readers  of\r\n\r\nthe  accounts  that such exemption has been granted  and  the\r\n\r\nreasons  behind it so that they can form their own  judgement\r\n\r\nand react to the exclusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also a relief that public listed companies have to\r\n\r\nhold  their AGM within five months of the financial year end.\r\n\r\nIt has been rumoured that the change would be to require such\r\n\r\nAGM  to  be  held  within four months in  the  light  of  the\r\n\r\nforthcoming application of certain new or revised  accounting\r\n\r\nstandards  which  expands the disclosure  regime.   In  time,\r\n\r\npublic listed companies would be eager to hold their AGM even\r\n\r\nearlier  to  demonstrate their efficiency and good  corporate\r\n\r\ngovernance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me thank\r\n\r\nMembers for their comments and various suggestions.   Let  me\r\n\r\nfirst explain the context by which this Amendment Bill is put\r\n\r\nup.   As  Members are aware, we have three committees led  by\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector to look at the whole  range  of  issues.\r\n\r\nThere  is the Committee on Company Legislation and Regulatory\r\n\r\nFramework  which will review the Companies Act.   The  second\r\n\r\ncommittee is on Disclosure and Accounting Standards\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  Mr  Gerard  Ee  referred to.  And  there  is  a  third\r\n\r\nCommittee   on  Corporate  Governance  on  what   constitutes\r\n\r\ncorporate  governance and how we should bring  our  standards\r\n\r\ncloser to the best practices in the world.  While these three\r\n\r\ncommittees  are  doing  and reviewing  their  work  and  they\r\n\r\nproject  that  they  will  be able to  come  out  with  their\r\n\r\nrecommendations some time next year, we felt it necessary  to\r\n\r\nmake  these  amendments to the Companies  Act  following  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Corporate Finance Committee.  So  this\r\n\r\nAmendment Bill is very much a work in progress while many  of\r\n\r\nthe  other  issues  which  Members  raised  are  still  being\r\n\r\nresolved by the three committees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to assure Members who raised these\r\n\r\nsuggestions that these issues are indeed taken care of by the\r\n\r\nthree committees, as I am sure you are all aware, and in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  their deliberations, they will take the  Members'\r\n\r\nviews  into consideration.  So I would like to thank  Members\r\n\r\nfor  their comments.  But for the purpose of putting in place\r\n\r\nsome  of  the recommendations put up by the Corporate Finance\r\n\r\nCommittee,  we felt it necessary to introduce this  first  so\r\n\r\nthat  it  does not impede the workings in the companies.   We\r\n\r\nall  know that the business world is very varied and a single\r\n\r\nAct like the Companies Act will have to cover a wide range of\r\n\r\ncircumstances  and therefore this requires  quite  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ndeliberations and work.  So I hope Members will bear with  us\r\n\r\nwhile we let these three committees do their work and we will\r\n\r\ncome  back  to  the  House  some time  next  year  with  more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive amendments to the Companies Act after  we  have\r\n\r\ndone a review of the accounting and disclosure standards  and\r\n\r\nafter   we   have  gone  through  the  corporate   governance\r\n\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>OATHS AND DECLARATIONS BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current law on oaths and declarations can be\r\n\r\nfound  in three Acts: the Oaths Act, the Oaths of Office  and\r\n\r\nAllegiance  Act,  and  the Statutory Declarations  Act.   All\r\n\r\nthree  Acts  were enacted in the late 1800s.   Last  year,  a\r\n\r\nCommittee  established by the Attorney-General  reviewed  the\r\n\r\nlaw  on  oaths and declarations and recommended that  it  was\r\n\r\ntimely  to  amend  and consolidate the three  Acts  into  one\r\n\r\ncomprehensive Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oaths and Declarations Bill gives effect to the\r\n\r\nCommittee's  recommendations and will repeal and  consolidate\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the three Acts into one Act.  In  drafting\r\n\r\nthe  Bill,  we  have also taken the opportunity to  eliminate\r\n\r\nobsolete   provisions  from  the  three  existing  Acts   and\r\n\r\nmodernise the language used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also sever links with the UK Statutory\r\n\r\nDeclarations  Act  of  1835  brought  in  by  virtue  of  the\r\n\r\nStatutory  Declarations  Act which  simply  states  that  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom's  Statutory  Declarations  Act  is  part  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  law.   The Bill will enable us  to  have  our  own\r\n\r\nlegislation on statutory declarations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now highlight some salient features of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Part II (Oaths)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of four provisions, Part II of the\r\n\r\nBill  re-enacts the provisions of the existing Oaths  Act  in\r\n\r\nmodern language and drafting style.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two provisions concern the power of courts to\r\n\r\nallow  oaths and affirmations in customary forms  other  than\r\n\r\nthose  provided  in  the Act.  These provisions  are  largely\r\n\r\nhistorical and were intended to cater to our largely  migrant\r\n\r\nsociety in the past, where different\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommunities carried with them different customs on how  oaths\r\n\r\nwere to be made.  They are no longer relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third provision which has not been re-enacted\r\n\r\nconcerns  the  summary power of the High Court and  Court  of\r\n\r\nAppeal  to  summarily  punish a  witness  who  has  committed\r\n\r\nperjury before it for contempt of court without the need  for\r\n\r\na  separate trial.  This provision is unnecessary as specific\r\n\r\npowers  of  punishment for contempt in the face of the  court\r\n\r\nare  already found in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and\r\n\r\nthe Subordinate Courts Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fourth provision which has not been re-enacted\r\n\r\nis  the  one which says that the Oaths Act does not apply  to\r\n\r\nproceedings  before courts martial.  There is no  reason  why\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the Oaths Act re-enacted in Part II of the\r\n\r\nBill,  except for clause 7 which deals with form of oath  and\r\n\r\naffirmation, should not apply to courts martial.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Part III (Statutory Declarations)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provisions of Part III of the Bill on statutory\r\n\r\ndeclarations  are  drawn mainly from similar  laws  found  in\r\n\r\nAustralia,   New  Zealand  and  Hong  Kong.   The  provisions\r\n\r\nprescribe the form and manner in which statutory declarations\r\n\r\nmay be made in Singapore, and the manner in which they may be\r\n\r\nmade outside Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The making, use or attempted use, of a false statutory\r\n\r\ndeclaration  is  an offence under clause 14, punishable  with\r\n\r\nimprisonment of up to three years and a fine.

To create a more conducive  environment  for\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial development, one of the measures was to allow\r\n\r\na Singapore residential property used for business activities\r\n\r\nto  also  qualify for estate duty exemption.  This is allowed\r\n\r\nso  long as the residential character of the property is  not\r\n\r\nmaterially affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change will support the Technopreneur Home Office\r\n\r\nScheme introduced last year.  It will also allow small\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusinesses to be carried out from a residential home  without\r\n\r\nthe  property  being automatically disqualified  from  estate\r\n\r\nduty  exemption.   Accordingly,  the  proposed  amendment  to\r\n\r\nsection  14(5A) seeks to include residential properties  used\r\n\r\nfor businesses under the $9 million exemption for residential\r\n\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment in section 14(6) is a change in the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  \"dwelling house\" as used in the  Estate  Duty\r\n\r\nAct.   This  amendment will explicitly exclude  quarters  and\r\n\r\nhostels  from dwelling houses.  This will make it clear  that\r\n\r\nresidential properties used as hostels and quarters will  not\r\n\r\nqualify for the $9 million exemption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two amendments in this Bill seek to improve\r\n\r\nthe estate duty procedures administered by IRAS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the estate duty affidavit will be replaced by an\r\n\r\nestate duty return.  At present, affidavits are required  for\r\n\r\nestate  duty  submissions, one for non-dutiable  estates  and\r\n\r\nanother  for  dutiable estates.  These  are  sworn  documents\r\n\r\nwhich  require the endorsement of a Commissioner of Oaths  or\r\n\r\nthe Commissioner of Estate Duty.  The estate duty return will\r\n\r\ndo away with the need for the oath.  There will be a standard\r\n\r\nform for dutiable estates, and another standard form for non-dutiable  estates.  The return for non-dutiable estates  will\r\n\r\nbe much simplified compared to the current affidavit: it will\r\n\r\nask  for  fewer details.  The return continues to be a  legal\r\n\r\ndocument  admissible as evidence in court.  The administrator\r\n\r\nhas  to  make  sure  that the return  is  free  of  error  or\r\n\r\nmisrepresentation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second proposal allows the Commissioner of Estate\r\n\r\nDuty to delegate his authority to his senior officers to sign\r\n\r\nthe   certificates,  schedules  of  assets  and  Notices   of\r\n\r\nAssessment  under  the Estate Duty Act.   The  delegation  of\r\n\r\nauthority  will  improve overall efficiency  and  allow  IRAS\r\n\r\ngreater flexibility in case processing.  The quality  of  the\r\n\r\nassessment will not be compromised as the authority  will  be\r\n\r\ndelegated  only to experienced senior officers in supervisory\r\n\r\npositions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I rise to support the Bill. I think that\r\n\r\nit  is  very tidy to relook at the laws and bring  them  into\r\n\r\nconsistency with other new initiatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that spirit, may I raise another anomaly in the\r\n\r\nEstate Duty Act for the Ministry to consider.  Sir, in making\r\n\r\nthese comments, I appreciate that the general trend in estate\r\n\r\nduty  has  been  to make it less onerous in  order  to  allow\r\n\r\npeople  who  have worked hard in their lifetime  to  pass  on\r\n\r\nproperty to their loved ones after their death.  And this  is\r\n\r\nespecially for dwelling houses, an exemption of $9 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the present law, if a person owns a house\r\n\r\nsolely and this person dies, there is no estate duty so  long\r\n\r\nas  his  house is a dwelling house and it is valued  at  less\r\n\r\nthan  $9 million.  The anomaly I would point to, however,  is\r\n\r\nthat  it  differs if he has purchased the house in the  joint\r\n\r\nnames of himself and his spouse - his wife or her husband.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Sir, under the standing provision of\r\n\r\nsection  8(1)(b), if a man buys a house with his own purchase\r\n\r\nmoney  and  puts it in the name of himself and his  wife  and\r\n\r\nthen, if he should unfortunately die within five years, this,\r\n\r\nI  understand,  is  treated as a gift and  would  be  subject\r\n\r\ntherefore  to estate duty tax.  This seems to  me  to  be  an\r\n\r\nanomaly, because, as I said, if he had purchased it and  kept\r\n\r\nit  solely  in his name, there would be no tax accruing.   It\r\n\r\nalso  seems to me to be a potentially unfair decision on  the\r\n\r\nsurviving  spouse since there will be more tax  payable  and,\r\n\r\nperhaps, at a late stage in life, there may not be that  much\r\n\r\ncash to meet the tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry might consider this anomaly\r\n\r\nand,  if  it is found justifiable, to remedy it in a  further\r\n\r\nprovision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> My Ministry will look again into\r\n\r\nthis  particular clause, but I want to point out that if  the\r\n\r\ntransaction is made within the 5-year period, then of  course\r\n\r\nthe issue does not arise.

Hence,  all\r\n\r\npartners  in  an  accounting firm can be  sued  if  a  single\r\n\r\npartner is errant.  This may have been all right in the  past\r\n\r\nwhen  accounting  firms were expected to  be  small  set-ups.\r\n\r\nHowever, in today's globalised environment, this is no longer\r\n\r\nrealistic.   The Bill will allow for accounting corporations,\r\n\r\nin  addition to existing business structures.  The Government\r\n\r\nis  not  advocating  that accountants  adopt  any  particular\r\n\r\nbusiness structure or model.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main features of accounting corporations are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it allows for a better framework for professional\r\n\r\naccountability,   where  the  innocent   public   accountants\r\n\r\npractising in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan accounting corporation will not be jointly liable with the\r\n\r\nerrant  ones.   The errant public accountant  will  still  be\r\n\r\nliable under the law of tort, without a statutory cap on  his\r\n\r\nliability.    This  is  to  ensure  that  public  accountants\r\n\r\nmaintain high standards of professional duty and care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, corporatisation allows accounting practices to\r\n\r\nraise   external  capital.   Access  to  external   financing\r\n\r\nincreases  the competitiveness and global reach of accounting\r\n\r\ncorporations, and is in line with the Government's drive  for\r\n\r\nregionalisation and globalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it allows non-public accountants to be directors\r\n\r\nand  shareholders  in an accounting corporation,  subject  to\r\n\r\nregulatory  safeguards.  In an accounting  partnership,  only\r\n\r\npublic accountants can be partners.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Regulation of accounting corporations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounting corporations will be incorporated under the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act and will be subject to the Companies Act.   The\r\n\r\ncorporation  must also be approved by the Public  Accountants\r\n\r\nBoard.    Some   of  the  key  safeguards  to  maintain   the\r\n\r\nindependence   and   professional   standards    of    public\r\n\r\naccountants,  who  are  key  players  in  ensuring  effective\r\n\r\ncompliance with disclosure requirements and the integrity  of\r\n\r\nour corporate environment, include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the primary object of the accounting corporation\r\n\r\nmust  be  to  provide  public  accountancy  services.   These\r\n\r\nservices  include audit and reporting on financial statements\r\n\r\nand  other  acts that are required to be done by an  approved\r\n\r\ncompany  auditor under the Companies Act or under  any  other\r\n\r\nwritten  law.  They do not include services such as  taxation\r\n\r\nand consultancy services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, accounting corporations must have a minimum\r\n\r\nauthorised   share  capital  of  $50,000.   To  ensure   that\r\n\r\nownership  and control of accounting corporations  remain  in\r\n\r\nthe  hands of public accountants, at least two-thirds of  the\r\n\r\nvoting shares of an accounting corporation must be owned by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorporate practitioners.  A corporate practitioner refers  to\r\n\r\na  director or an employee of the corporation who is a public\r\n\r\naccountant and is practising as such in that corporation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to ensure the independence of the accounting\r\n\r\ncorporation,  all  shareholders  must  be  natural   persons.\r\n\r\nShareholding by nominees and securitization of any  share  in\r\n\r\nan  accounting corporation are prohibited.  This  is  because\r\n\r\naccounting corporations will be auditing other companies, and\r\n\r\nwe need to ensure that these audits are independent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, to ensure that parties contracting with an\r\n\r\naccounting corporation are adequately protected in the  event\r\n\r\nof  a  breach  of contract or negligence on the part  of  the\r\n\r\naccounting   corporation,  it  is  mandatory  for  accounting\r\n\r\ncorporations  to  take  up professional indemnity  insurance.\r\n\r\nThe minimum amounts are as stated in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing for the incorporation of accountants will\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  creation of a more vibrant  and  competitive\r\n\r\naccounting services sector in Singapore, to better  meet  the\r\n\r\nchallenges of the global economy in this new millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to the\r\n\r\nPublic Accountants Board's Sub-Committee, chaired by the then\r\n\r\nAccountant-General, Mr Goh Khee Kuan, and  members  from  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nNanyang Technological University, the Singapore Exchange, the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's  Chambers, and the Registry  of  Companies\r\n\r\nand  Businesses,  for working on the issues  which  form  the\r\n\r\ncontent  of  this Amendment Bill.  Inputs were also  obtained\r\n\r\nfrom the Association of Banks in the drafting of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I wish to speak in support of\r\n\r\nthe Accountants (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am in total agreement with the proposal that\r\n\r\naccounting  firms should be allowed to form Public Accounting\r\n\r\nCorporations  (PACs).   Essentially, this  means  that  local\r\n\r\naccounting firms will be allowed to corporatise. The  benefit\r\n\r\nis  that  after corporatisation, local firms can look towards\r\n\r\nmergers  to  form  bigger  companies  or  to  form  strategic\r\n\r\nalliances  with  overseas  firms. Corporatisation  will  also\r\n\r\nenable local firms to adopt more professional practices which\r\n\r\nwill  facilitate recruiting and retaining of good  staff.  It\r\n\r\nalso  removes  the  onerous responsibility of  unlimited  and\r\n\r\ncollective responsibility as in the case of partnerships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to take this opportunity to raise a point\r\n\r\nnot  covered  in  this  Bill and that is  on  advertising  by\r\n\r\nprofessional  firms.  I note that current rules which  govern\r\n\r\nthe  conduct  of professional firms such as accounting  firms\r\n\r\nare  that  they  are  not allowed to openly  advertise  their\r\n\r\nservices.   I would like to suggest that this restriction  be\r\n\r\nreviewed.   Professional firms should be allowed to  do  some\r\n\r\nlimited  form  of  responsible  advertising.   I  feel   that\r\n\r\npermitting  advertisement will be beneficial, especially  for\r\n\r\nthe  smaller local firms.  Large accounting firms, especially\r\n\r\nthe  foreign  ones, are already very well-known  and  do  not\r\n\r\nrequire   advertising  to  publicise   their   services   and\r\n\r\nexpertise.   Moreover, large foreign firms  get  ample  press\r\n\r\ncoverage of their activities or coverage of events which they\r\n\r\ncan afford to sponsor.  On the contrary, small firms have  no\r\n\r\nmeans  of  publicising their expertise and  services.  Hence,\r\n\r\nthere  is a need to review and relax on the advertising rules\r\n\r\nso  that  small firms can advertise and let their prospective\r\n\r\nclients know more about the services that they can offer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to point out that the Government should\r\n\r\nconsider similar relaxation of rules on advertising for other\r\n\r\nprofessional firms such as the lawyers, architects, engineers\r\n\r\nand  others,  and  also  allowing them to  corporatise  their\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I stand to support the Accountants\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill.

I  was  also  a member  of  the  sub-committee\r\n\r\nestablished by the Public\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccountants   Board  to  study  the  incorporation   of   the\r\n\r\naccounting profession which led to the introduction  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard this House engaged in a lively debate\r\n\r\nearlier this year to allow legal practitioners to set up  law\r\n\r\ncorporations,   members  of  the  accounting  profession   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  generally  expect that the option  to  incorporate\r\n\r\nwill  be  extended to accountants.  The introduction of  this\r\n\r\nBill   to  allow  public  accountants  to  establish   Public\r\n\r\nAccounting  Corporations  (PACs) has  therefore  been  widely\r\n\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Government's adoption of the\r\n\r\nprinciple  for  professionals in  Singapore  to  incorporate.\r\n\r\nRight  now, the engineering, architectural, medical and legal\r\n\r\nprofessions  can  opt  to  adopt the incorporation  route  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  passing  of this Bill  will  enable  public\r\n\r\naccountants to similarly elect to embrace a corporate model.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the Government for recognising the need to\r\n\r\ngrant the professions in Singapore the option to incorporate.\r\n\r\nIt   is  imperative  that  members  of  all  professions   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  including  public  accountants,  are  given   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to incorporate. After all, accounting  firms  in\r\n\r\njurisidictions,  such as the United States  of  America,  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Hong  Kong\r\n\r\ncan opt to incorporate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in Singapore, however, accounting firms\r\n\r\ncan only operate as sole proprietors or partnerships based on\r\n\r\nunlimited  joint and several liability.  If the firm's  asset\r\n\r\nis inadequate to meet a claim, the personal assets of all the\r\n\r\npartners in the firm are liable for the claim.  Given today's\r\n\r\nincredulously massive amount of claims, all it takes  is  for\r\n\r\njust  one  partner's  deficiency  to  annihilate  the  entire\r\n\r\nlifetime  earnings of the other partners in the  firm.   This\r\n\r\nunlimited  liability factor can act as  a  deterrent  to  the\r\n\r\ngrowth of the accounting firm and the profession as a whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a PAC, an accountant's liability will no longer be\r\n\r\nunlimited in respect of his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npartner's  shortcomings.  This, it must be  noted,  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that  the  clients of a PAC will not be protected.   In\r\n\r\nthis  regard, ample safeguards have been provided for in  the\r\n\r\nBill.   A  minimum capital of $50,000 is required to  form  a\r\n\r\nPAC.   A  PAC is also required to have an adequate  level  of\r\n\r\nprofessional  indemnity  insurance  cover,  ranging  from  $1\r\n\r\nmillion  to $50 million, depending on the number of corporate\r\n\r\npractitioners and the gross income of the PAC.  As  with  the\r\n\r\nlegal  profession,  limited liability  will  not  affect  the\r\n\r\nprofessional standards of accountants in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my other reason for supporting the Bill is because\r\n\r\nincorporation   will   allow  professionals   to   reposition\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  the  New  Economy  business  landscape.   The\r\n\r\ndigital  transformation has attached a high  premium  to  the\r\n\r\napplication   of  human  know-how.   In  our  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy,  intellectual asset has become critical  and  highly\r\n\r\nvalued.   Incorporation will lend a hand to accounting  firms\r\n\r\nseeking   to  counter  the  fierce  clamouring  for   limited\r\n\r\nknowledge  resources.  It will render it easier for  PACs  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  and  retain valued staff against the ardent  rivalry\r\n\r\nfor  talents  from other corporations and institutions,  both\r\n\r\nlocally  and  internationally.   By  offering  more  flexible\r\n\r\nremuneration packages, including employee stock options, PACs\r\n\r\nwill be better positioned to be the employer of choice in the\r\n\r\nmarketplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorporation will also facilitate PACs to raise more\r\n\r\ncapital to gain a wider reach for their services.  The leeway\r\n\r\nto  allow  one-third  of the PAC's shareholders  to  be  non-practitioners  will breed a more multi-disciplinary  business\r\n\r\norientation  within the PAC, greatly enhancing  its  capacity\r\n\r\nand  capability  to  provide clients  with  seamless  service\r\n\r\ndelivery,   whilst   still  maintaining   the   PAC's   audit\r\n\r\nindependence.    Hence,   incorporation   can   provide   our\r\n\r\nprofessionals with the critical structural support to elevate\r\n\r\nthem  to a platform to compete with the world's best.  But  I\r\n\r\nmust qualify that incorporation is not a panacea for business\r\n\r\nwoes.  It is not a pill prescribed to resurrect failing  sole\r\n\r\nproprietorships or partnerships.  Instead, this Bill is meant\r\n\r\nto enable the accounting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofession, as a whole, to move forward with the times,  keep\r\n\r\npace  with world-wide development in the profession and  meet\r\n\r\nthe  growing needs of the business community.  It will create\r\n\r\nan environment that is more conducive for the development and\r\n\r\nbetter  practice of the accounting profession  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  introduction of this Bill is therefore  appropriate.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like, however, to raise two points for the  Minister's\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my first point is on the capping of liability. We\r\n\r\nshould  make a clear distinction between the PACs  and  other\r\n\r\ncompanies  under  the  Companies Act.  This  is  because  the\r\n\r\nclaims  against  professionals in general and accountants  in\r\n\r\nparticular are grossly disproportionate to the fees that they\r\n\r\nearn.  Such claims are neither fair nor equitable.  They  are\r\n\r\nnot  fair,  as the claims made against accountants  are  many\r\n\r\nmanifold  times  the amount of fees charged.   They  are  not\r\n\r\nequitable,  as  the  claims  made against  the  auditors  are\r\n\r\nusually   more  excessive  than  that  pursued  against   the\r\n\r\nmanagement   at  fault.   Because,  unlike  the   PACs,   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  do  not  need  to take up mandatory  professional\r\n\r\nindemnity insurance cover under the Companies Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is absurd to expect an auditor, who clearly did\r\n\r\nnot  connive  to  bring  down a  company,  to  be  sued  more\r\n\r\nexcessively than the management directly responsible for  the\r\n\r\ncompany's  collapse.  There is no question that if at  fault,\r\n\r\nthe  auditor  must be personally liable.  But it  is  clearly\r\n\r\nunreasonable  to penalise the PAC and auditor  more  severely\r\n\r\nthan  the management for a failure that the auditor  did  not\r\n\r\ndirectly bring to bear upon the company.  If the accountant's\r\n\r\nexposure  to claims remains unlimited under the law of  tort,\r\n\r\nthere  is little incentive for a sole proprietor or  a  small\r\n\r\naccounting practice to convert to a PAC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned to the House in January this year,\r\n\r\nthe    tendency   for   escalating   claims   made    against\r\n\r\nprofessionals, including lawyers and accountants, is  due  to\r\n\r\nthe \"deep pocket\" syndrome.  Claimants\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  somehow erroneously led to believe that accountants  and\r\n\r\nother   professionals  can  afford  grossly  disproportionate\r\n\r\nclaims  due to their extensive insurance cover.  In  reality,\r\n\r\nthe  indemnity pockets of the professionals may not  be  deep\r\n\r\nenough.   This is because, on the one hand, the  capacity  of\r\n\r\nthe professional indemnity insurance market is shrinking.  On\r\n\r\nthe other hand, the quantum of claims has been escalating  to\r\n\r\nsuch  astonishing levels that it has become really impossible\r\n\r\nfor  individual  accountants or accounting firms  to  recover\r\n\r\nfrom  large claims.  Instead, a single successful  claim  can\r\n\r\neasily  and  completely  wipe out the life-time  earnings  of\r\n\r\nindividual  public accountants.  If there is a threshold  for\r\n\r\nreasonable  claims,  the current sky-high  amount  of  claims\r\n\r\nagainst  professionals has crossed the threshold  many  times\r\n\r\nover.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, professionals are caught in a vicious\r\n\r\nindemnity   cycle.   For  genuine  fear  of  the  impact   of\r\n\r\nescalating  claims, the professionals are usually  left  with\r\n\r\nlittle  option,  but  to take up a high  level  of  indemnity\r\n\r\ninsurance coverage that renders them more prone to law  suits\r\n\r\nand claims.  Sir, there should be a capping on the amount  of\r\n\r\nclaims  against professionals, so that the amount  of  claims\r\n\r\nbears a fairer resemblance to the fees charged.  For example,\r\n\r\nthe  claims could be capped based on a fixed multiple of  the\r\n\r\namount of fees charged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first proposed the capping of liability for\r\n\r\nprofessionals in the debate on law corporations earlier  this\r\n\r\nyear,  the  Minister of State was concerned that the  capping\r\n\r\nmay  lead  a  lawyer  to  lower his guard,  and  hence  lower\r\n\r\nprofessional standards.  This should not be a concern, as the\r\n\r\ncapping  can  be  at a reasonably high but  not  astronomical\r\n\r\nlevel.    In  any  case,  the  Bill  has  provided   adequate\r\n\r\nsafeguards  in  respect  of the  PAC.   A  PAC  must  provide\r\n\r\nadequate  insurance  cover  of between  $1  million  and  $50\r\n\r\nmillion,  depending  on the size of the practice.   Negligent\r\n\r\npractitioners  can  be  struck off  the  Register  of  Public\r\n\r\nAccountants  and lose their livelihood through the  practice.\r\n\r\nMore significantly, as an individual public accountant\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill be liable under the law of tort, whilst his partners are\r\n\r\nnot jointly liable in their personal capacity for claims,  we\r\n\r\ncan  expect individual accountants to be more circumspect  in\r\n\r\ntheir  statutory  roles.  Hence, I am of the  view  that  the\r\n\r\ncapping   of liability will not affect professional standards\r\n\r\nand  substance.   On  this  basis, can  the  Minister  please\r\n\r\nclarify whether a capping on the liability for professionals,\r\n\r\nparticularly   public  accountants  in  the  PAC,   will   be\r\n\r\nconsidered?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point concerns exempt private status. I\r\n\r\nwish   to   seek  clarification  on  whether  a  wholly-owned\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  of the PAC can be deemed to be an exempt  private\r\n\r\ncompany.  According to the Bill, PACs will be granted  exempt\r\n\r\nprivate  status.   A  PAC may decide  to  give  some  of  its\r\n\r\ndepartments  more autonomy to manage their own  finances  and\r\n\r\noperations.   The  PAC  directors  may  decide  that  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of growing the business, these departments should be\r\n\r\nrestructured as wholly owned subsidiaries of the PAC, so that\r\n\r\nthey  can  be more autonomous in operations.  Also, different\r\n\r\nHR policies and salary structures may give rise to a need for\r\n\r\na  line  of  business to be hived off under a separate  legal\r\n\r\nentity.   A PAC should be given the freedom to structure  its\r\n\r\nbusiness   in  this  way,  with  its  subsidiaries  similarly\r\n\r\nenjoying  exempt private status.  But this should be  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis that the subsidiaries must be wholly owned by the  PAC.\r\n\r\nSo long as the PAC is not disqualified and continues to be an\r\n\r\nexempt  private  company,  can the Minister  clarify  whether\r\n\r\nwholly  owned  subsidiaries  of  a  PAC  will  similarly   be\r\n\r\nconsidered exempt private companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these two points which I hope the Minister can\r\n\r\nconsider, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the\r\n\r\nBill.   Being the fifth speaker and speaking after  the  Vice\r\n\r\nPresident  of  the ICPAS, I find that much  of  what  I  have\r\n\r\nplanned  to say have been said.  So, I shall zoom in to  lend\r\n\r\nsupport to the two points that I share great concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is on the capping of liability. The objective of\r\n\r\nthe  public  accounting corporations  is  to  afford  limited\r\n\r\nliability to the members as opposed to a partnership.  As the\r\n\r\nMinister has said, under tort, the individual would not enjoy\r\n\r\nsuch protection and can be sued for unlimited amounts.  I can\r\n\r\nsee  that,  in  practice, no individual will  be  willing  to\r\n\r\naccept the responsibility for signing off accounts unless  he\r\n\r\nobtains  cross  indemnity from the rest of his  members.   If\r\n\r\nthat  happens,  it  would negate the benefit  that  a  public\r\n\r\naccounting operation serves to provide.  Therefore, I wonder,\r\n\r\nas  Mr Ong wonders, whether it is possible to legislate a cap\r\n\r\non the quantum of a claim from a piece of work to be based on\r\n\r\na multiple of the fees charged for that piece of work.   This\r\n\r\nwill  certainly achieve a more equitable relationship between\r\n\r\npractitioner and client.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mr Leong, I would like to make reference also to a\r\n\r\nrelaxation of advertising rules.  The Bill hints  on  such  a\r\n\r\npossible   relaxation.   New  section  48(2A)(b)  refers   to\r\n\r\nadvertising or holding itself out or describing itself in any\r\n\r\nway  to  be an accounting corporation or to be authorised  to\r\n\r\nprovide public accountancy services in Singapore.  Currently,\r\n\r\nthe  rules on advertising prohibit a public accountant or his\r\n\r\nfirm  from seeking professional work by means of advertising.\r\n\r\nAnd  \"advertising\"  is  defined as \"a  communication  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  of information as to the services or skills  provided\r\n\r\nby  a public accountant or firm of public accountants with  a\r\n\r\nview  to procuring professional business.\"  I am hoping  that\r\n\r\nin  the  spirit  of  new  section  48(2A)(b),  the  rules  of\r\n\r\nadvertising  will be amended.  With a liberalisation  of  the\r\n\r\nadvertising rules, I expect to see more articles  on  various\r\n\r\nbusiness  aspects  to be made available  which  will  provide\r\n\r\nnuggets of information of value to the public.  As it stands,\r\n\r\nwhilst  in  the rest of the developed world one could  easily\r\n\r\naccess interesting websites produced by accounting firms,  we\r\n\r\nin  the  accounting profession here in Singapore  agonise  in\r\n\r\nhaving  to tell people to log-on to our US or other  overseas\r\n\r\nwebsites to learn more about doing business in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I answer\r\n\r\nMembers'  questions, I would like to thank all  of  them  for\r\n\r\nsupporting the Bill itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now take their questions in the order in which\r\n\r\nthey  were raised.  Mr Leong Horn Kee and later Mr Gerard  Ee\r\n\r\nhave   suggested  that  accountants  should  be  allowed   to\r\n\r\nadvertise  their services in a controlled way, in particular,\r\n\r\nthe  smaller firms which are not well known and therefore are\r\n\r\nunable  to  compete with the larger firms.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint out that the rules governing advertising by accountants\r\n\r\nare   determined   by  the  Institute  of  Certified   Public\r\n\r\nAccountants of Singapore (ICPAS).  I understand that ICPAS is\r\n\r\nreviewing the issue and I will refer the Members' suggestions\r\n\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Lily Neo for the questions that\r\n\r\nshe  raised  as  it gives me the opportunity to  clarify  the\r\n\r\nambiguities.  Dr Neo is concerned that the use  of  the  word\r\n\r\n\"prescribed\" in new section 18A(3)(b), (c)(i) and (c)(ii) may\r\n\r\ncreate  ambiguity.  The word means prescribed by the  Act  or\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  legislation made thereunder,  as  provided  under\r\n\r\nPart  I, section 2(i) of the Interpretation Act.  In the case\r\n\r\nof  the  Accountants Act, it is the rules made by the  Public\r\n\r\nAccountants  Board with the approval of the Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nunder section 58.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On new section 18A(3)(b), the comma after \"$50,000\" is\r\n\r\nnot a typographical error.  It is common practice to insert a\r\n\r\ncomma before the qualifying phrase \"or such other sum as  may\r\n\r\nbe prescribed.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo is also concerned that uncertainty could arise\r\n\r\nbecause section 18I(7) does not state the commencement period\r\n\r\nof  the grace period.  I do not believe that there should  be\r\n\r\nambiguity.   Section 18A makes it clear that  only  corporate\r\n\r\npractitioners can own two-thirds of the protected fraction or\r\n\r\nmore  of  the  voting shares.  If the protected  fraction  of\r\n\r\nshareholding  is not affected as a result of the  shareholder\r\n\r\nceasing  to be a public accountant or corporate practitioner,\r\n\r\nneither the accounting corporation nor the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperson will apply to PAB for a grace period.  They will apply\r\n\r\nonly if the protected shareholding fraction is affected.  The\r\n\r\ngrace  period they will ask for will be from the date of  the\r\n\r\nevent  of disqualification which took place.  Otherwise,  the\r\n\r\naccounting  corporation cannot be said to  be  in  compliance\r\n\r\nwith  section 18I at all times, thereby rendering it open  to\r\n\r\ndisciplinary action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also notes that section 18I is silent on the\r\n\r\nissue  of the non-transfer of voting shares.  The consequence\r\n\r\nof  non-transfer of voting shares is addressed in new section\r\n\r\n21A(1)(f).   In  the event of a non-transfer, the  accounting\r\n\r\ncorporation  will not be in compliance with section  18I  and\r\n\r\nits  status  as  an accounting corporation  can  be  revoked.\r\n\r\nAfter  revocation, the company can still provide professional\r\n\r\nservices  other  than  public  accountancy  services  in  its\r\n\r\ncapacity as a company registered under the Companies Act  and\r\n\r\naccording to its articles of association.  The company cannot\r\n\r\nthen  hold itself out as an accounting corporation and  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  operate  under  revocation under  a  revised  name,\r\n\r\nsubject  to  the approval of the Registrar of  Companies  and\r\n\r\nBusinesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo is also concerned that after the one-month period\r\n\r\nallowed for the filling of a vacant directorship, it might be\r\n\r\ninsufficient  in  the case of an accounting corporation  with\r\n\r\nonly   two   directors.   In  this  case  of  an   accounting\r\n\r\ncorporation with only two directors, only one of  them  needs\r\n\r\nto  be a public accountant.  If the vacancy created is for  a\r\n\r\ndirector who is not a public accountant, filling the  vacancy\r\n\r\nshould   not  be  a  problem  within  the  one-month   period\r\n\r\nstipulated.   If  the  vacancy  created  is  for   a   public\r\n\r\naccountant  and the accounting corporation has difficulty  in\r\n\r\nfilling it within the one-month deadline, it may apply to the\r\n\r\nPublic Accountants Board for an extension of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would point out that if an accounting\r\n\r\ncorporation  is  dissatisfied  with  the  Public  Accountants\r\n\r\nBoard's  decision on this issue, it can appeal  to  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt,  as provided under section 21A(1)(f) and under section\r\n\r\n22.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Noris Ong, and later Mr Gerard Ee, have both said\r\n\r\nthat  they  would  want  a cap on the  accountant's  personal\r\n\r\nliability,  otherwise there would be no incentives  for  sole\r\n\r\nproprietors to form accounting corporations.  I would like to\r\n\r\nsay  that,  as  far  as  the  Government  is  concerned,  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  this  Bill  is neither  to  encourage  nor  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage    accountants   from   setting   up    accounting\r\n\r\ncorporations.   It  is  to allow for an  additional  form  of\r\n\r\nbusiness   structure   for   accountants   over   and   above\r\n\r\npartnerships.    A  statutory  cap  on  auditors'   liability\r\n\r\nsuggests  that we can statutorily pre-determine the potential\r\n\r\ndamage caused by an errant auditor.  There are also two  main\r\n\r\ndisadvantages to statutory capping.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, setting such a cap on the auditors' liability may\r\n\r\nbe unfair to the plaintiff as he may suffer damages caused by\r\n\r\nthe  public  accountant in excess of the cap.   Second,  high\r\n\r\nstandards of public accounting are crucial to the development\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  as an international financial  and  investment\r\n\r\ncentre.   Statutory  capping  may indirectly  compromise  the\r\n\r\nstandards  as  the  incentives for public accountants  to  be\r\n\r\nthorough in their work may be lowered with the knowledge that\r\n\r\nthey  will  not  be hurt badly in the event of  a  law  suit.\r\n\r\nOther  professions  have  been  allowed  to  incorporate   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  namely,  the lawyers, engineers,  architects  and\r\n\r\ndoctors,  and  none of them have statutory capping  on  their\r\n\r\nliabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Ong has also suggested that the subsidiaries\r\n\r\nof  accounting corporations should also be treated as private\r\n\r\nexempt   companies.   I  believe  it  would  depend  on   the\r\n\r\nactivities of these subsidiaries.  In most instances, I would\r\n\r\nassume that the subsidiaries of auditing firms are formed  to\r\n\r\ndo  mostly  non-auditing work.  If this is the case  and  the\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries are performing non-auditing work, there would be\r\n\r\nlittle  ground  for  granting  them  private  exempt  status.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this  is  an area which I will undertake  to  study\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Just a clarification, Sir.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be\r\n\r\nnow read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Introduction</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Public Entertainments Act plays an important\r\n\r\nrole in maintaining law and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder  and  public  safety, as well  as  safeguarding  public\r\n\r\nmorality and decency.  The Act regulates the different  forms\r\n\r\nof  entertainment  to which the public has  access,  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  the  entertainment is not carried out, for example,  in\r\n\r\nplaces  not  suitable to its nature, or  with  little  or  no\r\n\r\nregard  for  public safety, or in a manner that is  indecent,\r\n\r\nimmoral, offensive, subversive or improper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not, for instance, allow discos and nightclubs to\r\n\r\nbe  set up within residential estates, or game centres to  be\r\n\r\nset  up in HDB shophouses.  We also ensure that the operators\r\n\r\nof  entertainment outlets and organisers of events,  such  as\r\n\r\nrock   concerts,  take  proper  and  adequate  crowd  control\r\n\r\nmeasures to ensure public safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act was last amended in 1979 to ensure its\r\n\r\nrelevancy.   MHA is now proposing several amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nAct  to  improve  the administration of public  entertainment\r\n\r\nlicences.    Essentially,  these  amendments  will  encourage\r\n\r\nlicensees to exercise self-discipline whilst making it easier\r\n\r\nand  more  convenient for businesses to apply for  and  renew\r\n\r\ntheir  public  entertainment  licences.   Changes  are   also\r\n\r\nproposed to update the scope and penalties of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Demerit Point System</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, let me touch on the demerit point system.\r\n\r\nPolice  will  be introducing a demerit point  system  in  the\r\n\r\nadministration of public entertainment licences of  permanent\r\n\r\nestablishments  such  as  computer games  centres,  pubs  and\r\n\r\ndiscos.   Conceptually,  the demerit  point  system  will  be\r\n\r\nsimilar to the Road Traffic Driver Improvement Points  System\r\n\r\n(DIPS).   Under  this system, Police will adopt  a  graduated\r\n\r\nenforcement  approach against licensees  for  infringing  any\r\n\r\nlicensing  conditions.   Licensees  would  be  given  demerit\r\n\r\npoints for breaching any licensing conditions.  Depending  on\r\n\r\nthe  number of demerit points accumulated, appropriate action\r\n\r\nwould  be  taken against the licensee.  This can  range  from\r\n\r\ncurtailing the operating hours of the licensee's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness,  or  requiring the licensee to put  up  a  security\r\n\r\ndeposit.  When the licensee accumulates the maximum number of\r\n\r\npoints,  which will be prescribed in the rules, the licensing\r\n\r\nofficer  can  cancel the PE licence and forfeit the  security\r\n\r\ndeposit.   Details  of  the  demerit  point  system  will  be\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the  rules, which will  be  published  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new demerit point system improves the administration\r\n\r\nof  licences  in  that a licensee would know  the  number  of\r\n\r\ndemerit   points  that  he  accumulates  for  breaching   any\r\n\r\nlicensing  conditions.  He also knows  that  if  he  were  to\r\n\r\nbreach  any licensing condition again, he would face  tougher\r\n\r\nactions.   Hence,  there  is  greater  transparency  in   the\r\n\r\nadministration  of licences compared to the  current  system.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the licensee does not know with certainty what  he\r\n\r\nwould  face  if he were to breach a licensing condition.   He\r\n\r\ncould,  for  example,  receive a warning,  have  his  licence\r\n\r\nsuspended or cancelled, or face court prosecution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the new demerit point system provides early\r\n\r\nwarning  for  minor breaches and encourages the  licensee  to\r\n\r\nexercise  self-discipline.  Each time the knot is  tightened,\r\n\r\nhe  would  have  prior  notice that  action  is  contemplated\r\n\r\nagainst  him.  He would then have an opportunity  to  explain\r\n\r\nwhy  such  action should not be taken.  Further, the licensee\r\n\r\ncan appeal to the Minister if his explanation is rejected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8, 9, 11, 12 and 14 of the Bill make the\r\n\r\nnecessary amendments to the Act to put in place the framework\r\n\r\nfor a demerit point system and related procedures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The licensing officer would still retain the powers, as\r\n\r\nprovided under section 14(1) of the existing Act, to  suspend\r\n\r\nor  cancel a licence immediately, if the situation calls  for\r\n\r\nit.   An  example would be where the public entertainment  is\r\n\r\nwholly or in part indecent, immoral, offensive, subversive or\r\n\r\nimproper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act would also be amended to give the licensing\r\n\r\nofficer discretion to cancel or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuspend a licence if he is satisfied that the licensee is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  fit  and  proper  to  hold  the  licence.   What   is\r\n\r\ncontemplated  here  is where a licensee  is  convicted  of  a\r\n\r\nserious criminal offence during the term of his licence, such\r\n\r\nas drug-related offences, serious sexual offences and violent\r\n\r\ncriminal offences.  This is to safeguard public interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Improving the Administration of PE Licences Validity Period of Licences and Renewal of Licences</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also introduces changes to the validity\r\n\r\nperiod of public entertainment licences to make it easier and\r\n\r\nmore  convenient for businesses.  Clause 6 of the Bill amends\r\n\r\nsection 8 to remove the maximum validity period of 12  months\r\n\r\nfor  a  licence.   Clause 7 amends section 9  to  remove  the\r\n\r\nrequirement for the renewal of a licence to be treated  as  a\r\n\r\nfresh  licence  application.  Hence, the  new  approach  will\r\n\r\nallow  the  licensing officer to issue licences  with  longer\r\n\r\nvalidity  periods  exceeding 12  months,  as  well  as  renew\r\n\r\nlicences  without  the  need for licensees  to  submit  fresh\r\n\r\napplications.   These  changes will  not  only  simplify  the\r\n\r\nadministration  of  public entertainment  licences  but  also\r\n\r\nreduce business costs for licensees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, clause 10 of the Bill amends section 13 to\r\n\r\nallow  the  licensing  officer to refuse  the  renewal  of  a\r\n\r\nlicence.   It  also provides an avenue for  the  licensee  to\r\n\r\nappeal  to  the Minister against the refusal of the licensing\r\n\r\nofficer to renew his licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the other amendments in the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Composition of Offences</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently all offenders under the Act or rules either\r\n\r\nreceive  a police warning or are prosecuted in court even  if\r\n\r\nthe  licence is cancelled or suspended.  This rigid  approach\r\n\r\nis  not  satisfactory.   Why?  Because  some  cases  are  not\r\n\r\nserious enough for Police to charge the offender in Court but\r\n\r\nletting  the  offender off with just a warning is inadequate.\r\n\r\nTo deal with minor breaches more effectively and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpediently, clause 14 inserts a new section 18B  to  empower\r\n\r\nthe  licensing officer to compound offences under the Act  or\r\n\r\nrules.   For  example, licensees who fail  to  display  their\r\n\r\nlicence  prominently or breach licensing conditions,  may  be\r\n\r\noffered  composition  fines  instead  of  being  charged  and\r\n\r\nprosecuted  in  Court.   The amendment  gives  the  licensing\r\n\r\nofficer  the flexibility to deal with minor offences quickly.\r\n\r\nOffences to be made compoundable would be prescribed  in  the\r\n\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Updating the Scope of the PE Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 16 of the Bill seek to amend the Act by\r\n\r\ntransferring   the  definitions  of  \"public  entertainment\",\r\n\r\n\"film\"  and  \"pin table\" from section 2 to a new Schedule  to\r\n\r\nthe  Act.   Under  the  new subsections 2(2)  and  2(3),  the\r\n\r\nMinister  would  be empowered to amend, add to  or  vary  the\r\n\r\nSchedule  by  order published in the Gazette, which  will  be\r\n\r\npresented   to   Parliament.   This  approach  provides   the\r\n\r\nnecessary   flexibility  to  the  Ministry  to   update   the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of \"public entertainment\" in the Act to  keep  up\r\n\r\nwith   latest   developments  in  the  public   entertainment\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of \"public entertainment\" as specified in\r\n\r\nthe  Schedule  has  also been updated.  Activities  that  are\r\n\r\nalready  covered in other Acts, for example, the  display  of\r\n\r\nfireworks,  which is regulated under the Dangerous  Fireworks\r\n\r\nAct,  have  been removed.  Activities that no longer  pose  a\r\n\r\nthreat  to  public  order, such as charitable  distributions,\r\n\r\nauctions  and sales of goods for philanthropic or  charitable\r\n\r\npurposes,  garden  parties, and trade fairs  have  also  been\r\n\r\nremoved.  This will make it more convenient for organisations\r\n\r\nand businesses to conduct these activities, as they would  no\r\n\r\nlonger need to apply for a PE licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised definition of \"public entertainment\" will\r\n\r\nexpressly  include  \"computer games  centre\"  and  \"amusement\r\n\r\ncentre\" to remove any doubt that a licence is required  under\r\n\r\nthe Act for such forms of public entertainment.  On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  obsolete provisions such as \"exhibitions  of  abnormal\r\n\r\npersons\" will be removed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Exempting Statutory Bodies from the PE Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 3(e) of the proposed Schedule to the Act seeks\r\n\r\nto  make  it clear that public entertainment provided  by  or\r\n\r\nunder  the  auspices of the statutory bodies  listed  in  the\r\n\r\nSchedule are exempted from applying for a PE licence.   There\r\n\r\nis   no  need  for  the  licensing  officer  to  license  the\r\n\r\nactivities  provided by statutory bodies as they are  already\r\n\r\nsubject  to  the  supervision  of  their  respective   parent\r\n\r\nMinistries.   The  Schedule sets  out  a  list  drawn  up  in\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  the  parent Ministries  of  38  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies.   These  are  statutory bodies which  provide  public\r\n\r\nentertainment from time to time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Security Deposit for Ad-Hoc Licences</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the licensing officer is unable to forfeit\r\n\r\nthe  security deposits imposed on ad hoc licences for one-off\r\n\r\nevents,  for  example, rock concerts, even  if  there  is  an\r\n\r\ninfringement,  as  the infringement is  usually  detected  or\r\n\r\nreported  after  the event is over and when the  licence  has\r\n\r\nalready  lapsed.  To overcome this problem, clause 9  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  inserts  a  new  subsection  11(4)(c)  to  empower  the\r\n\r\nlicensing officer to forfeit the security deposit, even after\r\n\r\nthe  licence  has  lapsed,  if the public  entertainment  was\r\n\r\nprovided in contravention of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Increase in Penalties</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the maximum fine for offences under the Act\r\n\r\nis  $5,000.  This was last revised in 1979.  Clause 13 of the\r\n\r\nBill  amends  section 18(1) to increase the maximum  fine  to\r\n\r\n$10,000  to  ensure that deterrence remains  effective.   The\r\n\r\nrevision  would give the Courts the discretion  to  impose  a\r\n\r\nhigher penalty where appropriate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Change of Name</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 3 of the Bill seeks to amend the title\r\n\r\nof  the  Act  from  \"Public Entertainments  Act\"  to  \"Public\r\n\r\nEntertainment and Meetings Act\".  The change\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  name is to reflect more accurately the scope of the  Act,\r\n\r\nwhich  also includes public meetings like rallies, talks  and\r\n\r\nforums.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Exempting Other Activities via Exemption Orders</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these amendments to the Public Entertainments\r\n\r\nAct,  MHA  has  also  reviewed other areas  relating  to  the\r\n\r\nlicensing of public entertainment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has decided to exempt from the ambit of the Act,\r\n\r\ncertain  activities,  such  as shows  for  children,  fashion\r\n\r\nshows, and busking, subject to conditions that safeguard  law\r\n\r\nand order, public morality and safety.  Community activities,\r\n\r\nsuch  as dance performances, karaoke singing and magic shows,\r\n\r\norganised by or on behalf of the elected Member of Parliament\r\n\r\nin  his  constituency, would also be exempted.  To  safeguard\r\n\r\nlaw  and  order, public morality and safety, these activities\r\n\r\nwill similarly be subject to conditions such as no vulgar  or\r\n\r\nobscene  gestures  or  remarks  being  made  by  any  of  the\r\n\r\nperformers  and  the  performers are  not  to  be  indecently\r\n\r\nattired.   These changes will be effected by way of exemption\r\n\r\norders   and   do  not  require  amendments  to  the   Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments Act.  Police will announce the details in  due\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Police is studying the feasibility of\r\n\r\nsetting  up  a  One-Stop Licensing Centre to  coordinate  the\r\n\r\nprocessing  of licence applications, so that businesses  need\r\n\r\nto  go  to  only  one  place to apply for  all  the  licences\r\n\r\nrequired to set up an entertainment outlet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as society evolves, people's\r\n\r\naspirations  change.  MHA will continue to  regularly  review\r\n\r\nthe Act from time to time to ensure its relevancy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  in support of the Amendment Bill moved by Assoc.  Prof.\r\n\r\nHo Peng Kee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passing of this Bill, the existing Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments Act will become the  Public Entertainments and\r\n\r\nMeetings  Act.   A notable amendment is in new  section  14A,\r\n\r\nthat is, the demerit point system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This demerit point system is similar to the one\r\n\r\napplicable to our driving licence.  From the social point  of\r\n\r\nview, this can be said to be very special, because under  the\r\n\r\nBill,  there will be an element of self-discipline for  those\r\n\r\nlicensees to conduct themselves in accordance with  the  law.\r\n\r\nI think this is an indication of the maturity of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also notice that the amendment to the Bill does not\r\n\r\ntake  away  the  power of the police to  revoke  any  licence\r\n\r\nwhenever necessary.  The power still remains. In the case  of\r\n\r\nany  performance,  which is obscene, vulgar  or  immoral,  or\r\n\r\ntouching   on   the   racial  or  religious  sensitivity   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  police  reserves the  right  to  revoke  the\r\n\r\nlicence in keeping with the interest of the public.  I  think\r\n\r\nthis is right and proper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amendment Bill, in my view, will not have much\r\n\r\nimpact  on  commercial  activities.   But  I  feel  that  the\r\n\r\namendments  may affect some of the non-commercial activities.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  I  have  in  mind  some  of  the  customs  and\r\n\r\ntraditional practices of  the Chinese community, particularly\r\n\r\nthe seventh-moon festival or the Hungry Ghost Festival.  This\r\n\r\nnew  Amendment  Bill may have some impact on them.   We  know\r\n\r\nthat the Hungry Ghost Festival is a kind of gathering for the\r\n\r\nChinese  community which incorporates some kind of charitable\r\n\r\nactivities, like the auction of auspicious articles with  the\r\n\r\nproceeds   going  to  charitable  causes.    Most  of   these\r\n\r\nactivities  would  include getai (song performances),  puppet\r\n\r\nshows  or even traditional provincial operas.  In his  Second\r\n\r\nReading   speech,  the  Minister  of  State  mentioned   that\r\n\r\nactivities such as the auctions at the Hungry Ghost  Festival\r\n\r\nmay   be  exempted  from  the  Act.   In   other  words,  the\r\n\r\norganisers  do  not  need to apply for a licence  to  conduct\r\n\r\nauctions.    I  think  it is a piece of  good  news  for  the\r\n\r\nChinese community.  But it is not very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclear    whether  the  staging  of  getai,  puppet  show   or\r\n\r\ntraditional  provincial opera in connection with  the  Hungry\r\n\r\nGhost Festival will also be similarly exempted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Schedule, the so-called \"public\r\n\r\nentertainment\" is defined very widely to include performances\r\n\r\nsuch as drama, singing, music, dancing. All these come within\r\n\r\nthe   definition  of  \"public  entertainment\"  and  therefore\r\n\r\nlicences  are  required.  So my question  is  whether  getai,\r\n\r\npuppet  shows,  etc,  could be exempted.   I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State could clarify on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Hungry Ghost Festival or Seventh Moon\r\n\r\nFestival, activities are usually conducted within the densely-populated HDB estates.  Generally speaking, the organisers of\r\n\r\nsuch  activities will have to apply for permission  from  the\r\n\r\ntown  council or the HDB to make use of the car park  or  the\r\n\r\nvacant land for the conduct of such activities.  In the past,\r\n\r\nthey   also  had  to  apply  to  the  police  for  a   public\r\n\r\nentertainment licence as well.  Now, they do not have  to  do\r\n\r\nso.   So  I think it is a good way to help them.  If  we  can\r\n\r\nconsider such activities are traditional in nature and exempt\r\n\r\nthem from having to apply for a public entertainment licence,\r\n\r\nit will be a great convenience to the organisers.  I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister of State will consider my suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to start by\r\n\r\nwelcoming some of the changes that the Minister of State  has\r\n\r\nannounced and emphasised in reading the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demerit point system seems to me to be a good one to\r\n\r\nenhance  self-discipline and transparency for  the  permanent\r\n\r\nestablishments.   When the Minister of State  was  discussing\r\n\r\ndiscos,  pubs and entertainment centres, I was more concerned\r\n\r\nabout  artistic performances and political and  public  talks\r\n\r\nwhich  are  also covered under the Act.  I think  the  Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments  Act (PEA) may be covering in that  sense  too\r\n\r\nmany  types  of different entertainments of very diverse  and\r\n\r\ndifferent character.  For while I am sometimes entertained by\r\n\r\npublic political\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeeches, sometimes in this House too, it is clearly  a  very\r\n\r\ndifferent  form  of enjoyment from a pub  or  disco.   And  I\r\n\r\nwonder   whether  the  system  and  the  personnel  who   can\r\n\r\nadminister one are really suitable to administer both and all\r\n\r\ntypes of entertainments and meetings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments then go on to remove some activities from\r\n\r\nthe  list that require licensing.  It is however widening the\r\n\r\ntitle  to  reflect  their  work  brings  in  these  political\r\n\r\nmeetings  under the Schedule (I believe it is paragraph  2(m)\r\n\r\n\"any play-reading, recital, lecture, talk, address, debate or\r\n\r\ndiscussion\").   I  think in that sense, we have  probably  to\r\n\r\nconsider  if  the time may have come for us to have  separate\r\n\r\nschemes  and personnel to distinguish between entertainments,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  discos  and meetings, and these  public  talks  and\r\n\r\nartistic performances.  There has been controversy and change\r\n\r\nin  the  administration of the Public Entertainments  Act  of\r\n\r\nlate concerning these areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to quickly point out four examples of this\r\n\r\ncontroversy and change.  First, the Government has  seen  fit\r\n\r\nto establish a Speakers' Corner.  Second, as clarified in the\r\n\r\nlast  sitting of Parliament, elected Opposition MPs from  now\r\n\r\nare  allowed  to speak at community functions  in  their  own\r\n\r\nconstituencies and, I believe if I have heard the Minister of\r\n\r\nState correctly, that they can now sing at these meetings too\r\n\r\nwithout  real problems.  And both of these measures  increase\r\n\r\nthe  freedom  of people to speak in public.   The  third  and\r\n\r\nfourth  examples  go the other direction.  Recently,  it  was\r\n\r\nreported that a group of gay and lesbian Singaporeans  wanted\r\n\r\nto  organise  a public forum in Singapore, but  was  refused.\r\n\r\nAnd  fourth, and more recently, the performance of  the  play\r\n\r\n\"Talaq\" by the civic group Agni Kootthu was refused.  This is\r\n\r\ndespite an initial approval by the National Arts Council.  In\r\n\r\nthese  latter two examples, the licensing authority had  used\r\n\r\nthe PEA to restrict freedom of speech.  These trends may seem\r\n\r\ncontradictory to some.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On what basis should we allow or restrict freedom of\r\n\r\nspeech  and assembly under this Act?  A process should govern\r\n\r\nthe   decision   making.   Article  14  of  the  Constitution\r\n\r\nenshrines the right of Singapore citizens to speak freely and\r\n\r\nto  assemble  peaceably  in public.   These  rights  are  not\r\n\r\nabsolute, of course.  The right to assembly can be restricted\r\n\r\nin  the  interest  of security and public  order,  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State has emphasised.  But how do we decide  when\r\n\r\nsecurity  and  public order are at stake?  Who decides?   The\r\n\r\nGovernment, of course, is the primary actor.  It should  not,\r\n\r\nhowever, in my view, be the only one.  To balance our freedom\r\n\r\nto  speak, with due concerns of security and public order, we\r\n\r\nmust have a good reading of public opinion.  After all, it is\r\n\r\nnot  just  what somebody might say, but how it is  said  and,\r\n\r\nmost importantly, how people react to the speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The example of the play \"Talaq\" points to the diversity\r\n\r\nof  opinions among Singaporeans.  The play had been performed\r\n\r\nbefore.    It   attracted  some  controversy  and  attention.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the past, when the licence was permitted for \"M\r\n\r\nButterfly\"  with  a  nude male figure  on  stage,  this  also\r\n\r\nattracted  some controversy, perhaps a little curiosity  too.\r\n\r\nBut  none  of these things led to violence or public disorder\r\n\r\nand  disturbance.  Instead, we have actually  benefited  from\r\n\r\nthe discussion of the issues that ensued.  Even in the denial\r\n\r\nof  the  licence to have a forum on gays and lesbians,  there\r\n\r\nwas  a  spirited debate, both for and against, in  the  Forum\r\n\r\npages of the Straits Times. And I believe such discussion  is\r\n\r\nhealthy in a democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It therefore has disturbed some people in Singapore to\r\n\r\nhear  how  decisions are made - one moment  allowed,  another\r\n\r\nmoment disallowed.  And it is hard to see, it is hard  to  be\r\n\r\nassured  that  the state's view really reflects the  majority\r\n\r\nview  or whether it reflects the objections of really a vocal\r\n\r\nminority.  It should therefore be welcomed to have a one-stop\r\n\r\ncentre  for  licensing, as the Minister  of  State  says  the\r\n\r\npolice  will now consider.  However, one should guard against\r\n\r\na  one-stop centre becoming a place to stop one.  That is  to\r\n\r\nsay, we put such an emphasis on a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none-stop   centre  to  ensure  that  this  centre  is   truly\r\n\r\nreflective of the broad society and decisions therefore  need\r\n\r\nto  be  more transparent.  They cannot be left to a policeman\r\n\r\nor  bureaucrat  sitting by himself in the  isolation  of  his\r\n\r\noffice.   Nor  can  a decision be captured  by  a  particular\r\n\r\ninterest.   Otherwise,  we  risk acting  on  each  and  every\r\n\r\nspecial sensitivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every one has its sensitivities - every ethnic group,\r\n\r\nevery  religious group, political views, animal  rights,  gay\r\n\r\nactivists,  women's  groups, whatever.  We  cannot  make  our\r\n\r\ndecisions  as  an  accumulation and aggregate  of  all  these\r\n\r\nprejudices.  We have to decide for the broad majority and  to\r\n\r\nallow   diversity.   Because  public  debate   and   artistic\r\n\r\nperformances, in particular, will almost always challenge the\r\n\r\nideas  that some people will hold.  It provokes us to  think,\r\n\r\nand  that  is good.  So long as the line is that  we  provoke\r\n\r\nthought rather than violence and disorder.  In this sense, my\r\n\r\nfirst  suggestion  is that we must include  citizens  in  the\r\n\r\ndecision-making  about  public  entertainment  licences.   We\r\n\r\nshould  have  an advisory panel for the Public Entertainments\r\n\r\nAct.   If we want to cover an even wider array of activities,\r\n\r\nit  is  critical  to have expertise and a broad  and  diverse\r\n\r\nrange  of  opinions,  not captured by any minority  interest.\r\n\r\nThe  Government, of course, in the end will have to make  the\r\n\r\ndecision after hearing the different views.  But it should do\r\n\r\nso  after hearing all sides and weighing the overall interest\r\n\r\nof the wider society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion, Sir, is that the Government should\r\n\r\nuse  its powers to impose special conditions for the approval\r\n\r\nwisely.  It does this already.  But I want to point out  that\r\n\r\nit may continue to have performances in form or even warn the\r\n\r\nrespective  audience  beforehand of its  contents,  and  then\r\n\r\nthose  who  may  be offended simply need not  attend.   These\r\n\r\nsuggestions are not new.  They are in line with the  practice\r\n\r\nof  censorship of films and publications in Singapore.  Under\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Information and the Arts, a panel of citizens\r\n\r\ngives  advice to the bureaucrats on what to censor and  gives\r\n\r\nthem  a  good sense of the pulse of the people of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAnd so we have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"RA\"  classification, advisory statement of the content, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd in this sense, my suggestions on this Bill are simply  to\r\n\r\nbring  it  into  line with the practices on  film  and  other\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third suggestion, Sir, relates to the Speakers'\r\n\r\nCorner.   This  experiment has been running for  some  months\r\n\r\nnow.   There have not been, to my knowledge, any breaches  in\r\n\r\nsecurity or public order and I do not believe there have been\r\n\r\nany  other  breaches  of law, such as  defamation.   In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  the  Speakers' Corner should be seen as  a  success.\r\n\r\nPeople  have spoken and nothing has caught fire.  Yet,  there\r\n\r\nare  also  concerns that the success of the Speakers'  Corner\r\n\r\nwill be limited, in part this is because of the venue and the\r\n\r\nmeans  of communication.  In our tropical city, both  weather\r\n\r\nand  traffic  noise  work against an  open  air  venue  where\r\n\r\nmicrophones are not allowed.  I therefore ask the Ministry to\r\n\r\nconsider  designating an indoor venue for a second  Speakers'\r\n\r\nCorner with a speaker system to support the speakers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the civic society group, the Roundtable, of\r\n\r\nwhich  I  am  one, first proposed free speech venues  with  a\r\n\r\nvariety  of  places and types.  When the Government  took  up\r\n\r\nthis  idea, it only licensed Hong Lim Park.  This is  because\r\n\r\nit  is  a historical site and I have got nothing against  it.\r\n\r\nBut  I  do hope the Government will review the scheme to  add\r\n\r\nmore supportive venues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to express my\r\n\r\ndistaste  for  this Bill.  But may I make it  clear  that  my\r\n\r\nobjections  do  not  flow  from the  requirement  for  proper\r\n\r\nlicensing  and  regulation of animal circuses and  those  who\r\n\r\noperate  pin  tables and games of chance.  My  objections  to\r\n\r\nthis Bill and, indeed, to the main Act itself, stem from  the\r\n\r\nfact  that the main Act and this Bill make a mockery  of  our\r\n\r\nConstitution  in  that, as Mr Simon Tay has pointed  out,  it\r\n\r\nseeks  to  include public meetings and to lump them  together\r\n\r\nwith  circuses  and exhibitions of animals and operations  of\r\n\r\ngames of chance, and what else.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked several times by\r\n\r\nforeign  correspondents and visitors whether I did not  think\r\n\r\nthat the Government was liberalising its restrictions on  the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of speech, and my answer has always been  \"No\",  and\r\n\r\nthey then wonder why I take this view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill confirms my view. One would have thought that\r\n\r\nthe  Government might have considered that the time  has  now\r\n\r\ncome to remove the restrictions on public meetings, talks and\r\n\r\nlectures.   But  no,  it  seeks to include  public  meetings,\r\n\r\nlectures  and talks in this total control over  any  form  of\r\n\r\npublic expression in this country.  It makes, as I have said,\r\n\r\na mockery of the constitutional right expressed by Article 14\r\n\r\nof our Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay would appear to suggest that there should\r\n\r\nbe  a separate scheme for meetings and talks.  I do not agree\r\n\r\nwith  that.   I  am  saying the time has  now  come  to  lift\r\n\r\ncompletely,   and,   I   repeat,  to  lift   completely   any\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on public meetings and talks or lectures  of  a\r\n\r\nserious  nature and allow complete freedom of speech,  as  is\r\n\r\nrequired  by  the  Constitution.  That is  why  I  felt  very\r\n\r\nunhappy  when  I  saw this Public Entertainments  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, in spite of all its avowed statements\r\n\r\nthat  there  was freedom of speech, freedom of expression  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the Deputy Prime Minister telling  the  BBC  that\r\n\r\nanyone is free to debate in Singapore, they still see fit  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  Bill  tightening further, if  I  may  say,  the\r\n\r\nrestrictions on meetings of a serious nature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say it makes a mockery of our Constitution. I say, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  that the Public Entertainments  Act  violates\r\n\r\nArticle 14(1)(a) of the Constitution.  If you look at Article\r\n\r\n14(1)(a), Mr Speaker, Sir, what do you find?  \"Every  citizen\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  has  the  right  to  freedom  of  speech  and\r\n\r\nexpression.\"   May I repeat: \"Every citizen of Singapore  has\r\n\r\nthe right to freedom of speech and expression.\"  However, it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinues, by Article 14(2)(a), to give Parliament the  right\r\n\r\nto  impose  \"such restrictions as it considers  necessary  or\r\n\r\nexpedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any\r\n\r\npart thereof.\"  I do not wish to read the rest of it, but the\r\n\r\noperative part of this is, to impose \"such restrictions as it\r\n\r\nconsiders necessary\".  It does not say that you can  abrogate\r\n\r\nthe  right  of  the citizen.  The right of the  citizen  must\r\n\r\nremain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By requiring the citizen to first go and obtain a\r\n\r\nlicence from a police officer is to take away his right under\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution.  If one has to obtain a licence, then  one\r\n\r\ncannot  truthfully say that one has the right.  His right  is\r\n\r\nmade  dependent on the whim of the officer to whom he has  to\r\n\r\nmake the application.  It is no longer a right.  It becomes a\r\n\r\nlicence  granted by the Government, and not a  right  of  the\r\n\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I say, Sir, that the Act itself is a complete\r\n\r\nnegation  of Article 14(1)(a) of our Constitution.  And  this\r\n\r\nAct  should  have  been  amended, once the  Constitution  was\r\n\r\nbrought  into force, to take out of the Public Entertainments\r\n\r\nAct the provisions relating to meetings, lectures, talks of a\r\n\r\nserious  nature,  and,  particularly, meetings  organised  by\r\n\r\nregistered  political parties.  That should have  been  done,\r\n\r\nbut was not done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind the Minister and the Government that the\r\n\r\nConstitution  itself  enjoins,  requires  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nmodify  the law so as to accord with the right given  by  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  But nothing was done to modify  the  law,  and\r\n\r\nthe  total  ban on public expression in the form of  meetings\r\n\r\nand  talks  was continued.  So, I say, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nwhole thing is a mockery of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at section 13 of the parent Act, what do you\r\n\r\nfind, Mr Speaker, Sir?  It reads: \"The licensing officer may,\r\n\r\nin  his  discretion, refuse any application for  a  licence.\"\r\n\r\nThere   you  have  it.   The  Act  says,  forget  about   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  We can refuse any application for a licence to\r\n\r\nspeak  and  we can stop anyone speaking out in  public.   One\r\n\r\nwould have thought\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat,  in  the Amendment Bill, perhaps an attempt would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  to  spell out clearly the grounds  on  which  the\r\n\r\nlicensing  officer  may refuse the application.   Instead  of\r\n\r\nthat, this carte blanche freedom is continued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that perhaps we should consider now changing\r\n\r\nthe  designation  of  the officer as \"Licensing  Officer\"  to\r\n\r\n\"Licensing  Czar\"  under the Government.  That  perhaps  will\r\n\r\nexplain  clearly  that  the  Government  continues  to   hold\r\n\r\nunrestricted  control over the right of anyone  to  speak  in\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at section 14 of the parent Act, it again\r\n\r\ngives this \"licensing czar\" grounds to cancel or suspend  any\r\n\r\nlicence without again tying him down.  I say this because, if\r\n\r\nyou look at section 14(1)(d), you will find the words \"If  it\r\n\r\nis  contrary  to the public interest.\"  So this  official  is\r\n\r\ngiven  the  authority to decide what is the public  interest.\r\n\r\nBut  the  Constitution says clearly, in no  uncertain  terms,\r\n\r\nthat  it is in the public interest that every citizen  should\r\n\r\nhave   the  right  of  freedom  of  expression  without   any\r\n\r\nrestriction  put  upon it, except in the very  limited  areas\r\n\r\nspecified under the Constitution.  And what is more, the  Act\r\n\r\ndid  not provide an appeal to the courts against any decision\r\n\r\nand this is continued in the Bill that is now before us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a matter so important as the right of citizens to\r\n\r\nspeak up, should not the decision be left to the court rather\r\n\r\nthan  to  the  official, and from him  to  the  Minister?   I\r\n\r\nmentioned not very long ago that the licensing officer, in  a\r\n\r\ncase   where  we  were  charged  with  violating  the  Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments  Act, said on oath in the witness  stand  that\r\n\r\napplications   from   political  parties  are   automatically\r\n\r\nreferred  to the Minister. The decision is taken out  of  his\r\n\r\nhands  and the Minister decides whether it should be  granted\r\n\r\nor not.  If that is the case, what on earth will be served by\r\n\r\nallowing the political party to appeal to the Minister? He is\r\n\r\nasked  to  review his own decision, not the decision  of  the\r\n\r\nlicensing officer?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is sincere in its oft-stated desire to\r\n\r\ninvite our citizens to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak up, there should have been an opportunity for the\r\n\r\ncitizen to take his case to the  court so that the court  may\r\n\r\ndecide  whether  the  right under the Constitution  is  being\r\n\r\nviolated  by the decision of the Minister.  I would seriously\r\n\r\nurge  the Ministry to refer the whole Act, not just the Bill,\r\n\r\nto  the  Constitutional Court for an opinion whether the  Act\r\n\r\nand  the  scheme of licensing provided under the Act  violate\r\n\r\nArticle  14(1) of the Constitution.  I see that the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home  Affairs laughs at my suggestion that it should  be\r\n\r\nreferred  to the Constitutional Court. That is what I  always\r\n\r\nhave had when I suggest that it be referred to the court.  It\r\n\r\nshows  very little respect for the court.  And please do  not\r\n\r\ntell  me in reply that I can always take it up to the  court.\r\n\r\nIf the Government is accountable to the people, as it says it\r\n\r\nis  an  accountable Government and it is transparent  in  its\r\n\r\ndecision-making, it would immediately, upon a complaint  that\r\n\r\nany  legislation violates the Constitution, refer it  to  the\r\n\r\nConstitutional  Court.  So  please  act  responsibly  as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is accountable to the people and not laugh away at\r\n\r\nany suggestion that we should refer the matter to the court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I commend to the Ministry that if they do not wish\r\n\r\nto  refer the Bill, along with the Act, to the Constitutional\r\n\r\nCourt,  it  should  now  withdraw this  Bill  and  reconsider\r\n\r\nwhether it should proceed with the Bill as at present  before\r\n\r\nthe  House.  I would ask the Ministry to consider taking  out\r\n\r\ncompletely  from the Bill sub-paragraph (m) in  the  Schedule\r\n\r\nwhich defines \"public entertainment\".  Sub-paragraph (m),  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  relates  to  play-reading, recital,  lecture,  talk,\r\n\r\naddress  debate or discussion.  And introduce in  this  Bill,\r\n\r\nother  provisions  that require not the applicant  to  get  a\r\n\r\nlicence  but require the police to object for grounds  stated\r\n\r\nto  any  intention on the part of any political party or  any\r\n\r\nparty or association to hold a public meeting or talk.  May I\r\n\r\nask what is the objection, and I do want a serious answer  to\r\n\r\nthis.   What  is  your  objection to a public  meeting  in  a\r\n\r\nprivate  closed  place like a hotel or  somebody's  house  or\r\n\r\nbuilding?  One can understand some objection if it is  to  be\r\n\r\non  a  public  street or in a public area, but  what  is  the\r\n\r\nobjection\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  a meeting in a closed room where the public is invited to\r\n\r\nattend?   The  OSC,  of  which I am Chairman,  has  held  two\r\n\r\nforums.   True, we got licences, but after having to  satisfy\r\n\r\nthe  licensing officer that we were not going to  be  talking\r\n\r\nabout  subversion, and we were only given the licence  almost\r\n\r\nat the last minute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, Sir, that if this Government wishes to show\r\n\r\nitself  as  law-abiding  and respects  the  Constitution,  it\r\n\r\nshould  take away this requirement for the licence and  bring\r\n\r\nin  provisions to require the police to lodge any  objections\r\n\r\nwith  a  Magistrate  to  any proposed meeting  of  which  the\r\n\r\napplicant should give three weeks' notice before the  meeting\r\n\r\nand  then the Magistrate or some officer, hearing both sides,\r\n\r\ndecides  whether the meeting should be allowed or not.   That\r\n\r\nwould  accord  with the Constitution and would prove  to  the\r\n\r\nworld  that this Government is serious when it says  that  it\r\n\r\nwishes  to  promote  public  debate  and  discussion  by  its\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay says that the Speakers' Corner has been a\r\n\r\nsuccess.  I do not know on what grounds he says that.  It was\r\n\r\nonly  yesterday that I read in the Straits Times which  asks,\r\n\r\n\"Is  the Speakers' Corner dying a natural death?\"  There  are\r\n\r\nvery few speakers and very few people listening to them.   I,\r\n\r\nfor  one,  may  I  say, am glad that it has  been  completely\r\n\r\nignored by responsible Singapore citizens because I have said\r\n\r\nit  right  from  the beginning that I was not going  to  show\r\n\r\nmyself   up  there.  That  would  lend  credibility  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  claim  that the Speakers' Corner  is  proof  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy in this country, where there is no such thing.  The\r\n\r\nSpeakers'  Corner  was intended to be a showpiece,  like  the\r\n\r\nwayang  kulit and to proclaim to people that, there you  are,\r\n\r\nwe  have  got  democracy, we have got freedom of  expression,\r\n\r\nwhen  this Bill and the Act completely take away that freedom\r\n\r\nof expression of the citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do seriously urge the Government to do one of two\r\n\r\nthings.   Withdraw  this  Bill  and  refer  the  Act  to  the\r\n\r\nConstitutional\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt  for  a pronouncement on whether the ban on  talks  and\r\n\r\nlectures  violates Article 14(1) of the Constitution  and  if\r\n\r\nthe Government is not willing to do that, as I have said,  to\r\n\r\nreconsider  whether the whole scheme of licensing should  now\r\n\r\nbe revised in relation to public meetings, talks or lectures,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those organised by political  associations  and\r\n\r\nthat  would  include  not only political  parties  registered\r\n\r\nunder  the  Societies Act, but NGOs and civic groups,  groups\r\n\r\nlike my organisation, the Open Singapore Centre.  Then, as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said,  it  would  speak volumes for  this  Government's\r\n\r\nsincerity to promote discussion and debate in Singapore.   If\r\n\r\nit  does  not do that, may I say it is all empty  words,  all\r\n\r\nhocus-pocus, that Singapore enjoys freedom of speech, freedom\r\n\r\nof expression.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, first, I wish to express my concern about  the\r\n\r\npossible negative impact the proposed amendments will have on\r\n\r\narts and civil society.  I, like many other Singaporeans,  am\r\n\r\ndelighted to have witnessed  the growth of arts in Singapore.\r\n\r\nI must compliment the Government for the vision and effort to\r\n\r\nnurture the development of arts here.  But I feel that it  is\r\n\r\ntimely that we have specific legislation that will be able to\r\n\r\nguide  this development.  Of course, we also need  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the social norms and the acceptable moral standards  of\r\n\r\nour society are protected and not compromised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artistes are like scientists - researching,\r\n\r\nquestioning, experimenting and sometimes pushing and  testing\r\n\r\nconventional  acceptable norms of the  day.   Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nBill  must  reflect  the tolerance for  a  possible  negative\r\n\r\noutcome  of  this experiment, but make clear  the  boundaries\r\n\r\nwithin  which the arts groups are allowed to operate.   I  am\r\n\r\ntherefore  concerned that instead of taking this  opportunity\r\n\r\nto  refine the Bill to be more specific to the arts, we  have\r\n\r\nenlarged  it  to include perhaps just about anybody  else  by\r\n\r\nincluding  meetings  under  this  amendment.   I  would  have\r\n\r\npreferred that all other matters of public order be  included\r\n\r\nin other legislation,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the Penal Code, the Miscellaneous Offences  (Public\r\n\r\nOrder  and  Nuisance) Act and the Societies Act.   There  are\r\n\r\nenough   legislation  to  regulate  such   public   meetings.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, as it stands now, the legislation may be  seen  as\r\n\r\ntoo  restrictive  for an otherwise very liberal  and  growing\r\n\r\narts scene.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By enlarging this Bill, I am afraid that we will not be\r\n\r\nable  to  solve the perception problems caused by the charges\r\n\r\nbrought  against Chee Soon Juan when he launched his book  at\r\n\r\nRaffles Place sometime ago.  Many outside Singapore interpret\r\n\r\nthe   use   of   the  Public  Entertainments  Act   and   the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental and Public Health Act as a desperate attempt by\r\n\r\nthe  Government to use inappropriate legislation  against  an\r\n\r\nopposition  figure.   Clearly,  we  do  not  deserve  such  a\r\n\r\nreputation  but neither do we need to give others  an  excuse\r\n\r\nfor  perceiving us as such.  Although Singaporeans are  fully\r\n\r\naware  of his defiant attitude resulting in the charges being\r\n\r\nmade  against him, the use of the Public Entertainments  Act,\r\n\r\nfor example, has caused some confusion.  Therefore, we should\r\n\r\ntake  this  opportunity to make this Bill purely  for  public\r\n\r\nentertainment  and  not  for any  other  offences.   We  must\r\n\r\nseparate  arts  from  politics and make a  clear  distinction\r\n\r\nbetween   the  regulations  for  entertainers  and  that   of\r\n\r\npoliticians.   Even  if  this amendment  is  made  purely  to\r\n\r\nenhance  our image overseas and ensure that people  have  the\r\n\r\nright view on this matter, it would be a worthwhile exercise,\r\n\r\nbecause what others think of us matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on a number of specific issues. Clearly,\r\n\r\nsection 13 should be read in conjunction with Article  14  of\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution which guarantees citizens the right to free\r\n\r\nspeech,  assembly  and association.  I  have  very  different\r\n\r\nviews from Mr J B Jeyaretnam, because I think the significant\r\n\r\npoint  in Article 14(2)(a) empowers Parliament to impose  any\r\n\r\nrestriction it considers necessary and expedient to serve the\r\n\r\npurpose  inherent in eight stipulated grounds of  derogation.\r\n\r\nThus, when someone puts in an application for a licence,  the\r\n\r\nlicensing officer is constitutionally required to approve the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication unless it falls within one of the eight heads  of\r\n\r\nArticle  14(2)(a).  If the licensing officer  feels  that  he\r\n\r\nmust reject the application for one of these reasons, and for\r\n\r\nthose   reasons  only,  he  must  give  reasons.   Therefore,\r\n\r\namendment  should be made to section 13(2)  to  reflect  this\r\n\r\ndefault position.  Thus, the onus is on the licensing officer\r\n\r\nto  give  reasons  for  his denial of  an  application.   The\r\n\r\napplicant  need  not  have to ask for  the  grounds  for  the\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, in the recent Talaq case, the licensing officer\r\n\r\nhas consulted other relevant bodies.  But why not embody this\r\n\r\nprocess  in  the  Bill  to reflect a more  participatory  and\r\n\r\nconsultative  style of government?  Why  not  spell  out  the\r\n\r\nbodies  or  organisations which need  to  be  consulted?   Or\r\n\r\nestablish a body which has a representation from a wide cross-section  of  the  society to advise the Public  Entertainment\r\n\r\nLicensing Unit?  It will then give some of the bodies a legal\r\n\r\nstatus  to make its decision and recommendation and  possibly\r\n\r\navoid  the  confusion caused by the recent issue.    In  this\r\n\r\ninstance,  the licensing officer has consulted  the  National\r\n\r\nArts Council and other bodies.  But who really is making  the\r\n\r\ndecision?  Is it the Public Entertainment Licensing Unit?  Is\r\n\r\nit  the  National  Arts Council?  Or is it the  Majlis  Ugama\r\n\r\nIslam Singapura?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these groups are to be relied upon to give advice,\r\n\r\nwhat  and  how  much  weight must be given  to  their  views?\r\n\r\nShould  not the licensing officer consult these bodies  first\r\n\r\nbefore  making  a final decision?  Thus, the  procedures  and\r\n\r\nprocesses in making this decision must be clearly spelt out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For civil society, Sir, it does not exempt groups\r\n\r\norganising talks and seminars and the like from applying  for\r\n\r\na  licence unless it is a \"members only\" meeting.  Thus, if a\r\n\r\ncivil society group decides to hold a talk for an \"invitation\r\n\r\nonly\" audience, technically, the group will still have to get\r\n\r\na public entertainment licence.  This is not helpful at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of a demerit point system is interesting,\r\n\r\nbut totally lacking in detail.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? What is the rush in pushing this Bill through?\r\n\r\nAlthough the Minister has stated that details of the  demerit\r\n\r\npoint  system will follow, why can we not come  up  with  the\r\n\r\nscheme  before voting on it?  I would have thought  that  the\r\n\r\ndemerit  point  system should be debated and  scrutinised  in\r\n\r\nParliament.  Otherwise, this is very much like having traffic\r\n\r\nrules and demerit point system, but the driver does not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the  rules and how the demerit point system  works\r\n\r\nagainst  him.   If there are OB markers, as it should  be  in\r\n\r\nsome cases, why not spell them?  Otherwise, the vagueness and\r\n\r\nthe  lack  of clarity make it confusing for arts  groups  and\r\n\r\ncivil society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J B Jeyaretnam spoke about the Speakers' Corner. I\r\n\r\nam  extremely disappointed with his attitude.  I  would  have\r\n\r\nthought  that with the establishment of the Speakers' Corner,\r\n\r\nit is precisely the Opposition groups who will take advantage\r\n\r\nof this, because they have been clamouring for more space and\r\n\r\nopportunity  to speak to the public at large.  And  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  Mr Jeyaretnam has taken the attitude and the fact  that\r\n\r\nhe  is  not here to listen to the reply from the Minister  is\r\n\r\nsomething that I find very disturbing myself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speakers' Corner is not just a reflection of the\r\n\r\nsociety  at large but, certainly, the state of the  Speakers'\r\n\r\nCorner  is  a reflection of the Opposition members themselves\r\n\r\nand  other groups who want to have an additional platform  to\r\n\r\nmake their views known.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am  sure  the  Minister  of  State  will  answer  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam's points, but I would just like to say one  thing.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I am quite astonished at the suggestion or the legal\r\n\r\ntheory  propounded  by  him that  there  is  a  duty  on  any\r\n\r\ngovernment  to  challenge  its own  Bills  on  constitutional\r\n\r\ngrounds.  I have never heard of such an argument put  in  any\r\n\r\njurisdiction that I know of.  Obviously, the simple  case  is\r\n\r\nthat  if a citizen feels aggrieved and he has a locus  standi\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstanding  to raise an issue before the courts, he can  always\r\n\r\ngo  to  the courts for a declaration.  There is no such thing\r\n\r\nalso  as  unrestricted constitutional rights  to  freedom  of\r\n\r\nexpression, even in that most democratic of democracies,  the\r\n\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if I may be allowed to speak in relation to\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.   I  support this Bill in so far as  it  seeks  to\r\n\r\nupdate the law and especially by removing activities that  no\r\n\r\nlonger  require  licences and by streamlining procedures  for\r\n\r\nissue  and  renewal of licences.  This is an important  Bill,\r\n\r\ncoming  as it does in the wake of earlier concerns in January\r\n\r\nthis  year  about the operations of the Licensing  Unit  and,\r\n\r\nmore  recently, of course, about the play Talaq that was  not\r\n\r\nallowed to be staged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this debate, I would like to touch on two sets\r\n\r\nof  issues.   The  first relates to issues of substance,  ie,\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the  factors to be considered in the  granting  of\r\n\r\nlicences  and  whether there will be changes in  this  regard\r\n\r\nafter  the enactment of the Bill.  The second relates to  the\r\n\r\nprocess and procedure of obtaining a licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of public entertainment, there is always an\r\n\r\nissue of balancing the objective of encouraging creative  and\r\n\r\nnew  art  forms,  and what may be called the  maintenance  of\r\n\r\npublic decency and order.  In the Films Act, for example,  we\r\n\r\nhave an elaborate system of obtaining licences or permits  to\r\n\r\nshow films and to have films censored.  In the case of public\r\n\r\nentertainment  falling within the Public Entertainments  Act,\r\n\r\nthe  same concerns arise.  What is the proper balance  to  be\r\n\r\nstruck between allowing our artistic talents to entertain the\r\n\r\npublic and maintaining public decency and order?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sitting on 17th January this year, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Information and the Arts gave an answer which  is  quite\r\n\r\nrelevant  in  today's debate.  The Minister referred  to  the\r\n\r\nneed  for artistes to obtain licence for new art forms,  such\r\n\r\nas  forum,  theatre and performance arts, where there  is  no\r\n\r\nscript and encourages participation of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naudience.   Controversy arose in this case  because  of  some\r\n\r\nindecent  and unconventional behaviour on the part of  actors\r\n\r\nduring a performance several years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer given by the Minister - may I be permitted\r\n\r\nto  summarise  -  contains four factors that should be  taken\r\n\r\ninto  account.   First, the broad factor of  risk  to  public\r\n\r\norder and decency; second, the exploitative nature of the art\r\n\r\nform  to  educate  audiences on volatile issues;  third,  the\r\n\r\npropagation  of beliefs and messages of deviant groups;  and,\r\n\r\nfinally, the use of the art forms as a means of subversion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to these factors because the fundamental issue\r\n\r\nof substance for having a licensing scheme to regulate public\r\n\r\nentertainment   is  striking  that  proper  balance   between\r\n\r\nartistic  freeedom  and  maintenance  of  public  order   and\r\n\r\ndecency.  The Bill appears to make the Licensing Unit and the\r\n\r\nMinister  in  charge, namely, the Minister for Home  Affairs,\r\n\r\nresponsible  as  the guardian of public order  and  morality,\r\n\r\nunlike  the Films Act, for example, where there is an  appeal\r\n\r\nto  a  wider  body  known  as the  committee  of  appeal.  In\r\n\r\nsubstance,  both the showing of a film and the staging  of  a\r\n\r\nplay,  for  example, are not different.  I  am  puzzled  that\r\n\r\nthere  is such a distinction made here and that there  is  no\r\n\r\nappeal body in this particular piece of legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can also be seen from the factors referred to that\r\n\r\nthere  are  very  broad considerations  that  involve  public\r\n\r\nmorality which probably could be better gauged by a  body  of\r\n\r\nindividuals culled from various segments of society.  I know,\r\n\r\nfor  instance,  that  in the recent controversial  play,  the\r\n\r\npermission  to  stage it was withdrawn after objections  from\r\n\r\nMUIS.    Why   not   have   an  appellate   body   comprising\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from organisations such as MUIS  or  National\r\n\r\nArts  Council, who could then recommend to the Minister on  a\r\n\r\nmore regulated basis?  If we are serious about improving  the\r\n\r\ncultural  arts  scene in Singapore, we may  need  more  civil\r\n\r\nsociety  mechanisms  to ensure that we are  not  erring  from\r\n\r\nexcessive caution.  I would like therefore to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nurge  the  Minister of State to consider  such  a  scheme  as\r\n\r\nappropriate for the Public Entertainments Act, as it  is  for\r\n\r\nthe Films Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also proposes to implement a demerit point\r\n\r\nsystem.  Such systems are common in Singapore, principally in\r\n\r\nmatters relating to public health and road safety.  Again,  I\r\n\r\nshould  like  to ask the Minister of State for clarification,\r\n\r\nas  some  of the speakers earlier have done so.  What purpose\r\n\r\nwould  such  a  demerit system serve in the  area  of  public\r\n\r\nentertainment?  We can see the need for such a scheme in  the\r\n\r\nareas of public hygiene and road safety, where the public may\r\n\r\nbe  subject  to daily risks of dirty food or unsafe  driving.\r\n\r\nBut  in  public  entertainment, the harm that may  result  is\r\n\r\nsurely not as direct or severe as to require a demerit  point\r\n\r\nsystem.   Has  the  situation deteriorated so  much  that  we\r\n\r\nshould consider implementing a demerit point system?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Minister of State can provide an\r\n\r\nexplanation  as to why such a system should be put  in  place\r\n\r\nand  how  it would operate.  And, in particular, I  echo  the\r\n\r\nissue that was raised by Mr Zulkifli whether it would have an\r\n\r\nundesirable  effect  on  the  cultural  and  arts  scene   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The harm that we would want most to avoid is that\r\n\r\nour  most  creative  artistes go  abroad  and  develop  their\r\n\r\ntalents  instead of remaining at home.  This must not happen,\r\n\r\nas  a  result of a scheme that is seen to be too restrictive.\r\n\r\nI  would  urge the Minister of State to let Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and the public know what are the principles that  will\r\n\r\nbe  used to administer this demerit point system.  And it  is\r\n\r\nunfortunate that the rules relating to such a scheme are  not\r\n\r\nplaced before the House at this time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to other issues that arise from the\r\n\r\nBill.  While matters of substance are very important, matters\r\n\r\nof  procedure may also be important in that a long drawn  out\r\n\r\nprocedure  to  obtain licences may be viewed as unsympathetic\r\n\r\nto  the  growth  of a vibrant public entertainment  scene  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   While  the  Bill positively  aids  in  promoting\r\n\r\npublic entertainment maybe in the new provision that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroups  performing  under the auspices of  certain  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies  like the People's Association, National Arts Council,\r\n\r\nMUIS  and  the National Library Board can now provide  public\r\n\r\nentertainment  without requiring a licence.  There  are  many\r\n\r\nstatutory  bodies that are given this exemption.   But  there\r\n\r\nmay  be  a  case  for  including other  bodies  such  as  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Academy of Law and Info-Communications Development\r\n\r\nAuthority  of  Singapore.  These are not in  the  list.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  why  are they not because  they  too  have  on\r\n\r\noccasions put on public shows?  On the other hand, it is  odd\r\n\r\nto  find the inclusion of the Professional Engineers Board or\r\n\r\nthe  Board  of  Architects on this list.  In  fact,  not  all\r\n\r\nprofessional  bodies are on the list. For  example,  the  Law\r\n\r\nSociety of Singapore, which regularly runs meetings and  road\r\n\r\nshows  to  advise people of rights and so on, is not  on  the\r\n\r\nlist.   Perhaps  the Minister of State can clarify  how  this\r\n\r\nlist  came  about and whether it would be revised at  regular\r\n\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the problem I raised earlier in January\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  time taken for processing applications.   In\r\n\r\nJanuary  this year, the Minister for Home Affairs answered  a\r\n\r\nquestion  relating  to  this matter and  his  answer  was  as\r\n\r\nfollows, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Police has publicly pledged to process 90% of all\r\n\r\nestablishment licence applications within eight weeks and  ad\r\n\r\nhoc licence applications within three weeks.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  further  added  that  in  1999,  more  than  50%  of  all\r\n\r\napplications  were  processed within a week  while  91%  were\r\n\r\nprocessed  within three weeks.  This may suggest a  situation\r\n\r\nthat  is  relatively under control and that the police  acted\r\n\r\nreasonably  speedily  and they should  be  congratulated  for\r\n\r\nthat.  But I hope that the Minister of State can reassure  us\r\n\r\nthat there will be a better effort made to expedite licensing\r\n\r\nprocedures and also ultimately to cut down on the  number  of\r\n\r\nactivities for which a licence is necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, creative talents require a certain space where\r\n\r\ninvolvement of people\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould be spontaneous and immediate.  Such situations are not\r\n\r\nlikely  to  occur in Singapore if we exert too  much  control\r\n\r\nover  the  expression of creativity in public.  I agree  that\r\n\r\nthere  must  be some control where public safety,  health  or\r\n\r\norder  is threatened by such activities.  It may be right  in\r\n\r\nsuch  situations to expect licensing.  But there must be many\r\n\r\nother  situations where we should be able to enjoy the public\r\n\r\nperformances of our multi-talented population and others with\r\n\r\na minimum of red tape.  The need for the Public Entertainment\r\n\r\nLicensing Unit to take a balanced view is critical and I hope\r\n\r\nthat   the  new  measures  will  not  be  a  step  back  from\r\n\r\ncultivating   a  vibrant  art  and  culture  environment   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me\r\n\r\nthank all the speakers for speaking on the Bill and thank all\r\n\r\nthe  other speakers, except Mr Jeyaretnam, for supporting the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the speakers have caught the spirit behind these\r\n\r\namendments.    PELU  does  not  stand  still.    The   Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments Act does not stand still.  It  has  been  fine\r\n\r\ntuning its regime over the last few years.  For example, some\r\n\r\nMembers  who  know will realise that now for  rock  concerts,\r\n\r\ndancing   is   permitted  provided  safety   conditions   are\r\n\r\nsatisfied.  Also, in some of these pubs where jazz  music  is\r\n\r\nplayed,  if  the space is appropriate and if the operator  is\r\n\r\nconfident  that  there  will be no law  and  order  problems,\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  audience can also join  in.   Indeed,  over\r\n\r\ntime,  not  so  much in a major way, certain activities  have\r\n\r\nbeen exempted from the Act, for example, films that are shown\r\n\r\nin cinemas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big exercise because the time is ripe to look\r\n\r\nat how the Act can be further amended to make regulation even\r\n\r\nlighter,  a lighter touch to regulation.  One approach  will,\r\n\r\nof  course, be class exemptions.  Mr Goh Choon Kang has asked\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not getai will also be exempted.  Indeed,  getai\r\n\r\nwill be exempted from the Public Entertainments Act.  Already\r\n\r\nthis  year  a lighter touch was used to regulate the  Seventh\r\n\r\nMonth Festival where there were exemptions given\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder the Miscellaneous Offences Act for auctions.  But if we\r\n\r\ndo this for auctions and do not do that for getai, there will\r\n\r\nbe  anomaly.   For  this year, public entertainment  licences\r\n\r\nwere still required for getai.  But under the class exemption\r\n\r\napproach, public entertainment licences will not be required.\r\n\r\nSo Seventh Month Festival operators will know that there is a\r\n\r\nregime  here where there is no need for exemptions  but  they\r\n\r\nwill  have to satisfy certain conditions, which is fair.   As\r\n\r\nlong  as  they satisfy those conditions, they will be allowed\r\n\r\nto organise their functions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One condition would be for them to notify police at\r\n\r\nleast  seven days in advance of the event.  This  is  not  to\r\n\r\nhinder  them or to put a blanket on their activities.  It  is\r\n\r\ngood  for police to know where some of these getais  will  be\r\n\r\noperating  because in the Seventh Month Festival period  many\r\n\r\nwill  be  performed all over Singapore.  So Police will  have\r\n\r\npre-knowledge of where possible problems may  arise.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot  that they will arise but it is good for the local police\r\n\r\ndivision to know that.  That is something which I am sure all\r\n\r\nSeventh  Month Festival operators will be very  happy  about.\r\n\r\nThis  year's event went off well despite the fact  that  many\r\n\r\npeople  had  to  adjust, including the operators,  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders and so forth.  When we take this approach, it will be\r\n\r\na win-win situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point is the scope of the Bill. Here\r\n\r\nagain,  these amendments signify the fact that the  Ministry,\r\n\r\nPolice  and  PELU know that the Act cannot be  over-reaching.\r\n\r\nAs  Members  read in the amendments, certain categories  have\r\n\r\nbeen  removed  from  the ambit of the Act,  events  that  are\r\n\r\nalready covered in other Acts like fireworks display and also\r\n\r\nevents  that do not pose law and order problems.  This  shows\r\n\r\nan active mindset on the part of the Ministry, the police and\r\n\r\nPELU  to  see which activity can be taken out.  Indeed,  with\r\n\r\nclass exemption, even more activities will be taken out.  But\r\n\r\nthe question then arises: can more be taken out?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point has been made by many speakers whether or not\r\n\r\ntalks and meetings should be regulated, in particular\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindoor  talks and meetings.  Mr Jeyaretnam may call  for  the\r\n\r\ntotal taking out of all talks and meetings.  But I think many\r\n\r\nMembers  in this House will agree that for outdoor  talks  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  it  is  very  important  to  have   the   public\r\n\r\nentertainment  licence because in outdoor settings,  law  and\r\n\r\norder problems can arise.  But does it therefore mean that in\r\n\r\nan  indoor setting there is no need to regulate these  talks?\r\n\r\nThe answer is no, because in multi-racial and multi-religious\r\n\r\nSingapore,  there is still a need to see what are  the  talks\r\n\r\nbeing  conducted on the ground, in particular talks that  may\r\n\r\nbe subversive or inflammatory in terms of race and religion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be also other topics, for example, one of the\r\n\r\nindoor  talks  that PELU rejected was a talk  on  picking  of\r\n\r\nlocks.  This was rejected in January 1999 because police felt\r\n\r\nthat this is not a very good topic.  It may attract all kinds\r\n\r\nof people who may want to learn how to pick locks.  We learn,\r\n\r\nfor  example, over the Internet how to make bombs.   That  is\r\n\r\ncoming  on  stream.  If we allow people just  to  give  talks\r\n\r\nwithout  some regulation in compact, multi-racial and  multi-religious  Singapore, that is not advisable.   But  the  real\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  has the regime hindered the giving  of  talks?\r\n\r\nHere  the  answer is a clear no, because PELU has  all  these\r\n\r\nyears administered the Act with a light touch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in 1999, out of about 6,000 applications\r\n\r\nprocessed,  only  64  applications, ie,  1%,  were  rejected.\r\n\r\nThese  were rejected for good reasons.  The point I  want  to\r\n\r\nmake  is  that some of these perceived hardships that  people\r\n\r\nvery  loosely  talk  about  do  not  exist.   In  fact,  even\r\n\r\nOpposition  party  members will know  that  though  they  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  apply for licences from PELU, these  have  been\r\n\r\nvery  freely  granted.  They have organised  many  talks  and\r\n\r\nforums.  If they apply in good time they are also approved in\r\n\r\ngood  time.   Indeed, the class exemption will  also  benefit\r\n\r\nOpposition  MPs  on the ground because in a  community  event\r\n\r\nsome  of  these activities like karaoke singing and so  forth\r\n\r\nwill now be exempted.  That is an important point to note.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act is not to catch targeted groups of people. Mr\r\n\r\nZulkifli  talks  about civil society groups.   Civil  society\r\n\r\ngroups  will,  if they put hand to heart, know that  the  Act\r\n\r\nalso  does not inhibit them.  Indeed, some will even say that\r\n\r\nover the last two or three years there has been a renaissance\r\n\r\nin  this area because many talks have been organised by  many\r\n\r\ncivil   society   groups  over  this   time,   including   Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam's  Open Singapore Centre.  The  Think  Centre  has\r\n\r\norganised  some  forums.  Other groups like the  Partner  for\r\n\r\nActive  Community  and the Working Group Committee  on  Civil\r\n\r\nSociety, and those Members who are in the societies will know\r\n\r\nthat  they have been able to secure licences for these talks.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no question that these amendments or PELU  or  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Entertainments  Act  inhibit  the  growth  of   civil\r\n\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fundamental point is this. Is the Act\r\n\r\nunconstitutional?  Mr Jeyaretnam makes a song and dance about\r\n\r\nit.   Again,  he makes no new points.  He repeats old  points\r\n\r\nand he does not make correct points.  Worse, he does not stay\r\n\r\nin  the House to listen to what is the correct position.   He\r\n\r\nis  not here.  As Mr Zulkifli,  a layman, points out, section\r\n\r\n14  does  not say that every Singaporean has a right to  free\r\n\r\nspeech  and he can say whatever he wants, wherever he  wants,\r\n\r\nwhenever  he  wants.  If that happens, what happens  in  some\r\n\r\nother  countries where there may be freer speech will  happen\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  The courts have in fact decided that the  Act\r\n\r\nis constitutional.  That is the main point.  This is really a\r\n\r\nred herring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the discretion that is exercised under the\r\n\r\nAct?   Mr  Jeyaretnam again makes a song and dance about  it.\r\n\r\nMr Zulkifli mentions it.  The Act does give discretion to the\r\n\r\nlicensing  officer.  But let us not forget that he  does  not\r\n\r\nact  alone.  He acts in consultation with relevant  agencies.\r\n\r\nFor example, he will consult, if it is an establishment of  a\r\n\r\npub,  the  local police division, and look at the suitability\r\n\r\nof  the site.  He will consult the NAC.  In fact, except only\r\n\r\nin  those rare cases where, for example, there may be  racial\r\n\r\nand religious\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsensitivities, NAC's views have prevailed.  That is what PELU\r\n\r\ntells me because NAC is, in fact, the body to advise on  arts\r\n\r\ntopics.   But  all  of  us would agree  here  that  in  those\r\n\r\ninstances    where    there   may   be   higher    overriding\r\n\r\nconsiderations,  as  happened in the  recent  Talaq  example,\r\n\r\nwhere  MUIS had come out with very strong objections  on  the\r\n\r\nperformance of the play, even with the conditions  that  were\r\n\r\nproposed by NAC, PELU ultimately decides.  It takes all these\r\n\r\nviews  into consideration.  It may accord greater  weight  to\r\n\r\nsome of these views. But ultimately it will decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suggestion has been made whether or not PELU is the\r\n\r\ncorrect  agency  to do this.  PELU currently  is  a  one-stop\r\n\r\nagency  for  all  these  activities.  Prof.  Chin  makes  the\r\n\r\nargument,  and  Mr Simon Tay makes a strong pitch,  that  the\r\n\r\narts  should  be treated differently because it  may  not  be\r\n\r\nstrictly  law and order.  There may be a need to balance  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  artistes to express themselves against  the  wider\r\n\r\npublic interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first say that there is reason for PELU to be\r\n\r\ninvolved because there could be law and order considerations.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  if  a  play does invoke racial  and  religious\r\n\r\nsensitivities and does agitate a community, it  may  lead  to\r\n\r\nunhappiness  in  the  community and  disharmony  in  society.\r\n\r\nHaving  said this, in the specific area of arts performances,\r\n\r\nthere  is  some  basis for a review to be done  by  PELU   on\r\n\r\nwhether  it  should be the one-stop agency.   Let  me  assure\r\n\r\nMembers that the point is taken and PELU will do a review and\r\n\r\nMHA  will  consult  MITA  on what is the  best  position  for\r\n\r\nSingapore, taking into consideration the development  of  the\r\n\r\narts and also the need to preserve public interest and public\r\n\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the licensing officer's discretion. He does not\r\n\r\nexercise  discretion in vacuo.  Because if you  look  at  the\r\n\r\nAct,  section  14  states  the broad  grounds  on  which  his\r\n\r\ndiscretion will be exercised, whether it may lead to a breach\r\n\r\nof peace, whether it may be offensive, immoral or subversive,\r\n\r\nor whether it would lead to any injury.  So\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  are  the broad factors.  Within this framework,  there\r\n\r\nare  also specific factors, both for ad hoc licences and  for\r\n\r\nestablishment licences.  Indeed, Mr Simon Tay  has  raised  a\r\n\r\nparliamentary  question on this, asking  what  these  factors\r\n\r\nare,  and we have replied.  So it is no secret.  For example,\r\n\r\nPELU  will look at the suitability of the applicant,  whether\r\n\r\nhe   has  got  an  adverse  record,  and  also  look  at  the\r\n\r\nsuitability of the place.  If it is an establishment licence,\r\n\r\nis  it in a residential area?  PELU will look at what is  the\r\n\r\nnature  of  the entertainment being provided.  So  these  are\r\n\r\nsome of the factors PELU will look at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say that in practice, especially for\r\n\r\nestablishment licences, when there is this to-ing and fro-ing\r\n\r\nbetween  PELU  and  the  applicant,  and  ultimately  if  the\r\n\r\napplication is turned down, he will have a sense  as  to  why\r\n\r\nhis application has been turned down.  And indeed, if he does\r\n\r\nnot, he can ask for reasons. Mr Zulkifli makes a point -  why\r\n\r\nnot PELU give the reasons upfront.  So let me assure him that\r\n\r\nPELU has nothing to hide.  The Act provides for the applicant\r\n\r\nto  ask for reasons within seven days and when he does  that,\r\n\r\nreasons  are given, after which he has 14 days to  appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister.  So even though the licensing officer does have\r\n\r\na  discretion, ultimately should there be a rejection and  an\r\n\r\nappeal,  it  is  the  Minister,  a  representative   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, who will determine according to policies that are\r\n\r\nlaid  down,  in  particular public interest,  public  safety,\r\n\r\npublic order, whether or not the event should go ahead.   And\r\n\r\nI  think  that  is  constitutional  and  proper  because  the\r\n\r\nMinister is an elected representative and he has to  bear  in\r\n\r\nmind  all  these  wide considerations.  If the  appellant  is\r\n\r\nstill  unhappy, he can go to court.  He can ask for  judicial\r\n\r\nreview.  So the courts are always there.  Mr Jeyaretnam seems\r\n\r\nto  allude  that there is no recourse to court.   He  is  not\r\n\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung makes this point about the demerit\r\n\r\nscheme  which I think Mr Zulkifli also makes.  Let me  assure\r\n\r\nthe  Members that this scheme is not something to  catch  the\r\n\r\napplicants or make it more difficult for them to comply\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  conditions.  You must understand this  scheme  and  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  the Bill, which is to liberalise it,  which  will\r\n\r\nmake  punishment  more  transparent, more  certain  and  more\r\n\r\ngraduated.  This demerit scheme only applies to establishment\r\n\r\nlicences, not ad hoc licences.  So there is nothing  to  fear\r\n\r\nthat   with  a  demerit  system,  ad  hoc  applications   for\r\n\r\nperformance  of  the  arts  or  meetings  or  talks  will  be\r\n\r\naffected.   The scheme cannot fit into an ad hoc  mould,  but\r\n\r\nonly  for establishment licences, because there is a standing\r\n\r\nrelationship where the licence is granted for one  year,  two\r\n\r\nyears,  three years, and the person runs the pub.  And  there\r\n\r\nwill be conditions given to him when he is given a licence to\r\n\r\nrun  the  pub,  for  example, closing hours,  maintenance  of\r\n\r\nregister  of  employees, he must not employ  illegal  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  or  there must not be gambling or drug  taking.   So\r\n\r\nthese are conditions.  Some of the conditions, of course, are\r\n\r\nmore serious than others.  So not maintaining a register  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  so  serious.   So just like the  Driver  Improvement\r\n\r\nPoints Scheme (DIPS), all these will be set up, and then  the\r\n\r\npoints  will be allocated.  So he will know where  he  is  at\r\n\r\nthis  scale, and what he must not do.  Because he  will  then\r\n\r\nknow  that if he breaches these conditions, then this  number\r\n\r\nof  points will be added on and this penalty will then befall\r\n\r\nhim.   Even  in  terms of penalty, this demerit scheme  gives\r\n\r\nflexibility to PELU because new penalties will be added, like\r\n\r\nimposition  of a security deposit  -  that is a penalty  that\r\n\r\nwill  be  added  on this list  -  or curtailment  of  closing\r\n\r\nhours.   At  any  point in time along this  scale  should  he\r\n\r\ncommit an act whereby a certain penalty is attracted, he will\r\n\r\nbe  given notice.  Like I have said in my speech, he will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  notice  that  this action is  impending  and  then  to\r\n\r\nexplain to the Minister or to plead his case.  So that is the\r\n\r\nspirit behind the points scheme.  It should work well because\r\n\r\nit  would mean that people can operate their businesses  more\r\n\r\neffectively and more efficiently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked whether or not the Speakers' Corner\r\n\r\ncan  be extended in concept to indoor stadiums.  Again,  this\r\n\r\nis  not a new point.  I think he will know that.  But like  I\r\n\r\nhave said just now, there is no\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed to do that because if you have a talk inside a hotel  or\r\n\r\nother premises, you apply for a licence, you will get it.  It\r\n\r\nis  better  in fact not to restrict people to one venue.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  under  the present scheme, there are so  many  venues.\r\n\r\nYou want to have a talk inviting the public, you apply for  a\r\n\r\nlicence,  and the point, like I have said, is the  ease  with\r\n\r\nwhich applications are granted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked about the timeframe. Yes, in an\r\n\r\nearlier answer, we have said that for establishment licences,\r\n\r\nthe  current target is eight weeks; for ad hoc licences,  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  target is three weeks.  All these will  be  lowered.\r\n\r\nBecause  now  with the improvement in the  Act  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nadministration,  with less applications coming  to  the  PELU\r\n\r\nofficer,  these timings would be lowered.  So PELU will  work\r\n\r\ntowards lowering the timeframe taken for application.   I  am\r\n\r\nquite certain that with all these improvements, the time will\r\n\r\nindeed  be lowered.  So that is something that all applicants\r\n\r\ncan look forward to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think those are the main points that I have answered.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> May I have a clarification, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Chiam.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, regarding these ad hoc and\r\n\r\nestablishment licences, in the case of Potong Pasir, we  have\r\n\r\na  series of events throughout the year, can we apply for  an\r\n\r\nestablishment  licence in the sense that we get  one  licence\r\n\r\nfor the whole year's activities?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

So I think it is only fair to PELU, for  you  to\r\n\r\napply  when the event is more certain, and if it falls within\r\n\r\nthe  ambit of the Act, and now it has been relaxed, you  will\r\n\r\nget your licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I seek a point of clarification from\r\n\r\nthe Minister of State.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point of clarification is about the advisory\r\n\r\npanels.   The  Minister of State has said in his  reply  that\r\n\r\nthey  do listen to some other people, but we are not certain,\r\n\r\nit  is not predetermined who will be heard most.  What is his\r\n\r\nreply  to the suggestion about a fixed advisory panel on  the\r\n\r\nlines  of the Films Act and censorship of films?  Why  is  it\r\n\r\nany different?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point of clarification I seek from the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  is his reply on the  suggestion  for  an\r\n\r\nindoor  version of the Speakers' Corner.  His reply was  that\r\n\r\none  can apply for a licence anywhere, and therefore is  that\r\n\r\nnot  better.  But surely, Sir, does the Minister of State not\r\n\r\nrealise that the efficacy of a Speakers' Corner (Hong Lim) is\r\n\r\nthe  speed of the licensing process?  You go down there,  you\r\n\r\nget it within 15 minutes or half an hour, and that is the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame  idea that would distinguish an indoor Speakers'  Corner\r\n\r\nfrom  the `apply three weeks in advance you can speak in  any\r\n\r\nhotel' idea.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I will take Mr Simon Tay's\r\n\r\nfirst  point.   On  his  suggestion  for  a  panel  involving\r\n\r\ncitizens,  the  films model, when the review is  being  done,\r\n\r\nthis  can  be  considered, because if  MITA  takes  over  the\r\n\r\nfunction,  I am sure they will look at what model works.   On\r\n\r\nthe other point, let us look at the timeframe.  Currently, it\r\n\r\nis three weeks.  But, like I have said, PELU is determined to\r\n\r\nbring  it down.  So with the shorter timeframe, the time  lag\r\n\r\nthat Mr Simon Tay talks about will be less.  The other point,\r\n\r\nof  course,  is  whether  we want to  have  a  setting  of  a\r\n\r\nSpeakers'  Corner in an indoor setting with microphone,  with\r\n\r\npeople  in  close proximity and speaking whatever they  want.\r\n\r\nBecause  for a Speakers' Corner, as it is, as is well  known,\r\n\r\neven the topic is not known.  So in an open setting where  it\r\n\r\nis  visible,  where  you  do  not  use  the  microphone,  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  law  and order problem arising  is  reduced,\r\n\r\nwhich  experience  has  borne  out.   I  think  it  is  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent in an indoor setting with a microphone where  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  more  heckling, people are in close proximity,  and\r\n\r\nadherents   of  different  opinions  will  then  jostle   for\r\n\r\nattention and who knows, fisticuffs may take place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think the system now is a better approach. Let us\r\n\r\nleave  it  at that where if there are indoor talks where  the\r\n\r\npublic  is  invited, tell us what the topic is, and  if  PELU\r\n\r\nsees  that  the  application deserves approval,  it  will  be\r\n\r\napproved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> I understand that the Act\r\n\r\nexempts activities organised by grassroots organisations like\r\n\r\nthe  PA.   Would the Minister of State consider  also  giving\r\n\r\nexemption  to  community activities organised  by  Opposition\r\n\r\nMPs,  like Mr Chiam has just raised, activities organised  by\r\n\r\nthe   Town   Council,   or   activities   organised   by   my\r\n\r\nconstituency's committees?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, for the community events\r\n\r\nwhich involve magic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshows, puppet shows, karaoke, under the class exemption, they\r\n\r\nwill already be exempted.  But the talks, I think, is another\r\n\r\nmatter.  Not that we want to restrict your desire to speak to\r\n\r\nyour residents.  The reason is because the relaxation  -   in\r\n\r\nfact  this was a relaxation announced in Parliament  just  at\r\n\r\nthe  last sitting  -  is so that the elected MP can speak  to\r\n\r\nresidents  of  his  own  ward  in  an  outdoor  constituency,\r\n\r\ncommunity  setting.  Right now, it will  be  up  to  PELU  to\r\n\r\ndecide,  based on the facts of the case whether or  not  this\r\n\r\nrequirement has been satisfied.  So I think it is better  for\r\n\r\nPELU to make a decision, because if you think that, yes, this\r\n\r\nis  a constituency community setting, so you fall within  the\r\n\r\nAct,  and you organise it, and lo and behold, 800 people turn\r\n\r\nup,  half of whom are from outside the constituency, then you\r\n\r\nwill  be  caught by the Act.  So let us not go  through  that\r\n\r\ntrouble.  I think Mr Chiam's experience has shown that if you\r\n\r\napply,  PELU looks at it objectively, if it falls within  the\r\n\r\nambit  of the relaxation, the licence will be given  in  good\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will allow one last clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> The Minister of State in his\r\n\r\nclarification earlier has mentioned a review.

However, the MC may,\r\n\r\nunder   a  resolution,  decide  on  how  to  discharge   this\r\n\r\nresponsibility. For example, they can pass a by-law  to  make\r\n\r\nthe  owners  responsible for cleaning the  windows  in  their\r\n\r\nunits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, owners have sometimes taken it upon\r\n\r\nthemselves to clean the external windows when they are dirty,\r\n\r\nsince  they have the access from inside their flats. The  MCs\r\n\r\nmay have difficulty stopping the owners from doing so.\r\n\r\nAlthough  there are some domestic workers who have fallen  to\r\n\r\ntheir deaths from heights, the number is small in relation to\r\n\r\nthe  population of more than 100,000 domestic workers working\r\n\r\nin Singapore. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is\r\n\r\nvery concerned with the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons why domestic workers fall from\r\n\r\nheights. Hence, it is not possible to solve the problem using\r\n\r\nany single solution. MOM has adopted a multi-pronged approach\r\n\r\nin dealing with the issue. It has mounted several initiatives\r\n\r\nto educate both employers and their domestic workers on the\r\n\r\nimportance of safety at work in the home environment. These\r\n\r\ninclude producing an information kit for the employers, an\r\n\r\norientation video for the workers and the recently launched\r\n\r\n\"Handy Guide for Foreign Domestic Workers\". MOM will be\r\n\r\ncoming out with new programmes to enhance the level of\r\n\r\nprofessionalism of employment agents in Singapore, including\r\n\r\na review of our existing regulatory framework. It has also\r\n\r\nworked with CDCs to help organize safety courses for domestic\r\n\r\nworkers. In this regard MOM will continue to work with\r\n\r\ncommunity and non-governmental organizations to conduct\r\n\r\nsafety courses for domestic workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who are criminally negligent in unnecessarily\r\n\r\nexposing their domestic workers to work hazards will be\r\n\r\nprosecuted under the Penal Code.

This\r\n\r\nresponsibility cannot be passed on to a third party including\r\n\r\nthe Government.
