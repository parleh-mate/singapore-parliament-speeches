Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I think all yesterday the Opposition was\r\n\r\ngiving  every  possible reason why they boycotted  the\r\n\r\nNational Day and National Loyalty Week rallies, except\r\n\r\nthe right one. They know what the real reason was, and\r\n\r\nI  think  they know that I know what the  real  reason\r\n\r\nwas.  But  unless it is their desire  to  prolong  the\r\n\r\ndebate  on the subject, I will just confine myself  to\r\n\r\nclarifying one or two points raised yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One accusation was that the National Day rally was a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. show. Sir, if by that is meant that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nas a Party was very prominent in the celebrations, let\r\n\r\nme  just give an indication of some of the items  that\r\n\r\nwere  scheduled  to  take place during  National  Day.\r\n\r\nFirst,  I  think we started off with the National  Day\r\n\r\nrally which did not take place, and the Member for the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands flattered the Government by  blaming\r\n\r\nit  for not arranging the weather. We shall try to  do\r\n\r\nbetter  next  time. But that was the only occasion  on\r\n\r\nwhich P.A.P. members, as members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\nof a political Party, would have participated. And out\r\n\r\nof  the  20,000 people who would have participated  in\r\n\r\nthe rally, something like 3,500 would have been P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers.  Therefore, by no stretch of the  imagination\r\n\r\ncould  that rally be described as a P.A.P. show.  That\r\n\r\nwas  followed  immediately  by  the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nreception   to  political,  civic,  trade  union   and\r\n\r\ncultural representatives. Surely, Sir, that could  not\r\n\r\nbe  described  as a P.A.P. show. Then  there  was  the\r\n\r\nNational  Economic Development Fair sponsored  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  Trades  Union  Congress,   and   the\r\n\r\nChambers  of  Commerce. Was that a P.A.P. show?  Then\r\n\r\nthere  were three open-air concerts. At none of  these\r\n\r\nwas  the P.A.P. represented, nor did the P.A.P. as  a\r\n\r\npolitical Party take an active part. Then there was an\r\n\r\nArt  exhibition; again organised not by the P.A.P. but\r\n\r\nby  local  artists. Then there was a fun-fair  at  the\r\n\r\nRaffles  Institution, organised by the T.U.C. and  not\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P. There were a number of sports  events,\r\n\r\nagain  organised by sports organisations. There was  a\r\n\r\nmass   tatoo  organised  by  schools.  So,  Sir,  this\r\n\r\nallegation that the National Day celebrations  were  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. show has no shred of truth to it.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  the  only  occasion was  when  during  National\r\n\r\nLoyalty  Week P.A.P. members participated in the  mass\r\n\r\nrally,  there  were something like 30 to 40  different\r\n\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other contention by the Member for the Southern\r\n\r\nIslands  was  that the Opposition was  not  consulted.\r\n\r\nWhat  he really meant was not that the Opposition  was\r\n\r\nnot    consulted   but   that   something   like    40\r\n\r\nrepresentatives who were there did not take the advice\r\n\r\nof  representatives of the S.P.A. and  U.M.N.O.  Their\r\n\r\nadvice  was  that  no political Party  should  display\r\n\r\nflags  or  banners.  That was the point  of  view  put\r\n\r\nforward,  and everyone else except the representatives\r\n\r\nof  these two political Parties saw no objection.  The\r\n\r\nS.P.A.,  U.M.N.O. representatives, walked out  of  the\r\n\r\nmeeting. In fact, we did not know that they walked out\r\n\r\nof  the  meeting. All we saw were three people quietly\r\n\r\nwalking out, and then on the following day there was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  news report claiming that the members concerned had\r\n\r\nstaged  a walkout. We were not interested in making  a\r\n\r\npolitical issue out of National Day celebrations.  So,\r\n\r\njust  as on the first occasion during National Loyalty\r\n\r\nWeek  when they themselves announced in the newspapers\r\n\r\nthat   they  had  staged  a  boycott,  all  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  did was to express regret that  they  were\r\n\r\nnot  able  to  participate, and we would not  make  an\r\n\r\nissue out of it. On the second occasion - that was  last\r\n\r\nyear - they issued a statement to the Press saying  that\r\n\r\nthis was a P.A.P. show; the Minister was unreasonable;\r\n\r\nthey  were not consulted; they were presented  with  a\r\n\r\nset schedule, and they were asked to accept or not  to\r\n\r\naccept  it.  That  is  not  quite  true,  because  the\r\n\r\ndiscussion  at the first meeting - there were  about  40\r\n\r\nother organisations there - started from April and  went\r\n\r\non  till  the  end of May. Many suggestions  were  put\r\n\r\nforward by the other organisations. Some were accepted\r\n\r\nby  the  Government, and some were scrapped.  But  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. representatives    and     the     U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nrepresentatives decided to pull out  and  to  make  an\r\n\r\nissue  out of the whole thing. Again we refused to  be\r\n\r\ndrawn into making an issue out of it. All that we  did\r\n\r\nwas  to  have  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  issue  a\r\n\r\nstatement,  again  expressing  regret  that  the  two\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties  could  not  participate  in  these\r\n\r\ncelebrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main contention is not that political\r\n\r\nParties   should  not  participate  in  National   Day\r\n\r\ncelebrations - that they concede - but what  they  say  is\r\n\r\nthat  if  political Parties participate,  they  should\r\n\r\nconceal  their identity. They say you must not display\r\n\r\na  flag or a banner. In fact, yesterday the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park said that if a political Party  displayed\r\n\r\nits flag or banner, the Head of State would be put  in\r\n\r\nthe  invidious  position of having to salute  a  Party\r\n\r\nflag. Sir, I am quite sure the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nput  that forward purely as an argument. The Yang \r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara did not salute the P.A.P. flag any more\r\n\r\nthan  he  saluted the flags that were carried  by  the\r\n\r\nChinese Chamber of Commerce, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore   Dance   Hostesses  Association   and   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Trishaw Riders Association. He  did  salute\r\n\r\nthem,  but  he  was not saluting their flags!  He  was\r\n\r\nacknowledging the respect that was being  accorded  to\r\n\r\nhim  as  the  Head  of State on that  day  by  various\r\n\r\nsections of the population. So the Opposition concede,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  that every other organisation  can  display\r\n\r\ntheir  flag,  can show their identity.  But  for  some\r\n\r\nobscure  reason,  they say that if  political  Parties\r\n\r\ndisplay their identities, they are going to create  an\r\n\r\nimpression  among  the people that  they  are  putting\r\n\r\nforward,  on the day of national unity, symbols  which\r\n\r\nemphasise differences. If that is so, Sir, the  others\r\n\r\nalso  emphasised differences - the Chambers of  Commerce\r\n\r\nshowed  there were three Chambers of Commerce in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  The  schools went one by  one,  showing  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  schools - Malay schools,  Chinese  schools,\r\n\r\nEnglish  schools. Could we not apply the same argument\r\n\r\nand say that on that day the schools which used to  be\r\n\r\nunder  the care of the Member for Tanglin should  have\r\n\r\ngot  mixed  up  with Chung Cheng High School  or  some\r\n\r\nother school?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, I think, they really object to is not that the\r\n\r\npolitical Parties should not display symbols.  We  are\r\n\r\nnot  ashamed,  Sir,  of our Party symbol,  or  of  the\r\n\r\nhundreds  of thousands of people who have  helped  the\r\n\r\nParty  to  realise its ideals and who are  responsible\r\n\r\nfor  our being here. We are not, ashamed of all  these\r\n\r\npeople. Therefore, we were not going to insult them on\r\n\r\nthat day by saying, \"You can participate in this rally\r\n\r\nonly  on condition that you disguise yourself as sheep\r\n\r\nor  goats.\"  We said, \"No. You are P.A.P. members  and\r\n\r\nyou  should  be proud of the fact.\" I think  what  the\r\n\r\nOpposition really wanted was to have an anonymous body\r\n\r\nof  political  organisations so  that  P.A.P. members\r\n\r\nmight  be  mistaken for S.P.A., and U.M.N.O. members,\r\n\r\nwhich  is not fair to the P.A.P. members. And U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nand  S.P.A. members  might  be  mistaken  for  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers, which again, I say, is not fair\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  their  supporters  who obviously  believe  in  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. and  U.M.N.O.  Therefore,  Sir,   all   these\r\n\r\narguments do not count for anything. The real  reason,\r\n\r\nas  I  have  said,  is that all they  wanted  was  one\r\n\r\nanonymous  group  of political parties  so  that  they\r\n\r\ncould  probably  claim that there  were  fewer  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers  than  there  really were;  and,  secondly,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  all  the protests may be part of  the  general\r\n\r\nstrategy of the Opposition parties to show that things\r\n\r\nare  getting from bad to worse and that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  achieved  nothing. A National Day celebration  as\r\n\r\neverybody  acknowledges has had some  impact,  and  to\r\n\r\nthat  extent, they have been trying to pour cold water\r\n\r\non  an occasion which at least we have hoped would  be\r\n\r\nfree  of  political  controversy and  political  party\r\n\r\nsquabbles. But, unfortunately, they have seen  fit  to\r\n\r\nbring  that occasion into disrepute by alleging, quite\r\n\r\nfalsely,  that  it  is  a  P.A.P. show,  that  it  is\r\n\r\norganised  by  P.A.P. members,  and  that  it  is  an\r\n\r\noccasion  to put forward P.A.P propaganda. As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  out of all the celebrations, the only  occasion\r\n\r\nwhen  the  P.A.P. got  some prominence  was  when  it\r\n\r\nmarched  as one of the 20,000 people who marched  past\r\n\r\nthe Head of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture has just explained at great length the details\r\n\r\nconcerning the National Day celebrations in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe   do  not  question  the  detailed  aspect  of  the\r\n\r\ncelebrations.  What  we are questioning  here  is  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  or  the manner in which the Government  had\r\n\r\norganised such a National Day celebration. We  are  of\r\n\r\nthe  opinion that the organisation did not aim at  the\r\n\r\nideals  which were intended originally. If we were  to\r\n\r\ncomment  item  by  item  on the programme  during  the\r\n\r\nNational  Day celebrations, it would take  us  a  long\r\n\r\ntime  to  do it. But I would like to quote an instance\r\n\r\nwhere  the  people in the celebrations were forced  to\r\n\r\nparticipate.  They did not participate  of  their  own\r\n\r\nfree will but because of forced circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had no alternative but to participate, because of\r\n\r\ntheir    position,   their   livelihood,   and   their\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  Pressure was  put  upon  them  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and they were thus obliged to take part in\r\n\r\nthe celebrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, for instance, the Chambers of Commerce. National Day could be considered to be a day of pride\r\n\r\nfor  the  State of Singapore. As regards the  response\r\n\r\ngiven by the businessmen, we observed that only a  few\r\n\r\nof the commercial buildings put up bunting in the real\r\n\r\nsense  of the word. We saw the bunting put up  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It costs $42,000, and was spoilt  by  the\r\n\r\nrain on that day. If on that day we were able to get a\r\n\r\nresponse from every section of the community and  each\r\n\r\nand every citizen did his bit to make the celebrations\r\n\r\na   success,  it  was  because  they  were  forced  to\r\n\r\nparticipate;  there was no expression of sincerity  in\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another point. This concerns the\r\n\r\nresidents  of the Southern Islands who were  requested\r\n\r\nto  participate in the sea sports during the  National\r\n\r\nDay  celebrations. They were forced to participate  in\r\n\r\nthe kolek race, and they were housed at the Telok Ayer\r\n\r\nbasin.  They were given accommodation and food and  so\r\n\r\non.   These  islanders  were  dissatisfied  with   the\r\n\r\nfacilities accorded to them, because, apart  from  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  they had to leave their homes for  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  days - at least they had to leave their  kampongs\r\n\r\nfor  two  days -  they  had  to  row  their  koleks  to\r\n\r\nSingapore and return empty-handed. Normally,  if  they\r\n\r\nwere required to participate in an important event  on\r\n\r\nan  auspicious  occasion such as this, they  would  be\r\n\r\ngiven  allowances, and transport facilities  would  be\r\n\r\nprovided  for  them to arrive at Singapore,  and  they\r\n\r\nwould  not  be asked to row their own boats  from  the\r\n\r\nislands to Singapore. This was a mistake which I could\r\n\r\nquote  on  how  the organisers organised according  to\r\n\r\ntheir whims, without caring to hear the views of  the\r\n\r\nother sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meetings organised to run the National Day\r\n\r\ncelebrations   were  ready-made,  and  the   committee\r\n\r\nmembers were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven  all the resolutions to adopt, and there was  no\r\n\r\nchance  for them to put up their views. What we submit\r\n\r\nis   that   all  sections  should  organise   such   a\r\n\r\ncelebration so that we could really participate in it,\r\n\r\nas  was organised by the previous Government. That is,\r\n\r\nit  should  be  by  way  of  forming  a  sub-committee\r\n\r\ncomprising representatives from all political  Parties\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, and not like the organisation conducted\r\n\r\nor run by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I would like to draw the\r\n\r\nattention  of the Member for the Southern  Islands  to\r\n\r\nthe residents of the Southern Islands who participated\r\n\r\nin  the  National Day celebrations. As far as I  know,\r\n\r\nthe  islanders were provided with more than what  they\r\n\r\nnormally received. It is a fact that the people of the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands had participated in the kolek  race,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, like the ones held at Ayer Gumuroh  and\r\n\r\nSiglap. They voluntarily came without their having  to\r\n\r\nbe  provided  with food and so on.  It  has  become  a\r\n\r\ncustom to them. Not only in Singapore but also, to the\r\n\r\nbest  of my knowledge, quite recently when celebrating\r\n\r\nthe birthday of the Sultan of Johore, the residents of\r\n\r\nthe Southern Islands left their homes for a week or so\r\n\r\nand  went to take part in the kolek race. However,  in\r\n\r\nlast year's National Day celebrations, we invited them\r\n\r\nto  take  part  in the kolek race and  they  willingly\r\n\r\nagreed   to   participate.  We  gave  them   lodgings,\r\n\r\naccommodation,  apart from the prizes awarded  to  the\r\n\r\nwinners.  I am quite sure that the islanders were  not\r\n\r\nforced  to  take part. On the contrary, they  gave  of\r\n\r\ntheir  best  during the National Day  celebrations,  a\r\n\r\nthing  which  has  become part  and  parcel  of  their\r\n\r\neveryday  lives. For instance, during the  New  Year's\r\n\r\nkolek  race, we see the islanders taking part.  I  can\r\n\r\nsay that I am very close with the islanders there, and\r\n\r\nso  far  I have not received any complaints from  them\r\n\r\nabout their participation in last year's National  Day\r\n\r\ncelebrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Because   U.M.N.O. has   been   repeatedly\r\n\r\nmentioned, I would like to stress U.M.N.O.'s attitude.\r\n\r\nWe  agreed,  in principle, to celebrate National  Day,\r\n\r\nbut what we could not accept were the things that were\r\n\r\ndone  and  which had been explained by the Member  for\r\n\r\nthe Southern Islands and to which objection was taken.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  I  am  one of the representatives  from\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.  We received an invitation from the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture.  It is imperative that I receive  further\r\n\r\nclarification,  because  I  know  that  when  we  were\r\n\r\ninvited  by  the Ministry of Culture, we  replied  and\r\n\r\naccepted the invitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we were present at the meeting. But, again\r\n\r\nI   shall  require  a  further  explanation  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture, because it appears that at  that\r\n\r\nparticular meeting which was fixed by the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture, no mention whatsoever was made in the  agenda\r\n\r\nregarding  the  matters  to  be  raised  for   further\r\n\r\ndiscussion and reconsideration by our side. But  since\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Culture has accused us of  this  and\r\n\r\nthat, I would like to ask him if that is the manner in\r\n\r\nwhich  a  meeting,  especially of  political  parties,\r\n\r\nshould be conducted. I feel that that is nothing short\r\n\r\nof  steamrollering the issue. If everything is  to  be\r\n\r\nforced  on  us,  U.M.N.O., so that  we  will  have  no\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  submit our views,  then  I  think  no\r\n\r\nuseful purpose can be served by throwing allegations\r\n\r\nat us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point, Mr Speaker, which I would\r\n\r\nlike  to explain to this House. I wish to congratulate\r\n\r\nand  pay  my  tribute to the Prime  Minister  of  this\r\n\r\nState.  I  knew how difficult it was when we tried  to\r\n\r\ndraw  up  a  national flag. Meeting after meeting  was\r\n\r\nheld, but he was prepared to reconsider and accept our\r\n\r\nviews  and  findings. Why is it that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture could not adopt the same attitude? I therefore\r\n\r\nrequire an explanation from the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we, the Opposition\r\n\r\nParties on this side of the House, still believe  that\r\n\r\npolitical  parties as such should not  participate  in\r\n\r\nNational  Day  celebrations. My  suggestion  yesterday\r\n\r\nevening   was  merely  a  concession  to  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  that  if  they felt  it  was  vital  that\r\n\r\npolitical  parties should participate, then  we  would\r\n\r\nconcede  the  point  to them; but  we  asked  them  to\r\n\r\nconcede  a  point to us, that the flags  be  dispensed\r\n\r\nwith.  So  far as we are concerned, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis occasion is as important as the national flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has said what, in\r\n\r\nfact,  did  take place when the State was  considering\r\n\r\nthe question of a national flag. On that occasion, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the political parties concerned were invited.\r\n\r\nThere was a vast difference between the nature of  the\r\n\r\nfirst flag which was presented at that meeting and the\r\n\r\nflag  that we have today as the flag of the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  A  big  difference,  which  on  the  first\r\n\r\noccasion  seemed to us to be unbridgeable.  But  after\r\n\r\nthree  or  four  days  of  coming  and  going,  likely\r\n\r\nbreakdowns,  almost certain breakdowns, we  eventually\r\n\r\ngot a solution. The reason, Mr Speaker, was that both\r\n\r\nsides wanted a solution; and thank God, a solution was\r\n\r\nfound.  Because if the Government had  gone  ahead  as\r\n\r\nthey had originally intended, we would not have had  a\r\n\r\nnational  flag  and  the  flag  would  have  become  a\r\n\r\npolitical  issue. If the Government had not been  able\r\n\r\nto seek the agreement of the political parties on this\r\n\r\nside, Mr Speaker, Sir, our intention was to make this\r\n\r\na  political issue in the forthcoming elections. But I\r\n\r\nam  sure the Government is glad, and we also are glad,\r\n\r\nthat  that is not a political issue today. All  of  us\r\n\r\nare  100 per cent behind the flag. It is our flag.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  the Government's flag, the P.A.P.'s flag  the\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.'s flag, or the S.P.A.'s flag, but the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's flag. If that is the correct  attitude\r\n\r\nto adopt on a national matter such as this, why is the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture  being  so  adamant  about  the\r\n\r\nNational  Day  celebration? We think the National  Day\r\n\r\ncelebration is just as important as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnational  flag.

Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  notice\r\n\r\nthat the figure does not appear in the 1960 Estimates.\r\n\r\nIt  appears to be a new item of expenditure  which  is\r\n\r\nbeing  incurred by the Government. Could  we  have  an\r\n\r\nexplanation why this was found to be necessary?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir. Caldecott Hill Estate is a\r\n\r\nprivate residential estate belonging to the Estate  of\r\n\r\nthe  late Mr Mistri. Radio Singapore is sited on land\r\n\r\nin  this  estate  purchased from  the  Estate  of  Mr\r\n\r\nMistri. By virtue of an indenture of conveyance  dated\r\n\r\n25th   June,  1960,  the  Government  is   liable   to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  the maintenance of the  estate  roads,\r\n\r\nsite cables and septic tank. There was no provision in\r\n\r\nthe  1960  Estimates,  because  there  was  then  some\r\n\r\ndiscussion  as to whether the indenture of  conveyance\r\n\r\nmight not be abrogated. However, agreement was reached\r\n\r\nwith  the  Trustees of the Estate that the  Government\r\n\r\npays one-third contribution towards the maintenance of\r\n\r\nthe estate. $808,000 is the estimated amount based  on\r\n\r\nwhat  it  has  cost in the past The total  expenditure\r\n\r\nfrom  1st January, 1953, to 30th September, 1959,  was\r\n\r\nabout  $53,000.

The Minister intends  to\r\n\r\nrun this orchestra in the next year for $75,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are orchestras and\r\n\r\norchestras. You could have an orchestra of three, five\r\n\r\nor  eight, or you could have an orchestra of more. You\r\n\r\ncould  also have a symphony orchestra. Each  of  these\r\n\r\norchestras costs different amounts, depending  on  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  persons  in  the orchestra.  But  when  an\r\n\r\ninstitution such as Radio Singapore has an  orchestra,\r\n\r\nI  take  it  that it must be an orchestra which  comes\r\n\r\nvery  near - but not quite - to the symphony class  which\r\n\r\ncould  render pieces in various ranges of  music.  The\r\n\r\nvote  is  being reduced by more than half the  present\r\n\r\nvote.  Judging  from that, it would  appear  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber in the orchestra\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  going  to  be reduced by more than  half.

But if he will look at them,  he  will\r\n\r\nsee  an  entry  of  $75,000  for  1961  as  against  a\r\n\r\nprovision of $166,800 for 1960. That can give a  wrong\r\n\r\npicture of what is happening in Radio Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current sum of $166,800 covers not only the\r\n\r\nsalaries  of members of the radio orchestra  but  also\r\n\r\nthe fees paid to augmentees who are employed from time\r\n\r\nto  time  to  complete  the instruments  required  for\r\n\r\ncertain  types  of  music to be played  by  the  Radio\r\n\r\nOrchestra,  it  also  covers  fees  paid   for   music\r\n\r\narrangements and orchestrations. The splitting of  the\r\n\r\nsum  of $166,800 into $75,000 for the salaries of  the\r\n\r\nRadio  Orchestra  and $72,000 as fees for  augmentees,\r\n\r\narrangements and orchestrations which appear under \r\n\r\nsub-head 30 of the Estimates, is really a move to make the\r\n\r\nadministration  of this vote simpler and  more\r\n\r\nclear-cut.  There  is no move to weaken the Radio  Orchestra\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been built over the years, and I  am  very\r\n\r\nglad,  Sir, to note that the Member for Farrer Park - at\r\n\r\nleast in this instance - is so interested in culture as\r\n\r\nto  listen to the Radio Orchestra, to express  concern\r\n\r\nthat  his Sunday and Friday music might be of a  lower\r\n\r\ntone  as  a  result  of reducing  the  number  in  the\r\n\r\nOrchestra.

The present Government - as  indeed  any\r\n\r\ngovernment - should be interested in art,  culture,  and\r\n\r\nso  on,  and  if the Government really means  what  it\r\n\r\nsays, that it is interested in fostering local art and\r\n\r\nlocal  artists,  I think there should  be  more  money\r\n\r\nallocated for this purpose by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Raffles Museum, there is a pottery section and\r\n\r\nthere   are  various  other  art  sections.  I   think\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  well  placed to collect  these  things,\r\n\r\nbecause  this  is the focal point for distribution  to\r\n\r\nvarious  parts  of South-East Asia  and  there  are  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  useful  works of art which  I  think  the\r\n\r\nmuseum  might  purchase.  The Government  could  focus\r\n\r\nattention on these various aspects of art, and I think\r\n\r\nthe sum of $1,750 is not enough even to purchase three\r\n\r\nor four pieces of any value at all. So I would ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  in  future  they  might  give   this\r\n\r\nparticular aspect of Raffles Museum more consideration\r\n\r\nin the way of financial allotments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> When I visit the museums of other\r\n\r\ncountries,  I  find  that I  always  have  to  pay  an\r\n\r\nentrance  fee,  but in the case of the Raffles  Museum\r\n\r\neveryone  can  go there gratis.

In fact, I am\r\n\r\nafraid,  Sir, that he is just repeating what  he  read\r\n\r\nfrom  a  letter in the Straits Times. When that letter\r\n\r\nappeared,  I  did  ring  up Radio  Singapore  and  ask\r\n\r\nwhether  by  some  unfortunate  accident - they  had   a\r\n\r\nprogramme,  I  understand,  where  the  \"jockey\" \r\n\r\n(so-called)   would  just  snatch  any  record  from   the\r\n\r\nrack-rock  `n roll music did get in. They  assured  me\r\n\r\nthat  no  rock `n roll music is on the racks. I  think\r\n\r\nthere is a difference between rock `n roll, as defined\r\n\r\nby  musicians,  and rock `n roll, as  defined  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill for the purposes of this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, might I come back to my point:\r\n\r\nwhether the Minister finds commercial services equally\r\n\r\nprofitable from a cultural point of view?

The  Government  are\r\n\r\nembarked  on a cultural programme. They want  to  give\r\n\r\nculture in Singapore a particular direction. They want\r\n\r\nto  give it a particular content. What is in the  mind\r\n\r\nof  the Minister and what direction he wishes to give,\r\n\r\nonly he himself can say. But we are very interested in\r\n\r\nthe  content and the direction.

And that  is\r\n\r\none   of  the  reasons  why  we  are  starting   Suara\r\n\r\nSingapura,  which we discussed earlier, to preserve  a\r\n\r\nbalance  between  serious and  popular  entertainment,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not  necessarily the kind of  entertainment\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member  for Cairnhill is thinking  of,  but\r\n\r\ngood, clean, healthy popular entertainment. To balance\r\n\r\nthat,  we have decided to launch Suara Singapura which\r\n\r\nwill  give more substantial programmes for those  like\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Cairnhill who would like to listen  to\r\n\r\nsymphony orchestras. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I do wish the Minister would take\r\n\r\nthis a little bit more seriously, because I can assure\r\n\r\nhim  that parents outside are seriously interested  in\r\n\r\nthis  topic.  This is not a game of shuttle  where  we\r\n\r\npass the shuttle from this side to that side, and from\r\n\r\nthat  side back to this side. And if the Minister went\r\n\r\ninto  the  matter,  he would find  that  most  of  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that  are  being  played  are   in   these\r\n\r\ncommercial  services,  and  the  children  insist   on\r\n\r\nlistening  to them. The question I am now  asking  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  this:  is  he satisfied,  from  his  own\r\n\r\ncultural  point  of view, or from the  point  of  view\r\n\r\nwhich he thinks the children should be exposed to,  if\r\n\r\nhe  wishes to expose them to certain types of culture,\r\n\r\nIs  this  the  type  of culture  that  he  wishes  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education schoolchildren to  be  exposed\r\n\r\nto - using his own phrase?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, Sir, I was not trying to treat\r\n\r\nthis matter in the lighthearted manner that the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park  thinks I am  doing.

Does he mean children's programmes, or does\r\n\r\nhe  mean programmes in general? By and large,  we  are\r\n\r\nquite  satisfied that the programmes are such as would\r\n\r\nbe  enjoyed by children, not necessarily by me  or  by\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Opposite  Benches,  but  these   are\r\n\r\nchildren's programmes which are popular in many  other\r\n\r\nparts  of  the world.

The  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Culture must realise that children do\r\n\r\nnot  listen to children's programmes alone. The  radio\r\n\r\nis  at  their disposal, and they tune in at  any  time\r\n\r\nthey like. The Minister for Education is not here.  If\r\n\r\nhe  is  here,  I am sure he will agree  with  me  that\r\n\r\neducation for children today does not mean learning to\r\n\r\nread  and  write in school alone. It means  everything\r\n\r\nthey  hear. The environment is so important - everything\r\n\r\nthey  hear, everything they see. The radio is a  means\r\n\r\nof  entertainment that penetrates the home willy-nilly\r\n\r\nthe parents' wishes. So it is up to the Government  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  what penetrates the home is good, not  only\r\n\r\nfor the adults but also that it is not detrimental  to\r\n\r\nthe  children.

All  these  vague  insinuations   that   the\r\n\r\nprogramme   is  not  satisfactory,  or  that   it   is\r\n\r\nexercising  a harmful influence on children - all  these\r\n\r\ngeneralities will get us nowhere at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  comments  of  the  Minister,  in  all\r\n\r\nseriousness,  I  wish to bring the  attention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  some of the programmes I  happened  to\r\n\r\nlisten to. For instance, one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nday,  when  I was trying to tune in to some  classical\r\n\r\nmusic,  I  heard this sort of recital.  \"I  married  a\r\n\r\nwidow.  The widow has a daughter. The daughter married\r\n\r\nmy father. My father and my wife's daughter gave birth\r\n\r\nto a daughter. So my wife's daughter\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You have got it all wrong!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - \"Gave birth to a daughter who\r\n\r\nbecomes my mother.\" This is the sort of programme  one\r\n\r\nsometimes  gets  from the radio.  The  other  type  of\r\n\r\nprogramme,  Mr Speaker, Sir, is what  one  gets,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, on a Sunday night when you like to  tune  in\r\n\r\nto  some good music or some good talks. You tune in to\r\n\r\nthe radio, and try to find where you can get something\r\n\r\nyou  like.  Then you hear the trotting of the  horses,\r\n\r\n\"Trot,  trot, trot, trot, trot\". Then we have all  the\r\n\r\nYankee  talking which is not very good for the  school\r\n\r\nchildren.   In   the  daytime  there  are   programmes\r\n\r\nspecially for children which appear in the papers with\r\n\r\nheadings like \"Tarzan\", \"Flash Gordon\" and others. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I am only commenting  on  the  English\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  In  general, the Chinese  programmes  are\r\n\r\nreasonably good. I think action must be taken  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, since the Ministers are so busy, to keep a\r\n\r\ncloser  surveillance  on  the programmes  produced  by\r\n\r\nRadio Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I fear the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nlistened to that rather complicated song with one  ear\r\n\r\nglued  to  the radio and probably with the  other  can\r\n\r\nglued  to  somewhere else. I think that is the \r\n\r\nwell-known and very popular song called, \"I am my own\r\n\r\ngrand-pa\"  or \"grand-ma\". I see nothing offensive about  it.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, it is a very enjoyable song, and I would not\r\n\r\nmind joining the Member for Hong Lim in a short chorus\r\n\r\nafter the proceedings are over in this Assembly!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other observation about the trotting of\r\n\r\nhorses,  sounding like Yankee trotting, I thought  the\r\n\r\ntrotting  of  horses anywhere sounds like trotting  of\r\n\r\nhorses.  I  cannot distinguish between a Yankee  horse\r\n\r\nand  a  Malayan horse or an Indian horse.  As  regards\r\n\r\n\"Tarzan\", I think there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  nothing  offensive about \"Tarzan\". In  fact,  even\r\n\r\nMinisters and intellectuals like it. In fact,  not  so\r\n\r\nlong  ago,  I  read  an article in the  New  Statesman\r\n\r\nanalysing  the  social and political  significance  of\r\n\r\n\"Tarzan\". The New Statesman, the Member for  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nwill admit, is not a colonial paper; nor is it run  by\r\n\r\nThomson or Blades. The paper was quite satisfied  that\r\n\r\n\"Tarzan\"   is   a   very   healthy   form   of   comic\r\n\r\nentertainment,  unlike  the  more  obnoxious  type  of\r\n\r\ncomics  which  I am quite sure the Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  has effectively dealt with. But  if  some  of\r\n\r\nthem  have escaped his notice, that cannot be  helped.\r\n\r\nBut  I  cannot  see  what  is offensive  about  either\r\n\r\n\"Tarzan\"  or  \"Flash Gordon\". In  fact,  there  is  no\r\n\r\n\"Flash Gordon\" over Radio Singapore as far as I  know.\r\n\r\nThere  is  certainly  a \"Tarzan\"  programme,  but  not\r\n\r\n\"Flash  Gordon\". So I assume that the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim has been tuning on to the short-wave and listening\r\n\r\nto  programmes from that terrible country, the  Yankee\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the point I would like\r\n\r\nto  make  is this. You will recollect that soon  after\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   took  over  Radio  Singapore,   there\r\n\r\ndefinitely came over the programmes a certain definite\r\n\r\nchange. I personally welcomed that change. Many people\r\n\r\nmight disagree with me, but I personally welcomed that\r\n\r\nchange.  The  programmes were good. A lot of  nonsense\r\n\r\nwas  cut  out from Radio Singapore and the  programmes\r\n\r\nwere  good.  Then  the Government began  to  think  of\r\n\r\ncommercial radio or commercial programmes.  And  then,\r\n\r\nlo and behold, Mr Speaker, Sir, suddenly there was  a\r\n\r\ndrop, a drop even below the level Radio Singapore  had\r\n\r\nreached  before the Minister took over.  What  I   find\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  reconcile is this.  If  the  programmes\r\n\r\noriginally put up by Radio Singapore at the time  when\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  took over were not of a type  which  he\r\n\r\nwould  allow  through  his  radio,  how  does  he  now\r\n\r\nreconcile  programmes reaching the whole of  Singapore\r\n\r\nat a level much lower than what it was when he took\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover?  But if he says that the introduction of dollars\r\n\r\nand   cents  into  this  business  has  made  all  the\r\n\r\ndifference to his Government, I accept the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I disagree with the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  that the programmes have declined  since\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of the commercial service.  I  think\r\n\r\nRadio Singapore has even prevailed upon the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  to take part in some of the  programmes,\r\n\r\nand  I  am quite sure that thereby - at least I for  one\r\n\r\nwould  like to think so - the standard of the programme\r\n\r\nhas not necessarily deteriorated. All that he said was\r\n\r\nthat, as a result of introducing a commercial service,\r\n\r\nwe have more popular programmes. I have said that too.\r\n\r\nThe total amount devoted to serious programme is about\r\n\r\nan  hour  and  a half every day out of a  broadcasting\r\n\r\ntime  of  about  seven or eight hours.  The  rest  are\r\n\r\ndevoted  to the very popular, the medium popular,  and\r\n\r\nthe highbrow popular type of music. To offset that and\r\n\r\nto ensure that we get a more serious type of music and\r\n\r\na  more  serious type of programme, we are introducing\r\n\r\n\"Suara Singapura\" where you will probably get the kind\r\n\r\nof  programme that an intellectual of the  calibre  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Farrer Park would be  interested  in\r\n\r\nlistening to. So there has been no general decline  in\r\n\r\nthe standard of programmes unless you say that popular\r\n\r\nentertainment is a lower standard, with which I do not\r\n\r\nagree.  But  if you mean that we are not  having  more\r\n\r\nsymphony  music, that is true, because  once  we  have\r\n\r\nensured  that  we  are  going  on  to  the  commercial\r\n\r\nservice,  unfortunately not many commercial firms  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to sponsor a symphony orchestra or  symphony\r\n\r\nmusic.  But for the coming year a number of commercial\r\n\r\nfirms  have agreed to sponsor Malay music and  Chinese\r\n\r\nmusic  of a more serious kind as an experiment.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  sure  that  even in the commercial  service  an\r\n\r\nexperiment  of  this  kind would  help  to  raise  the\r\n\r\ncultural   standards  and  the  cultural   tastes   of\r\n\r\nlisteners to Radio Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 47 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $100*.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*The same amendment stood in the name of Tun Lim Yew Hock.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are one or two topics which I wish to\r\n\r\ntouch on, particularly the first topic, which is Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore -  Radio Singapore, and what  service  it  is\r\n\r\nproviding  Singapore  with  today.  Besides  providing\r\n\r\nSingapore  with a commercial service, which brings  in\r\n\r\ngreat  profit  to  itself, it also provides  Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  a  news  service,  which  is  one  of  its  more\r\n\r\nimportant  functions. It reports Assembly debates  and\r\n\r\nother  matters.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I  am  particularly\r\n\r\ninterested today in the reports which Radio  Singapore\r\n\r\nput up about Assembly debates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal conditions, when the Assembly meets,\r\n\r\nthe  time  is  Government time, and the Opposition  is\r\n\r\nthere merely to see if it can get in a word if it can.\r\n\r\nBut  on the Budget, Mr Speaker, Sir, most of the time\r\n\r\nis  Opposition time. If the Opposition does not choose\r\n\r\nto  query an item, that item lapses merely because the\r\n\r\nGovernment accepts it all. Over the last three or four\r\n\r\ndays,  the  manner in which Radio Singapore  has  been\r\n\r\nreporting Assembly debates, Mr Speaker, Sir,  to  put\r\n\r\nit mildly, is absolutely deplorable. All it does is to\r\n\r\nput out the Ministers' replies. The questions put, the\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which  a  question  is  put,  the  further\r\n\r\nquestions  put on the Ministers' statements,  are  not\r\n\r\nreported at all. The impression Radio Singapore  gives\r\n\r\nis   that   Government  has  answered  every  question\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily.  But  from the Opposition's  point  of\r\n\r\nview,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that is not  so.  There  are\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  questions  which  go  unanswered  by  the\r\n\r\nMinisters. And yet this aspect of the situation is not\r\n\r\nbrought out in the Radio Singapore reports. I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  why that should be so. When the P.A.P. came into\r\n\r\npower,  the  position was not bad  at  all.  Both  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  and  the Government got a fair  amount  of\r\n\r\ntime  on Radio Singapore. But as time marches on,  the\r\n\r\nOpposition gets less and less time on Radio Singapore.\r\n\r\nEven  the Opposition Members' names are not mentioned.\r\n\r\nWhy  is  it? Are we on the Opposition lepers? Are  not\r\n\r\nour  names  worth mentioning if we raise a  matter  in\r\n\r\nwhich the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic is interested, particularly in a Budget debate?\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, we are not asking for publicity. But\r\n\r\nwe  are  asking that Radio Singapore gives  a  correct\r\n\r\npicture  to the public outside of what takes place  in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber. That is its duty, and that is  why  the\r\n\r\npublic is voting it these sums of money in order  that\r\n\r\nit  might  bring  to the public a fair  and  impartial\r\n\r\npicture  of what goes on inside here. But  if  you  go\r\n\r\nhome  and  listen to the 9.30 p.m. news, what  do  you\r\n\r\nget? \"The Minister said this. The Minister said that\",\r\n\r\nand  nobody else said anything. Everything  is \r\n\r\nhunky-dory  with  the Government. God is in His heaven,  and\r\n\r\neverything   is  all  right  with  the  world.   Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  sitting  tight and  pretty  and  nobody\r\n\r\nbothers it. Its little world is preserved. Its  little\r\n\r\nworld  is protected.

I am just wondering, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  whether  in these instances he  has  called  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the Press into his office and in  a\r\n\r\nvery,  very friendly manner, as a P.A.P.

I have seen that with  my  own  eyes.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish first to\r\n\r\nspeak  on  the  question  of  running  the  radio  and\r\n\r\ntelevision.  In  my opinion, there are  two  types  of\r\n\r\nradio  in  the world - one is run by the State  and  the\r\n\r\nother is run by partisan groups like the Pathet Lao in\r\n\r\nLaos  or  the  army  in Thailand, which  has  its  own\r\n\r\nseparate  radio.  The  navy,  the  police,  and  other\r\n\r\npartisan  groups too have their own radios. The  other\r\n\r\ntype  of  radio is run by the State. In  a  democratic\r\n\r\nState  like ours the radio and all the other media  of\r\n\r\ninformation must give some consideration to  political\r\n\r\nviews  different from those of the persons in  control\r\n\r\nof  the  State  organs. The reports  on  the  Assembly\r\n\r\ndebates  are  much to be deplored. For instance,  last\r\n\r\nnight, after the 7 o'clock news, there was a report on\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly debates which was written by a  reporter\r\n\r\nof  Radio Singapore, who announced himself as Mr Vas.\r\n\r\nThere is much left to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe   desired   in  that  particular  report   of   the\r\n\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in certain countries, say, like\r\n\r\nAustralia, the proceedings of Parliament are broadcast\r\n\r\nover the radio, and that is what the Government is now\r\n\r\nscared  of. If we have proceedings broadcast over  the\r\n\r\nradio,  there is no necessity for a report from  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  or from the Ministry of Culture to  make  a\r\n\r\nsummary  in  his own words about what  he  called  the\r\n\r\n\"proceedings\". Mr Speaker, Sir, the best alternative,\r\n\r\nof  course,  is to broadcast the proceedings  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly. The second alternative, which should go hand\r\n\r\nin hand with the first, is to remind the Government of\r\n\r\nwhat the P.A.P. has declared, i.e. to make the radio a\r\n\r\nstatutory corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I remind this House of a speech\r\n\r\nmade  by the Prime Minister in Hansard, Vol. 2,  col.62 -\r\n\r\n                     \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What is the date?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> 5th September, 1956.

So perhaps we had better  try\r\n\r\nand confine ourselves at the moment to Radio Singapore\r\n\r\nand leave out television.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am only\r\n\r\ntouching  on  television  in  passing.  What  we   are\r\n\r\ndiscussing  today is the policy of the  Government  on\r\n\r\nthe media of information. First of all, these media of\r\n\r\ninformation  should  be  run by  public  corporations.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  the  debates  on the  proceedings  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly should be reported in a more impartial manner\r\n\r\nby the reporters, who we know have to take orders from\r\n\r\nthe   Government.  I  sympathise  with  them  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  disseminating the news and  views  of  other\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other point I wish to raise is\r\n\r\nthis:  that  during the early days of June this  year,\r\n\r\nRadio  Singapore  broadcast not only Government  news,\r\n\r\nbut  statements  issued in the  name  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nCommittee of the People's Action Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other matter which I want to\r\n\r\nraise   under   this   Head   is   the   question   of\r\n\r\ndiscrimination in the treatment of the Press. We  know\r\n\r\nthat discrimination-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The point has already been\r\n\r\nraised  as to whether or not a criticism of the  Press\r\n\r\nas  a  criticism can properly be made in  Committee  of\r\n\r\nSupply proceedings, and I have ruled that if there  is\r\n\r\nto  be  a direct criticism of the Press as such, then,\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  matter is completely irrelevant  to  the\r\n\r\nmatters  we  are debating in the Committee of  Supply.\r\n\r\nBut  if  there is an allegation that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  controls  the Press, then,  of  course,  the\r\n\r\ndebate can proceed on those lines, and on those  lines\r\n\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am only\r\n\r\ndealing with the relationship between the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture and the Press. As I have said just now,  there\r\n\r\nis  discrimination in the treatment of the  Press.  As\r\n\r\nthere has been discrimination in the treatment between\r\n\r\nEuropean   business   and  local   business,   between\r\n\r\nexpatriate  civil servants, whose pay is  not  cut  at\r\n\r\nall,  and the local civil servants, so there  is  also\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  in the treatment of  the  Press.  From\r\n\r\nwhat  I  know, during the past 18 months  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  has  never  been hauled up  by  the  Government\r\n\r\nexcept  in the case of a local reporter of the  Sunday\r\n\r\nMail,  a subsidiary of the Straits Times. But most  of\r\n\r\nthe  other local newspapers, particularly the  Chinese\r\n\r\nvernacular Press, are living in jitters. Editors  have\r\n\r\nbeen  hauled up, sub-editors questioned and  reporters\r\n\r\nthreatened.  All  the promises which  this  Government\r\n\r\nmade  before or during the election about the \r\n\r\nBritish-owned  Press  have  now vanished into  thin  air.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Straits  Times  of\r\n\r\n16th  April, 1959, the Secretary General of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... it was an open secret the Straits Times editorial\r\n\r\nstaff was \"scooting\" to Kuala Lumpur on May 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those who followed the paper's view should\r\n\r\n\"scoot along with them,\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was no use, he continued, for Cynicus to say\r\n\r\nregularly  \"We Malayans\" when he knew very  well  that\r\n\r\n\"those blooming scoundrels in the Straits Times\"  were\r\n\r\nthe people who would run away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The people who write that are the people who would\r\n\r\nrun away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an open secret that the Straits Times\r\n\r\neditorial  staff are scooting off to Kuala  Lumpur  on\r\n\r\nMay 18.\"'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>These   charges  were  repeated  by  other   Ministers\r\n\r\npresent.

It is not because the attitude  of\r\n\r\nthe  Straits Times has changed, but because the policy\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. has vitally departed from what they had\r\n\r\npromised the people. This is what the present Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Culture  said  in  a  report  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nStandard,  dated 30th April, 1959, about  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`After a reference to a Straits Times editorial on\r\n\r\nthe  freedom of the Press, Mr Rajaratnam said:  \"This\r\n\r\nsounded  very  nice  but one thing the  Straits  Times\r\n\r\nfailed to answer is, freedom for whom?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Freedom of the Press is the freedom of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I  need  a\r\n\r\npositive,  clear and sincere reply from  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture  in this Assembly, and not  outside  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, as to whether the Government is prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept this. If the Government is not prepared  to  do\r\n\r\nso,  I suppose it cannot be helped. It is left to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to pass judgment on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture  has  set aside a sum of money for expenditure\r\n\r\non Dewan Bahasa dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan and that its\r\n\r\nhead is to come from our neighbour, Indonesia. What  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  know further from  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  is  this. What are the plans that  have  been\r\n\r\nformulated  by  the  head of  the  Dewan,  and  is  it\r\n\r\npossible  that  he  will be able  to  discharge  his\r\n\r\nobligations with only one stenographer? Perhaps in its\r\n\r\nlong-term  planning, the Government has a  prospective\r\n\r\nsuccessor to take over. Could the Minister tell us who\r\n\r\nwill be the prospective head of the Institute, as this\r\n\r\nis an important post?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in connection with Radio Singapore\r\n\r\n(Malay  section),  I  would like clarification  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is the policy of the Government  to  give\r\n\r\npart-time  employment  to  people  who  already   have\r\n\r\npermanent  jobs.  If  that  is  the  policy   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, what is the reason for it? In addition  to\r\n\r\nthat, I am also told that the part-time employees  are\r\n\r\nrelatives  of  the staff currently employed  in  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  (Malay section). Is this really  happening?\r\n\r\nWhy  are  employment  opportunities  closed  to  other\r\n\r\nbetter able persons who are unemployed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point, Mr Speaker, Sir. Quite\r\n\r\noften  I  hear  the  news items from  Radio  Singapore\r\n\r\n(Malay  Section),  and I am afraid that  its  standard\r\n\r\nwill  deteriorate because it could be  said  that  the\r\n\r\nMalay  announcers  read the news  items  like \r\n\r\nschool-children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I  think  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampong Kembangan was in order up  to  the\r\n\r\ntime when he touched on part-time employment, but when\r\n\r\nhe  touched on part-time employment and when  he  gave\r\n\r\ndetails  as  to  who were, in fact, employed,  then  I\r\n\r\nthink he was inclined to swing a bit far away from the\r\n\r\nmotion. The topic he is touching on now appears to  me\r\n\r\nto be a matter of detail. If it is a matter of detail,\r\n\r\nthen,  of course, he is too late. If he had wished  to\r\n\r\nraise  detailed points, he ought to have given  notice\r\n\r\nof   amendments  pinpointing  specific  items  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates.

Shall\r\n\r\nwe then dispose of Radio Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, Radio Singapore or any other\r\n\r\nradio  is  always  an  object of displeasure  for  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  always  an object of approval for the Government.\r\n\r\nIt  happens  in every country. I am quite  sure,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  if  by  some  misfortune we  should  be  in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  we  would be saying  precisely  the  same\r\n\r\nthings that Members of the Opposition have said.  But,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  I  suggest that reports of proceedings  which\r\n\r\nlast  from  2.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. cannot  be  summarised\r\n\r\ninto  a ten-minute bulletin without a great deal being\r\n\r\nleft  out; and, secondly, that the assessment of  news\r\n\r\nvaries    with    individual    reporters    in    any\r\n\r\norganisation - three  reporters  often  cover  the  same\r\n\r\nitem - giving  different emphasis to different  speakers\r\n\r\nand  different  speeches.  In  fact,  this  point   is\r\n\r\nstrengthened by the allegation made by the Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer   Park  that  not  only  has  Radio   Singapore\r\n\r\noverlooked some of the weighty pronouncements  he  has\r\n\r\nmade but the Press too has done the same thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture and his officials\r\n\r\ncould  not,  when the debate is finished,  go  to  the\r\n\r\nrespective  newspaper offices and say to the  editors,\r\n\r\n\"Go   and  take  a  blue  pencil  and  cross  out  the\r\n\r\npronouncements  that have been made by the  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers.\"   For  example,  yesterday   most   of   the\r\n\r\nofficials,  the  Ministers and  so  on,  were  at  the\r\n\r\nAirport  to see somebody off. So to suggest  that  any\r\n\r\nreporting done by these newspapers yesterday is due to\r\n\r\nany instruction from the Minister or from the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture is both unfounded and false. Except, as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said before, where there is a big issue, we have\r\n\r\nnot  summoned editors, as the Member for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nhas  said.  We  have invited editors and reporters  to\r\n\r\ncome  and discuss certain issues, certain topics which\r\n\r\nwe  would like to be emphasised. But apart from  that,\r\n\r\nif  a newspaper decides tomorrow to black-out a speech\r\n\r\nby  a  Minister or by the Opposition, there is nothing\r\n\r\nwe can do about it. So the Opposition has been trying,\r\n\r\nright  from the start, to create this rift, to conjure\r\n\r\nup  this  picture  which they had painted  before  the\r\n\r\nelections: that here are people who would line up  the\r\n\r\nPress and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngive  them instructions and tell them, \"Today this  is\r\n\r\nwhat  you are going to report; this is what you should\r\n\r\ndo,  and this is what you should not do.\" But if  what\r\n\r\nthey  are  complaining about, as far as the  Press  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, is that at some certain time they feel that\r\n\r\ntheir  words are not being given the weight that  they\r\n\r\nshould  be given, that is a matter for them,  and  not\r\n\r\nfor the Government, to take up with the Press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as for reporting over Radio Singapore, I am\r\n\r\nprepared  to put every Member of the Opposition  to  a\r\n\r\ntest.  I can invite them today, after this debate,  to\r\n\r\ncome to the office where the reporters will be writing\r\n\r\nup the speeches that are being made here and ask them,\r\n\r\n\"Would  you  mind giving me a 10-minute summary\" - which\r\n\r\nis  about four pages of what might amount to 30 or  40\r\n\r\npages  of a full news report - \"to go over the  air  by\r\n\r\nhalf-past nine?\", i.e., it must be ready by 9  o'clock\r\n\r\np.m.  I  am quite prepared to put every Member of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition to a test, and I am quite sure,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\neach one will give a different version which will  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  approval of other Members on the Opposition\r\n\r\nside. So this type of argument that they are not given\r\n\r\nfair   play,  that  their  speeches  are   not   given\r\n\r\nsufficient weight, is one which will be repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been a newspaper man for 15 years, and I know\r\n\r\nevery  time newspapers come out with a report,  people\r\n\r\nalways ring up and say. \"You know, the criticism which\r\n\r\nI  have  spent three weeks composing has been  blacked\r\n\r\nout.\"  Or, \"I have made a very pertinent case  against\r\n\r\nmy  opponent which should have squashed him,  but  you\r\n\r\nhave  left it out. I made a long and involved argument\r\n\r\nbut  you just missed out one crucial link which  makes\r\n\r\nthe  whole  argument  sound  foolish.\"  That  sort  of\r\n\r\nobservation  is  always made  and  I  am  afraid  that\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition should resign themselves  to\r\n\r\nthat  fact. The Opposition should not indulge in  this\r\n\r\ncampaign  that they have been conducting for the  last\r\n\r\n18  months  to  present the Ministry of  Culture,  its\r\n\r\nofficials,   its   Minister,  and  its   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  having  a  torture room to which  they  bring  the\r\n\r\neditors  and  reporters, and there twist  their  arms,\r\n\r\nslap  them and say, \"Now, you have been bad  boys.  Go\r\n\r\nback and write as we say.\" If they want to put forward\r\n\r\nthat kind of suggestion, the first people to laugh  at\r\n\r\nit would be the reporters and the editors themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Member for Hong Lim, also a champion of\r\n\r\nthe freedom of the Press, ended up by saying that what\r\n\r\nwe  should do is to ban the Straits Times. He is still\r\n\r\na champion of the freedom of the Press. He is trying a\r\n\r\ndifferent  line, with different arms.  The  Opposition\r\n\r\nhas been trying very hard to present a picture showing\r\n\r\nus  torturing  and  twisting of the arms  of  editors;\r\n\r\nwhereas  the Member for Hong Lim decides that he  will\r\n\r\nplay the game that he has been trying to play for  the\r\n\r\nlast  few  days.  He appears as the  champion  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Press.  He  says that we  are  discriminating\r\n\r\nagainst the Chinese Press, so at the same time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all the\r\n\r\nnationalist Press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim defines a \"nationalist paper\" simply as  any\r\n\r\npaper which would refrain from publishing things which\r\n\r\nmight embarrass him, or publish things which might  be\r\n\r\nof  value to him. All I can say is that, as far as  we\r\n\r\nare  concerned,  if the Press is working  against  the\r\n\r\ninterests of this country, then, regardless of whether\r\n\r\nit  is Chinese, Indian, Malay or English-speaking,  we\r\n\r\nwill  proceed against it. It is no use talking in  one\r\n\r\nbreath  about the freedom of Speech, and then  in  the\r\n\r\nnext breadth asking lo ban a paper because you do  not\r\n\r\nlike  it.  He  therefore  takes  this  line:  he   has\r\n\r\ndecided - this is not a strategy unknown to  us - that  he\r\n\r\nhad better cultivate one particular section and he now\r\n\r\nappears as the champion of the Chinese Press. Then  he\r\n\r\ngoes  on  to  say  that  we are  bad  because  English\r\n\r\npapers - he  did  not say so but he implied  it - go  scot\r\n\r\nfree.  That  is  not true. We will ban  any  newspaper\r\n\r\nwhich   is   thought  to  be  yellow - the   Weekender,\r\n\r\npublished  by  the  Straits Times, a  lot  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nmosquito  papers,  Malay  mosquito  papers,  journals.\r\n\r\nThen, to reinforce his point - as usual, he has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  regard  for facts - he said that we had  banned  the\r\n\r\nSaturday Post.

We had never  stopped  the\r\n\r\nChina Press from coming here. But he has to appear  as\r\n\r\nthe  champion of the Chinese Press. Then, after a long\r\n\r\ndefence  of  the Press, he ends up by suggesting  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government should ban the Straits Times. Why? Can\r\n\r\nhe  give any reason?

Such an implication\r\n\r\nis  not  true. All they have got to do is to find  out\r\n\r\nfrom the Pressmen and editors themselves. We are quite\r\n\r\nopen  and  clear  about what we do. I have  called  up\r\n\r\neditors and discussed things with them. In fact, to be\r\n\r\nquite  frank  with  you,  I  have  indicated  to   one\r\n\r\nnewspaper that when the subject of education comes up,\r\n\r\nto  beware  of  the Member for Hong Lim because  I  am\r\n\r\nquite convinced that he is going to exploit that  from\r\n\r\na  more  or  less communal angle, but if the newspaper\r\n\r\nthinks that that sort of thing is worth publishing, it\r\n\r\nis up to it. It is up to the papers. If they decide to\r\n\r\ngive  the Member for Hong Lim full play, they  can  do\r\n\r\nso. To that extent, I think we are quite justified  in\r\n\r\ndoing   it,  because  in  the  past  I  know   various\r\n\r\npoliticians who were Members of the Government and who\r\n\r\nhad  approached me and said, \"Well, you know, you have\r\n\r\nbeen attacking us.

I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether any of you have read the newspapers today. The\r\n\r\nlast  thing that the Government would want to  do  is,\r\n\r\nfirst,   to   make  this  Assembly  an  occasion   for\r\n\r\nbroadcasting  things which might land Radio  Singapore\r\n\r\nin extensive libel suits, unless, of course, at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  same time, we take care to pass laws to indemnify\r\n\r\nRadio  Singapore against possible action.

Though it is\r\n\r\ndone in Australia, many other countries have turned it\r\n\r\ndown  on  the  ground that, far from this  becoming  a\r\n\r\ndebating Chamber, it becomes a tub-thumping arena  for\r\n\r\nan  electioneering campaign and for  saying  downright\r\n\r\nlies, it is very interesting that the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim has got interested in this-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of\r\n\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Therefore, the third question  as\r\n\r\nto who would be his successor, that, of course, is not\r\n\r\nfor  me  to say, because I am sure that if I  did  so,\r\n\r\nthat would start another debate from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother side of the House. We hope that we will be  able\r\n\r\nto  train somebody who will succeed him when his  term\r\n\r\nis up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point brought up by the Member for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan  is whether the Government  accepts\r\n\r\nMalay culture as the basis for Malayan culture. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  new argument. This argument has been going  on\r\n\r\nfor  some  time,  and I would not like  to  repeat  in\r\n\r\ndetail the series of arguments that have been going on\r\n\r\nfor  the  last  two or three months. The  Government's\r\n\r\nposition  is this. We do not know what is  meant  when\r\n\r\nyou  say Malay culture should be the basis for Malayan\r\n\r\nculture. I have asked representatives who came to  see\r\n\r\nme,  \"Does  it mean that the Government should  accept\r\n\r\nMalay  culture as the basis for Malayan  culture?\"  An\r\n\r\nessential of culture is religion. And it will be taken\r\n\r\nto  mean as such by other communities. If tomorrow the\r\n\r\nGovernment boldly comes out and says, \"Yes, we  accept\r\n\r\nMalay culture as the basis for Malayan culture\", there\r\n\r\nwill  be a lot of misunderstanding. The first question\r\n\r\nthat  people  will ask is: Does that mean that  Islam,\r\n\r\nwhich is the basis of Malay culture, must become  part\r\n\r\nof  Malayan culture, and that those who do not profess\r\n\r\nIslam must remain outside the pale of Malayan culture?\r\n\r\nThat  is  a  question to which we must get a  definite\r\n\r\nreply, that is, either you say, \"No, that is not  what\r\n\r\nwe  mean when we say that Malay culture should be  the\r\n\r\nbasis for Malayan culture.\" Or again, culture includes\r\n\r\ncustoms;  the  costumes that you wear,  your  marriage\r\n\r\nceremonies. So will Malay costumes, the Malay marriage\r\n\r\nceremony,  Malay beliefs, Malay habits, the  kind  of\r\n\r\nfood they eat - does it mean, when you say Malay culture\r\n\r\nshould  be  the  basis for Malayan culture,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should not recognise anything except  these\r\n\r\nthings?  Or  do  you  exclude  all  these  from   your\r\n\r\ndefinition  of \"Malayan culture\"? I read an  editorial\r\n\r\nin  the Utusan Melayu which dealt with this point.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  I met a Malay delegation which came to see  me.\r\n\r\nThe  only  sound  basis  which  would  not  create   a\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding,  because  the  Government   is   not\r\n\r\nprepared, in a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  society, to announce a slogan  which  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  create misunderstanding and  confusion,  is\r\n\r\nthis.  We said that the only sensible thing we can  do\r\n\r\nis to accept one thing as a basis for Malayan culture,\r\n\r\nand that is the Malay language, which has already been\r\n\r\nso accepted. Language is an essential part of culture.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  the  Utusan Melayu, in a  very  interesting\r\n\r\neditorial, eventually came to the same conclusion - that\r\n\r\nall that you can press for is to ask the Government to\r\n\r\ndeclare  that  the  Malay language be  the  basis  for\r\n\r\nMalayan  culture. If that is the case,  we  are  quite\r\n\r\nprepared  to  accept that. But to go beyond  that,  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  vague statement that Malay culture should  be\r\n\r\nthe  basis for Malayan culture and leave it  at  that,\r\n\r\nwould  be dangerous, because it would cause a reaction\r\n\r\non the part of the other communities who will say that\r\n\r\nthis  Government is going to force Islam on them,  and\r\n\r\nforce  customs and habits which belong to a different\r\n\r\ncommunity on them. But if what is really meant is that\r\n\r\nthe Government should recognise the Malay language  as\r\n\r\nthe  basis for a Malayan culture, there is some  sense\r\n\r\nto   it,  and  this  can  be  accepted  by  the  other\r\n\r\ncommunities without any fear or confusion. But  beyond\r\n\r\nthat,  I do not think the Government is quite prepared\r\n\r\nto  go  because we feel that this might  result  in  a\r\n\r\ngrave  and  serious misunderstanding which might  have\r\n\r\nother consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Kandasamy, may I just remind the House of the Standard of the 30th April, 1959,\r\n\r\nwith the heading:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`PAP guns turn on the Straits Times Paper accused:\r\n\r\nYou  have misled english-educated Rajaratnam leads the\r\n\r\nattack again'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is the heading.

I  wish  this\r\n\r\nmatter to be treated calmly. It is possible too that I\r\n\r\nmight be accused of being a political adventurer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of Malay culture\r\n\r\nas the basis of Malayan culture, this is a matter that\r\n\r\nhas  long  been  debated  and  discussed  by  experts,\r\n\r\nwhether  they  be in the Federation of  Malaya  or  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Misunderstanding arose. As a result of  the\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding, I have had occasion to meet a number\r\n\r\nof  experts, including the head of the Permanent Malay\r\n\r\nLiterary  Congress, who told me that he regretted  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of certain circles who sought to  drag  this\r\n\r\nquestion   of  culture  through  political   channels,\r\n\r\nthereby  giving rise to the unhappy consequences  that\r\n\r\nwe  see  today.  He and other people in the  Permanent\r\n\r\nMalay  Literary Congress are of the opinion that  they\r\n\r\nare the people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nwho  are well qualified to deal with this matter,  and\r\n\r\nthey have done so through a memorandum which they have\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to  the Minister for Culture in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  memorandum,  I believe, is now receiving  careful\r\n\r\nattention.  The  Malay cultural experts  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nhave  stressed to me that these matters should rightly\r\n\r\nbe  taken  up by cultural experts who are  really  and\r\n\r\nthoroughly  expert in this particular matter,  because\r\n\r\nit  is  only the cultured people who really  know  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  culture and who really do know anything  at\r\n\r\nall about culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the remarks that Members on the Back\r\n\r\nbenches  are but small fry, I would like to  say,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  that these so-called  small  fry  have\r\n\r\nnever  given  official  replies  to  the  question  of\r\n\r\nculture. What has taken place is that I had spoken  on\r\n\r\nthe  matter  when the Permanent Language and  Literary\r\n\r\nCongress  in  Singapore was welcoming the  arrival  of\r\n\r\nProf. Slamet Muljana, who is the present head of Dewan\r\n\r\nBahasa of Singapore. I said then that, to the best  of\r\n\r\nmy   knowledge,  Government  had  never  refused   nor\r\n\r\naccepted the concept of Malay culture being the  basis\r\n\r\nof  a  Malayan  culture. But the very  next  day,  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  reported to the effect that the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  never accepted the concept  of  Malay\r\n\r\nculture  being  the basis of Malayan culture,  and  my\r\n\r\nname was quoted in respect of that report. I took  the\r\n\r\nstep  to write to the papers concerned to clarify  the\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to stress with\r\n\r\nall  sincerity, that those of us, who  are  taking  up\r\n\r\nthis  matter  for the purpose of evolving  a  peaceful\r\n\r\nsociety in the interest of our people should not utter\r\n\r\nanything  in  our  speeches that would  give  rise  to\r\n\r\ndisharmony   in   matters   concerning   the   various\r\n\r\nideologies of the people in Singapore. I am no  expert\r\n\r\non  cultural matters myself. Therefore, I feel  it  is\r\n\r\nonly  proper  that the concept of Malay culture  being\r\n\r\nthe basis of a Malayan culture should be left to those\r\n\r\nwho  know  it  to deal with it. A memorandum  on  this\r\n\r\nconcept has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to the Minister for Culture by a body  that\r\n\r\nrepresents  all  the organisations  which  are  really\r\n\r\ninterested  in this matter of culture. They  and  they\r\n\r\nalone  are the people who should be dealing with  this\r\n\r\nmatter.

I say it is only  the  experts\r\n\r\nalone who really know the true worth of the matter and\r\n\r\nwho   can  distinguish  between  precious  stones  and\r\n\r\nimitation stones.

The task of evolving it is  a\r\n\r\ndifficult  one. The Ministry of Culture was formed  at\r\n\r\nthe  time  when  this Government  took  the  reins  of\r\n\r\noffice.  It  was expected then that the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture had a definite concept or had ideas which were\r\n\r\nacceptable  for  them  to  be  carried  out.  Now  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been in power for well over a year, but\r\n\r\nwhat we find today is that the efforts of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture are still vague. A big amount of money  is\r\n\r\nto  be allocated to the Ministry for plans which  are,\r\n\r\nof  course, very useful to the country, but  money  is\r\n\r\nbadly needed for the welfare of the people. If such  a\r\n\r\nbig  amount  of money is spent without bringing  about\r\n\r\nbeneficial results to the country, then I say that  is\r\n\r\nwrong. Culture is something that should encompass  all\r\n\r\nraces in this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry.  It is a matter that cannot be formulated  by\r\n\r\nany  particular individual or by any particular  group\r\n\r\nof  people.  It  cannot be forced upon the  people  by\r\n\r\nanybody  or by any organisation. It is something  that\r\n\r\nis  alive, and it grows by itself only. What we can do\r\n\r\nis  to  prevent what is bad from evolving so  that  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not become part and parcel of the people  living\r\n\r\nin  this  country.  If this is the  only  plan  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out by the Ministry, then I feel that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  right that we spend a sum to the tune of over  $7\r\n\r\nmillion  in  order to stamp out what is called  yellow\r\n\r\nculture,  about which the Government keeps on crowing.\r\n\r\nIf  so  much  money is to be spent for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nwiping  out  yellow culture, then I feel  that  it  is\r\n\r\nmoney not wisely spent. If we compare the work done by\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Culture with that of other Ministries,\r\n\r\nwe  see that very little work of a cultural nature has\r\n\r\nbeen done. There are many things that we are short of.\r\n\r\nWe still need more staff in the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\nIn  view  of the shortage of staff in the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation, I feel that that sum of over $7 million  to\r\n\r\nbe  spent  by  the Ministry of Culture, which  has  no\r\n\r\nspecific plans to achieve its purpose, is money  which\r\n\r\ncould  be  put  to  better  use  by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation. Culture should have its basis in education.\r\n\r\nEducation  will  enable the people  to  improve  their\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living and economic  conditions.  It  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  really to bring about the  evolution  of  a\r\n\r\nMalayan culture by the wish of the Government. If I am\r\n\r\nnot  wrong, I have read in the papers that it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible to bring about Malayan culture to people  who\r\n\r\nare  now beyond help, but that the process of evolving\r\n\r\nit  will begin with our children. Therefore, it is  my\r\n\r\nopinion that the money to be allocated to the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture  could more properly be allocated  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education. If  I  am  not  wrong  in  my\r\n\r\nanalysis,  there are about 600 Division I officers  in\r\n\r\nthe  Headquarters Division of the Ministry of Culture.\r\n\r\nMoney  is  very  much more needed in the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation. There are teachers attached to the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education, and these are the people who are really\r\n\r\nsuited  for the purpose of giving proper education  to\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren.

The question I  posed\r\n\r\nthen   was   whether  the  proposed  Malayan   culture\r\n\r\nenvisaged by the Government could be based upon  Malay\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEighteen months have passed, Sir, and yet we have  not\r\n\r\nhad a definite reply from the Minister himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not an expert on Malay culture. I know a\r\n\r\nfew  Malay  songs, and probably know how to dance  the\r\n\r\nrong-geng and say my prayers five times a day; but  I\r\n\r\ncannot  accept  the  statement  by  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the  Minister for National  Development\r\n\r\nwhen  he said that we in this Assembly should not take\r\n\r\npart  in  the debate on this issue because we are  not\r\n\r\nexperts on Malay culture. Sir, I think the stand taken\r\n\r\nby the Parliamentary Secretary is completely wrong. We\r\n\r\nare  being asked to vote a sum of over $7 million  for\r\n\r\nthe  running of the Ministry of Culture, and it is our\r\n\r\nduty   and  our  responsibility  as  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly to debate the issue and to get proper answers\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, culture is a very wide thing.

I  would\r\n\r\nrather suggest, Sir, to the Government that instead of\r\n\r\nforcing the people of Singapore to accept what I would\r\n\r\ncall a \"synthetic\" Malayan culture, it would be better\r\n\r\nthat they let the people themselves decide and let the\r\n\r\npeople themselves in their actions and in their way of\r\n\r\nlife evolve a culture which would be acceptable to all\r\n\r\nparties concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister might wish to say a few\r\n\r\nwords  in  reply and then we can pass  on  to  another\r\n\r\ntopic. If there is sufficient time, we will come back\r\n\r\nto Malay culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, much time has been spent on this\r\n\r\nsubject.  A great deal has been said by both sides  of\r\n\r\nthe  House as to what is the correct attitude to Malay\r\n\r\nculture.  Certain  Members of the  Opposition  want  a\r\n\r\nstraightforward declaration by the Government that  it\r\n\r\nis prepared to adopt Malay culture as the basis for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na Malayan culture. The Government stand is that we are\r\n\r\nnot  saying yes or no, because we do not know what the\r\n\r\nterm  means.  We are not sure about the definition  of\r\n\r\nMalay culture, because if once the Government makes  a\r\n\r\npolicy,  it must carry it out in some way and it  must\r\n\r\ndo  something to follow it up. The only thing  we  can\r\n\r\nsay  is  that we accept Malay as the national language\r\n\r\nand  that  we  are implementing it. People  have  been\r\n\r\ntaking  contradictory attitudes. On the one hand,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is told not to force culture. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the demand is made, \"Let the Government declare\r\n\r\nthat  Malay culture is the basis for Malayan culture.\"\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  contradiction. We say  that  culture  is\r\n\r\nsomething about which Government cannot declare, \"This\r\n\r\nis  a  Malay  culture  and that is  Malayan  culture.\"\r\n\r\nCulture  is  something which the  people  decide  for\r\n\r\nthemselves. All that the Government can do to  promote\r\n\r\nMalayan  culture is to create a Malayan  consciousness\r\n\r\nand  a  Malayan  loyalty. Anything that  hinders  that\r\n\r\nobjective, like the development of racialism, communal\r\n\r\noutlook,  exploitation of communal  feelings,  can  be\r\n\r\nminimised  or  stopped  by  the  Government.  To  that\r\n\r\nextent,  the  Government is carrying out a  policy  to\r\n\r\nprevent the kind of thing that is happening in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nI  would  request all Members of this  House - not  only\r\n\r\nfrom  this  side but also from the other side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse - to read a book titled \"Emergency, 1958 - The Story\r\n\r\nof the Ceylon Race Riots\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think that is one of the most terrible books\r\n\r\nI  have  read.  It is written by a journalist  and  he\r\n\r\nsays,  in  developing his argument,  that  before  the\r\n\r\nriots  came  people said things were  very  nice.  The\r\n\r\nTamils  and Singhalese were getting on well  together;\r\n\r\neverything  was harmonious, the people said  it  could\r\n\r\nnot  happen in Ceylon. \"That is what we all thought\" - I\r\n\r\nam  just  quoting,  Sir. \"After  all,  we  have  lived\r\n\r\ntogether, Singhalese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Tamils,  for  so long, sharing  our  profits  and\r\n\r\nlosses.\"  Then he goes on to explain how  they  fought\r\n\r\ntogether  to  achieve self-government. Yet  ten  years\r\n\r\nafter that, something went wrong and they had the most\r\n\r\nterrible episode in Ceylonese history, when Singhalese\r\n\r\nand Tamils, who were far more akin to one another than\r\n\r\nthe   races   here,  indulged  in  the   most   brutal\r\n\r\nbestialities that can ever be conceived. In  fact,  he\r\n\r\nends  up  by saying that he wished that not only  the\r\n\r\nGovernment but also the people had foreseen  all  this\r\n\r\nand had done something to prevent its coming about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that the Government is doing is that though it\r\n\r\ncannot  determine what the future will be, it will  at\r\n\r\nleast  do  what  is humanly possible to avert  certain\r\n\r\nforeseen  dangers. Some people say  that  we  may  not\r\n\r\nsucceed  in creating a Malayan culture. For us Malayan\r\n\r\nculture is anything which would prevent antagonism and\r\n\r\nconflict  between the races. If we can  prevent  that,\r\n\r\nthen we will have justified our existence. If we fail,\r\n\r\nthen  when  people turn round and say,  \"Why  did  not\r\n\r\nsomebody do anything about it?\", at least we can  say,\r\n\r\n\"We  did our best, and we tried to avert it.\" So that,\r\n\r\nin  essence, is our attitude towards Malayan  culture.\r\n\r\nSo  as  regards the demand to declare what is  Malayan\r\n\r\nculture,  our stand is, we do not know what  it  means\r\n\r\nand  we Will not embark on making a slogan which might\r\n\r\nbe  misunderstood  outside  and  spark  off  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened in Ceylon. In Ceylon during the election  one\r\n\r\ngroup suddenly decided casually to raise a slogan - they\r\n\r\ndid  not  know  what  it meant at that  time - and  this\r\n\r\nstarted  the  events that ended in  the  Emergency  in\r\n\r\n1958.  At least, we hope that this Government and  the\r\n\r\nOpposition could at least prevent an emergency here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, in talking about Radio Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe  Press  generally and what directions he  gave  to\r\n\r\nthem, the Minister said, \"Yes, of course.

Now, how does one work\r\n\r\nagainst  the interests of a country? My conception  of\r\n\r\nthat,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, in a democratic country,  is\r\n\r\nthis - I take it that all this is against the background\r\n\r\nof  a  democratic government - one talks  about  working\r\n\r\nagainst the interests of the country when one indulges\r\n\r\nin  treason  against  the State, that  is,  trying  to\r\n\r\ndestroy the State in one way or the other, or sedition\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Government,  or  trying  to  upset  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  or  trying to create in  a  country  like\r\n\r\nSingapore  communal  troubles or  religious  troubles.\r\n\r\nThese, as I understand them, are some things which are\r\n\r\nagainst  the interests of the country. The  test,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, is: does the Government think they  are\r\n\r\nagainst  the  interests of the country? And  does  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  also think they are against the  interests\r\n\r\nof  the  country?  On  these matters,  Sir,  both  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Opposition are agreed there must be\r\n\r\nno  sedition; there must be no treason; there must  be\r\n\r\nno  incitement to communal troubles; there must be  no\r\n\r\nincitement to religious troubles. Therefore, we get to\r\n\r\nthe  situation  where all sections of the  public  are\r\n\r\nagreed  that  those are matters which are against  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a democratic State where we believe in the party\r\n\r\nsystem of democracy, each Party has a particular  line\r\n\r\nof policy which it offers to the country at elections,\r\n\r\nand  if that policy is acceptable, it is returned.  In\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  the  People's Action Party,  they  were\r\n\r\nreturned  on a programme with a 53 per cent vote;  47\r\n\r\nper  cent  went  against them. They were  returned  on\r\n\r\ncertain  policies - 53 per cent of the voters voted  for\r\n\r\nthem on those policies, and 47 per cent against. If on\r\n\r\nthose  policy issues there is a divergence of opinion,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I am suggesting to the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Culture  that  that is not  working  against  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the country. Definitely not. Certainly it\r\n\r\nmight be working against the interests of the Party in\r\n\r\npower.  The Opposition's quarrel is on these  matters:\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister is interfering with Radio Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  freedom of the Press merely in the interests\r\n\r\nof  his own Party. He does not wish his Government  to\r\n\r\nbe  shown up in a bad light. It is not undemocratic in\r\n\r\na  democratic State for the Government to be shown  up\r\n\r\nin  a  bad  light. The truth of the matter is this - the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government is oversensitive; it does not  like\r\n\r\nits  policies  to  be shown up in  a  bad  light;  and\r\n\r\nanybody  who  dares  to do that  is  rapped  over  the\r\n\r\nknuckles in no uncertain manner. Mr Speaker, Sir,  if\r\n\r\nit  goes to press, one can say it is not a matter  for\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly to discuss in detail. But when it  comes\r\n\r\nto  Radio Singapore, which is being kept alive out  of\r\n\r\npublic  funds, then it certainly becomes the  business\r\n\r\nof  this Assembly to see that its policy is the proper\r\n\r\npolicy.  I ask the Minister this in all sincerity:  if\r\n\r\nRadio  Singapore, in doing an honest job, holds  up  a\r\n\r\nparticular Minister in a light which the Minister does\r\n\r\nnot  like, or holds up the Government in a light which\r\n\r\nthe  Government  does not like, what action  will  the\r\n\r\nMinister  take? Will the Minister take  severe  action\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Head of Radio Singapore for holding  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  up  to contempt, to ridicule?  Unless  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  prepared  to accept the  situation,  I  am\r\n\r\nsuggesting  to them, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  they  are\r\n\r\nnot a democratic government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It appears to me that possibly the two\r\n\r\ntopics  could  be taken together - Radio  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nPress relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Concerning the two objections that\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Farrer Park has raised to substantiate\r\n\r\nhis  point that there is interference with the  Press.\r\n\r\nFirst, I think he is being completely inaccurate  when\r\n\r\nhe  says  that  newspapers are called  up  and  rapped\r\n\r\nacross the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknuckles, and so on. I have been a newspaperman, and I\r\n\r\nwish  the  Member  has read some  of  the  memoirs  of\r\n\r\njournalists about what happened in Britain during  the\r\n\r\nwar.  Churchill held press conferences  from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime,   even  after  the  war;  interviews  by   Press\r\n\r\nRelations  Officers,  whose  function  it  is  to  put\r\n\r\nnewspapermen   in   contact   with   statesmen,    and\r\n\r\npoliticians,  so that the latter can  put  over  their\r\n\r\nviews  to  try  to  persuade the Press  to  accept  or\r\n\r\nunderstand the Government's points of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Radio Singapore, it is true that Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  will not be allowed to carry on  an  attack\r\n\r\nagainst  Ministers. Similarly, it would not be allowed\r\n\r\nto  carry  on an attack against the Member for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  or the Member for Cairnhill. We will be just  as\r\n\r\nstrict  about  it.  In  fact, can  he  point  out  one\r\n\r\ninstance,  since  the  P.A.P. took  over,  when  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  had - we could have done it if we had  wanted\r\n\r\nto - attacked any Member of the Opposition? It must have\r\n\r\nbeen  in the presentation of news because, as you will\r\n\r\nhave seen, Sir, in the days when we had two newspapers\r\n\r\nhere, the same news was presented, but because it  had\r\n\r\nbeen  condensed  obviously one paper tended  to  place\r\n\r\nemphasis - though  factually correct  - which  displeased\r\n\r\none side, whereas the Straits Times presented the same\r\n\r\nnews  in  a  way  which flattered the same  side.  So,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  this vague suggestion that the  Government\r\n\r\nis  using knuckle-dusters to get the Press to blackout\r\n\r\nthe  speeches  or the activities of the Opposition  is\r\n\r\nnot  true. But we certainly mean it when we  say  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has a right to approach  newsmen-I  do\r\n\r\nnot  mean  Communist newspapermen, but I do mean  both\r\n\r\nforeign and local correspondents - have a chit chat with\r\n\r\nthem and say, \"Your comments on this were quite wrong.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, this is what I think it should be.\" They may\r\n\r\naccept  it;  they  may reject it. But certainly,  Sir,\r\n\r\ndemocratic  freedom does not mean that the  Government\r\n\r\nmust  keep quiet and must not make its views known  to\r\n\r\nnewspapermen or people who work in the radio.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase of the radio, it is a Government department.

I think\r\n\r\nyou  misunderstood it.\" But the democratic  test,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is this: after having done that, if  the\r\n\r\nPress still continues not to support the Minister  and\r\n\r\nattacks  him  on his policy - that is the  real  testing\r\n\r\ntime - what would the Minister do in such a situation?\r\n\r\nIf  he keeps quiet and says, \"Well, I will defend your\r\n\r\nright  to  criticise  me,\" then  he  is  a  democratic\r\n\r\nMinister.  But  if he feels hurt, goes  into  a  huff,\r\n\r\ncalls  the Press up, and then gives it what he  thinks\r\n\r\nit  deserves,  then he is not doing the  right  thing.\r\n\r\nThat  is  what we are complaining about. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as has been\r\n\r\nmentioned before, the phrase \"against the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  State\" is quite a loose phrase. For instance,  an\r\n\r\nanti-P.A.P. report can easily be  stretched  to  mean\r\n\r\nanti-Government, because the P.A.P. happens to  be  in\r\n\r\nthe   Government;   and,  of  course,  anti-Government\r\n\r\nreports can be said to be against the interest of  the\r\n\r\nState,  Talking about knuckle-dusters, slapping, \r\n\r\narm-twisting, and all that - you do not need all that,  Sir,\r\n\r\nto  exert  control. I think the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nespecially will bear me out when I say that the modern\r\n\r\nmethod of teaching and educating people is not by\r\n\r\narm-twisting.  Teachers  control  their  classes   without\r\n\r\nhaving  to  twist the children's arms. Is it necessary\r\n\r\nto  summon the pressmen before each publication? It is\r\n\r\nalso  not necessary to limit the space or time of  the\r\n\r\nreports.   Just  now  the  Minister  himself  admitted\r\n\r\ncalling  the pressmen one day and, let us  say,  paved\r\n\r\nthe way in establishing the atmosphere and the tune in\r\n\r\nwhich his report should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade.  Sir,  a seemingly innocent and harmless  but  a\r\n\r\nwell calculated tip from the Minister to the Press  is\r\n\r\nquite  different and is not comparable with a protest,\r\n\r\nno  matter  how vigorous, from the Opposition  or  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public. I do not think I need go  into\r\n\r\ndetails  about this because it is too obvious and  too\r\n\r\napparent.  It  would  be  an  insult,  Sir,   to   the\r\n\r\nintelligence and the capability of the members of  the\r\n\r\nPress  to say that they need detailed suggestions  and\r\n\r\ninstructions in each instance. Surely they are capable\r\n\r\nof  carrying out an overall and general instruction on\r\n\r\nprinciples  that  hold good at all times  and  in  all\r\n\r\nmatters.  But  a seemingly friendly and  harmless  but\r\n\r\nwell calculated tip from the Minister is sufficient to\r\n\r\nmake  the Press understand that they should take heed,\r\n\r\nor else-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts to wipe out Opposition views is\r\n\r\nclearly seen not only in the Press and radio but  also\r\n\r\nin  the  bulletins  that Government  issue  at  public\r\n\r\nexpense.  In  other  democratic  countries,  bulletins\r\n\r\nissued  by Government at public expense give both  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the  Government  and  the  Opposition.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, here is one from America, when Mr Nixon was\r\n\r\nin the Government, in which both Mr Kennedy's and Mr\r\n\r\nNixon's views are given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While talking about Government bulletins, I wonder\r\n\r\nif  the  Hon. the Minister for Culture could  tell  us\r\n\r\nwhether  there  is any significance in putting  a  big\r\n\r\nchop  on  a picture showing the Prime Minister shaking\r\n\r\nhands  with  Mr Lim Chin Siong. I ask this.  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nview  of all that has been said in this House  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill about the gentleman concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I did not intend to enter into\r\n\r\nthis  debate, Mr Speaker, Sir, but it strikes me that\r\n\r\nthe  whole level of the discussion emanating from  the\r\n\r\nOpposition is so puerile that-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know why at this late\r\n\r\nhour the Minister for Finance is starting to embark on\r\n\r\nunparliamentary words. Let us try and keep this debate\r\n\r\nin as adult a manner as we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The impression that I intended to\r\n\r\nconvey, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that the argument used by\r\n\r\nthe   Opposition  would  disgrace  even   any   debate\r\n\r\nconducted by the Fifth Form in our local schools. They\r\n\r\ntried to put out the idea that the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nis  exercising  some form of subtle control  over  the\r\n\r\nPress. All Governments in any democratic country  have\r\n\r\nrelations with the Press, and it is their right to see\r\n\r\nthat  their views are fairly represented. Where  there\r\n\r\nhas  been misreporting, it is right for the Government\r\n\r\nto  make representation to the papers concerned.  That\r\n\r\nright they have conceded, but in no instance have they\r\n\r\nbrought  any evidence to show that we have  done  more\r\n\r\nthan  this.  In the one case where a Member  from  the\r\n\r\nOpposition tried to give some evidence, he was  caught\r\n\r\non  the  wrong  foot immediately by you, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir. The test of whether the Press is free is a simple\r\n\r\none. Has this Government closed down any newspaper  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   on  the  ground  that  it  had  criticised\r\n\r\nGovernment  policy? Can the Opposition name  one  such\r\n\r\ninstance?  So  it is obvious that what the  Opposition\r\n\r\nare  really worried is that, by and large, the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  has had a good Press. And may  I  suggest.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, that the reason could  possibly  be\r\n\r\nthat  we have governed well. The Opposition have  also\r\n\r\nexpressed  dissatisfaction that their views  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  given  sufficient publicity in the Press.  Again\r\n\r\nthe  explanation could well be that if they had talked\r\n\r\nmore  sense, the Press might have printed a  lot  more\r\n\r\nthan they had done of what the Opposition had said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on this particular\r\n\r\nquestion  of Press freedom, I got the impression  that\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  were just like  blind  men  who  were\r\n\r\ngroping in a dark room for a hen which was not  there.\r\n\r\nSo we have this impression of their going through the\r\n\r\nmotion  of  suggesting that there is  something  there\r\n\r\nwhen  it  is  not  there. In fact, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  asked  what papers had been closed  down.  We\r\n\r\nhave  closed down a few papers - the Week-Ender,  a  few\r\n\r\nmosquito  papers.  In  what  way  have  we  tried   to\r\n\r\nintimidate  the  Press?  The  Member  for  Mountbatten\r\n\r\ntalked  vaguely  of intimidation and so  on.  She  got\r\n\r\nworked up,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  she  is  really trying to win the  favour  of  the\r\n\r\npressmen,  she is going about it in the wrong  way.  I\r\n\r\nknow  pressmen. One thing they resent  is  being  told\r\n\r\nthat  they  are stooges of somebody else. If  this  is\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Members have been indulging in, I  am  very\r\n\r\nsorry  if  tomorrow they get a poorer showing  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  than  what  they have  got  in  the  past,\r\n\r\nbecause,  as a newspaperman myself, I know  there  are\r\n\r\nways  of  winning over newspaper people, and the  best\r\n\r\nway is not to suggest that they are stooges, which  is\r\n\r\nwhat has been happening here for the last one hour.  I\r\n\r\nam not supposed to look up there, Sir, I am looking at\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition! Perhaps I can give a word of  advice.\r\n\r\nIf the Opposition want to get a better press, let them\r\n\r\nsay  some bright things. Let them say some intelligent\r\n\r\nthings.  I  am  quite sure it would be very  difficult\r\n\r\neven  for  the  Minister for Culture  to  prevent  the\r\n\r\nPress, which is a competitive one, from publishing it.\r\n\r\nThey  have  to  sell  their newspapers.  If  there  is\r\n\r\nsomething worth-while, they will publish it.  If  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers feel that they have been at a disadvantage for\r\n\r\nthe last eighteen months, I do not mind giving them  a\r\n\r\nfew  hints  in  private on how to  win  and  influence\r\n\r\nnewspapermen without twisting their arms  and  without\r\n\r\nhaving to insult them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is this, Sir. The Government has\r\n\r\ncertainly to intervene in certain cases (which I think\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Farrer Park has outlined)  when  they\r\n\r\naffect  the basic structure of our society. If we  all\r\n\r\naccept the democratic system, to that extent, we  have\r\n\r\nthe  right, in the present situation, to intervene  to\r\n\r\nsee  that that basic structure which we all accept  is\r\n\r\nnot   destroyed.  If  somebody  says  that  it  is   a\r\n\r\ntransgression - in theory yes, it is a transgression  of\r\n\r\nabsolute  freedom. If a newspaper indulges in  tactics\r\n\r\nwhich  might incite communal hatred or race riots,  we\r\n\r\nwill intervene. In fact, during the last one year,  we\r\n\r\nhave  had  occasion to ring up the Press and  ask  for\r\n\r\ntheir  co-operation to keep certain unpleasant stories\r\n\r\nout  of the Press. In fact, we know that a failure  to\r\n\r\ndo  that-not  by the past Government, but  some  years\r\n\r\nago - resulted in the loss of many lives. When you  talk\r\n\r\nof national interest, it is not the interest of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government because we can, whether we  are  or\r\n\r\nare  not the Government, get much more space than  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  can ever get. But it is not to defend  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  But  when  we think that the interest  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  as a whole is involved, then, to that extent,\r\n\r\nwe  are quite prepared to modify the absolute freedom,\r\n\r\nwhich  nobody  accepts, not even in Britain.  To  that\r\n\r\nextent, Sir, we concede that we do interfere with  the\r\n\r\nPress. But where it means interference with the  Press\r\n\r\nto  blackout  the Opposition. I think that  is  false,\r\n\r\nbecause  a  good newspaper man works on a very  simple\r\n\r\nprinciple-print all the news that is fit to print.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may go back\r\n\r\nagain  to  Radio  Singapore.  Although  we  have  been\r\n\r\ndiscussing  for  quite some time  certain  aspects  of\r\n\r\nRadio  Singapore, we have not really touched upon  one\r\n\r\nside  of its functions, that is, the Malay programmes.\r\n\r\nI  would  suggest to the Minister concerned to  listen\r\n\r\nmore  carefully to the programmes that  are  emanating\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Malay section of Radio Singapore.  For  one\r\n\r\nthing, the jokes which come out from the Malay section\r\n\r\nof Radio Singapore are very filthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is about certain lectures which are\r\n\r\nbroadcast  by  the  Malay section of Radio  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  was  one  the other day on family  planning.  I\r\n\r\nheard  it, and my children heard it. Some of the words\r\n\r\nused by the Malay section of Radio Singapore, again if\r\n\r\nI  may say so, are filthy. One of the expressions used\r\n\r\nwas  \"ayer mani\", that is, semen. So my little  child,\r\n\r\nwho is only four years old, came up to me and asked me\r\n\r\nwhat it was. I think this sort of thing should not  be\r\n\r\nbroadcast over Radio Singapore, particularly when  the\r\n\r\nradio  is  available to our little children.  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  the Minister to look more carefully  into\r\n\r\nthe Malay programmes of Radio Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to touch upon is\r\n\r\nfreedom of the Press. We have been wasting quite  some\r\n\r\ntime  on this subject. Not only today but probably  at\r\n\r\nevery sitting of this Assembly, this subject has  been\r\n\r\ntouched  upon. We say that the Press is not free.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsays  that the Press is free. So I think that the test\r\n\r\nof the whole matter is for the newspapers concerned to\r\n\r\nsay  whether they are free or not. I would, therefore,\r\n\r\nsuggest, Sir, to all the Press in Singapore to issue a\r\n\r\nstatement  tomorrow and say whether they are  free  or\r\n\r\nnot.  If  they will not say anything, that means  that\r\n\r\nthey are not free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, we have only a few minutes\r\n\r\nleft. The Opposition is not accusing the Government of\r\n\r\nopen  intimidation. We do not say  that  we  want  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  tell  the  Press  to  give   us   more\r\n\r\npublicity,  because we do not require that.  But  then\r\n\r\nthe  Government  says  that we  are  saying  that  the\r\n\r\nreporters  are stooges of the Government. We  did  not\r\n\r\nsay  so.  We are saying that there has been suggestive\r\n\r\nintimidation. Well, the Government says one thing  and\r\n\r\nwe  say  another; so the best people to  know  whether\r\n\r\nthere has been or has not been freedom of the Press is\r\n\r\nthe public, and we leave it to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is one point perhaps the\r\n\r\nMinister  might want to answer.

To  form  this\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade  speedily  and  without  any  inordinate\r\n\r\nexpense, it was necessary to divert the energies of  a\r\n\r\ncertain existing organisation from its current task so\r\n\r\nthat  the  proper personnel could be diverted  towards\r\n\r\nthe  organisation and administration of  the  Brigade.\r\n\r\nThis token vote of $10 merely shows that although  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government is not making use of  the  Civil\r\n\r\nDefence Department at the present moment, it is  still\r\n\r\nkeeping the department available so that if it  should\r\n\r\nprove  necessary  for Government to make  use  of  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Defence  Department in an emergency, then  the\r\n\r\nvote will be available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this department is a\r\n\r\nhighly trained department, as I understand it. It is a\r\n\r\nhighly  specialised department and, after  having  had\r\n\r\nall  this  special training, it is now being  used  in\r\n\r\nrunning   some  might  say  a  slave  camp,  but   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  says a labour camp. It seems  to  me,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that all this trained personnel is being\r\n\r\nwasted  on  the Work Brigade, the personnel  for  whom\r\n\r\ncould quite easily be recruited from outside. All that\r\n\r\nis  required  is  a sergeant major with  a  stentorian\r\n\r\nvoice.  I  am sure the P.A.P. could quite easily  find\r\n\r\nthose  people  without much difficulty. To  use  these\r\n\r\nhighly  trained  officers to do  that,  I  think,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is a waste of public funds. That is  the\r\n\r\nfirst point. The second point is that, while they  are\r\n\r\ndoing  that  job, they are losing the  practice  which\r\n\r\nthey should be continuously receiving in respect of  a\r\n\r\nhighly important civic service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On the contrary, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Civil Defence Department  personnel  are\r\n\r\nhighly  trained personnel that they have been diverted\r\n\r\nto  help  the  Work  Brigade in the training  and  the\r\n\r\nhandling  of men and materials. This job really  needs\r\n\r\nsomebody  trained  in  the way  that  they  have  been\r\n\r\ntrained.  If the Government had to get new  people  in\r\n\r\norder   to   handle  the  Work  Brigade,  then   extra\r\n\r\nexpenditure would have been involved. On top of  that,\r\n\r\nat the present moment, there is no visible need for  a\r\n\r\nCivil  Defence  Department  working  towards  specific\r\n\r\nobjectives  in civil defence. It is only  killing  two\r\n\r\nbirds  with one stone that the Government has diverted\r\n\r\nthe  trained personnel of the Civil Defence  Corps  to\r\n\r\nthe Work Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $8,363,710 for Head 50 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 53 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 53 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a category of people in Singapore who\r\n\r\nare   citizens  and  yet,  for  the  purposes  of  the\r\n\r\nImmigration   and   Passports  Department,   are   not\r\n\r\nconsidered  as  citizens. I refer, Sir,  to  the  vast\r\n\r\nnumber  of  middle-age people who,  although  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   are   unable  to  produce   their   birth\r\n\r\ncertificates. Their age group falls in the over  40's,\r\n\r\nthat  is  to  say,  born before 1920.  They  have,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  their identity cards issued to them 12  years\r\n\r\nago,  in  1948,  indicating that  they  were  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. At the time of the issue of their  identity\r\n\r\ncards,  there was no inkling of Singapore citizenship.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, because they were born in Singapore they did\r\n\r\nnot  apply  for Singapore citizenship,  since  by  the\r\n\r\noperation of law, they are automatically recognised as\r\n\r\ncitizens,  and  by the same process their  names  were\r\n\r\nautomatically also included in the electoral register.\r\n\r\nDuring  the last elections they exercised their  right\r\n\r\nto  vote. And yet, Sir, when it comes to the issue  of\r\n\r\npassports,  they  are  asked to  produce  their  birth\r\n\r\ncertificates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand this requirement is not only confined\r\n\r\nto the Passport Office, but in some instances, also to\r\n\r\nthe  Social  Welfare Department when public assistance\r\n\r\nis  sought;  and  in a few rare cases,  the  Education\r\n\r\nDepartment  where  some  principals  insist   on   the\r\n\r\nproduction  of  the birth certificates of  parents  to\r\n\r\ndetermine their citizenship before free education  can\r\n\r\nbe given to their children. The production of identity\r\n\r\ncards  is  not enough, although these were issued  way\r\n\r\nback in 1948.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Sir, these unfortunate people are\r\n\r\ncitizens  for  the purposes of election, because  they\r\n\r\ncan  and have voted, and yet are not citizens when  it\r\n\r\ncomes to demanding their other rights as citizens.  If\r\n\r\nGovernment is going to take that line, then I think  a\r\n\r\ndangerous  situation  would arise.  If  they  are  not\r\n\r\ncitizens,  then they should not vote; but  since  they\r\n\r\nhave  voted, what would be the position of the Members\r\n\r\nof this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembly,  they having been elected by  an  electorate\r\n\r\nwhich included people who are not citizens?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My estimates, Sir, is that there are between 50,000\r\n\r\nand 60,000 people in this category. I wonder, Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  could give an assurance that  ho  would\r\n\r\nlook into this inconsistent application of the law.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  anomaly can be rectified administratively,\r\n\r\nand I do not think there is any necessity to amend the\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this problem,\r\n\r\nin   fact,  has  been  occupying  the  minds  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai must be aware; that, at\r\n\r\nthe  time  when  the identity cards  were  issued  (in\r\n\r\n1948),  it was done in a very haphazard manner and  no\r\n\r\ninvestigation whatsoever was made to ascertain whether\r\n\r\nthe  applicant  for  an  identity  card  was  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore or elsewhere, with the result that  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of identity card holders who were not born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  were  shown as born in Singapore  on  their\r\n\r\nidentity   cards.  With  the  introduction   of   the\r\n\r\nautomatic registration of electors, the names of these\r\n\r\nidentity  card holders who were not born in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwere  also entered in the electoral register  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes of election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we can accept this position. A wrong\r\n\r\nshould not be perpetuated. In fact, the Government  is\r\n\r\nnow  looking  into this question in  relation  to  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  new  plastic identity cards in  the  coming\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these people\r\n\r\nwith  identity cards, although they do not have  birth\r\n\r\ncertificates   to  prove  their  birth,   could   have\r\n\r\nregistered as citizens of Singapore if they  had  been\r\n\r\ntold to do so. The fact that it was mentioned that  it\r\n\r\nwas  not  necessary for people who  claimed  birth  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  be  registered made it unnecessary  for\r\n\r\nthem to go through the process of registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people who were not born in Singapore, say in\r\n\r\n1958, could become citizens of Singapore by the mere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprocess  of signing their names and taking an oath  of\r\n\r\nloyalty, then surely these people with identity  cards\r\n\r\nare  qualified  to be citizens too. If they  had  been\r\n\r\ntold  at  that  time,  then  they  would  have  become\r\n\r\ncitizens by registration instead of citizens by birth.\r\n\r\nTo  say that they have no birth certificates to  prove\r\n\r\ntheir  birth, and therefore they are not citizens  and\r\n\r\nthat   they   have  to  go  through  the  process   of\r\n\r\nregistration  again is to declare that  they  are  not\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore as yet. If the Government  were\r\n\r\nto  take that line, it would mean that these 50,000 to\r\n\r\n60,000 people had voted against the law and that  they\r\n\r\nshould  not have been put on the electoral  roll.  Who\r\n\r\nknows whether these 50,000 to 60,000 people might have\r\n\r\nput the P.A.P. into power?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill should, bear the responsibility\r\n\r\nfor  all this confusion, because the citizenship  laws\r\n\r\ncame  into  being in his time. It was  his  Government\r\n\r\nthat  advised those who were born in Singapore not  to\r\n\r\napply for citizenship. I remember that the law had  to\r\n\r\nbe  amended subsequently to make provision  for  those\r\n\r\nwho  were  born  in  Singapore but could  not  produce\r\n\r\nevidence of their birth in Singapore. In fact, at  the\r\n\r\nmoment, as a practice, we always advise those who have\r\n\r\nno evidence of birth whatsoever to apply for Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship before they apply for Singapore passports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if that is the\r\n\r\nonly advice the Minister can give, I think it will not\r\n\r\nbe  enough,  because it will only affect those  people\r\n\r\nwho  apply for passports. But what about those  people\r\n\r\nwho are not applying for passports?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the colonial days - long before the days\r\n\r\nof  the  previous Government - it was easy to  obtain  a\r\n\r\npassport if a man said he was born in Singapore but he\r\n\r\ncould  not produce a birth certificate. All he  needed\r\n\r\nto  do was to get an elderly gentleman or a lady older\r\n\r\nthan  he was to go to the Supreme Court to take out  a\r\n\r\nstatutory declaration saying that that person was born\r\n\r\nin Singapore. That statutory declaration was accepted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the Passport Office. Could the Minister assure the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  a  similar process will  be  accepted  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  these people not only for  the  issue  of\r\n\r\npassports  but  also for other requirements - for  other\r\n\r\nrequirements of Government departments?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Just now the Member for Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai said \"there is a large number of people who were\r\n\r\nborn    in   Singapore\" - he   called   them   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens - \"who  are  unable  to  produce  their   birth\r\n\r\ncertificates\".  It is very simple:  if  they  want  to\r\n\r\nproduce proof that they were really born in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthere are many ways of doing so. For example, if  they\r\n\r\nare   Christians,  they  can  produce  their   baptism\r\n\r\ncertificates.   Or  they  could  produce   the   birth\r\n\r\ncertificates  of their brothers and sisters  who  were\r\n\r\nborn  round  about the time they were born,  to  prove\r\n\r\nthat  their  parents were then in Singapore.  Or  they\r\n\r\ncould  have their school leaving certificates to prove\r\n\r\nthat  they were in school in Singapore. Or they  could\r\n\r\nhave travel documents to prove that their parents came\r\n\r\nhere  not  long  before  they  were  born.  All  these\r\n\r\ndocuments  could be produced if these people  want  to\r\n\r\nprove that they were barn in Singapore. If they cannot\r\n\r\nproduce them, then it will be very difficult to  prove\r\n\r\ntheir birth in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the statutory declarations of the past\r\n\r\nbeing  accepted, we know so many things did happen  in\r\n\r\nthe  past; but, Sir, it is not the business of a  good\r\n\r\ngovernment to accept things which are not good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in other words,\r\n\r\nthe   Government   will  not  accept   any   statutory\r\n\r\ndeclaration.

But  what  about\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  non-Christians? Not all  Chinese  are\r\n\r\nChristians  and,  of  course,  all  Malays   are   not\r\n\r\nChristians. What about them?

I remember when\r\n\r\nthe  citizenship law was put into operation, I applied\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  citizenship,  and  I  had  to  go  for\r\n\r\nregistration.   Many   people  registered   themselves\r\n\r\nwithout saying whether they had any birth certificate.\r\n\r\nThey  were  told that they need not have to  apply.

But, Sir,  in\r\n\r\nthe case of citizens of Singapore who were not born in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  what  they  have  to  produce  is  just  a\r\n\r\ncitizenship certificate; it is a simple matter.

Even if it could not be accepted as a fact,  it\r\n\r\ncould  be  accepted as a substitute for an application\r\n\r\nfor  registration  as a Citizen in 1958.

I am  a\r\n\r\nregistered citizen, and if the Minister did not  `like\r\n\r\nmy  face  or if I spoke too much and out of turn,  and\r\n\r\nnot  in the national interest, he could deprive me  of\r\n\r\nmy  citizenship. But had I been born in Singapore, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  could  talk as much as  I  like  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  would not be able to do anything  about  it.\r\n\r\nThat is the point of difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if a man was born in Singapore but\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  because he cannot  produce  his  birth\r\n\r\ncertificate, the Minister is asking him to forego  his\r\n\r\ninalienable rights in order to suit a certain practice\r\n\r\nin  his  Immigration Department. The point  at  issue\r\n\r\nreally  is - and  I am suggesting it to the  Minister - is\r\n\r\nthis  man trying to get an advantage for himself which\r\n\r\nhe  should not get? The facts of the situation in such\r\n\r\ncases  are  that he is not, because when the  identity\r\n\r\ncard  was  issued to him in 1948, nobody at that  time\r\n\r\nhad the foresight to see that citizenship was going to\r\n\r\ncome to Singapore. He told the truth. In 99 cases  out\r\n\r\nof  100,  Mr Speaker, I am suggesting to the Minister\r\n\r\nthat  the people told the truth. Now, in one odd case,\r\n\r\nmaybe he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntold  an untruth, by mistake or deliberately. But even\r\n\r\nin  that deliberate case, he could have - there  was  no\r\n\r\npoint  in his lying - gone and said, \"I was not born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.    I   have   the   necessary   residential\r\n\r\nqualifications\",  and  they would  have  given  him  a\r\n\r\ncertificate of registration as a citizen. That was the\r\n\r\nposition  in  those days. Even there, the  reason  for\r\n\r\nlying  disappears. So the Immigration Department says,\r\n\r\n\"Right.   Prove   your  birth.  Produce   your   birth\r\n\r\ncertificate, and then we will give you a passport.  If\r\n\r\nyou cannot produce your birth certificate, then you go\r\n\r\nand  become  a citizen.\" Well, he becomes a registered\r\n\r\ncitizen;  he is not a natural-born Singapore  citizen.\r\n\r\nHe is a registered citizen. His rights are altered.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  see  why  the  person  who  has  an  inherent\r\n\r\ninalienable  right  to citizenship,  which  gives  him\r\n\r\ncomplete  rights as a citizen and not a  99  per  cent\r\n\r\nright  as a Singapore citizen where the Minister could\r\n\r\nrevoke  his  citizenship, should sell  his  birthright\r\n\r\nbecause   it   suits  the  convenience   of   Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The real crux of the problem\r\n\r\nwhich  they have all the time been harping on is proof\r\n\r\nof  identity, proof of citizenship, and proof of birth\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. If a person can prove that he was  born\r\n\r\nin Singapore, there need be no talk of citizenship. If\r\n\r\nhe wants to talk of citizenship by registration, then,\r\n\r\nof  course,  he  has to prove also  that  he  has  the\r\n\r\nqualifications in order that he can register.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, there is another point.

Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  will remember that there is provision  in\r\n\r\nthe  citizenship  laws that if  a  person's  birth  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  accepted, he will be  registered  as  a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen under that relevant section, and his\r\n\r\ncitizenship cannot be revoked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think the real difficulty in this\r\n\r\nmatter  lies  simply  in the fact  that  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials  in  connection with the issue of  passports\r\n\r\nare  somewhat  lazy - I mean that in all seriousness - and\r\n\r\nare not going out of their way to help the citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, normally when a person swears a\r\n\r\nstatutory  declaration, this is the form the statutory\r\n\r\ndeclaration will take: \"I was present when this person\r\n\r\nwas  born. I saw his birth. He has lived in that house\r\n\r\n...  \"-that  is the form of the statutory declaration.\r\n\r\nAny  other declaration is not worth the paper on which\r\n\r\nit  is sworn. Now, if two persons swear a declaration,\r\n\r\nthen  it is prima facie evidence that that is correct.\r\n\r\nNaturally the Ministry officials must investigate. But\r\n\r\nthis  is where the difficulty occurs, Mr Speaker - they\r\n\r\ndo  not.  They  just  say, \"We  will  not  accept  any\r\n\r\nstatutory  declaration like that.\" That is not  right.\r\n\r\nAfter all, when a person uses the due processes of the\r\n\r\nlaw, one must assume that he is being honest. One must\r\n\r\nnot assume that he is dishonest. That is what Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials   are  assuming!  Everybody  who   makes   a\r\n\r\nstatutory declaration is a dishonest chap. There is  a\r\n\r\npremium on dishonesty in Singapore, it seems! Why must\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  officials assume that?  That  statutory\r\n\r\ndeclaration is made. Naturally they need not  give  in\r\n\r\nto  the  declaration like that, Mr Speaker.  I  think\r\n\r\nthey  are  in duty bound on the production of  such  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  declaration on oath to cause investigations\r\n\r\nto  be made.

Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 54 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with regard to Head 54 - Police. I would like to get complete clarification from the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned,  because  this  matter  has  been\r\n\r\ndiscussed on a number of occasions in the past.  After\r\n\r\na  lapse  of 18 months, the time has come  for  me  to\r\n\r\nenquire  what  is the present position of  the  police\r\n\r\nforce  as a whole. According to the Police Report  for\r\n\r\n1959 - I  do not know the position for 1960 - the  members\r\n\r\nof  the  Police Force consist of the following: Malays\r\n\r\n22  per  cent; Chinese section 19 per cent,  and  some\r\n\r\nothers.  During the past few days, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhad   said  that  there  are  proposals  to  give   an\r\n\r\nopportunity to the Malays in the police force, one of\r\n\r\nwhich is a cadet scheme. I should like to be told  the\r\n\r\npercentage  of the personnel mentioned.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\ncompared   with  the  figures  I  have  just   quoted,\r\n\r\naccording to the report, of the regular officers, only\r\n\r\n8  per cent comprises the Malay community, and 44  per\r\n\r\ncent  consists of Chinese, while 48 per cent comprises\r\n\r\nothers.  As  regards the regular officers - the  higher\r\n\r\nechelons - a  specific qualification  is  required.  But\r\n\r\nwhat I am sorry to note is the position with regard to\r\n\r\nthe   regular  inspectors.  In  Singapore  the   Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity   represents  11  per  cent;   the   Chinese\r\n\r\nrepresent  50  per  cent - almost  half - and  the  others\r\n\r\nrepresent 39 per cent. Mr Speaker, in order to have a\r\n\r\nbalance  in the administration of the police force,  I\r\n\r\nwholly  support the principle that new recruits should\r\n\r\nbe  engaged  from non-Malays, especially the  Chinese,\r\n\r\nbecause  in  Singapore the majority  consists  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese population. But, Mr Speaker, I would like  to\r\n\r\nexplain  that the proposal as mentioned by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has not been implemented in full. I fear that\r\n\r\nthe  reason  for this is the lack of encouragement  to\r\n\r\npeople  who  should deserve to hold  such  posts.  The\r\n\r\npolice, as an instrument of the State, has to maintain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecurity  not  only against Communist  subversion  but\r\n\r\nalso  against  gangsterism  and  other  crimes.  So  I\r\n\r\nsubmit, in my opinion, that there are members  of  the\r\n\r\npolice force who are dissatisfied with the question of\r\n\r\npromotion.  This will no doubt result in the  lack  of\r\n\r\nconfidence  in the police force as a whole,  and  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  be able to discharge their duties,  because\r\n\r\nthere is no understanding between one another, and the\r\n\r\nefficiency of the services will be reduced somewhat. I\r\n\r\nwould like a reply from the Minister concerned on  the\r\n\r\nseveral points I have put forward just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, I would also like to get\r\n\r\nclarification from the Minister concerned  whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  Darjah  VII  qualification is  accepted  for  the\r\n\r\npolice recruits this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the problem\r\n\r\nposed by the Member for Kampong Kembangan is not  new.\r\n\r\nNor  is this problem caused by the present Government.\r\n\r\nWe  inherited  a  police force with all  its  problems\r\n\r\nalready   in  existence.  The  higher  proportion   of\r\n\r\ngazetted  officers  were non-Malays  and  the  greater\r\n\r\nproportion  of  the  rank and file  were  Malays.  But\r\n\r\nsurely the Member for Kampong Kembangan should realise\r\n\r\nthat  this  was  the result caused by  the  system  of\r\n\r\neducation  in the past where the Malays, as  a  whole,\r\n\r\nhad  not  been given the opportunity to obtain  higher\r\n\r\neducation.  What  the Prime Minister mentioned  a  few\r\n\r\ndays  ago  was  the implementation of the Commissioner\r\n\r\ncadet  scheme, whereby annually a number  of  suitable\r\n\r\ncandidates  from  the rank and file are  selected  for\r\n\r\ntraining  to  prepare them for the School  Certificate\r\n\r\nexamination,   which  is  the  minimum   qualification\r\n\r\nrequired for appointment as inspectors. They are given\r\n\r\nnot  more  than five years to prepare for  the  School\r\n\r\nCertificate examination, and if they pass,  they  will\r\n\r\nbe  considered for promotion to the rank of Inspector.\r\n\r\nThis  scheme  has been carried on during  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In  1959, five Commissioner  cadets  were\r\n\r\nselected and sent for study. In fact, in 1959, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecided that in future this Commissioner cadet  scheme\r\n\r\nshould only be confined to Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the qualification for entry into the police\r\n\r\nforce,  I  wish  to  remind  the  Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  that the qualification for entry  into  the\r\n\r\npolice  force  was fixed in 1951. If  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan thinks that this  qualification  is\r\n\r\ntoo high, then I might inform him that during the last\r\n\r\nGovernment,  when his colleague was a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nCabinet,  he  had  not  done anything  to  change  the\r\n\r\nqualification.  We  have,  in  fact,  considered  this\r\n\r\nproblem  of entry qualification into the police  force\r\n\r\nfor  Malays early this year. A decision has been  made\r\n\r\nto  change  the qualification from two  years  in  the\r\n\r\nSultan Idris Training College to Form 3 Malay,  to  be\r\n\r\nin  line with the English qualification. This will  be\r\n\r\nimplemented in the coming year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also under consideration at the same time\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of a Force Entrance examination  for\r\n\r\nthose  Malay  candidates who have  no  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nstudy  in  Form 3 Malay class. The Member for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  must  be aware that until the  standard  of\r\n\r\neducation  of  the  Malays  has  been  raised  to  the\r\n\r\nrequired  standard, the proportion of  Malay  gazetted\r\n\r\nofficers, cannot  increase to an appreciable  extent.\r\n\r\nWhat  we can do is to offer those who are already  in\r\n\r\nthe  force  scholarships under the Commissioner  cadet\r\n\r\nscheme  to  advance  themselves, so  that  they  could\r\n\r\nobtain higher qualification for promotion to inspector\r\n\r\nrank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

As I have said earlier, the  Minister  was\r\n\r\nelected  by  the  people. He  himself  came  from  the\r\n\r\npeople. We should explore all avenues to increase  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of officers for the Commissioner cadet scheme.\r\n\r\nI  am quite sure that this is not beyond the means  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister. The expenditure involved is not  great,\r\n\r\nand  it  will  receive  the  support  of  all  parties\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, in fact, I\r\n\r\nhave  been  trying to show to the Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan just now the difference between the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  past  colonial  Government.  The\r\n\r\ncolonial Government had in the past completely ignored\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the Malays. They had never paid  any\r\n\r\nattention  to  Malay education or to  improving  their\r\n\r\nstatus.  The  present Government has set up,  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst time, a Malay secondary school, so that in  time\r\n\r\nto  come  those who graduate from this school will  be\r\n\r\nable to compete equally with those who pass the School\r\n\r\nCertificate  Examination  or  the  Senior  Middle  III\r\n\r\nChinese Examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  have offered free education to all Malays  in  the\r\n\r\nsecondary  school and the University.  These  are  the\r\n\r\nconcrete  steps that the present Government has  taken\r\n\r\ntowards raising the general level of education of  the\r\n\r\nMalays.  In addition to this, in so far as the  police\r\n\r\nforce  is  concerned, we have this Commissioner  cadet\r\n\r\nscheme  the purpose of which is to increase the number\r\n\r\nof  Malay officers in the force eligible for promotion\r\n\r\nto  the  Inspectorate. It is not a question  why  the\r\n\r\nnumber of Commissioner cadets cannot be increased from\r\n\r\n5  to  10.  In  fact,  we can send about  10  officers\r\n\r\nannually  for  training, and the fact that  only  five\r\n\r\nwere  sent  in  1959  was because we  could  not  find\r\n\r\nsuitable  candidates. The Member for Kampong Kembangan\r\n\r\nmust realise that not everybody can study, or has  the\r\n\r\naptitude  to study, especially those who have  already\r\n\r\nreached  the  age of 40 and above. I  can  assure  the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Kembangan that all promising  Malay\r\n\r\nofficers  will be given a chance to proceed  in  their\r\n\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Unfortunately, it has been assumed  that  the\r\n\r\nInspectors act as watchdogs of the Ministry.  I  think\r\n\r\nit is a most unfortunate impression which I have tried\r\n\r\nmy  best  to  correct,  because the  function  of  the\r\n\r\nInspectors  should  be  that  of  giving  advice   and\r\n\r\nassistance  not only to the principals of schools  but\r\n\r\nto teachers who may have problems which they face in a\r\n\r\nparticular  set of conditions. Perhaps teachers  in  a\r\n\r\nparticular  school  have not yet solved  the  problems\r\n\r\nwhich   have   already   been  successfully   resolved\r\n\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of vacancies, it will be\r\n\r\nnecessary to go back to the previous Budget in which a\r\n\r\nrequest  for  20  additional posts  were  called  for,\r\n\r\nbecause it was felt that with the tremendous expansion\r\n\r\nin  schools, adequate inspection had not been  carried\r\n\r\nout  by  the  officers of the Ministry. As  it  always\r\n\r\ntakes  some time to get people appointed,  we  had  to\r\n\r\nadopt  the  device of seconding senior  principals  of\r\n\r\nschools  to  the Ministry to officiate and assist  the\r\n\r\nInspectors of Schools, to attend to complaints and  so\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March this year, a circular was issued inviting\r\n\r\napplications  from all senior teachers and  principals\r\n\r\nfor appointment as substantive holders of the post. It\r\n\r\nhas  taken some time to process these applications.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  applications were  forwarded  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission in June and July this  year.\r\n\r\nIt depends on when the Public Service Commission would\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  interview  and  to  make  the  necessary\r\n\r\nappointments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I did not get the third question raised\r\n\r\nby the Member for Tanglin.

What is the number of heads of\r\n\r\nschools  and teachers who have been asked  to  act  in\r\n\r\nthese posts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think the answer to that would\r\n\r\nbe under 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nglad  indeed to hear from the Minister that  the  role\r\n\r\nof  Inspectors  of Schools should be  a  constructive\r\n\r\none.  When they visit the schools, their main  purpose\r\n\r\nshould  be to give the maximum assistance to them  and\r\n\r\nto   the   principals.  Unfortunately,  Sir,  in   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of that fine policy, I  regret  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  mistakes have been made and they have created  a\r\n\r\nvery  unhappy  impression in the  minds  of  heads  of\r\n\r\nschools  and teachers. I think if the Minister,  after\r\n\r\nhaving stated what the duties of Inspectors of Schools\r\n\r\nshould  be,  could  brief the Inspectorate  again,  it\r\n\r\nwould go a long way to improve the morale of heads  of\r\n\r\nschools and teachers and restore good relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the functions which the Minister has just\r\n\r\nreferred  to  in  passing, but which I understand  has\r\n\r\nbecome  the  main  function, is the  investigation  of\r\n\r\ncomplaints sent in by writers of anonymous letters.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand,  Sir, that these complaints  have  to  be\r\n\r\ninvestigated within 48 hours from the moment they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  handed  over  to the Inspectors of  Schools.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthese anonymous letters belong to the category of what\r\n\r\nmight be called \"yellow culture\", and if they are  not\r\n\r\nput  into  the  wastepaper basket,  then  they  should\r\n\r\nreally  be  sent to the Minister for Home Affairs  for\r\n\r\ninvestigation;  but  for action to  be  taken  on  the\r\n\r\ncomplaint of the writer of an anonymous letter who may\r\n\r\nhave  malicious motives, I think that creates  a  bad\r\n\r\nimpression among heads of schools and teachers. In one\r\n\r\ninstance,  an  Inspector came along and  said,  \"I  am\r\n\r\nsorry.  I  have  been  sent  here  to  investigate  an\r\n\r\nallegation  made in a letter sent anonymously  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.\" The principal naturally said, \"If it is  an\r\n\r\nanonymous letter, why should you be bothered  to  come\r\n\r\nhere?  That  letter  should be put in  the  wastepaper\r\n\r\nbasket  or it should be forwarded to the head  of  the\r\n\r\nschool for his investigation.\" But for an Inspector to\r\n\r\ncome   along   and   investigate   straightaway,   the\r\n\r\nassumption is that the head and teachers of the school\r\n\r\nare  guilty, and he therefore comes in the role of  an\r\n\r\nInspector from the C.I.D. to investigate. I  am  sorry\r\n\r\nto say that that was not an isolated case. In fact,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  a  great deal of  the  time  of  the\r\n\r\nInspectors  of  Schools is spent in going  round  from\r\n\r\nschool to school to investigate complaints sent in  by\r\n\r\nanonymous   writers.  Sir,  if  this  practice   is\r\n\r\nencouraged, there will be no end of anonymous letters,\r\n\r\nand  instead  of  the Inspectors of  Schools  spending\r\n\r\ntheir  time  to  assist schools  to  attain  a  higher\r\n\r\nstandard of efficiency, they will be doing this  nasty\r\n\r\nwork  which  I  am sure they themselves do  not  enjoy\r\n\r\ndoing.  Therefore,  Sir, I am  quite  happy  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has made a statement here to clear the  air,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  was  most  unhappy  when  I  heard   these\r\n\r\ncomplaints. These complaints were not founded on fact.\r\n\r\nI  checked on them. I hope, Sir, there will be  a  new\r\n\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I was surprised when I compared the\r\n\r\napproach  of some Inspectors of Schools with  that  of\r\n\r\nsome  Inspectors of Police. The latter adopted a  very\r\n\r\nconstructive  approach. They would come along  to  the\r\n\r\nheads  of  schools and say, \"We believe that you  have\r\n\r\nsome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblem  of  secret society gangsters trying  to  gain\r\n\r\ninfluence over some of your students and we want to be\r\n\r\nof help. Whenever you are in trouble, please give us a\r\n\r\nring.\"  That  sort of approach will help to  build  up\r\n\r\nmorale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that it be made known from now onwards\r\n\r\nthat if complaints are made by anonymous writers, they\r\n\r\nwill  be sent to the Minister for Home Affairs  to  be\r\n\r\ntreated  as  \"yellow  culture\"  for  investigation  or\r\n\r\nthrown  into  the  wastepaper  basket.  Sir,  if   the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  are justified and if the heads of  schools\r\n\r\nare  reliable people, the complainants can go straight\r\n\r\nto  the heads of schools. I am sure that the heads  of\r\n\r\nschools  will respect the trust that the parents  have\r\n\r\nin   them   and  will  treat  the  matter  as   highly\r\n\r\nconfidential.  It  grieved my  heart  to  notice  that\r\n\r\ninvestigations  were  carried  out  by  Inspectors  of\r\n\r\nSchools  based  on allegations sent in  by  anonymous\r\n\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid that the attitude taken by the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education  has also  impaired  relations\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Ministry  and the schools.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is not aware of what is happening, as  these\r\n\r\nthings  naturally do not easily reach  his  ears.  The\r\n\r\nheads  of schools are treated as if their time is  not\r\n\r\nprecious.  Sir,  many  of them  are  highly  paid  and\r\n\r\ninstead  of  their wasting time going to the  Ministry\r\n\r\njust  to  take  delivery of some  documents,  or  some\r\n\r\ncheques  of  small denominations, I  think  this  work\r\n\r\ncould be assigned to the school clerk. Time and again,\r\n\r\nletters are sent from the Ministry addressed to  heads\r\n\r\nof aided and Government schools with the words \"Please\r\n\r\ncall, and take delivery of ...\". One head said, \"I  am\r\n\r\nno  longer the head of the school; I am a peon.\"  Sir,\r\n\r\nin my case, I took the risk - knowing that the Minister\r\n\r\nwould  understand - of refusing to go. I simply  sent  a\r\n\r\nletter  saying, \"I hereby authorise so and so to  take\r\n\r\ndelivery.\"  Because my time could be better  spent  in\r\n\r\nthe  office on other important matters than to go  and\r\n\r\nqueue up to take delivery of something which could  be\r\n\r\nundertaken by my chief clerk. I took the risk, Sir. Of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse, according to Government procedure, they  could\r\n\r\nstill insist and say, \"We want the principal to attend\r\n\r\nbecause  the instruction is to him.\" But  I  know  the\r\n\r\nMinister   has   got  more  common   sense   than   to\r\n\r\nmisunderstand my action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another circular went round with this\r\n\r\ninstruction,  \"No  principal of a school  [that  means\r\n\r\nincluding   Raffles  Institution]  should  leave   the\r\n\r\npremises without permission from one of four people in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry.  But any teacher can leave  the  school\r\n\r\npremises  with the permission of the head.\" Sir,  just\r\n\r\nthink,  if a principal is treated like that, it  means\r\n\r\nthat  he  is no longer a dependable man. If  he  is  a\r\n\r\ntrusted   man,  surely  when  he  leaves  the   school\r\n\r\npremises, he must be on school duty. But he has to ask\r\n\r\nfor  permission. He is then no longer a trusted  head.\r\n\r\nHe  is  even put in a position inferior to that  of  a\r\n\r\nschool  teacher, because the latter can just  ask  for\r\n\r\npermission  from his head, but the head must  ask  for\r\n\r\npermission from one of four Ministry officials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another thing is this. Maybe this has not\r\n\r\nreached  the ears of the Minister. According  to  some\r\n\r\ninstructions given, no teacher and no head of a school\r\n\r\ncan   leave   the  State  of  Singapore  without   the\r\n\r\npermission  of  the  Ministry. So whenever  a  teacher\r\n\r\nwants  to  leave Singapore, we have to send  a  letter\r\n\r\nrequesting  permission. In the past,  the  head  could\r\n\r\ngive  permission to the teacher because he would  know\r\n\r\nwhether he would need to have him on a certain day. So\r\n\r\none  teacher  said,  \"I want to visit  Johore  with  a\r\n\r\nfriend-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd.

Because if I were to give that permission,\r\n\r\nthat  would be ultra vires. I had no power to do  that\r\n\r\nsince  there had been a previous circular saying  that\r\n\r\npermission  must  be obtained.
