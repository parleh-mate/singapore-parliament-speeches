With the coming of the North-east Monsoon\r\n\r\nand the promise of more rain.

There is a lesson to  be\r\n\r\nlearnt  from the devastating effects of the unexpected\r\n\r\ndrought  in  Europe  in the last  summer.  If  such  a\r\n\r\ndrought could hit Europe, a place hitherto unknown for\r\n\r\nsevere  dry  spells, the chances of it affecting  this\r\n\r\npart  of  the world are even greater. We in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwith our limited water storage capacity, cannot afford\r\n\r\nto  wait  for a dry spell to threaten before  renewing\r\n\r\nour  water conservation habits. Moreover, it  is  good\r\n\r\nhousekeeping to economise in the use of water which is\r\n\r\nbecoming  more  expensive to treat and, therefore,  to\r\n\r\nconsume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, does the\r\n\r\nMinister agree that emphasis should always be  on  not\r\n\r\nto  waste  water?

It\r\n\r\nis  a  habit like brushing your teeth every day.  Once\r\n\r\nyou have acquired a good habit. I think you should not\r\n\r\ndrop  it.  To save water is also to save on your  F'UB\r\n\r\nbills and water is getting more expensive to treat.

Generating capacity of the system has grown\r\n\r\nfrom  464 MW (megawatts) in 1966 to 1.270 MW  now.  In\r\n\r\nthe  process  of expansion the system has become  more\r\n\r\nand   more  complex  and  sophisticated  and   certain\r\n\r\nautomatic   safety  devices  such  as   the   in-built\r\n\r\nmechanism   of   \"tripping\"  has  to  be   introduced.\r\n\r\n\"Tripping\" means an automatic disconnection  from  the\r\n\r\nsystem in the event of a fault.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day in question a new generator of 120 MW\r\n\r\ncapacity was commissioned at Senoko Power Station  and\r\n\r\nit was feeding 30 MW of electricity into a circuit for\r\n\r\ndistribution.  At  the  same time,  another  generator\r\n\r\ngenerating  90 MW was sending electricity through  the\r\n\r\nsame  circuit.  This circuit was carrying  120  MW  of\r\n\r\npower for distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before 4.00 p.m, the burner of the boiler of\r\n\r\nthe  new  generator failed and this generator tripped.\r\n\r\nThis    tripping   automatically   disconnected    the\r\n\r\ntransmission circuit and the other generator could not\r\n\r\ntransmit power\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  system.  The sudden loss  of  120  MW  caused\r\n\r\ninstability in the system which in turn triggered  the\r\n\r\ntripping  of the other generators at Jurong and  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang `B' Power Stations. This resulted in an island-wide blackout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a widespread blackout it takes time to\r\n\r\nrestore  the electricity to the system. But  this  can\r\n\r\nonly  be done progressively. Within half an hour after\r\n\r\nthe  blackout,  electricity had been restored  to  the\r\n\r\nfirst  areas and the situation had returned to  normal\r\n\r\nwithin  6\u00ab  hours.  The  blackout  was  so  widespread\r\n\r\nbecause,  for reasons of economy necessitated  by  the\r\n\r\nhigh  fuel  oil price, our spinning reserve  was  less\r\n\r\nthan  the capacity of the largest generating  unit  in\r\n\r\noperation.  However, having had this  experience  now.\r\n\r\nthe  PUB  will, in  spite of the increased  operating\r\n\r\ncost,  be  providing  spinning reserve  equal  to  the\r\n\r\ncapacity  of the largest generator in operation  until\r\n\r\nthe  Senoko  Stage I generators, i.e, the new  120  MW\r\n\r\ngenerators, are fully commissioned at the end of  this\r\n\r\nyear.  By  then, the teething problems encountered  in\r\n\r\ncommissioning  a  new  power station  will  have  been\r\n\r\nironed  out  and we may revert to the more  economical\r\n\r\nmode  of operation, that is, having a spinning reserve\r\n\r\nless  than  the capacity of the largest generators  in\r\n\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

That  is  what is meant by spinning  reserve.  To\r\n\r\nillustrate,  let me put it this way.  You  have  a  10\r\n\r\nhorse-power car and you are travelling in  it.  To  be\r\n\r\nsure  of  getting to the end of your journey you  have\r\n\r\nanother 10 horse-power car following you all the time.\r\n\r\nIn  case  the car you are travelling in should develop\r\n\r\nengine  trouble,  you  can then  switch  over  to  the\r\n\r\nreserve  car  and  continue to your  destination.  Our\r\n\r\nlargest generator at present has a capacity of 120 MW.\r\n\r\nTo enable the system to continue providing electricity\r\n\r\nshould our largest generator fail, there should be 120\r\n\r\nMW  generating capacity standing by. This  standby  is\r\n\r\nknown  as  spinning reserve. However, because  of  the\r\n\r\nhigh  cost of fuel we did not have that much  spinning\r\n\r\nreserve.  But now, having experienced it  and  knowing\r\n\r\nthat   there  will  be  teething  troubles  with   new\r\n\r\ngenerators and in spite of high costs, we are going to\r\n\r\nprovide   spinning  reserve  equal  to   the   largest\r\n\r\ngenerator we have in service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EAST COAST EXPRESSWAY TO ANSON ROAD</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Land reclamation and completion date)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and  Communications  (a)  when  the  land\r\n\r\nreclamation linking the East Coast to Anson Road  will\r\n\r\nbe  completed and, when completed, what uses the  land\r\n\r\nwill  be  put  to;  (b)  when the proposed  expressway\r\n\r\nitself will be completed and, when completed, how many\r\n\r\nlanes of traffic it will carry; and (c) whether, after\r\n\r\nreclamation  and completion of the expressway, floods\r\n\r\nwill occur during\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  periods  when  heavy rains coincide  with  high\r\n\r\ntides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Sir, the land reclamation linking the East Coast to\r\n\r\nAnson  Road is scheduled for completion by early 1978.\r\n\r\nPart  of  the  reclaimed land will `be  used  for  the\r\n\r\nexpressway linking the East Coast Parkway to the  City\r\n\r\nand  the  usage of the rest of the land is  now  under\r\n\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressway will be completed at the end of 1980.\r\n\r\nThere will be four lanes of traffic in each direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are pockets of low-lying areas between the\r\n\r\nEast  Coast  and Anson Road which may be flooded  when\r\n\r\nheavy rains coincide with high tides, irrespective  of\r\n\r\nwhether  there  was reclamation or not.

His\r\n\r\npassport  was issued on 4th March, 1969. Its  validity\r\n\r\nwas extended on 13th March, 1974 to 18th October, 1974\r\n\r\nwith  a  clearly impressed endorsement that no further\r\n\r\nextension could be made except by the office of  issue\r\n\r\nwhich  is the Immigration Department. This was because\r\n\r\nTan Wah Piow was in the call-up age and had to produce\r\n\r\nto  the Immigration Department an Exit Permit from the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence before any further extension could\r\n\r\nbe  considered.  No application was  received  by  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department for an extension  beyond  18th\r\n\r\nOctober. 1974.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21st October, 1976, the press reported Tan Wah\r\n\r\nPiow's  appearance in London. It stated that  Tan  Wah\r\n\r\nPiow  had  entered  the U.K, on a Singapore  passport.\r\n\r\nSince  Tan  Wah  Piow's passport had expired, it  was\r\n\r\nevident  that he must have tampered with  his  expired\r\n\r\npassport.  We requested and obtained from the  British\r\n\r\nauthorities  photostat  copies  of  Tan   Wah   Piow's\r\n\r\npassport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British authorities have now given us a\r\n\r\nphotostat copy showing an endorsement on the last page\r\n\r\nof  Tan Wah Piow's passport dated 24th October, 1974,\r\n\r\npurporting  to extend the validity of his passport  to\r\n\r\n4th March, 1979.

Photostat copies of Tan Wah Piow's passport\r\n\r\nshowed  that he did not go directly from Singapore  to\r\n\r\nthe  U.K.  He  could  not have got  through  Singapore\r\n\r\nairport  or any other checkpoint undetected  with  his\r\n\r\nexpired passport. According to the press. Tan Wah Piow\r\n\r\nclaimed  he slipped into Malaysia. We do not have  any\r\n\r\nother  evidence  of  this for  his  passport  was  not\r\n\r\nendorsed  either in Kuala Lumpur or Penang airport  or\r\n\r\nany other exit checkpoint in Malaysia. The endorsement\r\n\r\nof  the passport showed that he arrived in Thailand on\r\n\r\n12th June, 1976, and stayed there until  23rd  June.\r\n\r\n1976, when he flew off from Bangkok. He then proceeded\r\n\r\nto  Amsterdam before arriving at London on 30th  June.\r\n\r\n1976.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported that he entered U.K, and was given a\r\n\r\npermit  to stay for six months. It is well known  that\r\n\r\nthose  who wan~ to visit the U.K, for six months  have\r\n\r\nto  apply to a British embassy or high commission  for\r\n\r\nan   entry   certificate.  The  grant  of   an   entry\r\n\r\ncertificate is not automatic, and it is unlikely  that\r\n\r\na forged passport extension would go unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what action the Government intends to take.\r\n\r\nthe  question is whether we should have him extradited\r\n\r\nand  on  what grounds. Let me recount Tan  Wah  Piow's\r\n\r\nposition.  He was convicted for rioting and  sentenced\r\n\r\nto  12  months' imprisonment. He has served his  term.\r\n\r\nImmediately after his release, he was granted, at  his\r\n\r\nrequest,   three  days'  compassionate  leave   before\r\n\r\nreporting for National Service. He absconded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the law, absconding from National\r\n\r\nService is not an extraditable offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have now evidence from a photostat given by\r\n\r\nthe  British authorities that he has committed forgery\r\n\r\nwith   regard   to  his  passport.   Forgery   is   an\r\n\r\nextraditable offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we should await the decision of the British\r\n\r\nauthorities as to whether they will be prosecuting Tan\r\n\r\nWah Piow since he has used an expired passport with  a\r\n\r\nforged extension to enter the U.K. I am advised this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  a  criminal  offence under  British  law.

During  the\r\n\r\ninterim  period from 1980-82, Paya Lebar Airport  will\r\n\r\nbe  used to cater for the over-spill of civil aircraft\r\n\r\ntraffic  which could not be handled by Changi  Airport\r\n\r\nwith  only  one  runway.  A new  direct  express  road\r\n\r\nlinking Paya Lebar Airport to Changi Airport is  being\r\n\r\nbuilt. This will provide a fast and efficient flow  of\r\n\r\npassengers  and  vehicles between  the  two  Airports.\r\n\r\nAfter  the  second runway at Changi  is  completed  in\r\n\r\n1982,   Paya  Lebar  Airport  will  be   used   as   a\r\n\r\nsupplementary  airport  to  Changi.

Since implementation\r\n\r\nof  the  MRT  will  affect many other sectors  besides\r\n\r\ntransport,  careful consideration has to be  given  to\r\n\r\nnot  only'  its  costs  but its likely  influence  and\r\n\r\nimpact   on   development   planning,   locations   of\r\n\r\nemployment and residential centres, commuting  habits,\r\n\r\nand  the  economy in general.

Hills have been levelled and  swamps  and\r\n\r\nlow-lying  areas, which served as flood  basins, have\r\n\r\nbeen  filled  in.  As a result, rain water  no  longer\r\n\r\nseeps into the ground as much as before, but runs  off\r\n\r\nrapidly  and  sometimes causes floods.  When  a  heavy\r\n\r\nrainfall coincides with a high tide, especially a high\r\n\r\nspring  tide, floods occur in some areas and sometimes\r\n\r\neven in areas which were never flooded before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of the canal near the Turf Club to\r\n\r\ndivert flood waters from Bukit Timah to Ulu Pandan has\r\n\r\nalleviated  but  not  eradicated flooding  along  that\r\n\r\nmajor trunk road.

The Establishment  List,\r\n\r\nwhich  forms  part  of the Estimates  of  Expenditure,\r\n\r\nshows, in  respect of each Head of  Expenditure,  the\r\n\r\nauthorised number and grades of posts as well as their\r\n\r\nsalary  codes  and serves as the control document  for\r\n\r\nthe Government's establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The format of the Establishment List was designed\r\n\r\nfor  a  system  in  which  officers  filled  posts  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with their grades or were paid  allowances\r\n\r\nfor  the additional responsibility of acting in  posts\r\n\r\nhigher than their own grades. However, a decision  has\r\n\r\nbeen made recently to abolish acting allowances and to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  system of responsibility allowances  and\r\n\r\nmerit  promotions, whereby  promotions  will  now  be\r\n\r\ndecided  on  the  basis  of the  merit  of  individual\r\n\r\ncandidates and will no longer depend on the number  of\r\n\r\nvacancies  in  the various grades of appointment.  The\r\n\r\nEstablishment  List in future should  no  longer  show\r\n\r\ngrades of appointments under Heads of Expenditure.  It\r\n\r\nis intended instead that the authorised manpower under\r\n\r\neach  Head  of  Expenditure be arranged  according  to\r\n\r\nPersonnel Groups. Each Personnel Group will comprise a\r\n\r\nsingle  recruitment grade and a number of  promotional\r\n\r\ngrades.

The substantial\r\n\r\namendment is in respect of subsection (3) of section 1\r\n\r\n7  which stipulates that the Establishment List  shall\r\n\r\nshow   the   public  offices  under   each   Head   of\r\n\r\nExpenditure.  This  subsection  will  be  amended   to\r\n\r\nprovide that the Establishment List should show  under\r\n\r\neach  Head  of  Expenditure the political appointments\r\n\r\nand  the  number  and  categories of  personnel  whose\r\n\r\nsalaries  are  to be met from the allocations  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget.  The  existing  requirement  that  all  public\r\n\r\noffices  or  posts  be  identified  in  full  in   the\r\n\r\nEstablishment List will be deleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is being taken to amend also the\r\n\r\nother   subsections  of  section  1  7.

It  is\r\n\r\nproposed to delete this subsection to provide  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeciding upon the structure of individual subheads  in\r\n\r\nthe Main Estimates.

The  purpose  of  this Bill  is  to  bring  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the old Acts under one cover and at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time to provide more effective measures  against\r\n\r\nthe  spread of infectious diseases. The need for  this\r\n\r\nBill is substantiated by the outbreak of two epidemics\r\n\r\nin  1975  - a malaria epidemic and a typhoid epidemic.\r\n\r\nInvestigations showed that the outbreak of malaria  in\r\n\r\nthe  Whampoa area was due to a single patient who  had\r\n\r\nbeen  infected  by  the disease when  he  was  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As facilities for travel become easier and\r\n\r\nimmigration  controls  are more  relaxed,  it  becomes\r\n\r\nessential  for  Singapore to be vigilant  against  the\r\n\r\nimportation and spread of infectious diseases  in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic. At present, diseases which must be  notified\r\n\r\nby  medical practitioners include cholera and typhoid,\r\n\r\nplague,   smallpox, yellow   fever,   chicken   pox,\r\n\r\ndiphtheria,     leprosy, malaria, poliomyelitis,\r\n\r\ntuberculosis and typhus. Under the provisions of  this\r\n\r\nBill, the  schedule of notifiable diseases  has  been\r\n\r\nwidened  to include infectious hepatitis, encephalitis\r\n\r\nand  venereal diseases, Although private  doctors  are\r\n\r\nrequired to notify cases of venereal diseases, they do\r\n\r\nnot  have to reveal the names and particulars of their\r\n\r\npatients.  The reason for such a step is to  encourage\r\n\r\ninfected  persons  to  seek  treatment  by  their  own\r\n\r\ndoctors as early as possible. In this way, it is hoped\r\n\r\nthat  the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  can\r\n\r\nbe  voluntarily  kept under control  without  patients\r\n\r\nbeing fearful that they will be publicly embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control of infectious diseases within Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be  administered  by  the  Director  of  Medical\r\n\r\nServices, whilst the prevention and  introduction  of\r\n\r\nsuch diseases, in particular cholera, typhoid, malaria\r\n\r\nand dengue haemorrhagic fever, into Singapore will  be\r\n\r\nadministered by the Commissioner of Public  Health  in\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of the Environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 of the Bill empowers the Director of\r\n\r\nMedical  Services to prohibit any person from carrying\r\n\r\non any occupation, trade or business if in doing so he\r\n\r\nwill cause the spread of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House are aware of the \"Combat\r\n\r\nInfectious Diseases Campaign\" carried out in September\r\n\r\nthis  year, during  which the  public  attention  was\r\n\r\nfocussed   on   tuberculosis,   food-borne   diseases,\r\n\r\nmalaria,   dengue  haemorrhagic  fever, leprosy   and\r\n\r\nvenereal diseases. The campaign has been successful in\r\n\r\neducating the public into the causes and effects posed\r\n\r\nby these diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from legislative measures, I believe that an\r\n\r\neducated  and well-informed public is a more important\r\n\r\nfactor in controlling the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutbreak  of  epidemics and assure a high standard  of\r\n\r\nhealth in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in\r\n\r\nsupport  of the Bill. To describe the introduction  of\r\n\r\nthis Infectious Diseases Bill as timely might well  be\r\n\r\nthe   understatement  of  the  year.  This  piece   of\r\n\r\nlegislation  is  really long overdue as  the  existing\r\n\r\nQuarantine  and Prevention of Diseases Act which  this\r\n\r\nBill seeks largely to replace was first introduced  in\r\n\r\n1915. Many of the references in the original Act  are\r\n\r\ntherefore  completely out of date, even to the  extent\r\n\r\nof retaining quaint colonial overtones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the section in the old Act devoted\r\n\r\nto the interpretation of terms, much space is taken by\r\n\r\nreference to animals, carcass, cattle, dairy,  fodder,\r\n\r\nlitter, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Corpse!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Yes.

For the benefit of the younger members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  whose  experience may not  have  included\r\n\r\nacquaintance  with the term \"gharri\", it  means  horse\r\n\r\ncart.  This Bill, therefore, seeks to replace  an  old\r\n\r\noutmoded  colonial piece of legislation with something\r\n\r\nmore related to our present circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some of the classic diseases which the old\r\n\r\npiece  of legislation was particularly exercised over.\r\n\r\nsuch  as  small-pox  and plague, have  been  virtually\r\n\r\neliminated we must always keep our defences up against\r\n\r\nthe  risk of introduction of infectious diseases  from\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore. Though we do not  have  immigrants\r\n\r\narriving on foot, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbullock-carts or in gharries (we have emigrants  going\r\n\r\nout with forged passports!), modern modes of transport\r\n\r\nand  the  large  influx and movement of  tourists  and\r\n\r\nthose  on  business  have made Singapore  one  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiest  crossroads  of international  travel  in  the\r\n\r\nworld. There always remains the risk of diseases being\r\n\r\nintroduced without prior warning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern international traffic is so intensive that it\r\n\r\nis not possible to set up any kind of cordon sanitaire\r\n\r\nof  the  good old days. Quarantine laws have therefore\r\n\r\nto be updated in keeping with contemporary conditions.\r\n\r\nFor,  not  only do we have the better known infectious\r\n\r\ndiseases  to  guard against, but there  are  also  new\r\n\r\nexotic   but   nonetheless   very   dangerous    viral\r\n\r\nafflictions, outbreaks of which have been noted in one\r\n\r\nor  two countries, both developed and under developed.\r\n\r\nPowers to tackle such diseases, even if these ailments\r\n\r\nare  not  presently  subject to  international  health\r\n\r\nregulations, have been incorporated in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should remember. Mr Speaker, Sir, that Singapore\r\n\r\nis  one of the healthiest countries in the world where\r\n\r\nenvironmental conditions are concerned and  we  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to keep it that way. Our people are provided\r\n\r\nwith  safe  drinking water, modern  sanitation  and  a\r\n\r\nclean environment. The inculcation of better standards\r\n\r\nof personal hygiene and public health has been part of\r\n\r\nthe  continuing  public education  programmes  of  the\r\n\r\nrelevant Government departments, programmes that  have\r\n\r\nbeen carried out at community centres and through mass\r\n\r\ncampaigns and in other ways. Where infectious diseases\r\n\r\nhave occurred sporadically, our constant vigilance and\r\n\r\neffective  surveillance have paid dividends  in  early\r\n\r\ndetection and immediate action and treatment to ensure\r\n\r\nthat the diseases are brought under control quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has often enough been stated that our best assets\r\n\r\nand  prime resources are people. It is important  that\r\n\r\nevery  effort  be made to safeguard their  health  and\r\n\r\nprotect them from avoidable infection: this especially\r\n\r\nso  in  view  of  the  fact of the close  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour   relatively  high  standard  of  living  and  our\r\n\r\nachievement in the field of public health.

Members  who  have recently so  enthusiastically\r\n\r\nplayed  their part in the \"Combat Infectious  Diseases\r\n\r\nCampaign\"  will support fully this move to update  the\r\n\r\nlaws relating to the control of infectious diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the Minister has pointed out, it is not\r\n\r\nenough  merely to pass laws and implement them at  the\r\n\r\nofficial  level.  For  the  effect  of  laws   to   be\r\n\r\nsuccessful,   it  is  necessary  to  have   the   full\r\n\r\ncooperation of the population. Although the  ensurance\r\n\r\nof   clean  water  supply  and  modern  sanitation  to\r\n\r\nhouseholds   have  eliminated  many  of   the   common\r\n\r\ninfectious  diseases  such as  cholera, some  enteric\r\n\r\ndiseases are still prevalent.
