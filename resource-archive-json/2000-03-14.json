This\r\n\r\nsituation arises because patients, by and large, prefer to be\r\n\r\nseen  by the specialists and the charges at the SOCs are  not\r\n\r\nsignificantly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhigher than those charged by the family physicians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients therefore may experience long queues and\r\n\r\nwaiting times at the SOCs from time to time for the following\r\n\r\nreasons:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Patients' preference to be seen by certain\r\n\r\nspecialists  who have a long waiting list.   To  shorten  the\r\n\r\nappointment  waiting time for patients, the  clinic  sessions\r\n\r\nfor  these specialists are therefore overbooked, which  would\r\n\r\ninvariably contribute to a longer queue and waiting time;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Appointments made at the SOCs are scheduled\r\n\r\nassuming that they are \"normal\" cases with average length  of\r\n\r\nconsultation  time.  However, in the clinic  situation,  some\r\n\r\nconsultations  turn out to be more complex and  require  more\r\n\r\ntime.   This leads to a cascading effect whereby the  waiting\r\n\r\ntime  for  consultation  for  subsequent  patients  would  be\r\n\r\naffected;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) From time to time, a patient's medical condition\r\n\r\nchanges  or  deteriorates such that he requires  to  see  the\r\n\r\nspecialist earlier than the given appointment date.  In  such\r\n\r\ninstances, based on medical need, the SOC may have to arrange\r\n\r\nan  urgent  appointment  for  the  patient  even  though  the\r\n\r\nspecialist is already fully booked for the day; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Occasionally, the specialists are called away to\r\n\r\nattend to emergencies in the ward or operating theatres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry and the public hospitals have instituted\r\n\r\nthe  following specific measures to improve the waiting times\r\n\r\nat the SOCs:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To increase the number of clinic sessions for\r\n\r\nspecialists with long waiting lists;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To extend clinic operating hours for specialists\r\n\r\nwith very high patient-load; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To initiate an active discharge plan for patients\r\n\r\nno  longer requiring specialist care for follow up  by  their\r\n\r\nfamily physicians.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are, however, short-term palliative measures to\r\n\r\ndeal with the high patient load at our SOCs.  We need to do a\r\n\r\nmore fundamental review of outpatient care by specialists and\r\n\r\nfamily  physicians to achieve our objective of ensuring  that\r\n\r\npatients  receive care appropriate to their needs.   Ideally,\r\n\r\npatients  should turn to their family physicians  first  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  ill.   The  family physicians  will  manage  their\r\n\r\nmedical    condition   with   appropriate    referrals    and\r\n\r\ncollaboration  with  the specialists.   However,  this  is  a\r\n\r\ncomplex issue which would involve patient education, ensuring\r\n\r\nhigh  quality  of  family  physicians,  and  review  of   the\r\n\r\nspecialist  referral  system  and  fees  charged.   With  the\r\n\r\nformation  of  the  two networks, we will  make  a  start  by\r\n\r\ninterfacing the polyclinics with the SOCs.  Where the patient\r\n\r\nis  adequately looked after by the polyclinics,  it  will  be\r\n\r\ndone  there,  and not at the SOCs.  The networks will  extend\r\n\r\nthis   collaboration   to  the  private   family   physicians\r\n\r\nsubsequently.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to declare that I am a doctor in private practice.\r\n\r\nMay I ask the Minister why specialist outpatient clinics take\r\n\r\nappointments from any patient who so wishes through the phone\r\n\r\nand  without  any  referral?  Would  not  such  practice  run\r\n\r\ncounter  to  the basic tenet of cost efficient and  effective\r\n\r\nmedicine?   Surely  not  every sickness  needs  the  care  of\r\n\r\nspecialists?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree entirely with\r\n\r\nthe  Member.  Ideally, every patient should be managed by his\r\n\r\nfamily  physician, and see the family physician first and  if\r\n\r\nthe  condition  requires the care of a  specialist,  then  he\r\n\r\nshould be referred to the specialist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we do not enforce a compulsory referral\r\n\r\nsystem.  We encourage referrals by the polyclinics and family\r\n\r\nGPs.   We do not make it compulsory that if a patient is  not\r\n\r\nreferred by a private sector GP, he is not allowed to see the\r\n\r\nspecialist.  This is the situation today.  I think we have to\r\n\r\nwork on the education\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the  general  public that they should  see  their  family\r\n\r\nphysicians first.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Would the Minister condone such referrals?\r\n\r\nWould  not  such  referrals to specialist outpatient  clinics\r\n\r\ncause an inappropriate use of medical facilities, and tax our\r\n\r\npublic hospitals unnecessarily and frivolously?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, compulsory referral is the ideal\r\n\r\nsituation, but I think we want to be more flexible.  In  some\r\n\r\ncases,  patients  make appointment with the  SOCs.   In  some\r\n\r\ncases,  they are discharged from the hospitals and they  have\r\n\r\nrecovered.   But if they think that something  has  recurred,\r\n\r\nthey may want to make an appointment with the SOCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have adopted a more flexible approach. Unlike\r\n\r\nsome  countries, for example, they may insist on a compulsory\r\n\r\nreferral.   We have not reached the stage where  we  feel  we\r\n\r\nneed to insist on a compulsory referral situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister did\r\n\r\nnot  get  me correctly.  I did not mean subsequent  check-ups\r\n\r\nwith  the specialist where they can go back any time.   I  am\r\n\r\ntalking  about  first-timers who just call up the  outpatient\r\n\r\nclinics  for an appointment and they just walk in to see  the\r\n\r\nspecialist.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I think the Member also did not get my\r\n\r\nanswer.   We  do  not enforce a compulsory  referral  system.\r\n\r\nToday,  we  are a bit more relaxed and we allow  patients  to\r\n\r\nrefer  themselves to the SOCs.  Of course,  we  can  adopt  a\r\n\r\ncompulsory referral system, meaning that if a patient is  not\r\n\r\nreferred by a private sector or a polyclinic GP, then  he  is\r\n\r\nnot  allowed to see the specialist.  We can discuss  and  see\r\n\r\nwhether  that  is  indeed a better system.   But  today,  the\r\n\r\npractice is that we allow Singaporeans the flexibility to  go\r\n\r\nto  the  SOCs.   In  a way, I think it serves  us  well.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it leads to a longer queue in the SOCs, but this  is\r\n\r\nthe trade-off.  And Singaporeans seem prepared to accept this\r\n\r\ntrade-off.   If  the feedback from all the  Members  is  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  want  to have a compulsory referral  system  so\r\n\r\nthat the queues in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSOCs will be shortened, I am prepared to consider that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Can the Minister be more explicit in his\r\n\r\nreply,  Sir?  How do we expect patients to know the  severity\r\n\r\nof their illnesses to warrant specialist care all the time if\r\n\r\nwe just allow them self-referrals?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I think we have to be quite\r\n\r\npragmatic  about the situation.  Singaporeans now  serve  the\r\n\r\nNet.   They  read all kinds of things on the  Net.   They  do\r\n\r\nquite a bit of self-diagnosis.  It is not the ideal thing  to\r\n\r\ndo.   But  when Singaporeans think that they have  a  problem\r\n\r\nwith,  say, incontinence, they would want to see a specialist\r\n\r\nfirst.  They do not want to see their GP.  Unless we say  no,\r\n\r\nthat  is not allowed, and we change to a completely different\r\n\r\nregime,  but  today  the  rules  allow  them  to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nspecialist and we accept that practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  as  I understand the Minister,  he  seems  to\r\n\r\nattribute  the long queues partly and for a greater  part  to\r\n\r\nthe  reluctance  of  people to go and see  their  own  family\r\n\r\nphysicians.  Does he think that perhaps cost may be a  factor\r\n\r\nin  this?   Has his Ministry ever considered getting  private\r\n\r\ndoctors  into a scheme of voluntary service?  The specialists\r\n\r\noutside  could help and the Government could subsidise  their\r\n\r\nfees,  if  they would only collect a certain amount from  the\r\n\r\npatients.  Has the Minister thought about this at all?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my answer, I\r\n\r\nattributed  to  two main reasons for the long queues  in  the\r\n\r\nSOCs.   One,  is the tendency for people to want to  see  the\r\n\r\nspecialists rather than their family physicians.  And I agree\r\n\r\nwith Dr Lily Neo that it is not the ideal practice.  In fact,\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  encourages and is putting in place measures  to\r\n\r\nencourage  Singaporeans to see their family physicians  first\r\n\r\nbefore  seeing  the specialist.  The share  of  the  workload\r\n\r\nbetween  the family physicians and the specialists  today  is\r\n\r\nweighted  to the specialist, because Singaporeans operate  on\r\n\r\nthe  understanding that if they have a specific problem, they\r\n\r\nwant to see a specialist before seeing the family physician.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which I put in my answer is cost. Not\r\n\r\nthat  it is more expensive to see a specialist, but that  the\r\n\r\ncost  of seeing a specialist in our SOCs is not significantly\r\n\r\nhigher  than  seeing  a  private sector  GP.   So  the  price\r\n\r\ndifferential between a private sector GP and SOC  is  not  so\r\n\r\nbig  that  Singaporeans will be encouraged to  see  a  family\r\n\r\nphysician first before seeing SOCs.  Singaporeans can  afford\r\n\r\nto  see  a specialist.  The differential is not so high.   So\r\n\r\nthey go straight to the specialist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member suggested getting doctors to provide\r\n\r\nvoluntary services.  I am sure if doctors are prepared to  do\r\n\r\nso, we will work with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Have you suggested a plan?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We have to be quite realistic. The\r\n\r\nspecialists  in the private sector run their  clinics.   They\r\n\r\ncharge  private  sector fees.  Many of these specialists  are\r\n\r\ninvolved  in community work and we encourage them to  do  so.\r\n\r\nBut  to  expect  private sector specialists to run  voluntary\r\n\r\nclinics on a fee or subsidised basis is something that is not\r\n\r\nso pragmatic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  may not be aware that the practice of  referral  to\r\n\r\nsee  a  specialist  in  the past was actually  by  way  of  a\r\n\r\nreferral   system  through  the  general  practitioner.    My\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  is  this  change from  the  previous  type  of\r\n\r\npractice, where referral is through a general practitioner, a\r\n\r\nway for the restructured hospital doctors to get more income?\r\n\r\nThat is one thing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is this. Is the Minister aware that it\r\n\r\nis not affordability that should allow people to go and see a\r\n\r\nspecialist  on their own?  I think it is the proper  approach\r\n\r\nto  the whole healthcare delivery system that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth is trying to put out.  This means that patients should\r\n\r\nactually  get the correct information, the correct  direction\r\n\r\nfrom  his  general practitioner before seeing the appropriate\r\n\r\nspecialist.  They might see the wrong specialist.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I agree entirely with Dr Tan Cheng\r\n\r\nBock.    That  is  the  ideal  practice.   We  are   actively\r\n\r\nencouraging it.  But we have not made it compulsory that if a\r\n\r\npatient   does  not come with a referral, we  will  turn  him\r\n\r\naway.  So we are still flexible.  If people do not come  with\r\n\r\na  referral, we will, of course, counsel them and say,  \"Next\r\n\r\ntime, please see your family physician.\"  But we do not  turn\r\n\r\nthem away if they do not come with a referral.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is a multi-faceted problem. At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  we  must  get  our GPs and our  family  physicians  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  themselves, so that they offer such a good level  of\r\n\r\nservice   that  Singaporeans  have  a  very  high  level   of\r\n\r\nconfidence  that their overall medical needs  can  be  looked\r\n\r\nafter  effectively by their family physicians.  So it is  not\r\n\r\njust  making it compulsory for the patient to see the  family\r\n\r\nphysician.   I  think the family physicians  themselves  must\r\n\r\nalso  upgrade and do continuing medicare education,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe   level  of  expertise,  the  level  of  skills  and  the\r\n\r\nconfidence can also be raised.  Then I think we will reach  a\r\n\r\nsituation  where  people want to see their family  physicians\r\n\r\nand not be forced to see their family physicians.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the Minister said earlier that he\r\n\r\nagreed  with me.

But as  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  the  fee  structure  of  our  SOCs  today  is  not  so\r\n\r\nsignificantly   higher   than  the  private   sector   family\r\n\r\nphysician. Singaporeans now are better educated.   They  want\r\n\r\nchoice  and,  therefore, we have not moved  to  a  compulsory\r\n\r\nsystem.  Today, they have a choice.  We discourage them.   We\r\n\r\ntry  to  educate  them.  We try to work with the  College  of\r\n\r\nFamily  Physicians to upgrade themselves so that  the  public\r\n\r\ncan  have  more  confidence in the ability  of  their  family\r\n\r\nphysicians.   It is not just one side of the coin.   I  think\r\n\r\nthe  family physicians must also show to the public that they\r\n\r\ncan handle a wide range of problems when a patient sees them,\r\n\r\nif   not,   the  patient  would  want  to  see  a  specialist\r\n\r\nstraightaway.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that\r\n\r\nreferral to a specialist is different from what he is  trying\r\n\r\nto  tell  us  that  if a general practitioner  is  very  well\r\n\r\nequipped, then there is less chance of him referring patients\r\n\r\nto  the  specialist?  Yes, I agree with that.  But there  are\r\n\r\ncertain situations ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

That  is  the\r\n\r\nimpression I get.  Is that correct?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not say that.\r\n\r\nI  said  that the family physician should upgrade himself  so\r\n\r\nthat  he  understands  the full range of  problems  that  the\r\n\r\npatient  is likely to raise with him and be in a position  to\r\n\r\nprovide the confidence to the patient that he will refer  him\r\n\r\nto the correct specialist.  It must be cost effective for the\r\n\r\npatient to do so.  If the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npatient thinks he has got a specific problem and the cost  is\r\n\r\nnot so significant in going straight to see a specialist,  he\r\n\r\nwill want to do so.  We could make it a compulsory system  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  you  are  not allowed to see  a  specialist  until\r\n\r\nreferred  to by a GP. We can do that.  But today we  are  not\r\n\r\ndoing  that.  We encourage everybody to do that, but  we  are\r\n\r\nnot  making  it  a compulsory system.  So I  am  keeping  the\r\n\r\nsystem as it is without making it compulsory.  If all the MPs\r\n\r\nfeel that this is crucial and that it will reduce health care\r\n\r\ncost  by  forcing  everybody to the  GPs  first,  I  must  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied that the GPs can undertake their role.

I think we should  leave\r\n\r\nit  to  the patient.  But can the Minister confirm  that  the\r\n\r\nrates that the patients are paying to the specialists are, in\r\n\r\nfact,  market  rates  so that there  is  no  subsidy  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment on all these consultations and there is no  impact\r\n\r\non the cost efficiency?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I thank the Member for trying to\r\n\r\nhelp  me  out.   There is a tremendous subsidy in  our  SOCs.\r\n\r\nMore  than  half of the patients going to our  SOCs  enjoy  a\r\n\r\nsubsidy  of  65% and all the rents and GST of  our  SOCs  are\r\n\r\nfully subvented by the Government.  Even for those who do not\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  subsidy, the so-called private  patients  in  our\r\n\r\nSOCs,  the fees which they are charged in the SOCs  are  much\r\n\r\nlower  than  the  private  sector.   Therefore,  as  I   have\r\n\r\nexplained  in  my  answer,  one  can  understand   why   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  troop to the SOCs straightaway  without  seeing\r\n\r\nthe  family  physician.   I am not  saying  this  is  a  good\r\n\r\npractice.   I  am saying we are trying to change  it  through\r\n\r\nbetter   patient   education,  through   upgrading   of   the\r\n\r\nphysicians.   But  to  have an edict to say  that,  tomorrow,\r\n\r\nnobody  is  allowed to go and see the SOCs  unless  they  are\r\n\r\nreferred  to by a family physician is a step which I  am  not\r\n\r\nprepared to take for the time being.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will allow one last question.

Basically,  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints could be in two categories.  The waiting  time  is\r\n\r\ntoo  long and services rendered by the medical staff are  not\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.   Patients have to wait too  long  to  see  the\r\n\r\ndoctors at the Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs),  and  at\r\n\r\nthe  A&E unit, patients inadvertently have to wait for a long\r\n\r\ntime before being admitted to the wards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey published recently in the Straits Times\r\n\r\nconfirmed that the waiting time at the 18 specialist  clinics\r\n\r\nat the Singapore General Hospital and at the NUH is about two\r\n\r\nhours.  With regard to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe service level, the people are not happy with the services\r\n\r\nof  the medical staff.  Secondly, they are worried about  the\r\n\r\nnurse-to-patient ratio.  For instance, patients complain that\r\n\r\nthe hospital staff lack the necessary skills in administering\r\n\r\nintravenous  drips  or inserting gastric tubes  to  suck  out\r\n\r\nfluids  from  the patient's stomach.  When they  ring  for  a\r\n\r\nnurse to come and assist them to go to the toilets, the nurse\r\n\r\ndoes  not  turn up even after a long wait.  Some cannot  help\r\n\r\nbut urinate on the bed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients who went back to the specialist clinics at the\r\n\r\nhospital told me that after waiting for 1 1/2 hours they were\r\n\r\nmerely  given a five-minute examination.  They wonder if  the\r\n\r\ndoctors  really understood their problems. Some patients  who\r\n\r\ncomplained  about their pains were told that there  were  too\r\n\r\nmany  problems and that these could not be diagnosed  at  one\r\n\r\nexamination and were told to come again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of course these were isolated cases. I could not\r\n\r\nsay  for  sure  what the overall service performance  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole  staff was.  I was worried after reading the  newspaper\r\n\r\nreport  of 7th February in the Straits Times that the  number\r\n\r\nof  patients had increased by 20% whereas the number of staff\r\n\r\nhad  increased by only 11%.  Some doctors said that they were\r\n\r\ntoo tired to maintain the requisite level of service. I quote\r\n\r\nfrom  the Straits Times: A cardiologist said, \"I spend  about\r\n\r\nfive minutes or less on a patient.  It is not enough.  I want\r\n\r\nto spend more time, but there are so many patients to see and\r\n\r\nso  much  to  do.\"    Is  it true that as  a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's plan to restructure, the hospitals have to  look\r\n\r\nat  the  bottom line and thus have to cut cost, resulting  in\r\n\r\nnot  enough  doctors and nurses being recruited?  Hence,  the\r\n\r\nquality of service is affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister for Health to give us an audit\r\n\r\non  the quality of service in the hospitals.  How frequent is\r\n\r\nthe  audit conducted?   Could the Minister tell us what  kind\r\n\r\nof  benchmark the Ministry of Health has with regard  to  the\r\n\r\nvarious  types of services in the hospitals and the level  of\r\n\r\nservice Singaporeans can expect in the healthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerald Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerald Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  consider setting up a hospital to  specifically\r\n\r\ntreat   patients  who  are  not  responding  to   established\r\n\r\ntreatments and medicines.  Such a hospital will be a place of\r\n\r\nlast resort and could be known as the Hospital of Hope.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be stringent entry requirements. A person\r\n\r\nwishing  to  be admitted to the Hospital of Hope must  obtain\r\n\r\nthe certification of at least two specialists to confirm that\r\n\r\nhe is not responding to established treatments and medicines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital will be a place where new but untried, and\r\n\r\nexperimental  treatments and medicines are applied  with  the\r\n\r\npatient's consent.

One good example that has been  neglected  in\r\n\r\nthis respect is the very common condition of asthma.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, asthma is a highly prevalent problem, seen\r\n\r\nin 5% of the adult population.   In a study that examined the\r\n\r\nhealthcare,  utilisation  patterns for  asthma  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nbetween 1986 and 1993, asthma was ranked 5th among principal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconditions with the highest number of discharges.  Among 0-14\r\n\r\nyear olds, asthma was ranked second, only after accidents and\r\n\r\ninjuries,  as  the  condition  with  the  highest  number  of\r\n\r\ndischarges.   It was estimated that there were  approximately\r\n\r\n20,000  accident and emergency (A&E) room visits  for  asthma\r\n\r\nper  annum.  In the primary healthcare setting, asthma ranked\r\n\r\n6th   among   leading   conditions  seen   by   the   general\r\n\r\npractitioners  and  Government polyclinics.   Among  under-15\r\n\r\nyear  olds,  asthma  ranked as the second leading  condition,\r\n\r\nbehind  upper respiratory tract infections.  Sir, this  study\r\n\r\nshowed  that  asthma is a significant cause of  morbidity  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in many countries, there has been a marked increase\r\n\r\nin the prevalence of childhood asthma over the past 20 years.\r\n\r\nIt  is estimated that 140,000 individuals have current asthma\r\n\r\nand more than 100 individuals die of this disease annually in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   There  is also a substantial  degree  of  under-recognition of asthma among school children in Singapore.   A\r\n\r\nrecent  local  study estimated the economic cost  of  asthma,\r\n\r\nboth direct and indirect, to the patient and community.   The\r\n\r\ntotal  cost of asthma in Singapore was estimated to  be  more\r\n\r\nthan  US$30 million per annum.  Sir, the study concluded that\r\n\r\nthe economic cost of asthma is considerable and justifies the\r\n\r\nneed for a concerted effort to reduce asthma morbidity.  This\r\n\r\nis especially so with such prevalence in children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asthma is an eminently treatable condition with good\r\n\r\nevidence  that newer interventions and adherence to treatment\r\n\r\ncan  be cost-effective in the long run.  Studies in Singapore\r\n\r\nhave  reflected  sub-optimal  management  of  asthma  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity;  this  area will benefit from  a  national  health\r\n\r\nprogramme.   What  is  required  is  a  Comprehensive  Asthma\r\n\r\nProgramme,  aimed at reducing asthma mortality and  morbidity\r\n\r\nat  all  levels of the healthcare system, with the  long-term\r\n\r\ngoal  of improving the care of asthma cost-effectively.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere is a need to make asthma a healthcare priority, in  the\r\n\r\nsame  league  as other common diseases such as cardiovascular\r\n\r\ndisease, cancer, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school environment is particularly important to\r\n\r\nchildren with asthma because acute exacerbations can lead  to\r\n\r\ndecreased ability to concentrate, decreased participation  in\r\n\r\nactivities,   and   high   rates   of   absenteeism.     Sir,\r\n\r\nidentification  of  children with the disease,  communication\r\n\r\nwith  parents and health-care providers, removal of  triggers\r\n\r\nin  the  immediate  school environment, and  maximisation  of\r\n\r\naccess  to  medication when needed are  all  key  factors  in\r\n\r\nmanaging  the  disease.   We can tap  the  expertise  of  the\r\n\r\ndoctors  from  the  Singapore  Asthma  Association  to  train\r\n\r\nteachers to handle asthma in schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to significantly reduce asthma morbidity, an\r\n\r\nintegrated approach is required, involving individuals from a\r\n\r\nbroad  range of backgrounds and interests.  There is  also  a\r\n\r\nneed  to  coordinate  the  efforts of  such  individuals  and\r\n\r\ninstitutions involved in asthma care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Health could consider my\r\n\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now go on to my next amendment on medical\r\n\r\nestablishments?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Thank you. Sir, I would like to urge the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health to look into greater integration  of  the\r\n\r\npublic   and  private  medical  sectors  concerning   medical\r\n\r\nestablishments.  I would like to declare that I am a  general\r\n\r\npractitioner in private practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Ministry of Health is able and willing to treat\r\n\r\nthe  private  hospitals like \"private wings\" of  restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals, and use the multitude of general practice  clinics\r\n\r\nas extensions of polyclinics, integration in a lateral manner\r\n\r\ncan  become  a  reality.  This would involve a  fairly  major\r\n\r\nmindset  change by all the relevant people in our  healthcare\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   Sir, lateral integration of all  the  medical\r\n\r\nestablishments in Singapore will be a good thing and I  would\r\n\r\nlike to point out some of the advantages that we may reap.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An area of benefit from integration between public and\r\n\r\nprivate  hospitals  and clinics is in the  \"shared  use\"  and\r\n\r\n\"free flow\" of available personnel, especially in those areas\r\n\r\nwhere  there  is  a  shortage.  This will save  cost  as  the\r\n\r\nintegration  and cooperation minimises expensive training  of\r\n\r\nmore and more people.  This will maximise our efficiency  and\r\n\r\nenable optimum use of our resources.  The savings can then be\r\n\r\npassed on to the patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another advantage of integration is in the shared\r\n\r\nuse  of  expensive equipment in both the private  and  public\r\n\r\nsectors.    There   is  a  need  for  better   planning   and\r\n\r\ncollaboration in this area between these two sectors.   There\r\n\r\nare  many  instances  where it makes  no  economic  sense  to\r\n\r\nsupport  two  expensive machines, such as 4 million-dollar  a\r\n\r\npiece  PAT-Scan or Positron Axial Tomogram Scan in  both  the\r\n\r\nprivate  and public sectors.  We do not have enough users  to\r\n\r\njustify the availability of more than one scanner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalising on existing equipment that is available and\r\n\r\nmuch  too under-utilised in the private sector should be made\r\n\r\navailable to the public sector and vice-versa.  Patients from\r\n\r\nthe  public hospitals may not be able to afford the cost  for\r\n\r\nusing  such equipment in a private set-up.  Sir, this can  be\r\n\r\novercome if the private set-up weighs its options of  leaving\r\n\r\nthe  equipment to stand idle or of letting the  equipment  be\r\n\r\nused by the public hospitals at special (out-sourced) rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bulk order of standard requirements of hospitals and\r\n\r\nclinics, like catheters, needles, sutures, medicines, and  so\r\n\r\non, jointly by all medical estalishments, makes good economic\r\n\r\nsense.   When  the  lowered costs are made available  to  all\r\n\r\nmedical   establishments,  including  private  clinics,   all\r\n\r\npatients  will  benefit.  They get  to  pay  less  for  their\r\n\r\ntreatment  and  general expenses.  The savings  in  cost  can\r\n\r\namount  to  a few hundred dollars, a 50% reduction at  times,\r\n\r\nfor some patients each month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of useful area of cooperation through\r\n\r\nintegration is a centralised sterilisation for all medical\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nestablishments.  This is one area worth considering.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Health would consider my\r\n\r\naforesaid suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Sir, the White Paper on\r\n\r\nhealthcare  has  spelt out the requirements for  doctors  and\r\n\r\nnurses  for  both the public and private sectors.   Over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  there have been so many changes in Singapore  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  region  which  have  also impacted  on  projections  for\r\n\r\nmedical personnel required to sustain and improve the quality\r\n\r\nof  medical care.  For example, we thought that the  regional\r\n\r\ncrisis  will  lead to a decline of patients from  the  region\r\n\r\nwhich, in fact, it did for a while.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid recovery of Singapore's economy and to a\r\n\r\ncertain  extent, those in the region, has renewed the  demand\r\n\r\nfor more medical services, leading to more doctors and nurses\r\n\r\nneeded  to service them.  The problem, of course, is that  we\r\n\r\ncannot  simply  turn the tap on and expect more  doctors  and\r\n\r\nnurses  to  come  out.  Training of doctors and  nurses  take\r\n\r\ntime,  in particular when it comes to specialists.  There  is\r\n\r\nalso a close nexus between the public and private sectors  in\r\n\r\nboth  good  and  bad times.  The national centres  that  were\r\n\r\nestablished  would  also  tend  to  take  the  bulk  of   the\r\n\r\nspecialists, leaving the private sector with less.  How do we\r\n\r\nstrike  a  proper  balance  between  the  two,  as  each  can\r\n\r\ncontribute its part to make Singapore an eminent medical hub?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister elaborate on what are the steps being\r\n\r\ntaken to adapt to these changes?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nshare  the  views  of  my  GPC  Chairman,  Mr  Bernard  Chen.\r\n\r\nHowever, I wish to focus on our nurses in the health service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses play a very important role in the care of\r\n\r\npatients  in  our hospitals.  They are constantly  in  direct\r\n\r\ncontact  with patients.  If we visit our hospitals  nowadays,\r\n\r\nwe  find  that  there is a big percentage of nurses  who  are\r\n\r\nforeigners, especially from the Philippines, China  and  even\r\n\r\nsome from the advanced countries.  I believe these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nforeign nurses are taken into our service due to the shortage\r\n\r\nof our locals wanting to become nurses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can enlighten us on the reasons for\r\n\r\nthe  lack  of  Singaporeans who are keen to be nurses.   What\r\n\r\nsteps   is   the  Ministry  taking  to  attract  more   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to take up nursing as a career?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1998, there were a total of 15,568 nurses and\r\n\r\nmidwives   registered  with  the  Singapore  Nursing   Board.\r\n\r\nHowever,  almost  20%  or 3,060 of them  are  not  in  active\r\n\r\npractice.   I  think it is such a waste because  almost  one-fifth of them are not practising their skills that they  have\r\n\r\nlearned  during their training to be nurses and midwives.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Ministry can do something to attract these  nurses\r\n\r\nnot  in  active  practice to come back and serve  our  health\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, according to the national health manpower\r\n\r\nto  population, the ratio for nurses is about one to 250.   I\r\n\r\nwish  to  ask the Minister whether there are plans to improve\r\n\r\nthis ratio, bearing in the mind the higher standard of living\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I would like to urge the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  to look towards the greater integration of our public\r\n\r\nand private medical sectors concerning doctors.  I would like\r\n\r\nto  declare  that  I  am a doctor in private  practice.   The\r\n\r\ndoctors  in the private sector are not tapped to the  fullest\r\n\r\npotential.  The doctors in the public sector are not  exactly\r\n\r\ncontent  with their lot.  Sir, we need to soften  the  divide\r\n\r\nbetween the two sectors for the better of all concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first consider the case for doctors in private\r\n\r\npractice.   It  will  be advantageous if  we  can  have  them\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the public sector.  The most overt effects  of\r\n\r\nsuch a situation would be:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The reduction of the very heavy workload of doctors\r\n\r\nin  the  public sector.  We can revamp the present  \"visiting\r\n\r\nconsultants\"  scheme  and implement  a  structured  permanent\r\n\r\nscheme  for  private  doctors to contribute  to  patients  in\r\n\r\npublic sector positively.  At the moment, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexisting  consultant scheme is only a token.  A comprehensive\r\n\r\ntype  of  contribution is not possible  perhaps  because  the\r\n\r\nagenda   does  not  call  for  it.   It  is  not  implemented\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly and this scheme is not very successful because\r\n\r\nthere  may  be  distrust and fear amongst  doctors  regarding\r\n\r\nmotives and vested interests.  Private doctors have to depend\r\n\r\non  the friendship and courtesy of their colleagues in public\r\n\r\nhospitals to be offered \"visiting consultant\" posts and, even\r\n\r\nthen,  some may still feel redundant and unwelcome.   Sir,  a\r\n\r\nnew scheme should be in place to allow private clinicians  to\r\n\r\ncome  back  either  part-time  or  full-time  in  the  public\r\n\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Many private doctors are more than willing to serve\r\n\r\nsubsidised  patients  and to teach in  the  public  hospitals\r\n\r\ngiven  the  opportunity.  There are private doctors  who  are\r\n\r\nwilling to come to the public sector on the same remuneration\r\n\r\nas the public doctors, if given the chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to doctors in public hospitals, integration\r\n\r\nwould  mean the chance to practise in the private  sector  in\r\n\r\nwhatever  form  that  is evolved in  time.   Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry can always specify that only those who have attained\r\n\r\na  certain degree of seniority and expertise are eligible for\r\n\r\nsuch options.  The effect of this would be:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The eventual establishment of a pool of doctors\r\n\r\nthat  is  in  a continuum of movement in and out of  the  two\r\n\r\nsectors.   In  fact it would be all the better  if  there  is\r\n\r\nmandatory  movement of senior doctors to the private  sector.\r\n\r\nThis  would  make the prospects of promotion and progress  of\r\n\r\njunior doctors more attractive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Now, the integrated system would have the doctors\r\n\r\neventually coming back into the public sector.  The  constant\r\n\r\nhassle  of  the  exodus of doctors from  the  public  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate sectors would be curtailed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the details for a fully workable model for all this\r\n\r\nto  work  can  be  worked  out and  in  due  course  a  truly\r\n\r\nintegrated  system of healthcare can be evolved.   It  is  my\r\n\r\nhope that the Ministry of Health will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlook  into  this issue on doctors and implement the necessary\r\n\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, from\r\n\r\nyoung,  I have always respected two types of people.   First,\r\n\r\nthe  teachers and, secondly, the doctors.  At that time,  the\r\n\r\nSGH and TTSH might not be as good as what they are today, but\r\n\r\nthe  doctors have left a very unforgettable impression on me.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  was  in Primary Five I went to the hospital  for  an\r\n\r\noperation to remove my appendix, and I stayed there for three\r\n\r\ndays.   In Secondary Two, I had high fever and was warded  in\r\n\r\nTTSH for five days.  The doctors there were very professional\r\n\r\nand   very caring to  the patients.  They always tried  their\r\n\r\nbest  to alleviate the fears and suffering of their patients.\r\n\r\nThese  are  things that we do not see commonly  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nnowadays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young doctors in the outpatient department care only\r\n\r\nfor high efficiency.  They only think about how many patients\r\n\r\nthey  can  see every day, but  do not care about the feelings\r\n\r\nof   the   patients  and  their  family  members.   Generally\r\n\r\nspeaking, the doctors have blank faces.  They do not  have  a\r\n\r\ncaring  heart.   They  do not want to  communicate  with  the\r\n\r\npatients.  And some friends have told me that doctors in  the\r\n\r\nhospitals  say  only two words, \"How\" and  \"Next\".  They  are\r\n\r\nmechanical.   They are all the same.  Let me  illustrate  the\r\n\r\n\"how\" and the \"next\" in this short episode:\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother took leave to take her sick child to see the\r\n\r\ndoctor  in  the  hospital.  They waited for a few  hours  and\r\n\r\nfinally, their turn came  to see the doctor.  The doctor took\r\n\r\na  look  at  the worrying mother and the sleepy  child,   and\r\n\r\nasked   expressionlessly,   \"How?\".    The   mother   replied\r\n\r\nnervously,  \"My  son has a high fever and is coughing.\"   The\r\n\r\ndoctor took the temperature, checked the throat of the  child\r\n\r\nand  wrote  the  prescription in quick succession.   He  then\r\n\r\nlooked up and said to the nurse, \"Next!\"  Everything was done\r\n\r\nvery mechanically and without showing any feeling or emotion.\r\n\r\nThis  description  may  be  somewhat  exaggerated,  but  many\r\n\r\npatients and myself have the same feeling\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat our doctors have been more mechanical than caring.  They\r\n\r\nare  too  focused  on efficiency.  This is like  operating  a\r\n\r\nproduction  line  in the factory. I do not think  this  is  a\r\n\r\ngood thing for doctors to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have also told me that there seems to be a\r\n\r\nlack  of  urgency in the A&E Department in the  hospital.   I\r\n\r\nfeel  we  should  review the mode of  operation  at  the  A&E\r\n\r\nDepartment.   We  must understand that  to  the  patients  an\r\n\r\nillness is an illness. To them, if they do not feel well, the\r\n\r\nmatter  is  serious and it requires immediate attention.  The\r\n\r\npatients and their family members are naturally very  anxious\r\n\r\nand  they regard their cases to be the most serious among all\r\n\r\nthe patients, especially when the patients are young children\r\n\r\nor old people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is best to have a screening system at the A&E\r\n\r\nDepartment  whereby  the  nurses will  examine  the  patients\r\n\r\nimmediately   upon  their  arrival,  and  make   professional\r\n\r\njudgement to decide on how the case should be classified  and\r\n\r\ndealt with accordingly.  The cases could be classified as  A:\r\n\r\ncritically ill, and B: emergency.   The A&E Department should\r\n\r\nhave  two  clinics: Clinic A to deal with the  critically  or\r\n\r\nlife-threatening cases, while Clinic B will deal  with  other\r\n\r\nnot  life-threatening but emergency  cases.    As  for  other\r\n\r\nailments,  such  as  cough and cold, flu,  fever,  etc,  they\r\n\r\nshould be streamed to the non-emergency departments.  In this\r\n\r\nway,  you  can  lighten the workload of doctors  at  the  A&E\r\n\r\nDepartment. At the same time, there should be more doctors on\r\n\r\nduty  at the A&E department. Otherwise, doctors on duty  will\r\n\r\nbe  over-stressed and will lose their zeal to attend  to  the\r\n\r\npatients.   Sooner  or later, they will  become  doctors  who\r\n\r\ncould  say  only two words - \"How\" and \"Next\".   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health can look into this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the 1998 National\r\n\r\nHealth  Survey found that Singaporeans above the age  of  50,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those above 60 years old have the  most  health\r\n\r\nrisks.   Many in this age group suffer from high cholesterol,\r\n\r\nhigh blood pressure and high blood sugar\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontent.

Whilst we invest millions of dollars towards  medical\r\n\r\ntreatment,  I  hope the Ministry of Health could  also  spend\r\n\r\nmuch thought and more budget on preventive measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to urge the Ministry of Health to\r\n\r\nconsider tax incentives for employers who invest in workplace\r\n\r\nhealth programmes to help their employees stay healthy,  like\r\n\r\nthose   schemes  we  have  in  place  to  provide  for  those\r\n\r\nindustries who promote industrial safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a Government who cares and recognises that\r\n\r\nhealthcare  must  be  of high quality  and  affordable.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has instituted many schemes and programmes towards\r\n\r\nthis end.  The 3Ms - Medisave, MediShield and Medifund -  are\r\n\r\nprime  examples.  However, our challenge remains.  How do  we\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  premium and co-payment for  Medisave  will\r\n\r\nremain  affordable?  There are literatures issued by  private\r\n\r\ninsurance   companies  which  pointed  to   the   fact   that\r\n\r\nhospitalisation bills will increase.  Hence, will the 3Ms  be\r\n\r\nsufficient?    Can  the  MediShield  remain  affordable   and\r\n\r\neffective,  such  that the premium, the  co-payment  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  illnesses excluded from prior coverage  will  not\r\n\r\nrise?   And  moreover,  how do we assure  Singaporeans  that,\r\n\r\ndespite  the  escalating  hospitalisation  bills,  they  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  have  sufficient savings  or  monies  in  their\r\n\r\nMedisave accounts?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, my concern is something which I\r\n\r\nhave  constantly raised and that is the cost  of  healthcare,\r\n\r\nand I say this, particularly, for our people who are not well\r\n\r\noff.   I  am  concentrating on those whose  income  is  below\r\n\r\n$2,000 a month.  I once previously asked for a breakdown\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the cost to the Government of maintaining a patient in  a\r\n\r\nClass C ward.  I got a general answer, there was no breakdown\r\n\r\ngiven,  but  a general answer about the land cost  that  goes\r\n\r\ninto  the  cost and what else goes into it.  Can we not  have\r\n\r\nsomething  which  the  ordinary man can understand,  a  White\r\n\r\nPaper  on how much it costs the Government to keep a  patient\r\n\r\nin a Class C ward for a day, saying exactly what the cost is,\r\n\r\nand  how  it  is provided for so that the citizens  may  then\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  problems of the Government and  be  able  to\r\n\r\nappreciate what the Government is trying to do?  So  will  it\r\n\r\nbe  possible  now  for  the Minister  to  seriously  consider\r\n\r\nputting  out  a White Paper on the cost to the Government  of\r\n\r\nproviding  healthcare in Class C and Class B2  wards  because\r\n\r\nthat is where they say the subsidy is the greatest?  Then  we\r\n\r\nwill understand what the subsidy is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, before I sit down, may I again renew my plea to\r\n\r\nthis  Government?  Will it consider seriously  setting  up  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  to study the implementation of a health  insurance\r\n\r\nfor  the  whole of Singapore?  Why can we not even  study  it\r\n\r\ninstead of dismissing it?  The object must be to provide,  as\r\n\r\nhas been stressed this morning, healthcare at effective cost.\r\n\r\nIs it not possible that a national healthcare insurance might\r\n\r\nprovide  healthcare at effective cost?  Will  the  Government\r\n\r\nplease  consider  setting up a committee?  It  would  appear,\r\n\r\nfrom  what I heard this morning, that the Government  attacks\r\n\r\nevery   problem  as  it  arises.   Why  do  we  not  have   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive study on what the problems are and how much  it\r\n\r\nwill  cost  the  Government to provide the answers  to  these\r\n\r\nproblems?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, I move this amendment not to\r\n\r\nhighlight  the  problem of casemix implementation  which  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health must surely know, but to share with  you,\r\n\r\nSir,  and  Members  of  this House the  implications  on  the\r\n\r\ncommunity when hospitals are funded using the casemix model.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has announced that, by the year\r\n\r\n2000, that is this year, all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npublic sector hospitals will be funded by case mix for  acute\r\n\r\ninpatient and day surgery.  Casemix funding is supposed to -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) control increase in healthcare costs; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) ensure healthcare is of a high quality and remains\r\n\r\naffordable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learn that the Ministry of Health had started two\r\n\r\npilot  projects at the National Heart Centre and  the  Changi\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospital in May 1998.  The Minister may like to share\r\n\r\nthese  two centres' experiences as to how casemix information\r\n\r\nhas  promoted better management of health services.   Has  it\r\n\r\nimproved   health  care?   That  is  an  important  question.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  the  Minister  would  like  to  respond  to   these\r\n\r\nquestions later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me draw this House's attention to a US report on\r\n\r\ncasemix.   It was titled \"Casemix information in  the  United\r\n\r\nStates:   15 years of management and clinical experience\"  by\r\n\r\nRosanna  M.  Coffey.  This article is dated 31st March  1999.\r\n\r\nIt  is from a magazine called Quarterly Casemix, a US medical\r\n\r\npublication.  This report made certain pertinent observations\r\n\r\nafter  15 years of casemix experience.  I would like to quote\r\n\r\nfrom the report:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Hospitals are treating only the most seriously ill\r\n\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple surgeries are performed outside the hospital.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nursing care has been moved to intermediate-care\r\n\r\nfacilities or is given during home visits.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recuperation is occurring outside the hospital, where\r\n\r\npatients  and  families  have  more  responsibility  in   the\r\n\r\nrecovery process.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the above observations are significant. Not only\r\n\r\nhas hospital care changed, but outside hospital care has also\r\n\r\nchanged.   There  is  need to upgrade and  improve  community\r\n\r\nhealthcare institutions to meet the new hospital development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these have political implications as the community\r\n\r\nis thrust upon to play a greater role of care giving.  Why is\r\n\r\nthis so?  I think this is because the clinical management  of\r\n\r\npatients has changed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndramatically.   Even  for the elderly in the  United  States,\r\n\r\nconditions  that had been diagnosed and treated in  hospitals\r\n\r\nare  now  being handled outside hospitalisation, and patients\r\n\r\ntreated in hospital leave sooner.  Thus, patients admitted to\r\n\r\nthe  hospital today in the US are more severely ill and  more\r\n\r\ncomplicated to treat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, one of the startling results of casemix based\r\n\r\nfunding  of  hospital payment was the expansion of post-acute\r\n\r\nlong-term  care and home care business.  Are we prepared  for\r\n\r\nthis development?  If the Ministry of Health wants all public\r\n\r\nsector  hospitals to be funded through casemix  by  the  year\r\n\r\n2000,   then  the  numbers  of  post  acute  long-term   care\r\n\r\ninstitutions must also expand.  And I do not see the Ministry\r\n\r\nemphasising on this aspect, except a $37.2 million subvention\r\n\r\ngrant to voluntary welfare organisations.  This is out  of  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  $629.38 million subvention grants to  restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals.  Invariably, the voluntary  welfare  organisations\r\n\r\nand  community hospitals are going to bear the brunt  of  all\r\n\r\nthose  post-acute  long-term care.   My  point  is,  we  must\r\n\r\nquickly learn from the experiences of the other countries who\r\n\r\nhave used casemix findings and not reinvent the wheel.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health must move in this area fast.\r\n\r\nThus,  the Ministry must, in the next Budget, make provisions\r\n\r\nfor  the  establishment of these institutions  and  encourage\r\n\r\nmore  voluntary welfare organisations to come along by giving\r\n\r\nbetter  subvention grants to them. We will need  to  move  to\r\n\r\nhigh-end   nursing   care  institutions  and   rehabilitation\r\n\r\ncentres,  apart from the community hospitals, as  the  United\r\n\r\nStates' finding is quite clear that recuperation is occurring\r\n\r\noutside the hospital setting, and patients and families  have\r\n\r\nmore  responsibility in the recovery process. There must  not\r\n\r\nonly  be an increase in the number of such institutions,  but\r\n\r\nalso in the quality of such institutions.  Let me explain why\r\n\r\nquality and special care will be expected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the downsides of casemix funding is the hospital\r\n\r\nmay discharge\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npatients  earlier than needed.  This is what we call \"quicker\r\n\r\nand sicker\", that is, patients are not too well, but they are\r\n\r\ndischarged because of the funding method.  Let me explain  in\r\n\r\nvery  simple  terms.   You see, Sir, if a  case  of  appendix\r\n\r\nrequires  a  four-day hospital stay, you get full funding  if\r\n\r\nyou  discharge the patient in four days.  If you  exceed  the\r\n\r\nfour  days, you will become what the system calls an outlier,\r\n\r\nand  an  outlier is not funded fully.  Therefore, it  is  the\r\n\r\nduty  of  the  hospital unit to discharge the patient  within\r\n\r\nfour  days.   Thus, when patients are discharged quicker  and\r\n\r\nsicker, the need for post-acute institutions to manage  these\r\n\r\ncommunity  hospitals and special nursing  and  rehabilitation\r\n\r\ninstitutions  must surely be the order of the  day.   Let  me\r\n\r\ngive  you some statistics from the United States to prove  my\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1990 and 1997, the number of Medicare (this is\r\n\r\nthe  United  States  Government  funded  health  institution)\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries  using  home  care  services  jumped  from  1.9\r\n\r\nmillion  to  3.4  million. You can see this  sudden  jump  of\r\n\r\nalmost two times.  Home care visits per home care patient per\r\n\r\nyear grew from 34 to 69, again, almost double.  The number of\r\n\r\nhome  healthcare businesses grew 5,718 to 9,147  and,  again,\r\n\r\nalmost double.  Nursing home and home care expenditures under\r\n\r\nMedicare  have  been expanding more rapidly  than  any  other\r\n\r\ncategory  of personal health expenditure, including  hospital\r\n\r\nand  physician services.  Home healthcare, in particular, has\r\n\r\nbeen growing at incredible rates of 20% to 25% per year.  You\r\n\r\nwill observe that there is emphasis on home care services. We\r\n\r\ndo  not have such services but this should be looked into  in\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, looking at the present position of our\r\n\r\ncommunity  care institutions, I wonder if we  can  manage  if\r\n\r\nmost  of our acute hospitals go casemix. Bearing in mind that\r\n\r\nour  nursing homes are always at full capacity, and there  is\r\n\r\nusually  a  long  waiting  list in  the  Government-supported\r\n\r\ninstitutions and VWO homes  ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Dr Tan, you have exceeded the\r\n\r\ntime allowed.  Dr Jennifer Lee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  pick  up  a point or two relating also to home healthcare\r\n\r\nservices and on where Dr Tan has left off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has spoken on various occasions in recent\r\n\r\nmonths,  regarding  putting  in  place  measures  that   will\r\n\r\nfacilitate the provision of nursing home care for the elderly\r\n\r\nby the private sector to supplement the services in this area\r\n\r\nbeing  rendered by the VWOs.  I would like to propose to  the\r\n\r\nMinister that the private sector should also be encouraged to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the  provision of home healthcare  services.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  provision  of this  care  is  not  so  capital\r\n\r\nintensive  as the establishment of nursing homes, there  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  growing  need  and an even larger clientele  for  home\r\n\r\nhealthcare than for institutional care for the elderly.  I do\r\n\r\nnot think that in the longer term, we can expect the VWOs  to\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  meet the home healthcare needs of  our  growing\r\n\r\npopulation. And enabling and supporting families to care  for\r\n\r\nthe ill and frail elderly members at home as far as possible,\r\n\r\nis  very much in line with the philosophy and the approach we\r\n\r\nwish to take.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this to happen, it has to be of interest to the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  to develop home healthcare services.   There\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be  some  change in the funding  principles  which\r\n\r\ncurrently  exist in the subsidy for institutional  care,  but\r\n\r\nnot  for  ambulatory or home healthcare for VWOs, in allowing\r\n\r\nthe use of Medisave mainly for institutional care, and in the\r\n\r\nlimited role of insurance to help the defraying of healthcare\r\n\r\nexpenses for the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that in the report of the Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  for  Healthcare for the  Elderly,  long-term  care\r\n\r\ninsurance was proposed as a component of financing healthcare\r\n\r\nfor   the   elderly.   In  the  subsequent  Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Ageing Population, this proposal underwent a\r\n\r\nmodification  to a proposal for severe disability  insurance.\r\n\r\nIf I read this nuance correctly, the implication is a drawing\r\n\r\nback  from  the  first willingness to consider  supplementing\r\n\r\nfamily financing of an ambulatory healthcare service for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchronic  but not necessarily disabling illness, back  to  our\r\n\r\ncurrent  position  that  supplements  direct  out  of  pocket\r\n\r\npayment only largely for institutional care.  I think this is\r\n\r\ncounter to our efforts, both to promote preventive healthcare\r\n\r\nto  the population, as well as to keep our senior citizens at\r\n\r\nhome  with  their  families and in the community  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will give these points consideration\r\n\r\nand  that  he  will  also  look at the  development  of  both\r\n\r\ninstitutional  and home healthcare services for  the  elderly\r\n\r\nconcurrently  and not defer attention for  the  latter  as  I\r\n\r\nbelieve both sectors are equally important.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, Singapore has a quality primary\r\n\r\nhealthcare  system that is also very affordable.  However,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  we  can still tap our resources  and  better  the\r\n\r\npotential  of  our existing system for the  benefit  of  this\r\n\r\nnation  in the future.  I would like to suggest that we  look\r\n\r\nat  the  following areas to bring our primary  healthcare  to\r\n\r\neven greater heights. Sir, at this juncture, I would like  to\r\n\r\ndeclare that I am a general practitioner in private practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private medical practitioners should remain the main\r\n\r\nproviders  for  primary care.  At the  moment,  they  provide\r\n\r\nprimary  healthcare to about 80% of the patients.   But  they\r\n\r\nshould  be more involved in step-down care from the  tertiary\r\n\r\nand  secondary institutions.  Sir, we need to look  for  more\r\n\r\npractical  and prudent ways to integrate and tap all  sectors\r\n\r\nof  our  available  healthcare facilities.  The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  should devise a scheme to encourage this,  especially\r\n\r\nin terms of shared care and step-down care.  This will save a\r\n\r\nlot  of  wastage on the more expensive facilities and medical\r\n\r\npersonnel  in  our  public hospitals.  Moreover,  when  these\r\n\r\npatients  are transferred to primary care, they also  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  the lower costs, the convenience of seeing doctors near\r\n\r\ntheir  homes  and the luxury of staying in their  homes  with\r\n\r\ntheir loved ones. This will spell efficiency at its best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should induce the primary level care providers to\r\n\r\ncater  for  the  increasing numbers of the  elderly  and  the\r\n\r\nchronic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsick.  Perhaps, they can work more closely with the hospitals\r\n\r\nin  shared care schemes.  The Government can remunerate  them\r\n\r\nin  a  reasonable  and  controlled manner  so  as  to  ensure\r\n\r\naffordability.  The advantages of such schemes would  be  the\r\n\r\nsignificant  savings on cost, the decreased  demands  on  the\r\n\r\nhospitals  in  terms  of  beds and medical  staff,  and  more\r\n\r\nimportantly,   the  positive  effects  of   having   patients\r\n\r\ncontinuing to stay in their own homes with their loved ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive medicine, as the key towards maintaining good\r\n\r\nhealth  in  any  population, cannot be over-emphasised.  This\r\n\r\ntherefore  is  one area we can ill-afford  to  cut  back  on.\r\n\r\nInstead,  we  must seek out all avenues to help  the  healthy\r\n\r\nmaintain  their well-being for as long as possible.   In  the\r\n\r\nlong run, it will be the ministry of continuous and concerted\r\n\r\nefforts  in promoting preventive medicine that would  contain\r\n\r\nthe  escalating costs of healthcare.  The involvement of  the\r\n\r\nprimary care doctors in this, with the encouragement from the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health, will be the way to go in promoting  this\r\n\r\nimportant  area of healthcare. The Ministry should  devise  a\r\n\r\nplan to maximise the relationship of doctors and patients  in\r\n\r\nthis  aspect.   The  availability or the convenience  of  the\r\n\r\ngeographically placed private clinics will be an advantageous\r\n\r\nasset for success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the primary healthcare doctors usually have better\r\n\r\nrapport  and more time with the patients. They are  therefore\r\n\r\nideal for promoting preventive healthcare, especially so when\r\n\r\npatients  give scant thought for preventive care  or  routine\r\n\r\nmedical check-ups when they are not sick.  We have to  change\r\n\r\nthe  mindset of people and reaffirm the idea that  prevention\r\n\r\nis  better than care.  The Ministry of Health would be  doing\r\n\r\nwell  if  it  could  get  one and all to  go  for  preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Minister for Health can enlighten\r\n\r\nus on my proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, I would like to address this\r\n\r\npreventive healthcare issue more at the elderly or  those  of\r\n\r\nus  who are going to be getting old ourselves.  I once  asked\r\n\r\nmy old friend, who was in his 60s,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhow  he was doing. He said, \"Every part of my body is falling\r\n\r\napart.\"  As we get older, this will happen to us too  and  we\r\n\r\nwill  get  sick  more often.  One way to  prevent  this  from\r\n\r\nhappening  is  to keep monitoring ourselves to enable  us  to\r\n\r\ntake  preventive measures in good time.  If we find  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  high  blood pressure, we should start taking medication\r\n\r\nbefore we get strokes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health screening, although not 100% effective, at least\r\n\r\nhelps  us  to  spot these symptoms early.  Most  of  us  are,\r\n\r\nhowever,  reluctant to go for health screening.  Some  of  us\r\n\r\nare  dead scared about it because every time we go,  we  find\r\n\r\nsomething wrong.  And the older we get, the more wrong things\r\n\r\nwe  get.  So, it may be better not to go at all.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nwrong approach, especially for the elderly.  It is vital that\r\n\r\nwe  should detect the signs earlier for us to take  steps  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  risk of serious illnesses and costly  treatment.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to convince them that health screening is not  only\r\n\r\ngood  for  them,  but also necessary. We  know  that  we  are\r\n\r\nproviding,  at  the  moment, some  health  screening  at  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres and other institutions.  We  should  widen\r\n\r\nthe net and catch as many of them as possible. Above all,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to provide this screening at reasonable cost that  they\r\n\r\ncan  afford.  It is not necessary to test everything, but the\r\n\r\nbasic  fundamental tests must be carried out and  if  we  can\r\n\r\nconfine these tests to the essential ones, we will be able to\r\n\r\nkeep  cost  to a minimum. I do not know whether the  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas a programme in this respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, \"prevention is better than cure\" is a\r\n\r\nfact  that  each  one of us here would accept wholeheartedly.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, my parliamentary colleague, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang,  had\r\n\r\njust reaffirmed this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beseech the Ministry of Health to establish firm\r\n\r\ndirectives on promoting preventive healthcare. The successful\r\n\r\nimplementation  of preventive healthcare will translate  into\r\n\r\nquality life for our people and the enormous savings for  the\r\n\r\npeople  and the nation on healthcare cost. Sir, I have spoken\r\n\r\non  this important issue several times in this House and also\r\n\r\nhave moved an adjournment motion on it not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntoo  long  ago.  I would like to re-emphasise that  the  core\r\n\r\ndirectives to ensure success of preventive healthcare are  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Ministry of Health must campaign for a mindset\r\n\r\nof  acceptance in the age-old dictum - \"prevention is  better\r\n\r\nthan  cure\".  Many Singaporeans still believe in seeking  for\r\n\r\nremedy  only  when  they are sick, and  in  many  unfortunate\r\n\r\nconditions, it is too late. An example of this is  when  they\r\n\r\nare  seeking  the remedy for renal failure due  to  the  end-disease  of untreated diabetes or hypertension.   If  we  can\r\n\r\nsucceed in persuading people to look after themselves better,\r\n\r\nhalf  of  our  battle is won.  The Ministry of Health  should\r\n\r\ntherefore  step up health education about healthy living  and\r\n\r\non responsible awareness and care for one's health. Excessive\r\n\r\ncampaigns, with effective use of television media,  may  make\r\n\r\nthe people more responsive, especially when they realise what\r\n\r\nthe  end-results  of many uncontrolled common  diseases  are.\r\n\r\nSir,  do not let the lack of information to the people  cause\r\n\r\nefforts on preventive healthcare to fail.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The other important tool to ensure the success of\r\n\r\npreventive care is to get all doctors throughout the  island,\r\n\r\nnot  just those in public institutions but also all those  in\r\n\r\nprivate  practice,  involved  in  the  whole  concept.    The\r\n\r\nMinistry must, therefore, find ways to engage all our doctors\r\n\r\nin  all  the  different  aspects  of  preventive  healthcare.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  we  should encourage  all  our  doctors  to  be\r\n\r\nmindful of the need to promote preventive healthcare  and  to\r\n\r\nbe  committed enough to consistently influence their patients\r\n\r\non the value of preventive healthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Sir, a more integrated approach, with the\r\n\r\ninvolvement  of  the community, grassroots organisations  and\r\n\r\nvoluntary  organisations, will help in the implementation  of\r\n\r\npreventive  healthcare.  The involvement of immediate  family\r\n\r\nmembers with regard to preventive healthcare for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  aged parents is another important area that should  be\r\n\r\npursued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A \"Department of Preventive Healthcare\" of its own\r\n\r\nshould  be  set  up  in  the Ministry  of  Health  to  ensure\r\n\r\ncontinuity  and  lasting follow-through  of  all  efforts  on\r\n\r\npreventive  healthcare.  It will be the department's  job  to\r\n\r\ncontinuously  identify prevalent diseases that can  be  given\r\n\r\ngreater attention, and to continuously monitor and study  the\r\n\r\ntrends for prevention of common diseases as well as the  many\r\n\r\ndifferent  aspects  of  preventive  healthcare.   Some  basic\r\n\r\ntenets  of preventive healthcare make it necessary  to  adapt\r\n\r\nconstantly.   For instance, whilst it would be impossible  to\r\n\r\ntry  and prevent all cancers on an equal basis, we should pay\r\n\r\nmore  attention to the more prevalent and devastating cancers\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  We need to make sure that essential preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare  programmes are geared to reach the at-risk  folks\r\n\r\nat  the local community level.  We must always remember  that\r\n\r\nthe   morbidity  and  mortality  from  any  disease  can   be\r\n\r\ndramatically reduced when the diseases are treated  in  their\r\n\r\nearly stages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The most important item to success is the\r\n\r\nallocation of adequate funds for preventive healthcare.   The\r\n\r\ndollars allocated for preventive healthcare programmes  today\r\n\r\nwill  enable our people to lead healthier and happier  lives,\r\n\r\nand  also save us the heavy expense in building more and more\r\n\r\nnursing homes and hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure the Minister for Health will have the\r\n\r\nrightful  considerations for this concept and  apportion  due\r\n\r\nimportance for it, so that we can have a lasting legacy for a\r\n\r\nbetter life in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Chiang is not here. Dr Neo, would you\r\n\r\nlike to continue with your next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, Singaporeans are living longer now\r\n\r\nwith  an  average  life  span of about  78  years.   This  is\r\n\r\nexpected to improve further with newer medical advances.   As\r\n\r\nour  population will age at an exponential rate, there is  an\r\n\r\nurgent  need for the Government to cater for the requirements\r\n\r\nof long-term healthcare of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmany  more  people who have chronic diseases due  to  chronic\r\n\r\nillnesses  such  as  diabetes,  hypertension,  cardiovascular\r\n\r\ndiseases  and so on.  It is of paramount importance  that  we\r\n\r\naddress  these issues quickly so that we have a  well-planned\r\n\r\nmedical  system in place to cushion the burdens of  long-term\r\n\r\nhealthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are three areas that we need to consider\r\n\r\nhere:  first,  is  the  financing  of  long-term  healthcare;\r\n\r\nsecond,  is  the  medical care to best  cater  for  long-term\r\n\r\nhealthcare; and, third, is the provision of tertiary care  of\r\n\r\nlong-term healthcare in hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the financing of long-term healthcare, I have raised\r\n\r\nin  this  House  more  than  once the  issue  concerning  the\r\n\r\ninadequacy   of   the   present  \"medi-plans\"   for   elderly\r\n\r\nSingaporeans for this purpose.  I have suggested that perhaps\r\n\r\nanother  insurance  scheme, say, \"Medicare\"   -   a  patient-Government co-payment scheme  -  may fill this inadequacy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am delighted, therefore, that the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Healthcare for the Elderly has\r\n\r\nrecommended  an insurance scheme to solve this problem.   The\r\n\r\nsuccess  of long-term healthcare will be based on  the  basic\r\n\r\ntenet  of  promoting preventive care to prevent complications\r\n\r\nof  chronic diseases.  In other words, help patients to  care\r\n\r\nfor  their  chronic diseases as best as can be, so that  with\r\n\r\nlesser  complications, they can lead a better life with  less\r\n\r\npain to bear physically and financially.  Long-term financing\r\n\r\nmust  be  made  available  to  address  this  area,  and   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  care of patients outside the hospital setting  as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must seriously consider implementing one of the most\r\n\r\neffective  ways to cater for the chronic sick in the  future.\r\n\r\nThis is to get the primary healthcare doctors to care for the\r\n\r\nchronic  sick,  as much as possible, without hospitalisation.\r\n\r\nThere    must  be  greater  integration  between  the  public\r\n\r\nhospitals  and  primary  healthcare doctors  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.   Sir,  I would like to declare that I am  a  private\r\n\r\ngeneral  practitioner.  Encourage shared care  and  step-down\r\n\r\ncare  to  the  primary  medical practitioners,  and  we  will\r\n\r\ncertainly reduce\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  acute hospitals and community hospitals.   Most\r\n\r\npatients  will also benefit when they can stay  at  home  and\r\n\r\nclose to their own families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that chronic healthcare\r\n\r\nrequires that a standard protocol be put in place for chronic\r\n\r\nillnesses  in terms of long-term healthcare financing.   This\r\n\r\nwill ensure better treatment for all the chronic cases.  This\r\n\r\nwill  also  ensure  conformity, in  terms  of  care,  to  all\r\n\r\nconditions.  Patients can also have the assurance  that  they\r\n\r\nare  given the best care as recommended by this protocol  and\r\n\r\nfollow-up wherever they seek treatment.  For example, in  the\r\n\r\ncare  of  diabetes,  the protocol on the frequency  of  blood\r\n\r\ncheck-ups,  eye  testing,  ECG testing  and  so  on  must  be\r\n\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nmake  it  easier for face-to-face discussion of patient  care\r\n\r\nbetween doctors in the public and private sectors.  This will\r\n\r\nbe especially useful in the shared care and step-down care of\r\n\r\nchronic cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Health could enlighten me\r\n\r\nin the issues that I have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, with the aging of\r\n\r\nour  population,  a  lot of resources utilised  for  creating\r\n\r\nwealth  may have to be used to nurse the aged sick.  So  more\r\n\r\nGovernment  policies will have to be formulated  towards  the\r\n\r\nelderly  and  health  sector.  There will  also  be  enormous\r\n\r\nburden   and  responsibility  placed  on  the  fewer  younger\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in looking after their aged sick, and the  price\r\n\r\nthat  they pay will be greater day by day.  Therefore, whilst\r\n\r\nwe should continue to review our health programmes to provide\r\n\r\na  high  standard of healthcare, we must also  intensify  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  cooperation between the  various  healthcare\r\n\r\nsectors  to ensure that cost of healthcare services  for  our\r\n\r\nolder people remain affordable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health recently announced that it plans\r\n\r\nto  increase the private sector's share for nursing homes  to\r\n\r\n40%.  Is 40% the right balance?  How could we ensure that  we\r\n\r\nwill have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadequate nursing care for the aged be provided by the private\r\n\r\nsector,  because  the  commercial  nursing  homes  are   more\r\n\r\nconcerned about business bottom line?  Therefore, under  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  is  it proper to ask the  private  sector  to\r\n\r\nshoulder this responsibility of looking after our aged  sick,\r\n\r\nand to provide them with a high quality of service?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, because of the\r\n\r\nhigher  educational level and the rapid economic development,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are spending significantly more time in  reading\r\n\r\nand  working.  There are more and more people suffering  from\r\n\r\nmyopia,   glaucoma,   diabetic  retinopathy   and   cataract.\r\n\r\nParticularly,  in  recent years, with the  emergence  of  the\r\n\r\ncomputer  and  Internet  and the ever  increasing  number  of\r\n\r\ninternational TV channels, international news and interesting\r\n\r\nevents  can  be easily accessed from PCs and television.   In\r\n\r\nother words, Singaporeans are spending more time on computers\r\n\r\nand  on  watching  television.  As  a  result,  many  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  our  working class people are  suffering  from\r\n\r\nvarious types of eye diseases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a local opthamologist, many primary and\r\n\r\nsecondary  students are suffering from myopia,  and  some  of\r\n\r\nthem are as young as six years old.  When they grow up to  12\r\n\r\nyears  old,  their shortsightedness can be as high  as  1,000\r\n\r\ndegrees.   About 12% of our primary students are shortsighted\r\n\r\nand  up  to  secondary school, about 56% are  suffering  from\r\n\r\nmyopia.  In the  SAF, about 48.5% of the Chinese NS boys  are\r\n\r\nhaving  myopia and among the Malays, 24% of them are  myopic.\r\n\r\nIf  we  do  not  look into this problem seriously,  then  our\r\n\r\nprimary  and  secondary  students will  have  more  and  more\r\n\r\ncomplicated  eye diseases when they grow up.  The  specialist\r\n\r\ntold  me that this is not just simple myopia.  There are also\r\n\r\nmany complicated eye diseases.  This is certainly a cause for\r\n\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the development of the IOL implantation technique,\r\n\r\nmany developing countries are introducing advanced techniques\r\n\r\nof  phacoemulcification to train\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  own  eye  doctors to treat their  eye  patients.   Our\r\n\r\nNational  Eye Centre, established by the Ministry of  Health,\r\n\r\nhas also played a very important role in this aspect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Singapore moving very rapidly into a modern IT\r\n\r\nsociety,  there is bound to be an increase in the  number  of\r\n\r\npatients with various eye diseases.  This is a matter not  to\r\n\r\nbe  overlooked.  I do not wish to see that in the not too far\r\n\r\ndistant  future, Singapore leads the world in IT development,\r\n\r\nand  the  proportion of people in our country suffering  from\r\n\r\nmyopia and other eye diseases also tops the world.  This will\r\n\r\nbe a pity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's budget, I see that only $6 million is\r\n\r\nallocated to the National Eye Centre.  If we want to step  up\r\n\r\nour  R&D,  I  think  this is not enough.   I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health would grant more money for the  study  of\r\n\r\neye diseases to improve the eyesight of our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S.

Member:</b> Keep it short!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, the judgment of good hospitals is by how\r\n\r\nthey treat their customers, particularly the patients.  It is\r\n\r\nno   point   having  good  hardware,  good  buildings,   good\r\n\r\nfacilities, but the people who manage them are not responsive\r\n\r\nin  dealing  with the needs of the patients.  So it  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant for hospitals to be proactive and to see  how  they\r\n\r\ncan  provide  the best for the patients, and I  am  sure  you\r\n\r\nwould agree with that, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we have patients who do not have\r\n\r\nsufficient  money or identification when they appear  at  the\r\n\r\nAccident  & Emergency Department for treatment.   I  know  of\r\n\r\ncases,  from time to time, who faced difficulties in  seeking\r\n\r\ntreatment.   Some of them will have to go back to  get  their\r\n\r\nICs before they are seen.  Others may have insufficient money\r\n\r\nand they are probably asked to raise money for treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the recent case in point at Mount Elizabeth\r\n\r\nHospital would suggest that there are some lapses in the  way\r\n\r\nthat  patients are being treated.  It is a community  concern\r\n\r\nabout how we handle and manage emergency cases.  It would  be\r\n\r\nvery tragic if patients who really need treatment and who  do\r\n\r\nnot  have identification and who do not have enough money  in\r\n\r\ntheir  pocket  do  not get treatment in  time.   And  we  can\r\n\r\nunderstand the gravity of the problem.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this case, I want to find out from the Ministry\r\n\r\nwhether  there are any standard operating procedures to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  emergency  cases.     How do  they  deal  with  private\r\n\r\nhospitals?   Do  they  come under  a  purview  of  audit  and\r\n\r\nsupervision in relation to dealing with emergency cases?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Claire Chiang is not here.

I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the number of kidney patients  increased  by\r\n\r\nabout 500 each year.  The problem will be compounded with  an\r\n\r\nageing  population.  It might not be a shortage of facilities\r\n\r\nfor this group of patients at the moment, but are there plans\r\n\r\nto  cope with the increase?  How many dialysis centres do  we\r\n\r\nneed  in  the  next five years?  With more  and  more  kidney\r\n\r\nfailure patients, the queue for kidney transplants would  get\r\n\r\nlonger  if  supply of kidneys remains static.   More  kidneys\r\n\r\nneed to be harvested for transplant purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Organs Transplant Act may have to be amended\r\n\r\nas  currently only accident victims' kidneys can be harvested\r\n\r\nfor  a  transplant.

Can  the  Minister   consider   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  extending such assistance  to  needy  kidney\r\n\r\nfailure patients?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerald Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerald Ee:</b> Sir, Singapore's only natural asset is its\r\n\r\npeople.   The main way we enhance the value of this asset  is\r\n\r\nto focus on education and training.  Even during the economic\r\n\r\ndownturn, we continued to invest materially in education  and\r\n\r\ntraining  to ensure that our human resource is well  equipped\r\n\r\nwith knowledge and skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One additional way in which the nation can enhance the\r\n\r\nvalue  of its human resource is to ensure that it has  access\r\n\r\nto  various  knowledge bases.  Today, I am  focusing  on  the\r\n\r\nknowledge base of medicines and medical treatments.   Such  a\r\n\r\nknowledge base will be a depository of knowledge on medicines\r\n\r\nand medical treatment, established and experimental, and case\r\n\r\nstudies.  There should also be chat channels so that a doctor\r\n\r\ntreating a disease could share the experience with others and\r\n\r\nalso  benefit from the experience of others.  I believe  that\r\n\r\nsetting up such a knowledge base can establish Singapore as a\r\n\r\nCentre for Medical Knowledge.  It is not a novel idea but  it\r\n\r\ncertainly requires the commitment of a large organisation  to\r\n\r\nachieve  a  meaningful and workable model.  It  is  for  this\r\n\r\nreason  that  I  am  requesting the  Ministry  of  Health  to\r\n\r\nconsider this proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am urging the Ministry of Health to take the\r\n\r\ninitiative  of  setting  up such a knowledge  base  that  all\r\n\r\nmedical   practitioners  and  researchers  can   access   and\r\n\r\ncontribute to.  It should not be restricted to just access in\r\n\r\nSingapore, but it should be opened to global access.  In  the\r\n\r\nsame way, I hope that there will be global participation  and\r\n\r\ntherefore knowledge being deposited from all over the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the knowledge base is designed to provide active\r\n\r\nexchange of ideas, I foresee that there will come a day  when\r\n\r\nno  one needs to  miss out on a treatment that is known to be\r\n\r\neffective  somewhat  in  the  world.   Such  a  database  can\r\n\r\nusefully collate data and establish patterns to provide early\r\n\r\nwarning alerts of potential\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nepidemics and perhaps the necessary course of action can then\r\n\r\nbe taken to prevent it from happening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this is something that the World Health\r\n\r\nOrganisation could participate in and the Singapore  database\r\n\r\ncould be its central source of knowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spin-offs are many. It will certainly help to\r\n\r\nestablish Singapore as the medical centre of the region.   It\r\n\r\nwill  be  of  great assistance and therefore be an attraction\r\n\r\nfor medical researches to be conducted in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well suited to establish such a global\r\n\r\ndatabase   because   of   its   excellent   telecommunication\r\n\r\nfacilities and advancement in the field of IT.  This  is  not\r\n\r\nsomething  that  should  be left to  the  commercial  sector.\r\n\r\nSuch knowledge should be openly shared and not be hogged  for\r\n\r\ncommercial purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mrs Lim is not here. Mr Lim Hng Kiang.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, first, I would like to thank\r\n\r\nall  the  Members who have spoken for their various  comments\r\n\r\nand suggestions.  I will take them up individually and follow\r\n\r\nup, even if I may not have the time to give them a full reply\r\n\r\ntoday.   First, I would like to address the key  themes  that\r\n\r\nare  raised by the Members and then I will take the  specific\r\n\r\nissues point by point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first theme is really how to ensure that we have the\r\n\r\nbest delivery of health care services in Singapore.  In this,\r\n\r\nwe  are talking about how to make the healthcare providers in\r\n\r\nthe  public  sector,  the  polyclinics,  the  hospitals,  the\r\n\r\nnational  centres  work together and how to  get  the  public\r\n\r\nsector and private sector to work together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry announced its plans to reorganise the public\r\n\r\nhealthcare providers into two vertically integrated  delivery\r\n\r\nnetworks   last   November.   Each  network   will   comprise\r\n\r\nhealthcare  providers  ranging  from  the  polyclinics,   the\r\n\r\nregional general hospitals, the tertiary hospitals to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnational  specialty centres. The networks will  provide  more\r\n\r\nintegrated  and  better quality healthcare  services  through\r\n\r\ncloser  cooperation  and  resource sharing.  This  will  then\r\n\r\nminimise  the duplication of services and ensure the  optimal\r\n\r\ndevelopment of clinical capabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vertical integration will involve interfacing the\r\n\r\npolyclinics with the regional general hospitals, the regional\r\n\r\ngeneral hospitals with the tertiary hospitals, and the  acute\r\n\r\nhospitals with the national specialty hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Bernard Chen asked how would the national centres fit\r\n\r\ninto  this  framework and their relationship with  the  acute\r\n\r\nhospitals.  The role of the national centres as spelt out  in\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper remains unchanged after the two networks are\r\n\r\nformed.  The national centres will continue to deal with  the\r\n\r\nmore  complex  cases  requiring more expensive  equipment  or\r\n\r\nhighly  specialised expertise.  They will centralise all  the\r\n\r\nmore  complex cases so that the workload can sustain the very\r\n\r\nspecial skills and expertise needed. Based on this rationale,\r\n\r\nmy Ministry has worked with the national specialty committees\r\n\r\nto  define the level of medical care that will be provided at\r\n\r\nthe  national  centres  and the acute  hospitals.  The  acute\r\n\r\nhospitals  will continue to provide secondary care  in  these\r\n\r\nspecialties, and refer the more complex cases to the national\r\n\r\ncentres.  The  national centres will also be the  centre  for\r\n\r\nresearch and teaching for their respective disciplines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national centres are to treat the more complex and\r\n\r\nrare  medical  conditions, and therefore  understandably  the\r\n\r\nfees would be higher because more resources are incurred  for\r\n\r\nthese  very specialised treatments. We have centralised these\r\n\r\nspecialised  manpower and equipment in the national  centres,\r\n\r\nthus avoiding the higher cost which would have resulted if we\r\n\r\nduplicate all these in all the hospitals. For B2 and C  class\r\n\r\npatients,   the  costs  of  land  and  buildings  are   fully\r\n\r\nsubsidised by the Government.  In addition, they are provided\r\n\r\nwith 65% and 80% subsidy of the running costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national centres are grouped with the network that\r\n\r\nthey are co-located with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nso  that  they  can leverage on the network's  administrative\r\n\r\nsupport.  However, the services and expertise of the national\r\n\r\ncentres will continue to be made available to patients across\r\n\r\nthe  two networks.  Patients from one network can be referred\r\n\r\nto the national centre in the other network and will be given\r\n\r\nthe appropriate level of service and standard of care. So  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  the  patient is concerned, there is no  change.  The\r\n\r\nchanges  will  be  made to the integration  of  the  backroom\r\n\r\nsupport and services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me turn to the integration between the private\r\n\r\nand  public sectors.   I agree entirely with Dr Lily Neo that\r\n\r\nin addition to the vertical integration between the hospitals\r\n\r\nand  the  primary care, there should also be greater  lateral\r\n\r\nintegration between the private sector and the public sector.\r\n\r\nWe  already  have  several avenues  for  the  private  sector\r\n\r\ndoctors  to  contribute to health care in the public  sector.\r\n\r\nLet me give a few examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we have the Visiting Consultant Scheme that Dr\r\n\r\nLily  Neo  also  talked about.  I think  there  is  room  for\r\n\r\nimprovement in that scheme.  Secondly, we involve the private\r\n\r\nsector  doctors  to  contribute their  expertise  in  complex\r\n\r\nprocedures, like heart and liver transplant programmes.   The\r\n\r\ntransplant teams involve doctors from both public and private\r\n\r\nsectors.   Thirdly , private sector doctors are appointed  to\r\n\r\nvarious  committees  to  assist  the  Ministry  to  formulate\r\n\r\npolicies  in  clinical  practice, medical  research,  medical\r\n\r\nethics and training matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has suggested that public sector doctors be\r\n\r\nallowed  to practise in the private sector.  This is  already\r\n\r\ndone. The issue is really how to extend the scope. Currently,\r\n\r\nconsultants  in  the public sector hospitals attend  to  both\r\n\r\nsubsidised  and  private patients. My  Ministry  is  studying\r\n\r\nwhether we could introduce greater flexibility to the private\r\n\r\npractice scheme by allowing public sector doctors to practise\r\n\r\npart  of the time in the private sector. There could also  be\r\n\r\nother ways to extend the scope.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also made several suggestions on the shared\r\n\r\nuse of expensive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nequipment,  bulk  order of standard medical  items,  and  the\r\n\r\ncentralised  sterilisation of medical equipment.   All  these\r\n\r\nsuggestions   are  worth  exploring.   If  it   is   mutually\r\n\r\nbeneficial, I see no reason why the two networks  should  not\r\n\r\ntake this up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I envisage that, with the reorganisation of the public\r\n\r\nhealthcare delivery system, the networks will be able to work\r\n\r\nout  new  and  innovative  ways  to  involve  private  sector\r\n\r\nspecialists  and  general practitioners in the  provision  of\r\n\r\nhealthcare  services and together provide  Singaporeans  with\r\n\r\ngood quality health care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run this system, we need the people. So let me now\r\n\r\nturn to the concerns raised by Mr Bernard Chen and Mr Ibrahim\r\n\r\nOthman.  First, the issue of doctors. Over the past 10 years,\r\n\r\nthe  number of doctors in Singapore has grown  steadily.   As\r\n\r\nat  end  1999,  we had about 5,320 doctors in  Singapore,  or\r\n\r\naround 1,750 or almost 50% more than in 1990.   While at  the\r\n\r\nnational  level we may have sufficient doctors, we  share  Mr\r\n\r\nBernard Chen's concern that the public sector should continue\r\n\r\nto have its fair share of the national talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the re-organisation of the health care system into\r\n\r\nthese  two networks, one of the key tasks of the networks  is\r\n\r\nto  come  up  with  innovative methods to develop and  retain\r\n\r\ntheir  medical  specialists.   For  example,  development  of\r\n\r\ntalent  would  be done across the hospitals in  each  of  the\r\n\r\nnetworks.  The  remuneration  system  would  also   be   more\r\n\r\nsensitive  to  market  conditions and commensurate  with  the\r\n\r\ncalibre of the talent.  The networks will also provide a more\r\n\r\nconducive  environment for good calibre doctors to  practise,\r\n\r\nteach, do research and develop themselves professionally.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  the  two  networks can  be  more  competitive  in\r\n\r\ntraining  and  retaining their staff.   At the same  time,  I\r\n\r\nwould  convey the comments of Mr Peh Chin Hua to the networks\r\n\r\nto  make  sure  that  doctors are more communicative  and  go\r\n\r\nbeyond the two words 'How' and 'Next'?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of nurses, my Ministry is also concerned\r\n\r\nabout the shortage of local nurses. We have to anticipate the\r\n\r\ndemand that would come from the development of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstep-down care services to meet the healthcare needs  of  our\r\n\r\nageing  population.   This need will include  nursing  homes,\r\n\r\ncommunity hospitals and home care services that both  Dr  Tan\r\n\r\nCheng  Bock and Dr Jennifer Lee talked about.  In  the  short\r\n\r\nterm,  we  will need to recruit well-trained foreign  nurses.\r\n\r\nBut for  Singapore, it is better for us, in the long term, to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the nursing profession is attractive  to  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses form the backbone of the healthcare system. We\r\n\r\nwant to encourage capable and bright young people to join the\r\n\r\nnursing profession, to build up the profession and raise  the\r\n\r\nlevel of nursing services.  Over the years, the Ministry  has\r\n\r\ntaken  various  measures to enhance nursing as a  profession.\r\n\r\nBut  I think the key thing is still competitive remuneration.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  have recently reviewed the  nursing  salaries\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the  restructured institutions.  The  nurses'\r\n\r\nsalaries  have  fallen behind those in the other  professions\r\n\r\nwith  people  of  equivalent  educational  level.  There   is\r\n\r\ntherefore  a need to adjust the nurses' salaries so  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  continue  to attract a sufficient number of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto take up nursing as a career. There must also be incentives\r\n\r\nto  compensate  for  the  onerous nature  of  the  job.   The\r\n\r\nrestructured  institutions will, therefore, be taking  action\r\n\r\nto   increase  nurses'  salaries  in  FY2000.  The   proposed\r\n\r\nrevisions  will increase the nurses' salaries by around  13%.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not an  across-the-board increase. We will increase\r\n\r\nthe  starting  salaries  of Assistant Nurses  and  Registered\r\n\r\nNurses by 21% and 10% respectively. Corresponding adjustments\r\n\r\nwill be made to the rest of the salary scales. The new salary\r\n\r\npackage   will  include  better  shift  allowance  and  other\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  better recognise the efforts of the  nurses  in\r\n\r\nproviding  24-hour  care  to patients.  We  expect  that  the\r\n\r\nproposed revision will increase costs for the hospitals by an\r\n\r\nestimated $33 million.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to turn to the second theme which\r\n\r\nMembers raised,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich  is  how  do  we  approach the problem  of  the  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation.  As I mentioned in previous sittings, this is not\r\n\r\nthe  first  nor  the last time we are going to  discuss  this\r\n\r\nissue.   So,  again, today, let me take through with  Members\r\n\r\nwhat we intend to do to address this tremendous challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, the number of elderly persons in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  aged  65  and  above,  is  currently  7%  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  and  will rise to almost 20% by  the  year  2030.\r\n\r\nThis  will put some pressure on our healthcare services.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry recognises that therefore we have to start preparing\r\n\r\nourselves  early and put in place a framework  to  meet  this\r\n\r\nchallenge.  So what is this framework?  As can be  seen  from\r\n\r\nthe  various points raised by Members, I think the first step\r\n\r\nwe  must take is to keep the elderly fit and healthy  for  as\r\n\r\nlong  as  possible.   Second,  to  encourage  regular  health\r\n\r\nscreening so that health problems can be picked up early  for\r\n\r\ntreatment.   And, third, for those who fall  ill  or  acquire\r\n\r\nsevere  disabilities,  there must be  a  whole  continuum  of\r\n\r\nhealthcare  facilities, programmes and  services  to  provide\r\n\r\ncare  in the most appropriate setting to the elderly  and  at\r\n\r\naffordable cost to them, their family and the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doing all these, the public, the private and the\r\n\r\npeople  sectors will have important roles in this  framework.\r\n\r\nSo let me first address preventive healthcare.  These are the\r\n\r\npoints  raised  by  Mr  Bernard Chen and  Dr  Lily  Neo.  The\r\n\r\nchallenge is how to keep the elderly fit and healthy  for  as\r\n\r\nlong  as  possible.   I  think we  agree  entirely  with  the\r\n\r\nspeakers on this.  We all realise that a healthy lifestyle is\r\n\r\nreally  the  key  to the prevention of many chronic  diseases\r\n\r\nwhich can eventually lead to disabilities.  This applies  not\r\n\r\nonly   to  the  elderly  but  also  the  general  population.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  my  Ministry  sets high  priority  on  preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare, health promotion and public education to  prevent\r\n\r\nthe onset of chronic diseases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members are all familiar with the various\r\n\r\ncampaigns that my Ministry runs to educate Singaporeans on  a\r\n\r\ngeneral healthy lifestyle as well as on specific\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nillnesses.   These  programmes  all  adopt  a  multi-strategy\r\n\r\napproach  which involves the media, direct contact  and  many\r\n\r\navenues  to  try  and raise the awareness of Singaporeans  on\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second stage is health screening. Through health\r\n\r\nscreening  we can check whether the various health  promotion\r\n\r\nmessages  that we have put forward have been translated  into\r\n\r\ngood  health.   I  agree with Mr Bernard  Chen  that  regular\r\n\r\nhealth  screening is very useful.  The issue is  what  do  we\r\n\r\nlook for in the screening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware of the National Health Survey in 1998\r\n\r\nwhich  showed  that the prevalence of diabetes,  hypertension\r\n\r\nand  high blood cholesterol level increased markedly from the\r\n\r\nage  of  50  years  and above.  If these  conditions  can  be\r\n\r\ndetected and treated early, then we will be able to avoid the\r\n\r\nhigh social and medical costs associated with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue is how do we encourage regular health\r\n\r\nscreening for the elderly.  As Advisers and MPs, we  do  this\r\n\r\nat  the  constituency level with the help of VWOs  but  often\r\n\r\ntimes,  our best efforts are inadequate.  In fact, those  who\r\n\r\nneed health screening most are the ones not likely to turn up\r\n\r\nfor  the  screening.  Instead, the more enlightened residents\r\n\r\nwill  turn up regularly.  They are also likely to be the ones\r\n\r\nwho  are  more healthy.  Also, our efforts on the ground  are\r\n\r\noften  not  comprehensive enough to  cover  all  the  elderly\r\n\r\ncitizens in our constituencies.  As Advisers and MPs, we also\r\n\r\nhave  limited resources to mount this effort year in and year\r\n\r\nout.  After the screening, I think most of us feel that there\r\n\r\nis inadequate follow-up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to redress all these shortcomings, my\r\n\r\nMinistry will reinforce what is being done now on the ground.\r\n\r\nWe  will  embark  on a systematic National  Health  Screening\r\n\r\nProgramme  in collaboration with the charitable organisations\r\n\r\nto  detect diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol  level\r\n\r\nin  people  aged 55 years and above.  The screening programme\r\n\r\nwould start in the second half of this year.  The plan is  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  screening all 374,000 of those aged  55  years  and\r\n\r\nabove within\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthree  years.   To  make it convenient  for  the  elderly  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in this programme, the health screening  will  be\r\n\r\nconducted at venues near to their homes, for example, in  the\r\n\r\nvoid  decks.   Every senior citizen would be given  a  health\r\n\r\nbooklet to track his screening results.  I think Members will\r\n\r\nremember that this is one of the suggestions put up by Mr Ang\r\n\r\nMong  Seng,  and we are pleased to adopt his suggestion.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  maintain the central database for  all  these\r\n\r\nscreening  exercises.  All those screened and found  to  have\r\n\r\nabnormal  results will be counselled on site and referred  to\r\n\r\ntheir   family   doctor  or  the  polyclinic  for   follow-up\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We plan to extend the screening programme to those who\r\n\r\nare  50  years  and  above when the plan is well  established\r\n\r\nafter  three  years.  We would also like  to  encourage  each\r\n\r\nperson  to  attend  screening  once  every  two  years.   The\r\n\r\nestimated  cost  to  screen each person is  about  $20.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment will subsidise $15 while the resident will  co-pay\r\n\r\n$5.   The participating charitable organisations will pay for\r\n\r\nthose  who cannot afford the co-payment.  The pilot programme\r\n\r\nwill  involve 10 to 12 divisions in the first phase.  I  hope\r\n\r\nMPs will volunteer their divisions for this programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to stress that there is a tremendous\r\n\r\nlong-term  potential  for this mass  screening  exercise.   I\r\n\r\nwould put this akin to the mass vaccination of our young.  If\r\n\r\nwe  can  organise  this  properly, we would  be  taking  full\r\n\r\nadvantage of Singapore as a small urban, compact society.   I\r\n\r\nthink  no  other country will be able to embark on a  similar\r\n\r\nambitious  programme such as this.  I hope  over  the  years,\r\n\r\nsuch  screening exercises in our constituencies  will  be  as\r\n\r\nregular as our meet-the-people sessions that we conduct every\r\n\r\nweek.   I  envisage  that  we will be  doing  this  screening\r\n\r\npractically  once every two or three weeks and systematically\r\n\r\nencourage  all  our senior citizens to go for the  screening.\r\n\r\nAnd  we can help manage the medical conditions for those  who\r\n\r\nhave these illnesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me go to the next stage of the framework. If,\r\n\r\nafter the screening, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nidentify  those with health problems, then we would  like  to\r\n\r\nencourage  them to be managed by their family doctors  in  an\r\n\r\noutpatient  setting.  Most of the health care  needs  of  the\r\n\r\nelderly  can, in fact, be met in the outpatient setting.   So\r\n\r\nit  is  important  for  people with chronic  illnesses,  like\r\n\r\nhypertension and diabetes, to be treated and managed properly\r\n\r\nso  that  they  do  not acquire complications,  resulting  in\r\n\r\nsevere  disabilities.  If we do this well, and if we do  this\r\n\r\nsystematically, then those who suffer severe disabilities and\r\n\r\nrequire long-term institutional care will be minimised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo urged for more shared care programmes\r\n\r\nbetween  the primary care doctors to jointly manage  patients\r\n\r\nwith  chronic medical problems with the specialists.  I agree\r\n\r\nwith  her.   There are some programmes already in place.   We\r\n\r\ncan encourage both the private and public sectors to do more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also commented that private GPs should\r\n\r\nremain the main providers for primary health.  This is indeed\r\n\r\nthe  case,  because  at the primary care level,  the  private\r\n\r\nsector GPs cater for 80% of primary care needs.  In a rapidly\r\n\r\nageing  population, if we can move the centre of  gravity  of\r\n\r\nmanaging  the  chronic illnesses to the  outpatient  setting,\r\n\r\nthen I see the role of the primary care providers continuing.\r\n\r\nAs  I  said  earlier, there is pressure for the primary  care\r\n\r\nproviders  to upgrade themselves and raise the confidence  of\r\n\r\nthe general public in their capabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do so by better training of the family doctors\r\n\r\nthrough  various  programmes,  like  the  Masters  in  Family\r\n\r\nMedicine  and the Diploma in Geriatric Medicine.  If  we  can\r\n\r\nupgrade  the  doctors through continuing  medical  education,\r\n\r\nthen the GPs would be equipped to provide better care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond care in the outpatient setting, both Dr Jennifer\r\n\r\nLee and Dr Tan Cheng Bock raised the issue of home care.   We\r\n\r\nalso  anticipated this requirement.  Just as in the US  where\r\n\r\nthe  acute  hospitals will only look after  the  more  severe\r\n\r\ncases,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere  is  now a general sharing of care through other  step-down  facilities.   In  Singapore, in  fact,  we  are  taking\r\n\r\nmeasures to develop this overall supporting structure.  There\r\n\r\nwill  be  a community hospital next to every regional general\r\n\r\nhospital.    We   are   already   starting   to   build   the\r\n\r\nrehabilitation hospital in Tan Tock Seng Hospital and that is\r\n\r\nprovided  in  the budget for this year.  We have embarked  on\r\n\r\nmany, many nursing homes.  So I can assure Dr Tan Cheng  Bock\r\n\r\nthat  the  full range of supporting facilities for  step-down\r\n\r\ncare is already in place, and the funds are available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how to provide this full continuum to meet the\r\n\r\nvarious  needs,  both from the nursing homes to  the  chronic\r\n\r\nsick  to  home  care?  Dr Jennifer Lee has spoken  eloquently\r\n\r\nseveral times on the need for more home care services so that\r\n\r\nthe  elderly  can  be  cared for in  their  homes.   I  agree\r\n\r\nentirely with her that institutional care should be the  last\r\n\r\nresort and where we can, we should encourage home care.   But\r\n\r\nhome  care is a more complicated and a more complex  delivery\r\n\r\nsystem.  Although we are working on it concurrently, I  think\r\n\r\nMembers will have to bear with us if we take a little  longer\r\n\r\nto  develop  this  full  range of home  care  facilities  and\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have six VWOs who provide home care, home\r\n\r\nnursing  and home help services for about 6,500 elderly.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  is actively encouraging other VWOs to provide  home\r\n\r\ncare  services  and  is also currently working  with  another\r\n\r\nseven VWOs who have expressed keen interest to do so.  We are\r\n\r\nalso  currently reviewing the subsidy framework for home care\r\n\r\nservices  to  ensure that the lower income  group  will  have\r\n\r\naccess to such services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many GPs, nurses and private hospitals are also\r\n\r\nproviding  home medical and home nursing care  services.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  will encourage the private sector to reach  out  to\r\n\r\nmore  elderly  sick  in the homes and  we  will  provide  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  support  to  facilitate the  development  of  such\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond home care, we must also develop the nursing homes\r\n\r\nfor the elderly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith severe disabilities who cannot be cared at home and must\r\n\r\nbe  looked  after in an institutional setting.  Recently,  we\r\n\r\nannounced  the development plan for nursing homes up  to  the\r\n\r\nyear  2010.   Mr  Yeo Guat Kwang has asked  whether  the  40%\r\n\r\nprivate  sector share for nursing homes is the right balance.\r\n\r\nLet me explain the rationale for this decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the VWOs are the main providers of nursing home\r\n\r\nservices,  providing around two-thirds of the  total  nursing\r\n\r\nhome  beds.  As the population ages rapidly, I think it would\r\n\r\nbe  a  tremendous  challenge to find  increasing  numbers  of\r\n\r\nvolunteers  who are able to raise increasing  sums  of  money\r\n\r\nfrom  the  community each year to run the VWO nursing  homes.\r\n\r\nWe  therefore need to establish the nursing homes on  a  more\r\n\r\nsustainable basis.  The VWOs are charitable organisations and\r\n\r\nshould  focus  their efforts on the indigent  and  the  poor.\r\n\r\nThey  should also concentrate on upgrading their professional\r\n\r\ncapabilities and level of care.  If the VWOs can  look  after\r\n\r\n60%  of the nursing home requirement, I would see that  as  a\r\n\r\ntremendous achievement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complement the VWOs, my Ministry will set up the\r\n\r\nprivate nursing home market share at 40% by the year 2010, so\r\n\r\nas  to provide more options to Singaporeans.  We will step up\r\n\r\nthe  development of private nursing homes with the  following\r\n\r\nmeasures.  Firstly, we will help the existing operators using\r\n\r\nthese  buildings  to  secure  longer  tenancies.   This  will\r\n\r\nencourage the operators to upgrade their facilities and their\r\n\r\nservice.   Secondly,  we  encourage  the  private  sector  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  purpose-built nursing homes by tendering  out  sites\r\n\r\nfor such homes.  At least 10 sites, each sufficient for a 200-bedded nursing home, will be offered by the year 2010.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will, of course, monitor and review these plans over\r\n\r\nthe  next  few years, taking into consideration  the  overall\r\n\r\nsupply and demand of nursing homes.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key element in this framework is to be able to\r\n\r\nmake sure that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   can  afford  such  nursing  home   care.    My\r\n\r\npredecessor has announced previously the consideration  of  a\r\n\r\nsevere  disability insurance to meet the high costs  of  such\r\n\r\nlong-term care.  We expect to launch this in about two years'\r\n\r\ntime after we have completed the actuarial study to determine\r\n\r\nthe appropriate levels of premium and benefits.  Once we have\r\n\r\nthis  severe  disability insurance scheme, then  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncan  save  for  their old age and be covered by insurance  if\r\n\r\nthey suffer severe disabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee was concerned that by changing the name\r\n\r\nof  the  scheme  from \"long-term care insurance\"  to  \"severe\r\n\r\ndisability  insurance\", she reads the nuance as a  diminution\r\n\r\nin  the scope of the coverage.  Let me explain that, when  Mr\r\n\r\nYeo  Cheow  Tong announced last year the thinking behind  the\r\n\r\nlong-term  care insurance, he said that this insurance  would\r\n\r\nnot   cover   chronic  conditions,  such  as   diabetes   and\r\n\r\nhypertension,   which   are  not   severe   disabilities   in\r\n\r\nthemselves,  but  require  outpatient  treatment.    So   the\r\n\r\nintention  all along is to restrict ourselves  to  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  to  incur a very heavy financial burden as a result  of\r\n\r\nsevere disabilities.  Members will appreciate that if you are\r\n\r\nrunning an insurance scheme, you want the appropriate pay-out\r\n\r\nratio.   The  more generous you make the pay-out  ratio,  the\r\n\r\nhigher  the  premiums will be.  That has been our  experience\r\n\r\nwith  MediShield.  If you have a pay-out ratio of 1:10,  then\r\n\r\nyou  can  keep the premiums low and everybody can afford  the\r\n\r\npremiums.   If  you make the coverage wider and  the  pay-out\r\n\r\nratio  higher, then the premiums will be much higher.  So  we\r\n\r\nneed  to strike the right balance.  We have changed the  name\r\n\r\nto \"severe disability insurance\" to better reflect the policy\r\n\r\nintention and not to reduce the coverage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this sets out the framework of what we intend to\r\n\r\ndo   for   the  ageing  population.   We  will  continue   to\r\n\r\nconcentrate on preventive healthcare.  We will undertake this\r\n\r\nvery  ambitious programme to screen all senior citizens  aged\r\n\r\n55  and  above and, over time, to bring it down  to  also  50\r\n\r\nyears  old, screening once every two years.  Then those  with\r\n\r\nmedical\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproblems, to manage them in the outpatient setting, and those\r\n\r\nwith  more  severe disabilities, to allow them to  be  looked\r\n\r\nafter  both in the home setting as well as the nursing homes.\r\n\r\nWe  have put in place the financing for the low income group.\r\n\r\nThey will be subsidised through the Eldercare Fund.  For  the\r\n\r\naverage Singaporeans, in two years' time, we will set up  the\r\n\r\nsevere disability insurance so that they can save and pay for\r\n\r\ntheir long-term care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area that I would like to cover is the whole\r\n\r\nissue  of affordable healthcare.  This was raised by  Mr  Low\r\n\r\nThia  Khiang, Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam and also Dr Tan Cheng Bock.\r\n\r\nMr  J.  B.  Jeyaretnam is not around.  Every time he  is  not\r\n\r\naround,  he  does not listen to our answers,  the  next  time\r\n\r\nround,  he  will  ask  the same question.   He  asked  for  a\r\n\r\ncommittee   to  be  set  up  to  study  national   healthcare\r\n\r\ninsurance.   In fact, that committee was set up in  1992  and\r\n\r\nthe White Paper on affordable healthcare was a result of that\r\n\r\ncommittee.   That  committee  deliberated  and  decided  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  not  have a national  healthcare  insurance\r\n\r\nsystem,  but  our  system  will cover  the  3Ms  -  Medisave,\r\n\r\nMediShield  and Medifund.  Today, our healthcare  expenditure\r\n\r\nconstitutes approximately 3.1% of our GDP.  So this  is  very\r\n\r\naffordable  and  it  is a very good level  of  care  at  very\r\n\r\nreasonable  cost.  The national healthcare expenditure  means\r\n\r\nthe  total expenditure by the country, people, employers  and\r\n\r\nthe Government.  If you look at the household expenditure  on\r\n\r\nhealthcare  alone, it is only 2.5% of household  expenditure.\r\n\r\nIndividual households spend on an average 2.5% on healthcare.\r\n\r\nThis is again very affordable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have done so because of this very sound 3M\r\n\r\nfinancing framework - Medisave, MediShield and Medifund.  For\r\n\r\nMedisave, 84% of our people have Medisave accounts.  This  is\r\n\r\na very high percentage.  But I think we can do more.  We will\r\n\r\nwant  as  many  as possible to have Medisave  accounts.   71%\r\n\r\ntoday are covered by MediShield, insurance or its equivalent.\r\n\r\nThis is again a very high level\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  medical insurance.  So instead of the national healthcare\r\n\r\ninsurance  that Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam talked about,  first,  we\r\n\r\nask people to save through Medisave and then we put people on\r\n\r\nto  MediShield and equivalent catastrophic insurance schemes.\r\n\r\nAnd  71% of our people are covered by MediShield.  For  those\r\n\r\nwho  cannot afford to pay their bills, they can apply through\r\n\r\nthe   Medifund  for  assistance.   Last  year,  97%  of   all\r\n\r\napplications for Medifund was approved.  In the FY99  budget,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has topped up the Medifund by  an  additional\r\n\r\n$100 million, bringing the total now to $700 million.  So our\r\n\r\nhealthcare financing scheme is very robust and helps keep our\r\n\r\nhealthcare costs down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam asked for a breakdown in the cost.\r\n\r\nEvery patient who goes to the hospital gets this breakdown in\r\n\r\ncost,  systematically setting out how much it costs  to  look\r\n\r\nafter him, whether he is a C or B2 class patient and what  he\r\n\r\nhas  to pay and what is the Government subvention.  A typical\r\n\r\nhospital  bill for a C class patient is less than  $700.   We\r\n\r\ntrack  this all the time.  And the Government subsidises  80%\r\n\r\nof the total cost.  So the breakdown of the cost is given for\r\n\r\nevery bill that every patient gets from the hospital.   So  I\r\n\r\ndo not quite understand what Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam wants when he\r\n\r\nasked for a breakdown.  It happens all the time in every case\r\n\r\nin hospital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also touch on the implementation of the casemix\r\n\r\nand  some of the issues raised by Dr Tan Cheng Bock.   He  is\r\n\r\nconcerned that casemix may lead to premature discharge and  a\r\n\r\npoorer  quality  of care.  First, let me state  that  casemix\r\n\r\ndoes not dictate to the doctors in all the hospitals how they\r\n\r\nshould  manage their patients, nor does it help hospitals  or\r\n\r\nclinicians decide when to discharge the patients.  As always,\r\n\r\nthe   patient   shall  only  be  discharged  when   medically\r\n\r\nappropriate.  Casemix is only classified after the patient is\r\n\r\ndischarged.   So the whole professional system will  continue\r\n\r\nto   look  after  the  patient  as  before,  based  on  their\r\n\r\nprofessional  judgement.  And the whole issue  of  subvention\r\n\r\nand classification only takes place after the discharge.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock gave the example of outlier cases.\r\n\r\nLet  me  try  to explain this to the House.  Casemix  assumes\r\n\r\ncertain  standard  cases,  say,  for  example,  the  case  of\r\n\r\nappendicitis  that  Dr Tan mentioned.  In  general  standard,\r\n\r\ntypical  cases, it will take about four days and  the  person\r\n\r\nwill  be  well enough to be discharged.  If the case is  more\r\n\r\ncomplex  and  requires seven days for  him  to  stay  in  the\r\n\r\nhospital,  the doctors will continue to keep the patient  for\r\n\r\nseven  days  in  the  hospital.  At  the  end,  when  he  has\r\n\r\nrecovered, he will be discharged based on the decision of the\r\n\r\ndoctors.  In the subvention for the subsidies, the Government\r\n\r\nwill  pay  to  the hospitals the four-day standard  rate  for\r\n\r\nappendicitis, in this example.  And for the three days extra,\r\n\r\nthe  Government will continue to pay the hospital a  per  day\r\n\r\nrate.   So it is not true that the hospital is under pressure\r\n\r\nto  discharge the patient because he wants to stay under  the\r\n\r\nfour-day  standard  rate.   If it is  an  outlier  case,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will continue to pay both the standard  rate  plus\r\n\r\nthe  extra days on a per day basis.  So I want to assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  the casemix system will not result in  premature\r\n\r\ndischarge of the patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock is absolutely right about this shift\r\n\r\nin  the  management  of patients because  we  recognise  that\r\n\r\nhospitals  are  very expensive institutions and  they  should\r\n\r\nconcentrate on acute care.  As can be seen in many  developed\r\n\r\ncountries  and  also, in Singapore, there is a trend  towards\r\n\r\nday  surgery, and there is a trend towards step down care and\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  trend  towards recovery in other  institutions,\r\n\r\nother  than the acute hospitals.  As I mentioned earlier,  we\r\n\r\nhave to set up this full range of supporting facilities so as\r\n\r\nto accommodate this shift in looking after the patient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also address Mr Low Thia Khiang's point about the\r\n\r\nquality  of care in our hospitals.  I can assure him that  we\r\n\r\nare able to achieve very good quality healthcare in Singapore\r\n\r\nat  affordable prices, both to the individual as well  as  to\r\n\r\nthe  country  as a whole, and this is not at the  expense  of\r\n\r\nquality.   When we audit the hospitals, we look at  four  key\r\n\r\nparameters.  First, accessibility, to make sure that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neverybody  has full access to the services and facilities  in\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals, and nobody is turned away because  he  cannot\r\n\r\nafford to pay.  Second, the charges are affordable.  We track\r\n\r\nthe  total  bill size.  We track the cost to the patient  for\r\n\r\nthe  different  ward classes.  Third, we track  the  clinical\r\n\r\noutcomes of all the major operations in the hospital.  So  it\r\n\r\nis  not good enough that you can go into a hospital, the cost\r\n\r\nis  affordable, we also track the clinical outcomes that when\r\n\r\nyou  go  in  for a particular ailment, you come out  properly\r\n\r\ncured.   The clinical outcomes are rated with other reputable\r\n\r\nhospitals  around  the world.  Fourth, we check  the  service\r\n\r\nquality - how the staff deals with the public, whether it  is\r\n\r\nthe  waiting  time,  courtesy,  the  whole  range  of  PS  21\r\n\r\nparameters that we also set for our hospitals.  We do monitor\r\n\r\nthe performance of our hospitals in a very rigorous way.   We\r\n\r\nare  mindful  that we want to ensure good quality  affordable\r\n\r\nhealthcare  to Singaporeans, and not just look at the  bottom\r\n\r\nline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even though the patient load has gone up, the\r\n\r\nhospital  manpower may not have gone up as  much  because  of\r\n\r\nproductivity and efficiency.  But as I said earlier, we  must\r\n\r\nkeep our fair share of doctors, nurses and the whole array of\r\n\r\npeople  to  run the hospitals, and we must continue  to  keep\r\n\r\npace  with the market remuneration.  This means the  cost  to\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals will go up.  The Government will bear its fair\r\n\r\nshare  of these cost increases through higher subventions  to\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals.  But the public must also pay for their share\r\n\r\nof the increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare is an expensive business because 60% of\r\n\r\nhealthcare is in manpower cost.  It is not possible for us to\r\n\r\nask the doctors and nurses to give us good quality healthcare\r\n\r\nand expect them not to receive their fair salary.  We have to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to give them a fair remuneration and that means  we\r\n\r\nexpect 60% of our cost to be increased every year.  Drugs are\r\n\r\nalso very expensive.  They constitute 10% of our cost and  we\r\n\r\nmust expect to deal with better drugs, new medical technology\r\n\r\nand  Singaporeans' expectations that they get the  new  drugs\r\n\r\nwhich are available in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarket.  So there is an increasing pressure on cost.  We will\r\n\r\nmanage  it  well.  But at the same time, as I mentioned,  the\r\n\r\nhealthcare  burden on Singaporeans is manageable  because  of\r\n\r\nthe medical financing that we have put in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to ask my Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto take over and answer the specific questions.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Sir, both Mr Low Thia Khiang, as well as\r\n\r\nMr  Peh  Chin  Hua, mentioned A&E services and  long  waiting\r\n\r\ntime,  quoting  some people having to wait  for  one  or  two\r\n\r\nhours.   I  would like to say that in A&E, we aim  to  triage\r\n\r\npatients within five to ten minutes of their arrival.   After\r\n\r\ntriage, patients are treated based on how serious his medical\r\n\r\nemergency is, not on a first-come-first-served basis. We  can\r\n\r\nassure  Mr  Low,  as  well as Mr Peh, that  all  the  genuine\r\n\r\nemergency cases are given treatment in good time. The average\r\n\r\nwaiting  time in A&E is perhaps long, because we continue  to\r\n\r\nhave  plenty of non-emergency cases coming to A&E Department.\r\n\r\nWe  certainly agree with Mr Peh Chin Hua that to the  friends\r\n\r\nand  relatives of some patients, everything is an  emergency,\r\n\r\nperhaps because of lack of knowledge. That is why we have  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  mount  public education exercise  to  tell  the\r\n\r\npublic how to identify emergency situation and where to bring\r\n\r\nthe  patients to if it is a non-emergency case.   As  Members\r\n\r\nalso  know, we have a two-tier system of charging people  who\r\n\r\ncome  to  A&E Department, higher charge for the non-emergency\r\n\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua is also concerned about eye problems\r\n\r\namong  our  population,  citing  myopia,  cataract,  diabetic\r\n\r\nretinopathy,  as well as glaucoma. Yes, we agree  that  these\r\n\r\nare  all  serious  concerns  and  problems.  The  last  three\r\n\r\nconditions, cataract, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma,  are\r\n\r\nrelated  to an ageing population. The strategy to  deal  with\r\n\r\nsuch\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconditions  really is \"prevention is better  than  cure\".  We\r\n\r\nwill look into organising more screening activities to try to\r\n\r\nidentify  such conditions early, so that early treatment  can\r\n\r\nfollow.   Myopia,  on the other hand, is  a  serious  problem\r\n\r\namongst  our  younger  generation as  Mr  Peh  Chin  Hua  has\r\n\r\nmentioned,  citing  some  very  pertinent  statistics.    One\r\n\r\nproblem  is that it has got so prevalent that I know of  many\r\n\r\nparents, when their children start wearing glasses,  they  do\r\n\r\nnot feel sufficiently upset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will try to intensify public education programme in\r\n\r\norder  to  persuade  members of the  family  to  pay  serious\r\n\r\nattention  to  this  problem. We will also mount  educational\r\n\r\nprogrammes in schools and for parents on proper lighting,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  proper  inculcation of good reading  habits.   Some\r\n\r\nschools  have even introduced eye exercises. We will also  be\r\n\r\nembarking   on  a  national  myopia  programme  to   increase\r\n\r\nawareness of myopia amongst all Singaporeans, to educate them\r\n\r\non the preventive measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as research on eye problems is concerned, we\r\n\r\nwould  like to assure Mr Peh that this is indeed a  priority.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  it  is so important that in 1997, we  set  up  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Eye  Research Institute (SERI) to  function  as  a\r\n\r\nresearch  arm of the Singapore National Eye Centre.  We  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  stingy  on  funding  for  research.  To-date,  the\r\n\r\nNational  Medical Research Council has committed $27  million\r\n\r\nto  various  subjects of eye research. This amount  has  been\r\n\r\ncommitted  but it may not have been spent yet.  As you  know,\r\n\r\nthe money is spent as and when the research is introduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo mentioned asthma amongst children. Yes, we\r\n\r\nconsider  this as an important medical concern.  In terms  of\r\n\r\ndeath  rate  from asthma in Singapore, it is  not  abnormally\r\n\r\nhigher  than those in the developed countries. However,  over\r\n\r\nthe  years,  various initiatives have been put in place.  The\r\n\r\nSchool  Health Service currently screens all students  during\r\n\r\ntheir  annual check-ups for their suggestive history or signs\r\n\r\nof asthma and refer them for treatment where appropriate. KKH\r\n\r\nhas\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso  conducted workshops to train PE teachers on what to  do\r\n\r\nin the event that some of the students suffer an acute asthma\r\n\r\nattack in school.  Standards of asthma care for children have\r\n\r\nalso  been  set  with  the  development  and  publication  of\r\n\r\nclinical practice guidelines for the management of paediatric\r\n\r\nasthma.   A number of hospitals, including KKH and SGH,  have\r\n\r\nestablished  shared-care programme with GPs that  will  allow\r\n\r\ncomplicated  cases of asthma to receive specialist  attention\r\n\r\nearly.   Currently, the School Health Service,  KKH  and  the\r\n\r\nAsthma Association of Singapore are working with the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education on a scheme to equip all schools with  inhalers\r\n\r\nand spacers for emergency use by students who are known to be\r\n\r\nasthmatic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee mentioned IT and the potential of\r\n\r\nexploiting  IT  for professional exchanges, as  well  as  for\r\n\r\nteaching.   We  would like to assure Mr Ee  that  doctors  in\r\n\r\nSingapore today have global access to information on state-of-the-art  medical  treatment  and  knowledge  through  various\r\n\r\nmeans.   Mr Gerard Ee also mentioned Internet.  In  fact,  he\r\n\r\nwould  agree  that our doctors are very Internet  savvy.   In\r\n\r\naddition  to Internet, our doctors have also been  active  in\r\n\r\nparticipating  in  local,  as well as  international  medical\r\n\r\nconferences,  and that includes tele-conferences  to  discuss\r\n\r\nwith  their  colleagues on the medical treatment of  patients\r\n\r\nand  all  these are done regionally, some are done  globally.\r\n\r\nSome of our hospitals have, in fact, established professional\r\n\r\nlinks  with renowned medical centres overseas, such  as  Mayo\r\n\r\nClinic,  Stanford  and Johns Hopkins in  the  United  States.\r\n\r\nSuffice to say that there are really a lot of initiatives  in\r\n\r\nthese  areas. I think we should allow the enthusiasm and  the\r\n\r\ninitiatives to take its course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our health administration here has also been\r\n\r\nvery  active in exploiting IT for health administration,  and\r\n\r\nin  the  use  of  info-communications technology  to  capture\r\n\r\npatients' records for use within the hospitals. The  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas   set  out  to  develop  a  National  Info-communications\r\n\r\nMasterplan for Health.  The concept is being studied with the\r\n\r\nmedical community, not only for the public sector, but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso with private hospitals.  Universities, IT vendors and so\r\n\r\non  have  all been invited to give input on what they  expect\r\n\r\nout of this Info-communications Masterplan.  Of course, there\r\n\r\nare  quite a lot of professional and ethical issues involved.\r\n\r\nWe  will examine these carefully when we establish the  Info-communications Masterplan.  But suffice to say that Mr Gerard\r\n\r\nEe's suggestion of using IT is something that we share.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Chan, just to remind you that\r\n\r\nwe have another amendment to take.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> If that is the case, I will just\r\n\r\naddress Dr Vasoo's point of patients coming to hospitals  not\r\n\r\ncarrying documents with them, and as a result, have no  money\r\n\r\nto  pay for the deposit, and unable to be admitted.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to say that all hospitals are required by law to  admit\r\n\r\nall  emergency cases. They are supposed to treat  them  first\r\n\r\nand  talk  about  administration and money  later.   This  is\r\n\r\nprovided  for  in the law.  As for the case of  the  Filipina\r\n\r\nlady, investigation is in progress.  We would like to get  to\r\n\r\nthe  bottom  of  the matter.  But since investigation  is  in\r\n\r\nprogress,  I think we should leave things as it  is  for  the\r\n\r\ntime being.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I would like to seek a clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister. Earlier on, the Minister said  that  the\r\n\r\nlong-term  disability  insurance  would  not  cover   chronic\r\n\r\ndiseases.  May I ask the Minister: are we not leaving a crack\r\n\r\nin  our  financing  system in medical  care  because  chronic\r\n\r\ndisease  sufferers  in the future will  be  flocking  to  our\r\n\r\nhospitals as these are places where they can get paid through\r\n\r\nMedifund, Medisave and Medicare?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Hiang:</b> Sir, my Parliamentary Secretary also\r\n\r\nleft  out the answer to Mr Gerard Ee on the hospital of hope.\r\n\r\nI  will take this up first.  We thank him for his suggestion,\r\n\r\nbut  I think it is too ambitious a programme for us to embark\r\n\r\non. We do have today research programmes, experimental drugs,\r\n\r\nexperimental  treatments  that  people  who  may  not   avail\r\n\r\nthemselves of standard treatment can go for. But to expand it\r\n\r\ninto a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhospital of hope is too huge a programme for us to undertake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Dr Lily Neo's point about chronic illnesses, we\r\n\r\nwill  keep  an open mind. I just want to lay out the  general\r\n\r\nprinciples. When we start talking about insurance,  there  is\r\n\r\ntrade-off  between  premiums and  pay-outs.   The  wider  the\r\n\r\ncoverage,  the  more pay-outs.  If we include  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\nchronic illnesses, then you must expect a very high level  of\r\n\r\ninsurance premiums. Just to give you an example.  In Germany,\r\n\r\nthey  have a similar long-term care insurance.  For them,  it\r\n\r\nmeans  every worker setting aside 1% of his salary  from  the\r\n\r\nday he starts work until 65. That money that he saves becomes\r\n\r\nthe  premium to pay for long-term care insurance. That is the\r\n\r\nkind of money we are talking about.  The more you are able to\r\n\r\nnarrow  the  pay-outs, the more affordable the  premiums.  We\r\n\r\nkeep  an  open  mind.  We would like  to  cover  as  wide  as\r\n\r\npossible, but insurance means that somebody in the end  would\r\n\r\nhave to pay.  Our experience with MediShield is that the more\r\n\r\nnarrow  you  can  keep the pay-out, the more affordable,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore the easier it is for you to encourage everybody  to\r\n\r\nbuy into the programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have two minutes left on this\r\n\r\namendment. Dr Tan, make your clarification quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, I just want to clarify with the\r\n\r\nMinister  about the funding of outliers.  He said  that  they\r\n\r\nwould  be  funded. I agree that they would be funded  but  at\r\n\r\nwhat level.  Is it below the level of the running cost of the\r\n\r\nhospital?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me just say that the bottomline\r\n\r\nis  that we are subventing the hospital at the same level  as\r\n\r\nwe  did before.  It is just how we manage it. For example, if\r\n\r\nyou  discharge your patient earlier, if his medical condition\r\n\r\nis  so  good that he is discharged in 3.7 days, we still  pay\r\n\r\nyou 4 days because it is the standard rate.  If you discharge\r\n\r\nhim  in 7 days, we will pay you 4 days plus 3 days per  diem,\r\n\r\non a per day basis. That is the formula.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, I think the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary should have one minute to answer my question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> He has less than one minute.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, as regards kidney patients, there\r\n\r\nare two key priorities.

Although the Minister\r\n\r\nhas said that medical cost is affordable and also accessible,\r\n\r\nmy  feedback  is  that some residents in my constituency  say\r\n\r\nthat  when  they  want to get admitted into a  hospital,  the\r\n\r\nstaff  insist  that  they  pay the full  cost  for  both  the\r\n\r\noperation  and the ward charges.

They want to make sure that all the services rendered\r\n\r\nare fully paid.  But this may cause some problems to the poor\r\n\r\npeople,  because they are suffering and they  may  be  turned\r\n\r\naway.

For  the hospitalisation that Mr Chiam talked  about,\r\n\r\nnobody  is  turned away in Singapore hospitals  if  he  is  a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen for inability to pay.

It  was like being on an endless roller coaster  of\r\n\r\npolitical  upheavals.   New  fault  lines  have  opened   up.\r\n\r\nPrimordial forces of race and religions have been unleashed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries, people are hungry, people are\r\n\r\nunemployed,  and  people are restless.  Developments  in  the\r\n\r\npast year have been unsettling and discomforting, to say  the\r\n\r\nleast.   Though  the situation has somewhat  stabilised,  the\r\n\r\nproblems  are  by  no  means over.  We must  continue  to  be\r\n\r\nvigilant and on our guard, and not be overcome by surprises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Michael Howard, a well-known military\r\n\r\nhistorian, states that when there is a lull and all is quiet,\r\n\r\nwe  must  all  the  more expect the unexpected.   Events  may\r\n\r\nsuddenly  take a nasty turn for the worse.  We must hope  for\r\n\r\nthe  best, but prepare for the worst, and not be taken by any\r\n\r\nsurprises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time when some people thought that they\r\n\r\ncould  just walk in and walk over us.  Now, there is a strong\r\n\r\nSAF  with the necessary firepower and mobility.  We are fully\r\n\r\ncommitted   to  strengthening  and  upgrading   our   defence\r\n\r\ncapabilities, as without a strong and invincible  SAF,  there\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  a Singapore.  There will not be an independent\r\n\r\nand sovereign Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence budget is $7.4 billion, amounting to 25.6%\r\n\r\nof the total budget allocation for expenditures.  It is 4.48%\r\n\r\nof  our  GDP,  still  way below the 6% cap  of  the  GDP  for\r\n\r\ndefence, set voluntarily by the Government some years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the GPC for Defence and Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\nfully  supports the defence budget.  We hope it is sufficient\r\n\r\nfor  the needs of the SAF.  Our only worry is that it may not\r\n\r\nbe enough.  So, please let us know if it is not enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we are prepared to support a bigger defence\r\n\r\nbudget, we want good\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvalue  for the dollars we put into defence.  Money should  be\r\n\r\nwell spent.  Our defence dollars must work for us.  Usage  of\r\n\r\nland  and  facilities should be optimised and weapon  systems\r\n\r\nwisely selected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wise management and fearless commanders, the SAF\r\n\r\nwill definitely be a force to be reckoned with.  The strategy\r\n\r\nof deterrence, coupled with a balance of power in the region,\r\n\r\nwill  help  protect and preserve our national interests.   We\r\n\r\nwill  then  have  peace and security to pursue  our  economic\r\n\r\ninterests and development.  In this context, I would like  to\r\n\r\nask  the Minister if the SAF is operationally ready to  deter\r\n\r\nand, if necessary, destroy any would-be aggressor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we go for strong defence capabilities, and\r\n\r\nanchor ourselves in the strategy of deterrence, we should, at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  use  other instruments of  geopolitics  and\r\n\r\ndiplomacy.   We  should  make use of the  balance  of  power,\r\n\r\nencouraging  more  big powers like the United  States  to  be\r\n\r\nactively   engaged  in  the  region,  promote   multi-lateral\r\n\r\nsecurity   arrangements,   like  the   Five   Power   Defence\r\n\r\nArrangements (FPDA), engage in security dialogue through  the\r\n\r\nASEAN Regional Forum, pursue confidence and security building\r\n\r\nmeasures,  and  work  on  preventive diplomacy  and  conflict\r\n\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also be aware that the security landscape is\r\n\r\never  changing and shifting, and there could be a variety  of\r\n\r\nthreat  scenarios.   Such threats include terrorist  attacks,\r\n\r\nsubversion,  competition for vital resources like  water  and\r\n\r\noil,  biological and chemical warfare, and even cyber attack.\r\n\r\nMay  I  ask the Minister if Mindef is prepared and  ready  to\r\n\r\ncounter such unconventional threats?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

The SAF\r\n\r\nenjoys  tremendous support among our people.

Tensions on the  Korean\r\n\r\npeninsula still continue.  The multiple claims to the islands\r\n\r\nin  the region still remain unresolved and skirmishes surface\r\n\r\nintermittently.   The nuclear arms race is on in South Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US-Japan alliance is still the cornerstone of US\r\n\r\nstrategy  for the region.  It has been a cardinal  policy  of\r\n\r\nour  Government  to  keep the US engaged  militarily  in  the\r\n\r\nregion,  as  a balancing force.  However, an article  in  the\r\n\r\nInternational  Herald Tribune, which is  carried  in  today's\r\n\r\nStraits  Times,  highlights  that  the  US  will  reduce  its\r\n\r\nmilitary profile in the Asia-Pacific.  Admiral Dennis  Blair,\r\n\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the US forces in the  region,  outlined\r\n\r\nthe  US  military's new approach to Asia and the  Pacific  by\r\n\r\nstating  that  the US intends to achieve this by  encouraging\r\n\r\nlocal armed forces to work more closely together and to  take\r\n\r\nthe lead in any regional crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the DPM to share with the House\r\n\r\nthe strategic situation in the region and, in particular, the\r\n\r\nUS  defence  policy in the region.  Is the  new  US  military\r\n\r\npolicy  for  Asia-Pacific the beginning of  the  end  for  US\r\n\r\ncommitment to the region?  Are we doing enough to keep the US\r\n\r\nengaged in the region?  How could we respond to this  new  US\r\n\r\npolicy  by  participating in more regional military exercises\r\n\r\nwhich  are  aimed at creating better understanding  and  help\r\n\r\nbring  the armed forces in the region together?  Could  these\r\n\r\nregional  military exercises be the harbinger  for  a  future\r\n\r\nregional military apparatus to be created in the region?  And\r\n\r\ncould  it  lead to a future regional military alliance  among\r\n\r\nthe neighbouring countries?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the DPM share Mindef's policies and view on\r\n\r\nthese matters?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, much to our relief,\r\n\r\nthe relationship among the United States, China and Japan   - three  countries which hold the key to the security  of  East\r\n\r\nAsia and South East Asia\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n-   has stabilised.  A small state like Singapore may seem to\r\n\r\nbe at the receiving end of this triangular relationship.  But\r\n\r\nwe  really do not have to and must not allow ourselves to  be\r\n\r\njust  a  small  pawn  in  a  big-power  game.   Through   our\r\n\r\nrelationship with these three countries and  other  countries\r\n\r\nin  the  region,  we  have been training to  help  create  an\r\n\r\nenvironment of peace and stability.  Can the Minister  inform\r\n\r\nus  how  this  approach has helped advance our interests  and\r\n\r\nsecurity?   How  has  our defence relation with  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries developed over the past one year?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the overall security situation in East Asia has\r\n\r\nstabilised,  what  about the situation  in  South  East  Asia\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  economic  crisis and  intensified  separatist\r\n\r\nmovements in areas like Aceh in Indonesia?  Then there is the\r\n\r\npotential  flash  point in the South China Sea.   While  much\r\n\r\nattention  has  been  given to the cross-strait  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  China  and  Taiwan, or North  Korea,  or  especially\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  what  about the situation in  South  Asia,  where\r\n\r\nIndia and Pakistan have both tested nuclear weapons?  Can the\r\n\r\nMinister  give  his  assessment  on  these  matters  and  the\r\n\r\npossible impact on us?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Singaporeans appreciate the Government policy\r\n\r\non  defence  spending, especially in the last two years  when\r\n\r\nthere  were  economic, social and political turmoil  in  many\r\n\r\ncountries  around us.  The policy to cap defence spending  at\r\n\r\n6%  irrespective of our economic situation is appreciated, as\r\n\r\nthe   defence  policy  has  brought  about  confidence  among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  of their own security and among  investors  who\r\n\r\nput  in  their money here.  We have invested much in  defence\r\n\r\ntechnology and equipment.  What about staff development?  Are\r\n\r\nour defence forces able to recruit and retain the good people\r\n\r\nthat they must have?\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the security framework\r\n\r\nof Singapore includes not only the Singapore Armed Forces but\r\n\r\nalso  bilateral and multi-lateral arrangements with countries\r\n\r\nin the region and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npossibly  strategic  partners  in  the  world.   In   defence\r\n\r\nspending, one would say that the SAF has over the years built\r\n\r\nup  substantial  capability, and  this  capability  has  been\r\n\r\nbroadly recognised by many as one that is seriously credible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one would have it, we have built up a credible SAF in\r\n\r\nthe  hope that our soldiers would never have to fire  a  shot\r\n\r\nagainst  another  in  anger.   In  order  to  minimise   this\r\n\r\npossibility, it is important that we recognise  the  goal  of\r\n\r\nbilateral and multi-lateral cooperation with other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we have developed our broader security\r\n\r\nframework  well.  For instance, at a multi-lateral level,  we\r\n\r\nhave   continuously  strengthened  and   worked   with   such\r\n\r\narrangements  as the Five Power Defence Arrangements  (FPDA).\r\n\r\nThe  FPDA  is  the longest standing multi-lateral arrangement\r\n\r\nand  has  provided for the defence of Singapore and  Malaysia\r\n\r\nsince  1971.   One  does not deny that FPDA  has  contributed\r\n\r\nquite substantially to the region's security architecture and\r\n\r\nthe region's business stability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of our efforts at promoting the\r\n\r\ninternational  framework to strengthen security  interest  is\r\n\r\nthe  ASEAN  Regional Forum.  This vehicle  promotes  regional\r\n\r\npeace  and  stability.   At the moment,  although  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nRegional  Forum  is not akin to that which  is  available  in\r\n\r\nEurope,  it  has nonetheless started out on the right premise\r\n\r\nwhich  commits  the parties to the appropriate dialogues  and\r\n\r\ndiscussions to resolve outstanding security issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from multi-lateral arrangements, Singapore has\r\n\r\nbeen  engaged  in  bilateral ties with our  neighbours.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  Singapore  has  very  strong  defence  ties   with\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must recognise that bilateral and multi-lateral\r\n\r\ndefence  cooperations  are  essentially  confidence  building\r\n\r\nmeasures  that help countries in the region resolve  disputes\r\n\r\nthrough  peaceful  means and also to seek  regional  security\r\n\r\ncooperation  to  achieve  common  strategic  interests.    By\r\n\r\nproviding a platform for alliance, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbilateral  ties  and  multi-lateral  arrangements  allow  the\r\n\r\nrespective  countries  to develop cooperative  programmes  to\r\n\r\ncomplement rather than to compete with each other.  In  order\r\n\r\nto  achieve  this, there must be a certain amount  of  inter-operability  of the armed forces.  To this end,  the  parties\r\n\r\nwould  need to cooperate with one another better as  alliance\r\n\r\npartners.    It  is  obvious  therefore  that  by   promoting\r\n\r\nbilateral   and  multi-lateral  arrangements   with   foreign\r\n\r\ncountries,  we  are  providing  a  framework  towards  better\r\n\r\ncooperation  and  understanding at the  armed  forces  level.\r\n\r\nHopefully,  this would pave the way for resolving differences\r\n\r\nby  peaceful settlement rather than to resort to  war  as  an\r\n\r\nalternative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we note that the multi-lateral security dialogues\r\n\r\nand  cooperation  of  defence establishments  in  the  region\r\n\r\nremain a relatively undeveloped area. With various forums, we\r\n\r\nhave  varying degrees of success. For instance, our ties with\r\n\r\nthe Malaysians have been relegated to the backwaters for now.\r\n\r\nWe  should  continue with pursuing closer cooperation.   Such\r\n\r\nties  and  cooperation would pave the way towards a reduction\r\n\r\nof  suspicion of one another, which will be the case,  if  we\r\n\r\nhad no cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister, Sir, whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  pursue this area of bilateral  and  multi-lateral defence cooperation as actively as we have been  able\r\n\r\nto build our defence capabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, the Five Power Defence Arrangements\r\n\r\n(FPDA)  did not conduct the Stardex air and sea exercises  in\r\n\r\n1998. The joint military exercises resumed in the South China\r\n\r\nsea  in  1999.  But the Malaysians had restricted the use  of\r\n\r\ntheir  air  space during the exercise so much that during  an\r\n\r\naccident  the  training  forces  had  to  apply  and   obtain\r\n\r\npermission  from  the  Malaysian  authorities  for  emergency\r\n\r\nrescue  cooperation.  The Malaysians had also indicated  that\r\n\r\nin 1998 they would reassess their membership of the FPDA in a\r\n\r\ndefence review by mid-1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the FPDA is not a NATO-like military alliance. It\r\n\r\nis a regional security treaty\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlinking Britain with Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, and  New\r\n\r\nZealand. The FPDA only requires the three western nations  to\r\n\r\nconsult with the two ASEAN Members should they be subject  to\r\n\r\nattack.   There is no automatic commitment to come  to  their\r\n\r\naid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned as the FPDA, being a loose regional\r\n\r\nsecurity  alliance, requires total commitment  from  all  its\r\n\r\nsignatories for it to be credible and a sound deterrent.  The\r\n\r\nnatural  question that arises is whether all the  signatories\r\n\r\nare  serious about their commitment to the FPDA.   Could  the\r\n\r\nDPM  please  update us on the developments in  the  FPDA  and\r\n\r\nwhether the defence arrangement still has a critical role  to\r\n\r\nplay  in the defence of Singapore?  I would also like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe   DPM  for  his  assessment  on  the  commitment  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysians to the FPDA.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, from time to time, there are\r\n\r\nreported incidents of piracy in the seas around us.

It is situated at the hub or\r\n\r\ncrossroads of Southeast Asia.  Through our port, we export as\r\n\r\nwell  as  import materials and essential food supplies.   The\r\n\r\nsea  lanes  to  and  from Singapore, and  through  the  vital\r\n\r\nStraits of Malacca, are not only our livelihood, but also our\r\n\r\nlife-lines.   We  must  keep the sea lanes  of  communication\r\n\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what measures are being taken to\r\n\r\ntackle   the  problem  of  piracy,  illegal  immigrants   and\r\n\r\npotential  refugees, and if the SAF is able  to  secure,  and\r\n\r\nensure, that the sea lanes of communications are kept open at\r\n\r\nall times for trade and essential supplies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, most of the points\r\n\r\nthat I had intended to raise have already been said by Dr Ong\r\n\r\nChit Chung.

It  requires  the  coordinated  effort   and   the\r\n\r\ncooperation  of regional countries in order to  address  this\r\n\r\nproblem.

And terrorist attacks could happen  at\r\n\r\nany time, any place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that in March 1991, four Pakistani terrorists\r\n\r\nhijacked  Singapore Airlines flight SQ 117 flying from  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur   to   Singapore.   They  issued  an  ultimatum    and\r\n\r\nthreatened  to kill the passengers one by one.   Fortunately,\r\n\r\nthe  SAF commandos successfully stormed the place, killed the\r\n\r\nhijackers  and freed all passengers.  And years  earlier,  if\r\n\r\nMembers remember, in 1974, there was the hijack of the  ferry\r\n\r\nboat,  the Laju.  Indeed, President S.R. Nathan was  involved\r\n\r\nin  this  rescue exercise successfully.  I therefore wish  to\r\n\r\nask  the Minister whether we are ready and able to deal  with\r\n\r\nany terrorist attack, at any time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

According to the report,  the\r\n\r\npolice  authorities  believed that  international  terrorists\r\n\r\nwere  using the Philippines as a training ground,  with  some\r\n\r\nMoro  rebel  leaders  acting as hosts and  getting  technical\r\n\r\nknowledge in modern urban warfare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent times, there have been incidences of hijacking\r\n\r\nof airplanes in the Indian subcontinent, raising much concern\r\n\r\nabout  the security of travelling by air and airport security\r\n\r\nin general.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer to home, arms are easily available in some high\r\n\r\ntension  areas in Indonesia, particularly in East  Timor  and\r\n\r\nits neighbouring areas and in Aceh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is, are our defence forces ready and capable\r\n\r\nin  handling  the  possibility of terrorist  attacks  at  our\r\n\r\nairports  and the hijacking of airplanes?  Would the Minister\r\n\r\ninform  the  House  about  our  capability  in  handling  the\r\n\r\npotential attacks by terrorists?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, as a small nation, with limited\r\n\r\nresources and manpower, we cannot count on mass in numbers to\r\n\r\noverwhelm  the  potential enemy.  In  any  case,  it  is  the\r\n\r\nskills, the firepower, and the mobility that matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our critical mass has to be in technology. It is the\r\n\r\ncutting edge of technology that will give us a cut above  the\r\n\r\nrest,  ensure our competitive advantage, and win the war  for\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was always the danger that the generals were\r\n\r\nfighting  the  last  war.  On the eve of World  War  II,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the Polish Army still had the horse cavalry,  which\r\n\r\nwas, of course, no match for the German tanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same today, even more so with the galloping\r\n\r\npace  of  advancing  technology,  which  made  equipment  and\r\n\r\ndoctrines  fast becoming obsolete.  So fast is  the  pace  of\r\n\r\nchange that there is now a revolution in military affairs  or\r\n\r\nsome call it RMA.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This revolution encompasses electronic information\r\n\r\nsystem,  advanced  information technology,  precision  strike\r\n\r\ntechnologies,  stealth technology, unmanned  technology,  and\r\n\r\ncyber warfare, just to name a few.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister if the SAF is keeping\r\n\r\ntrack of the changing nature of warfare and is on top of  the\r\n\r\nrevolution in military affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Sir, I thank the Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nfor  their  comments  and I will endeavour  to  answer  their\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our economic growth has rebounded strongly and we\r\n\r\ncan all look forward to more growth this year.  There will be\r\n\r\nchallenges, and there will be opportunities.  It is up to  us\r\n\r\nto  meet the challenges and to seize the opportunities.   The\r\n\r\nspeed  of  change  is  quite awesome and  we  shall  have  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to try to ride the changes to our advantage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our efforts to achieve our vision of a best home for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  we  must  never forget  that  our  most  basic\r\n\r\nrequirement  is  security.  For the past 35 years,  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  grown and prospered because we have peace and stability.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  know that they have a safe home, and  investors\r\n\r\nknow  that  it  is  safe  to invest here.   Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nforeign investors alike know that the Government is committed\r\n\r\nto  investing in a defence capability to ensure the  security\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our firm commitment to defence must continue. If there\r\n\r\nis  one thing that the exciting events in our region over the\r\n\r\npast few years have taught us, it is that we would be wise to\r\n\r\nbe  vigilant  and  prepared so that we  can  confidently  and\r\n\r\neffectively deal with any negative fallout from economic  and\r\n\r\npolitical developments elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also learnt how quickly things can take a turn\r\n\r\nfor  the  worse;  in  fact, things can  practically  unravel,\r\n\r\nwithout any\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwarning  - I think a point made very cogently by Dr Ong  Chit\r\n\r\nChung.   And  when the situation turns bad, we have  seen  in\r\n\r\nrecent years how quickly a country can deteriorate, but  also\r\n\r\nhow quickly a country emerges from a crisis situation depends\r\n\r\non  how solid its foundations are and what is the attitude of\r\n\r\nits people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While almost all Asian countries are today well on their\r\n\r\nway to economic recovery, there is greater uncertainty in the\r\n\r\nregional security environment - a point emphasised by Dr  Ong\r\n\r\nChit  Chung  and  Mr  Ravindran.  There are  still  areas  of\r\n\r\npolitical  and social instability and a number of potentially\r\n\r\ndestabilising  issues remain unresolved.   Examples  are  the\r\n\r\nKorean  Peninsula, the Taiwan Strait and the Spratlys.   Time\r\n\r\nand time again over the past few years, we have seen just how\r\n\r\nquickly  such  disputes could trigger  tension  and  threaten\r\n\r\nsecurity and regional stability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would not be wrong to say that all nations today\r\n\r\ndesire peace and stability, and understand the importance  of\r\n\r\nco-operating  for  mutual benefit.  Unfortunately,  it  would\r\n\r\nalso  not  be wrong to say that while we all hope and  strive\r\n\r\nfor peace, conflicts and tensions are very much unfortunately\r\n\r\na  fact  of  life.  As a small and young nation, it  is  only\r\n\r\nprudent for Singaporeans to ensure that we continue to have a\r\n\r\ndefence  capability that is able to protect our  sovereignty,\r\n\r\nterritorial integrity and Singapore's national interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past 35 years, we have done well in developing\r\n\r\nthe   SAF   into   a  well-trained,  highly   motivated   and\r\n\r\ntechnologically   advanced  armed   force.    The   SAF   has\r\n\r\nsafeguarded  our security and given Singapore  more  room  to\r\n\r\nadopt policies and take actions which best serve our national\r\n\r\ninterests.  Without the SAF, Singapore may not have been able\r\n\r\nto  remain  the oasis of calm that we have been,  amidst  the\r\n\r\nturbulence  and  tensions in the region particularly  in  the\r\n\r\npast few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the SAF was not built up overnight. The\r\n\r\nprofessional force that we see today is the result  of  years\r\n\r\nof consistent effort and commitment - in training people,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeveloping doctrines and investing in capabilities.   It  has\r\n\r\nlong been our policy to cap our defence spending at 6% of our\r\n\r\nGDP  and  maintain this in a steady manner.  This policy  has\r\n\r\nserved us well as it allows the SAF to take a long-term  view\r\n\r\nof  its  capability development programmes and  to  structure\r\n\r\nthem  in  the most efficient manner.  Defence technology  and\r\n\r\ndoctrines  are  constantly evolving.   We  must  continue  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a suitable level of defence spending each  year  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  SAF  stands ready  to  meet  any  security\r\n\r\nchallenges.   In  doing  so, we are  saying  to  our  people:\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  remain  a  secure  home  for  you  and  your\r\n\r\nchildren.   We are saying to our investors:  You  can  safely\r\n\r\nput  your money in Singapore because it will remain a  stable\r\n\r\nand secure place for your business.  And we are saying to any\r\n\r\npotential aggressors:  Singaporeans are vigilant and prepared\r\n\r\nto  defend our country against any threats to our sovereignty\r\n\r\nand our vital national interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a result of our commitment and efforts, the SAF\r\n\r\nis today a balanced, integrated and operationally ready armed\r\n\r\nforces.   The  punch of the SAF comes not from its  size  but\r\n\r\nfrom its ability to fight as an integrated whole that is more\r\n\r\npowerful  than  the  sum  of  its  individual  parts.    Many\r\n\r\nestablished armed forces recognise the professional standards\r\n\r\nof the SAF and they are keen to exercise and train with us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come to the point about technology in defence\r\n\r\nwhich  has been raised by Dr Ong Chit Chung.  Looking  ahead,\r\n\r\nthe  advances in technology in the 21st century  will  confer\r\n\r\nnew  advantages  to  a  small  armed  forces  like  the  SAF.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, victory in combat depended on the  ability  to\r\n\r\nmobilise, deploy and utilise larger divisions or naval or air\r\n\r\nfleets.  Skills certainly counted but numbers were decisive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, technology is changing that balance. The\r\n\r\nincorporation  of  advanced technology in weapon  systems  is\r\n\r\nenabling military forces to see the battlefield more clearly,\r\n\r\nmake better informed decisions in a timely manner, and strike\r\n\r\nwith more deadly accuracy, from greater distances\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthan ever before.  The upshot is that in war, having superior\r\n\r\nnumbers  is  no  longer  enough.  What  is  required  is  the\r\n\r\ncapability  to  integrate platforms into a unified,  flexible\r\n\r\nand  effective fighting system.  The side that can  make  the\r\n\r\nbest  use  of technology will have the edge.  The implication\r\n\r\nis  that  even a small country, like Singapore, can tilt  the\r\n\r\nodds  in  its favour if it can make smarter use of technology\r\n\r\nthan its opponents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF is well placed to exploit technology. Many of\r\n\r\nthose   going  into  National  Service  have  the   education\r\n\r\nstandards  to be quickly and effectively trained  to  operate\r\n\r\nhigh-tech weapons and equipment.  60% of each cohort  has  at\r\n\r\nleast  A-level  or Polytechnic qualifications.   The  SAF  is\r\n\r\nconstantly exploiting the opportunities presented by advances\r\n\r\nin  technology.  This goes beyond merely buying more advanced\r\n\r\nweapon  systems.   It also means being able  to  exploit  the\r\n\r\nhardware  to  the  fullest  by constantly  improving  on  our\r\n\r\norganisation, doctrines and training to keep the  SAF  highly\r\n\r\ncapable.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef will continue with our two-pronged approach to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our technological base.  Besides  building  up  a\r\n\r\nstrong  indigenous defence technology capability to meet  the\r\n\r\nSAF's  requirements,  we  will also continue  to  expand  our\r\n\r\ninternational   linkages  and  strategic  partnerships   with\r\n\r\nforeign  armed forces and research bodies.  With the  setting\r\n\r\nup  of  the Defence Science and Technology Agency (or  DSTA),\r\n\r\nwhich  comes into effect tomorrow, we will be able to respond\r\n\r\nmore  quickly and flexibly to technological changes, as  well\r\n\r\nas  to  transcend our manpower limitations by  leveraging  on\r\n\r\nexternal  engineering expertise from either local or overseas\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But advanced weapon systems by themselves cannot win a\r\n\r\nwar.   It  is people who win the war.  And we must have  good\r\n\r\nsoldiers  who  can  make good use of these  high-tech  weapon\r\n\r\nsystems  to  the SAF's best advantage.  Mindef has  therefore\r\n\r\nalways given priority to the recruitment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  retention  of good people in the SAF.  And  I  thank  Mr\r\n\r\nHawazi  Daipi for pointing this out.  We launched a  manpower\r\n\r\nmanagement  initiative in 1998, called \"The New  Partnership\"\r\n\r\nfor  the  SAF  officers corps.  The New Partnership  aims  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  first  class career that is both challenging  and\r\n\r\nrewarding.  The New Partnership programme included changes to\r\n\r\nthe career structure, remuneration package, career management\r\n\r\nand  performance management of the officers.   These  changes\r\n\r\nhave now been fully implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, we announced the New Partnership\r\n\r\nfor Warrant Officers and Specialists who form the backbone of\r\n\r\nthe  SAF.   Under  this initiative, the Warrant  Officer  and\r\n\r\nSpecialist  career  structure will be restructured  into  two\r\n\r\nparts.   The  Specialist stage covers the first 10  years  of\r\n\r\nservice  in  the  SAF  and  emphasises  the  acquisition  and\r\n\r\napplication of skills-based knowledge.  The second stage, the\r\n\r\nWarrant   Officer   stage,  emphasises  skills   proficiency,\r\n\r\nexperience and continuity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan also offers warrant officers more opportunities\r\n\r\nto   upgrade   themselves  and  to  prepare   high-performing\r\n\r\nservicemen  for  positions  of  leadership  by  giving   them\r\n\r\nassistance  for upgrading their qualifications.   To  support\r\n\r\nthe new career structure, Mindef is introducing a savings and\r\n\r\nretirement plan for Warrant Officers and Specialists known as\r\n\r\nthe  Premium  Plan.  This provides financial flexibility  and\r\n\r\nstability to better cater to their needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while a strong SAF remains central in our defence\r\n\r\nstrategy for the 21st century, we recognise that we also need\r\n\r\nto co-operate more closely with others to enhance Singapore's\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 21st century, there will be increasing\r\n\r\ninterconnectedness among countries - not just in the economic\r\n\r\nsphere but also when it comes to security.  The security  and\r\n\r\nprosperity  of  a small and open country like  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nparticularly  vulnerable to developments elsewhere,  many  of\r\n\r\nwhich are beyond our control.  Both our security and economic\r\n\r\nwell-being will become even more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsusceptible to any instability in our external environment as\r\n\r\nwe  become  more closely integrated into the global  economy.\r\n\r\nOur borders may also become more porous to a diverse range of\r\n\r\nsecurity threats, including non-conventional ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to take a more integrated and co-operative\r\n\r\napproach  to  enhance  our security.   At  the  regional  and\r\n\r\ninternational  level,  Singapore  will  work   closely   with\r\n\r\nfriendly  countries  to promote dialogue, confidence-building\r\n\r\nand  co-operation to maintain a peaceful and stable  regional\r\n\r\nand  international environment.  Sir, over the years, we have\r\n\r\nbuilt  up  extensive and good defence ties  with  many  armed\r\n\r\nforces  and  defence establishments all over the world.   And\r\n\r\nthis  is  the  issue raised by Dr Ong Chit Chung,  Mr  Hawazi\r\n\r\nDaipi  and Mr Sin Boon Ann.  We will do what we can  to  help\r\n\r\npromote greater defence co-operation and dialogue - not  only\r\n\r\nwithin  our  region  but also between our  region  and  those\r\n\r\noutside.    By  doing  our  part  to  promote  regional   and\r\n\r\ninternational  peace,  we would also  be  enhancing  our  own\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the national level, Mindef and the SAF will work\r\n\r\nmore  closely  with  other  government  agencies  to  enhance\r\n\r\nSingapore's  capabilities  to  deal  with  a  range  of  non-conventional threats, such as terrorist threats,  piracy  and\r\n\r\ncyber-attacks.  I would like to assure Dr Ong Chit Chung  and\r\n\r\nMr  Hawazi  Daipi that we are very much alive to the  dangers\r\n\r\nwhich  terrorists  can  inflict  on  Singapore.   This  is  a\r\n\r\ndimension  of  Total  Defence  that  will  take  on   greater\r\n\r\nsignificance in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these efforts will not be adequate without the\r\n\r\nbacking  of  a united population committed to the defence  of\r\n\r\nour  country.  Every Singaporean has a part to  play  in  the\r\n\r\ndefence of Singapore.  The SAF's strength comes from each and\r\n\r\nevery  National Serviceman.  As a small nation, we  can  only\r\n\r\nmaintain   an  effective  deterrence  if  we  draw   in   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  in Total Defence.  Every in-camp training  that\r\n\r\nour  NSmen  go  to and every civil defence exercise  that  we\r\n\r\nparticipate in, is an investment in our own future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our success over the past 35 years would not have\r\n\r\nbeen possible without a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndefence  capability.  We have developed a  thriving  economy,\r\n\r\nour  own  distinct values and way of life, and above all,  we\r\n\r\nhave built and can be proud that we have a nation of our own.\r\n\r\nIf  we want to be able to carry on enjoying the fruits of our\r\n\r\nown  work  and  the  hard work of the Singaporeans  who  came\r\n\r\nbefore  us,  we  must continue to ensure  that  we  have  the\r\n\r\ndefence  capability  to  protect us and  to  provide  a  firm\r\n\r\nfoundation for Singapore's future development.  Only then can\r\n\r\nwe  secure more good years of peace and stability and achieve\r\n\r\nour dreams and aspirations for ourselves and our children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have dealt with some of the issues which have\r\n\r\nbeen  raised  by Members of Parliament who have  spoken.   My\r\n\r\ncolleagues in the Defence Ministry will deal with  the  other\r\n\r\nissues which they have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I want to thank the DPM for his\r\n\r\ncomprehensive overview of the defence policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Auditor-General, in his report for the\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  1998/99, has  highlighted the irregularities\r\n\r\nand  non-compliance with the Government financial  procedures\r\n\r\nin  the Ministry of Defence.  The Auditor-General noted  that\r\n\r\nfive  full-time  National Servicemen  were  seconded  to  DSO\r\n\r\nNational  Laboratories, a privatised unit, in 1997 for  about\r\n\r\none  to two years and another 14 National Servicemen were  on\r\n\r\nloan  to ST Automotive Ltd, a private company, in 1998.   The\r\n\r\nAuditor-General deemed that there were irregularities in such\r\n\r\na scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audit revealed that in February 1998, full payment of\r\n\r\n$976,000  was made to a supplier for goods that had not  been\r\n\r\nreceived by Mindef.  The Auditor-General classified this as a\r\n\r\n\"false declaration\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor-General also reported irregularities in\r\n\r\ncontracts  awarded  to  DSO  National  Laboratories.   Mindef\r\n\r\nofficers  who  also  served  as the  company  directors  were\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  decisions leading to the award of contracts  to\r\n\r\nthe  company.   Security  deposits  were  not  collected  and\r\n\r\nbanker's guarantee for advance payments of about $30  million\r\n\r\nwas waived without\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproper  approval.  Audit also highlighted that a bank account\r\n\r\nfor  fixed  deposits  of  $180  million  was  opened  without\r\n\r\napproval  of  the Accountant-General, as required  under  the\r\n\r\nfinancial procedures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Auditor-General noted that there was repeated\r\n\r\nfailure  to  refund  security deposits  no  longer  required,\r\n\r\namounting to $196,000.  On the other hand, there was delay in\r\n\r\nclearing and collecting long outstanding personal advances to\r\n\r\nofficers  for  official expenses, in some cases,  up  to  six\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not the first time that such weaknesses are\r\n\r\nbrought  to  the  attention of the  public  by  the  Auditor-General.    It would not do Mindef's reputation any  good  if\r\n\r\nthis  continues.   I,  therefore, urge Mindef  to  act,  take\r\n\r\nremedial  actions, exercise tighter supervision and undertake\r\n\r\npreventive  measures so that such incidents would  not  recur\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, our military is held in very high\r\n\r\nregard  and Mindef has earned its reputation as an efficient,\r\n\r\ncredible, disciplined and honest organisation.  Therefore, it\r\n\r\nwas  with  much  concern that I read in the Auditor-General's\r\n\r\nreport for FY 1998-1999 where it was highlighted that certain\r\n\r\nfinancial  procedures  were not  adhered  to  and  that  some\r\n\r\nfinancial irregularities had taken place in Mindef.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef enjoys tremendous bipartisan support both within\r\n\r\nthe House and among the ordinary people.  Naturally, when the\r\n\r\nAG's  report came out, there were eyebrows raised  among  the\r\n\r\npublic.  The matter is compounded by the fact that Mindef has\r\n\r\nto operate in a cloak of secrecy.  Parliament assents to this\r\n\r\ncloak  of secrecy by asking for few details on the budget  of\r\n\r\nMindef which amounts to $7.4 billion this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant of this cloak of secrecy by Parliament in turn\r\n\r\nrequires  an  even  higher  standard  of  responsibility  and\r\n\r\naccountability  for  public  money  when  compared  to  other\r\n\r\nMinistries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that the Auditor-General's report was brief\r\n\r\non  Mindef's  reply.  I would like to ask  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfirstly,  as  to  whether  the  Auditor-General's  report  is\r\n\r\naccurate  on the matters raised; secondly, whether there  was\r\n\r\nany loss of money to the Government on the matters raised  in\r\n\r\nthe report, and lastly, what measures will be taken to ensure\r\n\r\nthat such lapses do not recur in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, like my colleagues before me, I\r\n\r\ndo have some concerns on the matters expressed in the Auditor-General's  report.   I would like to add my  comment  on  the\r\n\r\nfalse declaration.  I perhaps understand that the idea was to\r\n\r\nmake  it easier to facilitate payment to the contractor.   In\r\n\r\nthis   case,  it  was  fortunate  that  the  certificate   of\r\n\r\ncompletion was given not because of any attempt to cheat  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  but to help the contractor with the  payment  of\r\n\r\nthe goods.  Although malice was not intended, it nevertheless\r\n\r\nshows  up  a weakness in the system.  Rather than counselling\r\n\r\nthe  parties  involved,  I would like  to  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  further  improvements  can  be  made  to  the  whole\r\n\r\nprocess.   Perhaps, a system of double signatures be  put  in\r\n\r\nplace  or  an  alternative  scheme  to  ensure  that  similar\r\n\r\nbreaches will not take place in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second concern raised by the Auditor-General, it\r\n\r\nwas  noted  that  contracts  were  made  with  Mindef-related\r\n\r\ncompanies  resulting in numerous instances of  non-compliance\r\n\r\nwith  the Government procurement procedures.  It appears that\r\n\r\nMindef officers who were appointed as company directors, were\r\n\r\ninvolved  in decisions leading to award of contracts  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the instance cited by the Auditor-General is an\r\n\r\nindication  of  how  defence  contract  between  two  related\r\n\r\nparties  in  a cosy relationship can lead to an oversight  of\r\n\r\nGovernment procurement procedures.  I would urge the Minister\r\n\r\nto  be  on  a vigilant safeguard to ensure that such breaches\r\n\r\nare not repeated again in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also note that in the case of transfer of funds, some\r\n\r\nmonies  were transferred to a bank account which  was  opened\r\n\r\nwithout the approval of the Accountant-General as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  required  by law and standing instructions.  The  Auditor\r\n\r\ncommented  that this was a serious break-down in controls  as\r\n\r\nthe  funds  in  the  bank could have been  siphoned  off  for\r\n\r\nunauthorised use. Would the Minister kindly explain how these\r\n\r\naccounts came to be opened and whether steps have been  taken\r\n\r\nto  prevent  a  repeat of such breaches.  Like  my  colleague\r\n\r\nbefore  me,  I would like to emphasise that Mindef  enjoys  a\r\n\r\nhigh  level  of confidence among the members of  the  public.\r\n\r\nThese   instances  cited  by  the  Auditor-General  must   be\r\n\r\naddressed  by the Government if the confidence of the  public\r\n\r\nis to be maintained for the future.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  because I am a bit uncomfortable about the  brevity  of\r\n\r\ninformation  contained  in  the Budget  statement  under  the\r\n\r\nDefence Ministry as it does not give me a good idea of how we\r\n\r\nare  allocating resources to meet our defence objectives  and\r\n\r\npriorities   and  I  would  ask  the  Minister  for   greater\r\n\r\ndisclosure of information in the Budget statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that there is a need to maintain\r\n\r\nconfidentiality on national security matters but  would  like\r\n\r\nto  attempt  to persuade the Minister to give  this  House  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  more information on the various expenditures  so\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans know how much we are paying  to  keep  the\r\n\r\npeace   and  stability  in  Singapore  through  the   various\r\n\r\nprogrammes and strategies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans understand the need to maintain a very\r\n\r\nstrong  total defence capability and that we need to maintain\r\n\r\na  consistently high level of investment so that the SAF  can\r\n\r\nremain  to be a strong defence force.  Therefore, we need  to\r\n\r\ntake  a  very  long-term  view that even  during  periods  of\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis,  we have maintained a very  high  level  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure so that our long-term goals are not compromised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans also accept the fact that due to our\r\n\r\nlimited resources, it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnecessary for us to conduct training overseas, which  is  not\r\n\r\nonly a complex matter, but a very expensive matter.  As local\r\n\r\ntraining  becomes  more  scarce, more sophisticated  training\r\n\r\nfacilities  will  need  to  be  built  to  provide   training\r\n\r\nconditions  which are as realistic as possible.  It  will  be\r\n\r\ngood,  and  Singaporeans should know how much it  would  cost\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans also understand that as part of our defence\r\n\r\npolicy,  we  need to strengthen dialogue, confidence-building\r\n\r\nand  cooperation in the region through military relations and\r\n\r\ncommitments through multi-lateral defence agreements. We have\r\n\r\nwitnessed  how  important these military relations  are.  For\r\n\r\nexample, the personal relationships between SAF officers  and\r\n\r\nTNI officers have been significant in maintaining ties during\r\n\r\nthe difficult Habibie administration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we continue to maintain relations at all levels\r\n\r\nbetween  SAF and other armies in the region, can I  interpret\r\n\r\nfrom  the  budget that the financial resources available  for\r\n\r\nthese  programmes  are  available entirely  from  the  public\r\n\r\nrelations  budget?   How much are we doing  and  spending  to\r\n\r\ndevelop better military relations with our neighbours?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans also recognise that we need to make in-camp training more convenient and as least disruptive as\r\n\r\npossible  as people find it increasingly difficult to  juggle\r\n\r\nbetween  their  work and their responsibilities  towards  the\r\n\r\nSAF.  This is a small price we have to pay, but certainly  we\r\n\r\nneed to know how much it would cost us. I am aware of the on-going  innovation,  process  improvement  of  procedures  and\r\n\r\npractices  to  make training more relevant and realistic.  As\r\n\r\nthis would become increasingly important, perhaps we need  to\r\n\r\nask  whether  we  can do more, or whether  there  are  enough\r\n\r\nresources  allocated towards this objective.  Making  in-camp\r\n\r\ntraining  more  relevant and meaningful is certainly  an  on-going   commitment.    As  Singaporeans,  we  need   to   ask\r\n\r\nourselves:  are we prepared and how much are we  prepared  to\r\n\r\npay  for  this? Singaporeans can also be proud to be able  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to international peace,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  example,  to  be part of the United  Nations  effort  in\r\n\r\ndispute  and conflict prevention worldwide, and in  terms  of\r\n\r\ndonation, assistance of equipment and personnel.  How much of\r\n\r\nour defence budget is allocated for this purpose?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of community relations, we realise the\r\n\r\nsignificance  of maintaining good communication  and  support\r\n\r\nwith the public. In this regard, I am specifically asking the\r\n\r\nMinister  to consider setting up another RECORD Committee  to\r\n\r\nrecognise the contribution of NS men, in view of the changing\r\n\r\neconomic profile of the NS men.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said that on matters of developing strategic\r\n\r\ncomponents   of  the  SAF,  building  strong  and  indigenous\r\n\r\ntechnologies  and purchase of military hardware,  it  may  be\r\n\r\nbest kept confidential in view of its implication on national\r\n\r\nsecurity.  But on all other matters that I have mentioned,  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister will not hesitate to inform this House  how\r\n\r\nmuch  has been spent on the various programmes to keep  peace\r\n\r\nin  this  country.  I think transparency,  and  a  more  open\r\n\r\ndisclosure  of information on the one hand and, the  need  to\r\n\r\nbalance and maintain confidentiality and secrecy on the other\r\n\r\nhand, can be achieved and possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, under this cut, I had originally\r\n\r\nintended to speak on new security challenges for the SAF.   I\r\n\r\nnote  in  the  Minister's reply that the SAF is committed  to\r\n\r\nmeeting  the new security challenges and I am much  comforted\r\n\r\nby  the  assurance given by the Minister.  I shall  therefore\r\n\r\nnot  be  making any further speech in this area.  Can I  have\r\n\r\nyour permission to take the next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, in the recent debate on the\r\n\r\nDefence  Science and Technology Agency Bill, my parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleague  raised the question of the Agency's accountability\r\n\r\nto  Parliament. In the debate, it was noted that under clause\r\n\r\n19  of  the  Bill,  the  Minister dispenses  money  given  by\r\n\r\nParliament  to DSTA although Parliament provides  the  money.\r\n\r\nThe Bill only requires that the annual report be given to the\r\n\r\nMinister for Defence\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  he  in  turn will give the report to a Committee  to  be\r\n\r\nappointed by the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not appear that the money appropriated by DSTA\r\n\r\nis  a  matter  that  is  subject to public  scrutiny  through\r\n\r\nParliament.   Some  concern was raised as  to  the  issue  of\r\n\r\naccountability on the use of funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the work of DSTA has to be\r\n\r\nshrouded  to some extent by secrecy as by its defence-related\r\n\r\nwork,  and by its very nature, it has to be secret.  DPM  has\r\n\r\nin his reply confirmed this.  I agree that the fact that DSTA\r\n\r\nis  now a statutory board does not remove any requirement  of\r\n\r\nsecrecy  and  the same has to be maintained for many  of  the\r\n\r\ndetailed activities of the DSTA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can well appreciate the argument why matters of\r\n\r\nfinancial  provisions of DSTA should  not  be  a  subject  of\r\n\r\npublic debate. However, I would like to mention that there is\r\n\r\na distinction to be made between public accountability on the\r\n\r\none hand, and private accountability to a group of people who\r\n\r\ncommands  the  trust  and confidence of the  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  to  play  their part in ensuring  that  the  relevant\r\n\r\nagency is doing their work properly.  In this debate, we  are\r\n\r\nnot  saying that the Agency should subject its agenda or  its\r\n\r\nprogramme   to   public  scrutiny.   What   I   believe   our\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleagues are asking for is that  a  mechanism\r\n\r\nbe  set out which comprises independent parties who can  help\r\n\r\nensure that the funds appropriated by the agency are properly\r\n\r\nspent. Indeed, it did not help to inspire much confidence  in\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public  when  the  Bill  allowed  for   the\r\n\r\nappointment of an auditor and not the Auditor-General, who is\r\n\r\nan independent official of the State.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there are fixed financial procedures that\r\n\r\nare   in  place  to  ensure  that  the  integrity  of  public\r\n\r\nadministration is not compromised. However, I am  sure,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  you  will agree with me that unless we institutionalise\r\n\r\nchecks  on our systems, lapses may occur. We note the  recent\r\n\r\nreport of the Auditor-General of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnumerous   instances   of  non-compliance   with   Government\r\n\r\nprocurement  procedures.  This happened in a situation  where\r\n\r\nwe  have  two  contracting parties  who  are  in  very  close\r\n\r\nrelationship to one another.  Without an independent body  to\r\n\r\nwatch  over  the  work of the DSTA, we cannot  be  sure  that\r\n\r\nlapses in financial procedures may not occur in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in the light of our concern that I would urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to consider appointing the Auditor-General  and\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public, including MPs, who are  seen  to  be\r\n\r\nindependent  bodies,  to  sit on the relevant  committees  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  funds which are dispensed by the  Minister  and\r\n\r\nwhich are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny, are properly\r\n\r\nutilised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I understand Mr Ravindran is\r\n\r\nnot taking this cut.

And every year, the\r\n\r\nSAF  has  to make do and make the best use of the  cohort  of\r\n\r\nmale  citizens enlisting for full-time National Service.   It\r\n\r\nemphasizes   higher productivity and reliance on  technology,\r\n\r\nand at the same time outsourcing non-essential functions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to note that Mindef will adhere to the\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  two  and  a  half years  of  full-time  National\r\n\r\nService, and will not seek further extension of the period of\r\n\r\nservice.  I would like to ask, with the changing roles of the\r\n\r\nSAF,  whether  the SAF can cope with the increasing  manpower\r\n\r\nrequirements.   With  the recovery of the  economy,  are  the\r\n\r\nvarious  manpower  schemes sufficiently  attractive  for  the\r\n\r\nrecruitment of regular officers and men?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, at the same time, that it is the declared aim\r\n\r\nof  the  SAF  to  renew itself and keep  the  SAF  young  and\r\n\r\nfighting-fit.

It is\r\n\r\nalso  about  ethos, people management, the art of  leadership\r\n\r\nand  staff  welfare.  It is this common bond and team  spirit\r\n\r\nthat hold a fighting unit together in times of crisis and  in\r\n\r\nthe  line  of  fire.

Lim):</b> Sir, I would like first to take the cuts on the Auditor-General and financial procedures in Mindef.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Ravindran\r\n\r\nand  Mr Sin Boon Ann for raising their concerns regarding the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General's  report on Mindef and this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nclarify the issues raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef takes the Auditor-General's report very\r\n\r\nseriously.   Firstly, I would like to emphasise that  in  all\r\n\r\nthe breaches raised by the Auditor-General, there was no loss\r\n\r\nof funds due to the misuse of public funds or fraud.  All the\r\n\r\nbreaches have been rectified and all monies were at all times\r\n\r\naccounted  for.   Most of the breaches  were  the  result  of\r\n\r\nadministrative  lapses.  Mindef  appreciates   the   Auditor-General's  observations and help in discovering these  lapses\r\n\r\nand measures have been taken to ensure that the same problems\r\n\r\nwill not recur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in some instances, Mindef felt that the\r\n\r\nbreaches did not have the severe consequential effects  noted\r\n\r\nin  the  Auditor-General's report.  Sir, I would now like  to\r\n\r\ntake some time to give a more detailed explanation of the key\r\n\r\nissues raised by the Auditor-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, bank account for deposits of $180 million\r\n\r\nopened  without approval. The Auditor-General's  report  said\r\n\r\nthat the bank account for three fixed deposits,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntotalling  $180 million, was opened without the  approval  of\r\n\r\nthe  Accountant-General.  It is said that this is  a  serious\r\n\r\nbreakdown  in control as funds in the bank could be  siphoned\r\n\r\noff  for unauthorised use. This is a fairly complicated case.\r\n\r\nAllow  me to briefly explain the transactions and assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse that the funds were, at all times, fully accounted  for\r\n\r\nand could not have been siphoned out of Mindef's accounts for\r\n\r\nunauthorised purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funds in question were part of a SAVER fund. The\r\n\r\nSAVER fund board had decided that the SAVER funds were to  be\r\n\r\ninvested  in bonds, equities and cash instruments.   Separate\r\n\r\naccounts  would  be opened for each category of  instruments.\r\n\r\nAt  the  material  time, accounts had been  opened  with  the\r\n\r\napproval  of  the  Accountant-General  for  bonds  and   cash\r\n\r\ninstruments.   The funds in question were earmarked  for  the\r\n\r\ncash  account  for investment in cash instruments,  that  is,\r\n\r\nthis  $180  million.  They were placed instead  in  the  bond\r\n\r\naccount.   However, they were not invested in  bonds  because\r\n\r\nthe  bonds  manager at that time had not yet been  appointed.\r\n\r\nInstead, they were invested in fixed deposits, that is, in  a\r\n\r\ncash  instrument for two months.  The officers in charge  had\r\n\r\ndone   this  because,  at  that  particular  time,  the  bank\r\n\r\noperating  the  bond account was able to offer  a  much  more\r\n\r\nattractive interest rate for fixed deposits compared  to  the\r\n\r\nfixed deposit rates offered by other banks.  The higher  rate\r\n\r\nearned Mindef more than $400,000, in additional interest over\r\n\r\nthe two months.  But the placement of funds earmarked for the\r\n\r\ncash  account  into the bond account was wrong. The  officers\r\n\r\nwho   authorised   this   transfer  have,   therefore,   been\r\n\r\nreprimanded for this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mindef would like to point out that the\r\n\r\nofficers  were  able  to transfer the  funds  into  the  bond\r\n\r\naccount,  instead  of  the  cash account  only  because  both\r\n\r\naccounts  were  properly  set up with  the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nAccountant-General. These accounts are subject to  the  usual\r\n\r\nfinancial  controls adopted by the Government. The  funds  in\r\n\r\nquestion were, therefore, at all times, accounted for  within\r\n\r\nMindef and could not have been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsiphoned off to any unauthorised account outside of Mindef.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, irregularities and contracts awarded to DSO\r\n\r\nNational  Laboratories. The Auditor-General reported  certain\r\n\r\nirregularities  in  contracts that Mindef have  entered  into\r\n\r\nwith  a  related company, DSO National Laboratories  (DSONL).\r\n\r\nFor  example, it said that one contract was signed before the\r\n\r\ncompany  was  incorporated, and that Mindef  officers  signed\r\n\r\nseveral  contracts on behalf of the company.   It  also  said\r\n\r\nthat  Mindef  officers, who were appointed as  the  company's\r\n\r\ndirectors,  were also involved in decisions  leading  to  the\r\n\r\naward  of  the  contracts to the company.  These observations\r\n\r\nimply  that  because  Mindef officers were  acting  for  both\r\n\r\nparties  to  the  contracts, the dealings were  not  at  arms\r\n\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these irregularities occurred during the\r\n\r\ntransitional period when the Defence Science Organisation was\r\n\r\nconverted from a Government department to a corporate entity.\r\n\r\nThe  formation  of a corporate entity meant  that  extant  or\r\n\r\nexisting  projects  in the department  had  to  be  converted\r\n\r\novernight  into  formal  contracts  between  Mindef  and  the\r\n\r\ncompany  to  ensure  the  continuity  of  projects.    Mindef\r\n\r\nofficers were involved on both sides of the contracts because\r\n\r\nDSONL  was set up specifically to serve Mindef and  the  SAF,\r\n\r\nand  Mindef  officers were therefore appointed  to  hold  key\r\n\r\npositions  in the company.  There was no collusion  to  award\r\n\r\ncontracts  unfairly to the company, nor to bypass  tender  or\r\n\r\nother procurement procedures as these contracts were made  to\r\n\r\nregularise  work that was already being done by DSONL  before\r\n\r\nits  corporatisation.  I can therefore assure Mr Sin Boon Ann\r\n\r\nthat this was not due to any cosy relationship between Mindef\r\n\r\nand DSONL.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Auditor-General's Report said that Mindef had\r\n\r\nmade  a full payment of $976,000 to a supplier for goods that\r\n\r\nhad not been received by Mindef.  This matter\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconcerned  the purchase of computer equipment.   The  project\r\n\r\nengineer  had  issued  a  post-dated  acceptance  certificate\r\n\r\nbefore  he physically accepted the goods.  The report pointed\r\n\r\nout that this was a false declaration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of a post-dated acceptance certificate\r\n\r\nwas  a  wrong action on the part of the officer.  It was  not\r\n\r\ndone  so  much  to help the contractor, but it was  done  for\r\n\r\nreasons that only the project officer would know.  Perhaps it\r\n\r\nwas to expedite payment towards the end of a financial year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mindef has investigated this matter, and found\r\n\r\nthat  all  the goods under this contract have been  delivered\r\n\r\nand  certified  to be in good order and condition.   We  also\r\n\r\nnoted  that  payment was made only after the goods  had  been\r\n\r\nphysically inspected, certified and accepted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef has issued instructions prohibiting post-dating\r\n\r\nof the certificate of acceptance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor-General also observed that the computation\r\n\r\nof  employer  and employee CPF contributions  was  incorrect.\r\n\r\nThis  was  due to the different rounding-off method  used  by\r\n\r\nMindef   because  of  a  different  interpretation   of   the\r\n\r\nguidelines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Auditor General's input, Mindef has since\r\n\r\namended  the  computerised payroll  programme  to  apply  the\r\n\r\nrounding-off method adopted by the Central Pay  Office.   The\r\n\r\nearlier rounding-off method adopted by Mindef had resulted in\r\n\r\nan  overall net over-contribution of CPF by Mindef  of  about\r\n\r\n$613,000 over a period of five years, from 1993 to July 1998.\r\n\r\nEssentially,   for   some  servicemen,   there   were   over-contributions of about $1 to $2 per serviceman per month.  As\r\n\r\nit   was   not  cost-effective  to  recover  the  net   over-contribution,  Mindef has requested the Ministry  of  Finance\r\n\r\nfor permission to write off this amount.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor-General felt that it was irregular for\r\n\r\nMindef  to  second  19 full-time national servicemen  to  two\r\n\r\ncompanies that were not gazetted as designated\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\norganisations for national service under the Enlistment Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef referred this matter to the Attorney-General for\r\n\r\nadvice.    The  Attorney-General  has  confirmed   that   the\r\n\r\nsecondment  and  loan  of  the  servicemen  to  the  external\r\n\r\nagencies  were  lawful.   However, Mindef  has  returned  all\r\n\r\npayments received for the deployment of the servicemen to the\r\n\r\ntwo organisations since the servicemen were in the employment\r\n\r\nof SAF at the material time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Auditor General also reported on several\r\n\r\ninstances of non-recovery of various types of monies, and the\r\n\r\nfailure  of  Mindef to refund deposits and clear  other  long\r\n\r\noutstanding  accounts.  Mindef has replied  to  the  Auditor-General on these matters.  If Members are interested, I  will\r\n\r\ngive   them   a  full  account  upon  request.   Mindef   has\r\n\r\ninvestigated these cases and rectified the matters raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Ong and Mr Ravindran have also asked what\r\n\r\nmeasures Mindef has taken to ensure that such lapses  do  not\r\n\r\nrecur  in  future.  Mindef has implemented various programmes\r\n\r\nto enhance the financial and procurement management in Mindef\r\n\r\nand the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of education and training, Mindef has\r\n\r\nlaunched  new  communication channels to quickly  disseminate\r\n\r\nlessons learnt and best practices to the relevant Mindef  and\r\n\r\nSAF   personnel.   In  addition,  all  audit   findings   are\r\n\r\ncirculated  to the various commanders so that they  can  take\r\n\r\nsteps to prevent similar problems occurring in their units.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef is also stepping up training on financial and\r\n\r\nprocurement procedures.  For finance appointment holders, our\r\n\r\naim  is  for such officers to pass a proficiency test  before\r\n\r\nthey  are  allowed  to  perform  their  duties.   When  fully\r\n\r\nimplemented, this system would ensure that only  trained  and\r\n\r\ncertified   competent  personnel  are  appointed  to   handle\r\n\r\nfinancial matters and payments can only be made if the claims\r\n\r\nare handled by certified personnel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of accountability, procurement agencies are\r\n\r\nnow providing annual declarations that they have observed and\r\n\r\ncomplied\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  all  procurement policies and procedures.  This  is  in\r\n\r\nline with the Ministry of Finance's requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to reiterate that\r\n\r\nthere  are  strong and sound systems of control in  place  in\r\n\r\nMindef.   As  a large organisation, occasional administrative\r\n\r\nlapses may happen from time to time.  Nonetheless,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMindef  is  committed to complying with Government procedures\r\n\r\nin  procurement  and financial management.   We  continue  to\r\n\r\nsimplify  and clarify our internal guidelines,  and  to  take\r\n\r\nvarious measures to further strengthen our systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mindef is mindful that it has a big responsibility\r\n\r\nto ensure that defence funds are fully accounted for and well\r\n\r\nspent  to  build up a strong SAF and defence  capability.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to thank Members for their continued support,  and\r\n\r\nassure  them  that Mindef will continue to  be  vigilant  and\r\n\r\nprudent in its financial and procurement activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move on to the cut by Mr Zulkifli on defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure and also by Mr Sin Boon Ann on accountability and\r\n\r\nsecrecy  in the SAF.  Both these Members have expressed  that\r\n\r\nthey  would  like to see greater disclosure on  the  part  of\r\n\r\nMindef.   Mr Zulkifli has suggested that without compromising\r\n\r\nsecrecy, we should have more disclosure on things such as the\r\n\r\ncost  to  send  troops overseas for training or  for  in-camp\r\n\r\ntraining  or  to  maintain good military  relationships  with\r\n\r\nother armed forces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by its very nature - and the Members have noted\r\n\r\nthis   -  matters of defence and security must be kept within\r\n\r\nthe   realm  of  secrecy,  and  cannot  be  subject  to  open\r\n\r\ndiscussion  in  public.   Public disclosures  of  details  of\r\n\r\nMindef's procurement and the SAF's operations will compromise\r\n\r\nsecurity.   It will be prejudicial to the national  interest.\r\n\r\nFor  this  reason,  Mindef has always  kept  details  of  its\r\n\r\nfinances secret.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef has also never published details of its defence\r\n\r\nprocurements.  This practice, which is also the case in  many\r\n\r\nother   countries,  will  therefore  continue.   Nonetheless,\r\n\r\nMindef  is  very  conscious  of the  need  to  maintain  high\r\n\r\nstandards of prudence and accountability.  And as I have just\r\n\r\nmentioned,  measures exist to ensure that the defence  budget\r\n\r\nvoted by Parliament to Mindef is well used, and that the  SAF\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  be  an  effective force  able  to  defend  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within Mindef, there are comprehensive processes and\r\n\r\ncontrols  to ensure that every defence dollar is well  spent.\r\n\r\nThere  are  also  internal checks provided both  by  Mindef's\r\n\r\ninternal  audit  department and this is in  addition  to  the\r\n\r\nexternal  checks  by  the Auditor-General.   Ultimately,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister and Cabinet being responsible for Singapore's\r\n\r\ndefence  and  security  will ensure  that  defence  money  is\r\n\r\nchannelled  to  the  right projects and procurements.   These\r\n\r\nvarious  checks  are a safeguard to ensure that  the  defence\r\n\r\nbudget   is   used  prudently  and  responsibly.   Sufficient\r\n\r\nsafeguards therefore exist to provide a check and balance for\r\n\r\ndefence  spending.  The public can rest assured  that  Mindef\r\n\r\nand  the  SAF  will  continue to maintain high  standards  of\r\n\r\naccountability in its operations and processes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sin Boon Ann raised a matter of the annual\r\n\r\nreport  and  suggested  that  certain  external  members   be\r\n\r\nappointed  to look through this report.  The Defence  Science\r\n\r\nand  Technology  Agency Act already provides  for  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  to  appoint a Committee to receive and  to  examine\r\n\r\nthis  report,  and  I  think we can leave  it  to  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  to  ensure  that  persons  of  integrity  will   be\r\n\r\nappointed to this role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin also suggested that the Auditor-General should be\r\n\r\nappointed to audit the Defence Science and Technology  Agency\r\n\r\nrather  than  an auditor to be appointed by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nDefence.  I think the issue is not so much whether it is  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General  who  audits  or  whether  it  is  any  other\r\n\r\nauditor, but that again this task is done conscientiously  by\r\n\r\nmen  and  women  who  are independent  and  take  their  jobs\r\n\r\nseriously.  I can assure Mr Sin that the people who  will  be\r\n\r\nappointed to this task will be such people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was another cut by Dr Ong Chit Chung about\r\n\r\nmanpower  in  the  SAF.   As  my Deputy  Prime  Minister  and\r\n\r\nMinister for Defence has already noted, wars are not  won  by\r\n\r\ntechnology  or  by machines but by people.  Manpower  is  our\r\n\r\nmost  important asset and Mindef spares no effort  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat we are able to recruit and retain sufficient numbers  of\r\n\r\ngood  people  for  the  SAF.  As the  Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nmentioned,  the  new partnership schemes that were  announced\r\n\r\nrecently  for  military  officers and  warrant  officers  are\r\n\r\nexamples  of some of the measures that we have undertaken  to\r\n\r\nensure that the SAF is able to compete effectively in the job\r\n\r\nmarket for limited manpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, we have in place many schemes to\r\n\r\nattract  talented people to join the SAF.   For  example,  we\r\n\r\noffer  scholarships.  And at the apex of SAF is the  Overseas\r\n\r\nScholarships  Scheme to attract some of the brightest  school\r\n\r\nleavers to join the SAF.  The Overseas Scholarship Scheme  is\r\n\r\nsecond only in prestige to the President's scholarships,  and\r\n\r\nit  is instrumental in ensuring that each year we have a fair\r\n\r\nshare  of  the  national talent pool.  Besides  the  overseas\r\n\r\nscholarships, we have arranged for other local  and  overseas\r\n\r\nawards  also  to attract bright students to take up  military\r\n\r\ncareers.   So,  Dr Ong can be assured that upon  joining  the\r\n\r\nSAF, military personnel can look forward to a challenging and\r\n\r\nrewarding career.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also mentioned his concern that there may not be\r\n\r\nenough time for commanders to spend time in specific commands\r\n\r\nbecause  the  routes  of advancement and  their  careers  are\r\n\r\nrather  short.  I would like to assure Dr Ong and Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  that this is an area that Mindef pays particular\r\n\r\nattention  to,  and  routes  of  advancements  are  carefully\r\n\r\ndesigned to ensure that commanders have sufficient command as\r\n\r\nwell  as staff responsibility before they move on to a higher\r\n\r\nlevel of command.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  for  his comments on my request whether  he  would\r\n\r\nconsider  setting  up  a RECORD committee  to  recognise  the\r\n\r\ncontributions of national servicemen?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> I am sorry I missed that question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last time we had a RECORD committee was some\r\n\r\nfour  or  five  years ago.

Idling  time\r\n\r\nshould  be  minimized.  Those who have been through  NS  know\r\n\r\noften  times the NSmen have to wait a long, long time at  the\r\n\r\nrange  for  their  turn to shoot.  It was a very  long  wait.\r\n\r\nCan  we not revamp the system and cut down idling time at the\r\n\r\nranges, for example?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what further progress SAF has\r\n\r\nmade in optimising the use of land as well as manpower?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will go to my next cut. Some three years ago, we\r\n\r\nhad  a  number  of unfortunate casualties in the  SAF  during\r\n\r\ntraining and exercises.  The whole SAF was geared up to  give\r\n\r\nthe highest priority to safety measures in training.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister for an update of the safety\r\n\r\nmeasures  implemented, and whether such  measures  are  being\r\n\r\nfollowed religiously by all units.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I support what has been raised by\r\n\r\nDr   Ong Chit Chung and I appreciate that SAF training has to\r\n\r\nbe  realistic  enough  to prepare our servicemen  for  actual\r\n\r\ncombat  situations.   I  understand that  the  SAF  has  very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive safety measures already established.   However,\r\n\r\ncould the Minister tell us what additional measures have been\r\n\r\ninitiated  to  enhance  safety  in  training,  especially  at\r\n\r\nunfamiliar overseas training areas and whether these measures\r\n\r\nare indeed effective?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, ultimately, defence is\r\n\r\neverybody's   business,  not  just  that  of   the   National\r\n\r\nServicemen.    It   is  the  business  of  each   and   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean.   It  is  the total defence.   It  requires  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  family:  the father,  the  mother  and  the\r\n\r\nsiblings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Service is now accepted as part and parcel of\r\n\r\nlife,  part  of  the  Singaporean's way  of  life.   National\r\n\r\nService  is so institutionalised and ingrained, that  it  has\r\n\r\nbecome  a  people's movement for the defence of the homeland.\r\n\r\nI  call  it  \"homeland\", because we are defending our  homes,\r\n\r\nevery home and every inch of our land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, at the meet-the-people sessions, we see more\r\n\r\nand  more cases of petitioners appealing for upgrading rather\r\n\r\nthan downgrading of medical classifications in NS.  Our young\r\n\r\nmen  would  rather be in the combat vocations.  They  compete\r\n\r\nfiercely  for a place in the Officer Cadet School.   This  is\r\n\r\nindeed  a  good sign.  There is no doubt that young  National\r\n\r\nServicemen are now better prepared and enlist with the  right\r\n\r\nattitude  and  aptitude.  This, no doubt, is  helped  by  the\r\n\r\nimprovement in the facilities and services in the  SAF.   The\r\n\r\nfood, for example, has improved tremendously.  Some even told\r\n\r\ntheir  mothers that the food in camps is better than that  of\r\n\r\nmum's  cooking!  I am sure mum does not mind a little bit  of\r\n\r\ncompetition.  My son told his mother that.  The point here is\r\n\r\nthat if all appreciate the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimportance  of  defence and National Service, then  we  would\r\n\r\nhave  achieved the aim of Total Defence and the  strategy  of\r\n\r\ndeterrence.  As Sun Tzu, the strategist, said, we  would  win\r\n\r\nthe  war without fighting.  The enemy would not dare to  make\r\n\r\nthe first move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister if Mindef will further enhance\r\n\r\nthe  national  education programmes  in  the  SAF,  and  work\r\n\r\nclosely too with the Ministry of Education and the schools to\r\n\r\nfurther promote the concept and practice of total defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ravindran, you could take your three\r\n\r\ncuts together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, total defence highlights the critical\r\n\r\nrole everyone has to play in the defence of our country.   It\r\n\r\nis  important that our citizens be constantly reminded to  be\r\n\r\never  vigilant  and  prepared for  a  sudden  change  in  the\r\n\r\nsecurity situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was happy and impressed with the recent spate of\r\n\r\nadvertisements that were shown on television.  It was a  wake\r\n\r\nup  call  to  Singaporeans who are complacent about  national\r\n\r\ndefence.   The  advertisements were direct and hit  home  the\r\n\r\nmessage  clearly.   I must compliment Mindef  for  that  bold\r\n\r\ninitiative  in strengthening Psychological Defence  which  is\r\n\r\none of the five key elements in Total Defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, increasingly, more and more foreigners are taking\r\n\r\nup  PR and citizenship here.  Many of them do not undergo the\r\n\r\ngrowing up and shared experience of a Singaporean.  They have\r\n\r\nnot  studied  here nor done NS. I see a challenge  in  making\r\n\r\nthis  group  of new Singaporeans committed to the defence  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister in what other ways\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry intends to further inculcate the importance  of\r\n\r\nTotal  Defence  among  the people of Singapore,  particularly\r\n\r\namong  our  new  migrants.  I would  also  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister   whether  a  co-ordinating  committee   exists   to\r\n\r\ncoordinate  our efforts at Total Defence.  If  so,  the  work\r\n\r\ndone by such a committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the next topic on the SAF and East\r\n\r\nTimor.   I  must commend the SAF for the quiet but  essential\r\n\r\nrole  by the SAF in East Timor as part of the INTERFET  team.\r\n\r\nOur  LSTs, though old, played a critical role in the transfer\r\n\r\nof  much  needed logistics.  Our soldiers were also  said  to\r\n\r\nhave  conducted  themselves  in a professional  and  friendly\r\n\r\nmanner  with  all  the  other INTERFET participating  forces.\r\n\r\nThey have done the SAF and Singapore proud.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the United Nations Transition Administration for\r\n\r\nEast  Timor (UNTAET) is now in place in East Timor.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the Minister in what ways the SAF  is  helping\r\n\r\nUNTAET  and  the  people  of East  Timor  in  rebuilding  the\r\n\r\ncountry.   I  would  also like to ask  the  Minister  for  an\r\n\r\nassessment on whether there are any threats to the safety  of\r\n\r\nour men and the challenges faced by them in East Timor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will move on to the third topic, defence science\r\n\r\nand  technology research.  It has become a simple truth  that\r\n\r\nsuperior technology capability is a force multiplier in  war.\r\n\r\nJane's Defence Weekly in its 9th February edition highlighted\r\n\r\nthe  future  role of autonomous weapons, robotic warfare  and\r\n\r\nhow they will greatly impact military doctrine in future.  It\r\n\r\nis clear that superior technology is vital in winning wars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the setting up of the DSTA will provide the SAF\r\n\r\nwith  a  one  stop agency that will take care  of  the  SAF's\r\n\r\ndefence  science and technology research needs.  In  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  fast  changing pace of technology and equipment,  it  is\r\n\r\ncritical  that we do not rely on DSTA's inhouse  capabilities\r\n\r\nfor  all  our research needs. In fact, many overseas  defence\r\n\r\nscience and technology research organisations have gone  into\r\n\r\nboth  local and overseas joint collaboration  to conduct  R&D\r\n\r\nin  these fields.  I am glad that Mindef has also embarked on\r\n\r\nthis  path  recently.   It  will certainly  help  reduce  the\r\n\r\nlearning curve and minimise the time to bring a product  into\r\n\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the measures taken by Mindef to work\r\n\r\nclosely with the industry,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe    academic    institutions   and    overseas    research\r\n\r\nestablishments to ensure quality research and that  there  is\r\n\r\ntransfer  of knowledge from the private sector to Mindef  and\r\n\r\nvice   versa,   particularly  in  R&D  which   has   civilian\r\n\r\napplications?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Whether DSTA has plans to implement a scheme similar\r\n\r\nto  the  one  in  place  by the DEFA in  the  UK  called  the\r\n\r\n\"Pathfinder\" Programme which can allow industry  to  bid  for\r\n\r\nDSTA  funds  for novel defence research in areas  which  meet\r\n\r\nboth  the  companies and the DSTA's priorities and  represent\r\n\r\nideas which are superior to those coming up within DSTA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Whether DSTA would consider setting up dual use\r\n\r\ntechnology centres where new technologies being developed can\r\n\r\nbe used both by Mindef and for civilian use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Whether DSTA has plans to sell its research\r\n\r\nfacilities and services for civilian application directly  to\r\n\r\nthe industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Whether Mindef is going to set itself a minimum\r\n\r\npercentage  benchmark  figure  in  their  budget  for  annual\r\n\r\nresearch so as to ensure that research is never neglected  as\r\n\r\nwas found in some countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir, Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr Ravindran asked about the Five\r\n\r\nPower Defence Arrangements.  Since its establishment in 1971,\r\n\r\nthe  FPDA  has  been  an important element  of  the  security\r\n\r\narchitecture in our region. The underlying principle  of  the\r\n\r\nFPDA  is  that  the  defence  of Malaysia  and  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nindivisible.  Or as the then Malaysian Defence Minister  Dato\r\n\r\nAbang  Abu  Bakar  put it last year, \"Cubit paha  kiri,  paha\r\n\r\nkanan pun sakit,\" or \"If the left thigh is pinched, the right\r\n\r\nthigh  also  feels  the pain.\"  Hence the  indivisibility  of\r\n\r\ndefence.  FPDA members would immediately consult together  on\r\n\r\nwhat  measures  should be taken to deal  with  an  attack  or\r\n\r\naggression against Malaysia or Singapore. Any aggressor  will\r\n\r\ntherefore  have to take into account not only the  individual\r\n\r\nresponses  of Malaysia and Singapore, but also the collective\r\n\r\nresponse of these two countries plus\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAustralia, New Zealand and the UK. This is a deterrent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although FPDA exercises were suspended for a short\r\n\r\nperiod  between 1998 and 1999, the FPDA is now back on track.\r\n\r\nThe exercises and activities resumed last year. This year the\r\n\r\nFPDA  will conduct two major exercises. Exercise Flying  Fish\r\n\r\n2000  will  coincide  with  the 4th FPDA  Defence  Ministers'\r\n\r\nMeeting  in Singapore this July. FPDA members have also  been\r\n\r\nreviewing how the operational arrangements and exercises  can\r\n\r\nbe   enhanced  for  greater  professional  benefit  for   the\r\n\r\nparticipating forces and to ensure that the FPDA continues to\r\n\r\nbe relevant to the security of Singapore and Malaysia and the\r\n\r\nregion.   Sir,  Malaysia has assured the other  FPDA  members\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  fully  committed to  the  FPDA.   Since  the\r\n\r\nresumption  of  exercises last year, they  have  participated\r\n\r\nfully  in FPDA activities. Arrangements have also been worked\r\n\r\nout  to  facilitate smooth and expeditious search and  rescue\r\n\r\nshould that be necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr Charles Chong have asked about\r\n\r\npiracy  and  illegal immigrants.  The problem of  piracy  has\r\n\r\nbeen  discussed  within ASEAN and the  ASEAN  Regional  Forum\r\n\r\n(ARF).  ASEAN has agreed to intensify bilateral co-operation,\r\n\r\nwhile  the ARF will explore co-operative approaches  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a bilateral level, Singapore has a standing\r\n\r\narrangement with Indonesia called the Indonesia-Singapore Co-ordinated Patrols (ISCP) to help us deal with piracy  in  the\r\n\r\nseas  around Singapore. Our Navy and Police Coast  Guard  and\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian Navy and Police work together  on  this.  The\r\n\r\narrangement  allows an effective exchange of information  and\r\n\r\nfacilitates cross-border pursuit. This co-operation has  been\r\n\r\ngoing  on  smoothly  and effectively. The  incidence  of  sea\r\n\r\nrobbery   within  the  ISCP  area  of  operations  has   been\r\n\r\nsignificantly  reduced  since  this  arrangement  started  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1992.   There  were some incidents  in  the  first\r\n\r\nquarter   of  last  year  but  after  the  ISCP  stepped   up\r\n\r\nsurveillance  and patrols, there has been no  report  of  sea\r\n\r\nrobbery since\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmid-April  last  year. The navy has also been supporting  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of the Home Team to prevent illegal immigrants  from\r\n\r\nreaching our shores, both in the planning process as well  as\r\n\r\nin  assisting  the  Police Coast Guard at  sea  by  providing\r\n\r\nsurveillance  to  detect suspicious vessels carrying  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants. And the Navy will continue to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong and Dr Ong also asked about training\r\n\r\nsafety. The SAF takes training safety very seriously, whether\r\n\r\nthe training is conducted locally or overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the culture of training safety is deeply\r\n\r\ningrained  in  our system.  There is a strong and  continuous\r\n\r\nemphasis  by  commanders  at  all  levels  of  the  need  and\r\n\r\nimportance of safety training.  The process begins at all our\r\n\r\ntraining  schools  where future commanders  of  the  SAF  are\r\n\r\nexposed   routinely  to  briefing  and  frequent  updates  on\r\n\r\ntraining  safety so that they learn to accept  safety  as  an\r\n\r\nintegral part  of military training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for our ground commanders is not to avoid\r\n\r\ntraining  but  to  proactively  manage  these  activities  to\r\n\r\nminimise the  risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For training in unfamiliar training areas, both local\r\n\r\nand   overseas,   the  accompanying  risks   are   identified\r\n\r\nsystematically  through  the use of  Risk  Assessment  Matrix\r\n\r\nbeforehand.   Thereafter, the potential risks are proactively\r\n\r\ndealt  with through such measures as safety briefings, ground\r\n\r\norientation to unfamiliar terrain and rehearsals prior to the\r\n\r\nconduct of the actual training.\r\n\r\nSafety  audits are also carried out by Training Inspectorates\r\n\r\nin  the  Army, Navy and Airforce.  Lessons learnt from  their\r\n\r\naudits  are shared with other units and the findings  of  the\r\n\r\nInspectorates are routinely reported to the highest levels in\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Defence.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to report that these and other measures\r\n\r\ntaken by the SAF have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeen  effective.  The number of fatal accidents in  1997  was\r\n\r\nsix.   Last year, in 1999, there was unfortunately one  fatal\r\n\r\naccident.   The  number of training injuries dropped  by  45%\r\n\r\nbetween  1997  and 1999.  This improvement  is  a  result  of\r\n\r\nsustained efforts by the SAF to improve safety and  has  been\r\n\r\nachieved  without lowering the tempo of training and training\r\n\r\nstandards.    The SAF will strive to improve on this  because\r\n\r\neven one accident is one too many.  The SAF will continue  to\r\n\r\nensure that our training is realistic and, at the same  time,\r\n\r\ndevelop measures to proactively manage risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Ong Chit Chung has asked about optimising of\r\n\r\nland use.  The SAF works closely with other national agencies\r\n\r\nto  identify  commercially less viable areas  to  locate  its\r\n\r\nmilitary  camps and to conduct its training.  The development\r\n\r\nof  the  Basic  Military Training Centre and  the  School  of\r\n\r\nInfantry  Specialists complexes in Pulau Tekong  are  notable\r\n\r\nexamples.   New camp designs have allowed for more  intensive\r\n\r\nuse  of  land.   In  addition, where  possible,  bigger  camp\r\n\r\ncomplexes  are  built to replace several smaller  ones.   The\r\n\r\nsharing  of  common facilities and services in the  big  camp\r\n\r\ncomplexes has resulted in land savings.  As a result, in  the\r\n\r\nlast five years alone, a total of 27.48 hectares of land were\r\n\r\nreturned  by the SAF to the Land Office for other use.   This\r\n\r\nis quite considerable, given the activity level of Mindef and\r\n\r\nthe scarce land resources in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mindef also continually seeks out new construction\r\n\r\ntechnology  to optimise land use.  For example, in  1999,  we\r\n\r\nlaunched  the  plan  to  excavate  a  large  cavern  for   an\r\n\r\nunderground  ammunition  dump out  of  solid  granite.   This\r\n\r\ninnovative  solution  will free more  than  300  hectares  of\r\n\r\nsurface  land  area for more intensive use.  The  underground\r\n\r\nammunition  dump is located in Mandai and is expected  to  be\r\n\r\ncompleted in 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF has also invested heavily in simulators. The\r\n\r\nbenefits  are numerous.  Simulators provide a high degree  of\r\n\r\nrealism,  reducing the need for large training  areas.   Tank\r\n\r\ncrews are now trained\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nusing  the  Integrated Armour Tactical  Trainer.   Simulators\r\n\r\nalso  enable  training  to  be carried  out  under  different\r\n\r\nconditions,  some  of  which you cannot  do  even  with  live\r\n\r\ntraining.  We also train extensively overseas and this  helps\r\n\r\nto   relieve  the  problem  of  training  area  shortages  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  we  will continue to  use  our  scarce  land\r\n\r\nresources as well as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also asked about optimising training time. In\r\n\r\nthe  1990s, we took a fundamental review to ensure that full-time  National Service training is focused and that the  time\r\n\r\nspent  by full-time National Servicemen on mundane chores  is\r\n\r\nminimised.   Where  possible, maintenance  services  are  now\r\n\r\ncommercialised.  Full-time National Servicemen are no  longer\r\n\r\nrequired  to perform general housekeeping duties  for  common\r\n\r\nareas,  such as wash room cleaning, maintenance,  etc.   This\r\n\r\nenables  them to devote more time for training.  Some  people\r\n\r\ncomplain, especially the older National Servicemen,  that  we\r\n\r\nare  going soft.  But I think that if we can make use of  the\r\n\r\ntime  better  for  training and we can differentiate  between\r\n\r\nthings which are done for domestic purposes in the camps  and\r\n\r\nactual live training in the training areas, and keep the live\r\n\r\ntraining  in  the  training areas as realistic  as  possible,\r\n\r\nwhile  making the domestic aspects as convenient as possible,\r\n\r\nwe will still be able to achieve our objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, those who are fit, for example, those who\r\n\r\nhave  attained at least a NAFA silver before enlistment,  are\r\n\r\nexempted  from six weeks' physical training phase.   So  they\r\n\r\nare  enlisted later compared to those who did not  attain  at\r\n\r\nleast a silver and have to undergo the six-week programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also asked about time spent at ranges. I know it\r\n\r\nis very frustrating for people who go to the ranges.  We will\r\n\r\nsee  what more we can do.  But already we have done a  number\r\n\r\nof  things.   Simulators are used a lot more  for  train-fire\r\n\r\nwith  rifles  and that cuts down the number of  times  people\r\n\r\nneed to go to the range and makes more productive use of  the\r\n\r\ntime that they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndo  spend  on the range.  So it is quite common for  soldiers\r\n\r\nwho  go  for  the first time to the range now to score  very,\r\n\r\nvery  well,  because  they have become so  used  to  it  with\r\n\r\nsimulators.   We also have automated many of  the  ranges  so\r\n\r\nthat  soldiers  spend  much less time sticking  up  and  down\r\n\r\ntargets  and pasting targets by the butt party.  And we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to find better ways of doing this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For National Servicemen, we know the in-camp training is\r\n\r\ndisruptive to their civilian life and what we would  like  to\r\n\r\ndo  is  for the time that they are back in camp, to  use  the\r\n\r\ntime as usefully as possible.  For example, we minimise call-ups  on NSmen by grouping several activities together so that\r\n\r\nthey  would not be called up so many times.  I think  we  can\r\n\r\nstill do better.  We also do not call up all the NSmen in the\r\n\r\nunit  altogether.  We stagger it so that those  who  need  to\r\n\r\ncome back earlier like the Commanders and so forth, come back\r\n\r\nfirst,  and  the men come back later.  Also, Unit  Commanders\r\n\r\ncan  release  their units early if they achieve the  training\r\n\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also been using IT where we can. For example,\r\n\r\ntraining materials are given to NSmen in the form of CD-ROMs,\r\n\r\nso  that  they can train on their own and at their own  pace,\r\n\r\nwhereas  in  the  past we had to call them back  to  camp  to\r\n\r\nundergo  that  kind of training.  We will  continue  to  seek\r\n\r\nimprovements  so that time spent on training  to  prepare  to\r\n\r\ndefend the country is well used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some questions have been raised on National Education.\r\n\r\nNational  Education is a key element in helping to strengthen\r\n\r\nour  Total  Defence.   The Ministry  of  Defence  is  working\r\n\r\ntogether  with Ministry of Education and other Ministries  on\r\n\r\nTotal  Defence  and National Education, to make  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand  new Singaporeans more aware of the need to be loyal  and\r\n\r\nto  defend  Singapore.  And there is a coordinating committee\r\n\r\nchaired by PS (PMO), who is also the PS (Defence), to oversee\r\n\r\nthe  National  Education  effort undertaken  by  the  various\r\n\r\nMinistries and Government agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Ong for his complimentary\r\n\r\nremarks about the food.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nRegardless  of  that,  I  still  would  look  forward  to  an\r\n\r\ninvitation  to  his home for dinner.  I would  also  like  to\r\n\r\nthank  Mr  Ravindran for his compliments on the recent  Total\r\n\r\nDefence awareness programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran raised some points on defence science and\r\n\r\ntechnology  research.  Technology is strategic to Mindef  and\r\n\r\nthe  SAF.  As a small country with limited resources,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  for  us  to  leverage  on  others  to  obtain  the\r\n\r\ntechnology  we  need.  Mindef actively seeks out  centres  of\r\n\r\nexcellence  in  our  industries,  universities  and  research\r\n\r\ninstitutes, as well as those in other countries who are  open\r\n\r\nto   collaborate  with  us.   Of  course,  there   are   some\r\n\r\nlimitations because of security considerations, both on their\r\n\r\npart  and our part.  Mindef will continue to do this  in  the\r\n\r\nnew Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).  Funding is\r\n\r\nawarded  to the most competitive proposals and joint  funding\r\n\r\nis  the  norm where two or more parties are interested.   The\r\n\r\nDSTA  will  continue to look at the best ideas regardless  of\r\n\r\ntheir origin for the benefit of Mindef and the SAF.  In fact,\r\n\r\ntoday,  defence  R&D  is not just done in  the  DSO  National\r\n\r\nLaboratories  but also at our two universities  and  national\r\n\r\nresearch  institutes  as well as with foreign  partners.   We\r\n\r\nhave  been doing this with our universities for over 10 years\r\n\r\nand   a  number  of  dual-use  research  centres  have   been\r\n\r\nestablished  to  better  tap universities'  expertise.   This\r\n\r\neffort will be expanded further with the setting up of  DSTA.\r\n\r\nDSTA's funding for science and technology will be directed at\r\n\r\nsolving  problems of defence.  But this can often be  applied\r\n\r\nto   commercial  arena.   And  where  such  applications  are\r\n\r\nbeneficial to the nation, DSTA will be open to explore  their\r\n\r\nexploitation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Mindef does set aside a portion of its R&D\r\n\r\nfunding for the exploration of future technologies and system\r\n\r\nconcepts to ensure a good balance between technology push  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the demand pull.  That is, what the users want today\r\n\r\nand what the technology can offer perhaps tomorrow.  This has\r\n\r\nbeen an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nintegral  part of Mindef's policy on research and development\r\n\r\nfor  many  years.   This  approach  will  continue  with  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of DSTA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ravindran also asked about East Timor. During\r\n\r\nthe  INTERFET phase - from mid-September last year to the end\r\n\r\nof  February this year - Singapore contributed three  Landing\r\n\r\nShip  Tanks,  a  C-130 aircraft, a medical detachment  and  a\r\n\r\nmilitary liaison team.  Our LSTs were the main strategic lift\r\n\r\nassets of INTERFET.  I understand that they carried some  60%\r\n\r\nof  the  sea  lift  cargo  for INTERFET.   They  helped  meet\r\n\r\nINTERFET's surge requirements during the build-up  phase  and\r\n\r\ntransition to UNTAET, lifting about 2,400 tonnes of cargo  in\r\n\r\nall descriptions, shapes and sizes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of last month, our medical team had treated about\r\n\r\n6,500  people,  both  INTERFET  personnel  as  well  as  East\r\n\r\nTimorese.    All   in  all,  close  to  400   SAF   personnel\r\n\r\nparticipated in INTERFET.  And this number includes 43  full-time National Servicemen who have volunteered for the mission\r\n\r\nas well as eight regular servicewomen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For UNTAET, Singapore has contributed a 21-member SAF\r\n\r\nmedical  team, three military officers to UNTAET headquarters\r\n\r\nand  40  civilian  police  from the Singapore  Police  Force.\r\n\r\nSingapore is also prepared to provide technical assistance to\r\n\r\nEast Timor within our means.  We hope that East Timor will be\r\n\r\nable  to  achieve  a  smooth transition to  nationhood  under\r\n\r\nUNTAET.   But  East Timor's requirements for  rebuilding  the\r\n\r\ncountry  are  enormous,  and  the  assistance  of  the  whole\r\n\r\ninternational  community and not just the regional  countries\r\n\r\nwill be needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the threats to the safety of our personnel in\r\n\r\nEast  Timor, when we send our people to such missions and  in\r\n\r\nsuch  situations, there will always be some  inherent  risks.\r\n\r\nBut  our  people  are professionals, and I am confident  that\r\n\r\nthey are trained to deal with such eventualities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have dealt with most of the issues that\r\n\r\nMembers have raised.

As we have just finished\r\n\r\ndebate  on the Ministry of Defence, we are now entering  into\r\n\r\nan  area of social defence and this is a very important  area\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  examine and see how we can  strengthen  the\r\n\r\npeople sector.  We should particularly re-examine and revisit\r\n\r\nsome  of  these  areas  in  order to  see  how  we  can  make\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  more  caring and more supportive  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nothers  who need support within our community.  This is  very\r\n\r\ncritical because we need not only the hardware that  we  have\r\n\r\nbuilt  over  a  period of time, but also the  heartware.   We\r\n\r\nrequire people to build better communities.  This is an  area\r\n\r\nthat  we  feel more funding can be deployed so  that  in  the\r\n\r\nlonger  term,  we  will  be  able  to  build  a  more  viable\r\n\r\ncommunity. Singaporeans can be more reciprocal and be able to\r\n\r\nprovide  the necessary support to those Singaporeans who  may\r\n\r\nrequire assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, what I am saying is that those who can must\r\n\r\nsupport  those  who  cannot.  The  question  is:  how  do  we\r\n\r\nencourage  and  cajole Singaporeans who have the  ability  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to those who are less able than themselves?  To do\r\n\r\nthat,  I  would urge all Singaporeans to stand tall and  find\r\n\r\nways  that  they  can  contribute meaningfully  in  community\r\n\r\nbuilding and bring about a better social cohesion within  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have talked about the digital divide, we have talked\r\n\r\nabout  communities with different social classes; we want  to\r\n\r\nprevent abrasions in the community; we want to look at how we\r\n\r\ncan  socially  integrate communities and between  the  races,\r\n\r\nsocial  classes and the different intellectual gaps  that  we\r\n\r\nhave.   All  these are essentially important and we  have  to\r\n\r\nseriously  examine  what we can do as  a  community  so  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will be able to respond quickly to  participate\r\n\r\nin  social defence, an issue which remains very critical  and\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge our community to examine what each of us\r\n\r\ncan  contribute.  It requires serious gumption, analysis  and\r\n\r\nreview of what we can do, as Singaporeans, to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the social development of our community.   And\r\n\r\nwe  are  talking about people development, an issue which  is\r\n\r\nvery  important, other than defence and economy.  It  is  the\r\n\r\npeople sector that we will have to seriously look at and find\r\n\r\nways  and  new  strategies to see how we can  strengthen  the\r\n\r\ntenacity  and capacity of Singaporeans further.   This  is  a\r\n\r\nserious business because dealing with people is very complex.\r\n\r\nAnd  it is a very complex issue that requires the examination\r\n\r\nmobilisation  of  different effective  people  strategies  to\r\n\r\nbuild   people  to  be  better  people.   I  hope  my  fellow\r\n\r\nParliamentarians will be able to join me to see  how  we  can\r\n\r\nencourage  and support the Ministry of Community  Development\r\n\r\nto  undertake  its new mission and role because the  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  added  a  new  portfolio, that  is,  sports  within  its\r\n\r\npurview.   This  is a welcomed change and  we  are  not  only\r\n\r\ntrying  to  build a sporting community, but also a  group  of\r\n\r\npeople who are viable, caring and supportive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must draw your attention that we will be facing\r\n\r\nserious consequences in view of our declining population.  As\r\n\r\nyou  know,  we are now having about eight persons  supporting\r\n\r\none  retiree.  In about 20 years, it will be half.   We  will\r\n\r\nhave  only  four  persons supporting one retiree  and  it  is\r\n\r\nindeed  a burden that we will be running into.  It is a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  arena and Singaporeans need to examine  what  they\r\n\r\ncan  do  to  arrest  this  declining  population  other  than\r\n\r\nallowing  immigrants  and  others to  come  in  and  inviting\r\n\r\nforeign  talents  and  other  people  to  contribute  to  our\r\n\r\neconomy.  Singaporeans themselves must critically study  what\r\n\r\nthey  can do to contribute to this declining population  that\r\n\r\nwe have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue would have serious ramifications for our\r\n\r\ncommunity,   as   you  would  appreciate.    We   will   have\r\n\r\ninsufficient people to defend ourselves.  We have just talked\r\n\r\nabout  defence.    We  will have less people  to  defend  our\r\n\r\nnation  and  to participate in National Service.  Eventually,\r\n\r\nwhat do we do?  Where do we get sufficient people to serve in\r\n\r\nthe National Service?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDr  Ong, Member for Bukit Timah GRC, has just spoken that  we\r\n\r\nhave  a very viable defence policy.  But there is nothing  to\r\n\r\ndefend  if we do not have any people.  That is an issue  that\r\n\r\nwe  need  to look at very seriously.  It is indeed a  serious\r\n\r\nbusiness that we need to examine and see how we can encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to replace themselves.  It is very important  to\r\n\r\nfind a reasonable replacement level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are unable to defend ourselves, where do we get\r\n\r\nthe  people?   If we do not have enough people,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nimport  mercenaries to defend us.  That is a serious question\r\n\r\nwhich we have to look into.  I hope that we would not get  to\r\n\r\nthat stage.  Therefore, we will have to see how we can cajole\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to find a reasonable replacement for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other serious consequence is that we will have less\r\n\r\nmanpower  to man our social and economic sectors.  This  will\r\n\r\nin  the  long term affect our viability.  I am sure you  will\r\n\r\nagree  with me that we require people to manage the  economy,\r\n\r\nrun  the  industries and to meet the challenges ahead.   That\r\n\r\nyou  will  require  the  people's contributions.   With  less\r\n\r\npeople  available, the burden will increase in the  hands  of\r\n\r\nthe few that we have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we do not have enough people, the economy is likely\r\n\r\nto  run  down.  We will become less productive and  therefore\r\n\r\nless able to manage and mobilise resources to revitalise  and\r\n\r\nmake further economic progress.  That is a very serious issue\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  to  think about.  Who is  going  to  man  the\r\n\r\nindustries,  the  manufacturing  sector  and  the   different\r\n\r\nenterprises that we have?  We have talked about a  knowledge-based economy.  We have talked about entrepreneurship.  If we\r\n\r\ndo  not  have  people,  all this comes  to  naught.  But  the\r\n\r\nquestion is whether we would be able to arrive at that  level\r\n\r\nif we are going to face the problems of population decline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw the attention of Members that our\r\n\r\nreplacement rate, in the last 20 years, had fallen  from  2.8\r\n\r\nin 1970 to 1.5 in 1998.  Therefore, we are reducing by nearly\r\n\r\nhalf.  This is indeed a very important issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me try and round up, Sir. There are some pressing\r\n\r\nissues that I need to highlight and I hope you will give me a\r\n\r\nfew minutes to just round up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will give you one minute.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> We have young people whom we need to cajole.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is very important that we give them  the  right\r\n\r\nsignals.  I appreciate that it is a challenging task to bring\r\n\r\nup  children.  There are different complex issues facing  the\r\n\r\nfamily  today and we need to appreciate some of the  problems\r\n\r\nso that we can make child rearing and bringing up children  a\r\n\r\npleasant  task.  But it is a challenging task,  I  must  say,\r\n\r\nbecause there are competing demands on the family itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Community Development is trying its\r\n\r\nbest  to  strengthen  the  work  of  the  Family  Development\r\n\r\nDivision.  And I feel it has a very important role to play in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  more  programmes to  support  young  families  in\r\n\r\nchildcare  and encouraging the bringing up of more  children.\r\n\r\nSo  the  issue of procreation requires the attention of  more\r\n\r\nMinistries  than MCD.  I do not think that MCD is sterile  of\r\n\r\nideas.  Given the current resources, MCD is doing a good  job\r\n\r\nand with more help given it can be effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Dr Vasoo, that is enough. Please\r\n\r\nresume your seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, pleading the cause of the family\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for Community Development is not just  like\r\n\r\npreaching  to  the  converted, but  to  the  bishop  himself.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  I  think it may sometimes be  useful  for  the\r\n\r\nbishop  to  be  able  to say to the other monsignors  at  the\r\n\r\nVatican that the parishioners are clamouring for attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has laid out in great detail the philosophical\r\n\r\nand conceptual ground work on which we can start this debate.\r\n\r\nI  am  going  to  talk  about  a  few  nitty-gritty  details.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  I  am  really very happy to see in the  budget  the\r\n\r\nprovision  for 49 new childcare centres and 25  student  care\r\n\r\ncentres.   I  remember previous briefings that  I  have  had,\r\n\r\nwhile serving on various\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommittees,  from MCD officers who have spoken  of  plans  to\r\n\r\ngradually  increase child and student care  centres.   And  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  commend the Ministry  for  delivering  these\r\n\r\ncommitments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49 childcare centres equate to about one new childcare\r\n\r\ncentre  every  week  and 25 student care centres,  one  every\r\n\r\nfortnight.   However, numbers, although  important,  are  not\r\n\r\nthe  be-all  and  end-all of the issue.  The recruitment  and\r\n\r\ntraining  of  childcare  teachers  and  assistants,  both  in\r\n\r\nnumbers  and  in calibre, remain a concern.  Last  year,  MCD\r\n\r\ndeveloped   guidelines   for   qualifications   required   of\r\n\r\nsupervisors  and  teachers  in  early  childhood   care   and\r\n\r\neducation.  But I suspect that we may be in a bit of  a  bind\r\n\r\nhere  as  the  poor  salaries that these  jobs  command  will\r\n\r\nattract and retain staff of only a certain level of education\r\n\r\nand  calibre.  Yet attractive salaries can only  be  afforded\r\n\r\nwith  higher fees and/or higher subsidies.  I wonder  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister can share with us if there is any review plan  being\r\n\r\nundertaken on this subject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards and quality of care provided, methodology used\r\n\r\nand curriculum covered and their consistency across the range\r\n\r\nof  centres run by different operators with childcare centres\r\n\r\nunder the supervision of MCD and kindergartens under MOE  are\r\n\r\na  major  concern,  and  there  has  been  an  extensive  and\r\n\r\nimpassioned media coverage of the subject in recent weeks.  I\r\n\r\nwill  not delve on the subject here as I know the whole issue\r\n\r\nof  pre-school  is currently being reviewed  by  a  committee\r\n\r\nunder  Senior Minister of State for Education, Dr Aline Wong,\r\n\r\nwith participation and representation from MCD.  I am sure we\r\n\r\nwill get a comprehensive and lively debate on the subject  of\r\n\r\npre-school education under the MOE cuts.  Suffice for  me  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  I  do hope that many issues brought up  in  public\r\n\r\ndiscussion in recent weeks will be ironed out and we will see\r\n\r\na  system put into place which will put a stop to the  spiral\r\n\r\nof increasing expectations on our very young children.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other item, with regard to childcare centres for the\r\n\r\nMinister's consideration is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhether  the  provision of infant care services for  children\r\n\r\nfrom 2 to 18 months can be encouraged, through increasing the\r\n\r\nsubsidy for this service to offset the higher cost that comes\r\n\r\nfrom  the  higher  staffing ratios that  this  age  group  of\r\n\r\nchildren require.  Currently, very few childcare centres take\r\n\r\nin  children below 18 months and it will be most  helpful  to\r\n\r\nthose  parents who wish to use such a service if more  places\r\n\r\nwere available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving to student care centres, my main request here is\r\n\r\nfor more school-based centres, as I believe this will be much\r\n\r\nmore  convenient for parents who would then not need to worry\r\n\r\nabout transporting the child to and from school and community-based  centres.  For both child and student care  centres,  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  Minister  will periodically  review  subsidy\r\n\r\nlevels.  As the financial burden of childcare arrangement  is\r\n\r\nnot  insignificant, even with the Government  subsidies,  the\r\n\r\ndollars  quickly  add up, especially if the family  needs  to\r\n\r\ncare for more than one child.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to get into\r\n\r\nthe  debate  again.   The family is under  competing  demands\r\n\r\ntoday.  As  you know, many of them are dual income  families.\r\n\r\nThey  have to look after children.  They have to manage their\r\n\r\nwork,  and  they  have to cope with their household  demands.\r\n\r\nThese  are  issues  we need to address and I  understand  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Community Development has set up various  support\r\n\r\nservices  for  the families but I think it is very  important\r\n\r\nfor us to understand the changes that have taken place in the\r\n\r\nfamily  and  there are more changes to come.  There  will  be\r\n\r\nvarious  competing demands on the families of the future.  It\r\n\r\nis  important  that  we set up at least an  Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Family Life and Development to look  into  the\r\n\r\nmatter more carefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Ministry alone will not be able to\r\n\r\nmanage  and  tackle  the  problem  because  it  requires  the\r\n\r\nintervention  of  other Ministries.  Therefore,  it  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant that we draw the participation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  other  Ministries to examine the issues  of  family  life\r\n\r\nwhich  have implications on young children and young persons.\r\n\r\nIn  relation  to  this,  we  are  also  concerned  about  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  number of issues related to juvenile  delinquency\r\n\r\nbecause  families are unable to provide care and  supervision\r\n\r\nfor  some  of them.  We have latchkey children and  therefore\r\n\r\nthere  is  an  increase in juvenile-related problems  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  this problem is related to the  family  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.  I  would like to find out from the Minister what  has\r\n\r\nhappened  to  the revision to the Children and Young  Persons\r\n\r\nAct  and  what steps would be taken to deal with the juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with sports, to encourage children and\r\n\r\nyoung  persons to become sportsmen, and as we want  to  be  a\r\n\r\nsporting nation, we need to produce a number of international\r\n\r\nsportsmen.   There  is a need to mobilise more  resources  to\r\n\r\npromote outstanding sportsmen in the different areas. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to find out from the Minister what plans there  are  to\r\n\r\ndeal with the whole issue of sports and sports development.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to comment on how youth affairs are managed  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   To the best of my knowledge, there are  a  whole\r\n\r\nrange of organisations that deal with matters of interest and\r\n\r\nimportance  to youth. We have the People's Association  Youth\r\n\r\nMovement,   which  is  involved  through  its   multi-various\r\n\r\nagencies  in  the  community  centres,  the  Youth  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittees. We have the National Youth Council, which is also\r\n\r\ninvolved in youth-related affairs but largely working through\r\n\r\nVWOs.  The Ministry of Community Development itself has  some\r\n\r\ndegree   of  focus  on  youth-related  matters  through   its\r\n\r\ndivision,  and  other Ministries, such  as  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation and the Ministry of Home Affairs, for example, deal\r\n\r\nwith  certain  aspects  of their work which  pertain  to  the\r\n\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not be far-fetched to argue that there would be\r\n\r\nsignificant scope for synergy in bringing some of the issues\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntogether  in dealing with matters that affect the  youth.  In\r\n\r\nparticular,  Sir, about a week or so ago, the National  Youth\r\n\r\nCouncil held a seminar with young Singaporeans in which  many\r\n\r\nvoiced  out  this concern, that is, whether the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe youth are well-taken care of, especially when we have  an\r\n\r\nageing population which will appear, at least, in theory,  to\r\n\r\ncompete with the interest of the young and also as many other\r\n\r\nsocial   pressures  are  brought  to  bear   on   our   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have for the Minister then is whether\r\n\r\nthere is scope to establish a focused central body, perhaps a\r\n\r\nstatutory  board,  or a department under  the  aegis  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Community Development, to address youth  matters\r\n\r\non  a  holistic basis. This could be a variation of  what  we\r\n\r\nalready have, in the form of the NYC or the PAYM or it  could\r\n\r\nbe  something entirely new and it need not encroach into  the\r\n\r\nareas that are traditionally the responsibility of MOE or the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Home  Affairs. But  certainly,  on  the  social\r\n\r\naspects of youth matters, this can be addressed.   There have\r\n\r\nbeen  calls for a Youth Ministry but I suspect the  arguments\r\n\r\nthere  are not strong enough or compelling enough, but  there\r\n\r\nis  a  reasonable  case  to be made for  a  more  centralised\r\n\r\napproach to coordinate certain efforts targeted at the youth.\r\n\r\nI  would  appreciate  it  if the Minister  could  give  us  a\r\n\r\nresponse on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the dual-income families are a normal\r\n\r\nphenomenon in Singapore these days and female workers account\r\n\r\nfor about 40% of our total workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contributions of women to their families and to\r\n\r\ntheir  country  are indeed substantial.  A  majority  of  our\r\n\r\nworking  women  are  holding full-time jobs,  just  like  our\r\n\r\nworking   men.   But  women  continue  to  bear  the  primary\r\n\r\nresponsibility for family and childcare tasks.  Studies  have\r\n\r\nfound that women in dual-income marriages encounter more role\r\n\r\noverload  than their husbands. Working mothers, who are  torn\r\n\r\nbetween  the demands of home and the workplace, are sometimes\r\n\r\ntroubled by problems such as unsupportive and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndemanding  husbands, and rebellious and wayward children.  On\r\n\r\ntop of all these family problems is job stress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to beseech the Ministry of Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment to look at the help that can be rendered  to  our\r\n\r\ndual-income  families  to  support  them.   If  we   can   be\r\n\r\nsuccessful in this area, we will be able to ensure more ideal\r\n\r\nfamilies,  especially in areas of stronger marriages,  better\r\n\r\nprocreation  and stable families.  It will  be  best  if  the\r\n\r\neffort  in  this  area is done jointly  by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity   Development   together   with   other   concerned\r\n\r\nMinistries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very important that we encourage a change in\r\n\r\nthe mindset of many Singaporeans.  Husbands cannot depend  on\r\n\r\ntheir  wives  to care for the entire household and  parenting\r\n\r\ntasks  and, at the same time, bring in additional income  for\r\n\r\nthe family. Many men see participation in household tasks and\r\n\r\nchild  rearing as a threat to their masculinity.   There  was\r\n\r\none Aryee's research in 1992 in Singapore that found that job-homemaker  conflict  experienced  by  professional  women  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   is   significantly  reduced  when  the   husbands\r\n\r\ncontributed  more hours in doing housework.  Spouse  support,\r\n\r\nboth physical and emotional, is therefore a vital recipe  for\r\n\r\nworking  women to cope better and a formula for a  successful\r\n\r\nmarriage. The Ministry of Community Development should  steer\r\n\r\na campaign on this issue urgently and successfully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Childcare is always an essential consideration for many\r\n\r\ndual-income  families.  The Ministry of Community Development\r\n\r\nshould  therefore  continue  to provide  for  more  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres.  Could  the Ministry of Community  Development  also\r\n\r\nprovide  other new childcare assistance initiatives  such  as\r\n\r\n\"share-a-maid\" and \"borrow-a-granny\" schemes?  Sir, with  the\r\n\r\n\"borrow-a-granny\" scheme, a retired but well and able elderly\r\n\r\nbaby-sits  on  an ad-hoc basis for other residents  in  their\r\n\r\nconstituency. Such a scheme is best operated from our Centres\r\n\r\nof  Activity for the Retired and Elderly where there are many\r\n\r\nsuitable elderly who may be willing to render such a service.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be beneficial if the Ministry of Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and  the Ministry of Manpower  work  closely  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate flexible work arrangements for working women.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment   may  consider  providing  more   incentives   to\r\n\r\nencourage  this  arrangement  and  to  ensure  its   success.\r\n\r\nEmployers  should be encouraged to transform  part-time  work\r\n\r\nfrom  being  temporary and casual in  nature  to  that  of  a\r\n\r\npermanent  scheme,  in  terms of job security,  remuneration,\r\n\r\nbenefits,  training  and  promotion prospects  to  the  part-timers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that is worthy of attention is job security\r\n\r\nwhile families are pursuing procreation. Could the Government\r\n\r\npersuade  employers, maybe in the form of certain incentives,\r\n\r\nto  allow women to take longer unpaid maternity leave (up  to\r\n\r\none  year)  to care for their infants? Would the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity   Development,   in   collaboration   with    other\r\n\r\nMinistries, for example, Ministry of Manpower, facilitate the\r\n\r\noption  of  job  sharing?   This has  worked  well  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries  and  a significant number of working  mothers  job\r\n\r\nshared  effectively. Could we also look at more opportunities\r\n\r\nbeing  made  available for working women to  work  from  home\r\n\r\neither  on  a  part-time or full-time  basis?   Yet,  another\r\n\r\nconsideration is for the Government to approve paid leave for\r\n\r\na  parent  to  care  for  sick children.  This  should  apply\r\n\r\nequally, both to a mother and to a father, and this will be a\r\n\r\nstrong  signal from the Government in encouraging  the  equal\r\n\r\nrole of child parenting in our families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Community Development could\r\n\r\nconsider  these  issues and help us have our families  strong\r\n\r\nand stable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, may I take my two cuts together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Sure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, MCD runs a family life education\r\n\r\nprogramme.   The Ministry, through its various  agencies  and\r\n\r\nworking with other Ministries, for example, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health,  runs  a  whole  series  of  talks  and\r\n\r\norganises workshops and seminars and produces a massive array\r\n\r\nof  brochures and publications on marriage, married life  and\r\n\r\nparenting.  Unfortunately, the reach of these efforts is very\r\n\r\nlimited.  The people who come for the talks and pick  up  the\r\n\r\nbrochures  are the ones already in the right church,  sitting\r\n\r\nin  the right pew, nodding their heads in agreement with  the\r\n\r\nsermon.   The  vast  majority of  Singaporeans  are,  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime, carrying on chasing economic success with  no  time\r\n\r\nat all to pay any attention to matters which, to them, are of\r\n\r\nsuch  secondary importance.  Life in Singapore is couched  in\r\n\r\neconomic  terms,  that  is, gains and profits,  productivity,\r\n\r\nvalue-added  propositions and marketability. We  have  little\r\n\r\ntime for family relationships and values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Singaporeans are delaying marriage and the\r\n\r\ncommonly  cited  reason  is  to achieve  financial  stability\r\n\r\nfirst.  The  importance  of marriage  as  an  institution  is\r\n\r\nundermined  by  the  monetary value  attached  to  the  first\r\n\r\nmatrimonial home that young couples aspire to own. I know  of\r\n\r\ntwo young couples who rushed to the ROM to get registered  to\r\n\r\nget  into the HDB queue, only to now be filing for separation\r\n\r\nafter finding out that they are not so compatible for a life-time   together   after   all.   Parents   abdicating   their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  to  domestic helpers in  their  efforts  to\r\n\r\npursue  careers so they can afford the trappings of  material\r\n\r\nsuccess.    Students   are  focused   totally   on   academic\r\n\r\nachievement.  Who has time for values?\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a much more concerted and comprehensive effort\r\n\r\nto  address this culture and mindset which we have  built  up\r\n\r\nover  the  past  couple of decades than it is  possible  with\r\n\r\nMCD's  current resources available for family life education.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to  involve and engage many more  agencies  in  all\r\n\r\nsectors,   public,  private  and  people,   the   media   and\r\n\r\nindividuals  themselves.  We should start in our  schools  to\r\n\r\nbroaden  the  life skills programme to include  making  right\r\n\r\nlife   choices,  gender  sensitivity,  civil   and   familial\r\n\r\nresponsibilities and care giving skills.  We need to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthink of all the ways we can reach out to catch the attention\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans, the young and the not so young as well,  as\r\n\r\nthey set the examples for the younger ones to follow, through\r\n\r\nthe  community, CDCs and grassroots organisations,  VWOs  and\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunity Development spoke over the weekend about  a  family\r\n\r\nlife ambassador initiative which the Ministry is preparing to\r\n\r\nlaunch with companies at workplaces.  We need this and  other\r\n\r\nsuch  efforts.   Hospitals could work with MCD  and  VWOs  to\r\n\r\nreach young couples who come to these institutions when  they\r\n\r\nhave  their first and subsequent babies.  My own hospital  is\r\n\r\nworking on one such initiative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD can be the resource centre preparing the\r\n\r\ninformational, training and counselling materials, doing  the\r\n\r\nresearch  on trends and tracking other countries' experiences\r\n\r\nfor   us   to  learn  from,  and  the  coordinator  and   the\r\n\r\nfacilitator.   But  we  need many,  many  more  parties,  all\r\n\r\nsectors and individuals to be engaged in this effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has asked for an Inter-Ministerial Committee to\r\n\r\nbe  established  to  bring together a coordinated  effort  to\r\n\r\nsustaining  and  strengthening  the  Singapore   family.    I\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly support his call.  Obviously, many  Ministries\r\n\r\nmust  be engaged in this.  It is hard to divide clearly where\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility  and  impact of one  Ministry  stops  and\r\n\r\nanother begins.  I understand, of course, that there  may  be\r\n\r\nother  similar  requests for such attention to  be  given  to\r\n\r\nother issues that cut across Ministries, especially with  the\r\n\r\nfine  example  of  the  effectiveness  of  such  an  approach\r\n\r\nfollowing  upon  the good work done by the  Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Aging Population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation, I would like to suggest that every one\r\n\r\nor  alternate years, the Prime Minister's Office selects  one\r\n\r\nmajor  issue of concern for which an IMC be set up  to  drive\r\n\r\nand coordinate the national effort.  And the first one on the\r\n\r\nlist must surely be an IMC on the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, we read in the\r\n\r\npapers recently that babies were abandoned by parents.   Some\r\n\r\nwere  left at rubbish bins.  One was even found in the toilet\r\n\r\nbowl.  Although the number is still small, there seems to  be\r\n\r\nan  increasing trend since 1996.   These babies are at  great\r\n\r\nrisk  and may even die if they are not found in time.  May  I\r\n\r\nask  the Minister what is being done to educate young  people\r\n\r\nabout  the  help  that  they can receive  even  if  they  are\r\n\r\npregnant?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also want to know what studies have been done to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  profile of the parents who  abandoned  their\r\n\r\nbabies.   What  percentage of abandoned babies were  reunited\r\n\r\nwith their parents?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cities such as Hamburg in Germany where about 20\r\n\r\nbabies  were  abandoned  in  a  year,  the  authorities  have\r\n\r\nintroduced  what  is  known as babies slot,  where  desperate\r\n\r\nmothers  can deposit unwanted babies.  When a baby is  placed\r\n\r\nin the chute located at a daycare centre, it will fall into a\r\n\r\nwarm bed and is then registered at that centre.  Parents were\r\n\r\ngiven  a few months to change their mind and they claim  back\r\n\r\nthe  baby.   Some  other  cities in  developed  nations  have\r\n\r\nimplemented similar baby deposits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the Minister's view of such a baby deposit?\r\n\r\nCould  the Ministry try out one pilot site with a  VWO?   The\r\n\r\nwhole idea is to try to save as many babies as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, building a cohesive and resilient\r\n\r\nsociety by fostering strong and stable families is one of the\r\n\r\nmissions of the Ministry of Community Development.   The  way\r\n\r\nMCD  aims to achieve this target is to try and reinforce  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  marriage, procreation and family.  As  dual-income\r\n\r\nfamilies have become the norm in Singapore, childcare  issues\r\n\r\nhave  also become an important component for the MCD and  its\r\n\r\nmission.   I  would like, therefore, to raise  the  following\r\n\r\nissues in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a shortfall of about 20% of childcare\r\n\r\ncentres  at the moment.  Some popular centres have, in  fact,\r\n\r\nan uncomfortable waiting list of a few years. What\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  the steps taken by the Ministry of Community Development\r\n\r\nto  address  this  shortfall?  Could  the  MCD  rectify  this\r\n\r\nshortfall as soon as possible?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New and densely built condominiums with many young\r\n\r\nfamilies  are the ones that need childcare centres the  most.\r\n\r\nDisappointingly,  they are the ones that  have  no  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres within easy reach.   Residents of  new HDB flats have\r\n\r\nto  wait  quite  a  while to get their  centres.   Could  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Community Development have better provision  and\r\n\r\nplanning, in collaboration with other relevant Ministries, so\r\n\r\nthat sites for childcare centres for both the private and HDB\r\n\r\nestates can be designated?  Sir, I hope that when it comes to\r\n\r\nnational  issues like this, the Government will  not  aim  to\r\n\r\ncater  only for the public housing residents.  The Government\r\n\r\nshould  provide for all Singaporeans to reinforce the  values\r\n\r\nof marriage, procreation and family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some private childcare centres are doing very well\r\n\r\nand are in great demand.  However, many VWO childcare centres\r\n\r\ncannot  do  as well, because they are stifled by Government's\r\n\r\nintervention  in  \"fees  fixing\".  May  I  suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment allow privatisation of the VWO childcare  centres?\r\n\r\nThe  Government could instead subsidise the more  needy  end-users.   A  \"means  test\" could be applied.   The  Government\r\n\r\nshould have a hands-off approach in the actual setting up  or\r\n\r\nrunning of such centres.  Let more private organisations  run\r\n\r\nsuch   centres.   The  Government  should  just  confine   to\r\n\r\nstipulating  certain basic requirements to  ensure  standards\r\n\r\nand  conformity.  Some may cite the fear of escalation in the\r\n\r\nprices  charged  by VWO childcare centres  as  the  stumbling\r\n\r\nblock  for  such an idea.  Sir, this fear will  be  unfounded\r\n\r\nwhen  there  is  competition and prices are  reached  through\r\n\r\nmarket forces.  Furthermore, the Government can still control\r\n\r\nthe market through planned release of permits or premises for\r\n\r\nchildcare centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Community Development could\r\n\r\ngive us a favourable response to my above-mentioned requests.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, currently, there are 532 childcare\r\n\r\ncentres providing service to more than 33,759 children.  With\r\n\r\nso  many  childcare centres set up by different organisations\r\n\r\nranging from VWOs to profit-making entities, there must be  a\r\n\r\nvariation  in the standard of service.  While there  are  MCD\r\n\r\nguidelines  on  the  physical  standards  of  the   childcare\r\n\r\ncentres, there are variations in the service provided by  the\r\n\r\nchildcare  teachers.  Has the Ministry done  any  studies  to\r\n\r\nprofile  the  different  standards  of  service  and  try  to\r\n\r\nnormalise the standards?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October last year, MCD announced that in five years'\r\n\r\ntime,  the  qualification  requirement  for  supervisors   of\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres would be raised from the current  advanced\r\n\r\ncertificate level to diploma level.  I support this  move  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  to  raise the quality of care  which  children\r\n\r\nreceive in the childcare centres.  Many families make use  of\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres and the children spend long hours  in  the\r\n\r\ncentre.  It is therefore important that the centre is able to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  nurturing  and stimulating  environment  for  the\r\n\r\nchildren.  Recent research has shown that the early years  of\r\n\r\na  child's  development is crucial and can have  a  long-term\r\n\r\nimpact.   This  adds to the need to focus attention  on  this\r\n\r\narea.   Since  the  Ministry is raising the standard  of  the\r\n\r\nsupervisors,  is  there  any plan to  gradually  improve  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of the childcare teachers and to raise the standard\r\n\r\nof service?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that the Ministry has licensed childcare\r\n\r\ncentres  for many years.

I\r\n\r\nhope  that MCD would empathise with the worried young parents\r\n\r\nand  should not only depend solely on the old data of  demand\r\n\r\nand supply.  We should also consider other factors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, working mothers' participation in the\r\n\r\nworkforce is relatively low compared to other countries.  The\r\n\r\nmain  factor  is because there is no one to look after  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  Can we do as in the European countries to  provide\r\n\r\nmore  subsidy to professional childcare providers  so  as  to\r\n\r\nencourage  more women to go back to work?  More  importantly,\r\n\r\nproviding   more   childcare  facilities  will   reduce   our\r\n\r\ndependence on foreign domestic help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now have 100,000 foreign maids. I hope that we\r\n\r\nshould  let children in the 3-6 years old age group be looked\r\n\r\nafter by well qualified and trained childcare operators,  and\r\n\r\nwe  should  not  leave them to foreign maids  who  come  from\r\n\r\ndifferent  cultural and language backgrounds.  The  formative\r\n\r\nages  of  3-6 years old are very important to the development\r\n\r\nof children.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, marriages to foreigners have been\r\n\r\na   subject  that  has  received  much  media  publicity  and\r\n\r\ninterest.   Not  too long ago, we read in  the  papers  of  a\r\n\r\nwidely  publicised divorce between a lady from  Shanghai  and\r\n\r\nthe son of a family that runs a successful shipping business.\r\n\r\nThat  case generated much interest because of the substantial\r\n\r\namount  of  money  which  this lady  received  following  the\r\n\r\ndivorce.  In the minds of many Singaporeans, I am sure, is of\r\n\r\nthe view that this lady from China had a windfall as, but for\r\n\r\nthe  marriage,  she would probably not have acquired  even  a\r\n\r\nfraction of the assets that were given to her.  This case has\r\n\r\nalso  left  many  Singaporeans wondering  whether  this  lady\r\n\r\nactually married the man for his money.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not passing judgment here, as I do not think I\r\n\r\nam  in  a position to.  However, this anecdote does highlight\r\n\r\none  potential  problem of Singaporeans marrying  foreigners.\r\n\r\nObjectively  speaking, one would often ask how many  of  such\r\n\r\nmarriages are really out of feelings for one another and  how\r\n\r\nmany are contracted by the foreign party as a means to escape\r\n\r\nthe  harsh realities of the home environment, and that  there\r\n\r\nwas not any serious intention of settling down with the party\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me tell you yet another story. A constituent\r\n\r\ncame  to  see  me  one  day.  He walks with  a  limp  and  is\r\n\r\nhandicapped and I learned subsequently that he is handicapped\r\n\r\nbecause of a gunshot injury that he received in the course of\r\n\r\nhis  duty as a policeman.  He was compensated for his injury.\r\n\r\nUpon his discharge from the force, he managed to set up stall\r\n\r\nas a canteen operator to support himself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, life was lonely for him. Being unable to marry\r\n\r\na  local lady, this man resorted to looking for a bride  from\r\n\r\nChina.   He  found one from a big city and married  her.   He\r\n\r\nthought he had found marital bliss.  This was not to  be.   I\r\n\r\nlearned that his wife was not really keen on helping  him  to\r\n\r\nmanage  his  business.   Soon she  left  him  and  filed  for\r\n\r\ndivorce,  even though, as he claimed, he  had been very  nice\r\n\r\nto her.  She claimed a substantial portion of his assets, and\r\n\r\neven  got  his car seized to satisfy the order of court.   On\r\n\r\ntop of it all, he tells me that she started cohabiting with a\r\n\r\nman  in  the  same flat that she paid for out of the  monthly\r\n\r\nmaintenance  sum that he gives her.   This man  has  seen  me\r\n\r\nmany times and pleads for justice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not hear the full story. It may be that she\r\n\r\ngenuinely wanted to start a new life with another man, or  it\r\n\r\nmay  be  that  she  is  the devious scheming  lady  who  took\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  my constituent.  If the latter were  true,  it\r\n\r\nwould indeed be a tragedy for him.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This episode raises a basic question of whether the\r\n\r\nState has any responsibility\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntowards  Singaporeans of similar circumstances  that  I  have\r\n\r\ndescribed.   I  know that it would not be  possible  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to keep a look-out for every Singaporean  who  is\r\n\r\ngullible or weak.  Neither can it be said that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  no  duty  in a situation like this.  Instinctively,  our\r\n\r\nsense  of  justice  tells  us  that  what  has  happened   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who married scheming spouses who took them for a\r\n\r\nride,  is  not  right.   It is not easy  to  deal  with  this\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, given the immense trauma that broken marriages\r\n\r\nbring  about,  I would like to ask the Minister  to  consider\r\n\r\ngetting proper marriage counsellors to help Singaporeans come\r\n\r\nto  a  carefully  thought  out  decision.  Additionally,  the\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter is primarily meant to protect the rights  of\r\n\r\nwomen.  However, the Women's Charter should not be abused  by\r\n\r\nothers  for  their own benefit.  This was certainly  not  the\r\n\r\nintention  of this House and should not be seen by others  as\r\n\r\nsuch.   Perhaps  the Women's Charter should  be  looked  into\r\n\r\nagain to see how such abuses can be avoided.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): According to\r\n\r\nthe  records, there is a clear decline in our birth  rate  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   In 1988, the average birth rate was  1.96  child\r\n\r\nper  family.   In  1999, it has reduced to 1.48  per  family.\r\n\r\nThis  clear  decline of birth rate  is a very serious  trend.\r\n\r\nWe are already approaching Japan's low birth rate of 1.42 per\r\n\r\nfamily.   We  have to do something seriously and urgently  to\r\n\r\naddress the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s, the problem then was that there were some\r\n\r\nhighly  educated people who were not married.   Now,  in  the\r\n\r\n1990s  the problem is further extended. Even among  the  non-graduates,  there  are  many who  are  not  getting  married.\r\n\r\nAccording  to statistics, about 15% of  our people above  the\r\n\r\nage of 40 are single.  Our society has also faced the problem\r\n\r\nof people getting married very late and had their first child\r\n\r\nlate.  The average age of having the first child increases to\r\n\r\n28.5  last year from the 27.5 in 1990.  The situation now  is\r\n\r\nthat we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  unable to replace ourselves.  This would imply  that  in\r\n\r\nfuture we would face the problem of an ageing population  and\r\n\r\nit will affect us socially and politically.  As it is, we are\r\n\r\nexpecting that by 2030 every four economically active persons\r\n\r\nwill have to support one senior citizen above the age of  65.\r\n\r\nSo  our  economic  burden  will be very  heavy  and  it  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  affect our quality of life.  More importantly,  we\r\n\r\nmay  not be able to look after our aged relatives and we  may\r\n\r\nhave to depend on foreign maids to look after them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, our economic prospects for the 21st\r\n\r\ncentury  are quite  optimistic. We are forecasting some  5-7%\r\n\r\nannual  growth  rate.   However, if  our  population  is  not\r\n\r\ngrowing  enough in the next 30 years, this vision of  a  5-7%\r\n\r\nannual growth rate cannot be sustained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Dr Vasoo asked Dr Ong who is going to defend\r\n\r\nus in time of war.  Even with the most sophisticated weapons,\r\n\r\nif  we  do  not  have enough people, who shall operate  these\r\n\r\nweapons  to  defend us?  If we cannot replace ourselves,  our\r\n\r\npopulation  will  shrink  and we may  have  problems  in  our\r\n\r\nnational defence in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, our Minister for National Development\r\n\r\npainted  a  picture  of how Singapore is going  to  become  a\r\n\r\nvibrant  city, that is,  by the year 2040.  Our society  will\r\n\r\nbe  able to accommodate some 5.5 million people.  We want  to\r\n\r\nhave a population of 5.5 million in 2040, but our people  are\r\n\r\nsimply  not  giving birth to enough babies to  make  up  this\r\n\r\nnumber.   Then, perhaps some 30% of the population will  have\r\n\r\nto  be foreign immigrants and  not descendants of our present\r\n\r\npopulation.   This will result in great changes to our social\r\n\r\nstructure.   Now  we  are talking about how  to  enhance  our\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesiveness, how to preserve our roots  and  how  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  our traditions and social values.  If  we  have  to\r\n\r\ndepend  on  the large inflow of immigrants and  their  number\r\n\r\nbecome  significant in our society, then all these values  we\r\n\r\ntalk about will, therefore, no longer be relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, the political scene at that time may\r\n\r\nbe quite different from what\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  may imagine it to be.  This is a very serious problem. We\r\n\r\nhave to resolve the matter and find thorough solutions to the\r\n\r\nproblem  before it becomes worse.  This is not a new problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that before the measures taken could have been\r\n\r\neffectively  solved, the problem happened in  the  past,  new\r\n\r\nproblems  have emerged and resulted in the awkward  situation\r\n\r\nthat we are now in.  In the past, we gave a lot of incentives\r\n\r\nto  encourage our people to have more babies.   We  gave  tax\r\n\r\nconcessions, priority for  HDB flats, longer maternity leave,\r\n\r\netc.   But  these  measures were unable to reap  the  desired\r\n\r\nresults.  Come to think of it, if we had not done all  these,\r\n\r\nthe situation could well be worse now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, this problem should not be left solely to\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Community Development to solve. It has to  be\r\n\r\nresolved by a high-level Inter-Ministerial Committee. This is\r\n\r\na  very  complicated matter because every individual  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety has his or her own problems. The needs are different,\r\n\r\nthe aspirations in life are different.  We have to resolve it\r\n\r\naccording to their needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would classify the reasons for people not having more\r\n\r\nchildren into the following six categories:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Can give birth and willing to give birth, but no\r\n\r\nopportunity to give birth -  non-marriage;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Willing to give birth but cannot give birth - infertile;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can give birth, but unwilling to give birth - unwilling;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Can give birth and willing to give birth, but\r\n\r\nunwilling  to  give birth early in life - unwilling  to  give\r\n\r\nbirth early;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Can give birth, willing to give birth but unwilling\r\n\r\nto have many children -  limited birth; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Can give birth, willing to give birth, and willing\r\n\r\nto have more children but received no encouragement - refused\r\n\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no simple solution to all these problems. For\r\n\r\nthose  who would like to have children, they may not be  able\r\n\r\nto give birth. Some of them do not want to get married.  Some\r\n\r\nwant  to  get  married but do not have the opportunity.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  one  well-known local columnist  mentioned  in  her\r\n\r\ncolumn  that she could have lost her chance in life.  In  the\r\n\r\npast,  we  had  the SDU, the community centres and  even  the\r\n\r\nuniversities  trying  ways and means to create  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  young  people to be paired up, to develop  a  courtship,\r\n\r\nwith  the  hope of leading to marriage. But the results  have\r\n\r\nnot  been encouraging.  Among  those who are 40 years old and\r\n\r\nabove,  16% are not married.  This is a high figure.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nin the past we had not done enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, we have to redouble our efforts and the\r\n\r\nMinistry   has  to  spend  more  money  and   organise   more\r\n\r\nactivities.   The Ministry of Education has to  work  on  the\r\n\r\nschool  children.  As for cases of infertility, we  have  now\r\n\r\nall  sorts  of   scientific methods, such  as  the  test-tube\r\n\r\nbabies  and  surrogate mothers, etc. to  help  the  infertile\r\n\r\ncouples.   However,   notwithstanding  all   these   advanced\r\n\r\ntechnologies,  the cost is still exorbitant. Only  those  who\r\n\r\nare  from  the  well-to-do families can afford such  methods.\r\n\r\nThis  is a very important problem. The Government should  see\r\n\r\nhow  it can help to cut cost or subsidise the needy, so  that\r\n\r\neven  ordinary  citizens can avail themselves  of  all  these\r\n\r\nmedical  technologies to give birth to  their  own  children.\r\n\r\nFor  those  who  are  willing to have children  but  are  not\r\n\r\nprepared  to have them at a young age, some do not  have  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  to  be  father and mother, they  need  plenty  of\r\n\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Low, you have exceeded your time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Let me conclude.\r\n\r\nGenerally  speaking, this is a matter which has to  be  taken\r\n\r\nbeyond  MCD.   It  has to be done through  an  inter-ministry\r\n\r\neffort. This is not for just one Ministry to tackle.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will set up an Inter-Ministry  Committee  to\r\n\r\nthoroughly resolve this matter\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Claire Chiang, you can speak now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Thank\r\n\r\nyou, Sir, for the opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take my first cut on restoring family ties. In\r\n\r\nour   efforts  to  globalise  in  a  pace  that  results   in\r\n\r\nfragmentation  of the self and family ties,  the  family  has\r\n\r\nbecome  an  endangered institution because of  the  pressures\r\n\r\nwhich  are building up from within and without.  These issues\r\n\r\nconcern me because the weakening of the family ties erodes  a\r\n\r\nfundamental capability - our ability to mobilise  our  people\r\n\r\nand enterprises to upkeep our national resilience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me, Sir, to give a quick snapshot on some trends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Marriages are not the norm. Statistics show that\r\n\r\nbetter  qualified females are more likely to  be  single  and\r\n\r\nsingle males too are on the rise.  Something is happening  at\r\n\r\nthe dating phase between boys and girls which need our honest\r\n\r\ntackling of gender relationships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The average family size is getting smaller from 4.7\r\n\r\nin  1980 to four in 1995 because young couples prefer to  set\r\n\r\nup  homes  away  from  their parents  and  are  having  fewer\r\n\r\nchildren.  What  this  means is we have lost  the  \"extended\"\r\n\r\nfamily ties to support the needs of working couples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The number of divorces registered under the Women's\r\n\r\nCharter  among non-Muslim couples increased 14% between  1997\r\n\r\nand  1998, the Muslim divorces increased  in the same  period\r\n\r\nby  21%.   What  we are saying is that in 1998 we  had  5,651\r\n\r\ndivorces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Family violence was another cause for divorces,\r\n\r\nincreasing  from  978  in 1995 to  2,000  in  1997.   It  was\r\n\r\nforecasted  that by end of 1998, there were 2,600  complaints\r\n\r\nbeing filed.  Some cursory observations also noted that older\r\n\r\npersons  were divorcing due to mainly incompatibility.   What\r\n\r\nthis  all means is the rise of single family households  with\r\n\r\nwomen looking after the needs of children on their own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) With more parents working, children who were\r\n\r\nunsupervised easily fell prey to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbad  company.  We saw the rise in juvenile delinquency  among\r\n\r\nthose  aged between 7 and 15 years old by 14.5%.  Of the  495\r\n\r\nrape  victims between 1994 and 1998, 32% were between 10  and\r\n\r\n14  years  old.   Parents  were often  shocked  to  find  out\r\n\r\nafterwards what their children had been up to, indicating the\r\n\r\nloss of communication and proper supervision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The Singapore population is aging. We have\r\n\r\nhighlighted  in  this  House  the  real  problems  of   their\r\n\r\nemployability   and   declining  healthcare   compounded   by\r\n\r\ninadequate  savings  and  social  isolation.   Worse   still,\r\n\r\nchildren  are  caring  less of their parents.   The  Minister\r\n\r\nhighlighted in a written reply that more than half  of  those\r\n\r\nordered to pay maintenance to their aged parents defaulted on\r\n\r\npayments  last  year.   In  some families,  parents  took  up\r\n\r\nenforcement proceedings against their children, resulting  in\r\n\r\nsentencing them to a term of imprisonment.\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this is a small number. It nevertheless\r\n\r\npoints  to  an  increasing pressure felt by the children  who\r\n\r\ncannot  afford to meet the needs of parents.   Of  the  total\r\n\r\nnumber of calls in CDCs National Helpline for 1999, close  to\r\n\r\n60%  were  training  enquiries, job  matching  and  financial\r\n\r\nassistance, including help with school fees, indicating  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  were  facing real pressures of  employment  and\r\n\r\nfinancial insecurity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are finding difficulty in forming family ties\r\n\r\nand  once  formed, we are seeing faultlines  at  all  levels,\r\n\r\nbetween   spouses,  between  parents  and  children,  between\r\n\r\nelderly  parents  and  mature children.   We  also  see  more\r\n\r\nhouseholds  consisting of siblings, grandparents,  aunts  and\r\n\r\nuncles  who offer invaluable support to strengthening  family\r\n\r\nties.   In  particular, the singles are the ones who continue\r\n\r\nto  care for the old and the young.  In changing times,  with\r\n\r\nincreasing pressures, family ties will be forged by different\r\n\r\ncomponents  within the clan, creating a new understanding  of\r\n\r\n\"extended family\" which must be respected and provided for.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all these permutations, the family cannot\r\n\r\nreach  its  goals to make Singapore our Best Home by  itself.\r\n\r\nIt needs many helping hands from the social service sector as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the  public  and  private  sectors,  that  is   the\r\n\r\n\"community, infrastructure\" to restore the \"hardware\"  within\r\n\r\nthe family members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restoring family ties no longer can be the sole\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  MCD,  because  as  every  Ministry  fixes\r\n\r\npolicies  on  taxes,  work arrangement, housing,  healthcare,\r\n\r\ntransportation and education, their decisions impact  on  the\r\n\r\nresources  of  family.  The more resources we can  pour  into\r\n\r\norganising these areas, in line with what Dr Jennifer Lee and\r\n\r\nmany  Members of the House had passionately put  across,  the\r\n\r\nbetter we are in restoring family ties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will not delay in visibly putting\r\n\r\nthis  important  agenda on the family  at  the  forefront  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  development.   Whether  you  set  up  an  Inter-Ministerial  Committee on Family, or whether it should  be  a\r\n\r\nFamily  21, which I raised in last year's Budget debate,  let\r\n\r\nthere be a mechanism set up for deliberation and consultation\r\n\r\non family policies.  Family care may not configure in our GDP\r\n\r\ncalculations  and the return on investment in this  area  may\r\n\r\nnot  be as tangible as the financial sector, but a commitment\r\n\r\nto  restoring family ties is providing Singapore  families  a\r\n\r\nstronger  rudder to control its direction of travel  in  ever\r\n\r\nrougher waters ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I would desire several small Inter-Ministerial committees which are issue-specific instead of\r\n\r\none  large  and  formal one, which often lacks  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nprocesses and intimacy that encourage free-flowing  of  ideas\r\n\r\nand  exchanges.   I  look forward towards a  mechanism  which\r\n\r\nincludes  representations from the  people  sector,  parents,\r\n\r\nsocial  workers,  educators,  human  resource  officers   and\r\n\r\nvolunteers, so that we really make the strengthening  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily the business of the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I proceed to my second cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Thank you. I will do my\r\n\r\ncut on parent care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have to indicate a crisis which the family is\r\n\r\nfacing  at  this point, I will say it is our parenting  role.\r\n\r\nSir,  parents  are  a special category of  people  who  needs\r\n\r\nfocused  attention,  the  same  way  we  focus  on  children,\r\n\r\nstudents,  elderly, entrepreneurs, and so  on.   Parents  and\r\n\r\nchildren are pulled by social forces between the pressure  of\r\n\r\nwork,  school work, friends and entertainment which  resulted\r\n\r\nin them spending less time as family.  Having time to parent,\r\n\r\nknowing  how  to parent and willing to parent  and  co-parent\r\n\r\nbetween  husbands and wives are all significant issues  which\r\n\r\nrequire  our  deep  reflection to restore  parenting  as  the\r\n\r\ncornerstone of family development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permit me, Sir, to chart a wish list by parents in\r\n\r\ndifferent  stages of development so that policy  makers  with\r\n\r\nthe  help of CDCs and VWOs can plan their outreach programmes\r\n\r\nwith a more focused strategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parent with children from 0-6 years old looks for\r\n\r\nchildcare facilities and good pre-school education to provide\r\n\r\nthe  foundation years for the child's growth.   It  does  not\r\n\r\nmatter  whether the parent is working or not, the search  for\r\n\r\ngood instruction to maximise children's total development  is\r\n\r\na strong desire in all parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parent with children from 7-12 years is obsessed by\r\n\r\nmaking sure that their children pass examinations well.   One\r\n\r\nof   the  best  attended  seminars  in  Singapore  are  those\r\n\r\norganised  on \"How to raise a successful child?\" or  \"How  to\r\n\r\nincrease your child's IQ?\"  This pressure to perform well has\r\n\r\nresulted  in  hot-housing  which stresses  both  parents  and\r\n\r\nchildren.    What  this  portends  for  the  development   of\r\n\r\ncreativity which requires a free-will spirit is something  to\r\n\r\nthink   about.   Parents  want  to  learn  how   to   balance\r\n\r\nexpectations and capabilities without destroying the  natural\r\n\r\ninclinations of the child.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parent with children 13-16 years old looks for\r\n\r\ninstructions on how to discipline and teach his children good\r\n\r\nvalues, how\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  transmit  life  skills  and  communicate  about  boy-girl\r\n\r\nrelationships.  This is the most critical and difficult phase\r\n\r\nof  parenting, yet this is one area that many parents do  not\r\n\r\nknow  how  to  take  charge because they lack  the  know-how,\r\n\r\nresources  and time.  As most children lack the communication\r\n\r\nskills  to express the conflicts and anger in them, they  act\r\n\r\nout  by shutting themselves out, or sometimes in defiant ways\r\n\r\nlike  joining  street gangs and indulging  in  all  sorts  of\r\n\r\nundesirable  behaviour.  Parents want to  learn  how  to  re-connect  and  communicate with their teens and  their  peers.\r\n\r\nParental   re-education  and  retraining  becomes   just   as\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parent with growing teens from 17 to 20 is most\r\n\r\nconcerned with making sure that his children do not mix  with\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  crowd.  This is a real dilemma.  Given  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat   many  households  are  double  income  families,  with\r\n\r\nhusbands  and wives working long hours with little  rest  and\r\n\r\nenergy  left to mend and repair the home front, children  are\r\n\r\nhence  left  to TV and friends to shape their growing  years.\r\n\r\nParents  wish  to learn how to spend quality  time  with  the\r\n\r\nfamily  and  more  tips about how to stay \"cool\"  with  their\r\n\r\ngrowing teens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably, by the age of 21, the role of parent is less\r\n\r\ncustodial  and  protective because by this  time,  the  child\r\n\r\nshould have some cognitive and emotional fundamentals to take\r\n\r\non life independently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need good programmes for parenting education.\r\n\r\nNo one can assume that parents know how to parent.  They must\r\n\r\nbe  given  the  tools,  skills and  encouragement  to  attend\r\n\r\nseminars,  to  share  and  hear  how  other  people  cope  at\r\n\r\ndifferent   stages  of  family  development.    The   serious\r\n\r\nchallenge  to all this is:  how do we get these  parents  who\r\n\r\nmost  need the programmes to come forward in the first place?\r\n\r\nHow  do we change their mindsets about parenting and ask them\r\n\r\nto  look at this responsibility seriously.  Sir, I will start\r\n\r\nby encouraging every company in Singapore to allot one hour a\r\n\r\nmonth for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuch  talks  to  be  organised for their employees.   I  look\r\n\r\ntowards MCD and the National Youth Council, as well as  CDCs,\r\n\r\nfor their leadership in prioritising parenting education as a\r\n\r\nparamount  component in family development strategy.   And  a\r\n\r\nside  point,  I  hope the Leader of the House will,  in  next\r\n\r\nyear's  Budget meetings, not schedule Budget sittings on  the\r\n\r\nweek  of the school vacation because this deprives a  lot  of\r\n\r\nparents in having this vacation with our children during  the\r\n\r\nwhole week.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, Assoc. Prof. Low\r\n\r\nSeow  Chay  who  spoke before has already  touched  upon  the\r\n\r\ndeclining  birth rate in Singapore.  I agree  with  him  that\r\n\r\nnations  that cannot reverse their declining birth  rate  are\r\n\r\neffectively committing collective suicide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Asia, Japan has the most severe challenge in this\r\n\r\nrespect  as the number of children per woman in that  country\r\n\r\nhas  dropped  to  1.38.   The  Japanese  government  recently\r\n\r\ncommissioned  a  survey  of  young  men  and  women  of   the\r\n\r\nmarriageable age group to determine the reasons.   I  thought\r\n\r\nit  would  be interesting to share some of the key  findings.\r\n\r\nOf the men surveyed, 30% considered marriage a burden, and of\r\n\r\nthis,  50% gave financial factors as reasons.  Secondly,  40%\r\n\r\nof  the women surveyed also viewed marriage as a burden,  and\r\n\r\nthe reasons given included house work, child rearing, looking\r\n\r\nafter   aged   parents-in-law  and  coping  with   the   dual\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of work and homemaking.  Asked whether  they\r\n\r\nfelt  that married couples should have children, over 20%  of\r\n\r\nthe  women between the age of 18 and 39 said \"no\".  And  this\r\n\r\nis close to twice the percentage for men.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be interesting to find out the views of\r\n\r\nyoung   Singaporeans  regarding  child  rearing  today.    In\r\n\r\nresponse  to  the  survey I mentioned earlier,  the  Japanese\r\n\r\ngovernment  is introducing some of the measures  to  help  to\r\n\r\npromote   child   rearing  support  and   they   are:     (1)\r\n\r\nestablishing  day care facilities near train stations,  which\r\n\r\nis  quite interesting, and (2) extending child allowance  for\r\n\r\nchildren from birth to pre-schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, of the various conveniences and incentives\r\n\r\nthat Members have come up with, all are remedial actions.   I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  more important to determine what is  the  root\r\n\r\ncause of declining birth rate.  We should dwell into what are\r\n\r\nthe perceptions of young men and women regarding family life.\r\n\r\nIt  must be stating the obvious, Sir, to say that the  number\r\n\r\nof  children a family would have is largely determined by the\r\n\r\nwife.  Whether a woman would like to have a large family or a\r\n\r\nsmall one depends on the values inculcated in that young lady\r\n\r\nmany  years  ago.   Presumably, those  growing  up  in  large\r\n\r\nfamilies  that  are  warm and loving  will  hopefully  prefer\r\n\r\nlarger families, and those growing up in small families  will\r\n\r\nnaturally consider small as beautiful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to use my own family as an example.\r\n\r\nGrowing  up  in Singapore, I was conditioned to believe  that\r\n\r\ntwo was the right number.  On the other hand, my wife grew up\r\n\r\nin Hawaii in an extended family   So when we married 19 years\r\n\r\nago, her ideal family was to have five children.  Reality set\r\n\r\nin  very  quickly  as  we both discovered  that  bringing  up\r\n\r\nchildren  was a very demanding process.  And the end  result,\r\n\r\nwe  ended up with four.  But the important thing is we should\r\n\r\nstart  with  a  large number and hopefully you  end  up  with\r\n\r\nsomething close to what we want to have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, Sir, the lesson learned is that it is very\r\n\r\nimportant for a man to find a wife who wants a big family  in\r\n\r\nthe  first place.  Sir, I am not asserting that we  can  draw\r\n\r\nconclusion  based on a sample size of one.   But  I  believe,\r\n\r\nunless  we  inculcate the desire for children  in  our  young\r\n\r\nwomen,  we  cannot  reverse the trend towards  our  declining\r\n\r\nbirth  rate.   Since we do not have large families  today  as\r\n\r\nrole  models,  we have no choice but to turn to the  schools.\r\n\r\nBut  I  doubt  this is a task that the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nconsiders  as  part  of its portfolio.  So  somehow  we  must\r\n\r\nchange  the  perception, especially among  the  young  women,\r\n\r\ntowards  family.  In this aspect, I think I  am  treading  on\r\n\r\nvery  thin  ice.  If we need to change the woman's perception\r\n\r\nfrom career orientation towards family orientation, and it is\r\n\r\nthe only way to reverse this trend, I think we have to do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, turning around this view will require the\r\n\r\nconcerted effort of the whole Government and not just one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  Ministries  alone.   In this respect,  I  would  support\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly  the call by Dr Jennifer  Lee,  Dr  Vasoo  and\r\n\r\nProf. Low Seow Chay to have an Inter-Ministerial Committee to\r\n\r\nwork on this very important matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We will now move into the sporting arena.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, I would like to first declare\r\n\r\nmy  interest  as the President of the Singapore Table  Tennis\r\n\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has provided a strong injection into\r\n\r\nthe  development of sports by incorporating sports  into  the\r\n\r\nCommunity   Development  Ministry.    The   National   Sports\r\n\r\nAssociations   have  embraced  this  move   as   a   positive\r\n\r\ninclination  towards Government's emphasis on the  growth  of\r\n\r\nthe sports industry in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Singapore Sports Council's Sports\r\n\r\nExcellence  programme, with a number of  assistance  schemes,\r\n\r\nprovides a basic framework and infrastructure for our  sports\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   Our  National Sports  Associations  have  been\r\n\r\ncategorised and received different amounts of subsidies  from\r\n\r\nthe  scheme.  However, this is not sufficient.  More  support\r\n\r\nshould  be  considered  for the areas  of  concern,  such  as\r\n\r\ntechnical  development  of  the  core  sports  and   a   more\r\n\r\nstructured leadership development programme for all the NSAs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key area of concern is the housing scheme for\r\n\r\nthe various NSAs.  Homes for our National Sports Associations\r\n\r\nare  important.  I hope the Government could evaluate on  the\r\n\r\nvarious  sports  housing  schemes  for  our  National  Sports\r\n\r\nAssociations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the local sports fraternity also needs human\r\n\r\ncapital.   Scholarships  and  a tailored  tertiary  education\r\n\r\nprogramme  should be considered and provided in this  respect\r\n\r\nto  assist  the  growth of the industry.   And  I  hope  more\r\n\r\nsupport would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso  be  given for the organisation of international  sports\r\n\r\nevents in Singapore, like the recent 14th Commonwealth  Table\r\n\r\nTennis Championship.  This will give Singapore a new light as\r\n\r\na  country  with  a  positive outlook  towards  international\r\n\r\nsports development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, in propelling Singapore's sports industry\r\n\r\nin   a   new   time,  injection  of  subsidies  for   housing\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   leadership  development  and   assistance   in\r\n\r\norganising  international  sports  events  for  our  National\r\n\r\nSports Associations are very crucial.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, with the expansion of the MCD to\r\n\r\ninclude sports at the Ministry level, sports finally  have  a\r\n\r\nhigher profile.  The signal is that the Government is finally\r\n\r\nserious about sports.  In 1990, the formation of MITA allowed\r\n\r\nthe  arts  to take off in Singapore.  Hopefully, we  see  the\r\n\r\nsame results in sports.\r\n\r\nBesides  Sports for All and Sports for Life, the  message  is\r\n\r\nnow  Sports  Excellence, Sports Tourism.  This will  spawn  a\r\n\r\nwhole  new sports industry with many exciting careers.   When\r\n\r\nwe  think  of  a career in sports, we probably think  of  the\r\n\r\nprofessional  athlete winning the championship, world  famous\r\n\r\ncoach, sumo wrestler or sports commentator on TV.  But  these\r\n\r\nhigh  visibility  roles are only the tip of a  business  that\r\n\r\nspawns  professional sports, sports education, amateur sports\r\n\r\nand all the services that support them.  So if a person loves\r\n\r\nsports  and wants to spend a sports career, there is probably\r\n\r\na  role that will match the passion and skills set that  will\r\n\r\nprovide  a  sports  career.  The sports industry  in  Britain\r\n\r\ngenerates  more than pound8 billion sterling in  revenue  per\r\n\r\nyear.   The  number of sports-related jobs in British  sports\r\n\r\nincreased from 10,000 in 1985 to 470,000 in 1990.  There  are\r\n\r\nliterally  thousands  of  different jobs  related  to  sports\r\n\r\nencompassing virtually every business discipline in  addition\r\n\r\nto  actual play and coaching.  The Americans spent about US$6\r\n\r\nbillion a year on spectator sports.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, until now, the main concern of parents when they\r\n\r\ndecide  whether  their children should go into  training  for\r\n\r\nsports  excellence  is whether there is a good  career  path.\r\n\r\nSportsmen  and  sportswomen themselves are  also  asking,  is\r\n\r\nthere  any  sports  career?  Even that we  want  more  sports\r\n\r\npersons.   We need to consider what is being done to  develop\r\n\r\nthe  sports career or sports persons.  What is the Ministry's\r\n\r\nplan on this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give our sports a boost and lift it to higher levels,\r\n\r\nforeign  talents would have to be imported.  While  they  can\r\n\r\nplay  a  supporting  and aspiring role with  local  athletes,\r\n\r\nchallenging  and  motivating them to excel, they  should  not\r\n\r\nreplace  our local talents.  With money, we can buy the  best\r\n\r\nsports persons and field them in our national teams.  But  we\r\n\r\nmust  ensure  that  the  foreign  talents  must  be  able  to\r\n\r\nassimilate into our Singapore society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know what strategies and programmes\r\n\r\nwould  be put in place to provide our local sports talents  a\r\n\r\ngood  sports  career. The field lives of many  career  sports\r\n\r\npersons can be limited perhaps due to injuries during play or\r\n\r\nto  ageing.  The Ministry must therefore have a comprehensive\r\n\r\nretraining programme for the career sports persons so that by\r\n\r\nthe  time  they retire from the field, they can also  have  a\r\n\r\nrewarding second career.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> In December last year, at\r\n\r\nthe  Timesport  50  Greatest Athletes'  Ceremony,  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said that the time was right for Singapore  to  seek\r\n\r\nmore  ambitious  goals in sports.  In order  to  reach  these\r\n\r\ngoals,  I  believe we need a whole array of people,  and  not\r\n\r\njust the sportsmen alone, to support this effort and build  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  infrastructure for sporting excellence.   First  and\r\n\r\nforemost, we need to identify and cultivate sporting talents.\r\n\r\nI  believe there are such talents, among our young, who  have\r\n\r\nthe  ability and inclination for sports.  However,  some  may\r\n\r\nnot  have  the ability to do well in mainstream subjects  and\r\n\r\nwho  may  drop out of school if they were to pursue  extended\r\n\r\ncurriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there is a way to allow them to pursue their\r\n\r\ntalent more effectively, that is, to set up sports schools to\r\n\r\ngive  them  a customised programme to match their  interests,\r\n\r\ncareer aspirations and abilities.  These sports schools could\r\n\r\nbe modelled after the Institute of Technical Education (ITE).\r\n\r\nIn  this case, we would be offering subjects that are related\r\n\r\nto sports and sports businesses.  Besides scheduled training,\r\n\r\nthey  could  study other subjects, such as nutrition,  sports\r\n\r\npsychology,  training  methodology  and  principles,   sports\r\n\r\nsociology,   basic   bio-mechanics  and  sports   management.\r\n\r\nStudents would also have access to facilities, equipment  and\r\n\r\ntraining that most could not otherwise afford.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such institutions could stand these students in good\r\n\r\nstead,  helping  them carve out a future as  a  sportsman  or\r\n\r\nwoman, or being a part of sports management promotion, or  as\r\n\r\nDr  Ho  mentioned  just now, as part of the sports  industry.\r\n\r\nSuch  an alternative educational offering would also dovetail\r\n\r\nnicely  into  the  Ministry  of  Education's  goal  of   mass\r\n\r\ncustomisation  to  give students a basic  education  and  yet\r\n\r\nprovide  them with teaching in other selected areas.   Sports\r\n\r\nschools  are  common  in other countries that  have  produced\r\n\r\nworld  class athletes.  Such schools are formidable, offering\r\n\r\nboarding facilities, sports experts in various subjects along\r\n\r\nwith teachers in basic curriculum.  Such schools can play  an\r\n\r\nessential  part in providing the infrastructure for  building\r\n\r\naccomplished athletes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, may I begin by stating that I am\r\n\r\nthe  President  of the Singapore Badminton Association.   The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has set goals for the nation to achieve in the\r\n\r\ninternational   competition  for  football,   badminton   and\r\n\r\nsailing.    For   Singapore  to  achieve  consistently   high\r\n\r\nstandards  in  all these sports and other core sports,  there\r\n\r\nshould   be   a  concerted  effort  to  train  the  athletes.\r\n\r\nObviously,  the  skills,  interest  and  commitment  of   the\r\n\r\nathletes  have to be inculcated from young.  The best  period\r\n\r\nis  actually when they are in schools.  However, the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education views sports as only part of its core curriculum\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to win honours for Singapore in the top league\r\n\r\ncompetition, it is necessary for the new Ministry to take  on\r\n\r\nproducing  athletes as its mission.  Today, we are  depending\r\n\r\non  chances  for  young  boys and girls  to  emerge  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  sacrifice the standard career  path  to  pursue\r\n\r\ntheir  interest in sports.  Furthermore, to do so, they  need\r\n\r\nto have the support of their parents in this area.  Given the\r\n\r\nSingapore  environment,  therefore,  producing  champions  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be a random and very rare event.  If we were to have\r\n\r\nany chance of meeting the goals set by the Prime Minister,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  we need a process, something that Mr Ong had pointed\r\n\r\nout,  to  produce a steady stream of young athletes  so  that\r\n\r\nsome  might go on to become champions.  Perhaps, the Ministry\r\n\r\nshould  take  this  on as part of its mission  for  producing\r\n\r\nsportsmen  and women who are able to stand on  their  own  in\r\n\r\ninternational competitions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way of doing so is to establish sports schools for\r\n\r\nyoung  and  budding athletes.  The sports  schools  could  be\r\n\r\nmodelled  after  those in Malaysia where  students  with  the\r\n\r\ntalents  in  sports  could focus their energy  in  developing\r\n\r\ntheir   skills   and   yet  receiving  a   quality   academic\r\n\r\nqualification  with  classes tailored around  their  training\r\n\r\nschedules.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development  will  be  renamed  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development and Sports next month. It  shows  that\r\n\r\nthe Government is very serious about sports and has long-term\r\n\r\nobjectives to attain good results in the sports arena.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now competing in the Asian level. The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  set his goal for our national soccer  team  to\r\n\r\nfight  for a place in the World Cup tournament proper by  the\r\n\r\nyear  2008.  In other sports, we have also set certain goals.\r\n\r\nFor the attainment of these goals, I have some suggestions to\r\n\r\nmake.  First,  we  must set up a sports  training  school  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  For the arts, we have the Nanyang Academy of Fine\r\n\r\nArts. For sports, we should have an Academy of Sports.  While\r\n\r\nwe have upgrading for our HDB flats, and even\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprivate housing estates, we should also have plans to upgrade\r\n\r\nour National Stadium and Indoor Stadium and develop them into\r\n\r\na  centre  for sports training and competition, or  a  sports\r\n\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have facilities to house our sportsmen and\r\n\r\nsportswomen  so that they can train in an in-camp environment\r\n\r\nto have better concentration to undergo more focused training\r\n\r\nin  order to improve their performance and go all out to  win\r\n\r\nmedals for Singapore in international competitions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must also set up scholarship schemes for\r\n\r\nour   talented  sportsmen  and  sportswomen  who   have   the\r\n\r\naspiration to be world-beaters. The Government has all  along\r\n\r\nbeen  giving  scholarships to students who excel in  academic\r\n\r\nstudies.  I  think it is time for the Government to  consider\r\n\r\ngiving  sports scholarships to encourage our young people  to\r\n\r\ncontribute in the field of sports.  These  scholarships would\r\n\r\nenable them to go overseas for professional training.  I read\r\n\r\nin  the  newspapers about our crop of young  talents  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious sports such as martial arts, bowling, swimming, table-tennis,  etc.   There  is  no  lack  of  sports  talents   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We should identify them from young and give  them\r\n\r\nthe  much-needed encouragement and incentives in the form  of\r\n\r\nsports scholarships.   We know that horses can run.  But  not\r\n\r\nall horses can run well all by themselves. They need training\r\n\r\nto turn into top race-horses. We must devote our resources to\r\n\r\nencourage  and  train our sportsmen so that  they  have  good\r\n\r\ntraining  facilities, good coaches and  good  environment  to\r\n\r\nbring out their best performance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we must ensure that there will be a career for\r\n\r\nour  sportsmen.  We note that our youths, and their  parents,\r\n\r\nare  not  very keen to take up competitive sports  seriously,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  worry about their future.   While  young  they\r\n\r\ncould  be  very good and could put in some good performances.\r\n\r\nBut what happens after they have passed their prime? There is\r\n\r\nno safeguard in their career.  For example,  we have Chen\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nYeow  Chuan and Ong Chin Hai who excelled in the martial arts\r\n\r\nand  won  medals for Singapore in international competitions.\r\n\r\nThey  were  spotted by TCS and were offered a  career  as  TV\r\n\r\nactors.   For  their future, they have to make  acting  their\r\n\r\ncareer,  rather than staying on as sportsmen.  They  are  the\r\n\r\nlucky  ones.  At least they can still practise their  martial\r\n\r\narts.  But there are many other sportsmen and sportswomen who\r\n\r\nsimply faded out of the sports scene in order to pursue other\r\n\r\ncareers as a means to earn a living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel the Government should do something to provide\r\n\r\nsome  safeguard  for the sports people by  guaranteeing  them\r\n\r\nsome  form of job security.  We should help to map  out  some\r\n\r\nkind of career path for them so that they will have the peace\r\n\r\nof  mind to concentrate on their sports training to bring out\r\n\r\nthe best in them and win medals for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we must have sufficient budget for all the\r\n\r\nsports  associations.  Many of our sports  associations  have\r\n\r\nfunding  problems  and  they seem to be  spending  more  time\r\n\r\ntrying  to  raise  funds  than to  promote  sports.   Council\r\n\r\nmembers  in  the  sports associations spend  a  lot  of  time\r\n\r\norganising  all sorts of events to raise funds, year  in  and\r\n\r\nyear  out.  They have simply no time to develop their  sports\r\n\r\nand  their  associations.  I hope MCDS  can  consider  giving\r\n\r\nthese  sports  associations 1  to  2,  or  1  to  3  matching\r\n\r\nsubsidies,  like  it  is  done for the Community  Development\r\n\r\nCouncils.    This way, the sports association will have  more\r\n\r\ntime  and  resources  to help our sportsmen  and  sportswomen\r\n\r\ndevelop  their  potentials to the fullest,  and  hence  bring\r\n\r\nglory to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Kenneth Chen is not here. Mr Ong Kian\r\n\r\nMin.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> In promoting sports, I believe that\r\n\r\nthere  is  one  more sport in which Singaporeans  can  attain\r\n\r\ninternational standing, that is, the sport of figure skating.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  can do well in figure skating for two  reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst,  we  can  skate  on ice indoors all  the  year  round.\r\n\r\nWhile  it  may be too hot and humid to play football outdoors\r\n\r\nin the sun, at noon, it is not a problem to practise and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrain  on  the ice skating rink indoors throughout the  whole\r\n\r\nday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also do not need winter to have a frozen surface of\r\n\r\nice.   Unlike  skiing, when you need a mountain covered  with\r\n\r\nsnow,  you do not need a frozen lake to ice skate.   Whatever\r\n\r\nthe  temperature is outside, ice can be man-made by  machine,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  rain  or shine, hot or cold,  night  or  day\r\n\r\noutside. We can ice-skate indoors any time of the day.\r\n\r\n<br>6.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, figure ice-skating does not require a strong\r\n\r\nphysique.   In sports like athletics, swimming or basketball,\r\n\r\na  tall or well-built person has a distinct advantage but  in\r\n\r\ncompetitive  figure  ice-skating  where  both  artistry   and\r\n\r\nathleticism   are  required,  a  small   built   is   not   a\r\n\r\ndisadvantage.  In fact, there are examples where  ice-skaters\r\n\r\nhave  overcome their own physical disadvantages and  excelled\r\n\r\nin  the  sport.  These examples can be an inspiration to  our\r\n\r\nyoung, whether they are budding sportsmen or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott Hamilton is a four-time world and gold medal\r\n\r\nOlympic figure skating champion. He was a normal healthy  kid\r\n\r\nuntil  he mysteriously stopped growing when he was five years\r\n\r\nold.  The doctors never knew what was wrong with him. He just\r\n\r\nhad  no physical development at all. For four years, his body\r\n\r\nwas unable to absorb virtually any nutrition from the food he\r\n\r\nate.  For four years, he thought he would never grow  another\r\n\r\ninch.   One day, he tried figure ice-skating and said, and  I\r\n\r\nquote,  \"It  was the one thing that I could do  on  an  equal\r\n\r\nbasis with the other kids.\"  After taking up the sport, Scott\r\n\r\nregained  his health and had grown some more.  All  signs  of\r\n\r\nhis  illness  had  disappeared. Some  attributed  it  to  the\r\n\r\nvigorous exercise of ice-skating. He never grew taller than 5\r\n\r\nfeet  31/2  inches but he certainly stands tall on  the  ice.\r\n\r\nAnother  example  is  Kristi  Yamaguchi,  an  American   born\r\n\r\nJapanese, who herself overcame her small stature and a turned-in  foot  condition  to become an Olympic gold  medallist  in\r\n\r\n1992.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, beyond the competitive level, ice-skating can also\r\n\r\nprovide viable career\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  ice-skaters.  If Singaporean  ice-skaters\r\n\r\ncan  excel,  they  can even be full-time professional  figure\r\n\r\nskaters.   One example is the Disney World on Ice,  which  is\r\n\r\ncurrently  performing  in our Indoor Stadium  at  this  time.\r\n\r\nSkaters  could  also  end up as coaches  to  teach  the  next\r\n\r\ngeneration of young students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to promote and encourage ice-skating among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, I would like to suggest two things we  can  do.\r\n\r\nThe first is to put in place the infrastructure by building a\r\n\r\nworld-class  ice-skating rink. Kuala Lumpur has a  number  of\r\n\r\ninternational standard ice-skating rinks which  have  allowed\r\n\r\nthe  staging  of several regional competitions and  attracted\r\n\r\ngood international participation and coverage. The second  is\r\n\r\nfor the Ministry of Education to accept ice-skating as a core\r\n\r\ncurricular activity and to encourage students to take it  up.\r\n\r\nIn  spite  of  our physical limits, I believe that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncould  very  well  produce future champions  in  ice-skating.\r\n\r\nGiven proper support, I believe that figure ice-skating  will\r\n\r\nbe  one  of the sports in which our athletes will  shine.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the Ministry will support this sport and pave  the  way\r\n\r\nfor aspiring skaters to succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to make some\r\n\r\npoints relating to MCD.  Each year, I have urged the Minister\r\n\r\nto  try and see what he can do more for the voluntary welfare\r\n\r\norganisations and I would like to remind him this year  again\r\n\r\nthat   the   subventions   provided  to   voluntary   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations are not as attractive as it should be.  I  know\r\n\r\nhis  hands are tied but I will try and help him to  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance.  I am sure that Members here will  join\r\n\r\nme  to  urge the Ministry of Finance to find ways to allocate\r\n\r\nmore  funds  to  the people sector.  As I have said  earlier,\r\n\r\nthis is very important because the people sector too requires\r\n\r\nmore support in order to build a healthier community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, I see that $42.8 million has been allocated\r\n\r\nas  subvention  grant to the voluntary welfare organisations.\r\n\r\nThis  is,  to my mind, indeed too small.  I feel that  a  bit\r\n\r\nmore could be given so that the voluntary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsector  will  be  more viable and will be  able  to  take  on\r\n\r\nadditional  responsibilities. This is one of the missions  of\r\n\r\nMCD  and  the Government to encourage more helping hands.  In\r\n\r\norder  for  them to participate in more self-help programmes,\r\n\r\nit  is  essentially necessary to find ways  to  increase  the\r\n\r\nsubventions to voluntary welfare organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the dollar-to-dollar contribution which is\r\n\r\nbeing given at the moment to programmes could be reviewed.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that a 60:40 formula be considered so that the burden\r\n\r\nof  fund-raising by the voluntary welfare organisations could\r\n\r\nbe reduced. The volunteers could therefore be able to look at\r\n\r\nhow   they  could  extend  their  programmes  and  find   new\r\n\r\nstrategies to address the challenges which many Members  have\r\n\r\nbrought  up  relating to families, population decline,  young\r\n\r\npersons,  family conflicts and other related problems.  These\r\n\r\nare  issues which are very complex and therefore if you  want\r\n\r\nthe  voluntary sector to be more involved, I would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to re-look at the funding formula which will provide\r\n\r\na  new  headstart  for the organisations to  be  involved  in\r\n\r\npromoting more self-help in the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I support the appeal\r\n\r\nby  Dr  Vasoo.  We  should give more help  to  the  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations, because feedback from many  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare   organisations  indicate   that   it   is   becoming\r\n\r\nincreasingly  difficult for them to raise  funds  to  finance\r\n\r\ntheir  activities and projects.  Based on the report  on  the\r\n\r\nInter-Ministerial Committee on Healthcare  for  the  Elderly,\r\n\r\nthe  VWOs are encouraged to continue providing long-term care\r\n\r\nservices  at  community  hospitals, chronic  sick  hospitals,\r\n\r\nnursing  homes, day-care centres and in the elderly  people's\r\n\r\nown  homes.   In view of the increasing needs  of  an  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation, VWOs are needed to provide more such services  to\r\n\r\naccommodate the increase in demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only are more VWOs needed, the services that they\r\n\r\nprovide must also be of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhigh  quality.   To ensure that the care they provide  is  of\r\n\r\ngood  quality, the VWOs are expected to actively explore  and\r\n\r\nimplement  various assistance programmes to help  to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  process and outcome of care for the elderly.   To  carry\r\n\r\nout these programmes, much time and efforts are required from\r\n\r\nthem. This leaves them with little time to raise funds to run\r\n\r\nthe services.  In order to ease the burden of the VWOs and to\r\n\r\nencourage more VWOs to provide services for the elderly,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should provide more funding to  them,  even  more\r\n\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, perhaps the Government would like to\r\n\r\nconsider  reviewing the current funding principles of  up  to\r\n\r\n90%  for  capital expenditure and up to 50% of the  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure  or the VWOs' deficit, whichever is lower.   This\r\n\r\nwould help to reduce the burden of fund-raising for the  VWOs\r\n\r\nto enable them to concentrate on their core activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I echo the call by Dr\r\n\r\nVasoo  and Mr Ong for more funding for the VWOs. May  I  just\r\n\r\nuse  one  case study as a concrete example to show  what  are\r\n\r\nsome  of  the difficulties faced by the VWOs in the  area  of\r\n\r\nfunding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me use the example of Bukit Ho Swee Social Service\r\n\r\nCentre.  It was in existence since 1969 and in their 30 years\r\n\r\nof  service, they have taken up the challenge of establishing\r\n\r\nseparate facilities for the family and youth services.   They\r\n\r\nwanted  to  appeal for more funds to start up another  family\r\n\r\nservice  centre  to cater to expanding needs and  more  youth\r\n\r\nactivities.  The  move  for them was  not  an  expansion  for\r\n\r\nexpansion  sake,  but  was  a much needed  response  to  curb\r\n\r\njuvenile delinquency and to increase family functioning among\r\n\r\nthe  disadvantaged low-income community.  In my view, I  know\r\n\r\nthat  it was a very good initiative, especially when  we  are\r\n\r\naware  and  from what I said earlier, that teenage crime  has\r\n\r\nbeen  on  the rise since 1990. Street corner gang  activities\r\n\r\nwere  widespread and if this phenomenon is not arrested, many\r\n\r\nyoung people would either be victims of senseless violence or\r\n\r\nended up in penal institutions.  These youths come from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmultiple-problem  families and they  need  various  kinds  of\r\n\r\nmethods to reach them.  Because they are trapped in a culture\r\n\r\nof  poverty  and  delinquency, their needs  are  varied.  The\r\n\r\nactivities and the plan will have to be of a wide  range  and\r\n\r\nthe  attention  given to them is intense and  extensive,  but\r\n\r\nresources are scarce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group had appealed for funding but the Ministry has\r\n\r\ndeclined. My question is: what criteria should be used by the\r\n\r\nMinistry to fund or not to fund? What sort of guidelines have\r\n\r\nbeen drawn up to identify the continuum of social services to\r\n\r\nmeet  the range of needs faced by young people, dysfunctional\r\n\r\nfamilies, disadvantaged families and the rest of it?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also urge the Ministry then to review the\r\n\r\nfunding principles.  The 90:10 formula in capital funding  is\r\n\r\na  good one because it is co-sharing of responsibilities. But\r\n\r\ncould  the Ministry not review the 50:50 percentage operating\r\n\r\nfunding  instead and amend it to 70:30 or even 80:20 so  that\r\n\r\nVWOs  are  less stressed by having to seek for funds  to  run\r\n\r\ntheir operations?  Because their job is really to service the\r\n\r\nclients,  to look at therapy programmes and to reach  out  to\r\n\r\nall  the  disadvantaged families. Their job is not  to  raise\r\n\r\nfunds.  If the Ministry could\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nre-consider these principles, it would be very helpful.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think it will become a bit disorderly\r\n\r\nif  we move into Community Development Councils and since  we\r\n\r\nhave  gained  some time today, as a matter of  bonus  to  the\r\n\r\nDefence  people, we can stop here.
