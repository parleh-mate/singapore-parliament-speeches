Therefore,  our  Party  Chairman's\r\n\r\namendment will show clearly who is real and  who\r\n\r\nis  false:  who  is true and who is  untrue.  In\r\n\r\nfact, although they talk about merger, it is not\r\n\r\na real merger. They are cheating the people. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  the  amendment  moved  by  our   Party\r\n\r\nChairman  is truly in accordance with the  hopes\r\n\r\nand  aspirations of the people. Here, we can see\r\n\r\nhow the workers, farmers and people in all walks\r\n\r\nof  life in Singapore react against the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nmerger. All the people have raised their  points\r\n\r\nof  view, but the leadership in the P.A.P. still\r\n\r\nrefuse  to  listen  to the people  and  secretly\r\n\r\ncarry  on  their act of selling out the  people.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, the people are very realistic about\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  That  has  made  the  P.A.P. talk\r\n\r\nambiguously.  Their aim has been disclosed  very\r\n\r\ngradually. Our Chairman, by using simple  terms,\r\n\r\nhas very clearly and systematically explained to\r\n\r\nthe  people our opinions. No matter how eloquent\r\n\r\nthey  are,  they still cannot speak against  us.\r\n\r\nThey  cannot  defeat us verbally.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nfrom  the debate of the past few days, no wonder\r\n\r\npeople  at large have all stated that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nnow and the P.A.P. of former days are different.\r\n\r\nThis  is  really true. The people at  large  are\r\n\r\nright. They are 100 per cent correct. We can see\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth   and  the  Minister  for  Labour  making\r\n\r\neloquent speeches to try and deceive the people.\r\n\r\nThey  use  all  sorts of means to achieve  their\r\n\r\naims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I want to quote the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill's speech. In the second day\r\n\r\nof  his  speech, he denied what he said  on  the\r\n\r\nfirst  day.  He said that he was not opposed  to\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis'  motion,  but  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  had  special  motives.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  his  speech  appeared   to   be\r\n\r\nrational.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is apparently a real one. After\r\n\r\nanalysis, we can have a more rational  approach\r\n\r\nand  we can express the people's views. We hope\r\n\r\nthat   everyone  will  think  of  the  people's\r\n\r\ninterests  and  try to attain the reunification\r\n\r\nand  merger  of Singapore with the  Federation,\r\n\r\nbut  not  by  false expressions to deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Only by this will the people's  wishes\r\n\r\nbe expressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the sincerity shown by our\r\n\r\nParty  Chairman  in his speech is  now  wasted.\r\n\r\nFrom  the  speech of the leader of the  S.P.A.,\r\n\r\nyou  can  see  that  we  are  sincere.  We  are\r\n\r\nfighting  hard  so that our citizenship  rights\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  sold  out. If  the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore cannot automatically become  citizens\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation, then  it  is  not  a  real\r\n\r\nmerger.  In this respect, the S.P.A. are  more\r\n\r\nhonest  and more frank than the P.A.P. leaders.\r\n\r\nBut  they are opportunistic because, on the one\r\n\r\nhand, they support the P.A.P. and, on the other\r\n\r\nhand, they attack the P.A.P. This contradictory\r\n\r\nattitude  is  laughable.  The  general   masses\r\n\r\nalready  know  their  true  colours.  But   the\r\n\r\nleaders of the P.A.P. are more dishonest.  They\r\n\r\ncontinue with their sophisticated arguments and\r\n\r\nthey  can  only repeat what the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nsaid  that  from  1954  to  1959  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nforces united together to fight the British. In\r\n\r\nthose  days, the P.A.P. saw fit to  unite  with\r\n\r\nall  nationalists - even with the  Communists - and\r\n\r\nall  other anti-colonial forces. They said that\r\n\r\nit  was  a  three-cornered  fight  amongst  the\r\n\r\nnationalists, Communists and the P.A.P. at that\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what we are talking about\r\n\r\ntoday  is  whether we are to have a true  or  a\r\n\r\nphoney  merger. The question is whether we  are\r\n\r\nto  agree to the proposed merger of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  which  is for the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, or whether we are to agree\r\n\r\nto  the P.A.P. phoney merger, which is to  sell\r\n\r\nout the interests of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance talked at length\r\n\r\nabout Communism. His purpose was to confuse the\r\n\r\nvision  of the people from the issue of whether\r\n\r\nit is a true or\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nphoney  merger and to direct their attention  to\r\n\r\nthe problem of Communism. He was actually trying\r\n\r\nto  throw  a  red herring across the path.  From\r\n\r\nthis  we  can  clearly see that the  P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nbankrupt  in  ideas. They do not  have  any  new\r\n\r\nmaterial to offer. All that they can do is  just\r\n\r\nto  go on talking. From our experience with  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists,  we  should  fight  against   this\r\n\r\noppression. We should fight for true  democratic\r\n\r\nrights and for the improvement of the livelihood\r\n\r\nof  the  people. All this is in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe  desires and wishes of the people. It is not\r\n\r\na  question  whether Singapore  is  a  Communist\r\n\r\nState  or not. My purpose in joining the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis is to fight for the materialisation  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy and for a more just and\r\n\r\nreasonable society in order to improve  the  lot\r\n\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has also said that\r\n\r\nnow  the  nationalists have  to  part  with  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  that there should  be  a  clear\r\n\r\ndemarcation between them. Do the P.A.P. profess\r\n\r\nthemselves to be so-called nationalists? If this\r\n\r\nis  what the Minister for Finance means, then  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  people will reject  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nreasoning. Since the P.A.P. came into power, the\r\n\r\npeople   of   Singapore  can  see  through   the\r\n\r\nintrigues  of  the P.A.P. in putting  forward  a\r\n\r\nphoney  merger  which is intended  to  sell  out\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This is the common  talk  at  street\r\n\r\ncorners.  The people say that the Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment sold Christmas Island, but the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  wants to sell Singapore! Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nadvise  the  leadership of  the  P.A.P. not  to\r\n\r\ndisgrace the good name of the nationalists.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are  not  qualified to  call  themselves\r\n\r\nnationalists. The Deputy Prime Minister has said\r\n\r\nthat there are only a few hundred Communists  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Why should the citizenship rights  of\r\n\r\nthousands of people in Singapore be deprived for\r\n\r\nthe sake of a few hundred Communists?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to touch on what the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health and Law said. He stated that\r\n\r\nthe  automatic conversion of Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\ninto Federation citizens on Merger Day will  not\r\n\r\nbe acceptable to the Federation Government. This\r\n\r\nis quite honest,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbut  this  also goes to explain one point.  The\r\n\r\nway in which the P.A.P. leadership are behaving\r\n\r\nis  very shameful. They want to monopolise  the\r\n\r\nwhole  thing.  If  they cannot  monopolise  the\r\n\r\nwhole  thing, they do not want to do  anything.\r\n\r\nThey   should  tell  the  people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nfrankly  what  they intend to do.  They  should\r\n\r\nseek strength from all classes of the people to\r\n\r\npersuade the Tunku that if that sort of negotia\r\n\r\ntion  is not agreeable in the interests of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, then the terms of such  a\r\n\r\nmerger should not be accepted. We can fight for\r\n\r\nour   constitutional  advancement  by  pursuing\r\n\r\nanother method. This would have saved a lot  of\r\n\r\ntime of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nand  Law clearly recognises our stand on merger\r\n\r\nand thinks that it is a correct stand, then  he\r\n\r\nshould  not waste time arguing about it unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us go on to what the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture said. He could only  talk\r\n\r\nabout  this  and that. He spoke  at  random  on\r\n\r\nthings  which were entirely irrelevant  to  the\r\n\r\nmatter  under discussion. He used very abstract\r\n\r\ntheories. His speech conveyed this meaning.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  that the proposal of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nfor  a merger of Singapore with the Federation,\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore citizens automatically becoming\r\n\r\nFederal citizens, will hearten communal parties - such  as  the  P.M.I.P. - in the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. This argument is not worth rebutting. I\r\n\r\nhope  he  will  examine carefully the  analysis\r\n\r\ngiven  by  our  Party Chairman with  regard  to\r\n\r\ncommunal issues and matters relating thereto.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have moved our amendment because it is good\r\n\r\nfor  the  people of Singapore and Malaya  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.   There  should  not  be  any   communal\r\n\r\nconflicts  or  any  other  unpleasant   results\r\n\r\nunless Machiavellian politicians want to create\r\n\r\ngreater differences among the different races.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture also pointed out that\r\n\r\nthe 13 Members in the Barisan Sosialis left the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. not  because of their stand on  merger,\r\n\r\nbut because they\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwanted  complete internal self-government.  This\r\n\r\nproves  that the P.A.P. are unreasonable on  the\r\n\r\nmerger issue. They are irrelevant without giving\r\n\r\nany reason.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the time of the Anson by-election, the P.A.P. raised very vague merger\r\n\r\nterms and they asked the people to vote on them.\r\n\r\nIn  the  end, the people passed very clear  judgment  on  the P.A.P. But the leadership  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. did  not  want  to accept  the  judgment\r\n\r\npassed on them by the people. They did not  want\r\n\r\nto  examine their own hypocritical act but  they\r\n\r\npushed their claim for -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang (Mr Tee Kim Leng) appears to be reading\r\n\r\na  newspaper. There is a Standing Order which  I\r\n\r\nmight  read  for the benefit of hon.  Members  - Standing Order 48 (d), which says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Members shall not read newspapers, books,\r\n\r\nletters  or other documents except such  matters\r\n\r\ntherein as may be directly connected with the\r\n\r\nbusiness under debate.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  I  take it that the Member for Pasir Panjang\r\n\r\nwas  probably  reading matters in the  newspaper\r\n\r\nwhich  were directly connected with the business\r\n\r\nunder debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): They accused\r\n\r\nus of stabbing the P.A.P. in the back. They made\r\n\r\nus a scapegoat for their defeat in Anson. But we\r\n\r\nhad  been in the P.A.P. for quite some time, and\r\n\r\nwe  clearly understand how the P.A.P. leadership\r\n\r\ntreated  the  people. They  used  to  resort  to\r\n\r\noppression,  and now they fall on all  fours  in\r\n\r\ntrying  to  appease  the colonialists  and  reactionaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leadership of the P.A.P. claim that merger\r\n\r\nis  now  in  view.  Now that  this  question  is\r\n\r\nraised,  the  people have many doubts  in  their\r\n\r\nminds.   First,   everybody   knows   that   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government has all along refused  to\r\n\r\nmerge.   And  the  P.A.P.'s  fourth  Anniversary\r\n\r\nSouvenir  also stated the reason why  the  Tunku\r\n\r\ndid  not  want merger - there are too many Chinese\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, and the strength of the Left-wing\r\n\r\nforces  in Singapore is too great. If  there  is\r\n\r\ntrue merger between Singapore and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya, it will affect their\r\n\r\npolitical  status and position. But the  number\r\n\r\nof  Chinese in Singapore today is not less than\r\n\r\nbefore, and the strength of Left-wing forces is\r\n\r\neven  greater than before. And yet why  is  the\r\n\r\nFederation very interested in merger now?  Does\r\n\r\nit mean that the Federation has already changed\r\n\r\nits  original  view  on  merger?  What  is  the\r\n\r\nreason?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the British have now changed their\r\n\r\nattitude towards merger, from one of silence to\r\n\r\none  of  interest.  Everybody  knows  that  the\r\n\r\nseparation  of  the  two  territories  was  the\r\n\r\nresult of the colonialist policy of divide  and\r\n\r\nrule.  But the present attitude of the  British\r\n\r\nis that they are now very agreeable to merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the leadership of the P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nsuddenly cried out that merger is now in  view,\r\n\r\nand made use of it as a kind of panacea to save\r\n\r\nthemselves. This is what we doubt very much. We\r\n\r\nwere Party cadres in the P.A.P. before. At that\r\n\r\ntime, the leadership of the Party never pointed\r\n\r\nout to us the possibility of reaching agreement\r\n\r\non  the  terms of merger. But now they suddenly\r\n\r\nannounce that merger is in view, and are  using\r\n\r\nthis  issue  as a very valuable bargain.  There\r\n\r\nmust be some reason for it. In the days when we\r\n\r\nwere   in  the  Party,  we  already  had   some\r\n\r\nsuspicion about the leadership of the P.A.P. We\r\n\r\nfound  out something - we knew they were prepared\r\n\r\nto sell out the people, particularly during the\r\n\r\nAnson  by-election,  when  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nfrankly  said  that we should  not  offend  the\r\n\r\nRight-wing  reactionaries.  This  created  more\r\n\r\ndoubts in the leadership of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, on the question of merger, why did\r\n\r\nthe   leadership   of  the  P.A.P. not   seek\r\n\r\npermission  from  the people  when  the  merger\r\n\r\nterms  were  announced? Why did the P.A.P. dis\r\n\r\ntort  the facts? When our terms of merger  were\r\n\r\nannounced,  the P.A.P. leadership  attacked  us\r\n\r\nand  accused us of distorting the facts, saying\r\n\r\nthat  we were anti-merger. I think the question\r\n\r\nof merger is a national issue. Everybody has  a\r\n\r\nright  to know. Everybody has a right  to  give\r\n\r\nhis opinion on merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the people should have a final say on\r\n\r\nthis matter. Why do the P.A.P. try to intimidate\r\n\r\nthose people who have a sense of responsibility?\r\n\r\nWe  had asked the Central Executive Committee\r\n\r\nto  accept our views on various aspects, but our\r\n\r\nviews  were all turned down or rejected. Instead\r\n\r\nthe  leadership  of  the P.A.P. were  very  dis\r\n\r\nsatisfied  and  accused us of many  things.  All\r\n\r\nthese  show  that the P.A.P. are  determined  to\r\n\r\nsell out the interests of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Culture has said\r\n\r\nthat   since   we  the  Barisan  Sosialis   want\r\n\r\nSingapore to merge with the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nand  form a State in it, why did we also  demand\r\n\r\nfull   internal  self-government?  It  is   very\r\n\r\ndifficult to understand his logic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Culture, as one\r\n\r\nof the three great leaders of the P.A.P. and one\r\n\r\nwho  was  at  one time an editor in the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes,  could  not understand the organ  of  our\r\n\r\nParty.   This  is  something  which   I   cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand. I think he is trying to confuse  the\r\n\r\npeople on the merger issue. This also shows that\r\n\r\nthe  theories  and  arguments  advanced  by  the\r\n\r\nleadership of the P.A.P. are empty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today things have changed. We have clearly\r\n\r\nseen  that the leadership of the P.A.P., because\r\n\r\nthey want to keep up their names and at the same\r\n\r\ntime  attack  the Leftists, insist on  having  a\r\n\r\nphoney   merger  which  sells  out  the  people.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,, they have to accept our amendment to\r\n\r\nthe  motion for a merger of Singapore  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche M.

Members of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  But  let  me have an  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nspeak.  The  objects  of my speech  are  clearly\r\n\r\nexpressed in the Malay language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, may I give a reminder that the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, on the whole, should  not\r\n\r\nget involved when members of the Socialist Front\r\n\r\nand others talk about politics in Singapore\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nand   the  Federation,  particularly  political\r\n\r\nspeeches and utterances about Manchuria and  so\r\n\r\non.   What   will   happen,   particularly   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  if  the  policy  of  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  with  regard to a genuine  merger  is\r\n\r\nfollowed? The Barisan Sosialis fights  for  the\r\n\r\npeople. Which people, Mr Speaker? Nationalists\r\n\r\nor  Communists? Mr Speaker, if we continue  to\r\n\r\nhear arguments and reasons from the Opposition,\r\n\r\nin  particular  from the Socialist  Front,  why\r\n\r\nmust  the  P.A.P. plan of merger  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation  of Malaya  be  rejected?\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing in their arguments that  are\r\n\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we study the heads of agreement reached\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and the Federation of Malaya,\r\n\r\nas  contained in the White Paper,  it  will  be\r\n\r\nclearly  seen  that the contents of  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper   generally  reflect  the   give-and-take\r\n\r\nspirit   of   both  the  Singapore   .and   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Governments with  a  view  to  safe\r\n\r\nguarding  local  and special  interests,  which\r\n\r\nform the legitimate rights of the people of the\r\n\r\ntwo   territories.  Firstly,  the   fundamental\r\n\r\nrights  of  the people of the two  territories,\r\n\r\nSingapore and the\r\n\r\nFederation,  will  not  be  violated   in   the\r\n\r\nslightest  way  after merger.  The  fundamental\r\n\r\nrights  of  the  people, Mr Speaker,  will  be\r\n\r\nadequately   protected   and   guaranteed,   as\r\n\r\nenunciated   in  the  Federation  Constitution.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the special position of the Singapore\r\n\r\nMalays  will  be safeguarded and guaranteed  in\r\n\r\nthe   future.   The  Federation   of   Malaysia\r\n\r\nConstitution  includes, among the basic  rights\r\n\r\nof  the  people  of  Singapore  which  will  be\r\n\r\nguaranteed according to the Government's merger\r\n\r\nproposals,     freedom    of     speech     and\r\n\r\nrepresentation, either orally or in writing and\r\n\r\nexpression  of  views in healthy  publications.\r\n\r\nThe  privileges  of the people  are  now  being\r\n\r\nenjoyed.  The right of the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  follow their own religious belief  is  also\r\n\r\nguaranteed in the Federation Constitution,  and\r\n\r\nalso  the  right  to  form associations,  trade\r\n\r\nunions  of  workers, to strike and picket,  and\r\n\r\nhost of other conditions in accordance with the\r\n\r\nlaws  of  the  State. All these rights  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  will  be  protected  and\r\n\r\nguaranteed\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the constitution of the future Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.

Suffice it for me\r\n\r\nto    reiterate   that   there   will   be   no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  at all between  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the people of the Federation  in\r\n\r\nthe   Federation   of  Malaysia   constitutional\r\n\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of representation in the\r\n\r\nFederal House of Representatives and the Senate,\r\n\r\nthe  position is much the same as for the other\r\n\r\nStates  now  forming the Federation  of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Johore,  Selangor or Kelantan,  except\r\n\r\nthat candidates and voters in Singapore can only\r\n\r\ncast   their  votes  in  Singapore.  We  should,\r\n\r\nhowever, bear in mind that, likewise, candidates\r\n\r\nand  voters in the Federation can only  vote  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.  Nevertheless,  Singapore  will\r\n\r\nhave   15   representatives   in   the   Federal\r\n\r\nParliament.  This agreement means that  although\r\n\r\nthe  electorate in Singapore can  only  vote  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and Federation voters can  only  vote\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation, nevertheless Singapore  can\r\n\r\ncontest seats in the Federal Parliament. This in\r\n\r\nturn  means  that, speaking from the  points  of\r\n\r\nview   of   political  Parties   and   political\r\n\r\nideologies,  there  is nothing  to  prevent  any\r\n\r\npolitical Party in Singapore, for example,  from\r\n\r\nforming an alliance with another political Party\r\n\r\nin  the Federation in order to capture power and\r\n\r\neventually hold the reins of government  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral   Government,  provided  that  the   two\r\n\r\nParties  can  successfully obtain a majority  of\r\n\r\nseats  in  the Federal Parliament.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Members demand that all citizens should\r\n\r\nbecome  Federal  citizens  unconditionally.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, it is clear in this House that this  is\r\n\r\na  demand  in  extremism. Can we who  are  in  a\r\n\r\nposition   of  an  applicant  put   forward   an\r\n\r\naggressive  demand  so that  the  supplier  will\r\n\r\naccede  to  our demand? It is clear that  if  we\r\n\r\nmerge with the Federation, we must abide by  the\r\n\r\nFederation  laws as laid down by the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment. Then only can we say that this is a\r\n\r\njudicious and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nparliamentary  action. Mr  Speaker,  you  will\r\n\r\nagree with me that if we ask for the hand of  a\r\n\r\ngirl,  as  explained  by  a  Member  from   the\r\n\r\nAlliance,  both  parties must  be  prepared  to\r\n\r\ncompromise,  and  whatever  agreement   reached\r\n\r\nshould  be  satisfactory to both sides.  If  we\r\n\r\nsimply  try  to  impose our conditions  on  the\r\n\r\nother  party the marriage proposal will in  all\r\n\r\nlikelihood be rejected. If it is rejected, whom\r\n\r\nwill  the  Members of the Barisan Sosialis  woo\r\n\r\nnext? I believe the reply is Mao Tse-tung or Ho\r\n\r\nChi Min.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas  explained  that if we  effect  a  complete\r\n\r\nmerger  with  the Federation of Malaya  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  Penang and Malacca, this  will  mean\r\n\r\nthat  a  large number of our Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nwill  lose their citizenship rights. The reason\r\n\r\nis that many Singapore citizens cannot meet the\r\n\r\ncitizenship requirements of the Federation, in\r\n\r\norder  to  become  Federal  citizens.  In  this\r\n\r\nevent,   hundreds  of  thousands  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens   will  be  frustrated.  Citizens   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  are now enjoying various  privileges and benefits in Singapore will lose these\r\n\r\nprivileges.   These  privileges   include   the\r\n\r\nsecuring  of  Housing Development Board  flats,\r\n\r\njobs  in  the Government service, land  in  the\r\n\r\nJurong development scheme, social welfare dole,\r\n\r\nfree  education and other social services.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  only those persons  who  become\r\n\r\nFederal citizens and only\r\n\r\nthose  who can satisfy the citizenship laws  of\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  can  enjoy  such  privileges.\r\n\r\nWhereas  all the people of Singapore  who  have\r\n\r\nhitherto enjoyed all these privileges will lose\r\n\r\ntheir citizenship rights. They will be deprived\r\n\r\nof  all  the privileges I have enumerated  just\r\n\r\nnow,  because, according to demand made by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nand  his colleagues, there will be no Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  There  will  only  exist  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship. Surely the people of Singapore  do\r\n\r\nnot want this to happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the marathon speech of the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown,  he  touched  on   the\r\n\r\neducation  and labour policies of the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment. If we were to accept the demand  of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis,  the  education  policy   of\r\n\r\ngiving  equal treatment to all language  streams\r\n\r\nwould   disappear.  Likewise,  much  progressive\r\n\r\nlabour  legislation which has been  approved  by\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government would disappear. This will\r\n\r\nbe  the  result of complete merger. On  complete\r\n\r\nmerger,  we will have to abide by the  education\r\n\r\nand    labour   policies   of   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment. The Barisan Sosialis fear  that  the\r\n\r\nwrath  of  the people of Singapore  will  be  on\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to explain further\r\n\r\nthe  points  raised by Members  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. They say that the P.A.P. is misleading\r\n\r\nthe  people, that the P.A.P. is insincere,  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is  cheating the people,  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is bankrupt - blank cheque - and is selling\r\n\r\nout the people and frightening the voters. I pay\r\n\r\nno  heed  at all to all this. But if the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong  Lim  says that this is three-quarters\r\n\r\nmerger,  I  say it means that he agrees  to  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  compromise. Mr Speaker, it  is  not\r\n\r\nsurprising to me, if we think we are smart or if\r\n\r\nwe have gone astray, to mislead the others. This\r\n\r\nis  a  great  sin.  I would remind  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis about this. It is like a parrot who can\r\n\r\nstill talk even now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown and other Members  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis have brought up before this\r\n\r\nHouse three main issues.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> On a point of\r\n\r\norder, Sir,Is the Minister for Finance now  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it the hon.

The first issue\r\n\r\nis  based on the term \"genuine merger\"  in  the\r\n\r\namendment.  By that, Sir, they put  before  the\r\n\r\nHouse  and  before the people of Singapore  the\r\n\r\nissue that their's is a genuine merger and  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. type  of  merger is phoney.  Then  they\r\n\r\nraise  another issue, that their type of merger\r\n\r\nis  complete  and the other type is  incomplete\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  bad or tiga suku.  The  third\r\n\r\nissue  raised,  Sir,  is  that  on  Merger  Day\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens should automatically  become\r\n\r\nFederal nationals and Federal citizens not only\r\n\r\nin Singapore but that they should also have the\r\n\r\nright  of  transferability to vote or to  stand\r\n\r\nfor election in any part of the Federation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a former school-master and a student\r\n\r\nof history, I have been very unhappy about this\r\n\r\nincorrect use of the term \"merger\". However, it\r\n\r\nwas  pointed out to me that since it  is  being\r\n\r\nused  in the local context to mean any form  of\r\n\r\npolitical union, therefore, I should not raised\r\n\r\nany  objection. But listening to the debate,  I\r\n\r\nrealise that because of the inaccurate  use  of\r\n\r\nthe  term \"merger\", there has been a great deal\r\n\r\nof  misunderstanding. So the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown has rightly brought  us\r\n\r\ndown to the realisation that we must define the\r\n\r\nterm  \"merger\",  and  he  has  used  the  words\r\n\r\n\"genuine merger\". Sir, we have been going round\r\n\r\nand round the merry-go-round, round the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmerry Member for Queenstown for days and days. I\r\n\r\nthink it is time we go to a proper authority and\r\n\r\nask for clarification.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we go to the historians and the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  experts,  we   find   that   the\r\n\r\ninformation  they give us is very startling.  It\r\n\r\nshows   that   the   so-called  genuine   merger\r\n\r\ndescribed  by the Member for Queenstown  is  not\r\n\r\nonly  not genuine but not a merger! If a diamond\r\n\r\nclaimed  to be a genuine diamond is not genuine,\r\n\r\nhow   can   it  be  even  a  diamond?  A   clear\r\n\r\nexplanation  of  the  term  \"merger\",  as   used\r\n\r\nhistorically to apply to a political  union,  is\r\n\r\ngiven,  Sir,  in  a  book written  by  a  Rhodes\r\n\r\nProfessor  of History of London University.  The\r\n\r\nbook\r\n\r\nis entitled \"Federal and Unified Constitutions\"\r\n\r\nby A. P. Newton. I propose, Sir, to read very\r\n\r\nshort extracts from page 2. He is talking about\r\n\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A State's existence continues until society\r\n\r\nis completely dissolved into anarchy or until it\r\n\r\nis merged into some other State. The merging may\r\n\r\nbe  complete [so there is a case for a  complete\r\n\r\nand an incomplete merger] either by conquest  or\r\n\r\nby  voluntary absorption, in both of which cases\r\n\r\n[and this is the important point], the existence\r\n\r\nof the merged State has come to an end.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that is what a merger is, then what\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis Member for Queenstown wants\r\n\r\nis  not  a  genuine  merger,  because  he  wants\r\n\r\nSingapore  to go in as the twelfth State.  In  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  merger, Singapore cannot go in  as  the\r\n\r\ntwelfth State. Singapore politically must  cease\r\n\r\nto  exist  as a State. It can only go  in  as  a\r\n\r\ncounty, as a district or as a province. It  must\r\n\r\nlose its State Assembly. It cannot legislate. In\r\n\r\nthat  case,  we can then describe a State  as  a\r\n\r\nunitary State - an example of a genuine merger.\r\n\r\nSir, if this is what a genuine merger really is,\r\n\r\nin  the  light  of  history  as  exemplified  by\r\n\r\npolitical unions which are of the genuine merger\r\n\r\ntype, then we have all gone wrong somewhere.  By\r\n\r\nbeing  too loose in our use of the term, we  are\r\n\r\nconfusing Members in different sections of  this\r\n\r\nHouse and also members of the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npublic.  I  think it is time that  we  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly help people here and outside to  think\r\n\r\nrightly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me quote two examples of genuine\r\n\r\nmerger. Great Britain is a good example,  where\r\n\r\nEngland,  Scotland and Wales have  been  merged\r\n\r\ninto  one  unitary  State. There  is  only  one\r\n\r\nParliament and these separate States have  lost\r\n\r\ntheir  political  existence - Scotland,  England\r\n\r\nand  Wales.  Northern Ireland,  which  came  in\r\n\r\nlater,  Sir,  refused  to  lose  its  political\r\n\r\nidentity and existence and, therefore, it  went\r\n\r\nin  on  a  special basis, on a loose Federation\r\n\r\nbasis or confederation basis. That is why today\r\n\r\nwe  get  the  grouping described as the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  of Great Britain (that is, the  merged\r\n\r\nState) and Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South Africa is another example of a genuine\r\n\r\nmerger. The United States of America are not an\r\n\r\nexample of a genuine merger. They are a Federal\r\n\r\nunion. In South Africa, Sir, there is only  one\r\n\r\nCentral   Parliament.  There  is  no   separate\r\n\r\nlegislature  in  Natal,  Cape  Colony  or   the\r\n\r\nTransvaal. They only have provincial  councils.\r\n\r\nAll  have been merged under one supreme central\r\n\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one danger about this type of\r\n\r\nmerger.  Reference has been made to  apartheid.\r\n\r\nWhere differences of race and language have not\r\n\r\nbeen   completely  reconciled,  it   is   quite\r\n\r\npossible  in a merged state for one section  to\r\n\r\ndominate  Parliament  and therefore  pass  laws\r\n\r\nwhich are\r\n\r\nnot quite fair to another section of the\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Malaya we had a genuine merger type\r\n\r\nof  political union from 1946 to 1948. That was\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan Union. It lasted only three years,\r\n\r\nSir, because the Malays all over the Federation\r\n\r\nprotested   strongly  against  this   type   of\r\n\r\npolitical  union. The result was  that  it  was\r\n\r\nabandoned  and  the Federation  of  Malaya  was\r\n\r\nrestored to them in 1948. So there is  no  real\r\n\r\nexample today of a genuine merger -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMPLAINT ON MATTER OF</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PRIVILEGE AFFECTING MEMBER</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Acting Leader of the House (Mr S.

They surrounded  him\r\n\r\nand abused him and refused to let him through to\r\n\r\nattend  this sitting, despite the fact  that  he\r\n\r\nexplained  to  them that he was on  his  way  to\r\n\r\nattend this Assembly sitting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary was already aware\r\n\r\nthat  at the T.T.C. earlier this morning,  rowdy\r\n\r\npicketers,  who  wanted to  intimidate  students\r\n\r\nfrom  taking  the examinations, had resorted  to\r\n\r\nviolence  and  hooliganism.

I seek your guidance,\r\n\r\nSir, on enforcing the motion which was formally\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the leader of the House on  20th  of\r\n\r\nNovember  and  approved by  this  House,  which\r\n\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this Assembly orders that the Com\r\n\r\nmissioner  of Police do take care  that  during\r\n\r\nthe  present session of this House the passages\r\n\r\nthrough the streets leading to this House be\r\n\r\nkept free and open, and that no obstruction  be\r\n\r\npermitted  to hinder the passage of Members  to\r\n\r\nand  from  this House, and that no disorder  be\r\n\r\nallowed in the passages leading to this  House.\r\n\r\nand  that  there  be no annoyance  therein  and\r\n\r\nthereabouts;  and  that  the  Clerk   of   this\r\n\r\nAssembly do communicate this order to\r\n\r\nthe Commissioner aforesaid.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask, therefore, that the Members of\r\n\r\nthis  House approve this motion, that no Member\r\n\r\nshould be obstructed or intimidated from  doing\r\n\r\nhis duty as a representative of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not suppose the Minister is\r\n\r\nreally moving a motion. This is not the time to\r\n\r\nmove a motion. I understood the Minister to say\r\n\r\n\"motion\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was\r\n\r\nseeking your guidance on this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Of course, I must be satisfied - I\r\n\r\nam,   in   fact,  satisfied - that   the   matter\r\n\r\ncomplained  of  does  prima  facie  affect  the\r\n\r\nprivileges  of  the  Assembly,  and  that   the\r\n\r\ncomplaint  alleging a breach of  privilege  has\r\n\r\nsuddenly  arisen. Therefore, under our Standing\r\n\r\nOrders,  the  matter must be  referred  to  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  of Privileges, and it is accordingly\r\n\r\nso  referred.  But  I would like  to  draw  the\r\n\r\nattention of Hon. Members to the fact  that  we\r\n\r\nhave a Privileges Bill which the Government had\r\n\r\nintended to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nput through all three stages on a Certificate of\r\n\r\nUrgency,  perhaps anticipating that  trouble  of\r\n\r\nthis  nature would arise and that Bill  has  now\r\n\r\nbeen referred to\r\n\r\na  Select  Committee. It will, of  course,  take\r\n\r\nsome  time before it is passed. Under that Bill,\r\n\r\nif,   in  fact,  the  police  had  arrested  any\r\n\r\nstranger  who  had  prevented the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  from  coming to  the  Assembly,  that\r\n\r\nstranger could\r\n\r\nhave been brought before this Assembly and could\r\n\r\nhave  been  dealt with at once. But we  are  now\r\n\r\noperating  under  the old Privileges  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nand section 15 of that Ordinance is the relevant\r\n\r\nsection. It reads\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any stranger in respect of the Assembly\r\n\r\nwho -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) hinders or obstructs any member of the\r\n\r\nAssembly  coming to, going from or being  within\r\n\r\nthe Chamber or the precincts thereof;',\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and then there are other offences which\r\n\r\nare not relevant,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'shall be guilty of an offence and shall be\r\n\r\nliable  on conviction to a fine of one  thousand\r\n\r\ndollars or to imprisonment for six months or  to\r\n\r\nboth such fine and imprisonment.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>And under section 32:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No prosecution shall be instituted for an\r\n\r\noffence  under  this Ordinance except  with  the\r\n\r\nwritten sanction of the State Advocate-General.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in so far as the incident complained of is\r\n\r\nconcerned, I have no doubt that if the  culprits\r\n\r\nor  the strangers are apprehended, they will  be\r\n\r\nprosecuted under a fiat from the State  Advocate-General   under  section  15  of  the   present\r\n\r\nPrivileges Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point, the conduct of Members, I\r\n\r\nmight as well read the relevant section which is\r\n\r\napplicable now - section 20 of the same Privileges\r\n\r\nOrdinance:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(1) Any member of the Assembly who -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) assaults or obstructs a member of the\r\n\r\nAssembly within the Chamber or precincts of the\r\n\r\nAssembly; ...\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>shall be guilty of contempt of the Assembly.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has not arisen at the moment. For\r\n\r\ncontempt  in  this Assembly, it is,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly which can deal with the  culprit.\r\n\r\nThat covers the point, Mr Minister?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are\r\n\r\ntwo  points  arising. I mentioned one  whets  I\r\n\r\nraised  this  question. Though  I  concede  the\r\n\r\npoint that the Committee of Privileges has  not\r\n\r\ncome into being, there is an impression outside\r\n\r\namong  the picketers that some Members of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  are not with this House in condemning\r\n\r\nthem,  and are also perhaps with them in  their\r\n\r\nattempt now to prevent Assemblymen from  coming\r\n\r\nto this Assembly. A member of this Assembly who\r\n\r\nwanted  to  come to this Assembly informed  the\r\n\r\npicketers that he wanted to attend a sitting of\r\n\r\nthis Assembly, but he was prevented. Therefore,\r\n\r\none  way  would be for this House  to  make  it\r\n\r\nquite  clear to the picketers that any  attempt\r\n\r\nby  any  picketer to obstruct  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly from performing their duties will  not\r\n\r\nbe  condoned  by  any  single  Member  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is the first point which\r\n\r\nI  think  will greatly assist Members in  being\r\n\r\nable  to  perform their duties. If it is  made\r\n\r\nquite  clear  outside that any attempt  by  any\r\n\r\noutsider to interfere with the right of Members\r\n\r\nto  attend  this  Assembly would  at  least  be\r\n\r\ncondemned  by  this  Assembly,  then  it  would\r\n\r\ncertainly have a salutary effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point, I would ask for your\r\n\r\nguidance  on  a  practical issue.  There  is  a\r\n\r\nMember of the Assembly who has been intimidated\r\n\r\ninto staying in the Ministry of Education.  How\r\n\r\ndo  you  propose to help him out of a situation\r\n\r\nwhich  as  you yourself indicated earlier,  has\r\n\r\nbeen brought about because, rightly or wrongly,\r\n\r\nthere were objections to the rushing through of\r\n\r\nthe     Legislative    Assembly    (Privileges,\r\n\r\nImmunities and Powers) Bill? Therefore, we  are\r\n\r\nnow  put in a situation where a contingency has\r\n\r\narisen,  where  one  of  our  Members   is   de\r\n\r\nliberately  prevented by picketers from  coming\r\n\r\nto  this Assembly. Therefore, I am seeking your\r\n\r\nguidance on the second end more practical issue\r\n\r\nof  how  to ensure the attendance of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bukit Panjang here. I also understand that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education may be in a similar\r\n\r\npredicament.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two points. First, Members of the\r\n\r\nHouse   will  make  it  quite  clear  that   any\r\n\r\npicketers  who  interfere with  the  rights  and\r\n\r\nprivileges  of  the  Assembly  will  meet   with\r\n\r\npublic  disapproval, and secondly, your guidance\r\n\r\non  the  more  practical matter of how  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith this situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On the first point, it is up to\r\n\r\nMembers  either in this Assembly or outside  the\r\n\r\nAssembly to make definite pronouncements on  the\r\n\r\nmatter. I cannot, of course, ask them to do  so.\r\n\r\nBut  they  as Members of the Assembly  would,  I\r\n\r\ntake it, wholeheartedly approve any action which\r\n\r\nmight  punish any stranger who is  guilty  of  a\r\n\r\nbreach  of  the privileges of this Assembly.  On\r\n\r\nthe  face  of it, it is clear that a  breach  of\r\n\r\nprivilege has been committed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point as to what can be done,\r\n\r\nall  that comes to my mind is that, prima facie,\r\n\r\nan  offence has been committed by a stranger  or\r\n\r\nstrangers  and, therefore, we must rely  on  the\r\n\r\npolice to bring that stranger or those strangers\r\n\r\nto  book.  I  suppose  by  that  means  the  Parliamentary   Secretary - and  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation  if  he  is  being  hindered - would  be\r\n\r\nreleased  and perhaps escorted to this  Assembly\r\n\r\nHouse.  As  far  as the Assembly  is  concerned,\r\n\r\nnothing further can be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am sorry if it is\r\n\r\nreally true that this Assembly is reduced  to  a\r\n\r\nstate of impotence as a result of our not having\r\n\r\npassed  the  Legislative  Assembly  (Privileges,\r\n\r\nImmunities and Powers) Bill. But surely,  whilst\r\n\r\nwe may not have executive powers, it is our duty\r\n\r\nas  a Legislature to express the collective will\r\n\r\nof  the  people so that all can know which  side\r\n\r\nthis House is on - for law and order according  to\r\n\r\nthe  rules  laid down by the representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe  people, or according to the rough-house  of\r\n\r\nstones and bottles and mobs and hooligans.

For this reason, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation, who is not here today because, as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  it,  he  is  beleaguered,  has  not\r\n\r\nallowed the police to intervene in any  of  the\r\n\r\nincidents  relating  to  the  intimidation   to\r\n\r\nenforce the boycott.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would allow us now, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  suggest, as a matter of urgency, to  move  a\r\n\r\nmotion first, that we condemn this conduct, and\r\n\r\nsecond,  that  we  as  representatives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  call upon the police - not the Government\r\n\r\ncalling  upon the police - to ensure  that  those\r\n\r\nsections  of  the present Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\n(Powers and Privileges) Ordinance are enforced.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Perhaps you would permit a\r\n\r\nsuggestion?

And  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nclarify  that position, although you  have  very\r\n\r\nkindly indicated that the proper way is for  him\r\n\r\nto  move  an amendment. But, nevertheless,  the\r\n\r\npublic  impression is, of course,  that  he  has\r\n\r\nmade  a  request  for rephrasing  to  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment must respond.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Government prepared to\r\n\r\nrespond to that?

The\r\n\r\nMember  for Nee Soon was extremely reluctant  to\r\n\r\nmove  an  amendment for various reasons  of  his\r\n\r\nown,   although  he  does  not  alike  the  word\r\n\r\n\"hooligans\" and perhaps one or two other  words.\r\n\r\nAnd  he  has  asked  us to  rephrase.  You  have\r\n\r\npointed  out to him that that is not the  proper\r\n\r\nway.  He  must  amend  if he  wishes  it  to  be\r\n\r\nremoved. Sir, no doubt the debate will go on  to\r\n\r\nits  logical  conclusion where if  there  is  no\r\n\r\nunanimity,  sides are taken to the  discomfiture\r\n\r\nof the people who take the wrong side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned that there should be no misimpression on the Members, the Stranger's\r\n\r\nGallery,  the  Press  and  the  general   public\r\n\r\noutside, that what we are debating now is not  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of abstract principle but two  Members\r\n\r\nof this Assembly who are at present beleaguered.\r\n\r\nAnd,  therefore, I would like  to  say  that  no\r\n\r\nmatter how the thing is phrased or rephrased, as\r\n\r\nit  stands it assumes nothing, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nIt  only  assumes that this House  endorses  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  that  the  law  should  be   enforced\r\n\r\nagainst  these  people,  be  they  students   or\r\n\r\nwhoever else.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But  as  far as the Barisan  Sosialis  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  we  agree wholeheartedly  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  no Member  of  this  Assembly\r\n\r\nshould  be illegally prevented by anybody  from\r\n\r\nentering these premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to point out that in\r\n\r\nso   far   as   this  particular  incident   is\r\n\r\nconcerned, the place in which it took place  is\r\n\r\noutside  the vicinity of this House, and  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  understand why the Government should  have\r\n\r\nthought it necessary to raise this matter here,\r\n\r\nask\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nMembers  of  this House to express their  views,\r\n\r\nand  to  state  their stand.

He told\r\n\r\nme that he did not have his transport. So I told\r\n\r\nhim  that  he  could use my car to come  to  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  He  was accompanied by  two  security\r\n\r\nofficers  and my driver. The car is SS  6103.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  my  Parliamentary  Secretary  left  the\r\n\r\noffice  at  about  2.15  this  afternoon  and  I\r\n\r\ndecided  to walk right across to the other  side\r\n\r\nof  the  building where I could at least have  a\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  group  of  people  who  had  been\r\n\r\npicketing  Kay  Siang Road since early  morning.\r\n\r\nWhat   I   could   see  was  my  car   gradually\r\n\r\napproaching this nest of young students - boys and\r\n\r\ngirls - numbering  between 50 and  60.  They  were\r\n\r\nchanting. I remember having gone to Bali to  see\r\n\r\nwhat  is called a \"ketjak\" dance, where a  group\r\n\r\nof  people  would  sing  songs  in  this  manner\r\n\r\n\"ketjak,  ketjak, ketjak\". I could  see  from  a\r\n\r\ndistance that my car was not permitted to  leave\r\n\r\nand  that  it  had to get into reverse  gear  to\r\n\r\nreturn.  They  were jumping with  joy  at  their\r\n\r\nvictory  to prevent the Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nfrom  coming  to  this Assembly to  perform  his\r\n\r\nduties both as an Assemblyman and as the Whip of\r\n\r\nthis Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, is what I personally saw. There\r\n\r\nwere  witnesses  to this. I am sure  there  were\r\n\r\nmany  people  in the Ministry of  Education  who\r\n\r\nwere watching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very fortunate\r\n\r\nto  have  got  myself free  and  to  reach  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Events developed in this way. This morning at\r\n\r\nabout 9 I went to my office at Kay Siang by  way\r\n\r\nof  Kay  Siang Road. I saw a group  of  students\r\n\r\nblocking the road. I came out of my car and told\r\n\r\nthem  that I wanted to go to my office for duty.\r\n\r\nI asked them to let me go on, but they shouted a\r\n\r\nslogan,  \"Lee  Khoon Choy, go into the  coffin!\"\r\n\r\nThey\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nshouted \"Lee Khoon, khoon Choy\" I asked them why\r\n\r\nthey  did  not  want  to  take  the  Government\r\n\r\nexaminations and they replied, \"Your  Government\r\n\r\nwant to destroy Chinese education.\" I told them,\r\n\r\n\"Let us not talk about this. Will you please let\r\n\r\nme go to my office for duty?\" They replied, \"No,\r\n\r\nyou  cannot  do  that. You must  accede  to  our\r\n\r\nrequest.\" Then I said, \"This is something  which\r\n\r\nI  cannot do. So will you please let me go  in?\"\r\n\r\nBut  they  surrounded me. I found the  situation\r\n\r\nwas  not right because they were sitting on  the\r\n\r\nroad with their buttocks facing me. I found  the\r\n\r\nsituation  not very pleasant. So I proceeded  to\r\n\r\nmy office by way of another path. There was also\r\n\r\nanother  group of students who were not  perhaps\r\n\r\nwell  organised, and they were shouting slogans.\r\n\r\nLater on, at 2.15 in the afternoon I borrowed  a\r\n\r\ncar  from the Minister, because my car was under\r\n\r\nrepair, - I had told my mechanic to take  away  my\r\n\r\ncar  at about 11 o'clock in the morning - to leave\r\n\r\nthe  office  by  Kay Siang Road. This  group  of\r\n\r\nstudents saw me and they blocked me again. There\r\n\r\nwere  about  seven  or eight of  them  and  they\r\n\r\npressed against the car. Some of them surrounded\r\n\r\nme. I told them that I was on my way to come  to\r\n\r\nthis  House  for  a sitting but they  would  not\r\n\r\nlisten. 'They continued to shout that slogan and\r\n\r\nthey would not listen to what I said. As I found\r\n\r\nthe  situation was not right and as  I  did  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  see any incident, I had to turn  back.\r\n\r\nWhen  they  saw  this, they put up  their  hands\r\n\r\nshouting,  \"We  have  won! We  are  victorious!\"\r\n\r\nThese are the events which took place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have forgotten to mention another point. When\r\n\r\nI  went  out, there was a member of a radio  car\r\n\r\nfollowing me. If you do not believe what I  have\r\n\r\ntold  you here, we can let you know the kind  of\r\n\r\nslogans  they shouted.

They\r\n\r\ntold  me,  \"If you want to leave, you can  leave\r\n\r\nbecause the students have dispersed.\" But I  was\r\n\r\nwondering whether the students could disperse so\r\n\r\neasily  and  so  early.  And  where  could   the\r\n\r\nstudents  get the information? Could it  perhaps\r\n\r\ncome from this Assembly? I was wondering. Now  I\r\n\r\nhave come to this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, just now we have\r\n\r\nmoved   an  amendment.  The  principle  is   the\r\n\r\nsafeguarding of all Assemblymen so that they can\r\n\r\nmove  freely in the vicinity of this House. This\r\n\r\nis  without question. We quite agree.  But  from\r\n\r\nwhat the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education  has reported to us,  this  shows\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  some motive in suddenly  moving\r\n\r\nthis  motion  today. The point is whether  there\r\n\r\nwas  anyone who had telephoned the students from\r\n\r\nhere  about the Assembly discussing this matter,\r\n\r\nand the students therefore dispersed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the motion safeguarding the rights\r\n\r\nof  Assemblymen.  But  from  the  motion  as  it\r\n\r\nstands,  we  have ample reasons to believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is making use of this motion  to\r\n\r\nhint that we have connections with the students.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that the Government, while\r\n\r\ndebating  on a very important question affecting\r\n\r\nthe  future  of  the people of  Singapore,  were\r\n\r\naware  that  they  were at a disadvantage,  that\r\n\r\nthere were no reasons or grounds to support -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

There was\r\n\r\nno   such   intention.  But   if   he,   as   an\r\n\r\neducationist,    could   not   persuade    these\r\n\r\nyoungsters  and youths, then he should  go  back\r\n\r\nand  ask the staff of the Education Ministry  to\r\n\r\npersuade    the   students.   But   since    the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary felt that it was a great\r\n\r\ndanger  to  him  and that he  needed  the  whole\r\n\r\nAssembly  to  protect him, then, of  course,  we\r\n\r\nsympathise with him. But if what he has told  us\r\n\r\nis  a  fact,  then in principle,  as  our  Party\r\n\r\nChairman  has said, we have moved the amendment.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  hope that after the amendment is passed,\r\n\r\nthe Parliamentary Secretary will feel safe to go\r\n\r\nto  his  office.

The Chair has just pointed out  that\r\n\r\nthere has been an allegation that an Assemblyman\r\n\r\nhas  been prevented from coming into the  House.\r\n\r\nThe  law  says  that anybody who  does  that  is\r\n\r\nguilty  of  an  offence.

Item 2 on the Order Paper,\r\n\r\ndebate  on the amendment as shown in that  item.\r\n\r\nDr Thio.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nafraid  most  of us have forgotten what  I  said\r\n\r\nbefore the interruption. So, Sir, forgive me  if\r\n\r\nI try to bring the threads together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying, Sir, that in the eyes of\r\n\r\nhistorians and constitutional experts, the  term\r\n\r\n\"genuine  merger\" or \"complete  merger\"  is  not\r\n\r\nreally applicable to the Malayan situation.  Use\r\n\r\nit  loosely if we must, but we have  to  say  it\r\n\r\nclearly that in a loose sense, the word \"merger\"\r\n\r\napplies  to  practically any form  of  political\r\n\r\nunion.  Because of the Government's  mistake  in\r\n\r\nnot  clarifying  the term, the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown has followed up that  mis\r\n\r\ntake by arguing in favour of a genuine merger as\r\n\r\nagainst a phoney merger. I am afraid the  public\r\n\r\noutside are being misled because of that. It  is\r\n\r\nimportant   to   realise  that   what   we   are\r\n\r\nconsidering\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nfor  Malaya are various forms of partial merger,\r\n\r\nand  these  forms  are known  to  historians  as\r\n\r\nFederal  unions. Federal unions are  of  roughly\r\n\r\ntwo  kinds.  One kind is that of  a  federation,\r\n\r\nsometimes  tighter than others,  sometimes  less\r\n\r\ntight.  Another form is the confederation  type.\r\n\r\nIn   between,   there  again   may   be   slight\r\n\r\nvariations.  Each one, Sir, has its own  special\r\n\r\ncharacteristics.  For the sake  of  analogy,  to\r\n\r\nenable  some  people  to understand  better  the\r\n\r\ndifference between these two types, let  us  say\r\n\r\nthat  a  federation  is like  a  hand  with  the\r\n\r\nfingers  linked  together to the  main  body  by\r\n\r\nmeans  of the palm and the arm. Now, the  States\r\n\r\nin  the Federation have some liberties, Sir, but\r\n\r\nthey  cannot move round and round like the  arm.\r\n\r\nThey are restricted in their movements. They are\r\n\r\nStates in a federation. They are one in a sense,\r\n\r\nbut the emphasis here is on all the powers being\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  Central  Government  except  for\r\n\r\ncertain  specified ones given to the States.  In\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  a confederation type  of  partial\r\n\r\nmerger, Sir, Singapore is like the whole arm. It\r\n\r\ngives  to  the  Central Government only  certain\r\n\r\nspecified powers like external affairs,  defence\r\n\r\nand  security; then all the rest  are  given  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It is a very loose type  of  federal\r\n\r\nunion, generally known as a confederation. Where\r\n\r\nthe  people  are  not ready to be  closely  tied\r\n\r\ntogether  because  of differences  of  language,\r\n\r\ncustoms  and  religious  beliefs,  they  usually\r\n\r\nstart  by  going  on  to the  first  stage,  the\r\n\r\nconfederation type of federal union.  When  they\r\n\r\nhave  learnt  to trust one another better,  then\r\n\r\nthey  go  on to the second stage, the federation\r\n\r\ntype  of  federal union. When they  have  really\r\n\r\nsunk  all differences and have become completely\r\n\r\nmalayanised  so that they can think together  as\r\n\r\none  without reservation, without any fears  and\r\n\r\nany  suspicions then they go on to the last  and\r\n\r\nultimate  stage,  that  of  genuine  merger   as\r\n\r\nexemplified in Great Britain and in the Union of\r\n\r\nSouth  Africa. But to press for a genuine merger\r\n\r\nright  away when we have not yet sorted out  our\r\n\r\ndifferences may give rise to a situation, as  in\r\n\r\nSouth Africa, where the coloured races feel that\r\n\r\nthey are being discriminated against.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Swiss confederation began as far back\r\n\r\nas  1291. That was the first federal pact  known\r\n\r\nin  modern history  - 1291 - centuries before they\r\n\r\nlearned to trust one another enough until  final\r\n\r\nly,  round about 1848, they formed their federal\r\n\r\nrepublic, the same type of federal union  as  we\r\n\r\nsee  in  the Federation, with slight variations.\r\n\r\nThe  American States also went through the  same\r\n\r\nstages. On 15th November, 1777, 13 States signed\r\n\r\nthe Articles of Confederation. Their purpose was\r\n\r\nfor a firm league of friendship with one another\r\n\r\nfor common defence, security of their liberties,\r\n\r\nand their mutual and genuine welfare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if Singapore wishes to link up with the\r\n\r\nFederation  in  a tight federation  but  if  the\r\n\r\nMalays  are  unprepared to accept  Singapore  on\r\n\r\nthat basis, then, of course, our - I am using  the\r\n\r\nterm roughly now - merger plans will never advance\r\n\r\none  inch. But because the American States began\r\n\r\nwith  a  confederation,  10  years  later,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhaving   developed  sufficient  trust   in   one\r\n\r\nanother,  and  having become  convinced  of  the\r\n\r\ngreater  strength  to  be produced  in  a  tight\r\n\r\nfederation,  they then formed the United  States\r\n\r\nof America on a federal basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Alliance believe that although\r\n\r\nwe  all  aim for genuine merger as the ultimate\r\n\r\ntype, in order to ensure success, we have to do\r\n\r\nit  by  stages. If necessary, we should go  for\r\n\r\nthe  first stage, the confederation stage; then\r\n\r\nafter  five years, review the position, and  go\r\n\r\nfor  the federation type; then after that, when\r\n\r\nthe people are all ready, we can have a genuine\r\n\r\nmerger type of union.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another important point to remember is\r\n\r\nthat  political unions are like different suits\r\n\r\nof   clothes  of  different  sizes.  They   fit\r\n\r\ndifferent  people at people at different  times\r\n\r\naccording  to their different ages. One  cannot\r\n\r\nsay  that this suit is complete and, therefore,\r\n\r\nit  is  good  that  suit  is  incomplete,  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  it  is bad. On that basis,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsuppose,  because  I  wear  a  complete   suit,\r\n\r\ntherefore, I am in a better position than those\r\n\r\nwho wear incomplete suits. They find themselves\r\n\r\nmore comfortable,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nperhaps,  to  be  in  incomplete  suits.

At  the  seaside,\r\n\r\npeople find it better to be in scanty clothes.\r\n\r\nHere  they  prefer to have warmer clothes.  In\r\n\r\nthe  same way, Sir, in Singapore with so  much\r\n\r\nindependence  of spirit shown  by  youngsters,\r\n\r\nthey may prefer greater freedom. They may want\r\n\r\na  looser  form  of merger than  that  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Therefore, the confederation  type\r\n\r\nof  federal union would suit them well,  where\r\n\r\nonly certain specified powers are reserved  to\r\n\r\nthe Central Government and all residual powers\r\n\r\nare given to the State of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest we reconsider whether or not\r\n\r\na  form of political union is suitable for us\r\n\r\non   the  following  basis.  We  should   ask\r\n\r\nourselves  whether  this  form  of  political\r\n\r\nunion is suitable, workable and acceptable to\r\n\r\nthe  contracting countries. If it is suitable\r\n\r\nto  only  one  or two and not  to  the  rest,\r\n\r\nacceptable only to one and not to the  other,\r\n\r\nSir,  then  we  do  not have  the  basis  for\r\n\r\nagreement.  Therefore,  merger  negotiations,\r\n\r\nagain using the term roughly, would fail.  Se\r\n\r\ncondly,  we should ask ourselves whether  the\r\n\r\ntype  of political union we are pressing  for\r\n\r\nmakes for greater or less racial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nharmony  and happiness. Thirdly, is it  mutually\r\n\r\nbeneficial?  And  fourthly,  does  it  help   to\r\n\r\npromote   greater   economic   prosperity   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, greater chances of employment for our\r\n\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, considered on this basis, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis suggestion that a citizen ,of Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  have  transferability of votes - they  say\r\n\r\nthey  have the right to transfer themselves over\r\n\r\nthe  Causeway  to vote or to stand for  election - \r\n\r\nwould frighten the Malays in the Federation.  If\r\n\r\nI  were a Malay, I would appreciate it better. I\r\n\r\nask my fellow Members who are not Malays to look\r\n\r\nat  it from the view-point of the Malays, to  be\r\n\r\nfair.  It  is  like saying we  want  to  have  a\r\n\r\nconfederation with more liberty for  the  State,\r\n\r\nyet we want the right for one arm to go over and\r\n\r\nbe merged with the other arm. Two arms to become\r\n\r\none  arm.  If  you want a choice,  you  have  to\r\n\r\nchoose  one or the other. You want more liberty,\r\n\r\nthen  there is the confederation. You want  less\r\n\r\nliberty  for  the  State,  then  that   is   the\r\n\r\nfederation status.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewed, however, from the Chinese side in\r\n\r\nSingapore, the Barisan Sosialis type of  partial\r\n\r\nmerger is wonderful. We want everything. We want\r\n\r\nfreedom  and  we  want  the  right  to  have   a\r\n\r\nmajority. If we are indifferent to the  feelings\r\n\r\nof  the  Malays, then we will say, yes, that  is\r\n\r\nthe  type  of partial merger we want. But  I  am\r\n\r\nsure,  having  lived in Malaya so long,  we  are\r\n\r\nappreciative of the fears and resentments of our\r\n\r\nMalay friends and brethren. If we are trying  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  new nation, we should be fair-minded\r\n\r\nand  not arouse unnecessarily in them more fears\r\n\r\nand   suspicions.  If  we  do  that,  then   the\r\n\r\nconfederation type is the best for everybody.  I\r\n\r\nhave said, Sir, that after 5 years we can review\r\n\r\nthe  position. Supposing we say that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis insists and we all vote for the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  amendment that there must be automatic\r\n\r\nconversion  of Singapore citizens to  Federation\r\n\r\ncitizen  nationals, and not only  that,  but  we\r\n\r\nalso  must  have  the right to go  over  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation and vote and stand for election, then\r\n\r\nwe  know the answer. It will be no. We may  like\r\n\r\nit  in  Singapore, but from the Federation  side\r\n\r\nthe  answer  will be no. That being so,  we  are\r\n\r\nthen forced to go back to the status quo.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nHere,  Sir,  there are two groups of people  who\r\n\r\nmight   favour  the  status  quo.  The   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have said that they are willing to have\r\n\r\nself-government   with  the  Internal   Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  removed.  But,  Sir,  we  can  see  the\r\n\r\ndangers  here. If the internal Security  Council\r\n\r\nis removed, we might become an East Berlin where\r\n\r\nthere will be even less freedom than now. On the\r\n\r\nother hand, I think there are a small number  of\r\n\r\npeople  who  are dreaming of the time  when  the\r\n\r\nBritish  will  scrap the Constitution  and  they\r\n\r\nwill  go  back to the colonial status.  If  they\r\n\r\nwant  that,  I  think  they are  dreamers.  They\r\n\r\ncannot  turn the clock back. In order to  awaken\r\n\r\nthem  from their sleep, I would like to  recount\r\n\r\nan  incident  which took place in  Kuala  Lumpur\r\n\r\nsome  six  or seven years back when Sir  General\r\n\r\nTempler - a  man  who should know British  policy - said  (this  is  a paraphrase),  \"Even  if  some\r\n\r\npeople  may want us to stay here longer,  events\r\n\r\nmay  take place outside this country and in  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom which will compel us to hand over\r\n\r\nthe  government to you people. So  for  goodness\r\n\r\nsake, organise yourselves as quickly as possible\r\n\r\nto  take  over  the government.\"  Sir,  when  an\r\n\r\nofficer  of  that calibre gives  advice  to  the\r\n\r\nlocal  people to organise themselves as  quickly\r\n\r\nas  possible  and  be ready  to  take  over  the\r\n\r\ngovernment,  then  I plead with  those  who  are\r\n\r\nstill  sleeping that they must not stand on  the\r\n\r\nside-lines  and allow the country  to  be  taken\r\n\r\nover  by  extremists.  They  must  assume  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities and make sure that democracy is\r\n\r\na success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today we stand at a very important point\r\n\r\non  the road towards nationhood. The past has  a\r\n\r\nlesson  for  us  so that we can build  a  better\r\n\r\nfuture.  In  1946-48, many of us  remember  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  a great deal of communal tension  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the  Federation.  There  was   a\r\n\r\nhartal. The Malays were organising themselves to\r\n\r\nresist. People were keyed up for a big fight.  I\r\n\r\nam  glad  to  say that a spirit of goodwill  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding came to ten top Malay leaders  and\r\n\r\nten  top Chinese leaders, and they met at Johore\r\n\r\nBahru  to discuss the problem. The Malays  said,\r\n\r\n\"We have political power but you have economic\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npower.  If you help us to rise economically,  we\r\n\r\nmust naturally share with you our economic power\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Chinese  and  Malays,  being   the\r\n\r\nlargest  communities,  must  live  together  har\r\n\r\nmoniously  like brothers or we shall never  have\r\n\r\npeace  and  harmony  in this country.\"  In  that\r\n\r\nspirit, I am glad to say, they were able to turn\r\n\r\nthe  course  of  history. Now  people  say  that\r\n\r\nMalaya is an example of racial harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, on this merger issue, we face\r\n\r\nanother  cross-road. I appeal to the leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe   various  communities  in  Singapore,   the\r\n\r\nFederation and even Malaysia, to have  the  same\r\n\r\nspirit  of  goodwill and understanding  and,  in\r\n\r\nthat  spirit, seek to find the best form of poli\r\n\r\ntical  union which will enable us to come closer\r\n\r\nand closer together until\r\n\r\nwe become a united nation. Sir, this takes time.\r\n\r\nSome  want to rush into a united nation at  once\r\n\r\nby  forcing their own brand of merger, but I ask\r\n\r\nthem to consider that if we force the Malays  to\r\n\r\naccept  a  political union on  those  terms,  it\r\n\r\nmight   mean   failure;  whereas   if   we   are\r\n\r\nunderstanding and are prepared to move  forward,\r\n\r\nfirst on the basis of a confederation, and  then\r\n\r\nreconsider the position after five years  to  go\r\n\r\ninto  a  tight federation, we shall be  able  to\r\n\r\nreach  the goal which the Barisan Sosialis  want\r\n\r\nbut  do not quite comprehend - the goal of genuine\r\n\r\nmerger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, in the last few days, Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition, especially those in the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  have  made lengthy  speeches  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of genuine merger.

But in any case, however hard\r\n\r\nthey  try to cover themselves up, they will  be\r\n\r\nshown for what they are.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moving of the amendment by the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis clearly shows what it amount to.  They\r\n\r\npretend  to  be sincere in learning the  Bible,\r\n\r\nbut  all the time they are pretending to  learn\r\n\r\nit.  So this is only a very lame excuse. If the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis have no intention  whatsoever\r\n\r\nof  reflecting the desire of the people in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and Singapore, then  how  can  they\r\n\r\nthink  of  such things as a genuine merger  and\r\n\r\ntheir amendment to the motion? If a person does\r\n\r\nnot want to do good deeds, what is the point of\r\n\r\nasking a priest to pray for him? This behaviour\r\n\r\nof the Barisan Sosialis is significant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday I heard the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Choa  Chu  Kang say - this  is  reported  in\r\n\r\ntoday's   Nanyang  Siang  Pau - that  since   the\r\n\r\ninception of the Barisan Sosialis, it  has  not\r\n\r\nchanged its stand on\r\n\r\nmerger  of  Singapore with the  Federation  and\r\n\r\nthat  its stand will remain the same in future.\r\n\r\nBut if it only wants to express its stand, then\r\n\r\nI  think  it is totally unreliable. We can  see\r\n\r\nfrom  the  speeches of Members of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis that their stand on merger is changing\r\n\r\nall  the time. They can change like the  Monkey\r\n\r\nGod   which  can  change  itself  into  several\r\n\r\nshapes. In a statement reported in the Sin Chew\r\n\r\nJit  Poh  of 30th August, they said that  their\r\n\r\nstand   on   merger  of  Singapore   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation  was  that they  must  have  a  true\r\n\r\nmerger  immediately so that  Singapore  can  go\r\n\r\ninto  the Federation as a State like Penang  or\r\n\r\nMalacca. However, on 2nd September, the  leader\r\n\r\nof   the   Barisan  Sosialis - the  Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown - was  reported in the same  newspaper\r\n\r\nto  have  said  in reply to certain  statements\r\n\r\nmade in this House that he\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nreiterated the stand of the Barisan Sosialis for\r\n\r\na  self-governing  State of Singapore.  He  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  abolition  of the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  should  be achieved  by  1963  so  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  be an internally self-governing\r\n\r\nState.

He said that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis may consider the confederation\r\n\r\nproposal, including the Borneo territories,  but\r\n\r\nit  must  be  one in which there  must  be  full\r\n\r\ninternal  selfgovernment. Therefore, as  I  said\r\n\r\njust now, if the stand of the Party is what  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Choa Chu Kang has said,  then  that\r\n\r\nstand is unreliable.

It is this: I remember the time when  he\r\n\r\nwas in the P.A.P. He obviously agreed to the  ob\r\n\r\njectives and stand of the P.A.P. And because  he\r\n\r\nagreed  to such objectives, he joined us in  our\r\n\r\nstruggle. But how does it come about that he has\r\n\r\nnow  parted from us? Well, mainly it is  because\r\n\r\nhe  wants a stand that is different from that of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. For this reason, he has crossed  the\r\n\r\nFloor to join the Barisan Sosialis opposite. Now\r\n\r\nthat  he is in the Barisan Sosialis, he  is  not\r\n\r\nsure  whether the Barisan Sosialis has  a  clear\r\n\r\nstand.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nAnd  if  this stand is not agreeable to him,  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether he will do anything about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the question of merger, which is\r\n\r\na  reflection  of the desire of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation, we must say  that\r\n\r\nthe  reunification of these two territories  is\r\n\r\ninevitable  because geographically, culturally,\r\n\r\nand  economically, Singapore has all along been\r\n\r\na part of the Federation, and the reunification\r\n\r\nof   these   two   territories   is   therefore\r\n\r\ninevitable. Since 1946 all anti-colonial people\r\n\r\nand  true nationalists have shouted this slogan\r\n\r\nof  reunification, and the P.A.P. has been  one\r\n\r\nof  them. Even as early as 1954 the P.A.P. put\r\n\r\nforward its own objectives, that is, to end the\r\n\r\nrule  of  the  colonialists in order  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  a  democratic, non-Communist,  socialist\r\n\r\nMalaya.  All along, the ideology and spirit  of\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. has  never  deviated  from   such\r\n\r\nobjectives.  All along we have been  struggling\r\n\r\nhonestly and decidedly according to our  stand,\r\n\r\ni.e. to  lead  the  people  forward  in   the\r\n\r\nachievement  of  a  democratic,  non-Communist,\r\n\r\nsocialist  Malaya. And it is  because  of  this\r\n\r\ncorrect stand of ours that we have been able to\r\n\r\nget  the  support  of  the various  classes  of\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Barisan Socialis Members opposite\r\n\r\nsay that the question of merger today is a sort\r\n\r\nof  trick played by the P.A.P. in the past  few\r\n\r\nmonths in order to save its precarious position\r\n\r\nin  power.  They say that since the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nassumed power, there has been little or no talk\r\n\r\nat  all about this matter. As a matter of fact,\r\n\r\nin  our  policy speech as reported in a booklet\r\n\r\npublished in 1960 by the Editorial Board of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,    we    said    this-regarding     the\r\n\r\nconstitutional talks with the British on merger\r\n\r\nbetween the Federation and Singapore, \"We  must\r\n\r\nreiterate  the  stand  of  the  P.A.P.  We  are\r\n\r\nstanding  firm on our stand. If we do not  have\r\n\r\nsufficient  force or strength  and  ability  to\r\n\r\ncarry out our policy and get the support of the\r\n\r\npeople, then we shall fail.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this booklet, there is yet another\r\n\r\nparagraph  which touches on this.  Some  people\r\n\r\nthink  that Singapore can become an independent\r\n\r\nState by itself.

At  that  time  the\r\n\r\nquestion  was  whether  it  was  practical   for\r\n\r\nSingapore to get independence. Or whether it was\r\n\r\nproper for Singapore to get independence through\r\n\r\nmerger  with  the  Federation,  which  meant   a\r\n\r\ngreater   unity,  viz, from  a  merger  between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the Federation, Singapore  could\r\n\r\nget  its independence. And because this question\r\n\r\nwas brought up during the by-election in Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar,  our representative was returned.  So  it\r\n\r\nwould  be incorrect to say that we never  talked\r\n\r\nabout  the  question of merger in the  past  few\r\n\r\nyears. As a matter of fact, merger is one of the\r\n\r\nobjectives of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the propaganda line of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  is  not  well  defined.  They\r\n\r\ncannot,  on  the one hand, disregard  the  clean\r\n\r\nrecord of the P.A.P. over a period of some seven\r\n\r\nyears, and on the other hand, accuse us of being\r\n\r\nunreasonable in trying to sell out  the  people.\r\n\r\nAs  a  matter of fact, I say that those who  say\r\n\r\nthis are themselves unreasonable. They tried  in\r\n\r\nthe past to overthrow the P.A.P. Government. The\r\n\r\nsituation actually became clear during the Anson\r\n\r\nby-election.  At  that time  the  so-called  six\r\n\r\ntrade  union  leaders in Singapore  published  a\r\n\r\nstatement  against the objectives of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthat  is,  that  we  should have  a  truly  full\r\n\r\ninternal  self-governing State of  Singapore  by\r\n\r\n1963.  And  before the by-election,  our  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister reiterated the objectives of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  struggle, namely, to go  through  with\r\n\r\nmerger  with  the Federation and  to  achieve  a\r\n\r\nfully  independent Singapore. On the 13th  June,\r\n\r\nthe six trade union leaders of the P.A.P. issued\r\n\r\na  statement in which they repeated their desire\r\n\r\nto  have a full internal self-governing State of\r\n\r\nSingapore.

Eight Members who broke  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  P.A.P. published a statement  in  the\r\n\r\npapers  saying that they endorsed the  proposals\r\n\r\nbrought up by the six trade unions leaders, i.e.\r\n\r\nto  have  a truly full self-governing  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore by 1963 through constitutional talks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of order.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!--Mr John Mammen(Deputy Speaker)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b>  Point of\r\n\r\norder.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  may  I ask what paper  is  the  Member\r\n\r\nholding and where she has got it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the hon.

They maintained their stand that they  had\r\n\r\nbroken  away from the P.A.P. At that  time  they\r\n\r\nthought  that by overthrowing the P.A.P. itself\r\n\r\nand  the Government they could continue on their\r\n\r\npath  to  sell  the Government  to  prevent  the\r\n\r\ncoming  into being of merger. They thought  that\r\n\r\nby doing this they could still maintain the open\r\n\r\nfront  of the Communists and their influence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This ambition of theirs  has  failed\r\n\r\nbadly.  Therefore, they are now sitting opposite\r\n\r\nus  and  are travelling in a different way.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Members sitting in this  House\r\n\r\nhave,  by  delivering lengthy speeches in  these\r\n\r\nfew days, become the puppets of the Communists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formerly, when we were happily together within\r\n\r\nthe  Party,  I had occasion to know or  to  hear\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member  for Queenstown  said  certain\r\n\r\nthings to the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nPrime Minister and the Minister for Finance.  He\r\n\r\nsaid that it did not matter if we could make use\r\n\r\nof  the co-operation between the Communists  and\r\n\r\nourselves  as long as the British did  not  lose\r\n\r\ntheir base in Singapore. He also said that  they\r\n\r\ndid  not mind being mouth-pieces. But this is  a\r\n\r\nsort of gamble. I believe that of the gambles in\r\n\r\nwhich  they have been involved, this one is  the\r\n\r\nmost  precarious and dangerous. If at that  time\r\n\r\nwe had followed the suggestion of the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  and had made use of the co-operation\r\n\r\nof the Communists and received instructions from\r\n\r\nthem  to  achieve the abolition of the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council by 1963 so as to have  a  fully\r\n\r\nself-governing Singapore, then I  believe  today\r\n\r\nwe  would  still have been quite happy  together\r\n\r\nsitting on the same side of the House. Then they\r\n\r\nwould  not have left the P.A.P. But we  did  not\r\n\r\nwant to do what they had suggested. We felt that\r\n\r\nif  we  were  to do what they had suggested,  we\r\n\r\nwould only weaken the relationship between Singa\r\n\r\npore  and the Federation. Can they say  that  we\r\n\r\nare not complying with the desire of the people?\r\n\r\nThe  people want a merger of Singapore with  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  But  not the Communists.  The  main\r\n\r\nreason  for this is that they want Singapore  to\r\n\r\nbe  out of the control of the Federation so that\r\n\r\nthey  can make use of Singapore to liberate  the\r\n\r\nFederation. But we must try to achieve a  merger\r\n\r\nof Singapore with the Federation so that it will\r\n\r\ncome as early as possible in order to solve  our\r\n\r\neconomic problems. This will be conducive to the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people. This stand of  ours  is\r\n\r\njust  the opposite of their stand. Since we have\r\n\r\ndifferent objectives, we must part -company.  On\r\n\r\nour  side, we must continue to do our  work  and\r\n\r\nachieve merger. The Communists may go ahead with\r\n\r\ntheir struggle for a fully self-governing State.\r\n\r\nWe wish them well. In any case, how can they say\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  unreasonable? Well,  it  is  very\r\n\r\nsimple.  In the past, because we all  wanted  to\r\n\r\nachieve  a  common objective, namely, to  defeat\r\n\r\nBritish colonialism, they came to our side to co-operate   with  us.  But  now  this   artificial\r\n\r\nseparation is coming to an ,end very soon.

Is it because we\r\n\r\ndo  not want to allow them to go their own  way\r\n\r\nto  sour the relationship between Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe   Federation?   Can   they   say   we   are\r\n\r\nunreasonable in not allowing them to do  things\r\n\r\ntheir  own way? We can tell them now that,  for\r\n\r\nthe  sake  of  achieving the  reunification  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation we are prepared to\r\n\r\nface any attack.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second method of the Barisan Sosialis is\r\n\r\nthis.  They  say that by trying to bring  about\r\n\r\nmerger we are trying to sell out the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. I want to ask them this. In what way\r\n\r\nis  the  P.A.P. selling out Singapore,  and  to\r\n\r\nwhom?  Is  the P.A.P. selling out Singapore  to\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\nBritish,  or  to  the  Japanese,  or   to   the\r\n\r\nAmericans?  They are really more naive  than  a\r\n\r\nchild.  Mr Deputy Speaker, let me quote  again\r\n\r\nin   this   House   the  former   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to the Prime Minister,  who  is  the\r\n\r\npresent Member for Upper Serangoon. At one time\r\n\r\nhe  was  reported in the Nanyang Siang  Pau  of\r\n\r\n13th July to have said this. This statement was\r\n\r\nmade  after the Anson by-election. He said  that\r\n\r\nduring  the by-election, people were  talking  a\r\n\r\ngreat deal about the Malaysia and merger plans.\r\n\r\nI want to remind Members of this House that the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister had said this at a street corner\r\n\r\nmeeting, i.e.,\r\n\r\nthat this question was to be decided finally by\r\n\r\nthe  people  themselves because it  was  not  a\r\n\r\nmatter  for only a few Ministers. The statement\r\n\r\nof  the  Prime Minister is still in the papers.\r\n\r\nSince the Prime Minister has already said  such\r\n\r\na  thing,  why  should Members of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis come to this House and shout that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is selling out the people of Singapore?\r\n\r\nThey  come  here every day and start  shouting.\r\n\r\nThe  people in Singapore and the Federation are\r\n\r\nafter  all  in the same family. They will  come\r\n\r\ntogether  again.  We are now  trying  to  bring\r\n\r\nSingapore back to the bosom\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nof the Federation. I feel that it is but natural\r\n\r\nand  reasonable.  I  say  that  it  is  also  in\r\n\r\nconformity  with the geographical and  historial\r\n\r\nconditions of these two territories. After  all,\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore are part and parcel  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation people. The merger arrangement is\r\n\r\njust  like  the  handling over of  the  domestic\r\n\r\nchores of a younger brother to an elder brother.\r\n\r\nI  do not see anything wrong in that. So how can\r\n\r\nthey  say  that  we are selling  out  Singapore?\r\n\r\nPerhaps their accusations have come about purely\r\n\r\nbecause  the Federation Government is  a  Right-wing  Government and maybe it is because of this\r\n\r\nthey  say  that we are trying to  sell  out  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore to the Tunku. Well, can  we\r\n\r\nsay   that   the  Tunku's  Government   is   not\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of  the Federation  people?  The\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis' logic is very unreasonable and\r\n\r\nirrational. They even talked contradictorily  on\r\n\r\ntheir own amendment. As the Leader of the House,\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister, has said, and rightly\r\n\r\nso, the amendment brought forward by the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  is just like kicking somebody  in  the\r\n\r\nback and then shaking hands with him, and asking\r\n\r\nhim, \"Well, are you all right?\" They do not want\r\n\r\nto  clarify the true situation before they  make\r\n\r\ntheir  accusations which cannot be substantiated\r\n\r\nby  facts. If there is actually a sell out, then\r\n\r\nthe  people's interests in Singapore would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  injured or damaged; but according  to  our\r\n\r\nmerger proposals, the interests of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore will not be damaged in any way at all.\r\n\r\nThe  people  of Singapore will not  only  retain\r\n\r\ntheir   citizenship,  but   will   also   obtain\r\n\r\nnationality  in  the  new  Federation.  And   on\r\n\r\nquestions  such  as  labour,  education,  social\r\n\r\nwelfare  and  the entrepot status of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthey  will  still be what they are, that  is  to\r\n\r\nsay,  these  subjects will still remain  in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  the  Singapore Government.  The  only\r\n\r\ndifference is this. We are now carrying  British\r\n\r\npassports.  In  future, British  passports  will\r\n\r\nturn  into Federation of Malaya passports. These\r\n\r\nrights cannot be had in the other States in  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nopposite, when making his speech on merger, did\r\n\r\nnot have the guts to deny that we are going  to\r\n\r\nhave  special rights. In this case, he  was  at\r\n\r\nleast  a little more frank than the Members  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis. The Barisan Sosialis,  on\r\n\r\nthe  one hand, advocate genuine merger, but  on\r\n\r\nthe other hand, are afraid of internal security\r\n\r\nbeing handed over to the Federation Government.\r\n\r\nTherefore, their amendment about the  so-called\r\n\r\ngenuine merger and the automatic conversion  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship is nothing but a smokescreen and  a\r\n\r\ncamouflage. Their method is just like  the  Cow\r\n\r\nKing  in  Chinese mythology who was  trying  to\r\n\r\nstop  the  Monkey  God  from  climbing  over  a\r\n\r\ncertain  mountain. They have done so  many  for\r\n\r\nthe  interests of a few people in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. Their act cannot cover their  attempt\r\n\r\nand  intention to prevent a merger of Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation. Because of this,  I  come\r\n\r\nforward to oppose strongly the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I go to the\r\n\r\nquestion  proper, I would crave your indulgence\r\n\r\nto express my personal feelings on the -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b> Is it a\r\n\r\npoint of order?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Is the Member allowed to\r\n\r\ngive  her  impressions of what has happened  in\r\n\r\nthe  past few days, instead of going direct  to\r\n\r\nthe point?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> It is not a point of\r\n\r\norder.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, since the tabling of this motion\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister for Labour, there  have  been\r\n\r\ncertain unfortunate events in Singapore.

The people  are\r\n\r\nalso  saying  that the Barisan Sosialis  Members\r\n\r\nare  very right in what they say, especially  on\r\n\r\nthe  citizenship  question. Mr Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this  is a factual reflection.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nlying in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very surprised\r\n\r\nbecause all of a sudden the P.A.P. seems  to  be\r\n\r\ninterested in merger. But the P.A.P. is actually\r\n\r\ninterested  in a phoney merger and  not  a  true\r\n\r\nmerger. They do not support our amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all the people in\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  Singapore have a common but  tragic\r\n\r\nhistory.  The  British colonialists  are  to  be\r\n\r\nblamed  for  the  artificial separation  between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the Federation, otherwise  there\r\n\r\nwould  not  have  been  this  need  now  for   a\r\n\r\nreunification of the two territories. The aim of\r\n\r\nall  patriots  is to break down this  artificial\r\n\r\nbarrier,  because the reunification of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories will bring about greater  democratic\r\n\r\nrights  to  the  people and  prosperity  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry. Therefore, we hope that our territories\r\n\r\nwill come together again as soon as\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npossible.  Since we have made a  beginning  on\r\n\r\nmerger,  we must sit round the table and  talk\r\n\r\nabout  it  amongst ourselves. This  Government\r\n\r\nshould  not go and talk about it with somebody\r\n\r\nelse  and then come to this House to  tell  us\r\n\r\nthat we must accept their merger proposals. It\r\n\r\nwas  because  of this that we  have  moved  an\r\n\r\namendment to the motion. Our amendment is just\r\n\r\nlike  a ship with a compass sailing to a  true\r\n\r\nmerger so that we will not be misled and  lose\r\n\r\nour  way. In this way, some 600,000 people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore will not be brought to the edge of a\r\n\r\ncliff.  This  is  one of the reasons  for  the\r\n\r\namendment  to  the motion. Another  reason  is\r\n\r\nthat we have completely lost our confidence in\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government. Since the  Government\r\n\r\ncame  into  power, it has done many things  to\r\n\r\nthe  disappointment of the people.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nentrust   the  question  of  merger  and   the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the people of Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\nhands of the P.A.P. Government alone. We  want\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P.  Government  to  give   a   clear\r\n\r\nexplanation  to  us  and  to  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore so that we can then have a chance to\r\n\r\ndecide for ourselves, otherwise the Government\r\n\r\nhas  no  right  to  represent  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore on the question of merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel that our\r\n\r\namendment  is  just like a  mirror  which  can\r\n\r\nreflect  the  reactionary  appearance  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  By means of this mirror,  we  can\r\n\r\nreally tell who is interested in a true merger\r\n\r\nand who is interested in a phoney merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will not try to play up  communal\r\n\r\nfeelings,  because communal feelings,  hatred\r\n\r\nand   conflicts  are  very  unfortunate   and\r\n\r\ntragic. This will do nobody any good,  either\r\n\r\nto  the  country  or to the  people.  If  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. resort  to  such dangerous  means  in\r\n\r\norder to save their political career, then  I\r\n\r\nadvise  them not to do it. I hope the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  will think carefully before  they\r\n\r\ndisregard my advice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope out friends\r\n\r\nin  U.M.N.O. know the true situation so  that\r\n\r\nwe can still maintain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nour  friendship  with them. As  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  has  said, we have not made any  personal\r\n\r\nattack on the Tunku. We do not have any communal\r\n\r\ndiscrimination.  All along we have  been  living\r\n\r\ntogether. So let us be calm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nrefute  a  statement  made  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill.   He  said  that  the  amendment   is\r\n\r\nredundant  and  repetitive. I  feel  it  is  not\r\n\r\nredundant  at all. I say it is very appropriate.\r\n\r\nIt can be likened to this. When you go to a cold\r\n\r\ncountry, you must bring more clothes with you to\r\n\r\nkeep  yourself  warm so that  you  will  not  be\r\n\r\nfrozen.  This can also be likened to people  who\r\n\r\nhave to put on glasses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this. The Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  has said that some people are  afraid\r\n\r\nof  internal security falling into the hands  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government. I will say that he is\r\n\r\nnot  correct.  If we have true  merger,  we  are\r\n\r\nprepared   to  accept  that.  The   Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  seems  to  be  on  the  side  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment by defending them on a false premise.\r\n\r\nSo I must quote the Member for Cairnhill - this is\r\n\r\nreported  in  the  Sin  Chew  Jit  Poh  of  23rd\r\n\r\nNovember  this  year. The Member for  Cairnhill,\r\n\r\ntalking  about  some people's fear  of  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity    falling    into    the    Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment's  hands, is reported  to  have  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  Federation Government, after  merger,\r\n\r\nmight take action on behalf of the P.A.P. Govern\r\n\r\nment.  He says that this will not happen because\r\n\r\nat  present the Internal Security Council has  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the Federation  who  does  not\r\n\r\ninterfere   with  or  instruct   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  to do this or to do that.  This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  the  position for the past two years,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore, we should not fear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us say that this\r\n\r\nis true. Therefore, if we have no claim to make,\r\n\r\nthen  there should not be any opposition.  If  a\r\n\r\nchild is good and well behaved, there is no need\r\n\r\nto  punish him. But the fact does not seem to be\r\n\r\nlike  this.  Very often we hear  the  Government\r\n\r\nclaiming that the Internal Security Council  has\r\n\r\ngiven   the   Government  a  lot   of   trouble,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  respect  of  the  release   of\r\n\r\npolitical detainees. The Government say they\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhave  tried  to  argue  this  question  in  the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security Council, but in vain.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know what is the actual voting which makes\r\n\r\ntheir attempt fail. The assurance of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill seems to have come from  nowhere\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is  not a member of  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council. So I am just wondering how he\r\n\r\ngot this information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me talk about the\r\n\r\nspeech of the Minister for Culture. He is a man\r\n\r\nwith the \"Ah Q\" spirit. From his speech, we can\r\n\r\nsee  that  these words prey on his  mind,  \"The\r\n\r\nFirst Prime Minister of Malaysia\". He is trying\r\n\r\nto distort the fact that the people should have\r\n\r\nmore  democratic rights. He tries to  say  that\r\n\r\nMembers of the Barisan Sosialis use this  right\r\n\r\nof  the people to gain more constituencies.  He\r\n\r\ndisregards  the  problem that  comes  with  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in constituencies, i.e.,  the  people\r\n\r\nmust  have more democratic rights after  merger\r\n\r\nso that they will be able to move freely in the\r\n\r\neleven States in the Federation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me quote the Minister for Culture. He\r\n\r\nsaid, \"It is only when people in the Federation\r\n\r\nhave  more favourable terms than the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore    that   this   term   \"second-class\r\n\r\ncitizenship\"  can be established.  That  is  to\r\n\r\nsay,  people  in the Federation  can  come  and\r\n\r\nstand  for election in Singapore, but those  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   cannot  go  there  and  stand   for\r\n\r\nelection, i.e. to enjoy the same rights, and it\r\n\r\nis  only  when such a position has  come  about\r\n\r\nthat  this term \"second-class citizenship\"  can\r\n\r\nbe  said  to  be  true and  correct.  There  is\r\n\r\nequality only when the people can enjoy  common\r\n\r\nrights.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from this part of his\r\n\r\nspeech,  we can say that the term \"second-class\r\n\r\ncitizenship\"    is   true;   because    in    a\r\n\r\nreunification, the people must be able to enjoy\r\n\r\nequal  rights. But how is it that after merger,\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore are confined  only  to\r\n\r\nthe small island of Singapore and the people in\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  are  confined  to  their  own\r\n\r\nterritory  in Malaya? If that is the case,  how\r\n\r\ncould  you  have  merger,  and  where  is   the\r\n\r\nreunification? I must point out  in  particular\r\n\r\nthat  after merger Singapore citizens can enjoy\r\n\r\ncivic rights within the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nState  of Singapore only, but the people in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  can enjoy civic rights  in  all  the\r\n\r\neleven States. So it is very correct for  us  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  after merger Singapore  citizens  are\r\n\r\nsecond-class  citizens. Can we ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Culture with the \"Ah Q\" spirit to explain -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on a\r\n\r\npoint of elucidation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b> resumed her seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Is she saying that I have the\r\n\r\n\"I.
