If he continues to be employed, CPF contributions must be paid \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> for him.

The Ministry is gathering information on the matter. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the evidence shows that CPF contributions are a hindrance to the employment of older workers, the Ministry will consider reducing or abolishing CPF contributions for such workers. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Sir, this is not a supplementary question but a point of clarification.

Subsequent to that, he can withdraw once in every five years. But if he stops work, then he can withdraw six months after he has stopped work. I thought that is clear enough. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> What happens after the five years?

This would involve studies of CPF data as well as representations or interviews with employers and employees' unions; all kinds of evidence that can support a conclusion either way, whether CPF in fact is a hindrance, whether it is a disincentive to older people working. If the Member can suggest other ways in which this can be proved, he is welcome to do so. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, is the Minister not aware that if a simple question were to be put to employers that, \"Is the CPF a hindrance to your employing a person older than 55 years?\" the answer is going to be yes?

Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under section 13(3) of the Central Provident Fund Act the CPF savings of an undischarged bankrupt are deemed to be impressed with a trust in favour of the persons entitled to the savings upon his death. The purpose of this provision is to protect the savings of the undischarged bankrupt from seizure by his creditors. Such protection is in the interest of persons entitled to the savings upon the death of the undischarged bankrupt. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this provision an undischarged bankrupt has not been allowed to withdraw his contributions. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under section 44(2) of the Housing and Development Act, a flat purchased by an undischarged bankrupt is protected from seizure by the official assignee to satisfy creditors. The same protection is afforded by section 41 (2) of the Jurong Town Corporation Act for JTC flats purchased by an undischarged bankrupt. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is this specific protection from seizure of an HDB or JTC flat, the Government will be amending section 13(3) of the Central Provident Fund Act to allow an undischarged bankrupt to use his CPF savings to purchase such a flat. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the undischarged bankrupt sell his HDB or JTC flat, he is required to return to the CPF the savings withdrawn with interest, or the proceeds of the sale, whichever is less. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of November 1979 a total of 69 CPF members who are undischarged bankrupts have not been allowed to withdraw their savings to buy HDB or JTC flats. They will be allowed to do so when the amendment is passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>HAWKER LICENCES FOR</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>RESETTLED FARMERS</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for the Environment if he will consider allocating hawker stalls to licensed farmers who are affected by resettlement. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, markets and food centres are built essentially to resite licensed street hawkers.

Following the Ministerial Statement on the Singapore Administrative Service in Parliament on 15 May 1979, a Professional Services Review Committee was constituted to examine the pay and career advancement prospects in the professional and equivalent services in the Singapore Civil Service. For record purposes, I am placing on the Table an Annex (Cols. 529 - 530) to my statement which gives the composition and terms of reference of the Committee. The Committee submitted its Report to Cabinet on 8 October 1979. I will dwell only on the major recommendations of the Committee. \n  <br> \n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1979/19791211/19791211-HA-0390529.htm\">Annex - COMPOSITION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE COMMITTEE (Cols. 529 - 530)</a> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Purview of the Committee</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Committee reviewed only those services which meet the definition of \"professional and equivalent services\". These are services which are comparable to the Administrative Service in two respects: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Appointment is confined to candidates with either a good Honours degree (First Class or Second Class Upper) or a professional qualification; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Their existing salary structure is similar to that for the pre-revised Administrative Service. These services are the Dental, Engineering, Medical and Legal Services and the senior echelons of the Accounting, Audit, Civil Aviation, Computer, Education, Foreign, Inland Revenue, Management Services, Meteorological, Parks and Recreation, Planning, Primary Production, Scientific, Statistics and Survey Services. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The uniformed services are not included by the terms of reference. The Government places the highest priority on the recruitment and retention of high calibre officers for the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Police. The Ministry of Finance will, in consultation with the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Home Affairs, review the pay and promotion prospects of senior echelons of the uniformed services so that the pay schemes will be equal to, and the promotion prospects better than, those for the professional services or the Administrative Service. This will enable the SAF and the Police to recruit and retain some of the best of each year's crop of scholars. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Principles of Review and Recommendations</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. In its review of the professional and equivalent services the Committee adopted the following general principles: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Administrative Service will remain the premier service in the Civil Service: and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The time-tested pattern of internal relativities existing between the various services should not be disturbed, unless adjustment is compelled by a wide salary gap between a particular service and its analogous profession in the private sector. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Committee concludes that, except for the Medical and Legal Services, the earnings of most officers in the Government professional services are comparable to their counterparts in the private sector. No salary revision for these services was necessary. Instead, the Committee recommends measures which will assist the recruitment and retention of able officers in these services. These measures also apply to the Medical and Legal Services. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. I shall describe these measures. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Career Opportunities for Professionals</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Professionals in the Civil Service should have career prospects comparable to those of their colleagues who opt for the private sector. Their promotion will be faster than in the past, determined by their own ability and contribution to the performance of their services, and by the rate of progress of their peers in the private sector. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Early Promotion of Bright Young Recruits</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. To facilitate early promotion of bright young recruits a Timescale Intermediate Grade similar to the Senior Administrative Assistant Grade ($1640x65A-1835/ \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> 1900x65A-2420) will be introduced for all the professional services. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Promotion Prospects for All Professionals</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. To improve the promotion prospects of all professionals in Government Service: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) full-scale promotion exercises will be held at least once in every two years; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) there will be an annual review when the respective Appointing Authority and Head of Department (or Permanent Secretary) concerned take the initiative to identify deserving officers for promotion outside the normal promotion exercises; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) officers away on study leave or official duty overseas will be considered during promotion exercises; their promotion will not be jeopardised because they cannot be interviewed by the Public Service Commission; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the practice of promotion on trial will be discontinued. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Top Grades for Outstanding Professionals</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Every professional service must have a few outstanding officers in charge, if its performance is to be maintained and improved upon. Our aim is to attract and retain able and dedicated officers by faster promotion. The outstanding few will be able to proceed beyond their present topmost grades. Therefore: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Outstanding officers in the professional services can be promoted on a personal-to-holder basis to Superscale A. In the Education, Engineering (PWD), Foreign, Inland Revenue, Legal and Medical Services where the existing topmost grade is Superscale C. one outstanding professional from each of these services at any one time can be promoted beyond Superscale A to the Staff Grades. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in addition to the above advancement opportunities: \n  <pre>\r\n     (i) outstanding professionals with\r\n         proven administrative ability can be\r\n         absorbed into the Administrative\r\n         Service; and\r\n    (ii) suitable professionals can be\r\n         transferred to university\r\n         appointments to further their\r\n</pre> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <pre>\r\n         careers, without loss of their\r\n         accrued Civil Service pension\r\n         benefits.\r\n</pre> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Other Terms and Conditions of Service</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. The Government accepts the Committee's view that other terms and conditions of service in the Civil Service should, given the nature of salaried employment in a large bureaucracy, be comparable to employment in the private sector. It cannot, however, reproduce the same individual variations of private practice for professionals, which penalises the unfortunate mercilessly and rewards the lucky few fabulously. Improvements have been made recently to the leave, car loan and housing loan schemes. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Finance will consider the following further improvements: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) extending the repayment period for housing loans from 20 to 25 years so that the maximum quantum of housing loan can be increased from four to five times that of an officer's annual salary; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) paying pension benefits to the dependants of a pensionable officer for a reasonable period in the event of his death in harness after serving a minimum number of years. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Recommendations Specific to the Legal, Medical, Dental and Education Services</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Of the professional services in Government, the Medical, Dental and Legal Services experience the greatest difficulty in retaining staff because of the higher earnings of similar professionals in private practice. The Committee has, therefore, made special recommendations for the Legal, and Medical and Dental Services. \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <h4></h4> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. For the Legal Service a scheme of special non-pensionable allowances will be introduced. These allowances will narrow the gap in earnings between lawyers in the private and public sectors. They will be paid on a personal-to-holder basis and will be reviewed from time to time to take into account the gap in earnings between lawyers in the two sectors. These allowances will be payable as follows: \n  <pre>\r\n   Upper Timescale                   $250 pm\r\n   Superscale H                      $500 pm\r\n</pre> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <pre>\r\n   Superscale G                      $750 pm\r\n   Superscale F                    $1,000 pm\r\n   Superscale E                    $1,250 pm\r\n   Superscale D                    $1,500 pm\r\n   Superscale C                    $2,000 pm\r\n   Superscale B                    $2,500 pm\r\n   Superscale A                    $3,000 pm\r\n</pre> No allowances will be payable to Legal Officers in the Staff Grades. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. The Chief Justice, the Attorney-General and the High Court Judges are outside the Legal Service. They are not subject to the ceiling of Superscale A. These appointments represent additional avenues available to members of the Legal Service to advance beyond Superscale A. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. For Medical and Dental Services a new Consultation Fees Scheme will allow consultants to choose between retaining consultation fees up to 60% of their consolidated salary or continue their existing fixed specialist allowances. This should retain enough consultants in the Government Service despite the current financial pull of private practice. These allowances or fees, however, will not be paid to Medical and Dental Officers in Staff Grades. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. As for the Education Service the Committee found that a further revision was unnecessary since the recently revised salaries for this service are in line with the Committee's recommendations for professional services. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Future Salary Review</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. Salaries in the professional services will be reviewed after each review of Administrative Service to take into account Singapore's economic growth and the comparable opportunities and pay levels in the private sector. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Conclusion</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. Finally, I must point out that the primacy of the Singapore Administrative Service is the bedrock of Government policy. The pre-eminence of this Service is in the role of Administrative Officers and will be reflected in their greater number in Staff Grades. The outstanding and the exceptional in the professional services will also retain \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> their relative lustre because those with the qualities comparable to the best in Administrative Service can aspire to the new Staff Grades. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4> \n  </div> \n  <br>3.06 p.m. \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>PRIVATE HOSPITALS AND</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>MEDICAL CLINICS BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to provide for the control, licensing and inspection of private hospitals, medical clinics and clinical laboratories, to prohibit trading in human blood, and for purposes connected therewith, and to repeal the Nursing Homes and Maternity Homes Registration Act (Chapter 163 of the Revised Edition)\", \n  <br> \n  <br>presented by the Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament and to be printed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ARBITRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Arbitration Act (Chapter 16 of the Revised Edition)\", \n  <br> \n  <br>presented by the Minister for Law and Science and Technology (Mr E.W.

The Committee received three written representations. These are shown in Appendix II to the Committee's Report which was presented to the House on 28th November, 1979. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising out of consultations between the Auditor-General, the Attorney-General and the Ministry of Culture, the Select Committee considered and recommended amendments to the financial and auditing provisions contained in clauses 15, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 of the Bill. These amendments, incorporated in the Bill at Appendix I to the Report, will improve the accountability of the Corporation and will ensure that the Corporation complies with standard accounting and auditing procedures for statutory boards. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the three written representations received, two identical memoranda submitted by the Association of Accredited Advertising Agents and the Singapore Advertisers Association proposed that their Chairman be appointed as members of the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation. It is inadvisable to specify in the Act who should sit on the Board. At present there is a good working relationship between the two advertising associations and the Commercial Section of RTS. I have no doubt that this relationship will continue when the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation has been established. However, should there be a need for the appointment of a member representing the advertisers, this could be considered in due course. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third written representation was submitted by the Tamils Representative Council, which suggested amendments to the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation Bill, seeking appointment of representatives of the three major racial groups as members of the Corporation, as well as to ensure that sufficient air time was given to the different language programmes. The Tamils Representative Council feared that when the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation was established as a commercial enterprise, and had to generate sufficient income to sustain itself through sale of air time, Indian programmes would suffer because they did not have a large enough viewership to make them commercially viable. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the anxiety of the Indian community; but such anxiety is unfounded. It has always been the Government's policy to provide air time for different language programmes. This policy will not change after \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the establishment of the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation. As I had informed the House during the Second Reading of this Bill, the Government will retain control over the policy of the Corporation in the pub!ic interest. While there may be adjustments to improve the presentation and quality of programmes, I can assure the Indian and other minority communities that the quantum of air time they are having now on television will not be reduced. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>PLANNING (AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.16 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present system of levying development charge for rezoning and for increases in plot ratio and density is based on flat rates. These rates were prescribed in 1965 and are now grossly unrealistic. In addition, the fixed-rate system does not accurately reflect the change in land value arising from rezoning since it does not take into account the original zoning and other factors such as location and accessibility which affect land value. Under the system, development charge is payable on rezoning even though there may be no increase in land value. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to give effect to a new and equitable system of levying development charge. Under the new system, development charge will be at a prescribed percentage of the appreciation in land value or at revised fixed rates, whichever is higher. The percentage to be prescribed, under subsidiary legislation, will be 70%. This valuation method will reflect more accurately the increase in land value. The revised fixed rates are intended to serve as a guide to landowners who wish to submit proposals which require rezoning. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill requires the development charge to be paid only if there is an appreciation in \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the value of the land. It empowers the Chief Valuer, or such other person as the Minister may appoint, to determine the amount of appreciation in the value of the land arising from the g!ant of planning permission which involves rezoning and increases in plot ratio or density. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that appeals shall be submitted within 30 days of the notice of the development charge. An appeal fee which will be prescribed must be paid before an appeal can be considered. The appellant will be allowed to proceed with the development without waiting for the outcome of the appeal, if he pays up the development charge. If the appeal succeeds, the difference between the amount paid and the development charge determined by the Minister shall be refunded to the appellant. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valuation system represents a rational approach to meet the demands for development which require rezoning. It is an equitable system and gives an incentive to the developer who retains 30% of the increase in land value. With the new system, Government will be more flexible when evaluating development proposals which involve rezoning or increases in plot ratio or density, especially in areas which are suitable for rezoning. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Teh Cheang Wan]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ECONOMIC EXPANSION INCENTIVES</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(RELIEF FROM INCOME TAX)</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <h4>(AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</h4> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.20 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Part IV of the present Act, 90% of the qualifying profits of an export enterprise are exempted from income tax for a specified period. The purpose of this incentive is to encourage manufacturing investment to produce for the world markets. The Comptroller of Income Tax's interpretation of section 32 regarding the deduction of capital allowance was, however, challenged in Court by one of the firms given the incentive. This firm considered that the whole of the capital allowance should be deducted against non-qualifying profits and none against qualifying profits, although the plant and machinery for which the incentive is given are used to produce both types of profits. The Comptroller's interpretation was that the capital allowance should be allocated proportionately between the non-qualifying and the qualifying profits. The Comptroller's interpretation reflected the intent of the Government when enacting the legislation in 1967, whereas the firm's interpretation gave it additional tax benefits. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute was first brought before the Courts 10 years ago. The Comptroller's interpretation was upheld in the Board of Review, High Court and Court of Appeal. However, in March 1979, the Privy Council, which is the final tribunal, ruled in favour of the company. While accepting the verdict of the Privy Council in the particular case, the Government has to consider what it should do regarding a decision which gives the affected companies additional benefits against its intention and against an interpretation of the legislation by the Comptroller of Income Tax which has been widely known to investors, particularly because it has been disputed in the Courts. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill is therefore necessary to ensure that in computing the export profit of an export enterprise which qualifies for tax relief provided by section 32 of the Act, such part of the capital allowance as may be attributable to the export profit qualifying for the tax relief must be deducted. The Amendment will come into effect from the year of assessment 1980. The Government's \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> view is that the Amendment does not change the incentives that it is granting or have granted to approved companies. What it does is to correct an imprecision in drafting that has required the full judicial process of 10 years to settle. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has received representations from some companies that the Bill should not apply to those already granted export enterprise certificates, as they claim it undermines the basis on which they agreed to establish manufacturing plants in Singapore. We regret we cannot accede to their request as it was never our intention to grant the additional benefit. However, if it is proven that some were indeed misled by the uncertain wording of the present unamended Act into making investments, and hardship would fall on them by the Amendment, we are prepared to look at their case on an individual basis. I would like to reassure the investment community that the Government does not go back on any explicit commitments made by itself or its agencies. Credibility is the cornerstone of its investment policy and it will continue to demonstrate this. But it cannot be expected to preserve something which its actions through the judicial process show it never intended to give in the first place. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Goh Chok Tong]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment: read a Third Time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" - [Mr E.W.
