Sir, I speak today in particular\r\n\r\nreference to the announcement of the Government a  few\r\n\r\ndays ago regarding the appointment of the President of\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Arbitration Court. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"Court\",  I take it, has been  deliberately\r\n\r\nused  in  the  designation of  this  Court  under  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial   Relations   Ordinance.   It    was    the\r\n\r\nexpectation,  I think, in the country that  the  first\r\n\r\nPresident  would be a person of some legal  experience\r\n\r\nand   qualification.  I  do  not  make  any   personal\r\n\r\nreference to Dr Gamba except that he does not possess\r\n\r\nany  legal qualification or legal experience. The work\r\n\r\nof  this  Industrial Arbitration Court,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, will draw the attention of a very large number of\r\n\r\npeople of this country. It has been stressed time  and\r\n\r\ntime again inside this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse and by both sides of the House that the economic\r\n\r\nsituation  of  this country is a vital factor  in  the\r\n\r\nexistence of the people of this country. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  there  has been much attention focussed  on  the\r\n\r\nindustrial   relationship   between   employers    and\r\n\r\nemployees,  and  we have all been expecting  that  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court would be the final answer\r\n\r\nto  the  numerous  strikes  which  have  plagued  this\r\n\r\ncountry  in the past and, in so plaguing this country,\r\n\r\nhave  disturbed  the equilibrium of the  people  whose\r\n\r\nmain   concern  is  the  betterment  of  the  economic\r\n\r\nsituation of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the work of the Industrial Arbitration Court,\r\n\r\nthere  will no doubt be a great deal of material which\r\n\r\ndoes  not involve the interpretation of law. Now, such\r\n\r\nmaterial,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, would  involve  a  great\r\n\r\nknowledge  of the business of this country. Dr  Gamba\r\n\r\nwas  the  Professor of Economics in the University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya   and,  as  such,  we  naturally  respect   his\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  economics. But he has no experience  of\r\n\r\nthe  day-to-day running of big business, and it is  my\r\n\r\nhumble  submission that a certain amount of  knowledge\r\n\r\nand  experience of big business should be an essential\r\n\r\nqualification  of the Judge sitting in the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court. I fail to see how the new appointee\r\n\r\ncan qualify in that respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the knowledge of law, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do\r\n\r\nnot  need  to  stress before you that it  is  no  easy\r\n\r\nmatter  to  interpret the law, and there  is  a  great\r\n\r\nprinciple  often  quoted in  the  law  courts  in  the\r\n\r\nadministration of law in any country, and that is that\r\n\r\njustice  must  not only be done but must  seem  to  be\r\n\r\ndone.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the appointment should  have\r\n\r\ngone  not  only to a person of great legal experience,\r\n\r\nbut  should also have gone to a person whose  politics\r\n\r\ncannot  be questioned, or, rather, a person who should\r\n\r\nhave no political leanings whatsoever. In the case  of\r\n\r\nthis  new appointee, there may be some question as  to\r\n\r\nhis  political leanings. Therefore, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nit  may  perturb  employers,  particularly  when  they\r\n\r\nappear  before  the Court, which should be  absolutely\r\n\r\nimpartial to both employee and employer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to appear to be\r\n\r\nanticipating the work of this Court, but I hope,  when\r\n\r\na   reply  is  given  to  this  amendment,  that  some\r\n\r\nsatisfactory public statement will be made  to  subdue\r\n\r\nwhatever   qualms  that  may  have  arisen  with   the\r\n\r\nannouncement of the appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.

Byrne):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, if the Member for Joo Chiat had been\r\n\r\npresent  in this House at the time when the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Bill was debated, he would have been able to\r\n\r\ninform himself of the functions of this Court. On that\r\n\r\noccasion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I did take pains to inform\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the House that the Industrial Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt is not a Court of Judicature. It is a Court that\r\n\r\nis  concerned with the making of collective agreements\r\n\r\nbetween employers and unions, its functions are mainly\r\n\r\nlegislative and not judicial. Mr Speaker, Sir, in any\r\n\r\ndispute  where the parties fail to agree, the Minister\r\n\r\ncan, under the provisions of the Ordinance, refer  the\r\n\r\ndispute  to the Industrial Arbitration Court. It  will\r\n\r\nbe  the  function of this Court to make the  agreement\r\n\r\nfor  the  parties when they cannot so agree.  That  is\r\n\r\nessentially  a  legislative process and not,  strictly\r\n\r\nspeaking,  a judicial process. It is for that  reason,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, that it is considered  unnecessary\r\n\r\nthat  the  holder  of  this  appointment  should  hold\r\n\r\naccepted legal qualifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is provision for the\r\n\r\nappointment of a Registrar under the Ordinance. It  is\r\n\r\nour intention to ensure that the person who fills that\r\n\r\nappointment  will hold recognised legal qualifications\r\n\r\nso  that he could assist the President whenever points\r\n\r\nof  legal  difficulty arise. There is  also  provision\r\n\r\nunder the Ordinance for the State Advocate-General  to\r\n\r\nbe  consulted  by  the  Court  when  points  of  legal\r\n\r\ndifficulty  arise; and when he intervenes, members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bar  have the right to appear before  the  Court.\r\n\r\nThere  are two sections of the Ordinance which provide\r\n\r\nthat  members of the Bar no longer have a right,  once\r\n\r\nthis  Ordinance has been brought into force,  to  take\r\n\r\npart in the process of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollective bargaining and members of the Bar also have\r\n\r\nno  right to appear before this Court. I have  pointed\r\n\r\nall that out before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of the political\r\n\r\nleanings  of Dr Charles Gamba who has been  named,  I\r\n\r\ncan  assure the Member for Joo Chiat that he is not  a\r\n\r\nmember  of the People's Action Party. He is  a  person\r\n\r\nwho  has  played a great part in labour  economics  in\r\n\r\nthis  country.  He  has appeared on various  tribunals\r\n\r\ndealing  with labour problems. As the Member  for  Joo\r\n\r\nChiat  must  know, this appointment is under  the  law\r\n\r\nmade  by  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara on the advice  of\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister. And the Prime Minister, before  he\r\n\r\nmade this appointment, was very concerned that he  did\r\n\r\nmake   the   right  choice.  Before   he   made   this\r\n\r\nappointment,   he  consulted  various  employers   and\r\n\r\nsounded out their views, and they indicated that  this\r\n\r\nappointment would be acceptable to them. In  the  same\r\n\r\nway,  he  consulted the Trades Union Congress and  the\r\n\r\nCongress  informed him that this appointment would  be\r\n\r\nacceptable to them. So we are sure, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat this Court will be in the hands of a capable  and\r\n\r\nexperienced person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Joo Chiat wish to\r\n\r\ntake this to a vote?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> No, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member formally beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw his amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $43,070 for Head 34 ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof  the  Third Supplementary Estimates of  Expenditure\r\n\r\nfor 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 40 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is an amendment standing in the\r\n\r\nname of the Member for Joo Chiat in relation to the\r\n\r\nnew subhead (National Day).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 40 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of the new subhead (National Day).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Speaker, Sir, this sum of $52,000 is being asked\r\n\r\nby  the Government to pay for that famous occasion  on\r\n\r\n3rd  June,  when  rain washed away all the  marvellous\r\n\r\npreparations of the Government.

Moreover, the stock of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nequipment, especially in electrical fittings, with the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works  Department,  was  inadequate  for   big\r\n\r\nfestive  occasions of this nature. It is  intended  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a pool of such equipment over a period of  time\r\n\r\nand to make it available to meet all requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$52,000 is an insignificant figure when compared with\r\n\r\nexpenditure for similar events by other countries.  Of\r\n\r\nthe  $52,000, $41,320.80 was spent on decorations.  We\r\n\r\ncould  not  stop the rain. But if there  had  been  no\r\n\r\nrain, the Member for Joo Chiat would have witnessed  a\r\n\r\nperformance by the people of Singapore to glorify  the\r\n\r\nself-government that we have attained, not the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid the Member for Joo Chiat has under-estimated the intelligence of the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nbecause  all  representatives of the  people  and  all\r\n\r\nsections     of    communities    were    represented.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the procession did not take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the $52,000, only $2,403.91 was spent on the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  luncheon which had to go  on  despite  the\r\n\r\nrain. And the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's function at the\r\n\r\nIstana Negara, which was not interrupted by the  rain,\r\n\r\ncost us $2,673.61. If the Member for Joo Chiat thought\r\n\r\nit  was  a good idea to celebrate our self-government,\r\n\r\nthen  he  should not have brought up this  unnecessary\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not questioning the\r\n\r\nnecessity for celebrating National Day, but I wish  to\r\n\r\nraise  two  questions of principle. Mr  Speaker,  you\r\n\r\nwill notice that the National Day celebrations started\r\n\r\non  3rd  June  and ended on 6th June, 1960.  When  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party came into power, they framed  a\r\n\r\nBudget  which  they  presented to this  Assembly;  but\r\n\r\napparently they forgot this particular item  in  their\r\n\r\nBudget.  Having  forgotten it, Sir - perhaps  they  were\r\n\r\nhard pressed in framing that Budget, and I accept what\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance has said, that they had only\r\n\r\na few months in between the framing of the  Budget\r\n\r\nand the actual expenditure of this money - they now come\r\n\r\nto  this  House  to seek its approval to  obtain  this\r\n\r\nmoney which they had spent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point you will observe, Mr Speaker, is that\r\n\r\nthis  sum  has  been advanced out of the Contingencies\r\n\r\nFund. You may remember, Mr Speaker, that when it  was\r\n\r\nqueried in the House as to how the Contingencies  Fund\r\n\r\nwould be used, if I remember rightly, Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\nimpression  I got was that it would only  be  used  on\r\n\r\noccasions  when the Government had to spend  money  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of matters which they could not have foreseen\r\n\r\nbefore   the   actual   time  of   expenditure.   This\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is a matter which I am sure the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  foresaw - they not only foresaw  it,  but\r\n\r\nthey  knew it must happen. Therefore, could I  suggest\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for Finance that in future  an  item\r\n\r\nlike this be covered in the Budget?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I certainly welcome the suggestion\r\n\r\nof   the  Member  for  Farrer  Park,  but  a  word  of\r\n\r\nexplanation may be necessary as to why we adopted  the\r\n\r\nprocedure that we did. Members will know that this  is\r\n\r\nthe  first  occasion that celebrations on  this  scale\r\n\r\nwere  attempted by the present Government, and it  was\r\n\r\nnot  possible to budget in sufficient detail the  cost\r\n\r\nfor   all  the  various  activities  in  advance.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in the course of preparation,  it  was  the\r\n\r\nexperience  of  the  Government  that  more  and  more\r\n\r\nassociations,  groups of people, and  cultural  bodies\r\n\r\nvolunteered  to join in the festivities.  Accordingly,\r\n\r\nit  was  felt that the method of budgeting in  advance\r\n\r\nwould  be  a difficult procedure to comply  with.  But\r\n\r\nwith  the  experience that we have gained, I think  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  possible  to budget  within  fairly  close\r\n\r\nlimits for future occasions of this sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that the Member for Joo Chiat\r\n\r\nwishes to put his amendment to the vote?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $52,000 for Head 40 ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof  the  Third Supplementary Estimates of  Expenditure\r\n\r\nfor 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 46 -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No notice of amendment has been\r\n\r\nreceived in respect thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $117,170 for Head 46 ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof  the  Third Supplementary Estimates of  Expenditure\r\n\r\nfor 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, \"That the sum of $212,240 shall be supplied\r\n\r\nto  the Government under the heads of expenditure  for\r\n\r\nthe  public  services shown in the Third Supplementary\r\n\r\nEstimates of Expenditure for 1960 contained  in  Paper\r\n\r\nCmd. 18 of 1960\", put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution to be reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Fourth Supplementary Estimates of\r\n\r\nExpenditure for 1960 (Paper Cmd. 19 of 1960).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summary is at page 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 22 -\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is an amendment standing in the\r\n\r\nname of the Member for Joo Chiat in relation to\r\n\r\nsubhead 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to proceed\r\n\r\nwith this amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[That the sum to be allocated for Head D 22 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,156,880 for Head D 22 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Fourth Supplementary Estimates of\r\n\r\nExpenditure for 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 48 -\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is an amendment standing in the\r\n\r\nname of the Member for Joo Chiat in relation to item(4) of subhead 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the explanation to this\r\n\r\nHead, the Government has said that this is in order to\r\n\r\nimplement  Government's policy  of  reorganisation  of\r\n\r\nMinistries  and  integration of the City  Council  and\r\n\r\nRural District Councils into Government -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that the Member is moving?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> I beg your pardon.

I  question\r\n\r\nwhether  these  removals were, in fact, necessary.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  if  the costs of such removals were  not  the\r\n\r\nhigh  sum  of  $50,000,  one might  be  a  little  bit\r\n\r\npatient.  But  when there is such a big  sum  to  play\r\n\r\n\"general  post\" within the Government, one  becomes  a\r\n\r\nbit perturbed. The government of this country has been\r\n\r\nevolved  through  decades, and there  have  been  many\r\n\r\ncommissions  of  inquiries into the  working  and  the\r\n\r\nallocation  of  work and the placings of  the  various\r\n\r\nGovernment  offices.  In one  foul  stroke,  this  new\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  ours has started changing  things  all\r\n\r\nround,  quite apart from the headaches the members  of\r\n\r\nthe public have when they want to go to any particular\r\n\r\ndepartment.  We  find  that there  has  not  been  any\r\n\r\nradical  improvement. Where do all these changes  lead\r\n\r\nus to? It is so easy for a new broom to say, \"Well,  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  sweep clean, and I want to change everything\r\n\r\nabout.\"  Well, do  so  by all  means,  but  not,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  contend, at the costly  expense  of\r\n\r\n$50,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to implement the\r\n\r\nGovernment's declared policy of integrating  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  the  Rural  Board  with  the  Government\r\n\r\nMinistries,   and  also  the  need  to  organise   the\r\n\r\nMinistries  themselves, and where possible  group  the\r\n\r\nvarious departments under one Ministry together in one\r\n\r\nbuilding, it was necessary to carry out a programme of\r\n\r\nreallocation  of  office  accommodation  for   various\r\n\r\nGovernment   Ministries  and  departments.   For   the\r\n\r\ninformation  of  the Member for Joo Chiat,  the  major\r\n\r\ndepartmental  re-groupings and reorganisation  are  as\r\n\r\nfollows:  The  Land Office and the  Rural  Board  were\r\n\r\nmoved  from the Upper Pickering Street office  to  the\r\n\r\nground-floor of City Hall, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLand  Office  being  a land-user  department.  The\r\n\r\nRegistry of Titles and the Registry of Deeds  have\r\n\r\nbeen  moved to the ground-floor of the City  Hall,\r\n\r\nwhilst  the  Survey  Department  will  move  there\r\n\r\nshortly. These are also land-user departments. The\r\n\r\nTreasury,  the  Establishment  Office,  the  Audit\r\n\r\nOffice  and  the Accountant-General's Office  have\r\n\r\nbeen  re-grouped  together with  the  Division  of\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry in Fullerton Building.  This\r\n\r\nenables the departments under the Ministry of Home\r\n\r\nAffairs,  including the Immigrant department,  the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of Citizenship, the Registry of  Persons\r\n\r\nand  the Registry of Births and Deaths to  be  re-grouped in Empress Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Engineer's Department and the City\r\n\r\nChief    Architect's   Department   were   earlier\r\n\r\nregrouped   together   with   the   Public   Works\r\n\r\nDepartment.   The  City  Hawkers'   and   Markets'\r\n\r\nDepartment are to be re-grouped under arrangements\r\n\r\nby the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the principle of integration was announced in the policy speech by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara at the beginning of this\r\n\r\nGovernment's term of office. At that  time,  there\r\n\r\nwas  no  appreciable  opposition  to  integration,\r\n\r\nreallocation  of  offices,  and  removal,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Joo Chiat has said, from one place  to\r\n\r\nanother.    Since   there   was   no   appreciable\r\n\r\nopposition,  it is assumed that the  principle  of\r\n\r\nintegration  has  been  accepted  as  the  logical\r\n\r\nprocess by which we can achieve an efficient and a\r\n\r\nstreamlined administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for actual cost, this is in fact negligible,\r\n\r\nbut  includes  such  items as  labour,  transport,\r\n\r\nadjustment   of   office   needs   and   providing\r\n\r\nfacilities for the public and so on. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSaving  from the public from now onwards, both  in\r\n\r\ntime  and  in transportation, will be immeasurably\r\n\r\ngrater.  For  instance, it is more convenient  for\r\n\r\nthe   public,  if  they  have  to  go  to  several\r\n\r\ndepartments in one Ministry, that they have  only\r\n\r\nto  go  to  one  building where  business  can  be\r\n\r\ncleared  possibly with one visit.  Similarly,  the\r\n\r\nadvantages  of  regrouping,  as  for  example,  by\r\n\r\nhaving  land-user departments together, will  also\r\n\r\ncut  down administrative procedure and costs, and\r\n\r\nshow   a   considerable   financial   saving.   An\r\n\r\nexpenditure of some tens of thousands  of  dollars\r\n\r\nweighed  against  public time and convenience  and\r\n\r\nthe administrative efficiency can, therefore, only\r\n\r\nbe regarded as an essential investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $50,000 for Head D48 ordered to stand part of the Fourth\r\n\r\nSupplementary Estimates of Expenditure for 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Heads of expenditure undisposed\r\n\r\nof.

M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, as to the first part of the question\r\n\r\nthe  answer  is  that 11 community centres  have  been\r\n\r\nbuilt  since the 1st of July, 1959, and that the total\r\n\r\nconstruction cost for these 11 community  centres  was\r\n\r\n$306,403.13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the second part of the question as to whether the\r\n\r\nconstruction of all these community centres was  given\r\n\r\nto  one  private  contractor without going  to  public\r\n\r\ntender, and why, the answer is \"yes\". In August  1959,\r\n\r\nthe P.W.D. was very short of architects and engineers.\r\n\r\nThe ex-Minister for National Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknows  the  circumstances under  which  this  shortage\r\n\r\narose.  The  Director  of Public  Works  advised  that\r\n\r\nprivate contractors should be engaged for this work. A\r\n\r\nreliable contractor and a private architect were  then\r\n\r\nengaged  to do this work. The Shaw Foundation and  the\r\n\r\nLee  Foundation, which provided most of the funds  for\r\n\r\nthe  building  of  these community  centres,  did  not\r\n\r\nrequire  the  work  to  be put out  to  public  tender\r\n\r\nbecause of their appreciation of the Ministry's desire\r\n\r\nnot  to  have any delays in the implementation of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding programme. The People's Association has since\r\n\r\ntaken  over the control of community centres from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  and  a  Tenders Committee of  the  Board  of\r\n\r\nManagement  will  take  over  the  work  of   building\r\n\r\ncommunity centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third part of the question:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`how does the Government fix the value of the\r\n\r\nconstruction;'.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the  value  of  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  was assessed on a certificate  from  the\r\n\r\narchitect that the price charged for each item of work\r\n\r\nto  be  done was fair and reasonable, and scrutiny  of\r\n\r\nthe charges was made by officials of the Ministry. The\r\n\r\nprice  of  the small community centres we  have  built\r\n\r\ncompares  favourably( with that of the small community\r\n\r\ncentres  constructed by the former  Rural  Board.  The\r\n\r\nmedium-size community centres we have built at a price\r\n\r\nof  about  $40,000 each have the floor  space  of  the\r\n\r\nlarge  community  centres constructed  by  the  former\r\n\r\ngovernment at a cost of about $130,000 each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some details, Mr Speaker, Sir, which would\r\n\r\ninterest, the House. The medium-size centres  that  we\r\n\r\nbuilt at Havelock Road and at Banda Street - the cost of\r\n\r\nthe   centre  at  Havelock  Road  was  $42,000,  which\r\n\r\nincluded   piling.  The  cost  of  the  Banda   Street\r\n\r\nCommunity  Centre  was $36,900, and this  included  an\r\n\r\nArcron  structure provided by the Department of Social\r\n\r\nWelfare.  The  area  of  the Havelock  Road  Community\r\n\r\nCentre  is  2,590  square feet, with five  classrooms.\r\n\r\nThere is a hail, downstairs and in this hail there  is\r\n\r\na movable screen in between. If this movable screen is\r\n\r\nremoved, the floor space is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreased  to  about 1,036 square feet,  so  that  the\r\n\r\ntotal  of  the  floor space available at the  Havelock\r\n\r\nRoad  Community Centre is 3,626 square feet. The  area\r\n\r\nof  the  Banda Street Community Centre is 2,944 square\r\n\r\nfeet,  with  five classrooms. There  is  also  a  hail\r\n\r\ndownstairs with a movable screen in between.  If  that\r\n\r\nmovable  screen  is removed, then  the  area  will  be\r\n\r\nincreased by 1,254 square feet, making the total  area\r\n\r\n4,198  square feet. These are what we term medium-size\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres. We will compare these  medium-size\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  with the old community  centre  at\r\n\r\nSims  Avenue.  The  total  area  of  the  Sims  Avenue\r\n\r\nCommunity Centre is 2,596 square feet. There are three\r\n\r\nclassrooms  and one hail. That centre was put  out  to\r\n\r\ntender and the price was $135,000. Now we come to  the\r\n\r\nChangi Community Centre. There are two classrooms  and\r\n\r\none  hall.  The total area is 2,456 square feet.  This\r\n\r\ncentre  was put out to tender, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  and\r\n\r\nthe  cost  was $130,000; so that we have built  larger\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres which we term medium-size community\r\n\r\ncentres  for  about one-third of the  price  that  the\r\n\r\nprevious government paid for those community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of the smaller community centres - the\r\n\r\nMinto  Road  Community Centre cost  us  $8,900.  That\r\n\r\nincluded   an   Arcron  structure  supplied   by   the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  Social  Welfare  from  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution  Exposition.  The  Beach  Road  Community\r\n\r\nCentre  cost us $11,448. That also included an  Arcron\r\n\r\nstructure.  The  Kampong Glam  Community  Centre  cost\r\n\r\n$14,581.  That included an Arcron structure.  The  Yio\r\n\r\nChu  Kang Community Centre cost $14,379. This included\r\n\r\nan  Arcron structure. The Maude Road Community  Centre\r\n\r\nwhich  was recently opened cost $15,613. There was  no\r\n\r\nArcron structure supplied. All the materials for  that\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre were supplied by the contractor.  If\r\n\r\nwe  compare these prices, Mr Speaker, Sir,  with  the\r\n\r\nprices  for the small community centres built  by  the\r\n\r\nRural  Board, we find that the Changi Point  Community\r\n\r\nCentre cost. $16,000 without sanitation. The Ama  Keng\r\n\r\nCommunity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCentre cost $12,500 without sanitation. The West Coast\r\n\r\nRoad Community Centre cost $11,000 without sanitation.\r\n\r\nThe  Jalan Eunos Community Centre, which is  the  most\r\n\r\nmodern of the old community centres, cost $25,000 with\r\n\r\nmodern  sanitation as against our prices. If  you  go\r\n\r\nround and have a look at these community centres,  you\r\n\r\nwill  find  that  in the new small community  centres,\r\n\r\nthey   are   all  provided  with  basketball  pitches.\r\n\r\nbadminton  courts  and so on, which cost  more  money,\r\n\r\nwhile  the other community centres have not got  those\r\n\r\namenities,  Sir.  That is the comparison  between  the\r\n\r\nprices  of  work  that has been  done  by  a  reliable\r\n\r\ncontractor with the help of an architect and officials\r\n\r\nof  the Ministry, and work that was previously put out\r\n\r\nto tender by the previous government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to the fourth part of the question:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`whether the previous architect for the building of\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  was  paid architect  fees  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment or was given a cut by the contractor;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Shaw Foundation and the Lee\r\n\r\nFoundation  received separate bills from the  previous\r\n\r\narchitect and the contractor for their work in respect\r\n\r\nof  each community centre, and separate payments  were\r\n\r\nmade.  Where  payments  were  made  from  funds   made\r\n\r\navailable to the People's Association by the Treasury,\r\n\r\nthe  same procedure was followed. Out of this $306,000\r\n\r\nabout  $250,000  of  that money  came  from  the  Shaw\r\n\r\nFoundation  and the Lee Foundation. The other  $50,000\r\n\r\ncame from the Treasury - the money that was voted by the\r\n\r\nAssembly  for the People's Association. In every  case\r\n\r\nwhere  payments  were made - whether the  payments  were\r\n\r\nmade by the Shaw Foundation or the Lee Foundation,  or\r\n\r\nwhether  the  payments  were made  by  the  Treasurer!\r\n\r\nSecretary  and  the Deputy Chairman  of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation - there  were separate  bills  presented  in\r\n\r\nevery   case  by  the  contractor  and  the   previous\r\n\r\narchitect, and separate payments were in fact made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the fifth part of the question, which is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`whether the Government wilt request the Board of\r\n\r\nArchitects to make, or will initiate proceedings  for,\r\n\r\na public inquiry into this matter.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must inform the House that the Treasury tender\r\n\r\nprocedures are not applicable in the case of buildings\r\n\r\nput up by private organisations for the Government, or\r\n\r\nin  `the  case  of  buildings put up from  funds  made\r\n\r\navailable  to independent statutory bodies.  Al-though\r\n\r\nnot  put  out for public tender, the cost of the  work\r\n\r\nhas   been   carefully  scrutinized  by   professional\r\n\r\narchitects  and  Government officials  experienced  in\r\n\r\nplanning and designing community centres. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthe allegation that the previous architect received  a\r\n\r\ncut  from  the  contractor is  groundless.  For  these\r\n\r\nreasons,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  a  public,  inquiry  by\r\n\r\nGovernment or by the Board of Architects is not in the\r\n\r\nleast called for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, would the Government\r\n\r\nconsider abolishing the public tender system since  it\r\n\r\nis so cheap to build without going to public tender?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It seems to be a different question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think it is\r\n\r\nfair for me to answer that question, because if it  is\r\n\r\nraised  seriously I think it is a matter which  really\r\n\r\nconcerns the Ministry of Finance.

We wanted to show to the public  the  work\r\n\r\nof  the  various  Ministries of  the  Government.  The\r\n\r\nFinance Minister was very strict about expenditure. He\r\n\r\nlimited  us  to $2,000 each per stand. He  is  a  very\r\n\r\nastute person in these matters. Mr Speaker, Sir.  One\r\n\r\nday  he asked me to call at the Victoria Memorial Hall\r\n\r\nto  see how the work of the stands was progressing.  I\r\n\r\npaid a visit there, Mr Speaker, Sir, and I found that\r\n\r\nwhereas  all  the other Ministries were using  screens\r\n\r\nfor  stands, there was a beautiful structure going  up\r\n\r\nat  the  Victoria  Memorial Hall for the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development. I looked around  and  I  found\r\n\r\nthat  a  contractor was engaged in this work.  I  duly\r\n\r\nreported the fact to the Minister for Finance and so I\r\n\r\nhad  to go and get another contractor to do our  work.\r\n\r\nThe  contractor  that  I employed  knew  the  previous\r\n\r\narchitect.

This previous architect  was  a\r\n\r\ncolleague   of  my  ex-colleague,  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nNational  Development, in Australia, and  he  disliked\r\n\r\nthis man intensely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Or are  there  any\r\n\r\nother reasons?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to the\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampong Kembangan, there are a  number  of\r\n\r\nreasons  for the regrettable decline in the number  of\r\n\r\nstudents attending the national language classes.  The\r\n\r\nmain  reason  is,  of course, the  lack  of  sustained\r\n\r\ninterest  of the students. Like every other enterprise\r\n\r\nof  a voluntary nature, there are many who join in the\r\n\r\nfirst  flush of enthusiasm, but who abandon the course\r\n\r\nwhen  they  find that the going is not  so  easy.  The\r\n\r\npresent  numbers probably represent the hard  core  of\r\n\r\npersons genuinely interested in gaining proficiency in\r\n\r\nthe  national language. There is scope for  a  further\r\n\r\nincrease in enrolment for the national language  night\r\n\r\nclasses,  but  the  efforts  of  the  Lembaga  Gerakan\r\n\r\nPelajaran   Dewasa  in  this  field  are   necessarily\r\n\r\ncircumscribed  by  the availability  of  suitable  and\r\n\r\nqualified instructors in the national\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlanguage,  of  which  fact I am sure  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan is aware. But the  Lembaga  Gerakan\r\n\r\nPelajaran Dewasa is sparing no effort in its endeavour\r\n\r\nto spread knowledge of the national language, and once\r\n\r\nits  teething troubles are over, a rise in the  number\r\n\r\nof  students  may  be expected. The  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan is probably aware that the  Lembaga\r\n\r\nGerakan   Pelajaran  Dewasa  is  presently  conducting\r\n\r\nspecial courses for teachers to teach the students. It\r\n\r\ntakes some time to produce a good teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CURRENCY BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>First Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill intituled  \"An\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to  implement  an  Agreement  between   the\r\n\r\nGovernments of the Federation of Malaya, the States of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Brunei and the Colonies of Sarawak  and\r\n\r\nNorth  Borneo  relating to currency  and  for  matters\r\n\r\nincidental thereto.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Immediately after the conclusion\r\n\r\nof the proceedings on item 2 on the Order Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I lay upon the\r\n\r\nTable a Certificate of Urgency signed by the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara in respect of the Currency Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order.

Each Government then undertook\r\n\r\nto enact the appropriate legislation to ratify the new\r\n\r\nCurrency  Agreement as early as possible so  that  the\r\n\r\nnew   Agreement  could  be  brought  into  force.  The\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya, Sarawak and North  Borneo  have\r\n\r\nalready enacted appropriate legislation, and a similar\r\n\r\npurpose is intended for Singapore by the Currency Bill\r\n\r\nnow laid before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need explain the provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill  itself, which are simple or will be  clear  from\r\n\r\nthe  Explanatory  Statement.  But  in  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nCurrency  Agreement set out in the Schedule, I  should\r\n\r\npoint out some of the major provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as is befitting the sovereign nation of the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya, the self-governing  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  State of Brunei,  Sarawak  and  North\r\n\r\nBorneo,  the new Agreement provides that the  Currency\r\n\r\nBoard   should  be  responsible  to  only   the   five\r\n\r\nParticipating Governments. Under the old 1950 Currency\r\n\r\nAgreement,  a Participating Government could  abrogate\r\n\r\nthe  Agreement  only with the approval of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  Secretary of State for the Colonies.  Another\r\n\r\nclause provided that the Secretary of State should  be\r\n\r\nthe    arbitrator   in   any   dispute   between   the\r\n\r\nParticipating Governments, and his approval had to  be\r\n\r\nobtained  even  for relatively less important  matters\r\n\r\nsuch  as the design of new notes and coins. Under  the\r\n\r\nnew Agreement, no reference whatsoever is necessary to\r\n\r\nthe  authority  of  the Secretary  of  State,  as  all\r\n\r\nreferences  to  him  have  been  deleted  in  the  new\r\n\r\nAgreement.  The essence of the Agreement is  that  the\r\n\r\nBoard  of Commissioners of Currency is now responsible\r\n\r\nto  the Participating Governments, whose decisions  on\r\n\r\nalmost all important points must be unanimous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, for reasons which the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nis  in  agreement, the Federation of  Malaya  is  now\r\n\r\ngiven  increased representation on the Currency Board.\r\n\r\nOf  the  seven  members on the  Board,  two  will  the\r\n\r\nappointed by the Federation of Malaya Government,  and\r\n\r\none  each  by  the  Governments of Singapore,  Brunei,\r\n\r\nSarawak   and   North   Borneo,  together   with   one\r\n\r\nindependent member whose appointment must be with  the\r\n\r\nunanimous  consent  of the Participating  Governments.\r\n\r\nThe Singapore and Federation representatives will have\r\n\r\nthree  votes each, while the other members  will  only\r\n\r\nhave  one  vote each. It can, therefore, be seen  that\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  Government will  have  a  predominant\r\n\r\nvoting strength of six votes, and it also provides the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Board in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  person  of  probably the Honourable  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  as well. The Singapore representative  would\r\n\r\nbe the Deputy Chairman of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, which is probably the most important in our\r\n\r\nviewpoint, is that the new Agreement provides for  the\r\n\r\ninvestment of a portion of the assets of the  Currency\r\n\r\nFund   in   the   territories  of  the   Participating\r\n\r\nGovernments. The 1950 Currency Agreement provides only\r\n\r\nrestricted  avenues  of investment,  and  we  saw  the\r\n\r\nstrange phenomenon of the assets of territories  which\r\n\r\nneeded  development  finance urgently  being  invested\r\n\r\noverseas  and  used for financing the  development  of\r\n\r\nother  countries,  some of which are financially  more\r\n\r\naffluent  than  ourselves. Although it  is  recognised\r\n\r\nthat  reserves  of the Board should at  all  times  be\r\n\r\nadequate to maintain confidence in the Malayan dollar,\r\n\r\nit  was  felt  that  at the same time  assets  of  the\r\n\r\nCurrency  Fund should be mobilised to some  extent  in\r\n\r\ninitiating  the economic development of the  countries\r\n\r\nthe  Board serves. Hence clause 10 (4) of the new Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the investment of not  more  than  $300\r\n\r\nmillion  of  the  assets  of  the  Currency  Fund   in\r\n\r\nsecurities  guaranteed  by any  of  the  Participating\r\n\r\nGovernments, to be spread over a period of three years\r\n\r\nfrom the date when the Agreement comes into force. The\r\n\r\ndistribution   of  assets  for  local  investment   is\r\n\r\ngoverned by the Third Schedule to the Agreement, which\r\n\r\nprovides   that   the   reserves   available   to    a\r\n\r\nParticipating Government shall be determined  directly\r\n\r\nby  its  share in the profits of the Currency  Surplus\r\n\r\nFund  in  the preceding financial year. In  turn,  the\r\n\r\nshare of profits is governed by the Second Schedule to\r\n\r\nthe   Agreement,  where,  broadly,  the  formula   for\r\n\r\ndistribution  is  based  on  the  amount  of  currency\r\n\r\ncirculating  in  the  three territorial  divisions  of\r\n\r\nBorneo, Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. On the\r\n\r\nbasis  outlined above, Singapore's share of  the  $300\r\n\r\nmillion  of the assets of the Currency Fund  available\r\n\r\nfor  investment in the securities of the Participating\r\n\r\nGovernments   is  about  $60  million.  An   important\r\n\r\nprovision  in the Second Schedule to the Agreement  is\r\n\r\nthat   under  section  (iii)  the  method  of   profit\r\n\r\napportionment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  from time to time be varied by agreement  between\r\n\r\nthe  Governments  concerned, and  with  the  unanimous\r\n\r\napproval of all Participating Governments. The door is\r\n\r\ntherefore  open  for Singapore and the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya to undertake discussion to review the method of\r\n\r\nprofit sharing between the two territories. Any change\r\n\r\nin the profit sharing formula would in turn affect the\r\n\r\nassets available for investment in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, clauses in the new Currency Agreement\r\n\r\nprovide  for,  and  anticipate  the  future,  when   a\r\n\r\nParticipating Government may wish to withdraw from the\r\n\r\nCurrency Agreement, thus leading to the dissolution of\r\n\r\ncommon  currency  arrangements  provided  by  the  new\r\n\r\nAgreement. Clause 17 of the Agreement stipulates  that\r\n\r\nwhen  any  Participating Government wishes to withdraw\r\n\r\nfrom  the Agreement, a notice must be lodged with  the\r\n\r\nCurrency  Board 18 months prior to the date of  actual\r\n\r\nwithdrawal.  This period is regarded  as  the  minimum\r\n\r\ntime during which other Participating Governments  can\r\n\r\nmake alternative arrangements. The clauses that follow\r\n\r\nup to clause 20 are clauses providing for the winding-up  of  the  Board should any Government withdraw.  At\r\n\r\nthis  point,  I  should perhaps  say  that  while  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government has agreed to the new  Currency\r\n\r\nAgreement,  it  at  best  contains  provisions  for  a\r\n\r\ntransitional period from a common currency arrangement\r\n\r\nto  one where she will be able to control and regulate\r\n\r\nher own currency. It is thought unlikely that she will\r\n\r\ncontinue  a  common  Currency Agreement  indefinitely.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  new  Agreement is a  working  basis  to\r\n\r\ngradually transform the present currency structure  to\r\n\r\na more independent one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, the new Currency Agreement will at one and\r\n\r\nthe  same  time  ensure the stability of  the  Malayan\r\n\r\ndollar and enable a part of the Currency Fund's assets\r\n\r\nto be used for financing our own economic development.\r\n\r\nIt also provides for the future through the winding-up\r\n\r\nclauses, and yet is solidly linked to the present.  In\r\n\r\nconclusion, I need not Stress that it will secure the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaintenance of a sound, stable and respected  currency\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a  prerequisite for economic stability  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a convenient time to suspend?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I therefore suspend this Assembly.

I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should perhaps explain why Government\r\n\r\nconsiders  it necessary to take the Bill  through  all\r\n\r\nthe  three stages today. The House will be aware that,\r\n\r\nwith  effect  from today, the Government  has  imposed\r\n\r\nprotective  duties on the import of washing  soap.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  the Government has  liberalised  the\r\n\r\nimports  of  washing soap. Previously the  imports  of\r\n\r\nwashing soap were placed under special licensing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 29th October, 1959, the report of the\r\n\r\nCommittee to consider the imposition of duties on  the\r\n\r\nimports  of hard soap and detergents was presented  to\r\n\r\nthe Assembly. The Committee recommended the imposition\r\n\r\nof import duty on washing soap as a measure to protect\r\n\r\nthe  local industry. It was not possible, for  reasons\r\n\r\nwhich  I shall explain later, to introduce such duties\r\n\r\nforthwith.  Accordingly it was decided  to  place  the\r\n\r\nimport  of washing soap on special licence with  quota\r\n\r\nceilings  based  on  previous  performance.  Now  this\r\n\r\naction  could be justified under the General Agreement\r\n\r\non  Tariffs and Trade only as a temporary measure.  It\r\n\r\nwas necessary to regulate soap imports principally  to\r\n\r\nprevent  speculative hoarding of a commodity on  which\r\n\r\nan  import  duty  was expected to be imposed.  Certain\r\n\r\namendments  have  to  be made to existing  legislation\r\n\r\nbefore  proper  administration of the  duty  could  be\r\n\r\nenforced. At the same time, the Customs Ordinance was\r\n\r\ndue  for  a general overhaul, and it was thought  that\r\n\r\nthis new amendment should go into the general revision\r\n\r\nof  the  Ordinance. Thus what was intended as a short-term  temporary expedient turned out to have a longer\r\n\r\nlife than was originally anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the introduction of these duties, Government\r\n\r\nwas  faced  with  two alternative  courses  of  action\r\n\r\nregarding  the mechanics and timing of this Bill.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  alternative was to wait until the new Bill  was\r\n\r\nintroduced,  and  to impose a duty  under  the  powers\r\n\r\nderived there-from. It would still have been necessary\r\n\r\nto  take  the  Bill through all three stages  at  once\r\n\r\nbecause   of  the  complaints  that  the  Government's\r\n\r\nregulation of the import of washing soap was  contrary\r\n\r\nto the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to which\r\n\r\nwe   are   bound.  It  was  felt  that   under   these\r\n\r\ncircumstances  to  take  the Bill  through  all  three\r\n\r\nstages  without  at  the same time  giving  the  House\r\n\r\nsufficient  reason  therefore would  be  unreasonable.\r\n\r\nHowever,  because the interval between the passing  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill and its coming into force would take several\r\n\r\ndays, to give reasons justifying such action may  lead\r\n\r\nto  the  hoarding and rapid increase in the  price  of\r\n\r\nimported\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwashing   soap.  The  second  alternative  which   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has chosen is to impose a duty under powers\r\n\r\nderived from the existing Ordinance and then introduce\r\n\r\na  new  Bill in order that the implementation of these\r\n\r\nduties may be made easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now why is this so? Under the existing Ordinance, the\r\n\r\nComptroller has no power as such to decide  whether  a\r\n\r\ncommodity is dutiable or not until an order  has  been\r\n\r\nmade  under section 11 of the Ordinance, although such\r\n\r\npowers  are  implied, for example, in section  42  and\r\n\r\nsection  73  (1) . By contrast, clause 23 of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nspecifically  provides that the  Comptroller  has  the\r\n\r\npower  to decide. This is of particular importance  in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  soap, because, at present there  is  an\r\n\r\nimport  duty  only on washing soap and not  on  toilet\r\n\r\nsoap or synthetic detergents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the existing Ordinance does not provide for\r\n\r\nduty  drawback except on tobacco. Thus, if an importer\r\n\r\nimports   washing   soap,  pays   duty   thereon   and\r\n\r\nsubsequently  re-exports such soap, the law  does  not\r\n\r\nprovide  for  duty drawback. Clause  69  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the possibility of duty drawback  under\r\n\r\nconditions in which the goods are identifiable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 of the Bill also amplifies the definition\r\n\r\nof  \"value\" for Customs purposes. At present the  duty\r\n\r\non  soap is a specific duty, and, therefore, the  need\r\n\r\nfor  this amplification does not arise. But in  future\r\n\r\nit  is conceivable that some duties would be fixed  on\r\n\r\nan  ad-valorem basis. For this reason, it is necessary\r\n\r\nto  have  a clearer definition of \"value\" for  Customs\r\n\r\npurposes.  The  present rather limited  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"value\" is contained in section 3 of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for additional powers,\r\n\r\nincluding -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the power for the Minister to appoint\r\n\r\nall members of the Liquors Licensing Board which is to\r\n\r\nreplace  the  present Board of Licensing  Justices  of\r\n\r\nwhich  three  members are at present  elected  by  the\r\n\r\nJustices of the Peace from among their number;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  power  for the Comptroller to determine  whether\r\n\r\nany  goods  come  under  the  dutiable  or  prohibited\r\n\r\ncategories presented to the Minister's order, so  that\r\n\r\npossible  delays  due  to the  necessity  of  frequent\r\n\r\nreferences to the Minister may be avoided;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the power for senior Customs officers to issue search\r\n\r\nwarrants  and  to conduct searches. This will  replace\r\n\r\nthe present practice of appointing Customs officers to\r\n\r\nbe Justices of the Peace as and when they require such\r\n\r\npower. This practice is administratively undesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there is the power for proper officers of\r\n\r\ncustoms to determine the proportion of goods which are\r\n\r\nto  be  opened and examined and tested, and to  remove\r\n\r\nthe confusion regarding the interpretation of a 10 per\r\n\r\ncentum tax as is required at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other major amendments include the transfer of the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for the collection of a special tax  on\r\n\r\nheavy  oil  engined vehicles from the  Comptroller  of\r\n\r\nCustoms to the Registrar of Vehicles to facilitate the\r\n\r\npayment of tax by the owners of such vehicles, and the\r\n\r\nreduction  of  the amounts of drawback  duty  paid  on\r\n\r\ntobacco allowed to the manufacturer from the whole  of\r\n\r\nthe  duty  paid to seven-eights of the  duty  paid  to\r\n\r\nallow for the recovery of administrative cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a consolidating\r\n\r\nBill  of  the Customs Ordinance (Chapter 160) and  all\r\n\r\nother subsequent Ordinances which have amended Chapter\r\n\r\n160  of  our laws. While consolidating the Ordinances,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has availed itself of the  opportunity\r\n\r\nto  introduce new clauses which, in its view, help  to\r\n\r\nclarify  the  Customs Ordinance  or  to  give  to  the\r\n\r\nComptroller  of Customs certain definite added  powers\r\n\r\nwhich  would  enable  him  to administer  the  Customs\r\n\r\nOrdinance more effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on a number of occasions I have\r\n\r\nspoken   in   this  Assembly  against  the  increasing\r\n\r\npractice  of  the  Government to  introduce  Bills  on\r\n\r\nCertificates   of  Urgency.  In  this  instance,   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  is  obliged to the Government  for  having\r\n\r\nsent this Bill two days earlier. On other occasions we\r\n\r\nwere faced with Bills being laid on the Table when  we\r\n\r\ngot  here. I am glad that the Minister for Finance  in\r\n\r\nhis  Second Reading speech, has explained why  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  necessary  to take this Bill through  all  three\r\n\r\nstages today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my own view is that no\r\n\r\nconsolidating Bill, with certain amendments  put  into\r\n\r\nit because the Government wants to avail itself of the\r\n\r\nopportunity to tidy up the Bill, should be put through\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly,  or any other  Assembly  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter, in one day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says that if this Bill had not been taken through all its three readings today, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  might have been faced with the possibility\r\n\r\nof  hoarding  in  soaps  which  have  now  come  under\r\n\r\ntaxation  and, therefore, that would lead to  loss  of\r\n\r\nrevenue. With great respect to the Minister, I beg  to\r\n\r\ndiffer. I think the Comptroller has sufficient  powers\r\n\r\nunder  the existing Ordinance to declare soap  of  the\r\n\r\nkind  which  has  been  declared  dutiable  today   as\r\n\r\ndutiable, and to see that duty thereon is collected as\r\n\r\nfrom  today.  The  proposed Bill  will  not  give  the\r\n\r\nGovernment any further powers in that matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take it that it is under section 11 (2) of the\r\n\r\nexisting Ordinance that this new declaration that duty\r\n\r\nis  payable on soap has been gazetted. The  clause  in\r\n\r\nthe new Bill is identically the same. It has given the\r\n\r\nGovernment no greater powers. The question of hoarding\r\n\r\nonly  arises  when people know that the Government  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  bring in a particular category of goods  on\r\n\r\nthe taxation list. Then they rush to hoard those goods\r\n\r\nbefore the Government puts them on its taxation  list.\r\n\r\nIn this case, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has the\r\n\r\npower  to  put  any article which it so  wishes  under\r\n\r\nsection 11 (2) of the existing Ordinance. Therefore, I\r\n\r\nsubmit, with great respect to the Minister, that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  was  completely  unnecessary  to  move  this  Bill\r\n\r\nthrough  all its three stages today merely  to  defeat\r\n\r\nthe hoarders. Sir, I agree that substantially the Bill\r\n\r\nis exactly the same as the Customs Ordinance as it now\r\n\r\nis. But there are a number of new additions on which I\r\n\r\nfeel  I  am  not competent to speak because  they  are\r\n\r\nmatters  which  affect the trading community  and  the\r\n\r\nsystem  of carrying on a business or a trade. I  would\r\n\r\nhave  felt  happier if this Assembly could  have  been\r\n\r\nable  to  pass  it  after all responsible  views  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  trading and mercantile  matters  had  been\r\n\r\nconsulted  and  given  effect to.  I  understand,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  that  there is a Trade Advisory  Council.  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether the new amendments have been put to the\r\n\r\nTrade Advisory Council and what their views are on the\r\n\r\namendments  put  to them. I believe  such  a  Council\r\n\r\nexists. If I remember rightly, the Government has said\r\n\r\nthat  in  all  matters affecting  trade  and  business\r\n\r\ninterests, this Council would be consulted before  any\r\n\r\nlegislation is put through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point on which I wish to touch in\r\n\r\nthis speech, Mr Speaker, Sir, but I will elaborate on\r\n\r\nthat  point in the Committee stage. In respect of this\r\n\r\npoint  I  have filed an amendment, a copy of  which  I\r\n\r\nhave  already given to the Minister for Finance. As  I\r\n\r\nsee  it, Mr Speaker, there are at the moment only two\r\n\r\nclasses  of  goods which are liable to taxation  under\r\n\r\nthe existing Ordinance. Section 11 (1) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There shall be charged, levied and paid such duties\r\n\r\non intoxicating liquor, tobacco and petroleum imported\r\n\r\ninto   or  manufactured  in  the  Colony  as  may   be\r\n\r\nprescribed  from  time to time by the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara by order published in the Gazette.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  that we get under subsection (1), Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\ngoods,  \"intoxicating  liquor, tobacco  and  petroleum\r\n\r\nimported  into  or manufactured in the Colony\".  These\r\n\r\nthree   types  of  goods  are  taxable.   Then   under\r\n\r\nsubsection   (2)  is  another  class  of  goods.   The\r\n\r\nsubsection reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where, on consideration of the report of a committee\r\n\r\nof  not  less  than  three persons appointed  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  by  the  Minister,  by  notification  in  the\r\n\r\nGazette,  in  respect of any goods specified  in  that\r\n\r\nnotification, it appears to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nthat,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhaving  regard to the need for protecting any industry\r\n\r\nwhich is established or is about to be established for\r\n\r\nthe manufacture of any goods in the Colony...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then  to  protect those interests the  Government  can\r\n\r\nlist  certain goods in a Gazette notification.  It  is\r\n\r\nunder that subsection (2) that the Government has this\r\n\r\nmorning listed soap as dutiable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will try to convince the Minister\r\n\r\nthat,  although  he says that this is a  consolidating\r\n\r\nBill,  it  does not take the powers of the  Government\r\n\r\nany  further than it has today. I will try to convince\r\n\r\nhim  that  under  the  proposed  clause  11  (1) ,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  brought  in  yet  another   category,\r\n\r\nperhaps  unintentionally. But I will not elaborate  on\r\n\r\nthat at the moment, Mr Speaker. I will do so when  we\r\n\r\nare in Committee. Other than that, Mr Speaker, I have\r\n\r\nnothing  to say about this Bill. This is substantially\r\n\r\na consolidating Bill, as the Minister has said, except\r\n\r\nperhaps for this over-sight and for certain matters to\r\n\r\nwhich,  if he has consulted trading interests  and  if\r\n\r\nthey   have  agreed, we  will  certainly   have   no\r\n\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it\r\n\r\nseems  to  me  that this very important Bill  marks  a\r\n\r\nmajor  change in the economic policy of the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I may be wrong, Sir, but it  looks  as  if\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  will mean that the Government is beginning\r\n\r\nto  shift,  shall we hope gradually, from a policy  of\r\n\r\nfree trade to that of protective tariffs. Sir, we  are\r\n\r\nat  one  with  the Government in wanting to  encourage\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in Singapore. But if in the  process\r\n\r\nof encouraging industrialisation it is in such a hurry\r\n\r\nthat  it spoils the entrepot trade before we are ready\r\n\r\nto have enough industries, then the results may not be\r\n\r\nas  advantageous as we have expected and may  even  be\r\n\r\ninjurious.  We know, Sir, that even among the  traders\r\n\r\nthe  question of protection and free trade has aroused\r\n\r\na great deal of controversy. From the consumers' point\r\n\r\nof  view, of course, nobody wants to pay more  for  an\r\n\r\nimported  product on which increased duties have  been\r\n\r\nimposed,  or for a local product which may be inferior\r\n\r\nin  quality.  I  would suggest,  Sir,  that  with  the\r\n\r\nimplementation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  this new policy great care should be taken that we\r\n\r\ndo  not  cause more unemployment, because  if  due  to\r\n\r\nimposition  of new duties we put out of  employment  a\r\n\r\ncertain  number  of people and industries  created  or\r\n\r\nprotected  are  not  able to give employment  to  more\r\n\r\npeople,  then in the long run we shall have  a  bigger\r\n\r\nunemployment problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of .the controversial nature of this new\r\n\r\npolicy of increased protection, we on this side of the\r\n\r\nHouse  think  that an important Bill like this  should\r\n\r\nnot be rushed through on a Certificate of Urgency.  In\r\n\r\nthe  past,  whenever very important Bills  had  to  be\r\n\r\npassed,  the public were given a chance to  study  the\r\n\r\nclauses  of  the  Bills so that if  they  thought  the\r\n\r\nclauses should be amended, they would have the  chance\r\n\r\nat least to put forward their views to the Government.\r\n\r\nBut as it is, of course, we have just got to accept  a\r\n\r\nfait  accompli. We hope, Sir, that this  procedure  of\r\n\r\ngetting Bills through on Certificates of Urgency  will\r\n\r\nnot become the normal procedure in this House, because\r\n\r\nthereby  we  defeat  the very  purpose  of  having  an\r\n\r\nAssembly. Sir, although the Government will be able to\r\n\r\npush   through  this  Bill,  we  hope  that   in   the\r\n\r\nimplementation thereof great care should be  taken  so\r\n\r\nthat where increased duties are suggested which may be\r\n\r\nof  a controversial nature, they should go slow on it.\r\n\r\nIt  is no use giving up a bird in the hand in the hope\r\n\r\nof  getting  two  birds  in  the  bush,  if  we  cause\r\n\r\nunemployment  among those who depend on  the  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade in the hope of giving employment to those to  be\r\n\r\nemployed in factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall first\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the  comments of the  Member  for  Tanglin\r\n\r\nbecause  I  think  he is labouring  under  a  complete\r\n\r\nmisconception of what this Bill is about, it will  not\r\n\r\ntake me long to correct this misconception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member is under the impression that this\r\n\r\nBill  introduces a major change in the economic policy\r\n\r\nof  the Government of Singapore. Further, he seems  to\r\n\r\nlabour  under the impression that the act  itself  of\r\n\r\npassing the Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould introduce new taxes. I do not think he has  been\r\n\r\nvery  diligent in his homework, because it would  have\r\n\r\nbeen very obvious from the explanatory notes that this\r\n\r\nBill does not in itself introduce any new duties.  For\r\n\r\nthe  most  part, it consolidates the existing  Customs\r\n\r\nOrdinance, but it allows a certain modification of the\r\n\r\nadministrative procedures so that new  duties  as  and\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are  imposed by the  Government  could  be\r\n\r\neffectively administered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the new duties that would be imposed under\r\n\r\nclause  11 (2) of the Bill, the one immediately before\r\n\r\nthe State, of course, is that on soap. I have referred\r\n\r\nto  the  Report  of the Tariff Advisory  Committee  on\r\n\r\nSoap.  And it is this procedure that will be  followed\r\n\r\nby  the  Government  before any  new  import  duty  is\r\n\r\nimposed.  That is to say, a Committee will be  set  up\r\n\r\nunder  clause 11; the public will have an  opportunity\r\n\r\nto  make  representations to the Committee  either  in\r\n\r\nfavour of or against any new import duty. That was the\r\n\r\nprocedure  we  adopted  before  we  decided  upon  the\r\n\r\nimposition of duties on washing soap. So much for  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member's misgivings. Indeed they are all based on\r\n\r\na  complete  misunderstanding of the purpose  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to reply to the Member for Farrer Park. He was\r\n\r\nin some doubt as to whether it was really necessary to\r\n\r\npass  the  Bill  through all stages  today.  He  quite\r\n\r\nrightly  pointed out that there could be  very  little\r\n\r\nfear from the point of view of loss of revenue. We are\r\n\r\nnot  so much worried about the loss of revenue because\r\n\r\nthe  import of washing soap is already regulated,  and\r\n\r\nit  is  not possible for any importer today to  import\r\n\r\ngreater  quantities  than  his  quota.  What  we   are\r\n\r\nconcerned  with are the repercussions that  this  Bill\r\n\r\ncould have on the market for soap. There would be some\r\n\r\nuncertainty as to the amount of duty and the timing of\r\n\r\nthe  imposition of the duty. By and large, this  would\r\n\r\nhave  a  disturbing and upsetting effect on the market\r\n\r\nfor soap. Therefore, in order to avoid any possibility\r\n\r\nof  this,  we  decided  to act quickly  and  carry  it\r\n\r\nthrough - the  two operations of imposing the  duty  and\r\n\r\npassing this Bill today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has stated that, in his\r\n\r\nopinion, the existing Ordinance is quite adequate.  It\r\n\r\nis  adequate for the imposition of duties  on  washing\r\n\r\nsoap,  but  it  is  not  adequate  for  the  effective\r\n\r\nadministration,  because when you come  to  particular\r\n\r\ncommodities,  there  may be  doubt  as  to  whether  a\r\n\r\nparticular  brand of soap is to be considered  washing\r\n\r\nsoap,  or  toilet soap, or any other form of soap.  In\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, clause 32 (2) gives the Comptroller  power\r\n\r\nto  make  a  decision  on  the  subject  so  that  the\r\n\r\nadministration  of  revenue  collection  will  not  be\r\n\r\nbogged down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the need to refer to mercantile interests,\r\n\r\nI  have already explained, in my remarks on the  views\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for Tanglin, that commercial interests\r\n\r\nhave adequate opportunity to make their views known to\r\n\r\nthe  Tariff Advisory Committee on Soap. As regards the\r\n\r\ngeneral  provisions of this Bill, they concern largely\r\n\r\nthe  administration  of this Bill.  There  is  nothing\r\n\r\ncontroversial  at  all about these provisions  because\r\n\r\nthey are, by and large, adopted from the corresponding\r\n\r\nOrdinance which has already been in operation  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 10 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I have drafted an amendment and have\r\n\r\nhanded it to the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly.

The purpose of\r\n\r\nthis amendment is merely to bring the proposed clause\r\n\r\ninto line with what I consider are the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe existing law. The provisions of the existing law, Mr Speaker, Sir, are in section 11 of the Ordinance -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) There shall be charged, levied and paid such\r\n\r\nduties  on  intoxicating liquor, tobacco and petroleum\r\n\r\nimported into or manufactured in the Colony as may  be\r\n\r\nprescribed  from  time to time by the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara by order published in the Gazette.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the first category of goods\r\n\r\nin respect of which duty may be charged. And it is the\r\n\r\nlaw  itself  which  says  that, intoxicating  liquor,\r\n\r\ntobacco  and petroleum shall be chargeable with  duty.\r\n\r\nAnd  the quantum of duty is also provided for in  that\r\n\r\nsection.   Subsection  (2)  of  section  11   of   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, Mr Speaker, Sir, provides that -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where a committee of not less than three persons\r\n\r\nappointed for the purpose by the Minister...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>have  made  certain recommendations  which  have  been\r\n\r\nforwarded  to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  and  if  on\r\n\r\nperusal of that document it appears to him that -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`having regard to the need for protecting any\r\n\r\nindustry  which  is  established or  is  about  to  be\r\n\r\nestablished  for the manufacture of any goods  in  the\r\n\r\nColony  and to the interests of the entrepot trade  of\r\n\r\nthe  Colony in respect of such goods, it is  expedient\r\n\r\nto  impose duties on the import of such goods, he  may\r\n\r\nby order published in the Gazette prescribe the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduties  to  be levied and paid on such goods  imported\r\n\r\ninto  the  Colony and such duties shall  thereupon  be\r\n\r\ncharged, levied and paid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that no duties shall be charged or levied\r\n\r\nunder  this  subsection on any textiles imported  into\r\n\r\nthe Colony.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  that  in addition, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the  first\r\n\r\ncategory  set  out in subsection (1),  subsection  (2)\r\n\r\nsets out that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara may go beyond\r\n\r\nintoxicating liquor, tobacco and petroleum. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  goods  in  respect of which the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  may  go  over  and above subsection  (1),  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, are goods in respect of which a  report\r\n\r\nhas  been  submitted to him by a committee  of  three.\r\n\r\nNow,  if  the Minister accepts that position,  and  if\r\n\r\nthat  is  the correct expose of the present  position,\r\n\r\nlet  us now therefore look at the present proposed new\r\n\r\nclause.  The  proposed new clause, as I read  it,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, seems to set out three categories:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) There shall be charged, levied and paid to the\r\n\r\nComptroller   such  customs  duties  on   intoxicating\r\n\r\nliquor, tobacco, petroleum,'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>that is the first category, Mr Speaker. Sir, as set\r\n\r\nout in subsection (1) of the existing law. Then -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`any goods made dutiable on import or manufacture'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This, in my view, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the second\r\n\r\ncategory which is not provided for in the  xisting\r\n\r\nlaw. And then, the third category -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`and any goods made dutiable by an order under\r\n\r\nsubsection (2) of this section which are imported into\r\n\r\nor manufactured in Singapore, as may be prescribed by\r\n\r\nthe Yang di-Pertuan Negara by order published in the\r\n\r\nGazette.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  third category here, Mr Speaker, is the  second\r\n\r\ncategory  provided  for under subsection  (2)  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  Ordinance.  So that if  this  clause  as  it\r\n\r\nstands becomes law, we will get the position where the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  impose duty on  intoxicating  liquor,\r\n\r\ntobacco and petroleum by virtue of sub-clause (1). And\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  also impose duty on  any  goods  made\r\n\r\ndutiable on import or manufacture, and such goods need\r\n\r\nnot  be goods which come under sub-clause (2).  So  we\r\n\r\nget to the position where we have three categories  of\r\n\r\ngoods - intoxicating liquor, tobacco and petroleum;  any\r\n\r\ngoods made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndutiable  on  import or manufacture; and  any  goods\r\n\r\nmade dutiable under sub-clause (2). But we could quite\r\n\r\neasily delete the whole of the clause and say -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There shall be charged, levied and paid to the\r\n\r\nComptroller such customs duties on any goods as may be\r\n\r\nprescribed  by  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  by  order\r\n\r\npublished in the Gazette.';\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>because the greater must include the, less. \"Any goods\r\n\r\nmade  dutiable  on  import  or  manufacture\"  is   the\r\n\r\ngreater.  Therefore,  it must  include  the  less,  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of which a report has been submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister is with me up to now, then I think he\r\n\r\nwill  agree with me, Sir, because he has said  in  his\r\n\r\nreply on the Second Reading that the intention of the\r\n\r\nGovernment, is not to impose duty on goods in  respect\r\n\r\nof   which  the  public  have  not  been  allowed  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to make their representations. Subject  to\r\n\r\nwhat the Minister has to say. Mr Speaker, I think the\r\n\r\nintention  was not to extend this new Bill beyond  the\r\n\r\nambit of the existing law. Perhaps this has been wrong\r\n\r\ndrafting, and I will therefore let the Minister  speak\r\n\r\non that for the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In regard to the imposition of new\r\n\r\nduties,  it  is  as I have said in my  Second  Reading\r\n\r\nspeech.

Briefly the  procedure\r\n\r\nis  that after the declaration under section 5 of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance that the land is needed for a public purpose\r\n\r\nor  for a Company under Part VII of the Ordinance, the\r\n\r\nCollector of Land Revenue causes notices to be  posted\r\n\r\nat  convenient places on or near the land to be taken,\r\n\r\nstating that the Government intends to take possession\r\n\r\nof  the  land and that claims to compensation for  all\r\n\r\ninterests  therein  may be made to  him.  This  notice\r\n\r\nunder section 8 (1) of the Ordinance fixes a date  for\r\n\r\nthe   enquiry,   not  earlier  than  21   days   after\r\n\r\npublication of the notice.

Secondly, to empower  the\r\n\r\nMinister to appoint to the Telephone Board persons who\r\n\r\nare   in   the   public  service  when  suitable   for\r\n\r\nappointment.  And thirdly, to impose  the  payment  of\r\n\r\nstamp duties on the Telephone Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Audit, Singapore, at present is not\r\n\r\nan  auditor within the definition under section  2  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Telephone  Board  Ordinance,  although\r\n\r\nunder  a different Ordinance, the Audit Ordinance,  he\r\n\r\nis  empowered  to  audit the accounts  of  any  public\r\n\r\nauthorities and bodies administering public funds. The\r\n\r\nfee  for  such  audit in each case is charged  to  the\r\n\r\nauthority   or   body  concerned.  By   amending   the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  \"auditor\"  under  section  2  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Telephone Board Ordinance, the Director  of\r\n\r\nAudit  is  now  authorised to act as auditor  for  the\r\n\r\nTelephone Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of section 5 (2) of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  no  person in the public  service  of  the\r\n\r\nState  can  be appointed to the Telephone Board.

Its  loan  and\r\n\r\nother operations in the immediate postwar period  have\r\n\r\nhelped  to set many countries on their way to economic\r\n\r\nrecovery from the aftermath of war. The major economic\r\n\r\nproblem  and  challenge  to the  world  today  is  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of the less developed countries  in  Asia\r\n\r\nand  Africa. In seeking to provide development finance\r\n\r\nto  these less developed countries, the World Bank  is\r\n\r\nat, times circumscribed by certain provisions in  its\r\n\r\nArticles  of Agreement. For instance, the  Bank  would\r\n\r\nonly   make   loans  for  specific  revenue  producing\r\n\r\nprojects,  and it also requires loans to be repaid  in\r\n\r\nstrong currencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to meet more specifically the needs of\r\n\r\nless  developed  countries,  a  new  body  called  the\r\n\r\nInternational Development Association has been formed.\r\n\r\nBy  15th September, less than a week ago, its Articles\r\n\r\nof    Association   would   have   been   signed    by\r\n\r\nrepresentatives    of   member    Governments    whose\r\n\r\nsubscriptions  would have totalled more  than  65  per\r\n\r\ncent of its overall initial capital of $3,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion.  The  purposes  of  the  Association  are  to\r\n\r\npromote  economic  development, increase  productivity\r\n\r\nand  thus  raise  standards  of  living  in  the  less\r\n\r\ndeveloped  areas  of  the world  included  within  the\r\n\r\nAssociation's membership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would it carry out its stated aims and in what\r\n\r\nways would it be different from its older partner, the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank?  Firstly, the Association would  seek  to\r\n\r\nprovide  long-term development loans at low  rates  of\r\n\r\ninterest  or  even  free  of interest.  Secondly,  the\r\n\r\nAssociation  would shape its financing to meet  actual\r\n\r\nneeds  of countries as they arise. For example, though\r\n\r\nthe   Association  is  required  to  finance  specific\r\n\r\nprojects, which is a criterion based on the sound  and\r\n\r\ntried principles of the World Bank, provisions in  its\r\n\r\nArticles allow the Association to finance any projects\r\n\r\nwhich  are  of high developmental priority,  that  is,\r\n\r\nprojects which will make an important contribution  to\r\n\r\ndevelopment of areas whether or not such projects  are\r\n\r\nrevenue  producing or directly productive.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nprojects  such  as water supply, sanitation  or  pilot\r\n\r\nhousing  which would not qualify for finance from  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank,  would be eligible for financing  by  the\r\n\r\nAssociation.  Thirdly, in the case of loans  from  its\r\n\r\nfreely  convertible fund of currencies, repayment  can\r\n\r\nbe  either  wholly or partly made in local currencies.\r\n\r\nThis is of advantage to borrowing countries which  are\r\n\r\nfaced  with  the  balance of payments  problem.  Thus,\r\n\r\nthough  the Association has been formed on  the  sound\r\n\r\nprinciples of its older associate, the World Bank, the\r\n\r\nAssociation  would  be  a more  liberal  and  flexible\r\n\r\ninternational financing agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership of the Association is open only to World\r\n\r\nBank  members.  However, as Singapore is  a  territory\r\n\r\nwhere  international relations are the  responsibility\r\n\r\nof  the  United  Kingdom Government,  she  would  have\r\n\r\naccess  to  the  resources of  the  Association  under\r\n\r\nsection  3  of  Article  XI of  its  Agreement,  which\r\n\r\nprovides that -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By its signature of this Agreement, each Government\r\n\r\naccepts  it  both on its own behalf and in respect  of\r\n\r\nall territories for whose international relations such\r\n\r\nGovernment is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsible except those which are excluded by such\r\n\r\nGovernment by written notice to the Association.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only obligations falling on a territory whose\r\n\r\ninternational  relations are the responsibility  of  a\r\n\r\nmember Government, namely, the U.K. Government in  our\r\n\r\ncase,   are  those  of  giving  the  Association   the\r\n\r\nimmunities and privileges set out in Article  VIII  of\r\n\r\nthe Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Development Association Bill has\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced  to  so  grant  the  Association  the\r\n\r\nprivileges  and immunities as set out in the  Schedule\r\n\r\nto  the Bill.

However, since we have  amended\r\n\r\nour  citizenship laws to confine Singapore citizenship\r\n\r\nonly  to those who really belong to Singapore and have\r\n\r\ngiven it their undivided loyalty and allegiance, it is\r\n\r\nconsidered  that we should also bring  our  banishment\r\n\r\nlaw  into  line  with  this  conception  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore citizenship must transcend all other\r\n\r\nloyalties  and citizenships in Singapore,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nonly just and proper that only a Singapore citizen has\r\n\r\nthe  right  to  be here, and that the Government  must\r\n\r\nretain the right to banish or expel from its territory\r\n\r\nanyone who is a danger to the State, unless he has the\r\n\r\nright  to  be  in  Singapore as a  Singapore  citizen.\r\n\r\nTherefore, while the present banishment procedures  as\r\n\r\nlaid  down  in  the existing Ordinance have  not  been\r\n\r\namended   since   these  procedural   provisions   are\r\n\r\nconsidered appropriate and satisfactory for conditions\r\n\r\nin Singapore, the Ordinance is being amended to enable\r\n\r\nthe  Government to banish or expel any person, whether\r\n\r\nBritish subject or alien, whose subversive or criminal\r\n\r\nactivities make him an undesirable resident and  whose\r\n\r\ncontinued  stay in the State is not conducive  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  good, unless he has the right to  be  here  by\r\n\r\nvirtue of his being a Singapore citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has to be ever vigilant and resolute\r\n\r\nagainst any disruptive force undermining the authority\r\n\r\nand  the  well-being of the State, and  banishment  or\r\n\r\nexpulsion is one of the weapons we must have  in  this\r\n\r\nfight,  where criminals and other undesirable elements\r\n\r\nopposing  the  State and its laws  are  not  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.

Now it is up to  them  to\r\n\r\nexplain  their actions and what is more  important  to\r\n\r\nshow  that they have not arrested innocent people.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Government thinks that because some of these  men\r\n\r\narrested have opposed us in the past we are not  going\r\n\r\nto  fight  for  their rights under the law,  they  are\r\n\r\nmistaken.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Going on to col. 2606, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Those who fought with us on the agreed Party policy\r\n\r\nwe  stand by.

As  the  months passed by, and as  victory  was\r\n\r\nalmost in sight on the horizon, and the post of  Prime\r\n\r\nMinistership was within striking distance due  to  the\r\n\r\nactive   support   of  the  unions  and   other   mass\r\n\r\norganisations on the one hand and the concrete work of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. in the City Council on the other, the basic\r\n\r\nstand taken by the Prime Minister in November 1956 and\r\n\r\nin September 1957 was gradually and skillfully altered\r\n\r\nstep  by step. I will only quote the major shifts  and\r\n\r\nchanges  in the basic stand of the Prime Minister.  On\r\n\r\nthe  4th  of December, 1958, which was not long  after\r\n\r\nthe  victorious Kallang by-election and the P.A.P. was\r\n\r\nthen  recognised even by its enemies as the  party  of\r\n\r\nthe  masses and victory was already assured, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  said in this Assembly, in Hansard,  Vol.  3,\r\n\r\nNo.   12,  col.  1188 - Mr  Speaker,  please  note  the\r\n\r\nalteration in the Prime Minister's basic stand -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is only one point\r\n\r\nworth  answering,  and it is the  question  which  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  has posed me about my ex-comrades  in\r\n\r\nChangi. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one thing about the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. which perhaps those who form, uniform and  re-form political Parties do not understand. When we form\r\n\r\na  Party,  there  are certain abiding principles  that\r\n\r\nbind us together. They were my comrades in 1954 when I\r\n\r\nformed that Party. They are my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomrades  now  in 1958. They will be my comrades  next\r\n\r\nyear.  If  and  when  anyone departs  from  the  Party\r\n\r\nprogramme and Party policy, then he ceases  to  be  my\r\n\r\ncomrade.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are a lot of adjectives and a lot of qualifications from now onwards. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\ndistinction  is now being made between  detainees  who\r\n\r\nare  P.A.P. members and detainees who are not  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers. I am only quoting extracts of speeches of the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  and it is not  my  purpose  here  to\r\n\r\nimpute   that  there  are  improper  or  dishonourable\r\n\r\nintentions  or motives on his part. Let  me  give  one\r\n\r\nexample  so  that this change in basic  stand  can  be\r\n\r\nbetter understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, allow me to take the case of Soon Loh Boon. When the Prime Minister required the active\r\n\r\nsupport of Soon Loh Boon, who was the President of the\r\n\r\nChinese  Middle  School  Students  Union,  before  his\r\n\r\ndetention  in  October 1956, the Prime  Minister  even\r\n\r\ntook  the troub1e of escorting Soon Loh Boon  home.  He\r\n\r\nparked  his  Studebaker by the  roadside  in  Hillside\r\n\r\nDrive  and  slowly escorted him home. I understand  he\r\n\r\nnow refuses to grant interviews to the parents of Soon\r\n\r\nLoh Boon now that he has become the Prime Minister,  I\r\n\r\ncan quote more of such examples. Believe me, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  will  still offer such courtesies  any  time\r\n\r\nwhen  he  requires  the  services  of  any  particular\r\n\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what is the effect of this skilful change? As I have said, for illustration I have taken\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  Soon  Lob Boon. In his  speech  of  5th\r\n\r\nNovember,  1956,  the Prime Minister  fought  for  the\r\n\r\nrights  of  Soon Loh Boon. But in his  speech  of  4th\r\n\r\nDecember,  1958 - remember that this was after  all  the\r\n\r\nwork in the City Council when he was equipping himself\r\n\r\nto  become the Prime Minister - Soon Loh Boon  had  been\r\n\r\nplaced under a different category because he was not a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. member.  Now, there had been  brought  in  two\r\n\r\ncategories of detainees compared to September 1957, or\r\n\r\nOctober 1956. P.A.P. members and non-P.A.P. members - in\r\n\r\nother  words,  detainees who are  P.A.P. members  and\r\n\r\ndetainees who are non-P.A.P. members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, however, as the days passed by very quickly and as V-Day was approaching nearer and\r\n\r\nnearer, a further distinction was being made.  It  was\r\n\r\nthe 22nd of May, 1959, which was a week before polling\r\n\r\nday.  It  was at the height of the election  campaign,\r\n\r\nwhen  the P.A.P. was already confident of at least  40\r\n\r\nseats.  It  was then stated that the P.A.P. would  not\r\n\r\ntake  office  unless former members of the  Party  who\r\n\r\nwere  intimately connected with the Central  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee and who were then in gaol were released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, note the change. There are now\r\n\r\nthree  categories  of  detainees.  Firstly,  in  class\r\n\r\nnumber  one  are  P.A.P. members intimately  connected\r\n\r\nwith  the  P.A.P.  Central, most  of  them  ex-Central\r\n\r\nmembers; secondly, class number two, detainees who are\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members, but not so intimately connected  with\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Central; and thirdly, Mr Speaker,  class\r\n\r\nnumber  three,  non-P.A.P. detainees. Mr  Speaker,  I\r\n\r\nshall  just quote an example to illustrate  again  the\r\n\r\ndifference.  For instance, take the case  of  Tan  Bok\r\n\r\nTeng,  who  I remember was the Chairman of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar Branch. His rights would have gone through\r\n\r\nthese  different  stages, three different  periods  of\r\n\r\ntransmutation,  in  the skilful but systematic  toning\r\n\r\ndown of the basic stand of the Prime Minister which he\r\n\r\nhad  taken in the two purges. It is necessary to quote\r\n\r\nextensively from Hansard and elsewhere former speeches\r\n\r\nof  the Prime Minister to show the rightward trend  of\r\n\r\nthe  political  stand of our Prime  Minister;  and  in\r\n\r\norder  to refute any argument he may make that he  had\r\n\r\nfought  for  these detainees in the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil, Mr Speaker, of which I was a member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all this, one can notice the pattern of the\r\n\r\ntrend  in  the political stand of our Prime  Minister.\r\n\r\nDuring  the  first  meeting of the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  on 28th August, 1959, I made my stand  clear.\r\n\r\nThe  motion  in  my name today was my  stand  at  that\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council meeting: the detainees  must\r\n\r\nbe  released.  Since that meeting, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  made  it clear that he, being the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nand the person\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  appoints  or  removes  the  other  two  Singapore\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Internal Security Council, only  shall\r\n\r\nspeak.  Mr Speaker, he is His Almighty the  power  to\r\n\r\nbe! Let me refer to section 64 (1) which describes the\r\n\r\norganisation  and the representation of  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There shall be in and for Singapore an Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council (in this Part referred  to  as  \"the\r\n\r\nCouncil\") which, subject to the provisions of  section\r\n\r\n70  of  this  Order, shall consist  of  the  following\r\n\r\nmembers:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the United Kingdom Commissioner, as Chairman;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Prime Minister;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) two members appointed to the Council by the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom Commissioner;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) two members, being Ministers, appointed to the\r\n\r\nCouncil by the Prime Minister; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) a member appointed in accordance with the\r\n\r\nprovisions of subsection (1) of section 70 of this\r\n\r\nOrder.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, it is clear that the Prime  Minister  is the  sole  authority  for Singapore  in  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council. As a matter of fact, in  the  later\r\n\r\nmeetings  of  the  Internal Security  Council,  I  was\r\n\r\n\"advised\" by the Prime Minister not to attend meetings\r\n\r\nof the Internal Security Council and that the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  would take my place. My presence - despite\r\n\r\nthe fact that it was a mute presence - had proved to  be\r\n\r\ntoo  embarrassing  for our Prime  Minister.  There  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely  no doubt in my mind of the  stand  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister.   There   were   never   any   prior\r\n\r\nconsultations  by  the  Prime Minister  with  his  two\r\n\r\ncolleagues   before  the  meetings  of  the   Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity   Council.  There  were   never   any   prior\r\n\r\nconsultations with the Cabinet. There were  never  any\r\n\r\nprior   consultations  with  the   Central   Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  of the People's Action Party.  I  tried  to\r\n\r\nbring  the  Central Executive Committee of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ninto  the  picture by making it a principle  that  all\r\n\r\nGovernment  business must first be  discussed  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral   Executive  Committee.  The   principle   was\r\n\r\naccepted  but,  Mr Speaker, never practised.  I  also\r\n\r\ntold the Chairman of the People's Action Party that  I\r\n\r\nwas   unhappy  about  the  position  in  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity   Council  and  that  all  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil matters must first\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  discussed  in  the  Cabinet  and  in  the  Central\r\n\r\nExecutive Committee of the People's Action Party.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  it  was  a  hopeless  position.  In  a\r\n\r\npolitical  party only when the rank and file  of  that\r\n\r\npolitical party could exercise its political  thinking\r\n\r\non  the  leader  who is now enjoying all  the  earthly\r\n\r\nbenefits of a Prime Minister could the political stand\r\n\r\nof  the  leader of that political party be subject  to\r\n\r\nthe  collective will of the rank and file. The members\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. tried to do it  at  a  Special  Party\r\n\r\nConference,  but the result is now too well  known  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the question of these political detainees - on this issue - we have gone through four\r\n\r\nfights  or  four  rounds.  The  first  round  was  the\r\n\r\nInternal  &  Security Council meeting on 28th  August,\r\n\r\n1959,  and a week later on 4th September, 1959  (which\r\n\r\nwas  a Friday), I was subject to the first of a series\r\n\r\nof  secret trials for which the Prime Minister is  now\r\n\r\nfamous.  The  second  round did  not  develop  into  a\r\n\r\ncrisis.  The  attempt to bring the  Central  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  into  the affairs of the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  failed.  The third round was  in  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nSpecial  Party  Conference on  19th  June,  1960.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  today  is the fourth  round,  in  this\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  there is now no more in him the anti-colonial\r\n\r\nfight. The British have been forced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   grant   certain  constitutional  concessions   as\r\n\r\nembodied in the 1958 Singapore Constitution because of\r\n\r\nthe  mass participation of all sections of the  people\r\n\r\nin  the  anti-colonial struggle. Out of one  phase  of\r\n\r\nthis anti-colonial struggle, a new Government under  a\r\n\r\nnew  Constitution  was formed in June  1959,  but  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  the common fight against the British  came\r\n\r\nout  in  striking contrast for different  people.  The\r\n\r\nanswers  to  the  questions asked by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAljunied  (Mr S. V. Lingam) are still  fresh  in  our\r\n\r\nminds, Mr Speaker. Some are now enjoying life to  the\r\n\r\nutmost,  having enormous political \"power\" and immense\r\n\r\nsocial   \"prestige\",  driving  about  in   fleets   of\r\n\r\nchauffeur-driven  cars  with  ample   bodyguards   and\r\n\r\nescorts, with State flags fluttering in the wind, with\r\n\r\nspecial  Traffic Police on duty at strategic junctions\r\n\r\nto   enable   \"S1\"  to  glide  and  pass  by   without\r\n\r\nobstruction.

Could I refresh the memories  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this House as to what the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I may not always have agreed with some of my friends\r\n\r\nwho are now in prison in Changi but I agreed with them\r\n\r\non  one  thing: the determination to wreck the present\r\n\r\ncolonial system as soon as possible.

So we have\r\n\r\none  of  the  most  expensive Prime Ministers  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  His extravagant expenditure on great  luxuries\r\n\r\nand  comfort  comes  from the pay cuts  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants  and from the taxes on the poor which  should\r\n\r\nall  be  devoted  to  building  more  roads, clinics,\r\n\r\nschools, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have brought in what the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said on the occasion of the two great purges,\r\n\r\nand  I have related how he has shifted his stand  most\r\n\r\nskillfully - like  a professional lawyer - so  that  there\r\n\r\nare now three categories of detainees. He has tried to\r\n\r\nprove  that  he  has no obligation to the  second  and\r\n\r\nthird classes of detainees, I have also tried to  give\r\n\r\nan  account  to this House of the two very  strikingly\r\n\r\ndifferent  results for two sets of people  fighting  a\r\n\r\ncommon enemy - the British colonialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, arising from this debate, it is\r\n\r\nonly  decent that the Prime Minister who is today  the\r\n\r\nguest  of honour of British colonial governors  should\r\n\r\nfight  for the immediate and unconditional release  of\r\n\r\nthese political detainees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have to enquire, of course, whether or\r\n\r\nnot  the  hon.

Although we do not  agree  with\r\n\r\ntheir  tactics  but because we believe  in  truth  and\r\n\r\njustice, we must request the unconditional release  of\r\n\r\nthese  arrested  political  detainees.  Let  us  speak\r\n\r\nfrankly.  Without  these  people  who  supported   the\r\n\r\nstruggle against the British colonialists and  without\r\n\r\nthe  success of the P.A.P.'s work in the City Council,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister would not be holding the  position\r\n\r\nhe  now  holds today. What has he shown to secure  his\r\n\r\npresent  position? In the past, the colonial Governors\r\n\r\nwere  the  objects of his attack but now these  people\r\n\r\nare  his  hosts. Those detained by him were  political\r\n\r\nworkers.  The Mayor of the City Council, Mr  Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan,  was his good friend, but now the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nattacks  him. When he needs a person to help him,  his\r\n\r\npurpose  is  to make use of such a person  to  benefit\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has now cut\r\n\r\nhimself off from the people who were once on his side.\r\n\r\nFor example, Mr Soon Loh Boon. The Prime Minister was\r\n\r\nonce   the  adviser  to  the  Chinese  Middle   School\r\n\r\nStudents' Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Prime Minister wants to face\r\n\r\nthe  people,  he  must fight in the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  for the release of these political detainees.\r\n\r\nToday he must make his stand clear in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  first let me on behalf of the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ndisabuse the mind of the Member for Hong Lim that  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister is afraid to attend the debate today to\r\n\r\nexchange  cudgels  with him. The invitation  from  the\r\n\r\nSultan  of Brunei to the Prime Minister was fixed  for\r\n\r\ntoday. Today's sitting of the Assembly was fixed  last\r\n\r\nmonth.  If  the Member for Hong Lim had given  earlier\r\n\r\nnotice  that he was going to move this motion,  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  him  that the Prime Minister would  have  been\r\n\r\nonly too glad to alter the date for today's sitting so\r\n\r\nas  to  be present and to listen to all that has  been\r\n\r\nuttered against the person of the Prime Minister.  And\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  inform the House  that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  had urged me to postpone today's sitting  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  so  that he could  be  present  at  the\r\n\r\ndebate,  but as Leader of the House I had to  consider\r\n\r\nthe fact that last month we had announced that we were\r\n\r\ngoing  to  move  a  number of Bills  today  and  so  I\r\n\r\nproceeded  with  today's sitting. I would  assure  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong Lim that he should thank  his  lucky\r\n\r\nstars  that  the Prime Minister is not present  today,\r\n\r\notherwise he would be at the receiving end of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, at the sitting of the Assembly on 14th October last year, I made a statement on the internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  position  and  our  relationship  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation  on behalf of the Singapore Government.  In\r\n\r\nthat  statement, I clarified to the House the  rights,\r\n\r\npowers and duties of the Internal Security Council and\r\n\r\nour part in the Internal Security Council of which the\r\n\r\nFederation Government is a member. If you will  permit\r\n\r\nme,  Mr  Speaker,  let  me refresh  the  memories  of\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House, and in particular the memories\r\n\r\nof the Member for Hong Lim and the Member for Punggol,\r\n\r\non  the  role  of  the  Singapore  Government  in  the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security  Council.  In  Hansard   of   14th\r\n\r\nOctober, 1959, Vol. 11, No. 11, at column 660, I said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The competence of the Singapore Government to\r\n\r\nformulate and implement the policy affecting  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  is subject to the overriding powers  of  the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to consultation and decisions on\r\n\r\nquestions of policy, the Internal Security Council  is\r\n\r\ncompetent   to  make  executive  decisions   for   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of internal security in Singapore, and any\r\n\r\nsuch  decision  which  has been  communicated  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government must be given immediate effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government is competent to take\r\n\r\nexecutive  action on its own authority in  matters  of\r\n\r\ninternal security. For its part, the Internal Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  is competent to take decisions in these  same\r\n\r\nmatters, and in so far as it does those decisions,  by\r\n\r\nvirtue   of   section  66,  paragraph  (2),   endorse,\r\n\r\nsupplement  or  override  any  decisions   which   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government may itself have taken -'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Let  me  repeat  the  words  \"endorse,  supplement  or\r\n\r\noverride  any decisions which the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nmay itself have taken ...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...and constitute binding directives with which toe\r\n\r\nsubsequent  decisions  and actions  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment must conform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government should not take any action\r\n\r\nin any field which would be contrary to policy already\r\n\r\nagreed  by, or decisions already taken by, the Council\r\n\r\nor  would  be likely to raise policy issues, or  would\r\n\r\nhave   repercussions   affecting  internal   security,\r\n\r\nwithout prior reference to the Council.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What I have just said was fully endorsed by the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Hong   Lim,   the   ex-Minister   for   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,   when  he  stood  up  to   support   the\r\n\r\nPreservation  of  Public  Security  (Amendment)   Bill\r\n\r\nintroduced by the Prime Minister. Ninety-five per cent\r\n\r\nof his speech on that day as well as today was devoted\r\n\r\nto  a lengthy quotation of what the Prime Minister had\r\n\r\nsaid  at that time in the Opposition in this House  in\r\n\r\nOctober  1958, We know that the Prime Minister  has  a\r\n\r\ntape-recorder but not until the Member  for  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nand  his  two colleagues moved over to the  Opposition\r\n\r\nBenches did we know that the Prime Minister also keeps\r\n\r\na  parrot.

The only\r\n\r\ncontribution by the Member for Hong Lim to the  debate\r\n\r\non  the  Preservation  of Public Security  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill, recorded in the same Vol. 11, No. 11, col.  673,\r\n\r\nwas this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is being fully recognised, under the new\r\n\r\nConstitution  granted  to  Singapore  by  the  British\r\n\r\nmasters, that the decisive say in internal security in\r\n\r\nthis Island is the Internal Security Council.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>When  he uttered those words, the Member for Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nwas  one  of three members representing the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the Internal Security Council.  It  was\r\n\r\nhis  experience in the Internal Security Council which\r\n\r\nled  him  to  conclude that the decisive  say  in  the\r\n\r\ninternal  security of Singapore rests on the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council and not on any single member  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil.  Or does he wish to say now that the decision\r\n\r\nof  the  Internal Security Council rests on the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  only,  or on the Minister for  Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nonly, or on him, Mr Ong Eng Guan, the third member of\r\n\r\nthe  Internal Security Council? If the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim  wishes  to place the responsibility of  decisions\r\n\r\ntaken  by the Internal Security Council solely on  any\r\n\r\nsingle  person,  then  surely the responsibility  must\r\n\r\nalso rest on him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Member for Hong Lim has not demonstrated\r\n\r\nany   great   love   for  collective  leadership   and\r\n\r\ncollective  action, I am quite sure  he  will  be  the\r\n\r\nfirst  person  to deny that his role in  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council was an individualistic role.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  that the Singapore Government has not fought  for\r\n\r\nthe  release of those detained under the Lim Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It was I who said those words  quoted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim a moment ago - that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwould  not  take office unless former members  of  the\r\n\r\nParty  who were intimately connected with the  Central\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee and who were then  in  gaol  were\r\n\r\nreleased. We can be responsible only to our colleagues\r\n\r\nand to those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  work  with us. We cannot be responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of those unknown to us, or be  responsible\r\n\r\nto  those who carry out activities for which  we  have\r\n\r\nnot given any request to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have fulfilled our pledge to release those members\r\n\r\nof the Central Executive. Committee who were detained.\r\n\r\nThere  were eight of them, and at our insistence,, on\r\n\r\n4th  June they were released before we assumed  office\r\n\r\non  5th June. On 1st June, 1959, immediately after the\r\n\r\nelections  and  before  forming  the  Government,  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of  the  Party,, now   the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,   stated  that  the  record  of  the   other\r\n\r\ndetainees  would be reviewed and justice done  on  the\r\n\r\nmerits, of each case. There were 60 persons  detained\r\n\r\non  2nd  June, 1959. From the day the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty  assumed office,, 3rd June, 1959, up to date  32\r\n\r\npersons  have  been  released.  Of  those  who   were\r\n\r\ndetained  by  the previous Government, there  are  now\r\n\r\nonly  28 persons still under detention. It is not that\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government has not reviewed the records\r\n\r\nof  these  detainees.  In fact, these  detainees  have\r\n\r\nwritten letters to the Prime Minister. However, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  for the Prime Minister alone, or for that  matter\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government, to release these detainees.\r\n\r\nIt   is  the  Internal  Security  Council  whom  these\r\n\r\ndetainees, must  convince  that  they  are  sincerely\r\n\r\nrenouncing  and repudiating the methods  and  aims  of\r\n\r\npolitical   forces   which  seek  to   overthrow   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic system not only of Singapore but of Malaya,\r\n\r\nby  means  of subversion and violence as a whole,  The\r\n\r\nefforts of the Singapore Government to work for  their\r\n\r\nrelease  will  be  in vain if the  attitude  of  these\r\n\r\ndetainees continues to be equivocal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recognise one simple fact. The Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment has been compelled today to adopt an  anti-Communist   stand   because  of   militant   Communist\r\n\r\ninsurrection.  After  passing  through  12  years   of\r\n\r\nEmergency,  it is hardly likely, therefore,  that  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government, who has the deciding  vote  in\r\n\r\nthe  Internal  Security Council,  will  agree  to  the\r\n\r\nrelease of those persons who, by their actions, it  is\r\n\r\nconvinced,  are  advancing the cause  of  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist Party. It is our business to look\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter  the welfare and well-being of the people  which\r\n\r\nwe  know can only be advanced through ultimate  merger\r\n\r\nwith   the   Federation.  We  have  no  intention   to\r\n\r\njeopardise  the welfare of the people as a  whole  for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of a small group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. was founded on a rising tide of\r\n\r\nnationalism  in Singapore. However, it  is  one  thing\r\n\r\nshouting  anti-colonial  slogans,  and  another  thing\r\n\r\nknowing how to fight in the present context the forces\r\n\r\nof  colonialism.  The  P.A.P. has  carried  the  fight\r\n\r\nagainst colonialism to the present stage, and today we\r\n\r\nhave  internal  self-government.  In  the  next  stage\r\n\r\nagainst colonialism, we will have to consider not only\r\n\r\nthe  prospects  of  political  independence  but  also\r\n\r\neconomic independence. If Singapore were the  size  of\r\n\r\nan island like Ceylon, or even the State of Johore, or\r\n\r\nPahang, the possibilities for a completely independent\r\n\r\nSingapore  exist. But it is not so, and therefore  the\r\n\r\nkey  to political as well as economic independence for\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a  merger  between  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation.   That  key  is  not  with   the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment  today,  but  it  is  with  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment, it is the Federation Government  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  the Federation whom we must convince  that\r\n\r\nmerger   with  Singapore  will  not  lead  to  Chinese\r\n\r\ndomination,  or  Communist  conquest  of  Malaya   and\r\n\r\noverthrow  of  the  Federation  Constitution.   Merger\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore  and the Federation  is  the  prime\r\n\r\nconsideration in our political thinking. And we  shall\r\n\r\nnot  allow  anybody  to disrupt the good  relationship\r\n\r\nwhich   we   have  established  with  the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment, or to endanger the prospects of a merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing that Singapore has in common with\r\n\r\nthe Federation, and that is that both territories have\r\n\r\na  parliamentary democratic system. It is because  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democratic system exists  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday  that  the Member for Aljunied can stand  up  in\r\n\r\nthis  House to ask the puerile questions that  he  has\r\n\r\nbrought  up  this  evening. But I do  not  credit  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Aljunied  with  even  that   degree   of\r\n\r\npuerility, and therefore we must believe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat he is only a mouthpiece.

We, being an elected Government and an anti-colonial    Party,    must   solemnly    answer    the\r\n\r\nquestion - should  we strive for the  release  of  those\r\n\r\ndetained  by the Lim Yew Hock Government for political\r\n\r\nreasons?  Our  reply is positive and  has  never  been\r\n\r\notherwise. As early as 14th\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober, 1959, the Deputy Prime Minister, when  making\r\n\r\na  policy  speech concerning the problem  of  national\r\n\r\nsafety and challenge from Communism, quoted the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and  pointed  out that  the  P.A.P. has  no\r\n\r\nintention  to  become the hand-maid of  the  Communist\r\n\r\nParty.  But we also do not have the intention to  soil\r\n\r\nour  hands  wearing the same gloves used  by  the  old\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our rebuttal of the so-called 16 resolutions by\r\n\r\nOng  Eng Guan on 22nd June, 1960, we again stated  our\r\n\r\nstand:  \"All  those  detained  by  the  Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment in the two purges should be released.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our stand on this problem is unchanged today. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government will still persistently request  for\r\n\r\ntheir release in the Internal Security Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are easily excited by this problem should\r\n\r\nweigh the Government by looking at concrete facts  and\r\n\r\nfigures. Of the 60 person detained by the Lim Yew Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  political  reasons,  32   have   been\r\n\r\nreleased  since the P.A.P. came into power.  Of  those\r\n\r\nstill  under detention, our attitude is still  this - to\r\n\r\ndeal with each case on its merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those within and without this House know that the\r\n\r\nkey to the release or the continued detention of these\r\n\r\npeople is held by the Federation representative to the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security  Council.  That  is  to  say,   the\r\n\r\ndecisive  factor is whether or not the  detainees  can\r\n\r\nsupply   sufficient  grounds  to  help  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  convince  the  Federation  representative,\r\n\r\nwhose vote is decisive on the matter. Unless we decide\r\n\r\nnot  to follow the peaceful and constitutional way  to\r\n\r\nfight for the ultimate aim of merger and independence,\r\n\r\nwe  must  accept  the limitation imposed  by  the  new\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Constitution does not give us the sovereignty\r\n\r\nand  liberty  necessary  for an  independent  country.\r\n\r\nEverybody  knows this. But since we have accepted  the\r\n\r\nnew  Constitution, no one can deny the fact  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore have pushed history towards  the\r\n\r\nright progressive path - the only correct path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has again raised the question\r\n\r\nof  political detainees. Will the release of political\r\n\r\ndetainees negative the constitutional struggle? If so,\r\n\r\nand   if   he  wants  to  be  considered  as  a   real\r\n\r\nrevolutionary,  then he ought to tell  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore in this House how bad and hopeless  the  new\r\n\r\nConstitution is and show them the way, the outcome and\r\n\r\nthe  prospect of such step. He should not merely  talk\r\n\r\nof  the release of the political detainees. If  he  is\r\n\r\nreally  earnest  in engaging in social revolution  and\r\n\r\nnot  pursuing his aim of individualistic heroism, then\r\n\r\nhe  should  persuade the people to follow him  in  his\r\n\r\ncause.  To  win  the  support  of  a  section  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  who  are  directly  concerned  with   those\r\n\r\npolitical detainees is not enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of releasing the\r\n\r\npolitical detainees, our policy is that the rights and\r\n\r\nwrongs  of every case should be dealt with in  a  just\r\n\r\nand fair way. But, if among those who are now detained\r\n\r\nthere   are  some  who  do  not  believe  in  peaceful\r\n\r\nconstitutional struggle and who harbour the design  of\r\n\r\nreplacing the democratic parliamentary system  with  a\r\n\r\nCommunist regime, then the P.A.P. has no obligation to\r\n\r\nfight for their release and their freedom. Even if  we\r\n\r\ndo  so,  we will not succeed in our endeavour. But  no\r\n\r\nmatter how, we will still endeavour to convince  these\r\n\r\npeople  to accept the idea of constitutional democracy\r\n\r\nto enable them to be released early.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of the three-cornered fight waged\r\n\r\nbetween  the Communists, the British colonialists  and\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P., the Prime Minister has dealt `with it very\r\n\r\nclearly at the last Assembly sitting. Of course,  what\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister said on the topic is not  pleasing\r\n\r\nto  the  ears  of  the  pro-Communists  and  Left-wing\r\n\r\nadventurers.  However,  I  think  they   should   seek\r\n\r\nsolutions to the problem in concrete reality  and  not\r\n\r\nbase their method on their subject wishful thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to point out that there was\r\n\r\nno such word as \"unconditional\" in the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim's motion proposed at the Party Conference in  June\r\n\r\nthis year. If at that time the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  were not confused by his slogan, the  addition\r\n\r\nof  the  word \"unconditional\" now would be of  no  use\r\n\r\nalso.  Another motive behind the Member for Hong Lim's\r\n\r\nmotion  was  to  put  the  entire  responsibility   of\r\n\r\nreleasing the political detainees on the shoulders  of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister, so as to show that his expulsion\r\n\r\nfrom  the Party arose out of his personal quarrel with\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister, and that he is the only person who\r\n\r\nis  really anti-colonialistic. Anyone who is  able  to\r\n\r\nsee  the  true  colour of his individualistic  heroism\r\n\r\nwill understand the real facts of the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I deem it necessary to\r\n\r\namend the motion proposed by the Member for Hong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>9.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, speaking on the\r\n\r\namendment,  I  was very glad to hear the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and Leader of the House speak in the  manner\r\n\r\nhe did this evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this country and in our neighbouring country,\r\n\r\nMalaya,   we   are  both  committed  to  a  democratic\r\n\r\nparliamentary  system,  and  the  objective   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment here and the Government across the Causeway\r\n\r\nis to work this democratic parliamentary system to the\r\n\r\nbest  of  both  our abilities. Anybody  who  seeks  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  this  system and to disrupt and  destroy  the\r\n\r\nState  is an enemy of the State. Therefore, the  State\r\n\r\nmust  take  action to see that it is not destroyed  by\r\n\r\nits  enemy. It is only with that intent and  for  that\r\n\r\npurpose that it then becomes rightful for a democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  such  as  ours to bring in such  an  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich  will  put  away  from society  people  who  are\r\n\r\nenemies of the State and who wish to destroy it. It is\r\n\r\non  those  grounds, and on those grounds  alone,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  an Ordinance like this is permissible in such  a\r\n\r\nsystem as we are seeking to operate. I think there can\r\n\r\nbe  no  doubt  in  the  mind of  any  Member  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  or  anybody outside, that  there  are  such\r\n\r\npersons in the Federation of Malaya and Singapore  who\r\n\r\nare  seeking  to  do  that.  In  those  circumstances,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   their   detentions  are   justified   and\r\n\r\njustifiable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original motion, Mr Speaker, Sir, dealt with\r\n\r\nonly  the question of detainees who were detained  .by\r\n\r\nthe  Lim  Yew  Hock Government. Since the P.A.P. came\r\n\r\ninto  power,  a  certain number of  people  have  been\r\n\r\ndetained  by the present Government - I do not know  the\r\n\r\nexact  number,  Mr Speaker, Sir. So  I  was  somewhat\r\n\r\ndisappointed when I read the motion by the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong Lim, who has specifically asked the Government to\r\n\r\nuse  its  best  endeavours in  the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  only for those detained by the Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, Mr Speaker, Sir, that on the last\r\n\r\noccasion when we met, the Member for Hong Lim was loud\r\n\r\nin  his  condemnation  of the  Government  for  having\r\n\r\ndetained  two  members of the Press.  They  were  also\r\n\r\ndetained  under  the  P.P.S.O.  Sir,  I  was  somewhat\r\n\r\nsurprised that the persons whom he had made use of for\r\n\r\nhis  own purposes in the debate against the Government\r\n\r\nhad conveniently been forgotten by him in this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister, in the course of his\r\n\r\nspeech, said that when the PAP, came into power  there\r\n\r\nwere  about  60 persons under detention,  having  been\r\n\r\ncommitted there by the Lim Yew Hock Government. I hope\r\n\r\nI  am  quoting the right figure, Sir - I think  he  said\r\n\r\nthat 32 have been released up to now and that 28 still\r\n\r\nremain  where they were. Sir, let us look at  it  this\r\n\r\nway.  Assuming that the P.A.P. did not agree with  the\r\n\r\nLim  Yew Hock Government that all 60 should have  been\r\n\r\ndetained   (on  the  basis  that  the  Lim  Yew   Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment had made a mistake), then I think  we  have\r\n\r\nnow  certainly  reached  the position  that,  on  21st\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1960, the P.A.P. Government does  certainly\r\n\r\nagree  that  in  so  far  as  the  28  detainees   are\r\n\r\nconcerned, the Lim Yew Hock Government had not made  a\r\n\r\nmistake; whatever its views may be on the other 32 who\r\n\r\nhad been detained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the amendment of the Government and I\r\n\r\nsupport it. But I think the amendment does not go  far\r\n\r\nenough.  I think the Government is taking the  correct\r\n\r\nview  that  if  the Lim Yew Hock Government  detainees\r\n\r\nmend their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nways  and satisfy the Government that their ways  have\r\n\r\nbeen  mended,  then,  of course, the  Government  will\r\n\r\nfight  for  their release. Sir, I think  the  position\r\n\r\nwhich applies to the Lim Yew Hock Government detainees\r\n\r\nshould  also apply, in all fairness, to the  detainees\r\n\r\nwho have been detained by the present Government. I do\r\n\r\nnot  think the Government can say, \"We will apply  one\r\n\r\nset of standards to those detained by the Lim Yew Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  another set of  standards  to  those\r\n\r\ndetained by us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Why not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Therefore, I say this to the Government:\r\n\r\nthe  only basis on which the 28 are being detained  is\r\n\r\nbecause  they are enemies of the State, and  the  only\r\n\r\nbasis  on  which the present Government  is  detaining\r\n\r\npeople   off   their  own  bat - if  I   may   use   the\r\n\r\ncolloquialism - is also because they are enemies of  the\r\n\r\nState.  So  if the 28 enemies of the State  previously\r\n\r\ndetained  by  the  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government  can  be\r\n\r\nmercifully  treated by the Government, the  Government\r\n\r\nshould   equally   treat  those   detained   by   them\r\n\r\nmercifully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I move an amendment\r\n\r\nto the amendment -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

However,\r\n\r\nI  was  completely  disappointed  and,  if  I  may  be\r\n\r\npermitted to recall his speech made just a few moments\r\n\r\nago, I might say that other than quoting a few remarks\r\n\r\nof  the Prime Minister, which he was wont to quote  at\r\n\r\nall  times, he was himself unable to make any  genuine\r\n\r\npolitical contribution by way of political statements.\r\n\r\nOther  than such repetitions and quotations, there  is\r\n\r\nreally nothing in the motion or in the speech that  he\r\n\r\nhas  made in respect of that motion. He does not  seem\r\n\r\nto  be aware or to be able to understand that with the\r\n\r\nachievement  of  independence  in  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  the  political analysis of this  country  has\r\n\r\nchanged.  Before the Federation achieved independence,\r\n\r\nit  was  our duty and our responsibility to fight  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists, to fight the British at all costs.  With\r\n\r\nthe  achievement of independence by the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  it  is our responsibility now  to  light  for\r\n\r\nmerger with the Federation if we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto accept that independence for Singapore alone is not\r\n\r\nviable  and  not  feasible, and that independence  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  come and will only come  after  merger\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation. The stress and the emphasis  of\r\n\r\nthe  fight has therefore changed. It is therefore  our\r\n\r\nduty to lead the people of Singapore to fight actively\r\n\r\nfor  a  merger  and  not  for  quixotic  pursuits   as\r\n\r\nsuggested by the Member for Hong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have exposed the Member for Hong Lim for trying to\r\n\r\nembarrass and discredit the Government in any  way  he\r\n\r\ncan for little transient advantages.

I  was  merely\r\n\r\ntrying  to  show  him  that the basic  stand  has  not\r\n\r\nchanged, but that the circumstances have changed.  The\r\n\r\npolitical  objectives of the P.A.P. have  never  been\r\n\r\nchanged and will never be changed. Yet the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong Lim is prepared to destroy this movement and  put\r\n\r\nthe clock back for many years to suit his own purpose.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of a revolutionist does he claim to be?

I think I must put a stop to\r\n\r\nthis. The Hon. Parliamentary Secretary is embarking on\r\n\r\na  debate  on the Member for Hong Lim. I do not  think\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly should debate the Member for Hong  Lim,\r\n\r\nas the Member for Hong Lim, in this particular motion.\r\n\r\nI  have indicated before that if that is to be done in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly, it must be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndone  by  a substantive motion. Let us try and confine\r\n\r\nourselves to the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you, Sir. I shall now read\r\n\r\nthe  original motion of the Member for Hong Lim  which\r\n\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly urges the Prime Minister to fight\r\n\r\nin the Internal Security Council for the unconditional\r\n\r\nrelease  of all political detainees who were  detained\r\n\r\nby the Lim Yew Hock Government.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Running  through this motion, we are able to  read  in\r\n\r\nand  between  the  lines the false premises  messed-up\r\n\r\nwith paranoic tendencies of a persecution complex. The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong Lim is still trying to persuade  the\r\n\r\npeople  that  his quarrel is not with the  P.A.P. but\r\n\r\nwith  the Prime Minister, as indicated by the  wording\r\n\r\nof   his   motion.  Perhaps  politicians  with  mental\r\n\r\naberrations  are unable to see their  true  selves  as\r\n\r\nothers  see  them. The Member for Hong Lim has  worded\r\n\r\nhis  motion with vengeance towards the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nin  a very personal way. He has intended the motion to\r\n\r\nbe  a  double-edged sword to cut deeply into the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister on the one hand, and into the front and  back\r\n\r\nbenchers  on this side of the House on the  other.  He\r\n\r\nhas  hoped to give the impression, through the motion,\r\n\r\nthat  the Prime Minister is the dictator of the Party,\r\n\r\nand  all the rest of us here are mere stooges. He  has\r\n\r\nalso aimed to discredit the Prime Minister in the eyes\r\n\r\nof the progressive elements and to embarrass the front\r\n\r\nand the back benchers when it comes to voting. We have\r\n\r\nseen  thoroughly through his mischief, and it  is  for\r\n\r\nthese  reasons, Sir, that the Leader of the House  has\r\n\r\namended  the motion to read the \"Government\" in  place\r\n\r\nof the \"Prime Minister\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is because when the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nwas  the Minister for National Development he  was  so\r\n\r\npreoccupied  with  his  selfish  schemes   of   empire\r\n\r\nbuilding  that  he  was  unable  to  believe  in  the\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  collective leadership.  Where  he  had\r\n\r\nhimself failed, he could not believe that others could\r\n\r\nsucceed.  Going through the original motion,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\ncan   see  glaring  and  deliberate  errors  both   of\r\n\r\ncommission\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand omission. As an ex-member of the Internal Security\r\n\r\nCouncil, the Member for Hong Lim must surely know  and\r\n\r\nmust   surely  realise  that  the  British   and   the\r\n\r\nFederation Governments have the decisive vote  in  the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security Council, and that however hard  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government fights in respect of the  release\r\n\r\nof  the  political  detainees, it would  be  in  vain,\r\n\r\nunless the British and the Federation Governments  are\r\n\r\nfully  satisfied,  `by the detainees themselves,  that\r\n\r\ntheir release would not be detrimental to the interest\r\n\r\nof the Federation of Malaya. Hence the amendment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.this Assembly endorses the Government's view that\r\n\r\nthe  detainees  should assist the  Government  in  its\r\n\r\nefforts   to   secure  their  release   by   sincerely\r\n\r\nrepudiating  the methods and aims of political  forces\r\n\r\ndedicated to the overthrow of the democratic system by\r\n\r\nsubversion and violence.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of deliberate errors of commission, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, cannot be forgiven. I might  add,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the original motion was worded to make it appear\r\n\r\nthat the Singapore Government had never fought for the\r\n\r\nrelease of the detainees. Nothing can be further  from\r\n\r\nthe  truth.  Even before the P.A.P. formed  Government\r\n\r\nthe  wheels  were  set in motion for  the  release  of\r\n\r\npolitical  detainees by the collective  leadership  of\r\n\r\nthe  Party.  It is indeed true to say that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nkept  its  promises  fully that it  would  not  assume\r\n\r\nGovernment unless and until our friends and colleagues\r\n\r\ndetained  by the previous Government were given  their\r\n\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last June, eight of our colleagues came out of Changi\r\n\r\ngaol. Since then we have unrelentingly fought for  the\r\n\r\nrelease of the remaining political detainees, and will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to fight for their release. And I  say  here\r\n\r\nthat all of us on this side of the House support full-heartedly the amendment of the Leader of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim may not be aware of the fact\r\n\r\nthat  since  June 1959, we have fought  for  and  have\r\n\r\nsecured the release of 32 political detainees cut of a\r\n\r\ntotal of 60. It is up to the detainees themselves  now\r\n\r\nto fight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  own battles, and to help themselves. I  believe\r\n\r\nthat they have no need for people like the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  to  fight, unsolicited, their  battles  for\r\n\r\nthem,  and  they  have indicated so  in  no  uncertain\r\n\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conspicuous and deliberate error of omission of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim lies in his failure to  state\r\n\r\nhis  stand  on  the most fundamental political  issue.\r\n\r\nWhen  he was with us in the People's Action Party,  he\r\n\r\nbelieved  in the creation of a democratic,  socialist,\r\n\r\nnon-Communist Malaya. Now that he has been expelled by\r\n\r\nthe Party, does he still believe in the creation of  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic, socialist, non-Communist Malaya,  and  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I challenge him to make his stand.  That\r\n\r\nis  important,  Sir, because that  is  the  basic  and\r\n\r\nfundamental political stand of any politician. And  if\r\n\r\nhe  still  believes in the creation of  a  democratic,\r\n\r\nsocialist,  non-Communist Malaya, let him  say  so  in\r\n\r\nthis   House,   Sir,  so  that  he   may   take   into\r\n\r\nconsideration his own political beliefs whenever he is\r\n\r\nstruck  by  the  anxiety to rant and to sensationalise\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he agrees that the creation of a democratic,\r\n\r\nsocialist,  non-Communist  Malaya  is  in   the   best\r\n\r\ninterest  of this country, then surely he  must  agree\r\n\r\nwith  us, Mr Speaker, Sir, that any power that  seeks\r\n\r\nto  overthrow this democratic system by subversion and\r\n\r\nby  violence  must  be squarely met and  boldly  dealt\r\n\r\nwith. He must, therefore, support the amendment of the\r\n\r\nLeader  of  the House, so ably reamended by  you,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir.

Having been expelled by the  P.A.P. from\r\n\r\nthe  left and being unacceptable to our friends on the\r\n\r\nopposite  benches who represent ineffective  political\r\n\r\nmovements  on the right, he has to crawl back  to  the\r\n\r\nvery  elements  who kicked him out of  the  P.A.P. in\r\n\r\n1957.

On  page 1, it  says  [Hansard,  14th\r\n\r\nOctober, 1959, col. 661]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We agreed to the provisions for an Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council in June 1957, giving the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  representative  a  deciding  vote  on  our\r\n\r\nSecurity Council, because we recognised that that  was\r\n\r\nbetter than giving the British Government the decisive\r\n\r\nsay and that, in fact, if we achieved independence  we\r\n\r\ncan only do so as a Member State of the Federation, in\r\n\r\nwhich  case  the Federation Government  would  have  a\r\n\r\ndecisive  voice  in  our  national  policies   anyway.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  until  independence  through   merger   is\r\n\r\nachieved,  we  accept the position of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  having  a deciding vote  in  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, today we are debating this question. The\r\n\r\nimportant point is this: when we struggled for  a  new\r\n\r\nConstitution, the Member for Hong Lim was at that time\r\n\r\nin  the P.A.P. He also agreed that we ought to use the\r\n\r\nConstitution as a stepping-stone to a new  stage.  But\r\n\r\nunfortunately  today our ex-colleague,  that  is,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong  Lim, completely ignored  the  basic\r\n\r\nsource of this problem. He did not point out the basic\r\n\r\nsource  of  the  problem. He only led  the  people  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  present  circumstances.  Concerning  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of the political detainees, I believe  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  necessary  for  me  to reiterate  what  my  Party\r\n\r\ncolleagues  outside the Assembly House have  expressed\r\n\r\non  our Party's stand. Being courageous and determined\r\n\r\nto  fight against colonialism, the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nought to analyse the real cause of the problem and  to\r\n\r\npoint  it  out.  He must not make this  a  superficial\r\n\r\nproblem, and he must not confuse the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon.

We are now debating the words which the Leader\r\n\r\nof  the House has proposed should be inserted. We have\r\n\r\ndone  with  the words which the Member  for  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nsought to include in his motion.

Here, I do not have anything to  add.\r\n\r\nFrom this amended motion, we can say that our attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  those political detainees detained under  the\r\n\r\nLim  Yew  Hock  Government is  very  clear.  From  the\r\n\r\nbeginning,  our attitude towards these  detainees  has\r\n\r\nbeen  clearly expressed by our colleagues. The release\r\n\r\nof  these  political  detainees  is  positively  being\r\n\r\nconsidered, but just now I have pointed out  that  the\r\n\r\nimportant  point at present is this. In  our  struggle\r\n\r\nfor constitutional self-government, we were restricted\r\n\r\nin  many  ways. At that time, we did not  receive  any\r\n\r\nmotion  or  criticism  by the  Member  for  Hong  Lim.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  being responsible socialists, we  must  be\r\n\r\nable to analyse clearly this problem, and to tell  the\r\n\r\npeople  the facts accordingly. If a person  now  shows\r\n\r\nhimself  to  be different from what he was many  years\r\n\r\nago, by his point of view and by his speeches, then he\r\n\r\nmay confuse the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople's  vision.

As far  as\r\n\r\nthe Government speeches are concerned, how I wish they\r\n\r\nwere made before the general elections!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's debate we have seen the two basic stands\r\n\r\ntaken  by  Assemblymen in this House. One of  them  is\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the  three of us which  is  stated  in  our\r\n\r\noriginal motion, which is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly urges the Prime Minister to fight\r\n\r\nin the Internal Security Council for the unconditional\r\n\r\nrelease  of all political detainees who were  detained\r\n\r\nby the Lim Yew Hock Government.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is our stand and it will always be our stand.\r\n\r\nThe other 48 Members have one common basic stand, that\r\n\r\nis,  the  detainees  should  be  released  subject  to\r\n\r\ncertain  conditions and qualifications.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this  is  a  further development  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  original stand in 1956 and 1957  which  I\r\n\r\nmade  in  the speech at the beginning of this  debate.\r\n\r\nThis  amendment is another alteration of or  deviation\r\n\r\nfrom their original political stand since October 1956\r\n\r\nand  September  1957. However, there  are  some  slight\r\n\r\ndifferences  of opinion between those Members  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  those  belonging  to  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nPeople's  Alliance.  There is no difference  in  their\r\n\r\nbasic political stand. The difference is shown in  the\r\n\r\namendment moved by the Member for Farrer Park. They do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  be  embarrassed by any mention  of  the\r\n\r\narrest of these detainees by their colleague, the  ex-Chief  Minister,  who  is at present  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think if the hon. Member wishes\r\n\r\nto mention it in passing, he is quite in order. But if\r\n\r\nhe wishes to expand on it, then, of course,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe is out of order. He should have expanded on it when\r\n\r\nthe  amendment was before the House. But he  can  just\r\n\r\nmention it in passing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The S.P.A. would vote today with\r\n\r\nthe  Government if it did not embarrass them too much.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I think I should have explained why\r\n\r\nthe  motion was to urge the Prime Minister instead  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government. It was because  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   made   all  the  decisions  without   prior\r\n\r\nconsultation with myself and the other member  on  the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security Council as far as I know,  nor  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government as represented in  the  Cabinet,\r\n\r\nnor  the People's Action Party as represented  by  the\r\n\r\nCentral  of the Party. That is why the motion  was  to\r\n\r\nurge  the  Prime  Minister instead  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It  was  because,  having  been  on   the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security Council for many  months,  I  found\r\n\r\nout,  to my great shock, that the Prime Minister  took\r\n\r\ndecisions,  some of which are of vital and fundamental\r\n\r\nimportance, without prior consultations. I just had to\r\n\r\nkeep quiet then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one issue brought up in my motion\r\n\r\ntoday  is  whether  the  Prime Minister  has,  on  the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security  Council,  ever  fought   for   the\r\n\r\nunconditional release of these detainees.  I  know  he\r\n\r\nhas  not. Excuses about merger with the Federation and\r\n\r\nthe  powers  of  the  Internal Security  Council  were\r\n\r\n\"good\" excuses, but I was long enough on the I.S.C. to\r\n\r\nwatch the antics of the Prime Minister there. There is\r\n\r\nno  doubt that many detainees have been released;  but\r\n\r\nas  we  all  know, they were released  on  conditions.\r\n\r\nThere  is no doubt that the Prime Minister fought  for\r\n\r\nthe release of those eight in category one: he had  no\r\n\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, mention has been made of my\r\n\r\npersonal conduct and I think I need reply in only  one\r\n\r\nsentence.  If I had wanted, I could have accepted  all\r\n\r\nthe  offers  of  trips overseas,  I  could  have  been\r\n\r\ncontented; remain Minister, with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  the departments under my control; that is,  if  I\r\n\r\nhad  decided from the beginning to go along with  them\r\n\r\nin  their pro-colonial course. The speeches which have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  by the Government Benchers show  that  the\r\n\r\ndepartures  are  very serious departures  indeed  from\r\n\r\ntheir  original stand. The issue today is not an issue\r\n\r\nof  whether the democratic system will survive or not.\r\n\r\nI  think  the  Government is trying to exaggerate  and\r\n\r\nshift  the  issue. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we  support  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system  and I believe  everybody  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point today is, as I have quoted at the beginning\r\n\r\nof  my  speech from Hansard, that these are the people\r\n\r\nwho  fought with the Prime Minister against  a  common\r\n\r\nenemy-the  British.  That was  before  the  Secretary-General  of the P.A.P. became the Prime Minister.  And\r\n\r\nwe  have two results for two sets of people. The issue\r\n\r\ntoday  is  a  question of honour. It is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\npeople   fighting  against  a  common  enemy  and   on\r\n\r\nprinciples that had often been enunciated by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in this Assembly. The Prime Minister  should\r\n\r\ncome  to their aid at this moment and fight for  their\r\n\r\nunconditional and immediate release, it is not as  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health has\r\n\r\nsaid, that it is now up to the detainees to fight  for\r\n\r\nthemselves, or as the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has said, to persuade,  convince  and\r\n\r\nbrainwash  these  people. The issue  is  primarily  an\r\n\r\nissue of honour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Tanglin that there are\r\n\r\ntwo  P.A.P.'s  in  this House. One is  the  P.A.P. in\r\n\r\npower,  which  is in name only and does not  represent\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. which was known to the masses before  the\r\n\r\ngeneral elections. The Member for Tanglin, without any\r\n\r\nhesitation, would support the P.A.P. in power on  this\r\n\r\nvital  issue if the amendment of the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  was  carried.  Mr Speaker,  we  are  the  other\r\n\r\nP.A.P., the P.A.P. not in power - the real P.A.P. as the\r\n\r\nmasses knew it before the general elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 29; Noes, 6; Abstentions, Nil; Absent, 16.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         Ayes.
