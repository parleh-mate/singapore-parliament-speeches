Mr Tay  and\r\n\r\nMr Zainul Abidin also wanted to know how the economic conditions\r\n\r\nof  Japan and other Asian countries would affect Singapore.  The\r\n\r\neffects  of the financial turmoil and developments in  Indonesia\r\n\r\nhave  yet to be fully played out.  The current outlook  for  the\r\n\r\nexternal  environment is therefore mixed.  While the US  and  EU\r\n\r\neconomic  growth remains healthy, the Asian economies have  come\r\n\r\nunder severe downward pressure.  In Japan, there are signs of a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsubstantial  slowdown but it will be ameliorated to some  extent\r\n\r\nby their recent fiscal stimulus package.  The economic situation\r\n\r\nin Thailand and South Korea appears to have stabilised somewhat.\r\n\r\nBut developments in Indonesia have increased volatility over the\r\n\r\nshort-term.  The overall picture is still one of uncertainty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee has also asked about the specific impact of the\r\n\r\nfinancial  turmoil on the economic forecast.  MTI's  GDP  growth\r\n\r\nforecast  of  2.5-4.5%  for 1998 has factored  in  the  regional\r\n\r\nfinancial turmoil, and its impact on the growth prospects of our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries.   But  as developments,  especially  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  have yet to stabilise, nobody can be  certain  about\r\n\r\nthe  full impact of the financial crisis on our economy at  this\r\n\r\npoint in time.  However, as the Singapore economy is fairly well\r\n\r\ndiversified, we are unlikely to slip into negative  growth  this\r\n\r\nyear  as  growth  will  be supported by the  relatively  healthy\r\n\r\nperformance in the US and EU economies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay, Dr Lee, Mr Chng Hee Kok, Mr Zainul Abidin and Mrs\r\n\r\nYu-Foo Yee Shoon have all asked about the implementation of off-Budget  measures.  As I have mentioned during the Budget debate,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will  implement further  measures  if  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  slows down significantly.  The Government is  monitoring\r\n\r\nthe  economy  very  closely.   In the  first  quarter  of  1998,\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  has  slowed to 5.6%.   Growth  in  the  second\r\n\r\nquarter  is  expected to moderate further  as  impact  from  the\r\n\r\nregional financial turmoil filters through the economy.  Non-oil\r\n\r\ndomestic  exports  have declined by 1.6% in April.   Preliminary\r\n\r\ndata  showed  it continued to drop by 6% in May.  We  will  soon\r\n\r\nknow how sharply the second quarter GDP growth has declined.  We\r\n\r\nwill  then decide if we should proceed with additional  measures\r\n\r\nto help the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance,  in  his  answer, said that the  Government  will  only\r\n\r\nconsider  implementing off-Budget measures if the economy  slows\r\n\r\ndown  significantly.  May I know from the Minister what does  he\r\n\r\nmean  by  \"significant slowdown\"?  What percentage is he looking\r\n\r\nat?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> A \"significant slowdown\" would mean\r\n\r\nthat it would be down to negative growth, for example.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is it for one quarter?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The standard definition of a\r\n\r\nrecession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister when will the second quarter results be known since the\r\n\r\nMinister  did say that off-Budget measures will be decided  only\r\n\r\nwhen the second quarter results are known?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> We will not know the full second\r\n\r\nquarter results until some time in July, but we do not expect to\r\n\r\nhave  to  wait quite that long.  I think by the middle  of  this\r\n\r\nmonth or towards the latter part of the month, we will know  the\r\n\r\nfull May results and that might give us sufficient indication of\r\n\r\nthe  forward trend.  The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister  for\r\n\r\nDefence,  Dr  Tony  Tan,  already indicated  that  we  might  do\r\n\r\nsomething before the full second quarter results are known.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may\r\n\r\nI  ask the Minister whether the number of those retrenched would\r\n\r\nbe considered as one of the significant factors before more off-Budget measures will be introduced?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Yes, of course, that would be a\r\n\r\nsignificant indication.  In fact, that reflects the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, will the Minister\r\n\r\nexplain  what  is  the  time frame by  which  measures  will  be\r\n\r\neffective the moment they are implemented?  In other words,  how\r\n\r\nlong   will  all  these  measures  that  he  has  in  mind,   if\r\n\r\nimplemented, take effect?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> It depends on the nature of the\r\n\r\nmeasures.   A  rebate, for example, will take place immediately.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure  spending will take some time to filter  through,\r\n\r\nagain,  depending on the type of spending which takes place.   A\r\n\r\ntax  cut  will not take place until next year.  So  there  is  a\r\n\r\nwhole package of measures\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  can  consider,  some  of which are  going  to  be  effective\r\n\r\nimmediately, and some are medium and longer term.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Taking into account the period when\r\n\r\nhistorical data is known and the measures which the Minister has\r\n\r\ntaken  into  account  in his basket of measures  which  he  will\r\n\r\nimplement when the economy slows down significantly, there  will\r\n\r\nbe a certain period of time for measures to take effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am not quite sure what he means.\r\n\r\nBut if we do something, for example - I am not promising this  - towards  the end of June or July, as I mentioned, if we announce\r\n\r\nthe  rebates  they would take place immediately other  than  the\r\n\r\ntime  for processing.  As for the other measures, it depends  on\r\n\r\nthe  nature of the actual cuts and the programmes.  So I  cannot\r\n\r\ngive  him  a precise figure.  But I am sure the Member  realises\r\n\r\nthat  we went through this experience in 1985/86 and it did  not\r\n\r\ntake us very long to recover although the circumstances, I would\r\n\r\nadmit, between now and 1985/86 are completely different.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, with regard to the impact of the\r\n\r\nrecent turmoil in Indonesia, surely the Minister will agree that\r\n\r\nthat  impact  would be negative in terms of the  impact  on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy.  To the extent that the growth  forecast  of\r\n\r\n2.5-4.5%  was  made earlier on this year and  the  situation  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  has since deteriorated, surely that would  mean  that\r\n\r\nthe growth forecast for Singapore, even if it remains within 2.5-4.5%, would actually hover around the lower end of the range  or\r\n\r\nthat the forecast range would be lower than 2.5-4.5%.

It  is  not  something which an outside  party,  like\r\n\r\nSingapore,  however well-intentioned, can make a big  difference\r\n\r\nto.

Perhaps the  great  powers\r\n\r\nlike  the US, maybe the EU, and perhaps Japan, if they similarly\r\n\r\nsignal  confidence, it would have some impact.

When we are\r\n\r\ntalking  about trade finance, the issue is the specific  parties\r\n\r\ninvolved.   There are specific banks involved, and  the  parties\r\n\r\nwhich  guarantee the banks.  Of course, if all that fails,  then\r\n\r\nfinally  it  becomes  a  sovereign debt  owed  by  Indonesia  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.

In fact, consumer\r\n\r\nprices rose by only 1.1% in the first quarter of 1998, down from\r\n\r\n1.7%  and  2.3%  in  the  first half and  second  half  of  1997\r\n\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThere  are three reasons for the low inflation.  First, although\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore dollar has depreciated against the US dollar,  it\r\n\r\nhas  strengthened against the regional currencies.  Overall, the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar  has remained relatively stable  on  a  trade-weighted  basis.   This  has  kept imported  inflation  at  bay.\r\n\r\nSecond,  domestic inflationary pressures are low as a result  of\r\n\r\nslower  economic activity, weaker consumer sentiments and keener\r\n\r\nretail  competition.   Third, commodity  prices  like  oil  have\r\n\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nOur  standard  of  living has not deteriorated.   Nominal  wages\r\n\r\nincreased  by  4.8%  in  the first quarter  of  1998.   With  an\r\n\r\ninflation rate of 1.1%, real wages have risen by 3.7%, the  same\r\n\r\nas in 1997.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ASEAN PLUS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Details)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng</b> asked the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nwhether he will elaborate on the details of the mechanism in the\r\n\r\nproposed early financial warning system, the ASEAN Plus.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the need for a\r\n\r\nregional  surveillance  mechanism within  ASEAN  was  recognised\r\n\r\nduring  the First ASEAN Finance Ministers' Meeting in Phuket  in\r\n\r\nMarch 1997 before the outbreak of the regional financial crisis.\r\n\r\nThe  onset of the regional financial crisis gave impetus to this\r\n\r\ninitiative.   In November 1997, ASEAN central banks  established\r\n\r\nthe  ASEAN  Central Bank Forum (ACBF), and this was followed  by\r\n\r\nthe  formation  of the Select Committee of Finance  and  Central\r\n\r\nBank Officials called the ASEAN Select Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ACBF carries out regional surveillance with the\r\n\r\ntechnical  support  of  the  IMF  and  complements  the   global\r\n\r\nsurveillance  work  of the IMF. It aims at evaluating  potential\r\n\r\neconomic  and  financial risks of member countries, highlighting\r\n\r\npolicy options and implications, and encouraging early action to\r\n\r\nminimise  such  risks.  The ACBF recently concluded  its  second\r\n\r\nmeeting in Jakarta on 8th-9th May 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Early Financial Warning System mentioned in press\r\n\r\nreports  refers  to  a proposal to establish an  ASEAN  Economic\r\n\r\nMonitoring   Mechanism  (AEMM)  to  support   the   surveillance\r\n\r\ninitiative.  ASEAN Finance Ministers agreed during their  second\r\n\r\nmeeting  in Jakarta in February this year to a proposal  by  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines  that  the  ADB be asked to  provide  technical  and\r\n\r\nsecretariat  support  for the surveillance  process  during  the\r\n\r\nfirst  two  years,  with a view to the ASEAN Secretariat  taking\r\n\r\nover thereafter.  The ADB and the ASEAN Secretariat had proposed\r\n\r\nto  establish the AEMM during the ADB Meeting in Geneva in April\r\n\r\nthis  year.   However, at that meeting, ASEAN Finance  Ministers\r\n\r\nhave agreed that the proposal requires further careful study.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that arrangements for the establishment\r\n\r\nof  the  surveillance  mechanism are primarily  focused  on  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  of ASEAN's needs, contrary to the impression  given  in\r\n\r\nnewspapers (and quoted in the above question), about it being an\r\n\r\n\"ASEAN plus\".  ASEAN Finance Ministers have, however, agreed  to\r\n\r\nmeet  with the Japanese Finance Minister on a regular  basis  to\r\n\r\nexchange  views.  The first such meeting was held at the  fringe\r\n\r\nof  the  ADB Meeting in Geneva this year.  Japan's Vice-Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance, Dr Eisuke Sakakibara, who represented his Minister\r\n\r\nat  the Meeting, had dubbed this meeting \"ASEAN Plus\", and  that\r\n\r\nis how it originated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, on \"ASEAN Plus\", is the\r\n\r\nfinancial  system in the ASEAN countries transparent  enough  to\r\n\r\nmake \"ASEAN Plus\" effective?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The whole idea of this ASEAN\r\n\r\nsurveillance  mechanism  is,  in fact,  to  produce  a  list  of\r\n\r\nstatistical data which participating member countries  would  be\r\n\r\nprepared to divulge.

In addition to Police and Singapore Immigration\r\n\r\nand  Registration  continuing rigorous  enforcement  action,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  amending  the  Immigration  Act  to  enhance   its\r\n\r\ndeterrent effect of the law against immigration offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Team has taken several measures to spread the\r\n\r\nmessage  to potential IIs that Singapore is serious in  tackling\r\n\r\nthe  illegal immigration problem, and that the penalties in  our\r\n\r\nlaws  are  severe.  Since early April 1998, SIR started  handing\r\n\r\nout  notices in the form of flyers to all immigration  offenders\r\n\r\nwho were repatriated after they have served their sentences,  so\r\n\r\nthat   they  can  send  the  message  to  potential  immigration\r\n\r\noffenders  back  home.   The  notice  carries  messages  on  the\r\n\r\nseriousness  of illegal entry and the penalties associated  with\r\n\r\nit, and are translated into the four official languages, as well\r\n\r\nas  in  Thai, Myanmar and Bangladeshi languages.  SIR  has  also\r\n\r\nstarted  screening  a  video clip on IIs at  Tanah  Merah  Ferry\r\n\r\nTerminal,  World  Trade Centre and on board  ferry  boats.   The\r\n\r\nvideo  clip  shows how the Home Team agencies  have  stepped  up\r\n\r\ntheir enforcement efforts to curb the II problem, eg. stepped up\r\n\r\naction  by PCG, police raids at construction sites, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nThe  message  that we convey is that anyone who tries  to  enter\r\n\r\nSingapore illegally will be arrested, punished and deported.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about crime rates and IIs? The number of IIs arrested\r\n\r\nfor  crimes  in 1997 averaged 13 per month.  For the first  four\r\n\r\nmonths of this year, the average figure was 23.  Although  there\r\n\r\nis  an increase, the absolute number is negligible compared with\r\n\r\nthe overall crime picture from January to April 1998 where there\r\n\r\nwas  a  monthly average of 1,468 arrested for various  offences.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is no cause for alarm for the present.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I told Dr Yaacob Ibrahim at the last Parliament sitting,\r\n\r\nthe  crime situation presently is under control.  The fact  that\r\n\r\nmore illegal immigrants are arrested does not so far indicate  a\r\n\r\ndeterioration  in  the  security  situation  in  Singapore.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  will continue to monitor the situation and take  steps\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the law and order situation continues to  remain\r\n\r\nunder control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MEASURES TO PROTECT PEOPLE AT BUS STOPS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications what\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmeasures to protect people at bus stops from being hit by  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  are  being implemented islandwide  and  whether  these\r\n\r\nmeasures are effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONSTRUCTION OF BARRIERS AT BUS STANDS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications  whether  he  will construct  barriers  or  other\r\n\r\ndevices at bus stands to protect commuters waiting for buses  at\r\n\r\nsuch stands.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Phun) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Sir, can I take\r\n\r\nQuestions 22 and 23 together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Road safety at bus stops depends\r\n\r\non  both design and driver behaviour. Our bus stops are designed\r\n\r\nto  international  standards.  Like  pedestrian  footpaths,  bus\r\n\r\nstops  are segregated from the road carriageway by raised kerbs.\r\n\r\nWhere  space  permits, we provide a bus bay  so  that  commuters\r\n\r\nwaiting at the bus stop are even further away from the road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A \"yellow band\" is drawn along the kerb at the bus stop as\r\n\r\na  visual  guide to commuters to stay away from the  kerb,  much\r\n\r\nlike  that  on  MRT  station platforms.  This  yellow  band  has\r\n\r\nalready been painted at more than half of the 4,200 bus stops in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The rest should be completed in a few months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At certain bus bays along very busy roads, markers have\r\n\r\nbeen  erected on the kerb before the approach to the bay.  These\r\n\r\nare  designed to guide bus drivers to stay clear of the bus stop\r\n\r\nwhen they pull into the bay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are suggestions that barriers be set up at the bus\r\n\r\nstops. These have been previously tried out.  Our experience  is\r\n\r\nthat  these  barriers  impede  passenger  flow  and  result   in\r\n\r\ncommuters moving into the bus bay or road itself.  Worse  still,\r\n\r\ncommuters may find themselves sandwiched between incoming  buses\r\n\r\nand the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbarriers,  especially when there is a rush.  In such  instances,\r\n\r\nbarriers can become an obstacle and a danger.  On balance, it is\r\n\r\nnot advisable to install barriers at bus stops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continuously look out for new ideas to enhance the\r\n\r\nsafety of our bus stops but, ultimately, it is the behaviour  of\r\n\r\ndrivers  and road users that determines safety along  the  roads\r\n\r\nand  the bus stops.  All drivers bear a great responsibility  in\r\n\r\nensuring  safety  when  they drive.   They  should  pay  careful\r\n\r\nattention  in  the  way they handle their vehicles  and  keep  a\r\n\r\nproper look out for pedestrians.  To further emphasise and clamp\r\n\r\ndown  on  those  drivers  with  careless  and  dangerous  driver\r\n\r\nbehaviour,  the  Traffic  Police has introduced  regulations  to\r\n\r\nsuspend  extreme speedsters and penalise those using  handphones\r\n\r\nwithout  hands-free car kits.  The success of these moves  would\r\n\r\nenhance road safety for all pedestrians.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, is it not possible\r\n\r\nfor the Government to find a way to build barriers in which they\r\n\r\nwill not impede the flow of passengers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, if you build the barrier in\r\n\r\nfront  of  the  bus stop, what happens is that, especially  when\r\n\r\nthere  is  a crowd, the passengers will tend to flow on  to  the\r\n\r\nroad.   So  that itself will create a danger and  it  will  also\r\n\r\nimpede the flow because they will not be able to get to the  bus\r\n\r\nfast enough and that would not be acceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, two supplementary\r\n\r\nquestions.   As mentioned by the Minister, where space  permits,\r\n\r\nbus  bays  will  be  incorporated.  But the recent  accident  at\r\n\r\nBendemeer  Road, which is a major trunk road, the bus stop  does\r\n\r\nnot  have  a bus bay.  Is there any guideline on where we  would\r\n\r\nhave  bus  bays? Given the fact that Bendemeer Road is  a  major\r\n\r\ntrunk road, I think a bus bay would be very useful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that in previous years, to the best\r\n\r\nof my recollection, because of accidents by buses, bollards have\r\n\r\nbeen  raised  at  certain bus stops, some  of  which  are  along\r\n\r\nClementi Road in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfront  of  the university.

So that is the criterion.  If  we\r\n\r\nhave,  we  will  do  it, especially along busy  roads.   As  for\r\n\r\nbollards,  they  are  also  barriers in  a  certain  sense  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, they create a danger.  We have to be mindful that  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  introduce  something which will  create  other  dangers\r\n\r\nbecause  if commuters were to stand in front of the bollards  or\r\n\r\nsitting on the bollards, when the buses come and if they are too\r\n\r\nclose,  there will also be a danger.  So we are mindful that  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  create other dangers just because we want  to  have\r\n\r\nthese barriers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

In  fact,\r\n\r\nif  you look at the features of our bus stops, I would say  that\r\n\r\nthe  features  that  I  mentioned earlier are  more  than  those\r\n\r\nimplemented  by other countries.

Police  takes\r\n\r\nstrict  enforcement action against motorists  who  endanger  the\r\n\r\nlives of other road-users by driving dangerously or recklessly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, the Road Traffic Act was amended to enhance the\r\n\r\npenalties  for dangerous driving.  We tripled the  maximum  fine\r\n\r\nand  doubled the maximum jail sentence for this offence.  Hence,\r\n\r\nanyone who drives a motor vehicle dangerously or recklessly  can\r\n\r\nnow  be fined up to $3,000 (up from $1,000) or jailed up to  one\r\n\r\nyear (up from six months), or both.  The penalties for a second-time  offender are more severe.   He can be fined up  to  $5,000\r\n\r\n(up  from $2,000) or jailed up to two years (up from one  year),\r\n\r\nor both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, anyone who causes the death of another person by\r\n\r\ndangerous  or  reckless driving will be jailed for  up  to  five\r\n\r\nyears when convicted.  Imprisonment is mandatory.  Regardless of\r\n\r\nwhether  he  has any previous conviction for dangerous  driving,\r\n\r\nthe  Court  has  the  power to ban him from  driving  for  life,\r\n\r\ndepending on the severity of the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A motorist who has at least two previous convictions for\r\n\r\ndangerous or reckless driving can be punished up to three  times\r\n\r\nthe penalty that he would otherwise have received, subject to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum jail term of 10 years if a jail term is imposed.   If he\r\n\r\nhad  caused  serious  injury or death when he  is  convicted  of\r\n\r\ndangerous  or reckless driving for the third time or  more,  the\r\n\r\nCourt may also impose caning of up to six strokes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Road Traffic Act was also amended in 1996 to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  any person who is convicted of dangerous driving, but  has\r\n\r\ntwo previous convictions of driving under the influence of drink\r\n\r\nor drugs or failing to give blood or breath specimen, or driving\r\n\r\nwhile  under suspension or disqualification, is liable  for  the\r\n\r\nsame  enhanced  penalty  as one who is  convicted  of  dangerous\r\n\r\ndriving for the third time or more.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more recently, the Road Traffic Rules were amended to\r\n\r\nfurther  deter  dangerous driving.

Further amendments to the MDA are now  necessary\r\n\r\nso  that we can continue to effectively curb drug abuse and drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>\"Ice\" and \"Ecstasy\"</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, psychotropic drugs are increasingly emerging as a\r\n\r\nmajor global threat. The UN International Drug Control Programme\r\n\r\nhas  reported that synthetic and psychotropic drugs  will  be  a\r\n\r\nproblem  of  global  concern in the 21st  century.  Psychotropic\r\n\r\ndrugs  are  synthetic substances made entirely  from  chemicals.\r\n\r\nThey  act  on  the central nervous system and have mind-altering\r\n\r\neffects   which   can   have  stimulating,   tranquillising   or\r\n\r\nhallucinating  effects.   Besides inducing  adverse  changes  in\r\n\r\nbehaviour,  these drugs can also have extremely harmful  effects\r\n\r\non the body.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Ice\" and \"Ecstasy\" are examples of psychotropic drugs.\r\n\r\nThese  drugs  are  easy to produce and can be manufactured  from\r\n\r\neasily  obtainable  chemicals and  raw  materials  in  makeshift\r\n\r\nlaboratories.   I  am  told  that \"Ice\",  for  example,  can  be\r\n\r\nproduced   using  ephedrine,  several  washtubs  and  a   stove.\r\n\r\n\"Ecstasy\" causes hallucinations, anxiety and can cause death  by\r\n\r\noverheating  of  the body or dehydration.  \"Ice\"  is  even  more\r\n\r\nharmful  and  lethal.  It is known to cause severe  convulsions,\r\n\r\nhallucinations, liver and kidney damage, cardiac damage,  stroke\r\n\r\nand  death.   \"Ice\" abusers are also prone to violent  behaviour\r\n\r\nafter  abusing  it.   Although  not  yet  rampantly  abused   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  \"Ice\"  currently poses a major  threat  due  to  its\r\n\r\nwidespread and growing popularity in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, no \"Ecstasy\" abuser was arrested in 1995.\r\n\r\nBut  in 1996, 661 were arrested.  The number fell to 403 in 1997\r\n\r\nafter  intensive  CNB enforcement.  In 1995, no   \"Ecstasy\"  was\r\n\r\nseized.   But in 1996, almost 39,000 were seized, and  in  1997,\r\n\r\nalmost 55,000 \"Ecstasy\" pills were seized.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No \"Ice\" abuser was arrested in 1995 also. But 5 were\r\n\r\narrested  in  1996  and  82 in 1997.  There  has  also  been  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  \"Ice\" trafficking activities  in  Singapore.    In\r\n\r\n1995,  12.3  grammes were seized and in 1996, 0.69 grammes  were\r\n\r\nseized.   But in 1997,  90.3 grammes were seized.   But  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  four  months of this year, we have already seized   about\r\n\r\n560 grammes of \"Ice\", due to the success of major CNB operations\r\n\r\nlike Operation Phantom.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhanced Penalties for \"Ice\" and \"Ecstasy\" Traffickers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the \"Ecstasy\" abuse situation today is under\r\n\r\ncontrol, we must act decisively to ensure that it does not  gain\r\n\r\na   foothold   in   Singapore.   Stricter  legislation   against\r\n\r\ntraffickers of \"Ecstasy\" and \"Ice\" will also deter international\r\n\r\nsyndicates  from  using  Singapore as a transhipment  point  for\r\n\r\nthese drugs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry proposes that the Act be amended to facilitate\r\n\r\nthe prosecution of \"Ice\" and \"Ecstasy\" traffickers.  Clause 7 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill amends section 17 of the Act to extend the presumption\r\n\r\nclause for trafficking to include \"Ice\" and \"Ecstasy\".  A person\r\n\r\ncaught  in  possession of more than 25 grammes of  \"Ice\"  or  10\r\n\r\ngrammes  of  \"Ecstasy\"  is presumed to be trafficking  in  these\r\n\r\ndrugs and would be charged with the offence of trafficking  Thus\r\n\r\nthe  burden of proof against trafficking would rightly be placed\r\n\r\non  the offender.  These amounts, ie, 25 grammes of \"Ice\" and 10\r\n\r\ngrammes  of  \"Ecstasy\"  are  equivalent  to  100  doses  of  the\r\n\r\nestimated  daily consumption of these drugs.  This is  the  same\r\n\r\nbasis for deriving the presumption amounts for other drugs  such\r\n\r\nas heroin, opium, morphine and cocaine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, clauses 21(a) to (c) of the Bill amend the\r\n\r\nSecond  Schedule of the MDA to make the death penalty  mandatory\r\n\r\nfor anyone who is convicted of trafficking,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmanufacturing, importing or exporting more than 250  grammes  of\r\n\r\n\"Ice\".  This  amount is equivalent to 1,000 doses of  the  daily\r\n\r\nestimated  consumption of the drug. This is also the  basis  for\r\n\r\nderiving the amount attracting capital punishment for the  other\r\n\r\ndrugs  which  I  mentioned.   Unlike \"Ice\"  which  is  extremely\r\n\r\ndangerous,  \"Ecstasy\" is less potent and dangerous.  Hence,  MHA\r\n\r\nis  not  proposing at this stage to introduce the death  penalty\r\n\r\nfor \"Ecstasy\"-related offences.  Nevertheless, the penalties are\r\n\r\nstill  heavy  as  \"Ecstasy\" is a Class  A  drug.   For  example,\r\n\r\ntrafficking in \"Ecstasy\" currently attracts a maximum penalty of\r\n\r\n20 years' imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, and a minimum\r\n\r\npenalty of 5 years' imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Hardcore Addicts</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the next set of amendments, which are\r\n\r\nrelated  to  the proposed long-term imprisonment and caning  for\r\n\r\nhardcore drug addicts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the overall drug situation in Singapore has\r\n\r\nimproved, the problem of a large number of hardcore addicts  who\r\n\r\nrepeatedly relapse still remains. A hardcore addict is  one  who\r\n\r\nhas  been admitted to DRC or Prison for a drug offence for  more\r\n\r\nthan  two  times.  In fact, the proportion of  hardcore  addicts\r\n\r\namong our total DRC population has increased from 65% in 1994 to\r\n\r\n71% in 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that these hardcore drug addicts are not treated\r\n\r\nas  victims.   They  are  bad people.  Firstly,  to  feed  their\r\n\r\nexpensive habit, many of them turn to crime.  More than  73%  of\r\n\r\nhardcore  drug addicts have some form of criminal record,  while\r\n\r\nabout  76%  of  all addicts with criminal records  are  hardcore\r\n\r\naddicts.  So, they are criminals also.  Secondly, these hardcore\r\n\r\naddicts  contaminate the innocent and lead  them  to  experiment\r\n\r\nwith,  and  consume  drugs, thus perpetuating  a  drug  culture.\r\n\r\nEvery  addict,  especially a hardcore  addict,  is  a  potential\r\n\r\npusher  and  trafficker.  These hardcore  addicts  also  inflict\r\n\r\nuntold  misery on their families and are a financial  burden  to\r\n\r\ntheir  family members.  They are bad role models, especially  if\r\n\r\nthey are fathers or mothers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Long Term Imprisonment and Caning for Hardcore Addicts</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the Act is amended to provide for long-term\r\n\r\nimprisonment  and caning for hardcore addicts.   This  serves  a\r\n\r\nnumber of objectives.  Firstly, by putting these addicts out  of\r\n\r\ncirculation for a long time, it will help to protect the  public\r\n\r\nfrom  them, especially as the majority of these addicts turn  to\r\n\r\ncrime  to  feed  their habit.    Secondly, it is also  aimed  at\r\n\r\ndeterring  drug addicts from persisting in their drug  addiction\r\n\r\nby  making the consequences of continued addiction very  severe.\r\n\r\nIn  the  long run, the long-term imprisonment and caning  should\r\n\r\nhelp  to  reduce  the  relapse rate of drug  addicts  and  deter\r\n\r\npotential drug abusers from falling into the drug trap. Thirdly,\r\n\r\nit  is to punish these recalcitrant addicts for persisting  with\r\n\r\ntheir  drug  habit. Public reaction to my announcement  that  we\r\n\r\nwould   enhance  punishment  for  hardcore  addicts,  has   been\r\n\r\npositive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 of the Bill will introduce a new section 33A in the\r\n\r\nMDA  to  provide for this new regime. Upon conviction in  Court,\r\n\r\nhardcore addicts would be given a mandatory imprisonment term of\r\n\r\nbetween  five and seven years and between three and six  strokes\r\n\r\nof the cane under the first  tier penalty. Under the second tier\r\n\r\npenalty,  any addict who has been punished under the first  tier\r\n\r\npenalty and who is arrested again for a drug consumption offence\r\n\r\nwill,  upon  conviction, be punished with a longer  imprisonment\r\n\r\nterm of between 7 and 13 years, and between 6 and 12 strokes  of\r\n\r\nthe  cane.  For the purpose of prosecuting an addict under  this\r\n\r\nnew  section,  the Government will only rely on  DRC  admissions\r\n\r\nand drug conviction records on or after 1st October 1992.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current intention is to only target the long-term\r\n\r\nimprisonment  regime and caning at hardcore  abusers  of  opiate\r\n\r\ndrugs, ie, heroin, opium and morphine.    This is because  among\r\n\r\nthe  various  drugs  of abuse, opiate drugs have  the  strongest\r\n\r\nphysical  and  psychological hold over their  users.    Besides,\r\n\r\nthese are the main drugs\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabused  in Singapore, with more than 75% of all addicts arrested\r\n\r\neach  year  since  1994  abusing  these  drugs.    However,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will carefully monitor the situation  and  will  not\r\n\r\nhesitate to impose similar measures against hardcore addicts  of\r\n\r\nother drugs, such as \"Ice\", should the situation warrant it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A related amendment is to enhance the penalty for failing to\r\n\r\nprovide  urine  specimen under section 31(2)  to  that  of  drug\r\n\r\nconsumption.   The former offence, ie, failure to provide  urine\r\n\r\nsample,   refers to instances where arrested addicts  refuse  to\r\n\r\nprovide  urine  samples for testing purposes without  reasonable\r\n\r\nexcuse  when  asked  to  do so.   This amendment  is  necessary.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, suspected drug addicts would rather refuse to provide\r\n\r\na  urine specimen and be only liable for a lesser penalty  of  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  $5000 fine under section 31(2), than be liable for  the\r\n\r\nharsher penalties of drug consumption.  Clause 21(f) would amend\r\n\r\nthe  Second  Schedule of the Act to equate the penalty  for  the\r\n\r\noffence  of  failing to provide urine specimen with the  penalty\r\n\r\nfor drug consumption. For the same reason, clause 14 would amend\r\n\r\nsection  33(3)  to  include a previous offence  for  failing  to\r\n\r\nprovide  urine  sample  as a previous drug  antecedent  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of sentencing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the new regime of long-term imprisonment and caning will\r\n\r\napply  to  addicts who are caught for the consumption of  opiate\r\n\r\ndrugs  or  fail  to  provide  urine sample,  and  have,  let  me\r\n\r\nelaborate:\r\n\r\n(a) at least two previous DRC admissions for opiate abuse; or\r\n\r\n(b) at least two previous convictions for opiate abuse; or\r\n\r\n(c)  at least two previous convictions for failure to provide  a\r\n\r\nurine specimen; or\r\n\r\n(d)  one previous DRC admission and one previous conviction  for\r\n\r\nopiate abuse; or\r\n\r\n(e)  one previous DRC admission and one previous conviction  for\r\n\r\nfailure to provide urine sample; or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n(f)  one  previous conviction for opiate abuse and one  previous\r\n\r\nconviction for failure to provide urine specimen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A previous conviction by a subordinate military court for the\r\n\r\nopiate  abuse  will also be considered as a previous  conviction\r\n\r\nfor purposes of sentencing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction over Offence of Drug Consumption</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to turn to the issue of consumption of controlled\r\n\r\ndrugs  outside  Singapore.    Currently,  only  consumption   of\r\n\r\ncontrolled drugs within Singapore is punishable under  the  MDA.\r\n\r\nThe  Central Narcotics Bureau cannot charge persons  who  abused\r\n\r\ndrugs  overseas, say, in Malaysia, Batam, Bintan or Karimun,  or\r\n\r\nanywhere  else, and tested positive for drugs upon their  return\r\n\r\nat our immigration entry points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a noticeable trend of Singaporeans consuming\r\n\r\ndrugs  overseas  in recent years. In 1994, 1,402 persons  tested\r\n\r\npositive for drug consumption at our checkpoints.  In 1997,  the\r\n\r\nfigure was 1,768 persons or a 26% increase over the 1994 figure.\r\n\r\nWith  more Singaporeans travelling overseas, the easy access  of\r\n\r\ndrugs  nearby in neighbouring countries and the proposed harsher\r\n\r\npenalties  for  hardcore addicts, it is  prudent  to  plug  this\r\n\r\nloophole.    Otherwise, local addicts would  intentionally  make\r\n\r\ntrips  out  of Singapore to neighbouring countries to get  their\r\n\r\nfixes to avoid arrest and prosecution in Singapore, and to  make\r\n\r\na  mockery  of  our drug laws.   Clause 5 of the Amendment  Bill\r\n\r\nwould  create  a  new section 8A to confer  on  our  Courts  the\r\n\r\njurisdiction to try the offence of drug consumption overseas  by\r\n\r\na  Singaporean citizen or Permanent Resident whose urine  sample\r\n\r\nwas  found positive in Singapore and to deal with them as though\r\n\r\nthe act of consumption was committed  in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>1988  UN  Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotics  Drugs and Psychotropic Substances</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have taken firm and incisive actions against drug\r\n\r\nabuse  and  trafficking  domestically, we  remain  committed  to\r\n\r\ninternational efforts to stamp out the drug\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproblem.     This is because drugs and the proceeds  from  drug-related activities are global problems that respect no borders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Singapore is committed to tackling\r\n\r\ninternational   drug  trafficking,  importing,   exporting   and\r\n\r\nmanufacturing.     It  has acceded to the three  United  Nations\r\n\r\ndrug  abuse  conventions: namely, the 1961 Single Convention  on\r\n\r\nNarcotic  Drugs, the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances,\r\n\r\nand,  late last year, the 1988 United Nations Convention Against\r\n\r\nIllicit Traffic In Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1988 UN Convention, or the Vienna Convention, as it is\r\n\r\ncommonly known, is an international co-ordinated effort to  make\r\n\r\nit   mandatory   for  signatory  states  to  criminalise   drug-trafficking   and   its  related  activities,  including   money\r\n\r\nlaundering  and the use of precursor chemicals in  manufacturing\r\n\r\ncontrolled  drugs.    We only formally acceded  to  it  on  21st\r\n\r\nOctober  1997 because we wanted to first put in place the  legal\r\n\r\nframework,  which  is  necessary if we are  to  fully  meet  our\r\n\r\nobligations as a signatory state to the Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 and 21 of the Bill would amend the MDA to allow\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  give effect to its obligations under  the  Vienna\r\n\r\nConvention.      For   example,   we   would   criminalise   the\r\n\r\nmanufacture, possession and distribution of precursor chemicals,\r\n\r\ncontrolled  materials and equipment intended for the manufacture\r\n\r\nof  controlled  drugs.  The penalties would be a maximum  of  20\r\n\r\nyears' imprisonment or $200,000 fine or both.  A new section 18B\r\n\r\nof  the  MDA would empower the Minister to make regulations  for\r\n\r\nvarious  matters relating to the control of precursor chemicals,\r\n\r\nand controlled materials and equipment, such as the licensing of\r\n\r\ntheir  import  and  export, and documentation  requirements  for\r\n\r\ntheir  transhipment.   A related amendment is  clause  23  which\r\n\r\namends  the  First Schedule of the Extradition  Act  to  include\r\n\r\noffences   relating  to  psychotropic  substances  and  offences\r\n\r\nrelating   to   benefits  derived  from  drug   trafficking   as\r\n\r\nextraditable  offences.    The latter is one of the  obligations\r\n\r\nof signatory states under the Vienna Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Amendment Bill also proposes various amendments\r\n\r\nthat  are essential to facilitate drug enforcement and to  allow\r\n\r\nthe  Prisons  Department  and the Central  Narcotics  Bureau  to\r\n\r\noperate more effectively.  For example, clauses 8, 9, 13 and  18\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill  would strengthen the enforcement  powers  of  CNB\r\n\r\nofficers  in  relation to investigation, search  and  arrest  of\r\n\r\noffenders under the MDA and its Regulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill would provide for the mandatory forfeiture\r\n\r\nof  any vehicle used in connection with an MDA offence.     This\r\n\r\nis  in  line  with  similar provisions  for  the  forfeiture  of\r\n\r\nvehicles in other legislation such as the Road Traffic  Act  and\r\n\r\nthe Immigration Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may also recall last year's ruling by the Court of\r\n\r\nAppeal that \"life imprisonment\" should be equated to the natural\r\n\r\nlife  of a prisoner, rather than 20 years, as practised  by  the\r\n\r\nPrisons.    Currently,  some  MDA  offences  attract  a  maximum\r\n\r\nimprisonment term of 30 years and 15 strokes of the cane.     To\r\n\r\nuphold  the  original policy intention that  the  penalties  for\r\n\r\nthese  offences  should be more severe than  life  imprisonment,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  then  taken to be 20 years, clause 20  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides for \"imprisonment for life\" as an additional sentencing\r\n\r\noption for these offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, the proposed amendments would allow my\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  respond  effectively  to  the  ever-changing  drug\r\n\r\nsituation  and to sufficiently deter drug abuse and  other  drug\r\n\r\nrelated  offences.    The overall drug situation  may  be  under\r\n\r\ncontrol today, but we must never rest on our laurels.   However,\r\n\r\nin  addition  to tough laws and strict enforcement,  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nassure  Members  that  my Ministry would continue  to  focus  on\r\n\r\npreventive   drug   education,  treatment,  rehabilitation   and\r\n\r\naftercare  of  recovering addicts who are  amenable  to  change.\r\n\r\nOnly by adopting a comprehensive approach towards drugs would we\r\n\r\neradicate the drug problem in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the overall drug situation in Singapore remains under\r\n\r\ncontrol,  in  fact,  since April last year,  there  has  been  a\r\n\r\ndecrease in the number of drug addicts being detected.  However,\r\n\r\nas the Minister said, the percentage of hardcore addicts remains\r\n\r\nhigh,  and this problem has to be addressed urgently,  as  these\r\n\r\naddicts  not  only become a menace to the society,  and  causing\r\n\r\nuntold  anguish  to  the family, but very  often  they  turn  to\r\n\r\ncriminal activities in order to support their habit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also recognised that early conversion of these addicts has\r\n\r\na  higher  rate of success in helping them live a  normal  life.\r\n\r\nThe  longer  these addicts get into the habit,  the  chances  of\r\n\r\nrecovery   would   decrease   dramatically.    Therefore,    the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  section 33A(1) and (2) on the  enhancement  of\r\n\r\npunishment for this category of third and fourth time  offenders\r\n\r\nis timely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since notice was given two years ago, I understand that\r\n\r\nthere  has been a drop in the number of third timers. The reason\r\n\r\nis  that  the second timers know that if they persist  in  their\r\n\r\ndrug  taking,  they will be faced with a much harsher  and  more\r\n\r\nsevere punishment.  Therefore, it is necessary to carry out this\r\n\r\nsevere punishment as much resources are being committed to  help\r\n\r\nthe first and second timers to rehabilitate themselves.  And  to\r\n\r\nthose who refuse to be helped, the law should come down on  them\r\n\r\nhard.   But  I  would like to urge the Minister to  continue  to\r\n\r\nspare  no effort in the rehabilitation of this group of  addicts\r\n\r\nso  that  more of those who are unfortunate enough to be exposed\r\n\r\nto  this  deadly habit would have the chance of living a  normal\r\n\r\nlife.  Because we have to face the fact that those who have been\r\n\r\ncaught  taking  drugs the third or fourth time would  have  very\r\n\r\nlittle chance to be cured even when they are confronted with the\r\n\r\nmost severe punishment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe I have not come across many anti-drug campaigns being carried out recently. Anti-smoking and\r\n\r\nanti-crime campaigns seem to be taking the limelight.   I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  suggest that the Ministry carry on with  more  active\r\n\r\npublic education on the awareness of the harmful consequence  of\r\n\r\ndrug abuse.  Although the introduction of more severe punishment\r\n\r\nof  repeated  drug addicts is a step in the right  direction  to\r\n\r\ndeter  hard-core addicts from further indulgence in this  habit,\r\n\r\nthe  most effective way to combat this social ill will still  be\r\n\r\ndeterring  the would-be drug addict from following this  vicious\r\n\r\ncycle.  After all, prevention is always better than cure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister wants this House to\r\n\r\napprove laws which will allow the Government to inflict corporal\r\n\r\npunishment on repeated consumers of specified drugs.   A  second\r\n\r\ntime offender under the new section 33A can now be caned up to a\r\n\r\nmaximum of 12 strokes.  This makes repeat consuming of specified\r\n\r\ndrugs  an  offence  equivalent to the most heinous  and  violent\r\n\r\ncrimes.   Caning  is  normally reserved  for  those  who  commit\r\n\r\nheinous  and  violent  crimes,  like  armed  robbery,  rape   or\r\n\r\ntrafficking in heroin and other illegal drugs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in some countries, consumption of heroin is not even a\r\n\r\ncrime.   It  is classified a social problem.  But in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nconsumption of heroin is considered a crime.  Those  who  do  so\r\n\r\ncan be compulsorily detained for treatment and rehabilitated  up\r\n\r\nto  a  maximum  period  of  three  years.   The  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has to escalate the punishment from non-corporal  to\r\n\r\ncorporal   ones  for  repeat  drug  offenders  shows  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  treatment and rehabilitation programmes  for  drug\r\n\r\naddicts   over  the  last  20  years  have  probably  not   been\r\n\r\nsuccessful.   It  is  now resorting to strong-arm  tactics.   It\r\n\r\nvirtually  wants  to impose its will on the  drug  addicts.   It\r\n\r\ntells  the  drug addicts: Do not take heroin or other  specified\r\n\r\ndrugs  again!  If you do so, we are going to whack the  daylight\r\n\r\nout of you!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, the majority of drug addicts will get the message and\r\n\r\nstop their old habits of taking drugs.  But what happens\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nif  a drug addict who is so badly addicted and he is a person of\r\n\r\nweak  character and is unable to give up the heroin habit,  even\r\n\r\nafter the second conviction and punishment under the new section\r\n\r\n33A?   There  is  no  mention in the Bill of further  punishment\r\n\r\nafter  that.   Does  it mean that this type of  recidivist  drug\r\n\r\naddict  has to be locked up forever?   Perhaps the Minister  can\r\n\r\nclarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also like the Minister perhaps to tell this House why\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  treatment and rehabilitation  programmes  for\r\n\r\ndrug addicts have not been so successful.  Is the Government not\r\n\r\nputting enough money into the programmes?  If not, why not?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to have another look at\r\n\r\nthese  treatment and rehabilitation programmes of  drug  addicts\r\n\r\nrather than take the easy way out by caning repeat offenders  of\r\n\r\nspecified  drugs.   If  Singapore has to resort  to  caning  all\r\n\r\nsocial wrong-doers, then I am afraid that Singapore can never be\r\n\r\na cohesive society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I speak in support of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, there is something which I would like to bring to the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the  House.  When the Minister  was  speaking  on\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants  -  I thought I heard  him  wrongly,  but  I\r\n\r\nchecked - he said Bangladeshi language.  I do not think there is\r\n\r\na  Bangladeshi  language.   I hope the  Ministry  officials  who\r\n\r\nprepared  these  answers  be made aware  that  the  language  is\r\n\r\nBengali or Bangla.  So I do not want Hansard to have that again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I say that I disagree with the point made by Mr Chiam.\r\n\r\nI  think  the drug pusher is the worst form of criminal that  we\r\n\r\ncan come across.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Consumers, not pushers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Consumers and pushers are the same class of\r\n\r\npeople.   I will come to that later.  I will come to Mr  Chiam's\r\n\r\npoint later because I think we have come a long way, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  since  we  started  our efforts  to  curb  drug  abuse  in\r\n\r\nSingapore in the 70s.  Many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncritics  used to chide us for having such a stringent  law.   We\r\n\r\nimposed  the death penalty.  We introduced mandatory  sentences.\r\n\r\nEven  some  of  our own leaders thought that it was  too  harsh.\r\n\r\nSir,  we have come a long way.  But despite all the efforts,  we\r\n\r\nhave seen how drug abuse has increased not only in Singapore but\r\n\r\nall  over  the  world.   We have in our own  newspapers  graphic\r\n\r\ndetails of the suffering of these young men and women.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Minister and his officials have responded well\r\n\r\nby  bringing  up this legislation.  I shall not  deal  with  the\r\n\r\ndetails  of  the Bill as other Members are going to speak.   But\r\n\r\nsuffice  to  say,  Sir,  for the law  to  be  effective,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  -  and I repeat - it is important that the  community\r\n\r\nmust  play its role.  I urge every Singaporean to play his role.\r\n\r\nIf  we  have a member of the household or a friend who has  gone\r\n\r\nastray, we must try our level best to persuade him, soft-talk to\r\n\r\nhim, if need be, refer him for professional counselling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the course of my duty in SINDA, I have visited two to\r\n\r\nthree  rehabilitation centres.  I am really impressed  with  the\r\n\r\ndedication  with  which  these  volunteers  have  reformed   and\r\n\r\nrehabilitated  drug  addicts.   And  that  is  why  when  I  was\r\n\r\nlistening   to   my   friend,  Mr  Kenneth   Chen's   call   for\r\n\r\nrehabilitation,  I  thought this is an area that  not  just  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Home  Affairs  but  the  Ministry  of   Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment should work together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the drug abusers start with soft drugs, I think Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  was quite right.  I saw in a recent trip to India,  bhang\r\n\r\ntrees  growing like wild bush, and in Singapore if  you  consume\r\n\r\nbhang,  of  course, you are going to be in trouble, but  not  in\r\n\r\nIndia.   So  my  appeal is that we should try to persuade  these\r\n\r\nyoung people to give up their habit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from drugs, many of them move to crime which has very close\r\n\r\nco-relation.  If you have a profile or if you make  a  study  of\r\n\r\nthe  drug abusers, you will find most of them have some form  of\r\n\r\ncriminal  record.   It is therefore important that  our  schools\r\n\r\nshould play a more active role.  I would like\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  congratulate the Minister for Education, who also happens to\r\n\r\nhave  the  double role of Minister for Defence, for the valuable\r\n\r\nwork  that  his Ministry does in dealing with drug  abuse,  both\r\n\r\nwith  the regulars as well as the national servicemen.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe problem should be addressed, and here again I agree with  Mr\r\n\r\nChen that the campaign should start early.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our location makes it vulnerable to international drug\r\n\r\nsyndicates.   We  cannot run away from this fact.   Despite  the\r\n\r\ndeath penalty, people try their luck.  I would therefore like to\r\n\r\ncommend  our Home Team, the Police as well as the CNB.  In  this\r\n\r\nregard, I wonder if the CNB could become a specialised branch of\r\n\r\nthe  Police.   In  this  way,  we  will  transfer  some  of  the\r\n\r\noutstanding Police Officers to do some CNB duties.  The Minister\r\n\r\nmay want to study this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, though unrelated to this Bill, it is important that we must\r\n\r\nalso try to win the battle against another form of abuse, and  I\r\n\r\nam speaking of smoking.  It is very distressing to see our young\r\n\r\nsmoking.  Why do I say this, Sir?  Because for many cases,  from\r\n\r\nsmoking,  it goes to other things.  I am not saying all  smokers\r\n\r\nend  up  in  this.  But some early smokers start and end  up  in\r\n\r\nthis.  So if we can solve this problem, it will be good for  the\r\n\r\ncommunity,  because I see it is just not only in  Orchard  Road,\r\n\r\nbut  also  Shenton  Way,  young  ladies  puffing  their  way  in\r\n\r\ncoffeeshops.   So  I  would urge that we should  be  very,  very\r\n\r\ncareful that we should not leave this area unattended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the new definition of \"manufacture\". It now\r\n\r\ncovers  transformation of one drug into another.  And I think  a\r\n\r\nvaluable  area has been taken care of and the loophole has  been\r\n\r\ncovered.   Under the new section 8A, Sir, the law on consumption\r\n\r\nof  drugs  outside Singapore is to be welcomed.   It  is  extra-territorial.   But I think we have other legislation,  like  the\r\n\r\nWomen's Charter where bigamy is punished, whether it happens  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  or  outside.   So  I  think  Members  should  not  be\r\n\r\nsurprised at this legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, under section 17, new drugs will come under the\r\n\r\ncontrol of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  has given detailed history of  them.   I  do  not\r\n\r\npropose to go over them.  I end, Sir, with this thought for  the\r\n\r\nMembers.   A  murderer only kills one person at a time  while  a\r\n\r\ndrug  pusher kills many.  He brings about disaster to the family\r\n\r\nof  the drug addict, besides the drug abuser himself, and  which\r\n\r\nwe  have  no sympathy for him at all.  He is the worst  form  of\r\n\r\ncriminal.   We  should  show  our  total  abhorrence  for   this\r\n\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor giving me this opportunity to speak on a topic which I think\r\n\r\nall  of us as parents must give serious attention to because  it\r\n\r\ncan affect our teenage children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having just had the last Parliament debate on enhanced penalties\r\n\r\nfor  maid abuse, my first reaction to this Amendment Bill was  a\r\n\r\nhesitant  one  as I questioned why we are debating  yet  another\r\n\r\nharsh  Bill about longer jail sentences and more strokes of  the\r\n\r\ncane  for  drug  addiction.  Have we become a  society  able  to\r\n\r\nprevent  delinquent  behaviour only by corporal  punishment  and\r\n\r\nincarceration and not by non-coercive means?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consulted some officers from NCADA, SANA, SCORE as well as\r\n\r\nhalf-way  houses  like Taman Bacaan, New Direction  and  several\r\n\r\nfamily  service centres and volunteers dealing with drug addicts\r\n\r\nand I would like to share with this House my reflections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the recognition that this Bill is a tough love\r\n\r\npolicy.   Everyone  I  have talked to  supported  the  Bill,  in\r\n\r\nparticular  enhanced  penalties on Ice and Ecstasy  traffickers.\r\n\r\nIt  was  on  the  basis of balancing compassion  with  pragmatic\r\n\r\nefficacy  that  drug  prevention advocates, therapists  and  ex-addicts themselves came to accept long jail sentences and caning\r\n\r\nas  effective  deterrents  to  drug  offence.   There  was  some\r\n\r\nsympathy,  however, for those offenders who only hurt themselves\r\n\r\nand had no other criminal record.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caning is spared for the first two convictions. In some other\r\n\r\ncountries, a first offender is in fact whipped.  The general\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfeeling  is that there is ample warning to first-time offenders.\r\n\r\nIt  was pointed out to me by a drug prevention officer that,  in\r\n\r\nthe  past,  we  punished too little and too late.  This  lenient\r\n\r\napproach  led to the growth of addicts from 500 in the  70s  who\r\n\r\nwere  incarcerated  on  St. John's Island to  10,000  registered\r\n\r\ntoday, without counting those still in hiding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some officers who were talking to me even recommend longer\r\n\r\nincarceration to include a longer stay at half-way  houses  from\r\n\r\nthe  current  stipulation of six months to  18  months  so  that\r\n\r\ninmates undergo a more intensive individual and family treatment\r\n\r\nprogramme in a user friendly environment away from prison cells.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, they also learn work and social skills  which\r\n\r\nwill   enable   them  to  re-integrate  into  society.    Social\r\n\r\nintegration, Sir, and work are the best relapse control factors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am persuaded to support this Bill because I believe\r\n\r\nthat implementing a harsh Bill now will send a strong message to\r\n\r\nthose  who  are experimenting with drugs for the first  time  to\r\n\r\nquickly  seek help in order to avoid the pain of the  cane.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  there  are  in recent weeks more volunteer  walk-ins  for\r\n\r\ntreatment because they got to know of the enhanced penalties  in\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we accept that a harsh law cannot make the 20% of all\r\n\r\naddicts who are hardcore, turn around and be good again, it will\r\n\r\ndeter  the  80%  who are at the early stages of experimentation.\r\n\r\nMore  important, it will be a deterrent for those who have never\r\n\r\ntried drugs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my research, I was awakened to a reality of drug abuse\r\n\r\nfraught with tremendous pain and coping difficulty.  The  nature\r\n\r\nof  the drug addiction is such that we have to adopt this \"tough\r\n\r\nlove\"  policy  to tackle the illness square on.   A  tough  love\r\n\r\npolicy   includes   compassion  tempered   by   discipline   and\r\n\r\ndeterrents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second reflection though is the recognition of this Bill\r\n\r\nas a limited component in the overall drug prevention programme.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill  takes  care  of keeping offenders  safely  away  from\r\n\r\ncontaminating others, but what programmes are offered\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nduring   incarceration  and  after  release  to   enable   these\r\n\r\noffenders,  many  of  whom still young with families,  integrate\r\n\r\ninto mainstream society and lead independent lives?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise that the Home Affairs Ministry has taken the\r\n\r\nlead  to  reorganise the drug management sector by  coordinating\r\n\r\nprevention   and  rehabilitation  programmes  in   the   various\r\n\r\nMinistries,  detention centres and help  agencies.   The  recent\r\n\r\nnational  seminar on \"Alliance Against Drug Abuse - A  Community\r\n\r\nApproach\"  was  a  case in point.  I also read  reports  on  the\r\n\r\nadvances  in  the  management of drug addiction using  medicines\r\n\r\nlike  Naltrexone and Trexan for treatment and relapses  control;\r\n\r\n12-step  counselling method used to restore an addict's  control\r\n\r\nover  his  impulses as well as the setting up of the  Industrial\r\n\r\nServices  Cooperative Societies Ltd (ISCOS)  to  find  jobs  for\r\n\r\nthese addicts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are commendable programmes, Sir. I was told,\r\n\r\nhowever,  that the prison curriculum adopts very much an  inmate\r\n\r\nfocus  characterised  by  chemical correction,  physical  drill,\r\n\r\nconfinement  and  rough handling.  While this  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nstart  the  detoxification programme, the use  of  physical  and\r\n\r\npsychological  humiliation,  Sir,  cannot  restore  dignity  and\r\n\r\nsustain motivation towards recovery in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads me to the third reflection - a need to shift\r\n\r\nfocus from addressing the nature of drug addiction to the socio-psychological  context  of drug addicts and  their  families  to\r\n\r\nidentify  the  reasons  for the occurrence  of  drug  abuse  and\r\n\r\nrecurrent relapses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1995 Inter-Ministry Report on Dysfunctional Families,\r\n\r\nJuvenile  Delinquency and Drug Abuse cited dysfunctional  family\r\n\r\nconditions and relationships as the main cause.  The Report also\r\n\r\nsubmitted a list of recommendations in tackling drug abuse which\r\n\r\nI  hope  the various Ministries would act on.  During my contact\r\n\r\nwith  social workers during the last few weeks, I met and learnt\r\n\r\nabout\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmany  cases:  a  9  year old girl who grew up  in  a  delinquent\r\n\r\nculture  of broken homes and poor education; a  11 year old  boy\r\n\r\nwho was jailed because he stole  a car; a 16 year old boy who is\r\n\r\nheading  the household because both his parents are in the  drug\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  centre (DRC); several others who  were  released\r\n\r\nfrom  half-way houses but had no homes to return to because they\r\n\r\nwere  rejected by spouses and family members; a whole family  of\r\n\r\ndrug addiction because family members could not emerge from  the\r\n\r\nculture of delinquency and hopelessness and were driven to drugs\r\n\r\nfor psychological relief; young female addicts leaving babies in\r\n\r\nthe  care  of  relatives serving their jail  terms  while  their\r\n\r\nhusbands  are  also  serving theirs; and  many  more  recovering\r\n\r\naddicts who could no longer adjust to normal living because they\r\n\r\nhave  lost touch with friends and work environment due  to  long\r\n\r\nincarceration.   I  could  go on and  on  with  these  tales  of\r\n\r\ndisabling families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads me to my fourth reflection - a need to\r\n\r\nstrengthen family support rehabilitation programmes.  We read in\r\n\r\nthe  literature that the most successful addicts-on-recovery are\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  highly motivated, employed and  are  in  stable\r\n\r\nrelationships.  Among these, the family is a crucial  pillar  of\r\n\r\nsupport.  This is not the case in most of the families  of  drug\r\n\r\naddicts.   They lack this critical support, and with  time  they\r\n\r\nforget  the fear and the pain of caning and jail confinement  as\r\n\r\nwell.  Therefore, it is no surprise that recidivism is high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we bring the family into the rehabilitation\r\n\r\nprogrammes  during  and  after incarceration?   There  are  some\r\n\r\nsuggestions from the community.  The first is support  a  family\r\n\r\ntherapy  model  by  involving the family in  the  rehabilitation\r\n\r\nprogramme conducted in prisons.  Detention institutions, such as\r\n\r\nDRCs   and  SCORE,  conduct  a  pre-release  family  counselling\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Experts feel that this is too brief and too late  in\r\n\r\nthe detention.  Family counselling sessions should be instituted\r\n\r\nright from the start during incarceration to restore a sense  of\r\n\r\nownership  and  family  participation so that  when  the  addict\r\n\r\nreturns home, there is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nless  emotional adjustment.  In the long run, could the Ministry\r\n\r\nconsider  converting  some  old  HDB  blocks  to  rehabilitation\r\n\r\ncentres  whereby  families can stay together during  appropriate\r\n\r\ntreatment phases?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion is increased funding for half-way\r\n\r\ninstitutions  from  $16  per capita  to  $25  to  allow  weekend\r\n\r\naccommodation  of  children and family members  with  recovering\r\n\r\ninmates.  In Taman Bacaan half-way house for women drug abusers,\r\n\r\nfamily living together providing emotional support to recovering\r\n\r\naddicts  proved  to be most effective for recovery  and  relapse\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion is to make parents pay a small amount,\r\n\r\neven $1 a day or 50 cents a day, to half-way houses to restore a\r\n\r\nsense  of  responsibility towards the offenders and a  sense  of\r\n\r\nownership of a family problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth suggestion is to relax the electronic monitoring\r\n\r\nsystem by not stipulating that offenders under probation must be\r\n\r\nat  home  in  the  evenings, so that they can  attend  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  or  individual counselling sessions organised by  social\r\n\r\nservice  centres  in  the  evening.  What  is  needed  is  close\r\n\r\nsupervision  to ensure behavioural compliance with curfew  times\r\n\r\nat identified hours without sacrificing opportunities for group-work activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last suggestion is to spend money to strengthen\r\n\r\ncounselling skills for all officers dealing with addicts.  These\r\n\r\ncounselling  skills  must  include,  Sir,  an  intense  criminal\r\n\r\nassessment  programme  to  identify  the  appropriate  treatment\r\n\r\nschedule that will restore a sense of control in the addict  and\r\n\r\ntap the resource of his family to create an enabling climate for\r\n\r\nhis  recovery.  The plans for strengthening alumni  support  and\r\n\r\nsetting  up  Narcotics  Anonymous for  after-care  recovery  are\r\n\r\ncommendable efforts which must be given priority attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads me to my last reflection - a need for our\r\n\r\nrealistic acceptance of an addict's capacity to lead responsible\r\n\r\nlives.   Sir,  we  cannot hope that, with this  Bill,  the  drug\r\n\r\naddicts, subjected to its harsh\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npunishment, will \"turn over a new leaf\".  Not many of them  will\r\n\r\nbecome  \"robust\" again who are able to pick up their pieces  and\r\n\r\nmove  on  like any normal Singaporean.  The journey is hazardous\r\n\r\nand  an  uphill  one,  thwarted by factors from  psychogenic  to\r\n\r\nfamilial  and socio-structural ones, including gang  and  secret\r\n\r\nsociety  influence from drug syndicates which are ever ready  to\r\n\r\ntempt  them  once again.  I personally learnt of a case  when  a\r\n\r\npeddler  was at the family's door-steps on the very day  of  the\r\n\r\nrelease of a drug addict.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addicts will be in and out of DRCs and half-way houses\r\n\r\nbecause  they  simply lack the skills in taking responsibilities\r\n\r\nfor  their  actions.  The crippling family factors do  not  just\r\n\r\nvanish  while they are in jail, Sir.  After some years of normal\r\n\r\nliving,  they  feel  lonely  again  and  become  re-addicted  by\r\n\r\nsuccumbing to peer group pressures.  By contextualising the drug\r\n\r\naddicts   in   the  larger  picture  of  a  delinquent   culture\r\n\r\ncharacterised  by low education, low self-esteem,  poor  problem\r\n\r\nsolving  skills, inadequate parenting and limited resources,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  accept that the solutions to drug offence  which  this\r\n\r\nBill  sets out to address are more than what one legal tool  can\r\n\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advocates in the sector call for the adoption of a more\r\n\r\ntolerant  attitude  and  a  comprehensive  perspective  by   the\r\n\r\nauthorities  in meting out appropriate sentences and  developing\r\n\r\nmatching treatment models for drug addicts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a tough love policy, Sir, let this Bill take care of the\r\n\r\ntough  part,  but the rest of the prevention and  rehabilitation\r\n\r\nagencies  must  focus  and be supported by  the  State  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity on the \"love\" part to fit the pieces of these  damaged\r\n\r\nlives  together  and  give them a second chance.   And  here,  I\r\n\r\nsupport  Mr  Chiam's call earlier on for more  reinforcement  in\r\n\r\npreventive   rehabilitation  programmes.   I   believe   if   we\r\n\r\nprioritise attention and resources on developing care programmes\r\n\r\nthat  will initiate cognitive, emotional and behavioural changes\r\n\r\nin  disabling individuals and families, in the long  run,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be no need to exercise the instruments of this Bill.  That\r\n\r\nis my hope.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no quarrel with the\r\n\r\nmeasures  taken to deal with drug traffickers and  manufacturers\r\n\r\nof  drugs,  although I was a bit alarmed to hear  one  Nominated\r\n\r\nMember  equating a consumer with a drug pusher.  We are  getting\r\n\r\nnew  definitions.    But I am concerned, as Mr  Chiam  has  been\r\n\r\nconcerned, with the approach taken by the Ministry towards  drug\r\n\r\naddicts and users of drugs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think, as has been emphasised by more\r\n\r\nthan  one speaker, the consumption of drug is a social evil  and\r\n\r\nnot  to  be  categorised as a crime like crimes under the  Penal\r\n\r\nCode  are.  My objection to the clause introducing a new section\r\n\r\n33A  is  that it is bad on two counts.  One, it has the  blanket\r\n\r\napproach without any regard for the particular circumstances  or\r\n\r\nsituation  of the offender.  It is just a blanket approach.   No\r\n\r\ntwo cases are ever the same, Mr Speaker, Sir.  There are persons\r\n\r\nwho  suddenly find themselves caught in a situation  where  they\r\n\r\nslip  in  a  drug and there are others who return  knowingly  to\r\n\r\nconsume  drugs.  The Minister more than once kept  referring  to\r\n\r\nhardcore  addicts.  Who is a \"hardcore addict\"?  Is  a  man  who\r\n\r\npreviously  had had a conviction for using a drug -  or  perhaps\r\n\r\neven two convictions - some years in the past and has tried very\r\n\r\nhard  to keep off drugs and has succeeded for a good many years,\r\n\r\nbut  suddenly he finds himself caught up in a situation with his\r\n\r\nfriends, whom he least suspects, are consuming drugs and on  the\r\n\r\nspur  of the moment, he slips into his body one of these  drugs,\r\n\r\nby  then it is too late. Is he a hardcore addict?  Or is he just\r\n\r\na  victim of an  unfortunate incident?  This Bill does not  seem\r\n\r\nto  cater  for those who might find themselves in that situation\r\n\r\nand  who perhaps find themselves caught for having taken a  drug\r\n\r\nunwittingly.  I know myself of such cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is wrong, in the case of punishments, to treat\r\n\r\nevery case as though it is the same.  They vary, as I said, from\r\n\r\none  individual to another.  And related to this, of course,  it\r\n\r\nis  bad  in principle because it tends to deprive the courts  of\r\n\r\ntheir  function.   Mandatory sentences should  be  kept  to  the\r\n\r\nminimum.  Because under the Constitution, the judicial power in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  is vested with the courts.   And judicial  power,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, includes not just finding persons guilty of offences but\r\n\r\ndeciding  on the appropriate sentences that have to  be  passed.\r\n\r\nSo  this  increasing  tendency to deprive the  courts  of  their\r\n\r\nproper function under the Constitution is to be regretted.   The\r\n\r\ncourts are placed in the best position to judge what sentence is\r\n\r\nadequate  and necessary in the case of the offender  before  it,\r\n\r\nnot  this  House.   Because when we pass  the  Bill,  we  cannot\r\n\r\ncontemplate the myriad of situations that might arise.   We  can\r\n\r\nonly  stipulate the approach that should be taken and then leave\r\n\r\nit  to the courts to decide on the specific sentence that should\r\n\r\nbe passed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at this new section 33A, Mr Speaker, Sir, it\r\n\r\nproposes  to  punish  not just hardcore  addicts.   I  wish  the\r\n\r\nMinister had tried to define what he meant by \"hardcore  addict\"\r\n\r\nbut  people  who fail to provide a urine specimen with  enhanced\r\n\r\npunishments.   The  Minister was singling out  persons  who  are\r\n\r\narrested  and  who  refuse to give their samples  of  urine  for\r\n\r\ntesting.   I  would like to know from the Minister does  it  not\r\n\r\nalso include persons who miss out perhaps once from attending at\r\n\r\nthe  police stations or CNB for their urine tests where they are\r\n\r\nunder a supervision order?  A person may miss out on one of  his\r\n\r\nurine  tests for a great many reasons.  But if he is to be  sent\r\n\r\nto  prison  for  five years just because he has had  a  previous\r\n\r\nconviction  or  admission and he has failed  in  one  particular\r\n\r\ninstance  to  report for his urine test, it seems to  me  to  be\r\n\r\nunusually  harsh  and,  may I say especially  with  the  caning,\r\n\r\ntotally  inhumane.   It does not take into account  at  all  the\r\n\r\nsituation of the person concerned.  So it is my concern that the\r\n\r\nnew  punishments violate, as I said, the principle that  no  two\r\n\r\noffenders  are  in  the  same position  and  should  be  treated\r\n\r\ndifferently  and, secondly, far more importantly, they  encroach\r\n\r\non the jurisdiction and function of the courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge that the Ministry consider a proviso to this\r\n\r\nsection,  allowing the courts to inquire into the  circumstances\r\n\r\nwhich led the person to miss out on a urine test, or to take the\r\n\r\ndrug for which he\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  charged.   And  if  there  are special  circumstances  which\r\n\r\nwarrant  that the court should not pass the mandatory  sentence,\r\n\r\nthe  court  should  be empowered to do so.  We  have  a  similar\r\n\r\nprovision in the case of drivers who have to be disqualified for\r\n\r\noffences  under the Road Traffic Act or for using motor vehicles\r\n\r\nwithout insurance.  There the courts are given the power not  to\r\n\r\norder  disqualification of a year or more where, in the view  of\r\n\r\nthe  court,  there  are special circumstances that  warrant  not\r\n\r\npassing the term of disqualification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also question, as Mr Chiam has done, the need to\r\n\r\nimpose  caning?   This new sentence provides for  a  minimum  of\r\n\r\nthree strokes and also for a minimum of six strokes.  It used to\r\n\r\nbe  the law at one time that caning should only be ordered  when\r\n\r\nthe  criminal  himself  has resorted to violence.   But  we,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, would appear to be lashing out for every offence.   I\r\n\r\nknow this is not popular with the establishment but may I remind\r\n\r\nthe  Government that in other enlightened societies,  caning  is\r\n\r\nstrictly forbidden.  The European Court of Human Rights has held\r\n\r\nmore  than  once  that  caning degrades  the  human  being,  the\r\n\r\nindividual,  and is illegal under the Universal  Declaration  of\r\n\r\nHuman Rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been stressed by many a speaker, and particularly by\r\n\r\nMadam  Chiang, drug taking is a social problem, not only  to  be\r\n\r\ndealt with by just lashing out but also by taking positive steps\r\n\r\nto  rehabilitate and to keep people off drugs.  Very  little  is\r\n\r\nbeing  done,  it  would appear, on that level.  Youths  turn  to\r\n\r\ndrugs because they are bored, because they have no jobs, because\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing  better for them to do  to  get  out  of  the\r\n\r\ndepression  in their lives except to take something  which  will\r\n\r\nmake  them high.  What is being done socially to make our  young\r\n\r\npeople  see the wrongdoing of resorting to drugs and opening  up\r\n\r\nnew  opportunities for them where they can direct their energies\r\n\r\nand  put  them to use?  Is it a reluctance on the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to spend a bit more money on this and  to  leave  it\r\n\r\nentirely to private organisations?  We should like to know\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  from  the Minister, as has been asked, as to what  exactly\r\n\r\nthe Government is doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to say a\r\n\r\nfew words.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to support the Bill. However, I\r\n\r\nfind  that it is interesting to listen to the views of Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nSee  Tong,  Madam Chiang and the like, and that is to make  this\r\n\r\nBill  full of compassion.  I think there are sufficient agencies\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, whether it is rehabilitation, prevention or other\r\n\r\nsocial agencies, to take care of the emotional and compassionate\r\n\r\npart of it.  Let us be very relevant and focused today.  We  are\r\n\r\ndealing  with the misuse of drugs.  If he were to study  history\r\n\r\nand  learn about the Opium War, then Mr Chiam would not want  to\r\n\r\nmake that kind of comment, so compassionate to the drug pushers,\r\n\r\ntraffickers  and, indeed, the recalcitrants.  We must  ask  this\r\n\r\nquestion: at the end of the day, this particular Bill,  when  it\r\n\r\nis  enacted,  would  it  serve the  purpose  of  prevention  and\r\n\r\ndeterrence?  To me, at the end of the day, it does.  We must  be\r\n\r\ncruel to be kind.  We are dealing with a lethal weapon which  is\r\n\r\nsufficient  enough  to  destroy the  well-being  of  a  society.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I believe that the introduction of new section 33A is\r\n\r\na good section to deter people from abusing drugs.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  I  would make a further suggestion.  There is  no  need\r\n\r\nreally  to  differentiate  a Class 1  consumer  and  a  Class  2\r\n\r\nconsumer,  ie,  those who are caught under  section  33A(1)  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  are caught under section 33A(2).  I think we  should\r\n\r\njust  go  straight to make them suffer by giving them  not  less\r\n\r\nthan  seven  years of imprisonment, of course not more  than  13\r\n\r\nyears, and give them six to 12 strokes of caning.  In this  way,\r\n\r\nwe would be able to send a very strong message to the nation and\r\n\r\nto  the people of Singapore: Do not even come near it.  That  is\r\n\r\nmost important and let us not take the emotional aspect of it in\r\n\r\ndealing with this particular Bill.\r\n\r\nLet  us  be really focused.  Let us take into consideration  the\r\n\r\nwell-being  of  the  great  majority  of  Singaporeans  and  the\r\n\r\nprogress and prosperity of Singapore into\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconsideration.  By being very friendly to the users, pushers and\r\n\r\ntraffickers, we are doing a misdeed to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me\r\n\r\nto  speak.  Certainly, the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill  has\r\n\r\ntwo  main aims.  One is tackled by the Bill specifically,  which\r\n\r\nis   deterrence,  punishment  and  prevention.   That  has  been\r\n\r\nadequately  addressed.   But  to  lend  support  to   my   other\r\n\r\ncolleagues, which has been  mentioned earlier, I feel obliged to\r\n\r\nstand  up  and  highlight the other point of rehabilitation  and\r\n\r\nthrough  our  own  way of doing it, which is through  self-help,\r\n\r\nreligious  and  ethnic mix of organisations.   This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nserious  problem which even the Government on its own would  not\r\n\r\nbe able to solve the problem of rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nAs  far as deterrence is  concerned, the provision for long term\r\n\r\nprison  sentences is indeed welcome.  We should  be  harsh  with\r\n\r\nsuch  an  abuse  that has wide social implications.   Many  have\r\n\r\nbecome  victims  and  uncured  throughout  their  life.   Anyone\r\n\r\nreading  this Bill would indeed be frightened, in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nseverity of the punishment.  On the one hand, we should  not  be\r\n\r\ntempted  to take a soft stand on this issue.  On this matter,  I\r\n\r\ntherefore support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One implication of this Bill is the provision for longer\r\n\r\nprison  sentences.  I do hope that the longer time  the  inmates\r\n\r\nspend in prison could also be spent in rehabilitation.  In  view\r\n\r\nof  the complexity and difficulty of rehabilitation, one nagging\r\n\r\nproblem of this issue is the high level of relapse among abusers\r\n\r\nwho undergo rehabilitation.  I have a number of suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is for more effective rehabilitation programmes. I\r\n\r\nhope  the  rehabilitation of these inmates can start early  from\r\n\r\nthe day they are identified right to the day they are completely\r\n\r\nrecovered.    I  would  like  to ask the  Minister  whether  the\r\n\r\ninvolvement of ethnic-based and religious groups can be provided\r\n\r\nearly in the rehabilitation programme even while the inmates are\r\n\r\nin  prison.   If  this is so, I would like to ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether he would consider giving more help to these groups\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  professional assistance and help in managing  and\r\n\r\norganising  half-way houses.  I have found through  my  work  in\r\n\r\nSCORE that most of these religious and\r\n\r\nethnic-based  organisations  are indeed  very  enthusiastic  and\r\n\r\nmotivated, largely due to their evangelical work.  But they  are\r\n\r\nusually  in  dire  need  of  financial  and  professional  help,\r\n\r\nespecially   when  the  problems  of  drug  abuse  are   usually\r\n\r\nassociated  with complex social and psychological  problems.   I\r\n\r\ncertainly know that this problem is indeed one that has occupied\r\n\r\nmany  Malay/Muslim organisations, in view of the severity and  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  problems  of Muslim addicts.  They  have  the  right\r\n\r\nmotivation  and  enthusiasm,  but  certainly  professional   and\r\n\r\nfinancial help is indeed welcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore also like the Minister to provide other\r\n\r\nhelp  and  assistance  in terms of strengthening  the  role  and\r\n\r\ncapability  of half-way houses to deal with this aspect  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem of rehabilitation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for making their\r\n\r\ncontributions to debate this Bill.  Some no doubt  have  done  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  serious work because, from their speeches, I know  that\r\n\r\nthey  have spent time talking to people. Some even have personal\r\n\r\nexperiences  from  people they meet.  Indeed, they  are  serious\r\n\r\nspeeches  which  I would take seriously.  There  are  also  some\r\n\r\nspeeches  which are tedious because they are just  a  rehash  of\r\n\r\nsome of the themes that I have heard in this House from time  to\r\n\r\ntime and I would try to respond to them as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the concerns of Members here can be classified\r\n\r\ninto  several areas, and let me take them one at a time.  First,\r\n\r\ntake  the  question of rehabilitation.  I think  those  who  are\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  the  work of drug prevention,  rehabilitation  and\r\n\r\neducation will know that over the last few years, we have indeed\r\n\r\nput in a lot of time, effort, money and resources in helping the\r\n\r\nvarious  groups  to improve their capabilities in rehabilitating\r\n\r\naddicts who want to recover.  Setting up of half-way houses, for\r\n\r\nexample,  was done many years ago, but in the last few years  we\r\n\r\nhave intensified this effort and the Government has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso  given  them funds to help these addicts and  to  help  the\r\n\r\nmanagement of half-way houses manage the half-way houses.\r\n\r\nWe  have  also  helped half-way houses to look for property  and\r\n\r\npremises  where  they can build facilities for these  recovering\r\n\r\naddicts.   Now, I believe we have 14 such half-way  houses.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  capacity in some of them are not  even  full.   Some\r\n\r\nstill  have  capacity left.  Even to stay in  a  half-way  house\r\n\r\nrequires  discipline, determination and the will  power  of  the\r\n\r\naddict  to  say, \"I want to remain in the half-way house  to  be\r\n\r\nrehabilitated.\"   Sometimes, despite all  the  good-heartedness,\r\n\r\nthe  love  and  the hard work put in by volunteers  in  half-way\r\n\r\nhouses, some of these volunteers do feel disheartened that these\r\n\r\naddicts  just do not have the discipline to take the  treatment.\r\n\r\nBut  the  Government will do what it can to help them, ie,  both\r\n\r\nthese recovering addicts as well as the half-way houses.\r\n\r\nIn  terms  of financial support, I think if they can  justify  a\r\n\r\ncase  to  ask  for  more money, we will  look  at  it,  but  the\r\n\r\nGovernment does not just spend money, throwing good money  after\r\n\r\nbad  money  to  people  who do not want to change.   Ultimately,\r\n\r\nwhether  an addict wants to recover or not, must depend  on  the\r\n\r\nperson  himself  or herself.  No amount of love,  no  amount  of\r\n\r\nharsh punishment, no amount of money we throw at him or her, can\r\n\r\nmake  a  person change if he does not want to change.   I  think\r\n\r\nvolunteers  who have seen these people will know  that  some  of\r\n\r\nthem  are  just  desperate cases.  Let me assure those  who  are\r\n\r\nhelping  in  half-way  houses and  those  who  are  involved  in\r\n\r\nvoluntary  programmes that indeed we will  continue  to  provide\r\n\r\nassistance where necessary.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, if Members will recall, when I announced some of these\r\n\r\nmeasures in this House more than a couple of years ago,  I  said\r\n\r\nthat we are going to set up a dedicated unit in SCORE (Singapore\r\n\r\nCooperative  and  Rehabilitative Enterprises)  to  counsel  drug\r\n\r\naddicts.  Indeed, such a unit had been set up.  Today,  we  have\r\n\r\nmore  than  30 professional full-time counsellors.  These  full-time counsellors\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  not only counsel addicts who are in prison or the DRCs  or\r\n\r\nthose  who  need assistance, but they also provide  professional\r\n\r\nassistance  to  those half-way houses and other counsellors  who\r\n\r\nwant  additional  back-up or training.  Indeed,  I  have  always\r\n\r\nencouraged  them to share their resources, their  expertise  and\r\n\r\nthe knowledge that they have gained in such counselling sessions\r\n\r\nwith  anyone  who is interested.  But again, sometimes  people's\r\n\r\npatience  can  be very thin and despite the help that  we  give,\r\n\r\naddicts  do not want to change, and volunteers simply  give  up.\r\n\r\nIf  Members recall, years ago, SANA used to have many  voluntary\r\n\r\ncounsellors.   Today, many of them have given  up  because  they\r\n\r\nhave seen how difficult it is to change a person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also mentioned in this House examples of addicts who\r\n\r\nhave  been  in and out of the DRC and prison a number of  times,\r\n\r\nsome  even  more  than a dozen times, and they have  not  learnt\r\n\r\ntheir  lesson.  So why do we have an amendment like this in  our\r\n\r\nlaw?   It  is for these people who just simply refuse to change.\r\n\r\nRather  than  letting them go to the DRC every  time  we  arrest\r\n\r\nthem,  and  then letting them out again after a few  months,  or\r\n\r\neven  after a maximum of three years, then before long they  are\r\n\r\ncaught  again,  back to the DRC, after they  have  served  their\r\n\r\ntime,  rehabilitation in the DRC, they went out again, but  they\r\n\r\nare  caught  time  and  again; rather  than  wasting  our  time,\r\n\r\nresources  and CNB's professional resources on such  people,  we\r\n\r\nhave  decided  that the only way to treat these  addicts  is  to\r\n\r\nimprison them for a long time.\r\n\r\nWhen  I served this notice in 1996 that we would imprison  these\r\n\r\naddicts  for a long time, ie, a minimum of five years  to  seven\r\n\r\nyears,  if  they are caught again the third time, many  parents,\r\n\r\nself-help  groups and volunteers really welcomed  this  measure.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, their view was that this was long overdue and ought to\r\n\r\nhave been done much earlier.  Then we would not have a situation\r\n\r\nas  I  have reported in this House in 1994 when we had more than\r\n\r\n8,900 addicts in our DRCs.  Even for the addicts themselves  who\r\n\r\nwere serving in the DRCs at that time, my Director of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPrisons  told me then that when this announcement  was  made  in\r\n\r\n1996,  many  of them were very worried.  They were worried  that\r\n\r\nsince they have got one record, or two records, and if they went\r\n\r\nout  again and get caught repeatedly, they would be in for these\r\n\r\nnew  measures.  Indeed, from the statistics that  I  see  today,\r\n\r\nthere  has been an improvement in the number of first  time  and\r\n\r\nsecond time drug addicts that we arrested recently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take an example. In 1994, when I reported to this\r\n\r\nHouse,  we  had about 8,900 addicts in our DRCs, of which  17.3%\r\n\r\nwere  first timers, that means, they were caught the first  time\r\n\r\nand  were  in  our DRCs.  It does not mean that they  were  only\r\n\r\nabusing  drugs for the first time they were caught.   These  are\r\n\r\nvery  different.   It just happened that they  could  have  been\r\n\r\nusing drugs for some time and finally got caught by the CNB, and\r\n\r\nwe  classify them as first timers.  Mind you, they may have been\r\n\r\ntaking  drugs for, who knows, three years, five years,  and  not\r\n\r\ncaught,  and they were lucky to get away with it.  We had  17.3%\r\n\r\nof these first timers in 1994 in the DRCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in 1997, that number had dropped to 10.9%, and up to March\r\n\r\nthis year, that number had dropped to 10.7%.  In other words, we\r\n\r\nnow  see a decline of the first timer drug addicts in our  DRCs.\r\n\r\nThis  is despite the very rigorous enforcement actions that  the\r\n\r\nCNB  has been taking in the last few years, the number has  been\r\n\r\ngoing down.  Since 1996/1997, CNB has had Operation Dragnet  and\r\n\r\nall  kinds of code names that they used to arrest these  people.\r\n\r\nYou  have  read them in the papers.  And this has been going  on\r\n\r\nfor  a  long time.  Despite such rigorous enforcement action  by\r\n\r\nthe  CNB,  the number of first timer addicts arrested  has  gone\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also monitor the number of new addicts. The number of new\r\n\r\naddicts  caught  for the first time has also  gone  down.   What\r\n\r\nabout  the second timers?  The same situation appears.  In 1994,\r\n\r\nfor  second  timers, those who were caught for  taking  drugs  a\r\n\r\nsecond  time  round, they could have been after being  released,\r\n\r\nhaving  been  caught  the first time, maybe undetected  for  two\r\n\r\nyears, three years, one\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyear, or six months, for who knows how long, arrested again  the\r\n\r\nsecond  time, there were 17.4% of them.  But in 1997, they  were\r\n\r\njust  about the same, 18.2%; March 1998, about the same,  18.2%.\r\n\r\nBut those who were arrested the third time or more has increased\r\n\r\nfrom 66.3% to 71.1%, and this was out of an addict population in\r\n\r\nthe  DRCs of 5,500 in 1997.  In other words, the number of  drug\r\n\r\naddicts  in  our  DRCs saw a decline from about 8,900  to  about\r\n\r\n5,500,  and today, I am talking about May, the number  has  even\r\n\r\ngone down further, despite rigorous CNB enforcement actions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, just the announcement of the new measures has already\r\n\r\nhad  an  effect on the addicts.  Why do we cane them?   I  think\r\n\r\nthey  really  cannot learn.  Some of them just do  not  want  to\r\n\r\nlearn.   Some of them just have no will and no determination  to\r\n\r\nlearn.   So, by keeping them in the prison for a long  time,  we\r\n\r\nwill   actually  save  them  from  the  clutches  of  the   drug\r\n\r\ntraffickers.   That is one.  Secondly, we also could  save  them\r\n\r\nfrom  committing  crime and be punished under other  laws.   And\r\n\r\nthirdly, certainly they ought to be in there to reflect  and  be\r\n\r\nrehabilitated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What rehabilitation programmes do we have for them? They\r\n\r\nwill  be treated like any other prisoners.  We rehabilitate  our\r\n\r\nprisoners, we give them work, we give them training.  Those  who\r\n\r\nwant to study actually attend courses - you may not know that  - they  can do GCE \"O\" level, \"N\" level, \"A\" level, ITE,  if  they\r\n\r\nhave  the will and the interest to study.  But not many want  to\r\n\r\ndo  that because, I suppose, they just gave up their studies and\r\n\r\nthat  is why they went to do other things, like committing crime\r\n\r\nor taking drugs.  So I think we have to be really tough in order\r\n\r\nto  be kind to them.  And I do not think there is any other  way\r\n\r\nto treat them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these measures succeed in bringing down the number of drug\r\n\r\naddicts,  I  think it will serve the nation's purpose,  it  will\r\n\r\nserve   the  community's  interest,  and  it  will  serve  their\r\n\r\nfamilies'  interest,  because then the  family  will  know  that\r\n\r\nindeed  this person hopefully can be changed.  Indeed,  we  also\r\n\r\ninvolve the family in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncounselling  and  rehabilitation.   Recently,  in  fact,   Taman\r\n\r\nBacaan, for example, has introduced a family education programme\r\n\r\nfor  the  new addicts.  Before they are released, their  parents\r\n\r\nare  brought in.  But, mind you, not every parent is  interested\r\n\r\nin  his son or daughter who has taken drugs.  Some simply refuse\r\n\r\nto  have anything to do with them; some do not want to turn  up;\r\n\r\nmaybe  some are too busy to turn up.  But SCORE, Prisons or  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary half-way houses will try to involve the parents in the\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  efforts, wherever possible.   However,  not  all\r\n\r\ncases are possible; some cases are just impossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now try to deal with some of the specific comments.\r\n\r\nBefore I get into that, let me talk about campaigns.  Mr Kenneth\r\n\r\nChen  and  Mr  Chiam said that maybe we should have more  public\r\n\r\neducation,  more campaigns, etc.  Indeed, we have.   There  have\r\n\r\nbeen  a  lot  of campaigns in recent years to inform the  public\r\n\r\nabout the drug problem.  Since I raised this problem in 1994, we\r\n\r\nhave  had  a  series of seminars, workshops,  even  concerts  to\r\n\r\npublicise  this problem that we have.  And we had  a  seminar  a\r\n\r\ncouple  of months ago, and we have a concert against drug  abuse\r\n\r\nat  the  end of this month.  For those people who are interested\r\n\r\nin  helping us to publicise the message of drug abuse,  we  have\r\n\r\ngot such a concert planned.  Similarly, we have also worked with\r\n\r\nthe schools.  The CNB officers and Police officers have gone  to\r\n\r\nthe  schools  to talk about the problem and to talk to  students\r\n\r\nwho are likely to fall into the trap of being a drug addict, and\r\n\r\ntry  to  explain to them the dangers of drug abuse.   All  these\r\n\r\nefforts have been going on and the schools have indeed been very\r\n\r\nhappy with the education programmes that CNB has worked together\r\n\r\nwith them in publicising the drug abuse message.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there has also been some mis-reading of some of the new\r\n\r\nsections  of the Bill.  For example, Mr Chiam said  that  for  a\r\n\r\nsecond  timer  drug offender, he would be caught and  caned.   I\r\n\r\nthink  that  is not right.  We only catch people who  are  third\r\n\r\ntimers.   In other words, they are caught the third  time.   [Mr\r\n\r\nChiam See Tong\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninterjected.]  No, third time.  Let me assure him  that  -  read\r\n\r\nthis carefully - it is only for the third time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You have got section 33 for the second timer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Please read this section carefully, and\r\n\r\nlisten to me carefully.  I will come to you afterwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Rai asked whether CNB Narcotics Officers\r\n\r\nshould not be part of the Police Force.  I think they are  doing\r\n\r\na  very  good job.  There is no need to include them as part  of\r\n\r\nthe Police Force.  But they do have certain powers of the Police\r\n\r\nofficers  and  they  have the same scheme of service  as  Police\r\n\r\nofficers.  Of course, they have other kinds of allowances.   And\r\n\r\nit  is better that in order for us to deal with this problem, we\r\n\r\ntarget this specially ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Minister, I was just thinking whether there\r\n\r\ncould be a transfer of Police officers to CNB and vice versa.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes, whenever necessary, and if need be. In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  do  not  have  a  system of closed  service.   Police\r\n\r\nofficers  who are interested to become CNB officers  could  join\r\n\r\nthe  CNB or if there are certain posts that we need to fill  but\r\n\r\nwe cannot find enough officers, we will find officers from other\r\n\r\nservices.  For your information, the Director of CNB is a Police\r\n\r\nofficer, and there are also others like him in the Force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang talked about social integration and work. I\r\n\r\nthink  she  has also found out that indeed ISCOS, together  with\r\n\r\nSCORE, do help these recovering addicts find jobs, and they have\r\n\r\na  section to help them look for jobs and, in fact, they do have\r\n\r\nwork  for them to keep them away from their previous company  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  possible.   But really it is up to the  individual  who\r\n\r\nwants  to  change.  But whether we should lift  the  curfew  for\r\n\r\nthose under electronic monitoring system or not, I think we have\r\n\r\nto consider this very carefully.  Because for some of them, they\r\n\r\nreally need a period of curfew.  They\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneed  to stay at home, particularly during the vulnerable  times\r\n\r\nin  the  evenings after work, they ought to stay  at  home  with\r\n\r\ntheir  family  rather than to be tempted to mix  up  again  with\r\n\r\ntheir former peers, and therefore be susceptible to drugs again.\r\n\r\nBut  she  has  also made other suggestions which I will  ask  my\r\n\r\nofficials  to  look at and, if they are workable,  certainly  we\r\n\r\nwill implement them.  But we will have to discuss that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam said that we should try to define what a hard-core\r\n\r\naddict  is.   But  I do not know what he was doing  when  I  was\r\n\r\nexplaining what a hard-core addict is.  I suppose he can do that\r\n\r\nby reading the Bill later on if he has the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Tell us again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> All Members here know. I do not think I need\r\n\r\nto  repeat what I have said earlier.  If he refuses or  did  not\r\n\r\nwant to listen or was sleeping earlier on, I see no reason why I\r\n\r\nshould waste everybody's time repeating what I have said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also asked about a case of a person under a\r\n\r\nsupervision  order  and was required to  report  at  the  police\r\n\r\nstation,  but did not turn up at the police station and  whether\r\n\r\nhe  was  deemed to have refused to provide a urine specimen.   I\r\n\r\nthink  if he had listened to my speech, he would know that  that\r\n\r\nis  not the person I am referring to.  When I said that a person\r\n\r\nrefuses  to  provide a urine specimen, I meant that when  he  is\r\n\r\nrequired  to do so, ie, when he was asked to produce  his  urine\r\n\r\nsample,  the person says, \"I don't want to.\"  Then he  would  be\r\n\r\nsubject to that regime.

So, that is\r\n\r\nwhy I said that some people do serious research work before they\r\n\r\ncome  to  the House; some people just look at the Bill and  then\r\n\r\nask  questions without really taking the time to understand what\r\n\r\nthe law is really all about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli asked about the rehabilitation for his people who\r\n\r\nare in long term imprisonment.  I said that they will be treated\r\n\r\nlike  any  other prisoners and be rehabilitated like  any  other\r\n\r\nprisoners.  For the self-help groups that need additional  help,\r\n\r\nprofessional  assistance, etc, we will try  to  extend  to  them\r\n\r\nwhatever assistance that can be justifiably made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point, which I forgot to mention, is about Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam's   earlier  example  on  section  33A,   in   making\r\n\r\ndistinction between people who were caught a third time  because\r\n\r\nthey  could  have been unwittingly taking drugs the second  time\r\n\r\nand  therefore caught under this section.  It is very  difficult\r\n\r\nreally  for  the law to make a distinction for different  people\r\n\r\nwith different circumstances.  I think in this instance, we  are\r\n\r\nvery  clear.  Anyone with a first drug record is a first  timer.\r\n\r\nAnyone with a second drug record is a second timer.  And if that\r\n\r\nperson is caught a third time, he is a third timer.  In fact, if\r\n\r\nyou  ask  them  why they took drugs the first time,  the  second\r\n\r\ntime, and the third time, each of them will give you a different\r\n\r\ngrandmother's story.  And I think it is very difficult for us to\r\n\r\ngo   and  ascertain  the  veracity  or  truthfulness  of   their\r\n\r\ngrandmother's story.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask by way of a clarification? The\r\n\r\nMinister quite rightly says it is very difficult for us, meaning\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry.  I  take it, or this House, to decide  whether  a\r\n\r\nperson is a hard-core addict or not.  We can only go on standard\r\n\r\ndefinitions.   But  would he not agree that if  the  courts  are\r\n\r\ngiven the power to inquire, they can make the inquiry, they  can\r\n\r\ncall   for   a  report,  and  then  decide  on  the  appropriate\r\n\r\npunishment?  Would the Minister at least concede that the courts\r\n\r\nhave the power and can do it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the courts will decide based on\r\n\r\nwhat is in the law.  The law is made in Parliament, and what  is\r\n\r\nproposed  in  the  Bill is a matter of Government  policy.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  decided that this be the  policy  for  treating\r\n\r\nhardcore  addicts and it will be written down  in  the  law  and\r\n\r\npassed  in this House, and the court will interpret it according\r\n\r\nto  the  law.  I do not think I need to explain in great  detail\r\n\r\nhow the Judiciary, the Legislature and the Executive really work\r\n\r\nbecause I think Members ought to know.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Just a point of clarification.\r\n\r\nI  agree  with  the Minister that we do not need to  spend  more\r\n\r\nmoney and resources on hardcore addicts, and he was right to say\r\n\r\nthat  unless they are willing to change, no amount  of  love  or\r\n\r\nharsh  penalties will change them.  I am merely urging for  more\r\n\r\nfocused attention on first-time offenders and I think we need to\r\n\r\nlook  at  best  practices and treatment models  to  rehabilitate\r\n\r\nthem.  I would like to inform Members of this House that the New\r\n\r\nDirection, for example, one of the half-way houses, is run by ex-drug  addicts.  Four of the directors are doing incredibly  good\r\n\r\nwork   and   that  is  the  testimony  to  early  rehabilitation\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the electronic monitoring system, I agree with the Minister\r\n\r\nthat  they need to stay at home but some of the social  workers,\r\n\r\nin  doing  counselling  work, find it difficult  to  reach  them\r\n\r\nbecause  they cannot come out at night and a lot of the  classes\r\n\r\nand  counselling sessions are in the evenings.  I think it is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  administration.  We can  monitor  them.   But,  Sir,\r\n\r\nplease consider that during that period\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhen  they have to spend time with their family, it is also  the\r\n\r\nperiod  when they need early counselling sessions.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nshould see how they could respond to both needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, if it is practical to really allow\r\n\r\na  recovering addict who is on the electronic monitoring  system\r\n\r\nto  be out of the home for counselling session, then I would ask\r\n\r\nmy officials to consider that.  For rehabilitating first timers,\r\n\r\nindeed, I think that is a point which we recognise, and that  is\r\n\r\nthe  effort  and  focus of attention put in  by  our  after-care\r\n\r\npersonnel, volunteers, professional counsellors in the  DRCs  as\r\n\r\nwell  as in SCORE.  We hope that these first timers, people  who\r\n\r\nare  caught  the first time and went to DRCs, will change  after\r\n\r\nbeing caught the first time, and that is why we have spent a lot\r\n\r\nof  time  trying to talk them out of it and not  be  caught  the\r\n\r\nsecond  time.  So I think the emphasis is correct  and  we  will\r\n\r\nspend our resources on these people who want to change, and  who\r\n\r\ncan be changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng ].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But  may  I  assure the House that I have  no  pecuniary\r\n\r\ninterest in this motion.  The cases have all been dealt with and\r\n\r\nmy  interest is purely one of seeing that justice is meted  out,\r\n\r\nas  it should be, to our citizens, particularly in the field  of\r\n\r\ncriminal  justice.  Sir, if you feel that I should not  vote  on\r\n\r\nthis  at  the end of the motion, perhaps you would let me  know,\r\n\r\nbut I have no pecuniary interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I make no apology for troubling this House with this\r\n\r\nmotion  in  the  midst  of the economic woes  that  Members  are\r\n\r\nperhaps more concerned with.  But as has been pointed out,  part\r\n\r\nof the economic woes stems from the lack of accountability, lack\r\n\r\nof  justice  in  the  system, lack of transparency.   Therefore,\r\n\r\njustice is important.  In fact, I would say that the first  duty\r\n\r\nof  any  government is to provide justice to all  its  citizens.\r\n\r\nAnd  it  is  not  just  criminal justice,  of  course,  economic\r\n\r\njustice, social justice, but criminal justice forms an important\r\n\r\npart of it.  Because in the way criminal justice is administered\r\n\r\nwill  largely  depend on the stability of the society.   If  the\r\n\r\nsociety begins to have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndoubts  and  to lose confidence in the way criminal  justice  is\r\n\r\nadministered,  then  society will suffer  and  it  may  lead  to\r\n\r\ninstability  in the society.  So I make no apology, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that the aim of criminal justice is two-fold.\r\n\r\nOne  is  to  see that the guilty in the society, the wrongdoers,\r\n\r\nare  brought  to  justice and punished.   That is  an  important\r\n\r\nduty.   But  equally important, and some may rate it  even  more\r\n\r\nimportant, the duty of society must be to see that those who are\r\n\r\ninnocent,  those  who  are not guilty of any  misdoing,  of  any\r\n\r\ncrime, do not suffer punishment unfairly or unnecessarily.  That\r\n\r\nis  important.    And the importance of this has  been  stressed\r\n\r\ntime and time again, and I do not wish to remind Members of  the\r\n\r\npronouncements from the courts, not only in this country but  in\r\n\r\nthe  other countries, of the need to protect the innocent.   And\r\n\r\ncriminal justice, Mr Speaker, Sir, is not to be confined to just\r\n\r\nhow  the courts deal with the offenders, persons who are brought\r\n\r\nbefore  it.   The greater part of criminal justice is  concerned\r\n\r\nwith the investigation, the inquiries, that are conducted by the\r\n\r\npolice  and  the  enforcement agencies before  the  persons  are\r\n\r\nbrought  to  court to be charged with offences.   And  this  was\r\n\r\nstressed  in  a  report in the United Kingdom in 1993  when  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  appointed a  Royal Commission on  Criminal  Justice,\r\n\r\nfollowing an outcry that several persons had been convicted  and\r\n\r\nsentenced to serve terms in prison when they were later found to\r\n\r\nbe  totally  innocent.  May I quote from  this  report?   It  is\r\n\r\nCommand 2263 submitted in 1993.  I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The protection of suspects from unfair or unreasonable\r\n\r\npressure is as important to the criminal justice system  as  the\r\n\r\nthoroughness   with   which   the   police   carry   out   their\r\n\r\ninvestigations.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the Commissioners were stressing the importance of protecting\r\n\r\nthe  suspects  and  those  who  are  innocent  from  unfair   or\r\n\r\nunreasonable pressure in any investigation into crimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in any society where the rule of law\r\n\r\nobtains, no innocent person should fear that he or she may  find\r\n\r\nhimself or herself convicted of some offence or crime.  That  is\r\n\r\nimportant, that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nevery  person  should  live with that  conviction  and  to  that\r\n\r\nextent,  legislatures have enacted laws to protect  subjects  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  only the guilty are punished and the innocent  are\r\n\r\nnot  punished.  The tragedy is that it is always  the  weak  who\r\n\r\nsuffer  if these laws do not protect them.  It is the weak,  the\r\n\r\nuneducated, the illiterate, who stand in greater danger of being\r\n\r\nconvicted even though they may be innocent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose, very briefly, to examine what the law in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is, to provide this protection to our people.   First\r\n\r\nof  all, the police powers of arrest.  Under the law, the police\r\n\r\nmay arrest anyone without a warrant when they have committed  an\r\n\r\noffence or there is credible information or reasonable suspicion\r\n\r\nof  them  having committed an offence of which report  has  been\r\n\r\nmade.   But  the  police do not always act strictly  under  this\r\n\r\nsection.  We heard earlier in the debate about drug addicts  and\r\n\r\nthe incidence of crime among drug addicts.  So they are a likely\r\n\r\nsource for the police, and this was, of course, highlighted by a\r\n\r\nQueen's  Counsel  in  England who wrote  on  the  targetting  of\r\n\r\ncriminals.  The police pick up who they think are persons likely\r\n\r\nto  have committed the offence without bothering too much  about\r\n\r\nwhether the information or the complaint is reasonable for  them\r\n\r\nto act upon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the question of police custody. Once a\r\n\r\nperson is picked up and is taken into police custody, there  is,\r\n\r\nunder  the  Constitution, a maximum limit of 48 hours  that  the\r\n\r\npolice  may hold anyone in custody before they produce  them  in\r\n\r\nthe  courts.  But, unfortunately, this protection of  not  being\r\n\r\nkept  in  police custody too long is eroded by the readiness  of\r\n\r\nthe  courts to grant such custody almost as soon as it is asked.\r\n\r\nSo  we have cases where the police put a holding charge, as they\r\n\r\ncall it, produce the man in court and say, \"We want more time to\r\n\r\ninvestigate.  May we have a week's custody?\"  The courts,  as  I\r\n\r\nsay,  grant this custody without inquiring too much into whether\r\n\r\nthat custody is necessary or not.  This length of police custody\r\n\r\ncan  continue  sometimes with weekly remands for  six  weeks  or\r\n\r\nmore,  and I shall illustrate from a case to which I shall refer\r\n\r\nat some length.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDuring this police custody, the police deny, until they say they\r\n\r\nhave  finished their investigations, any visits from any  family\r\n\r\nmembers to see the person who has been arrested, ie, to see  the\r\n\r\nsuspect  and  to see whether he needs to be helped in  any  way.\r\n\r\nThis denial can again stretch to three weeks in some cases,  and\r\n\r\nhas  stretched  to  three  weeks, despite  the  Article  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution which says that any person who is arrested shall be\r\n\r\ninformed  of  his  charge against him and shall  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nconsult a lawyer of his choice as soon as possible.  The courts,\r\n\r\nway  back in 1983, I think, held that that meant that the police\r\n\r\ncould  withhold  visit from counsel or consultation  until  they\r\n\r\nhave closed their investigations.  As I said, investigations can\r\n\r\nstretch  for up to six weeks. During all that time, the  man  is\r\n\r\ndenied  any right of consultation with his lawyer and is  denied\r\n\r\nany family visit.  He is totally at the mercy of the police.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the questioning of suspects in police custody.\r\n\r\nThere were at one time certain rules about police questioning of\r\n\r\npersons.   They were taken from the Judges Rules in Britain  and\r\n\r\nmade  a  part of the Criminal Procedure Code, but that  has  all\r\n\r\nbeen swept away.  So there are no guidelines and no restrictions\r\n\r\non  the  length of questioning of suspects by the police and  to\r\n\r\nthe conditions under which the questioning may be carried out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the law about the recording of statements from accused\r\n\r\npersons.   The  law at one time was that no confession  made  by\r\n\r\nanyone  in  police custody was admissible in any  court  of  law\r\n\r\nunless  that confession was made before a magistrate.  That  was\r\n\r\nswept  away.   The position now is that statements made  to  any\r\n\r\nofficer  of  the  police of the rank of Sergeant  and  above  is\r\n\r\nadmissible  provided  the  court  thinks  that  no  pressure  or\r\n\r\ninducement has been applied.  I will illustrate this when I come\r\n\r\nto the case that I have in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another section of the Criminal Procedure Code which\r\n\r\nrequires  the police to notify a person when they have  made  up\r\n\r\ntheir  mind to charge him, to read the charge to him and to  ask\r\n\r\nhim what he has to say in reply to the charge.  The intention of\r\n\r\nthe legislature was that this should be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndone  the moment the police make up their mind to charge anyone.\r\n\r\nOf course, it must follow that if the police arrests anyone they\r\n\r\nmust  have  made up their mind to charge that person.   But  the\r\n\r\nsection  is  more honoured in the breach than in its observance.\r\n\r\nThe  man is not informed of his offence until maybe two or three\r\n\r\ndays  later  when  he  is  charged under  section  122(6)  which\r\n\r\nrequires  the  police  to  serve  the  notice  and  record   his\r\n\r\nstatement.  So while we have these laws, the question is how far\r\n\r\nare   they  observed  by  the  police  in  carrying  out   their\r\n\r\ninvestigations into crimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I should turn to this case that I said that I would refer to\r\n\r\nwhich  illustrates more than anything else what I have attempted\r\n\r\nto say.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the morning of 2nd February 1989, a\r\n\r\ncaretaker  was found murdered in a coffeeshop.  The police  were\r\n\r\ncalled  in  when the body was discovered.  Their first  line  of\r\n\r\ninquiry, as I have said, was about drug addicts who lived in the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood and who might have been seen near the shop  before\r\n\r\nthe   date  of  the  murder.   So  a  number  of  suspects  were\r\n\r\nquestioned.  May I say in passing that this is one of the things\r\n\r\nthat  perhaps makes drug addicts who have tried to come  out  of\r\n\r\ntheir  addiction  feel that society would  never  forgive  them,\r\n\r\nwould  not forget them, and they are the first targets  for  any\r\n\r\noffence suspected by the police.  So the police arrested one man\r\n\r\nabout  10  days later  and may I say, at the outset, that  there\r\n\r\nwas  no  question  that these men, who were eventually  charged,\r\n\r\nwere  totally  innocent. They were not even  anywhere  near  the\r\n\r\nscene of crime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police arrested this man and after a whole day of\r\n\r\nquestioning, he decided to, in his own words, admit to what  the\r\n\r\npolice  wanted him to admit because \"he could not  take  it  any\r\n\r\nmore.\"   I am not going to go through the treatment accorded  to\r\n\r\neveryone.   I will go through the treatment accorded to  one  of\r\n\r\nthem.  So towards the evening he decided he could not take it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nanymore and owned up to a minimal involvement of himself in  the\r\n\r\noffence  of  murder, claiming that he was really outside  whilst\r\n\r\nothers  went in.  Of course, once he admitted to an involvement,\r\n\r\nhe  had  to  name  others,  and he gave  the  nicknames  of  two\r\n\r\nbrothers.   The two brothers were then later picked up  in  turn\r\n\r\nand  they, after several hours of questioning under pain,  again\r\n\r\ndecided that they should go along with the police and admit what\r\n\r\nthe police were asking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the fourth man was arrested. On 18th February 1989, he\r\n\r\nwas picked up at 6.00 am.  His evidence given at the trial is  a\r\n\r\nstory  that  many may ask, \"How could this happen in Singapore?\"\r\n\r\nBut  he says it did happen to him.  He was picked up before 6.00\r\n\r\nam  and taken straight to the CID without even being allowed  to\r\n\r\nhave  a drink of water or to do his morning ablutions.  Then  he\r\n\r\nwas  taken  into the Inspector's room, the officer  who  was  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of investigations, and he was handcuffed to a chair  and\r\n\r\nlater  stripped to his underpants.  All along he was  not  given\r\n\r\nanything  to  eat or drink, he said.  They kept telling  him  to\r\n\r\nadmit  that he had been involved in the murder of the  caretaker\r\n\r\nat  the  coffeeshop.  He kept denying, saying he  did  not  know\r\n\r\nanything about it.  Then at 2.00 o'clock, he told the court that\r\n\r\nthe police officers who were questioning him decided they had to\r\n\r\nbe  more drastic and they made him stand on a chair stripped, as\r\n\r\nI  said,  to his underpants, and facing the air-conditioner  and\r\n\r\nbalancing  two  to three telephone directories  on  outstretched\r\n\r\narms.  May I repeat, he had not been given anything to drink  or\r\n\r\neat from the time of his arrest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This went on, Mr Speaker, Sir, according to his evidence in\r\n\r\ncourt,  till 6.00 am the next morning.  That is almost 24  hours\r\n\r\nafter  he  was picked up.  All during the 24 hours, his evidence\r\n\r\nwas  that  the  officers were sitting there,  tapping  him  with\r\n\r\nrulers,  assaulting him and saying, \"So you are going  to  be  a\r\n\r\nhero,  let's see how long you are going to last.\"  He said  that\r\n\r\nwhen  it came to day break, he could not stand any more of this.\r\n\r\nIn  his  own words, he told the court, \"I had no food.  I  could\r\n\r\nfeel  the  chill to my bones, Sir.  I felt as if I was about  to\r\n\r\nfall unconscious or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neven to die.\"  So he decided that there was nothing he could do,\r\n\r\nexcept to admit to some involvement.  So he was kept in custody,\r\n\r\nproduced in court, and remanded further in police custody  until\r\n\r\nfurther  investigations were completed.  And  that,  of  course,\r\n\r\nmeant taking more and more statements from these four persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not allowed any consultation with the lawyer until about\r\n\r\ntwo  or  three weeks later.  And even then, when the lawyer  was\r\n\r\nallowed to see him, the investigating officer sat by the side of\r\n\r\nthe  lawyer  and the accused was right in front of him  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, the accused could not say anything.  He said he was much\r\n\r\ntoo  frightened.  He was not allowed any family visits until 8th\r\n\r\nMarch.   These  men  were  held in  police  custody,  for  weeks\r\n\r\nremanded,  every  time they were produced in court  until  about\r\n\r\n27th March, and during this time the Police built up their case.\r\n\r\nAs  the  men said, they had to lie, and so they made up stories.\r\n\r\nThey made up stories about having thrown the man's wallet or the\r\n\r\nscrew  driver which was used in the offence.  But none of  these\r\n\r\nwas found, even when the Police went looking for these.  So they\r\n\r\nfound  no corroborative evidence.  The Police then decided  that\r\n\r\nthey had to get some evidence against these men and they decided\r\n\r\nto  reduce the charge against one man to house-breaking and  get\r\n\r\nhim to give evidence against the other three.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they were remanded at Queenstown Remand Prison on 27th\r\n\r\nMarch,  almost six weeks after they were picked up, the  lawyers\r\n\r\nfor  one  of  them  wrote  to the investigating  officer  giving\r\n\r\ninformation  that  his client had been told by  a  man  who  was\r\n\r\nserving  a  prison term in Changi (the name was mentioned)  that\r\n\r\nsomebody, other than the four, had committed the murder and  who\r\n\r\nhad  admitted  to it.  This letter was sent to the investigating\r\n\r\nofficer by the lawyers but the lawyers never got any reply  from\r\n\r\nthe  investigating  officer.  In court, he  said,  yes,  he  did\r\n\r\nreceive  the letter but it was not in his file.  He  thought  he\r\n\r\nhad mislaid it.  And when he was asked whether he followed up on\r\n\r\nthat information, he said, \"I tried to follow it up, but nothing\r\n\r\nwas forthcoming.  And so I left it.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that the Police were\r\n\r\nunable  to find any evidence at all from any source outside  the\r\n\r\nstatements  alleged to have been made by these four men.   There\r\n\r\nwas  no corroborative evidence of one single fact.  All that the\r\n\r\nPolice  had were these alleged statements of these four  persons\r\n\r\nrelating, according to the Police, their involvement.  The men's\r\n\r\nexplanation  was  they went along with the  Police  because  the\r\n\r\nPolice  told  them, \"This is how it should have been  done,  you\r\n\r\nknow.  We know you must have got this, you must have done that.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so they said they went along with whatever the Police said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were fingerprints found at the scene but none of the\r\n\r\nfingerprints of any of the four matched any fingerprint found at\r\n\r\nthe scene.  There was blood found but again none of the blood of\r\n\r\nthe  four matched the blood grouping of the blood that was found\r\n\r\nat  the  scene.  So, as I said, there was nothing against  these\r\n\r\nmen, except their so-called confessions.  At the trial, the  man\r\n\r\nwho had done a deal with the Police gave evidence, saying how he\r\n\r\nwas  just outside while the three others went in and he saw them\r\n\r\nall  come out through the open door at the front.  But in cross-examination,  he  told  the court, \"I only  admitted  because  I\r\n\r\ncouldn't  take  it any more.  I decided that I  should  just  go\r\n\r\nalong   with   what  the  Police  were  asking   me   to   say.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  his  evidence was accepted  and  the  court  also\r\n\r\nadmitted  the statement from one accused.  And this is important\r\n\r\n-   the  court  admitted  the  statement  as  having  been  made\r\n\r\nvoluntarily because that was what the Police evidence was.  They\r\n\r\nwent  into the witness box - Police officer after Police officer\r\n\r\nand  swore that there was nothing unusual in what they did, that\r\n\r\nthe  men voluntarily made the statements.  And so the court left\r\n\r\nwith that evidence admitted - the statement of one of these  men\r\n\r\nwho  implicated the others and also the statement of  one  other\r\n\r\naccused person.  At the end of the prosecution case, two of them\r\n\r\nwere called to enter their defence to a charge of murder.  May I\r\n\r\nrepeat  - to a murder that they had never committed.  Because  I\r\n\r\nshall show that it was proved conclusively that they could never\r\n\r\nhave committed that murder.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was during the conduct of the defence that the defence\r\n\r\ninsisted  on calling the man of whom information had been  given\r\n\r\nthat  he  had committed the murder.  He was called  and  he,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  denied it.  But the defence also called the man serving\r\n\r\nsentence  in  Changi Prison and he told the court that  the  man\r\n\r\nagainst  whom  information had been  given  had  admitted  at  a\r\n\r\ngathering  that he was the man who had gone into  the  shop  and\r\n\r\nthen  committed the murder.  The defence then gave  notice  that\r\n\r\nthey  would recall the fingerprint examiner, to ask whether  the\r\n\r\nfingerprint of the man against whom information had  been  given\r\n\r\nhad  been matched with the fingerprint found at the scene.   The\r\n\r\nDPP  then  directed the fingerprint examiner to do a comparison.\r\n\r\nAnd  when  the fingerprint examiner gave evidence, he came  with\r\n\r\nthe  news which confirmed what the defence had been saying, that\r\n\r\na  fingerprint found at the scene matched the fingerprint of the\r\n\r\nman against whom information had been given by the defence.  And\r\n\r\nso  the next day, the DPP withdrew the charges against all three\r\n\r\nmen.  That was an admission, Mr Speaker, Sir, that they were the\r\n\r\nwrong  men.   They were completely the wrong men  but  they  had\r\n\r\nspent 39 months in prison before they could be acquitted on  the\r\n\r\nmurder  that  they  had never committed.   There  were  so  many\r\n\r\nfactors  which  militated  against  them  having  committed  the\r\n\r\noffence but the Investigation Officer decided that once  he  had\r\n\r\ngot the confessions, that was it.  There was no need to look  at\r\n\r\nanything more.  There is one compelling factor and that was  the\r\n\r\ndoor, the opened door, they said they had come out through.  But\r\n\r\nevidence  was given that the door could not be shut and  secured\r\n\r\nfrom  outside and the morning when the body was discovered,  the\r\n\r\ndoors  were  all  found secured from inside.  So  how  did  that\r\n\r\nhappen?  The inspector would appear to have been not interested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the acquittal of these men, the Police then finally\r\n\r\ncharged the man against whom information was given.  And he  was\r\n\r\nsubsequently  tried  in another court and  he  admitted  in  his\r\n\r\nevidence that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhe  alone had entered the shop.  There was somebody else outside\r\n\r\nbut  not any one of these four men who had been earlier charged.\r\n\r\nAnd  he was found guilty of murder and convicted.  So we had  it\r\n\r\nproved  conclusively without any shadow of doubt that these  men\r\n\r\nwere completely innocent of the charge of murder.  And yet as  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  the Police proceeded with the prosecution simply  because\r\n\r\nthey  had,  in their own words, \"got the confessions from  these\r\n\r\nmen\", and that was it, there is nothing more to be said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the acquittal, the men brought an action for damages in\r\n\r\nthe High Court for malicious prosecution.  This was dismissed by\r\n\r\nthe  Judicial Commissioner who held that the Police officer  had\r\n\r\nreasonable grounds at that time for believing that these men had\r\n\r\ncommitted the crime.  He avoided answering the question  whether\r\n\r\nthe  confessions were free and voluntarily made.   He  was  told\r\n\r\nthat  there were only three explanations possible.  One was that\r\n\r\nthe  men  were extroverts who suddenly decided they wanted  some\r\n\r\npublicity,  to  be  charged with murder, and that  is  why  they\r\n\r\nconfessed.   Secondly, that their minds were  so  deranged  that\r\n\r\nthey  saw  in their minds them committing the murder.   And  the\r\n\r\nthird  explanation,  of course, was that  the  confessions  were\r\n\r\nforced  out  of  them.  The Judicial Commissioner  unfortunately\r\n\r\nfailed to deal with this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry if I have taken so long, but this case\r\n\r\nillustrates  so  vividly, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the  total  lack  of\r\n\r\nprotection that our citizens, and I repeat again, the weak,  the\r\n\r\nilliterate, uneducated citizens, have against Police action.  We\r\n\r\nhave to ensure that our people are protected against the Police,\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  not unnecessarily made to suffer for  something\r\n\r\nwhich  they did not do.  It is not just this case of these  four\r\n\r\nmen, glaring as it is, but there are other instances, and one of\r\n\r\nthem  has  been  mentioned earlier.  There was the educationally\r\n\r\nsubnormal  boy of 12 who was picked up just because  the  Police\r\n\r\nthought  he  was  riding a stolen bicycle and he was  questioned\r\n\r\nwithout any of his parents being present or called and, when  he\r\n\r\nleft, there were marks of violence found on him.  There was  yet\r\n\r\nanother case of some foreign workers who were charged with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrobbery.  Again, there was no evidence, apart from their alleged\r\n\r\nconfessions,  but, fortunately, the DPP could see  that  and  he\r\n\r\ndecided  to withdraw the charges, but again, after the  men  had\r\n\r\nspent about four to six weeks in custody.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was puzzled by a statement made by a CID official commenting\r\n\r\non  the report that a statement made to the Singapore Police  by\r\n\r\nan  SIA steward was held inadmissible by an American court.   It\r\n\r\nrefused  to  admit that statement, saying it had not  been  made\r\n\r\nunder,  what  the Americans call, the due process of  law.   But\r\n\r\nwhat  puzzled me was the statement by the CID official that  was\r\n\r\nreported in the papers, and he said, \"We have no vested interest\r\n\r\nin  this case.  This case happened in the United States.  So why\r\n\r\nshould we force any man to confess?\"  The Party queried this and\r\n\r\nasked whether it was a Freudian slip, whether the CID was saying\r\n\r\nbecause  it  was an offence committed in America,  they  had  no\r\n\r\nvested  interest, but they would have had a vested  interest  if\r\n\r\nthe offence had been committed in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is time, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do say it quite\r\n\r\nseriously, that we should examine the whole question of criminal\r\n\r\njustice  in Singapore to see whether we have now gone overboard,\r\n\r\ntoo  far, in our eagerness to show how good the Singapore Police\r\n\r\nare  in combating crime so that we have good statistical figures\r\n\r\nto publish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a debate, Mr Speaker, Sir, in this House, in 1995 and,\r\n\r\nof  course, I was not here then.  There was this question  about\r\n\r\nhow   the   Police   went   about  investigating   crime.    The\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary, speaking in that debate, told the House\r\n\r\nthat between the years 1993 and April 1995, 166 cases were tried\r\n\r\nin  the  High Court at which statements made to the Police  were\r\n\r\ntendered as evidence against the accused persons, and he went on\r\n\r\nto  say  that  only  in four, the courts refused  to  admit  the\r\n\r\nstatements  and  that,  for the rest, the  statements  were  all\r\n\r\nadmitted.   As  I said, at this trial that I have  referred  to,\r\n\r\nstatements  were  admitted.   And,  yet,  we  know  that   those\r\n\r\nstatements were all lies told by innocent men who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwere  desperate,  anxious to escape from  the  clutches  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice.   So  the question we have to ask is: do  our  laws  now\r\n\r\nprotect our citizens from resorting to lies in the hands of  the\r\n\r\nPolice  only to escape from Police custody?  Do our laws  ensure\r\n\r\nthat   the   Police  observe  the  law  in  carrying   out   the\r\n\r\ninvestigations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I again refer to this report of the United Kingdom Law\r\n\r\nCommission on Justice.  Even before 1993, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\npractice  in  the  United Kingdom was for all statements  to  be\r\n\r\naudio  taped.   The  Police  had to audio  tape  all  statements\r\n\r\nrecorded from suspects.  But the Commission recommended that  it\r\n\r\nwas  not just audio taping but they wanted a video recording  of\r\n\r\nall   detention  centres  where  suspects  were   detained   for\r\n\r\nquestioning, and they also referred to the right of the  suspect\r\n\r\nto  consult  his  lawyer before he made  any  statement  to  the\r\n\r\nPolice.  And this is now the law in England under section 58  of\r\n\r\nthe  Criminal  Evidence Act, 1984, which  assures  all  arrested\r\n\r\npersons the right to legal advice, free of charge, regardless of\r\n\r\ntheir  means.  And what is more important, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nsection goes on to say that if the suspect does not wish to seek\r\n\r\nlegal advice, the Police had to get that in writing from him  so\r\n\r\nthat it can be produced in court that he refused legal advice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present laws in Singapore relating to admissibility of\r\n\r\nstatements  in the Criminal Procedure Code allow the prosecution\r\n\r\nto  tender statements made to any police officer above the  rank\r\n\r\nof  Sergeant and for it to be disallowed only if it  appears  to\r\n\r\nthe court that the statements were obtained under inducement  or\r\n\r\nthreat.   But  as  can be seen from the figures  quoted  by  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary then in the debate in 1995,  the  courts\r\n\r\nadmit  almost all the statements.  The courts find it  difficult\r\n\r\nto believe that police officers would resort to the conduct that\r\n\r\nthese men say they were subjected to.  And the unfortunate  part\r\n\r\nof  it  is that the man who is in custody has no way of  proving\r\n\r\nhis case apart from giving evidence himself.  He cannot call any\r\n\r\nwitnesses.  He has not got anybody who will advise him,  whereas\r\n\r\nthe Police of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncourse have all the officers parading into the court and saying,\r\n\r\n\"Oh,  no.  We never touched him.  It is all voluntary.  He acted\r\n\r\nof  his own accord in giving the statement.\"  I think it is time\r\n\r\nthat  we looked at these sections in the Criminal Procedure Code\r\n\r\nand see whether, as I said earlier, we have not gone too far  in\r\n\r\nour eagerness to stamp out crime as it were.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, other laws that perhaps we should look at.\r\n\r\nThere are the sections in the Evidence Act and other sections in\r\n\r\nthe  CPC.  There is one section in the Evidence Act, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  that perhaps we should look at very seriously and that  is\r\n\r\nthe section which allows the courts to act on the statement of a\r\n\r\nco-accused without any corroboration of his evidence.   The  law\r\n\r\nat one time was that that section meant that the courts may look\r\n\r\nat  statements made by the co-accused.  But the courts must find\r\n\r\ncorroborative evidence of the statement made by the  co-accused.\r\n\r\nThat  law  was changed by a ruling of the Court of  Appeal  some\r\n\r\ntime  ago  and now the courts are free to convict on  statements\r\n\r\nmade   by   the  co-accused  person  even  when  there   is   no\r\n\r\ncorroboration whatsoever of his statement made to the Police.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have said enough, Mr Speaker, Sir. It is important\r\n\r\nthat  we should ensure in our society, if we are concerned about\r\n\r\njustice,  that justice is something that matters.  We should  do\r\n\r\nsomething  to see, as in other countries, that innocent  persons\r\n\r\nare  in  no danger of being convicted wrongly.  I am not  asking\r\n\r\nthis  House to make any finding on this, but my motion is simply\r\n\r\nthat  we  should now appoint a Commission, as they  did  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited   Kingdom,  to  look  at  the  whole  state  of  criminal\r\n\r\ninvestigation in this country.  May I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that\r\n\r\nmy  fears are not just my own.  A number of lawyers who practise\r\n\r\nat the criminal bar have voiced these fears.  There used to be a\r\n\r\nrule, it is still the rule, that an accused person is deemed  to\r\n\r\nbe  innocent  until he is proved guilty.  But some  lawyers  now\r\n\r\nfeel  that that is being eroded.  There is a view that a person,\r\n\r\nonce he is charged by the Police, must be guilty, otherwise the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPolice  would not charge him.  That is a dangerous view to  take\r\n\r\nand we have got to put an end to that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move that this House seriously consider this\r\n\r\nmotion  and  appoint  a Commission of Inquiry  to  inquire  into\r\n\r\ncriminal justice in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam,  in  moving  this  motion  and  in  calling  for   a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry into the investigation of crimes  and  the\r\n\r\nlaws  relating  to criminal evidence and procedure,  has  raised\r\n\r\nvery  grave  allegations that our laws and officers of  the  law\r\n\r\nhave  somehow  not  provided  adequate  protection  for  accused\r\n\r\npersons  and,  more  seriously,  that  the  innocent  may   have\r\n\r\ntherefore  been  unjustly punished.  As I do not  have  personal\r\n\r\nknowledge of the cases that he referred to, I shall not speak on\r\n\r\nthose cases, but I should like to address the issue whether  the\r\n\r\nlaw  relating  to criminal procedure and evidence do  adequately\r\n\r\nprotect accused persons from the risk of wrongful conviction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House should roundly and unequivocally reject such\r\n\r\nallegations,  because if these allegations are unrebutted,  they\r\n\r\nwould  adversely affect public opinion of our administration  of\r\n\r\ncriminal  justice.   That would be most damaging  to  our  legal\r\n\r\nsystem,  a  legal system that has won the respect of  many  both\r\n\r\ninside and outside of Singapore, one that is fair, efficient and\r\n\r\njust.  So such assertions cannot be allowed to go unchallenged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Mr Jeyaretnam is aware that the general\r\n\r\nprinciples of our criminal evidence were derived from the common\r\n\r\nlaw  that still applies to Singapore.  Our system provides rules\r\n\r\nand  as  much as other legal systems based on the Anglo-American\r\n\r\nsystems.  Our Evidence Act, for example, was enacted more than a\r\n\r\ncentury ago in 1893.  The rules were based on the English common\r\n\r\nlaw,  codified  for us for the first time in  India;  later,  in\r\n\r\nother  jurisdictions  such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan,  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nFederation and, of course, Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are sound fundamental principles embodied in these rules.\r\n\r\nWhat are they?  The first is the so-called golden thread of  the\r\n\r\ncommon  law.  The prosecution, in general, shoulders the  burden\r\n\r\nof  proof,  to prove that the accused is liable for the  offence\r\n\r\nwith  which  he  is charged.  The standard of  proof  is  beyond\r\n\r\nreasonable   doubt.   This  is  the  so-called  presumption   of\r\n\r\ninnocence.  It is alive and well in Singapore.  The accused will\r\n\r\ntherefore be entitled to call the prosecution to prove the  case\r\n\r\nagainst  him,   and  this  remains  the  fundamental  principle.\r\n\r\nApplying  that principle and on matters which Mr Jeyaretnam  has\r\n\r\nreferred  to  in relation to the statements out  of  court,  the\r\n\r\naccused  person's  statements are  not  admissible,  as  he  had\r\n\r\nmentioned  just now, if they were obtained through  the  use  of\r\n\r\ninducements,  threats or promises made by persons in  authority.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  involuntary  statements  or  confessions  are\r\n\r\ninadmissible in evidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the facts that he had described just now of a case that\r\n\r\nactually resulted in an acquittal, he would know, I think,  that\r\n\r\nsuch statements may be challenged in court, and that the accused\r\n\r\ncan give evidence in voir dire to show that such confessions are\r\n\r\nunlawfully obtained.  Indeed, in our courts, they have  extended\r\n\r\nthe  law  beyond that which Mr Jeyaretnam has referred  to.   In\r\n\r\nother  words,  they  have  extended the law  beyond  involuntary\r\n\r\nstatements, to include what in common law is called the doctrine\r\n\r\nof  oppression.   This is a doctrine which is familiar  both  in\r\n\r\nEngland,  the  United  States,  Malaysia   and  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\ndoctrine  of oppression does not require any inducement,  threat\r\n\r\nor  promise  if  the  accused, for any reason,  gave  statements\r\n\r\nobtained through the use of oppressive conduct by the persons in\r\n\r\nauthority, such statements are inadmissible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our courts, we have had instances where statements have been\r\n\r\nrejected  by reasons of either inducement, threat or promise  or\r\n\r\nby reason of oppressive conduct.  So the courts are aware of the\r\n\r\npossibility that statements may have been involuntarily obtained\r\n\r\nand  these laws provide protection for any accused person coming\r\n\r\nbefore the courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the other principles that Mr Jeyaretnam perhaps has not\r\n\r\nmentioned?  We can refer to the principle that the accused's own\r\n\r\nbad  reputation  or disposition to crime, for  example,  is  not\r\n\r\nadmissible  evidence against him, unless he somehow  lowers  his\r\n\r\nshield, attacks the character of prosecution witnesses intending\r\n\r\nto  discredit  them.  Under our existing law,  for  example,  an\r\n\r\naccused charged for rape or molestation would be able to  attack\r\n\r\nthe  character of the victim freely without fear  that  his  own\r\n\r\ndiscreditable record may be introduced in evidence.   These  are\r\n\r\nthe  checks which are put into our Evidence Act and they  remain\r\n\r\nlaws to this day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, one overriding principle that we have in our courts\r\n\r\ntoday  is  that the judges have a discretion to exclude evidence\r\n\r\nthat  is  unduly prejudicial to the accused.   This has  been  a\r\n\r\ndiscretion  that  is expressly recognised by a Court  of  Appeal\r\n\r\ndecision  in  Singapore and indeed in that particular  decision,\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Justice took pains to point out that he rejected  the\r\n\r\nargument  by a dissenting Judge that the Evidence Act  does  not\r\n\r\nprovide for such a discretion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these principles remain in operation in our laws. They are\r\n\r\nguarantees to the quality of evidence that the prosecution  must\r\n\r\nprovide  in  order  to secure a conviction.  In  evolving  these\r\n\r\nrules,  it must not be forgotten that the State also has a  very\r\n\r\nreal  interest in protecting the interest of the general  public\r\n\r\nin ensuring that victims of crimes are indeed protected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the purpose of having a Commission of Inquiry to look\r\n\r\ninto  the rules of evidence and procedure that have been debated\r\n\r\nin  this House, the latest of which was in 1976, when amendments\r\n\r\nwere  made  to  the Evidence Act and to the  Criminal  Procedure\r\n\r\nCode  following the recommendations actually of another  English\r\n\r\nEvidence  Committee,  ie, the 11th Report of  the  Committee  on\r\n\r\nCriminal Evidence?  Singapore introduced those provisions and by\r\n\r\nintroducing  those provisions had actually done  away  with  the\r\n\r\nJudge's rules which Mr Jeyaretnam is so fond of.  But in  having\r\n\r\ntaken out the Judge's rules, they have also put in place\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovisions  concerning the taking of statements.  I  believe  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  is, as he has criminal practice, familiar  with  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  section  122(6), (7) and  (8)  of  the  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure  Code.  All these are rules of evidence  and  criminal\r\n\r\nprocedure  that  are  debated.  There is no  need  to  have  any\r\n\r\nCommission  of  Inquiry to decide whether such rules  take  into\r\n\r\naccount the interest of accused persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no reason for appointing a\r\n\r\nCommission  of  Inquiry,  as suggested  by  Mr  Jeyaretnam.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, I do not mean to say here that our laws of evidence  and\r\n\r\nprocedure should not be revised from time to time, to keep  them\r\n\r\nrelevant  in the light of changing circumstances.   It  must  be\r\n\r\nremembered  that our Evidence Act, for example,  is  enacted  in\r\n\r\n1893.  It is over a hundred years old.  It is beginning to  show\r\n\r\nsome   signs   of   not  being  able  to  cope   with   changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  But there is no reason why the normal procedures\r\n\r\nin  Parliament would not be able to take care of any issues that\r\n\r\nmay arise in such reform.  Therefore, Sir, we should reject this\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam once\r\n\r\nagain  raises  an old issue.  We have debated these  matters  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  many  times  before about alleged  police  assault,\r\n\r\nalleged police impropriety, especially in the last term when  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  was not in the House.  And we did not  debate  these\r\n\r\nmatters in vacuo.  Many MPs, including Opposition MPs such as Mr\r\n\r\nLow Thia Khiang, Mr Cheo Chai Chen and NMPs such as Assoc. Prof.\r\n\r\nWalter   Woon  and  Dr  Kanwaljit  Soin  asked  many   searching\r\n\r\nquestions, both general and on specific cases.  And to all these\r\n\r\nqueries,  the  Government gave full and  detailed  explanations.\r\n\r\nAll these are in the Hansard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Wong Kan Seng, also gave a\r\n\r\ndetailed account of how our criminal justice\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsystem  operates, highlighting its safeguards, when this  House,\r\n\r\nafter a full debate in May 1995, passed a motion reaffirming the\r\n\r\nHouse's  confidence  in  Singapore's  criminal  justice  system,\r\n\r\nespecially the integrity of our Judges in upholding the rule  of\r\n\r\nlaw and the competence of the Police in enforcing law and order.\r\n\r\nIf  I  am not wrong, Mr Low who was in this House at that  time,\r\n\r\nvoted in favour of the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why then is the Workers' Party's Secretary-General raising\r\n\r\nthis  motion  today?   Quite true to  form,  Mr  Jeyaretnam  has\r\n\r\nstrayed in his speech.  Let us just focus on the main points  of\r\n\r\ntoday's motion.  Mr Jeyaretnam has told a long story, but really\r\n\r\nthe heart of the matter is that Mr Jeyaretnam wants a Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry (COI) to look into police investigation methods  and\r\n\r\nhe  has  also mentioned some legal provisions and procedures  to\r\n\r\nsee  if  they  adequately protect innocent persons.   But,  Sir,\r\n\r\nreally the first question this House must ask is: on what  basis\r\n\r\ndoes  he ask for a Commission of Inquiry?  Has he or anyone else\r\n\r\nuncovered  gross miscarriages of justice necessitating  such  an\r\n\r\ninquiry?   Or  indeed blatant abuse of police powers  or  forced\r\n\r\nconfessions  or  other ill treatment of accused persons?   Well,\r\n\r\nthe  answer is no.  Quite predictably, he mentioned the case  of\r\n\r\nZainal Bin Kuning and others which he represented and which,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  in  the past, he had already raised in this  House  in  a\r\n\r\nprevious  debate last year, when I responded to him  during  the\r\n\r\nCommittee of Supply debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have looked at the reports and all the papers. First, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  Mr Jeyaretnam tells his side of the story, as recounted\r\n\r\nto him no doubt by his client about police assault.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It was given in evidence in court.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, if you wish to interject,\r\n\r\ncould you please rise and seek my permission?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am sorry, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. Prof. Ho.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The point of the matter is that\r\n\r\nthere  was a suit taken by Mr Zainal in that case where  he  was\r\n\r\nrepresented,  if  I  am  not wrong, by the  NCMP  for  malicious\r\n\r\nprosecution and forced imprisonment.  But the High Court\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nJudge in that case, after a full trial, said that looking at the\r\n\r\nevidence  before  him,  he  found  that  there  was  no   forced\r\n\r\nconfession.  The confession was voluntary.  He looked  at  other\r\n\r\nevidence.   He looked at the evidence of the medical doctor  who\r\n\r\nexamined  the accused person in accordance with the  requirement\r\n\r\nof  the  law and also the evidence of the interpreter.   Indeed,\r\n\r\nthe  Court of Appeal, when it went on appeal, said that it found\r\n\r\nno  grounds  to interfere with the findings of the  High  Court.\r\n\r\nThere, we have it, Sir, full-fledged cases which have determined\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, Mr Jeyaretnam says, \"Well, the DPP, when it\r\n\r\ndropped the charges, said that the parties were innocent.\"  What\r\n\r\nhappened  in  that case is, quite rightly, as Mr Jeyaretnam  has\r\n\r\nmentioned, fresh evidence surfaced, evidence as to fingerprints,\r\n\r\nalibi  evidence, which had been disclosed before in a letter  to\r\n\r\nthe investigation officer.  Mr Jeyaretnam is correct in that the\r\n\r\nofficer  had  not exercised enough diligence in  pursuing  those\r\n\r\nleads and indeed the officer has been disciplined for that.  But\r\n\r\nthe  point is that there was no cover-up and no intention on the\r\n\r\npart  of  the  police to deliberately frame anybody or  suppress\r\n\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Public Prosecutor preferred the charges against the\r\n\r\nthree  original  accused,  there was  evidence  given  by  their\r\n\r\naccomplice,  who had testified that they were the ones  who  had\r\n\r\ncommitted the robbery and the murder.  Of course, in the face of\r\n\r\nthe  fresh evidence, quite rightly the police in that case  said\r\n\r\nthat  they would go under section 193 of the CPC where it  asked\r\n\r\nfor  the  court's  indulgence that it did not  wish  to  further\r\n\r\nprosecute  the accused under the charge.  That section  provides\r\n\r\nthat the accused person shall be given a discharge not amounting\r\n\r\nto  an  acquittal,  unless  of course  the  presiding  judge  so\r\n\r\ndecides.   In  that  case, I think Mr Jeyaretnam  protested  and\r\n\r\nasked  for  an acquittal and the court granted his  client  that\r\n\r\nacquittal. That is the background.  I think we have to see  this\r\n\r\nin  totality.  It is not a case of police wrongdoing.  There may\r\n\r\nhave been some areas in its investigations which could have been\r\n\r\nmore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndiligently  pursued.  But on the facts before it,  the  DPP  had\r\n\r\nevery reason to prefer the charges and to do what it did.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that the police is open enough, the DPP\r\n\r\nis  open enough, should there be evidence to suggest that  there\r\n\r\nis  some  doubt.  Do not forget that at the end of the day,  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's  Chambers  has  to  prove  its  case   beyond\r\n\r\nreasonable doubt, which is a high standard of proof.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nshould  there  be  evidence,  the totality  of  which  makes  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  succeed in proving its case,  according  to  this\r\n\r\nstandard,  it  could  very well be, as it happened  in  Zainal's\r\n\r\ncase, where the DPP says, \"Well, we will go under section 193.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at that time, Mr Jeyaretnam had called for a Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry to be formed in 1992.  Now, six years later, out  of\r\n\r\nthe  blue, he calls for a Commission of Inquiry.  But he forgets\r\n\r\nthat,  in  the meantime, in these six years - in fact, the  case\r\n\r\ntook  place  in 1989, which is almost 10 years ago - there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  many  improvements to our criminal  justice  system.   The\r\n\r\ncourt  system,  for one thing, there is no backlog.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  long  remand period that the accused persons in  that  case\r\n\r\nwere  subject  to was quite unfortunate, but he knows  that  the\r\n\r\ncourts have become more efficient.  We have also introduced laws\r\n\r\nto  make  sure that the cases go more expeditiously.  I am  told\r\n\r\nthat  for High Court criminal cases now, it would not take  more\r\n\r\nthan  five  to six months before a person is tried  after  being\r\n\r\nfirst charged in court.  There have been other improvements such\r\n\r\nas pre-trial conferences, police team investigation systems, and\r\n\r\nso forth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam cites the Runciman Commission of Inquiry in\r\n\r\nthe UK which, of course, came in the light of public outcry over\r\n\r\na  few  high  profile cases, \"Guildford 4\", \"Birmingham  6\"  and\r\n\r\nother  like  cases, where innocent parties were put into  prison\r\n\r\nfor many, many years, I think more than 10 years. As a result of\r\n\r\nexternal  investigations, it was found out that  police  had  in\r\n\r\nfact  used  tainted evidence and there were other improprieties.\r\n\r\nThen  the Commission came about which, of course, gave  rise  to\r\n\r\ncertain recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBut the question really is this: does this situation pertain  in\r\n\r\nSingapore today?  Mr Jeyaretnam likes to pluck examples from the\r\n\r\nUK  without really examining whether they are applicable in  the\r\n\r\nlocal  context.  He talks about the Runciman Commission  and  he\r\n\r\ntalks about video taping and other examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just say that in other countries, including the UK,\r\n\r\nthere  is  concern that the balance is now tilted  too  much  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of accused persons, resulting in miscarriages of justice\r\n\r\nwhere guilty parties are escaping the clutches of the law.   All\r\n\r\nover  the  world, criminals, including those in Singapore,  have\r\n\r\nbecome more intelligent. What we need really is not to shift the\r\n\r\nbalance,  as  it  applies today, more in  their  favour,  as  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  suggests, because then we are doing a disservice  to\r\n\r\nthe  preponderant majority of innocent Singaporeans who  deserve\r\n\r\nour every protection. Let us not do as Mr Jeyaretnam urges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. When the public prosecutor drops a\r\n\r\ncharge, it does not necessarily mean that the accused person  is\r\n\r\ninnocent.   Indeed, if the court finds that the charge  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  made  out, it does not  necessarily mean that the  accused\r\n\r\nperson  is  innocent. What it means is that the prosecution  has\r\n\r\nfailed  to  discharge the high burden of proof beyond reasonable\r\n\r\ndoubt.   To  put  it  in another way, the  defence  has  cast  a\r\n\r\nreasonable doubt on the prosecution's case.  This point  was  in\r\n\r\nfact  covered by the Minister for Law in this House in  response\r\n\r\nto  Prof. Walter Woon that we should not get carried away.  Yes,\r\n\r\nthere are cases where the public prosecutor does not succeed  in\r\n\r\nproving  its case and therefore convicting the accused,  but  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean therefore that the charge should not  have  been\r\n\r\npreferred  in  the first place, because the AG's  Chambers  must\r\n\r\ndecide in the public interest what cases to prosecute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of Members, let me just recount what we\r\n\r\nalready  have in our system, where there are adequate safeguards\r\n\r\nto ensure that innocent people are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  convicted.  For example, the investigation process includes\r\n\r\na  comprehensive  system of checks and balances through  several\r\n\r\nlayers  of scrutiny and supervision.  Every day, at every police\r\n\r\ndivision,  a duty Senior Investigation Officer (SIO) checks  the\r\n\r\ncases  reported for the day to see how they are handled.   Every\r\n\r\nmorning,  the Chief Investigation Officer (CIO) will  check  all\r\n\r\npolice  reports lodged in the previous 24 hours and the  actions\r\n\r\ntaken to deal with them.  More difficult cases are reviewed in a\r\n\r\nMorning  Panel  chaired by the Commander or Head,  Investigation\r\n\r\n(HI).   Thereafter, the CIO and HI will continue to monitor  the\r\n\r\ncases that require further investigation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cases handled by the CID, which are the more serious and\r\n\r\ncomplex  cases,  this  process of close supervision  is  further\r\n\r\nenhanced   by   case   conferencing,  focusing   on   individual\r\n\r\ninvestigations.   CID  has also strengthened  its  investigative\r\n\r\ncapability by implementing team investigation. This team  system\r\n\r\nhas  also  been adopted by the Land Divisions, first by Clementi\r\n\r\nPolice  Division,  in  tandem  with  the  introduction  of   the\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood  Police Centres (NPCs).  Over time,  as  the  NPCs\r\n\r\nbecome   a   common   feature  in  our  Land   Divisions,   team\r\n\r\ninvestigation will become the norm.  For the more serious cases,\r\n\r\nthe AG's Chambers is consulted before a decision to prosecute is\r\n\r\nmade.   At  the AG's Chambers itself, a special Criminal  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee critically reviews and evaluates the evidence and  law\r\n\r\nin every pending High Court trial and appeal to determine if the\r\n\r\ncharges or appeal should be proceeded with in court.  These  are\r\n\r\njust illustrations I am giving.  But this approach permeates our\r\n\r\nsystem where there are counter checks and balances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam talks about the recording of suspect's\r\n\r\nstatements.  First, let me put things in perspective.  Suspect's\r\n\r\nstatements  are only a variety of evidence that the police  will\r\n\r\nusually  obtain  to  prove a case against  the  accused.   Other\r\n\r\nevidence  is  independently obtained through the testimonies  of\r\n\r\nother   witnesses,  identification  parade,  physical   evidence\r\n\r\nobtained at the scene of crime, and other exhibits seized by the\r\n\r\npolice\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich connect the arrested person to the offence.  So let us not\r\n\r\njust  look at confession statements and focus on that aspect  of\r\n\r\nthe evidence.  During the process of interview, the arrestee  is\r\n\r\nconfronted  with  these pieces of evidence  for  an  explanation\r\n\r\nwhich  is  then  considered  with other  corroborative  evidence\r\n\r\nbefore  a  decision  is  taken whether  or  not  to  charge  and\r\n\r\nprosecute him.  Sir, the interview process seeks to find out the\r\n\r\ntruth,  not  to extract a forced confession.  In any  case,  the\r\n\r\narrestee  has  to be produced in court within 48  hours  of  his\r\n\r\narrest and indeed the court has to make a ruling, and the police\r\n\r\nhas  to make out a case, as to whether or not the accused person\r\n\r\nshould  be  further  remanded.   So  let  us  leave  it  to  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion and powers of the court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in all High Court cases, an arrestee is\r\n\r\nexamined by a medical officer before and after the taking of his\r\n\r\nstatement.    Also,   anyone  who   is   assaulted   has   ample\r\n\r\nopportunities  to complain to a senior officer tasked  to  check\r\n\r\nthe police lock-ups routinely to record any complaint, or indeed\r\n\r\nsubsequently, to family members who may visit him.  In  fact,  a\r\n\r\nsuspect can request for a medical examination any time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say this: police has no reason to convict innocent\r\n\r\npeople.  Think about it.  It is not in the interest of the Force\r\n\r\nto  do this, as it would undermine the credibility, respect  and\r\n\r\nconfidence the Force enjoys in the eyes of the public.   If  the\r\n\r\nwrong  person is charged and convicted, what it really means  is\r\n\r\nthat the guilty party remains free and probably will commit more\r\n\r\ncrimes.   Police  therefore has no reason  whatsoever  to  force\r\n\r\nconfessions out of innocent people.  What is more important,  as\r\n\r\nI  have  assured  this House in the past,  MHA  and  top  police\r\n\r\nmanagement,  right  from the Commissioner of  Police  downwards,\r\n\r\nwill never condone such wrongdoing.  Quite the contrary, we take\r\n\r\na  tough  no-nonsense stance against black  sheep  officers  who\r\n\r\nabuse their powers or who are sloppy in their work.  Thankfully,\r\n\r\nSir, such officers are not many.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, complaints against police abuse of suspects dropped\r\n\r\nfrom 94 in 1994 to 56 last year.  These complaints were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvestigated  by the Service Development and Inspectorate  (SDI)\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  the  Police Force.  The 56 complaints  represent\r\n\r\nonly  a minuscule 0.2% of the 27,073 suspects arrested in  1997.\r\n\r\nOf   these,   only   10  cases  involving   14   officers   were\r\n\r\nsubstantiated.  Of course, the errant officers were dealt with - departmentally  or  prosecuted in court.  This  represents  less\r\n\r\nthan 0.12% of our police force totalling over 10,900 officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important safeguard against police abuses is our courts.\r\n\r\nThe  fact that there are acquittals by our courts shows that the\r\n\r\nsystem  is working.  Every investigator knows that any  evidence\r\n\r\nadduced  in court against the accused, and this point  has  been\r\n\r\nmentioned by Prof. Chin, including confession statements, can be\r\n\r\nchallenged and thrown out by the court.  Here again, the numbers\r\n\r\nare  very  small.  But the fact that our courts have thrown  out\r\n\r\nsuch  statements  shows  that  it  is  an  effective  safeguard.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  the  small  number shows that  police  takes  its  work\r\n\r\nseriously; police knows that its work will be scrutinised by the\r\n\r\ncourts, and that has resulted in the small numbers.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause,  as  Mr Jeyaretnam says, it is very difficult  for  the\r\n\r\ncourts to discover any wrongdoing.  Quite the contrary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, and Prof. Chin who specialises in evidence has mentioned\r\n\r\nthis  already,  the  law  ensures that  only  properly  obtained\r\n\r\nconfession evidence is admitted as evidence of guilt.  Under the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Procedure  Code and Evidence Act, a  confession  which\r\n\r\nappears  to  have  been obtained through  any  form  of  threat,\r\n\r\ninducement  or promise is not admissible as evidence  in  court.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, as I have mentioned just now, the law places  on\r\n\r\nthe  prosecution the burden of proving beyond reasonable  doubt,\r\n\r\nnot just the overall case, but also that the confession was made\r\n\r\nvoluntarily.  Therefore, again, a high burden of proof.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a practitioner, Mr Jeyaretnam must know that it is not\r\n\r\nuncommon   for  the  accused  person  to  try  to   weaken   the\r\n\r\nprosecution's  case  by casting doubt on  the  manner  in  which\r\n\r\ninculpatory  evidence has been obtained.  And I understand  that\r\n\r\nvery\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noften,  this is done quite at the last minute - at the trial  or\r\n\r\nnearing  the trial, even though in the interim period there  may\r\n\r\nhave  been  other opportunities for the accused person  to  make\r\n\r\nthis  point.  The current law and practice, through  the  trial-within-a-trial  approach, or voir dire,  seeks  to  balance  the\r\n\r\npublic  interest  against the rights of the accused.   Over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  the  Courts have decided on what conduct is  proper  and\r\n\r\nwhat  is  not.   The  practice is now well-established  and  the\r\n\r\nsystem  works.  Therefore, I have no doubt that our Courts  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to play this important safeguarding role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talks about videotaping the suspects'\r\n\r\nstatements.  Again, this point has been covered in this House, I\r\n\r\nthink,  not once but twice in the past.  And here we  have  said\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  not  a fail-safe method. Who is to  say  that  the\r\n\r\naccused  would  not  make an allegation that  he  was  given  an\r\n\r\ninducement or threatened before the videotaping took place?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ultimately, every jurisdiction must find its own\r\n\r\nbalance.  In Singapore, we see it right to balance the rights of\r\n\r\nan  accused to be given a fair trial with the right of the State\r\n\r\nto  devise  rules to ensure that those who are guilty  will  not\r\n\r\ntake  advantage of the law and get away scot-free.  Hence, under\r\n\r\nour approach, a suspect has no inherent right to have his lawyer\r\n\r\npresent when the Police questions him.  Similarly, under section\r\n\r\n122(6)  of  the  CPC,  that section serves an  extremely  useful\r\n\r\npurpose  in  preventing  a  guilty  person  from  inventing  his\r\n\r\ndefences to surprise the prosecution at the trial.  And, indeed,\r\n\r\nin  the UK, the 1994 Criminal Justice Act has adopted a position\r\n\r\nsimilar to our `adverse inference' approach.  So the UK also has\r\n\r\nmoved  away  from the `right of silence' approach to a  position\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  ours.  But Mr Jeyaretnam does not  cite  that.   He\r\n\r\ncites the UK for other purposes which are useful to him but  not\r\n\r\nthose  areas  where  the UK has strengthened and  toughened  the\r\n\r\nregime.   And  this is not the only area, there are other  areas\r\n\r\ntoo.  The 1994 Criminal Justice Act, in conjunction with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Orders Act, in the UK, has also toughened  the  law\r\n\r\ngiving Police greater powers of seizure and search.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point really is that sufficient safeguards exist in\r\n\r\nour  laws  to  ensure that innocent persons are  not  convicted.\r\n\r\nJust  to  run through quickly, these safeguards are -  in  fact,\r\n\r\nProf.  Chin has mentioned them -  requiring prosecution to prove\r\n\r\nits  case  beyond  a reasonable doubt and to provide  sufficient\r\n\r\nparticulars  in the charge, exclusionary rules of evidence,  the\r\n\r\nright to be heard in open court, the right of appeal to a higher\r\n\r\ncourt; also the process of criminal revision and exercise by the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court of its supervisory revisionary jurisdiction, and  so\r\n\r\nforth.   Also, like I mentioned earlier, the Courts have devised\r\n\r\nprocesses  such as pre-trial conferences which have  facilitated\r\n\r\ngreater disclosure between prosecution and defence counsel.   So\r\n\r\nI think that has helped also to ensure a better balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I think the proof of the pudding is in the\r\n\r\neating.   Our  criminal justice system and its component  groups\r\n\r\nhave  received  accolades from both Singaporeans  and  objective\r\n\r\nthird parties.  For example, in 1996, the Singapore Police Force\r\n\r\nreceived about 870 compliments, including 14 from foreigners.  I\r\n\r\nshould  show  some  of these letters to Mr Jeyaretnam.   Because\r\n\r\nevery  letter of compliment tells a heart-warming story.   In  a\r\n\r\nsurvey commissioned by the Police Force in January 1997 covering\r\n\r\n1,300  Singaporeans, 84% of the respondents agreed  or  strongly\r\n\r\nagreed  that  the  Police was effective in maintaining  law  and\r\n\r\norder.  98% felt that the expectations were met by the Police in\r\n\r\ngeneral.   In a more recent survey commissioned by the  National\r\n\r\nYouth Council (NYC) in December last year where 600 youths  were\r\n\r\ninterviewed  face to face, 95% said that they  were  proud  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  was a safe country.  They would not have said  so  if\r\n\r\nthe  Police  does  not do its job properly in  protecting  their\r\n\r\ninterests, and dealing effectively with criminals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have also been renown surveys overseas. The\r\n\r\nPolitical and Economic Risk Consultancy or PERC, for example,  a\r\n\r\nHongkong-based organisation,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  its July 1997 issue, put Singapore's Judiciary and Police in\r\n\r\nthe  top  spot  in  Asia.   Both the World  Economic  Forum  and\r\n\r\nInternational Institute for Management Development (IMD)  ranked\r\n\r\nSingapore first in the area of security in 1996.  Respondents in\r\n\r\nthe  two  surveys were confident that their person and  property\r\n\r\nwere  protected  in Singapore.  Indeed, in this  year's  survey,\r\n\r\njust  released recently, IMD placed Singapore top  in  Asia  and\r\n\r\nfourth  world-wide in the justice ranking.  Therefore, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nbottom  line  is  that our law enforcement agencies  will  never\r\n\r\nbetray Singaporeans' trust and confidence in them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to quote one other example, which I had quoted before in\r\n\r\nthis House, but I think it bears reminding.  Because fair-minded\r\n\r\npeople  have, on honestly examining our criminal justice system,\r\n\r\ngiven  top  marks to Singapore.  This is the case of  Dr  Harald\r\n\r\nSchweizer,   who   came  to  Singapore,   visited   the   Police\r\n\r\nestablishments and looked at how our process works  first  hand.\r\n\r\nThat  was  in 1994 in the aftermath of the Michael Fay  episode.\r\n\r\nThe  House will remember that at that time, our system was under\r\n\r\nsevere  criticism by many, including the American media.  Rather\r\n\r\nthan  rely on second-hand media accounts or public comments,  Dr\r\n\r\nSchweizer,  an  Associate Professor of  Sociology  and  Criminal\r\n\r\nJustice  and  former Police Chief of a city  in  Texas,  visited\r\n\r\nSingapore.   At the end of his one-week visit, he was unstinting\r\n\r\nin  his praise for the Singapore Police Force.  This is what  he\r\n\r\nwrote to President Clinton, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"After a long dose of police reality in the US, and after\r\n\r\nvisiting numerous police agencies in Latin America and Europe, I\r\n\r\nwould  rather  be investigated by the SPF than any other  agency\r\n\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Police will exercise its powers in accordance with the law\r\n\r\nas  determined by the Courts, whether it is powers of arrest  or\r\n\r\npowers  of  interview or right of counsel.   Indeed,  there  are\r\n\r\nother  examples  where  our criminal justice  system,  including\r\n\r\nPolice investigation powers, have come out very well.  You  will\r\n\r\nremember,  for  example, the cases of John Martin Scripps  where\r\n\r\nPolice did a fine job in investigating\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  then securing his conviction; and Flor Contemplacion, which\r\n\r\nis an outstanding example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude and not take any more time of this\r\n\r\nHouse.   I  think enough time has been wasted by  Mr  Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nraking up this old issue.  The Government's position on law  and\r\n\r\norder  is clear.  Our fundamental concern is to safeguard public\r\n\r\ninterest - to protect Singaporeans and others who live or  visit\r\n\r\nSingapore  so  that  they will have peace  of  mind  that  their\r\n\r\npersons  and  properties are safe and secure.   We  do  this  by\r\n\r\nputting  the  interest  of  the community  first.   We  make  no\r\n\r\napologies  about  it.   But does it, therefore,  mean  that  the\r\n\r\nrights  of arrested persons are ignored?  The answer is a  clear\r\n\r\nno.   Their rights are there, they will be respected.  But  what\r\n\r\nthese rights are, every society must determine and find its  own\r\n\r\nbalance.   For  us  in  Singapore, our  laws  and  investigative\r\n\r\nmethods are fair.  They seek to draw out the facts and the truth\r\n\r\nso  that  justice  will prevail.  I think this is  the  starting\r\n\r\npoint  of  Mr  Jeyaretnam's speech today in this  House  -  that\r\n\r\njustice  must prevail.  So let me assure him and others in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  justice  will prevail and that there  are  adequate\r\n\r\nsafeguards.   And,  indeed,  Mr  Jeyaretnam  also  talks   about\r\n\r\naccountability, transparency, openness - yes, these  are  tenets\r\n\r\nwe will abide by.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our criminal justice system is working well. This state of\r\n\r\naffairs  has  not come about by accident.  It is the  result  of\r\n\r\nevery  component  part of the system - from the law  enforcement\r\n\r\nagencies such as the Police, to the Attorney-General's Chambers,\r\n\r\nto  our  Courts - playing its part efficiently, but  fairly  and\r\n\r\nproperly.   Indeed, the Chief Justice stated this in his  recent\r\n\r\nSubordinate  Courts  Workplan Seminar Keynote  Address  when  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"The  risks of the innocent being convicted, and  of  the\r\n\r\nguilty  being  acquitted, must be as low  as  human  fallibility\r\n\r\nallows.\"   Indeed,  this  sentiment  is  shared  by  the   other\r\n\r\ncomponent  groups  of our criminal justice system.   Whilst  the\r\n\r\nsystem  is not perfect, and no system is perfect, the effort  to\r\n\r\nmake  it a better one is on-going.  Definitely, there is no need\r\n\r\nfor  a  Commission  of Inquiry.  Indeed,  I  think  this  is  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam's pet approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHe  will  call for a committee, a board, a Commission of Inquiry\r\n\r\nat every turn, for whatever manner of topics.  But, Sir, this is\r\n\r\nnot how the PAP Government governs.  Yes, where appropriate,  we\r\n\r\ndo involve Singaporeans in many areas of civil society.  But let\r\n\r\nus  not  just do it because Mr Jeyaretnam, out of the blue,  six\r\n\r\nyears  after he had first made a call, comes to this  House  and\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Let's have a Commission of Inquiry.\" thus wasting  public\r\n\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final word must be on the people operating our\r\n\r\nsystem.   No  system is perfect or foolproof.   Ultimately,  any\r\n\r\nsystem  is  only as good as the people operating it.   The  best\r\n\r\nsafeguard,  therefore,  rests  in the  competence,  honesty  and\r\n\r\nintegrity  of the people administering the system, whether  they\r\n\r\nare  the investigators, prosecutors or judges.  As in all  other\r\n\r\nareas  of  public service in Singapore, members of the  criminal\r\n\r\njustice  system  are  geared  up  to  meet  these  high   public\r\n\r\nexpectations.  I am sure, Sir, they will not be found wanting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say, without any\r\n\r\ndisrespect to the two speakers, that my task has been made  very\r\n\r\neasy because no attempt has been made to come to grips as to how\r\n\r\nthese  men  came to be charged with murder and came very  close,\r\n\r\ntwo  of  them, to being hanged when they were totally  innocent.\r\n\r\nNo  attempt  has been made, I said, to try and explain  how  did\r\n\r\nthis  happen  in Singapore.  The junior Minister says  Singapore\r\n\r\nPolice  have  got  great praise.  But how did  this  happen?   I\r\n\r\nshudder  to think, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if the defence had  not\r\n\r\npressed  for  this  man who the defence said had  committed  the\r\n\r\nmurder,  and  he had not been called, the two men  charged  with\r\n\r\nmurder  may have been convicted and they would have been hanged.\r\n\r\nThen there is no recall of the punishment meted out to them.   I\r\n\r\nthink  if you want to be serious about this, you have to get  to\r\n\r\ngrips with the specific problem that was presented.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first speaker, Prof. Chin, and the Minister of State also,\r\n\r\nrely on the praise of the system.  The one thing we are avid for\r\n\r\nis  praise in Singapore.  We seem to be very eager to be praised\r\n\r\nby  people  outside.   But  who  are  these  people  who  praise\r\n\r\nSingapore?   Are they people who are qualified to speak  on  the\r\n\r\nPolice  investigation methods in Singapore?  Or are they talking\r\n\r\nabout  the efficiency?  I myself have praised the way the courts\r\n\r\nhave  speeded up trials.  But that is not what I am  complaining\r\n\r\nabout.   I  am talking about the investigation methods that  the\r\n\r\nPolice adopt.  Is the Minister aware that the confession in many\r\n\r\ncases  is  the  shortcut  method?  It spares  the  investigating\r\n\r\nofficer   from   having   to  go  and  make   minute,   detailed\r\n\r\ninvestigations  and to look for corroborative evidence.   So  he\r\n\r\nhas an interest in, if it is possible, getting an accused person\r\n\r\nto admit to the offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also talks about the doctrine of oppression. But I\r\n\r\ngave  an  example  of  a  man who was  subjected  to  continuous\r\n\r\nquestioning for 24 hours.  Is that not oppression?  How did that\r\n\r\ncome  about?   The Minister of State says there have  been  many\r\n\r\nchanges made since 1989.  I am glad to hear that, but he has not\r\n\r\ntold  us  what changes have been made.  Have we been  told  that\r\n\r\nthere are now new directives to police officers that questioning\r\n\r\nof  suspects  must not extend more than a certain  period,  that\r\n\r\nthey must be given rest, they must be given food and ensure that\r\n\r\nthey  are  given  food and rest?  Let us know  what  these  many\r\n\r\nimprovements that have been made since 1989.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of time was spent by the two speakers talking about what\r\n\r\nhappens  in  the  courts.  May I repeat.   My  concern  is  what\r\n\r\nhappens  when particularly, as I said, the weak, the uneducated,\r\n\r\nilliterate  man  is held in police custody, shut  off  from  the\r\n\r\nworld,  shut  off  from  members of his family,  shut  off  from\r\n\r\nseeking  any  counsel or lawyer's advice.  That  is  what  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  with.   I have said, in my speech,  that  there  were\r\n\r\nthese  men  who told the court that they only confessed  because\r\n\r\nthey  could  not take the treatment any longer.  The  court,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, accepted the evidence of the police officers that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey  did  not do anything to force the statement, the men  came\r\n\r\nout voluntarily with their statements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the question about audio taping. Does the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  know  that the Law Society of Singapore, some years  ago,\r\n\r\nmade a recommendation that audio taping of statements taken from\r\n\r\naccused  persons should be produced in court so that  the  court\r\n\r\nmay  listen to the audio tape and decide what exactly  went  on,\r\n\r\nwhat  questions  were  put and what answers  were  given  by  an\r\n\r\naccused person?  But that has not been accepted, let alone video\r\n\r\ntaping.   We have not made any recommendation for video  taping.\r\n\r\nBut there was this recommendation in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State says: what basis is there for a Commission\r\n\r\nof Inquiry?  May I repeat.  The basis is in this one case alone.\r\n\r\nAre  we  not interested in finding out how did this happen?   Or\r\n\r\nare  we not interested?  Are we going to say, \"Everything is all\r\n\r\nright with us.  We don't have to inquire into wild allegations.\"\r\n\r\nBut  these are not wild allegations.  The Minister of State says\r\n\r\nthat  the Judicial Commissioner found that the confessions  were\r\n\r\nmade  voluntarily.   I  do  not know whether  he  has  read  the\r\n\r\njudgement of the Judicial Commissioner.  As I said, the Judicial\r\n\r\nCommissioner  did  not  go into that  question.   There  was  no\r\n\r\nspecific  finding on that.  He simply said that the officer  had\r\n\r\nreasonable grounds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was surprised to hear the Minister say that just because a\r\n\r\nperson  is  acquitted, it did not mean that he  was  necessarily\r\n\r\ninnocent.   These men, as I said, were shown later to have  been\r\n\r\ntotally innocent.  There was no question about that.  So  please\r\n\r\ntry  and answer how is it that these men were charged.  And then\r\n\r\nhe  said  the  statements are only part of  the  evidence.   The\r\n\r\nPolice  have other evidence.  But, as I said, in this particular\r\n\r\ncase,  there was no other evidence.  There was only the evidence\r\n\r\nof  these men alleged to have been made and, as I indicated, the\r\n\r\nIO  took the view that once he had the confessions, that was it.\r\n\r\nHe  had  them in the bag.  There was no need to go and look  for\r\n\r\nother evidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised that the Minister of State says there is no\r\n\r\ninherent right in an accused person for lawyers.  What about the\r\n\r\nArticle  in the Constitution?  I know that the courts have  said\r\n\r\nthat  that right only avails after the Police have closed  their\r\n\r\ninvestigations and they can deny the right until then.  But  the\r\n\r\nConstitution does give the accused person a right.   Is  it  not\r\n\r\ntime we enforced this right in the Constitution?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says that there was a survey among Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nHas  the  survey  been carried out among persons  who  had  been\r\n\r\narrested and taken into police custody and what they felt  about\r\n\r\nit?   Almost  every accused person, and this has  been  reported\r\n\r\nonce  about a man who was in police custody who, I think at  the\r\n\r\ntrial, said anything could happen when one is in police custody.\r\n\r\nThose  were  his  words, \"anything can  happen\".   He  is  quite\r\n\r\nhelpless.  Are we not interested in protecting these men  whilst\r\n\r\nthey  are  in police custody?  As I said, I was hoping  that  we\r\n\r\nwould really get to grips with this case.  But we have not.  And\r\n\r\nall we have are statements that everything is all right with our\r\n\r\nsystem.  There is no need to have any Commission of Inquiry.  We\r\n\r\nare all right.  So let us carry on as we do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that there is a growing fear among\r\n\r\nlawyers.   Has  the  Minister of State spoken to  lawyers  about\r\n\r\ntheir  concern about innocent persons being found  guilty,  that\r\n\r\nthe  safeguards  are not enough?  And lawyers should  know  what\r\n\r\nthey   are  talking  about.   But  it  would  appear  that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment is not interested in what lawyers may think  or  what\r\n\r\nthe  public  may  think.  The Government is sure  that  what  it\r\n\r\nthinks is right and there is nothing wrong with our system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Just a short reply, Sir. I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  not  fair for Mr Jeyaretnam to  say  that  police\r\n\r\nofficers  try  to extract confession statements  as  a  shortcut\r\n\r\nmethod  to  look for corroborative evidence.  I  think  this  is\r\n\r\nreally  unfair.   As  I  said just now, there  is  no  incentive\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  to  extract  a confession from  an  innocent  person\r\n\r\nbecause  then  the  guilty party is still out  there  committing\r\n\r\ncrimes and giving more work to the Police.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I must assure this House that innocent people\r\n\r\nhave  nothing to fear.  The purpose of Police investigations  is\r\n\r\nto   uncover  the  truth.   That  is  the  purpose   of   Police\r\n\r\ninvestigations and not to convict innocent people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, when I mentioned the role of the courts, as did Prof. Chin, we\r\n\r\nare  not saying therefore that we are just focusing on what  the\r\n\r\ncourts have done.  But my point is that the courts can and  have\r\n\r\neffectively  acted  as a safeguard against  any  possibility  of\r\n\r\nPolice abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, he asked what improvements have been made since 1989.\r\n\r\nIf  he  had listened to my speech carefully, he would have heard\r\n\r\nthe  many improvements that have been made - team investigation,\r\n\r\npre-trial   conferencing,  the  fact  that  Police  looks   very\r\n\r\ncarefully at court decisions when it decides on whether  or  not\r\n\r\nthere is Police abuse, and the list goes on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I did not say that there is no inherent right to\r\n\r\ncounsel.  Yes, of course, the Constitution provides the right to\r\n\r\ncounsel.   But my point was that there is no inherent  right  to\r\n\r\ncounsel   during   Police  investigations.   The   courts   have\r\n\r\ninterpreted  Article  9  as  \"as soon  as  may  be  reasonable\",\r\n\r\ndefinitely not if it interferes with Police investigations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point, Sir, is that I have already, in my speech,\r\n\r\nhighlighted salient points on the case of Zainal bin Kuning  and\r\n\r\nwhy there was no Police impropriety or wrongdoing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister, when he said about\r\n\r\nimprovements, have any directives been given to police  officers\r\n\r\nabout  their questioning of suspects, as I said, how  long  they\r\n\r\ncan  be  questioned  and whether they are  given  sustenance,  a\r\n\r\nrecord is kept?

Members will recollect, one of the five  values\r\n\r\ndiscussed  was  \"consensus  instead  of  contention\".   Finally,\r\n\r\n\"contention\" was left out and it emerged as \"consensus  and  not\r\n\r\nconflict\".\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.46 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in this spirit that I am seeking this House's\r\n\r\npermission to debate this motion.  We should avoid conflict.  We\r\n\r\ncan and should debate issues.  We may disagree on points, we may\r\n\r\nhave  differences of opinion, but we should try to reconcile  to\r\n\r\nreach consensus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message which this motion puts forward is an extension\r\n\r\nof our Shared Values.  We should encourage consensus\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrather than contention.  The Shared Values did not deal with the\r\n\r\npolitical culture.  I hope this motion will help to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Constitution provides for the\r\n\r\nappointment of NMPs to give non-partisan views.  It is  in  this\r\n\r\nspirit  that I propose this motion.  It is therefore  reassuring\r\n\r\nto  recollect the words of the Leader of the House, Mr Wong  Kan\r\n\r\nSeng, in this House when he spoke on 5th June 1997.  I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Depending on the merits of the issues, the NMPs have, at\r\n\r\ntimes,  been  dissenting and critical, sometimes supportive  and\r\n\r\nother times constructive in their views.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are conscious of the fact that after the ruling\r\n\r\nparty,  the  NMPs form the second largest number of  Members  in\r\n\r\nthis  House and whatever views we express in this House will  be\r\n\r\nclosely watched by the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would allow me, Sir, at this juncture to outline the\r\n\r\nrole  of Parliament, as I see it.  Parliament is the final forum\r\n\r\nof  discussion where ideas are put forward and debated.  So,  by\r\n\r\nits very nature, Parliament is adversarial.  There is no running\r\n\r\naway  from  it.   The  question is: do we want  it  to  be  more\r\n\r\nadversarial or less adversarial?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Parliament also has other roles. It enacts laws,\r\n\r\nraises  taxes,  Government policies are discussed and  Ministers\r\n\r\nare  accountable to this Parliament.  Questions for Oral  Answer\r\n\r\nprovide  a  valuable  device to query the Ministers.   And  this\r\n\r\nmorning, we have seen how supplementary questions were asked  to\r\n\r\nelicit information for the benefit of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have inherited from the British the Westminster\r\n\r\nsystem  of government.  In Britain, it has taken more  than  500\r\n\r\nyears  to  achieve this position.  It was not an  easy  journey.\r\n\r\nThose  of  us  who  studied  constitutional  history  know  that\r\n\r\nParliament and the King would be in conflict.  Not everybody had\r\n\r\nthe right to vote.  Full franchise was only achieved during this\r\n\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British democracy was not always what it is today. In\r\n\r\nearlier centuries, heads had to be beheaded.  The Tower became\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhome  for some.  Civil wars came and went.  Even the true  sense\r\n\r\nof  Greek democracy could not serve the purpose today.  I do not\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  Greek  cities where people met  to  propose  or  to\r\n\r\noppose.   Perhaps  they met to discuss the common  will  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n.      Sir,  the  British  parliamentary  system  has  undergone\r\n\r\nchanges.  Just to illustrate, the office of the Speaker has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  so  secure and safe as it is today.  The Speaker,  in  the\r\n\r\nreal  sense of the word, was a speaker.  He spoke to the monarch\r\n\r\non  behalf  of  the Commons.  And many a time,  the  message  he\r\n\r\ncarried was not a welcome one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Western critics, especially the human rights\r\n\r\ngroups  and even a small group of our own people, feel that  the\r\n\r\nWestern  democracy, in the British sense of  the  word,  is  the\r\n\r\nideal  model to be emulated.  Maybe it is or maybe not, that  is\r\n\r\nfor  the  individual.   We may be wearing  Western  clothes  and\r\n\r\nspeaking  the English language, but in basic necessity of  human\r\n\r\nlife  like  diet,  we  still prefer and  love  our  fried  rice,\r\n\r\nnoodles,  rendang, thosai and prata.  As the  saying  goes,  one\r\n\r\nman's  meat  is  another man's poison, more  so  if  you  are  a\r\n\r\nvegetarian.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can do no better than to quote Pandit Jawaharlal\r\n\r\nNehru who was a great admirer of British democracy and who was a\r\n\r\ngreat freedom fighter, whose speeches  have been quoted in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  before.   Let me quote him.  This is  what  he  told  the\r\n\r\nIndian Constituent Assembly before independence.  He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are not going just to copy, I hope, a certain\r\n\r\ndemocratic procedure or an institution of a so-called democratic\r\n\r\ncountry.  We may improve upon it.  In any event, whatever system\r\n\r\nof  government we may establish here must fit in with the temper\r\n\r\nof  our  people  and  be  acceptable  to  them.   We  stand  for\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  It will be for this House to determine what shape to\r\n\r\ngive that democracy, the fullest democracy, I hope.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think one of the basic tragedies of Asian leaders\r\n\r\nwas  that  they copied the constitutions of Britain, France  and\r\n\r\nAmerica.   They  imported Western government values  to  eastern\r\n\r\nsocieties.  As a result, most of the constitutions have  failed.\r\n\r\nVery few have succeeded and I will come to that later.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have an abiding faith in the people of Singapore and\r\n\r\nalso  the  political leadership and that we could have a  better\r\n\r\nsystem  of  governance.   We have won international  praise  for\r\n\r\neconomic  miracles  for our sound financial  policies,  for  our\r\n\r\nhousing  scheme, for our security and safety, and even  for  our\r\n\r\nenvironmental   matters.    But   what   is   saddening,    Sir,\r\n\r\noccasionally,  what comes under criticism is our governance.   I\r\n\r\nhave  faith and hope that in the next 10 years, we will  succeed\r\n\r\neven in this area.  We, the people and the Government, must work\r\n\r\nout  a  system that will not just be a praise from the West  but\r\n\r\nthat  the people of Singapore themselves will feel that it is  a\r\n\r\nsystem ideally suited to our soil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion is very straightforward. It is not a\r\n\r\nbinding resolution.  Members are free to speak.   The Government\r\n\r\ncan respond in the way it feels best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said earlier, in many British colonies, the\r\n\r\nBritish  Westminster  model  was  held  as  an  ideal  form   of\r\n\r\ngovernment.   And most of the nationalist leaders  like  Mahatma\r\n\r\nGandhi,  Nehru, our former Prime Minister, the former  Malaysian\r\n\r\nleader, Tunku Abdul Rahman, were all educated in England.   They\r\n\r\nwere mostly lawyers and socialism was a respectable creed.   Sad\r\n\r\nto   say,   as   I  said  earlier,  few  countries  have   their\r\n\r\nconstitutions  intact.  Some countries had to  impose  emergency\r\n\r\nrule.   Even  those  who have succeeded had  their  constitution\r\n\r\nsuspended and had to live with a bout of military dictatorship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have even a shorter history of\r\n\r\nconstitutional development.  Election was first introduced after\r\n\r\nthe  war  in  1948 and it was very limited.  There was  no  full\r\n\r\nfranchise.   But  the  turning  point  came  in  1959  with  the\r\n\r\nattainment  of  self-government.  Prior to this, the  Government\r\n\r\nwhich  constituted basically the Governor and his Secretary  and\r\n\r\nthe colonial office in London decided our fate and future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only those of us who have lived during the colonial\r\n\r\ndays  can  understand the denial and humiliation.   The  joy  of\r\n\r\ngaining self-rule was evident when the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore celebrated with joy the attainment of  self-government.  Speaking from the steps of City Hall in June  1959,\r\n\r\nMr Lee Kuan Yew echoed the feeling of the people when he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Once in a long while in the history of a people there\r\n\r\ncomes a moment of great change.  Tonight is such a moment in our\r\n\r\nlives.   Last Saturday saw the end of an era.  This morning  the\r\n\r\nnew Constitution was promulgated.  We begin a new chapter in the\r\n\r\nhistory  of  Singapore.  The powers of the people through  their\r\n\r\nelected  government is limited to our internal affairs.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot  what  we  really  want.  It is but a step  forward  towards\r\n\r\nmerger and Merdeka.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have succeeded because we changed the system to\r\n\r\nsuit  our  needs.   We must keep an open mind  and  bring  about\r\n\r\nchanges  which will strengthen our system.  We have  an  elected\r\n\r\nPresident,  GRCs,  NCMP, NMPs and the Maintenance  of  Religious\r\n\r\nHarmony  Act,  just to mention a few.   Outside  Parliament,  we\r\n\r\nhave  the  Feedback Unit, GPCs and bodies like the Institute  of\r\n\r\nPolicy  Studies (IPS) and other civic bodies.  In short, we  are\r\n\r\nevolving  our  own  practices to suit our  economic  and  social\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of IPS, it has regular discussions with\r\n\r\ninterested  groups.  Its \"Singapore  the Year in Review\"  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant  discussion  which gives an  overview  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have attended two of these discussions and the way\r\n\r\npanelists,   including  my  Friend,  Dr  Lee  Tsao  Yuan,   were\r\n\r\nquestioned  assured me that our young people are not conformists\r\n\r\nand  they  have  a questioning mind.  In short,  they  will  not\r\n\r\naccept things at face value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I hope bodies like the Roundtable will flourish.\r\n\r\nIt is important to have non-partisan institutions.  Therefore, I\r\n\r\nwas  saddened  to  see  its motive questioned  by  some  of  our\r\n\r\nleaders.   I thought that the Roundtable was being very  helpful\r\n\r\nfor  its review of the last general elections, pointing out some\r\n\r\nof its pitfalls.  However, Sir, I am glad and reassured that two\r\n\r\nof  its  members, Mr Simon Tay and Mr Zulkifli, now sit in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  We should try to support groups like the Roundtable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries of Asia, confrontational politics has\r\n\r\ndivided the people and retarded economic progress.  Political\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nparties  have mushroomed and people with doubtful standing  have\r\n\r\ncontested and won elections.  Parties enter an alliance to share\r\n\r\npower.   Politicians change parties to be  in  power.   The  end\r\n\r\nresult  is  that the people have suffered, and the parliamentary\r\n\r\nsystem has been put to stress.  Perhaps I could, for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  Members, give some synopsis of the Westminster's  system  of\r\n\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Westminster's system of government, the\r\n\r\ngovernment  is divided into three organs - the Legislature,  the\r\n\r\nExecutive and the Judiciary.  Both the legislature and judiciary\r\n\r\nare highly adversarial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to show how our judicial system, which has\r\n\r\nbeen  mentioned  by the Minister of  State earlier,  has  become\r\n\r\nless  adversarial.   As we all know, in the  court  trial  every\r\n\r\nargument has to be challenged and demolished in order to be won.\r\n\r\nSingapore   has   implemented   mediation,   conciliation    and\r\n\r\narbitration  to  settle  disputes.  As the  Minister  of  State,\r\n\r\nAssoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee, had earlier pointed out in this House,\r\n\r\nwe  are  now  implementing  community mediation.   Our  judicial\r\n\r\nsystem  has been held as a model.   I know some Members may  not\r\n\r\nagree but the general tone is, both in Singapore and outside, we\r\n\r\nhave  a  first class judicial system.  I know of one  particular\r\n\r\nChief Justice from the Commonwealth countries who has shown some\r\n\r\ninterest.   In  fact,  he has sent some  judges  to  study  this\r\n\r\nsystem.   This change came about without any pressure  from  the\r\n\r\npublic.   The  judiciary had recognised the  need  to  transform\r\n\r\nbecause  there  were backlogs of cases.  The new  Chief  Justice\r\n\r\nfelt  that  we could not carry on with the old and he introduced\r\n\r\nnew  methods.  The backlog has gone.  Cases are dealt with  more\r\n\r\nexpeditiously  and  so there is no waiting time  for  criminals.\r\n\r\nThey  get  their  just  dessert in time.   Can  this  Parliament\r\n\r\nsimilarly take the lead in bringing about some change that  will\r\n\r\nbenefit the country?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members may ask why there is a need to discuss this\r\n\r\nmotion  when  the system is working well.  Many of our  citizens\r\n\r\ntake   for   granted  that  the  system  will  survive  forever.\r\n\r\nExperience of other countries provides valuable lessons.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSome  countries  take pride of their democracy, but  even  local\r\n\r\ncommunities  are  often  divided on political  line.   Sometimes\r\n\r\nfamilies,  relatives  and  even areas  are  divided  because  of\r\n\r\npolitical   affiliation.    They  adopt   very   confrontational\r\n\r\npolitics.   Violence,  arson, killing  of  political  opponents,\r\n\r\ncriminals  run for office and in some countries, booth capturing\r\n\r\nhas become a political art.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A younger generation encouraged by political debate\r\n\r\nelsewhere  may  want  to  emulate the confrontational  politics.\r\n\r\nThey  look  forward to heated debate in the House.   Some  think\r\n\r\nthat  if there is no controversy in the House, it is a lame duck\r\n\r\nParliament.   It  is  not the intensity of the  debate  but  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  the  debate  which should  be  the  hallmark.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  that has to be asked is this.  Has the policy improved\r\n\r\nthe  living standard of the people?  Has it brought a more  just\r\n\r\nand equal society?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Sir, we are a multi-racial, multi-lingual and\r\n\r\nmulti-religious  nation.   People  and  political  parties  must\r\n\r\nrecognise that there are fundamental matters which we must never\r\n\r\ntransgress.   These are beyond questions.  To do so would result\r\n\r\nin  undermining the foundation on which our peace and prosperity\r\n\r\nis built.  Similarly, in dealing with the judiciary and security\r\n\r\nwe   have   to  be  very  circumspect.   Whenever  our  national\r\n\r\ninstitutions are under attack, we must close ranks  and  defend.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot  be  divided  when our sovereignty  and  security  is\r\n\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how do we go about bringing a change in the thinking\r\n\r\nand  mindset?  I would appeal to the ruling party  and  hope  to\r\n\r\npersuade  them  to consult the opposition parties in  Parliament\r\n\r\nwhenever  major  issues  -  I emphasise  \"major  issues\"  -  are\r\n\r\ndiscussed.  When the ruling party is prepared to listen to views\r\n\r\nfrom the public, why not political parties in Parliament?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition parties in Parliament must give constructive\r\n\r\nviews  that  will help policy and not to oppose the policy  just\r\n\r\nbecause  it is a Government policy.  If I could recollect,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen the Select\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCommittee was discussing the amendment to the Constitution,  one\r\n\r\npolitical party's representative made an absurd proposition that\r\n\r\nthe  Bill was unconstitutional.  The learned man was challenging\r\n\r\na  Member  of  the  Select Committee, Prof. Jayakumar,  who  had\r\n\r\nlectured  Constitutional  Law at  NUS.   The  politician  was  a\r\n\r\nBritish trained lawyer.  He had not studied the Constitution  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a subject.  Had he studied it in some  detail,  he\r\n\r\nwould  have  realised that there was precedent  for  non-elected\r\n\r\nMembers  in  the   Constitution even before it was  amended.   I\r\n\r\nspeak  of  the appointment of Speaker from outside  the  elected\r\n\r\nMembers.   Sir,  we must avoid a similar situation.   Opposition\r\n\r\nfor  the sake of opposition is negative and futile.  I think the\r\n\r\nopposition parties must change their thinking.  If they want  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  the  political process, they must  review  their\r\n\r\nstand.  It calls for a change in outlook.  It is hard to believe\r\n\r\nthat the Government does not deserve the praise for many of  its\r\n\r\nachievements,  be  it in housing, transport, education  and  the\r\n\r\nbanking system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a policy is discussed in Parliament, some of the\r\n\r\nbest  minds  in the civil service would have studied the  matter\r\n\r\nover  many  months, often making comparative studies with  other\r\n\r\ncountries  and  trying to avoid any shortcoming.  Our  Ministers\r\n\r\nand   MPs  consult  the  public  through  feedback  and  through\r\n\r\npolitical  discussions  among the PAP activists.  They  have  to\r\n\r\nconvince  the  people.   No policy can  succeed  unless  it  has\r\n\r\npopular support from the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a feeling among some members of the public\r\n\r\nthat some Members of the PAP treat the opposition with contempt.\r\n\r\nThe PAP has succeeded in being elected with such an overwhelming\r\n\r\nsupport.   This  may lead to some MPs thinking  that  opposition\r\n\r\nparties are peripheral.  Success sometimes brings some degree of\r\n\r\nintellectual superiority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate that there is a place for\r\n\r\nopposition  parties in Parliament. Some constructive  opposition\r\n\r\nwill  be  good  to  our system.  But to say  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\ndemocracy without opposition is an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nintellectual dishonesty.  In the final choice, the  people  must\r\n\r\ndecide  whether they want an opposition or not.  It is  not  for\r\n\r\nthe  opposition to decide.  For that matter, it is not even  for\r\n\r\nthe PAP to decide whether there should be an opposition or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the benefit of visiting some countries and observing\r\n\r\ntheir system.  In many countries, they not only abuse each other\r\n\r\nverbally  but physically in Parliament.  Shoes and slippers  fly\r\n\r\nin  the well of the Chambers.  Even the Presiding Officer is  in\r\n\r\nfear  of  himself.  Sir, it is a credit to our  Parliament  that\r\n\r\neven during the hey-days of Barisan Sosialis, the proceedings in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber were conducted with decorum and dignity.  This  is\r\n\r\nwhat Parliament is and we should aspire to be so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries, it has become a part of life to enjoy\r\n\r\nconflicts.  The media especially enjoys reporting this conflict.\r\n\r\nWe  too  had  our  share of confrontational  politics  when  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  merger was discussed.  The House sat  past  dinner\r\n\r\ntime  many a night to debate the issues.  The Ministers, instead\r\n\r\nof  concentrating on economic development, had to spend hours of\r\n\r\ntheir  time defending the Government's existence.  Those  of  us\r\n\r\nwho were young can remember it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a tendency among some of our younger citizens\r\n\r\nto  expect Parliament to have heated debates.  They think it  is\r\n\r\nfun and game.  They think it is tamasha, a show to be enjoyed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is fashionable to be confrontational, some of\r\n\r\nour intellectuals think that democracy without confrontation  is\r\n\r\na tame democracy or, worse still, no democracy.  We have to tell\r\n\r\nthem  that  the  ultimate  test is whether  the  Government  has\r\n\r\nbrought  happiness to the lives of the people  and  whether  the\r\n\r\npeople can live a life of dignity and freedom instead of fear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how do we strengthen the consultative process? This\r\n\r\nis  a question that I pose to this House.  In the last 10 years,\r\n\r\nmore  avenues have been opened up.  Our Prime Minister is a firm\r\n\r\nbeliever  in the consultative process.  He has set up Government\r\n\r\nParliamentary Committees (GPCs). These Committees also include\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmembers from the public as resource panel members, and I am  one\r\n\r\nsuch member of the GPC for Community Development which is headed\r\n\r\nby Dr S. Vasoo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in February 1991, I wrote to the Prime Minister about\r\n\r\nthe  enhanced  role  of  the GPCs. The  Prime  Minister  gave  a\r\n\r\npositive  reply  and,  in fact, in the  President's   Speech  in\r\n\r\nFebruary 1991, the matter was dealt with.  May I quote from  the\r\n\r\nSpeech of the President:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Government Parliamentary Committees will play a more\r\n\r\nprominent  role.   We will encourage the public  to  give  their\r\n\r\nviews  to the GPCs, especially on issues which do not go to  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.  The GPCs should not only express these  views\r\n\r\nin  Parliament,  but  also  follow  them  through  by  proposing\r\n\r\namendments to improve legislation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have two observations. First, bring the GPCs within\r\n\r\nthe  purview  of  the  House.  At the  moment,  it  is  not  so.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  GPCs should be given manpower and money  to  play  an\r\n\r\nenhanced  role.   On  important Bills, GPCs  should  invite  the\r\n\r\npublic  to  give  written representations.   I  wonder  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's plan has not been implemented, especially  when  it\r\n\r\nwas first announced in 1991.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Community Development has started its\r\n\r\nFeedback  Unit.  The Unit in fact has improved and a  number  of\r\n\r\nCommittees  have  been  set up to study different  issues.   The\r\n\r\nmembers  are  well  qualified  and  respected  members  of   our\r\n\r\ncommunity.   I  can foresee an important input by  the  Feedback\r\n\r\nUnit, now that the Minister of State, Dr John Chen, a Government\r\n\r\nMinister, is at the helm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our media is taking an active interest in topical\r\n\r\nissues.   The  Straits  Times  has  a  political  desk  and  its\r\n\r\n\"Insight\"  covers current issues with some depth, getting  views\r\n\r\nfrom  people  of all strata. The lead articles give opinions  on\r\n\r\ntopical issues.  The Straits Times through its lead articles and\r\n\r\nForum  Page  helped in changing the tone of the  Maintenance  of\r\n\r\nParents  Act.   Because of this input, the Act is a  better  Act\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, let me add that there is a lingering\r\n\r\nperception  in  the minds of some sections of our intelligentsia\r\n\r\nthat our print media is overtly pro-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment.   It is for the print media to take the  heed.   But\r\n\r\nthere  is no running away that in the case of the Straits Times,\r\n\r\nit  has come of age as a result of its ability to draw out  some\r\n\r\nof the best young men and women.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a very lively Forum column. People express\r\n\r\ntheir  views.   But again there is a small minority  which  feel\r\n\r\nthat  if  they  criticise the Government policy, they  would  be\r\n\r\nridiculed  or, worse still, questioned by the authority.   These\r\n\r\nfears,  I  would like to assure them, are unfounded.   Catherine\r\n\r\nLim   was  an  unfortunate  episode.   The  boundary  line   for\r\n\r\ndiscussion  has  to be redrawn from time to time.   Our  leaders\r\n\r\nsometimes act like over-protective parents.  They must learn  to\r\n\r\ntrust  the people.  Singaporeans are pragmatic.  They know which\r\n\r\nside  of the bread is buttered.  They are not going to be  taken\r\n\r\naway  by sweet talks.  They value political stability more  than\r\n\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the past is any gauge of the future, there seems to be a\r\n\r\ndim  possibility of any credible and strong opposition  emerging\r\n\r\nin  the  near  future.  Parliament may have  to  consider  other\r\n\r\noptions to strengthen the present system. Those who do not agree\r\n\r\nwith the ruling party should have a channel of communication. We\r\n\r\nmay  want  to institutionalise some of them.  I have  spoken  of\r\n\r\nthat  earlier.   Perhaps the Town Councils and  the  CDCs  could\r\n\r\nprovide  valuable  inputs in addition to the  existing  channels\r\n\r\nlike  RCs  and CCCs.  These bodies could be further strengthened\r\n\r\nby  soliciting ideas from the residents.  As their meetings  are\r\n\r\nmostly closed door, it will encourage a free flow of ideas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I am glad that private housing estates are\r\n\r\nalso  going to form their own Committees.  My plea is that these\r\n\r\nCommittees should work with the existing institutions in the HDB\r\n\r\nheartlands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I urge the Government leaders to consider\r\n\r\nreviewing   the  electoral  arrangement.   Whilst  the   present\r\n\r\nelectoral arrangement should be largely adhered to, maybe  about\r\n\r\n10%   of  the  Members  of  this  House  could  be  elected   on\r\n\r\nproportional representation.  I know the danger of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproportional  representation. But yet I  am  making  this  plea.\r\n\r\nThis  is  why  I  am keeping only 10% as the upper  limit.   Or,\r\n\r\nperhaps,  even the NCMP scheme could be enlarged.  Sir,  I  know\r\n\r\nwhen  the NCMP scheme was first announced, some parties  opposed\r\n\r\nit.  But parties have changed position, I hope, for the good  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and for themselves as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our civil society is growing; our clan associations\r\n\r\nand self-help bodies can help in giving input as well.  It is in\r\n\r\nour  Republic's interest to nurture a civil society.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nI  found  it reassuring that the Prime Minister told this  House\r\n\r\nlast  year that he wanted a civil society to grow.  May I  quote\r\n\r\nfrom his speech, Sir?  He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We need a civil society to mobilise our people's energies\r\n\r\nand  talents,  and  to create a cohesive and  resilient  nation.\r\n\r\nWhen   people  participate  actively  and  become  involved   in\r\n\r\ncommunity  and national issues, they build ties among themselves\r\n\r\nand bond to the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must change the mindset that only a few leaders at the\r\n\r\ntop  of  the  system  need to think and take responsibility  for\r\n\r\nsocial and national issues, while the rest of society can simply\r\n\r\nmind  their  own business and go about their daily  lives.   All\r\n\r\nSingaporeans must feel a responsibility for solving local issues\r\n\r\nand shaping their own communities.  They should not wait for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to solve every problem.  The Government itself  must\r\n\r\nbe  prepared to take a step back and perhaps even a  back  seat,\r\n\r\nespecially on local community issues, and allow some  free  play\r\n\r\nto develop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One good way to do this is for concerned citizens to get\r\n\r\ninvolved in voluntary work or in the running of their own  local\r\n\r\ncommunities,   through   the  Town  Councils,   CDCs   or   RCs.\r\n\r\nSingapore's  political  life must evolve  in  the  direction  of\r\n\r\ngreater  participation  by  the  people,  more  willingness   to\r\n\r\nshoulder  responsibilities, and more giving to the country  than\r\n\r\ntaking.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From consultation, Sir, I now move to consensus. This is\r\n\r\nthe  most  difficult  task because of conflicting  interest  and\r\n\r\nlobby groups.  It is not possible for the Government to seek the\r\n\r\nviews  of everybody on every issue.  To do so would be to weaken\r\n\r\nthe  working  of  the  government.  But  on  major  issues  like\r\n\r\nhousing,  transportation and education,  the  Government  should\r\n\r\nreach  consensus,  both  within the political  parties  and  the\r\n\r\npeople.   In this, I think the civic groups can play  a  pivotal\r\n\r\nrole in articulating views.  Similarly, the various\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsocieties and interested groups should study the issues and give\r\n\r\ntheir views to the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is interested in building consensus.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not surprising that the PAP Government agreed to\r\n\r\nincorporate public views in preparing its political manifesto  - The  Next Lap.  This is the best form of consensus building  for\r\n\r\nthe PAP.  Similarly, the Government has set up Select Committees\r\n\r\non  important issues like GRC, Elected President and Maintenance\r\n\r\nof  Religious  Harmony  Act.   These Committees  benefited  from\r\n\r\npublic  participation and in some of the cases public  proposals\r\n\r\nwere  accepted.  Take the case of the GRC Bill.   The  Bill  was\r\n\r\namended to include a minimum number of seats for the minorities,\r\n\r\nand the Indian community was mentioned by name.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on conciliation, Sir. We can take heed from the\r\n\r\nindustrial strife in the 1960s and the orderly manner  in  which\r\n\r\nour  commerce and industry has prospered because of this process\r\n\r\nof conciliation with the labour and employers.  We have to trade\r\n\r\noff  some  points.  We have to accommodate because, as has  been\r\n\r\nsaid  previously,  nobody  or  institution  has  a  monopoly  of\r\n\r\nknowledge.   We sometimes make mistakes but we must  learn  from\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying that at the family level, the disputes are\r\n\r\nnow  settled  through conciliation in our family courts  in  the\r\n\r\nSubordinate  Courts.   This is indeed a very  progressive  step.\r\n\r\nCan the same process be adopted at the national level?  Whenever\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  difference  on  major issues,  we  should  try  to\r\n\r\naccommodate the other's wishes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whenever we are talking of consensus, conciliation and\r\n\r\nconsultation, one thing must stand out - that it must be in  the\r\n\r\nnational interest to discuss it, to adopt it.  We must not allow\r\n\r\nsectarian  interest  to do so.  We should never  have  a  hidden\r\n\r\nagenda.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I started my speech on the Shared Values and I want to\r\n\r\nend  on  the same note.  I want hon. Members to reflect  on  the\r\n\r\nwords of the Deputy Prime Minister BG Lee.  Let me quote him:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In every society there are disputes and differences of\r\n\r\nopinions,  over private matters, over commercial  affairs,  over\r\n\r\ngreat issues of state.  It is only natural and healthy.  Without\r\n\r\nconstructive  debate,  without a lively exchange  of  views,  no\r\n\r\nsociety  can  hope to break new ground and make  progress.   But\r\n\r\nsocieties  differ  in  the ways by which they  seek  to  resolve\r\n\r\ndifferences of views.  Some try to conciliate opposing views and\r\n\r\nsmooth  over the differences; others fight it out in adversarial\r\n\r\nproceedings in Court.  They believe that out of sound  and  fury\r\n\r\nwill come sweetness and light.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I had\r\n\r\noriginally  wanted  to support the motion  raised  by  our  hon.\r\n\r\nNominated  Member.   But having heard the  speech  of  our  hon.\r\n\r\nMember, I can only say that while I agree with the principle  of\r\n\r\nthe  motion, I cannot support the conclusion which he wants this\r\n\r\nHouse to adopt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just keep this response rather brief in order that\r\n\r\nwe can deal with the issues on hand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question that we have to ask ourselves is: can\r\n\r\nthere  be  a less adversarial approach to politics?   To  answer\r\n\r\nthis  question, I think we need to ask an even more  fundamental\r\n\r\nquestion  about  the  role  of this  House  in  the  legislative\r\n\r\nprocess.   Do  we  see legislators in this House  as  performing\r\n\r\nprimarily  the  role  of  a critic to scrutinise  and  embarrass\r\n\r\nGovernment?   Or do we see the role of this House  as  one  that\r\n\r\nseeks  to  improve the legislative process so that the interests\r\n\r\nof the people can be better served?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will note that the collapse of communism in the\r\n\r\n80s  has  brought about an increasing convergence  of  political\r\n\r\nideologies.   Communism and socialism, as we  know  it,  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger  fashionable.   Few would deny that the  market  economy,\r\n\r\nfounded  on  a model of democracy that seeks to equitably  share\r\n\r\nwealth  of  a country, is a dominant political ideology  in  the\r\n\r\nworld today.  While there are differences as to how one may find\r\n\r\nexpression to these values, it will be difficult for the  masses\r\n\r\nto  find  favour  with anyone who says that  he  believes  in  a\r\n\r\ncommand  economy  and  in a dictatorial regime  which  does  not\r\n\r\naccount  to  the people.  The left and the right  it  seems  are\r\n\r\nmoving towards the middle ground.  In this climate, it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  be  very difficult for parties to take extreme positions.\r\n\r\nNo  party  seeking the mandate of the people can move away  from\r\n\r\nthis middle ground and seek to win the right to rule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislators must recognise this. The way to the middle\r\n\r\nground  and politics is not through adversarial approach because\r\n\r\nit  is  not  a  competition of ideologies  but  a  consultative,\r\n\r\nconsensus  and  conciliation approach or what we call  consensus\r\n\r\napproach.  Sir, to that extent, therefore, I support the call of\r\n\r\nthe  Nominated Member that we should move towards a position  in\r\n\r\nour  political arena that is more consensus seeking rather  than\r\n\r\nadversarial in approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, endorsing consensus politics does\r\n\r\nnot  in  itself mean an end to competition.  The choice  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  can be made on the basis of personalities, on the  basis\r\n\r\nof  how we want to approach the objects that are defined as  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the country.  To that extent, therefore, we  should\r\n\r\nask   ourselves  how  this  approach  to  politics  applies   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving his motion, the Nominated Member actually called\r\n\r\nfor  the Government to consult the Opposition Members in the way\r\n\r\nwe   formulate  policies.   I  find  this  rather  strange   and\r\n\r\nsurprising because in the nature of our political process  where\r\n\r\nwe  are  required to go to the people to seek a mandate  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Democracy is necessarily a question of choice.  At  the\r\n\r\nend  of  five  years or so, we go back to the  people  with  our\r\n\r\nrecord, our platform, and our agenda to persuade the people that\r\n\r\nwe offer the best slate of leaders and programmes for our people\r\n\r\nto  choose.   Asking  us  to consult the Opposition  Members  as\r\n\r\nregards policy formulation is like asking the opposing team in a\r\n\r\nfootball  field  how you play the game.  In the  nature  of  our\r\n\r\npolitics,  I  think  it  will be quite unusual  indeed.   It  is\r\n\r\nsomething which does not make sense for us at this moment.   And\r\n\r\nI  do  not think we have arrived at a position where we need  to\r\n\r\nconsult the Opposition in respect of policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Nominated Member has also asked us to consider to\r\n\r\nreview  the  electoral arrangement to bring about a proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation  by  10%  in  this House  itself.   This  is  not\r\n\r\nsomething  which, I think, makes sense or is supported.   If  we\r\n\r\ntalk about 10% proportional representation in the House, on what\r\n\r\nbasis  are  you  deciding as to who has the right  to  make  the\r\n\r\nrepresentation in this House?  As we all know it, in the  nature\r\n\r\nof  our  system, there are many avenues within this  House  that\r\n\r\nprovide  ample  opportunities for people outside to  make  their\r\n\r\nrepresentations and make their views known.  The  fact  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  NMPs and an NCMP in this House and the fact that  we  have\r\n\r\navenues  for people to participate in the policy process  itself\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  there  are avenues within the  House  that  allow\r\n\r\npeople to participate in the policy process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, therefore, while I understand the call on the part of\r\n\r\nthe  Nominated  Member  to  actually  open  up  the  process  of\r\n\r\nconsultation in policy making, I do not think that we should  go\r\n\r\nthat far in the way that he has suggested, and I would call upon\r\n\r\nthe  Member  to  essentially look at the position  that  he  has\r\n\r\nadvanced  more carefully.  I think in the nature of  things,  in\r\n\r\nthe   nature   that  we  understand  it,  there  are  sufficient\r\n\r\nsafeguards for us to consider the opposing views, if there  are,\r\n\r\nin  the  way in which policies are made and considered  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I basically do not support the motion to\r\n\r\nthe  extent  that  he  has  asked us to  support  the  call  for\r\n\r\nconsultation  of  the Opposition and to expand the  proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation in this House to include other interest groups as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  been in this House for 18 years and I have engaged in many\r\n\r\ndebates  in  this House and I do not think we were  adversarial.\r\n\r\nWe were hard-hitting, yes.  We take the Ministers on.  They give\r\n\r\nus  a  few punches back.  But at the end of the day, we  have  a\r\n\r\nmeaningful debate.  We share views, constructive in nature, yes.\r\n\r\nBut  we  were never adversarial.  So I was quite surprised  when\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsubject   was   brought  up,  asking  for  a  less   adversarial\r\n\r\nparliamentary  system.   He even said that  during  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  days, yes, those were hot days when the  debates  were\r\n\r\nvery  heated, but I do not think, if you go through the Hansard,\r\n\r\nthere  were  instances  where there  were  things  being  thrown\r\n\r\naround.   But  in  asking  this House  to  support  for  a  less\r\n\r\nadversarial  system  gives  the  impression  that  we   had   an\r\n\r\nadversarial  system  in the past.  It had  been  non-adversarial\r\n\r\ndebates in this House for so long.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do not know whether he is directing this to any\r\n\r\npolitical  party in this House that is adversarial.  I  can  say\r\n\r\nthat the PAP Members in this House are not adversarial.  We  are\r\n\r\nhard-hitting, as I said, sometimes.  But at the end of the  day,\r\n\r\nwe  are not adversarial.  So the Member who proposes this motion\r\n\r\nshould  state  clearly in this House which  political  party  is\r\n\r\nadversarial.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to focus\r\n\r\non  the  second  part  of the motion, that is,  that  the  House\r\n\r\nrecognises the need to evolve a parliamentary system which  will\r\n\r\nfurther strengthen the process of consultation and consensus.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to make three broad points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that there is a relative lack of effective mechanism\r\n\r\nfor public policy discourse in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, that Parliament which represents the elected voice\r\n\r\nof   the  people  can  be  more  effectively  used  as  a  major\r\n\r\ninstitution for public policy engagement; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I shall then propose several means by which\r\n\r\nParliament can more effectively serve this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to submit to this House a hypothesis regarding\r\n\r\nthe  current situation where consultation and consensus building\r\n\r\nis  concerned.  As an economist, I think in economic  terms,  so\r\n\r\nplease  allow  me to use an economic analogy.   I  believe  that\r\n\r\nthere  is at present a disequilibrium situation of excess demand\r\n\r\nfor public policy discussion.  There is now a greater demand for\r\n\r\npublic  consultation and feedback than in  the  past,  and  this\r\n\r\ndemand is likely to increase even more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  future.   At the same time, particularly in the  1990s,  the\r\n\r\nsupply  of  channels  for  public  policy  discourse  has   also\r\n\r\nincreased.   There  are  now  more  channels,  both  formal  and\r\n\r\ninformal,  for  consultation  and feedback.   However,  I  would\r\n\r\nsubmit that the increase in demand has outpaced the increase  in\r\n\r\nsupply resulting in a disequilibrium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the marketplace, such an excess demand situation would be\r\n\r\ncorrected  during  adjustment  in  prices.   However,   in   the\r\n\r\nintellectual  marketplace of ideas, there is no  such  automatic\r\n\r\nmechanism  to  adjust for a situation of excess  demand.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  a disequilibrium situation of excess demand can persist\r\n\r\nfor some time.  As in the case of economics, I believe that such\r\n\r\na disequilibrium situation is unhealthy and that steps should be\r\n\r\ntaken to rectify the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has demand for public policy discourse increased? I can\r\n\r\noffer three reasons.  The first reason is that our very economic\r\n\r\nsuccess  has satisfied our basic human needs and has  engendered\r\n\r\nthe   desire   for  higher  order  needs,  such  as   that   for\r\n\r\nparticipation and belonging in society.  Over the last 30 years,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  GDP  per capita has increased by more  than  eight-fold.   This increase in real per capita income has enabled  our\r\n\r\nmaterial  quality of life to improve by leaps and bounds.   Home\r\n\r\nownership, ownership of consumer durables, life expectancy,  all\r\n\r\nof  these  have shown marked improvement.  In short,  our  basic\r\n\r\nmaterial needs are by now more than taken care of.  A generation\r\n\r\nago,  our  parents'  prime concerns were mainly  over  making  a\r\n\r\ndecent  living,  owning  a home, giving their  children  a  good\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these needs are still important today, economic success\r\n\r\nhas  added  a  new dimension to society's needs and aspirations.\r\n\r\nThere  are many in society who are no longer satisfied with  the\r\n\r\nmere  pursuit of material gains.  They aspire towards  something\r\n\r\nmore  and,  that is, a sense of belonging in society.   Part  of\r\n\r\nthat  aspiration would include that of having a say  in  policy,\r\n\r\nparticularly those policies which affect their lives as citizens\r\n\r\nof this country.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that our population, particularly the\r\n\r\nyoung,  are  now more highly educated.  We have made significant\r\n\r\nstrides  in  education  since the 1970s.   The  entry  ratio  of\r\n\r\npolytechnic students increased from 2% in 1965 to 37%  in  1995.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the entry ratio of university students increased from\r\n\r\n4%  to  20% during the same period.  Therefore, we find that  of\r\n\r\nthose  aged  15  to 39, 72% of the workforce now have  secondary\r\n\r\nlevel  education and above and soon 60% of those  in  their  20s\r\n\r\nwould have tertiary level education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is that globalisation, including access to\r\n\r\ninformation  via the Internet, has created greater awareness  of\r\n\r\nthe    larger   socio-political   environment   internationally,\r\n\r\nregionally  and  domestically.   As  a  result  of  these  three\r\n\r\nfactors, there are more and more in Singapore society today  who\r\n\r\nare interested in public policy, have an opinion on these issues\r\n\r\nand  want to have a say.  They may not necessarily be interested\r\n\r\nin  joining  a political party per se.  But they hold  the  view\r\n\r\nthat,  as  citizens of Singapore, they should be  concerned  and\r\n\r\nthat  this concern should be expressed by speaking up on  public\r\n\r\npolicy  issues.   Some  of these views may  be  frivolous,  some\r\n\r\ncriticise  for criticism's sake.  But there are also some  which\r\n\r\nare  sincere and well-thought-through in their views.   Although\r\n\r\nsome  in  this  group would insist that they are right  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  wrong, many would consider  it  sufficient  that\r\n\r\nthere  be serious engagement.  They wish that they be given  the\r\n\r\nspace to express their views, critical or complimentary, without\r\n\r\nfear  of  retribution  that  these views  be  heard,  given  due\r\n\r\nconsideration and that the merits and demerits of these views be\r\n\r\nobjectively   and   rationally  debated  in   public,   in   the\r\n\r\nintellectual marketplace of ideas and may the best idea win.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the supply of mechanism for public policy\r\n\r\ndiscourse?  The number of channels has increased in recent years\r\n\r\nand  more  effective use has been made of them as  well.   These\r\n\r\ninclude  the grassroots organisations, such as the RCs and  CCCs\r\n\r\nunder  the People's Association, the recently expanded  Feedback\r\n\r\nUnit, the Ministries' specific committees and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngroups,  formal  and informal, established for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nconsultation  and  feedback.  There are in addition  other  more\r\n\r\ngeneral dialogue sessions, for example, the two recent occasions\r\n\r\nwhere   the   Prime   Minister  met   young   Singaporeans   and\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  respectively.  In  addition  to  the  Government\r\n\r\nchannels, there has also been more active use of the Forum  page\r\n\r\nof  The  Straits Times as a channel for expression and feedback.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  I may say so, the Institute of Policy Studies, where  I\r\n\r\nwork, has, as its objectives, the twin role of furthering public\r\n\r\npolicy discussion by means of research and conferences and being\r\n\r\na bridge builder among the various sectors of Singapore society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then do I know if there are now more channels for\r\n\r\nconsultation and feedback if there is still an excess demand?  I\r\n\r\nwill  be  the first to admit that I have no statistics, no  hard\r\n\r\nand  fast  evidence.   But  when one hears  the  dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nregarding  the existing situation repeated over and over  again,\r\n\r\ndifferent forums by different people, then surely it amounts  to\r\n\r\nmore  than  just a passing fancy or a temporary phase.   And  if\r\n\r\nanything  else,  this dissatisfaction seems to have  intensified\r\n\r\nand  not  diminished over the years.  It would appear that  this\r\n\r\ndemand  is  strongest among the professionals  and  the  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration.   It  may  not  be  a  major  concern  of  the   HDB\r\n\r\nheartlanders.   But with education, this demand will  strengthen\r\n\r\nand not diminish.  All over Asia, economic well-being has led to\r\n\r\nthe  emergence  of a middle class that is better educated,  more\r\n\r\nsocially and politically aware and more demanding of a voice  in\r\n\r\nwhat  affects them.  There is no reason why Singapore should  be\r\n\r\nso different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament, mainly comprising the people's representatives,\r\n\r\nis  the key institution for the conduct of public policy debate.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, this is already happening today.  When the elected MPs\r\n\r\nspeak,  they  often  represent the  views  of  their  respective\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  However, there can be better use of  Parliament\r\n\r\nas  an institution for public debate on policy issues of current\r\n\r\ninterest.   In  other words, in addition to passing  legislation\r\n\r\nwhich is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  itself a primary responsibility of Parliament, it  would  be\r\n\r\ndesirable for Parliament to be used even more as a major channel\r\n\r\nfor policy discussion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Policy issues range from the strategic and national to the\r\n\r\nspecific  and municipal.  I would like to see greater discussion\r\n\r\nof  major  policy changes in Parliament when they are announced.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  currently  occurring  is  that  Backbenchers  use  the\r\n\r\nCommittee of Supply debates as the main occasion for bringing up\r\n\r\nissues  under the specific Ministry cut.  But why lump them  all\r\n\r\ntogether at one sitting and not discuss these policies when they\r\n\r\nare hot off the press?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is there are many changes in educational policy\r\n\r\nwhich  have  occurred in recent years.  Many of  these  are  not\r\n\r\nmerely refinements of the system but represent systemic changes,\r\n\r\nindeed,  a major rethinking of the very philosophy of education.\r\n\r\nOne  such  example  is the recent announcement  on  The  Desired\r\n\r\nOutcomes of Education.  At all stages of the educational  system\r\n\r\n-  tertiary,  junior college, secondary, primary - this  set  of\r\n\r\nDesired Outcomes will be used to assess the performance  of  our\r\n\r\nformal  education system.  I would have liked to see this  major\r\n\r\npolicy change brought to the House for debate, not because I  do\r\n\r\nnot  agree with The Desired Outcomes, in fact, I was glad to see\r\n\r\nthe list, but because such a major policy deserves public airing\r\n\r\nand   discussion.   Such  public  discussion  allows  for   good\r\n\r\nsuggestions  to be taken on board for future policy  refinement,\r\n\r\nand  concern  and misconceptions to be clarified.   One  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich this could be done would be for a motion to be moved,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  \"That  the  House endorses  The  Desired  Outcomes  of\r\n\r\nEducation.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second and related proposal is that the Government\r\n\r\nParliamentary Committees (GPCs) play a more active role in  such\r\n\r\npublic  policy  discussions.  For example,  the  motion  on  The\r\n\r\nDesired  Outcomes  could be moved by a Member  of  the  GPC  for\r\n\r\nEducation.   In  fact,  the GPCs already are  utilised  to  some\r\n\r\nextent  in  this  manner.  GPCs could be  utilised  to  get  the\r\n\r\nfeedback  on these major policy changes.  These views  could  be\r\n\r\naired in the House\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nduring  the  policy  debate.  This  is  already  the  case,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  during the Budget debate when the Members of  the  GPC\r\n\r\nfor Finance and Trade and Industry bring to the attention of the\r\n\r\nHouse  the  feedback  which  they  obtained  from  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity.  The system of debating major policy changes  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse  has  been done on occasions in the past.  I  recall  that\r\n\r\nmotions   were  moved  in  the  case  of  the  benchmarking   of\r\n\r\nMinisterial salaries with the private sector in 1994 and for the\r\n\r\nsecond  Cost Review Committee Report in 1996.  However,  what  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  propose is that every major  policy  change  be\r\n\r\ndebated  in the House and that the GPCs play an active  role  in\r\n\r\nthis discussion by gathering feedback and moving the motion.  If\r\n\r\nnecessary, if it calls for a serious policy change in debate,  a\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper could be prepared, for example, in the case of  the\r\n\r\nMinisterial salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where specific and municipal policy issues are concerned,\r\n\r\nQuestion  Time  should suffice.  However, the one hour  allotted\r\n\r\nfor  Questions for Oral Answer is, in my opinion, too short  for\r\n\r\nall  such  matters  to  be raised.  The  frustration  that  some\r\n\r\nMembers  experience is that there is insufficient time  for  all\r\n\r\nQuestions to be answered as occurred today.  There is of  course\r\n\r\nthe alternative of a Written Question.  But an answer in written\r\n\r\nform does not permit the Member to seek further clarification on\r\n\r\nthe  spot  and to wait for another month for further elaboration\r\n\r\nwould  really be too long a delay.  My third proposal  therefore\r\n\r\nis  that  Question  Time be lengthened to 1\ufffd hours.   One  could\r\n\r\nargue that even this is insufficient.  But a 50% increase is, in\r\n\r\nmy view, a major improvement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two additional aspects of the public consultation\r\n\r\nprocess that I would like to discuss.  The first is that we need\r\n\r\nto  establish ground rules for this public discourse.   I  fully\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  elected  Members  will  make  statements  with\r\n\r\npolitical  objectives in mind.  That is the essence of politics.\r\n\r\nBut  we  should make every effort to debate in an objective  and\r\n\r\nrational manner.  At times, the debate can and should be robust,\r\n\r\neven  heated.   But such engagements should not be personal  and\r\n\r\nshould not be taken personally.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect which I would like to discuss is public as\r\n\r\nopposed  to  private consultation and feedback.  I believe  that\r\n\r\nthere is room for both.  There are occasions when the Government\r\n\r\nwould  gather feedback on a private basis away from  the  public\r\n\r\neye.   This  is  particularly the case  when  providers  of  the\r\n\r\nfeedback  may not wish to be identified with the point  made  or\r\n\r\nthat  confidentiality of the policy is crucial, for example,  in\r\n\r\nformulating  the Budget.  But public consultation  and  feedback\r\n\r\nis,  I  believe, becoming increasingly important.  And it is  in\r\n\r\nthe latter case that Parliament can be more effectively used  as\r\n\r\na channel for such debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to discuss briefly my views on the first part\r\n\r\nof  the motion, that of a less adversarial Parliament.  I do not\r\n\r\nbelieve  that our present system is adversarial.  I  agree  with\r\n\r\nthe  Member  who  spoke just now on this matter.   If  anything,\r\n\r\napart from a few isolated incidents, Parliament is conducted  in\r\n\r\na  very  civil manner.  The expression of differences of opinion\r\n\r\nshould   not,   in   my   mind,   be   considered   adversarial.\r\n\r\nParliamentary  debates  should be encouraged  to  emphasise  the\r\n\r\nobjective  to  give  all, and especially  the  best  ideas,  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to be heard.  While I agree that I would not like to\r\n\r\nsee a situation where there are fist-fights and hair-pulling  in\r\n\r\nParliament, I also do not envisage that this situation is likely\r\n\r\nto  arise in this House in the near future.  Hence, while  I  am\r\n\r\nfully  supportive that the motion should be debated in the House\r\n\r\nand  for which reason I have supported the motion to be debated,\r\n\r\nand  I  am  also  fully supportive of the second clause  of  the\r\n\r\nmotion, I am unable to give my full support to the first  clause\r\n\r\nregarding the less adversarial system of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, allow me to reiterate my argument. The\r\n\r\ntelescoping  of  the  economic growth process  in  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nunprecedented  in  world  history.   What  took  the   developed\r\n\r\ncountries  60 to 70 years to achieve, Singapore has achieved  in\r\n\r\n30  years, half that time.  However, while the economic hardware\r\n\r\nand  the  material  side have developed rapidly,  the  software,\r\n\r\nincluding social and political institutions, has been slower  to\r\n\r\nevolve.  As a result,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  believe that there is this disequilibrium situation of excess\r\n\r\ndemand  where public policy discussion is concerned and,  hence,\r\n\r\nin   this  context,  I  believe  that  Parliament  can  be  more\r\n\r\neffectively  used  as a major channel for such consultation  and\r\n\r\nfeedback.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, let me commend Mr Rai for moving\r\n\r\nthis  motion  and Dr Lee for supporting him.  Both  have  indeed\r\n\r\nmade very illuminating speeches in this pretty late hour.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  we  agree  with much of what they say.   And  I  must  say\r\n\r\npersonally  that there are parts which I do not agree.   I  will\r\n\r\ntalk  about the parts which I agree first and, later on, I  will\r\n\r\nexplain the parts which I do not agree.  When I get to that part\r\n\r\nof  my speech, I hope that he can understand my explanation  and\r\n\r\naccept  what  I  say  and  agree with  me,  then  we  can  reach\r\n\r\nconsensus.  Even if he does not want to agree with me and  there\r\n\r\nis no consensus, I hope he will not consider me as an adversary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Certainly not, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Neither will I be adversarial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we inherited the British Westminster system of\r\n\r\ngovernment and made it work.  Mr Rai rightly observed  just  now\r\n\r\nand he quoted examples of many other countries, particularly the\r\n\r\nex-British  colonies, which tried and failed.  Indeed,  many  of\r\n\r\nthese  ex-colonies went through many constitutions  since  their\r\n\r\nindependence, from a parliamentary system of government  with  a\r\n\r\nPrime Minister to a Presidential system, then military coup  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  a  Presidential form of government, maybe another  coup\r\n\r\nagain, and so on and so forth.  I think we can see quite  a  few\r\n\r\nof these examples in Africa, even today.  And there is no end to\r\n\r\nthe  problem  for  them.  But Singapore  has  succeeded  so  far\r\n\r\nbecause  we are willing to adapt and evolve the system  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  inherited according to the changing social  and  political\r\n\r\ncircumstances  and according to the imperatives  of  our  multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-religious society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we did not modify our electoral system, say, in 1988, today,\r\n\r\nwe  would  not  have  GRCs and perhaps we would  have  an  under\r\n\r\nrepresentation of minority races in this Parliament.  And if, in\r\n\r\n1984,  we had listened to Mr Jeyaretnam and agreed with him  not\r\n\r\nto  have  the  NCMP system, then we would not see Mr  Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nhere today, and we would not have the NCMP system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in 1984 and even before that, the Government envisaged\r\n\r\nthat some of our people may want to see more heat and debate  in\r\n\r\nParliament.   They  wanted  to see the Opposition  heckling  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  criticising it, commenting on its policies  and  so\r\n\r\non.    That   is  why  in  1984,  the  Government  amended   the\r\n\r\nConstitution and also our Parliamentary Elections Act to provide\r\n\r\nfor  the NCMP scheme.  So we have the NCMP here today because  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think you can find anywhere else in the world  that  an\r\n\r\nopposition, having contested in an election and lost, can find a\r\n\r\nplace  in  Parliament to criticise the very party  that  it  was\r\n\r\nopposing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, had the Opposition parties been really effective in the\r\n\r\nlast  17  years   Mr Jeyaretnam came to Parliament in  1981,  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  was elected in 1984 and Mr Jeyaretnam re-elected in  1984\r\n\r\ntoday we would not have NMPs sitting in this House and giving us\r\n\r\nsuggestions,  constructive advice and the various  contributions\r\n\r\nthey have made in our debates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee's analogy of supply and demand in economics is very\r\n\r\ninteresting.  Indeed, I fully agree with her that there is  some\r\n\r\npressure  in  some quarters for more discourse on public  policy\r\n\r\nand  therefore more people may want to speak up.   In  my  basic\r\n\r\nunderstanding of economics, I thought there is a  way  to  clear\r\n\r\nthe supply and demand, and that is the price mechanism.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nin  politics, some people may think that there is no price to be\r\n\r\npaid  to  be  in Parliament.  I think there is.  If  people  are\r\n\r\nreally keen on a public discourse in Parliament, then the  price\r\n\r\nto  be  paid is to contest in the elections.  Win the  election,\r\n\r\nand then they can be in Parliament and, hopefully, contribute to\r\n\r\nthe debates in this Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they do not want to, we have the NMP scheme and it has found\r\n\r\na  way  for people, to contribute to public policy discourse  in\r\n\r\nParliament.  But that does not mean that if other people want to\r\n\r\nmake  their  views  heard and do not want to be  in  Parliament,\r\n\r\nthere  is no place at all to make their views heard.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany  channels which I will elaborate.  In fact, the two Members\r\n\r\nhave  talked  about  how people who want to  comment  on  public\r\n\r\npolicy could do so earlier on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is a price. In fact, there is even a price for the\r\n\r\nelectorate for that matter.  If the electorate really feels that\r\n\r\nthere is a strong demand for some voices to be heard which  will\r\n\r\nbe  a counter to what the Government would do or that Government\r\n\r\npolicies were not to their liking, then the price they pay would\r\n\r\nbe to vote in the opposition.  Then they would have a new party,\r\n\r\nnew  government, and that is it.  If they do not want to pay too\r\n\r\nmuch of a price, then they vote in some Opposition Members.  But\r\n\r\nI  think it is very difficult for the electorate to arrange  for\r\n\r\nthat.   So,  happily, the PAP has been elected time  and  again,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  people really want the PAP to be  the  government,\r\n\r\nalthough  they  do  want some Opposition voices  in  Parliament.\r\n\r\nThat  is how Mr Jeyaretnam found his way into Parliament because\r\n\r\nof  some  unhappiness at that time in Anson, and we  had  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir and subsequently at other places.  And today, we are  back\r\n\r\nto  two  elected Opposition Members.  I think people  knew  what\r\n\r\nelected Opposition Members can really do in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Rai rightly also observed that we have built up a\r\n\r\npolitical system that is honest and free from corruption.  But I\r\n\r\nthink we should not forget that this was not the situation  that\r\n\r\nprevailed  in  Singapore in the 1950s or even up  to  the  early\r\n\r\n1960s.  I remember, as a young boy, I followed my mother to  the\r\n\r\nSiong Lim market in Jalan Besar.  My mother used to tell me that\r\n\r\nif  a hawker inspector in the 1950s needed food provisions, then\r\n\r\nall  that  person needed to do was to drive his car to the  back\r\n\r\nlane of the market, leave his car unlocked and come back to find\r\n\r\nhis car filled with provisions and his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarketing  needs for the week.  That was how it was.  Corruption\r\n\r\nwas  rife  from  the  top and all the way down  to  very  junior\r\n\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have more or less, in fact, I would say almost, eradicated\r\n\r\nthis problem.  But if we look around us, I think it seems to  be\r\n\r\nquite natural to have corruption.  And here in Singapore, we are\r\n\r\nlucky  that we have worked at it and made sure that this  system\r\n\r\ndoes  not  prevail and we must continue to work hard to preserve\r\n\r\nthis value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai is also right to say that it is not the Constitution or\r\n\r\nany  law  that  determines  the  success  of  our  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.   Indeed,  it  is not any law  or  constitution  that\r\n\r\ndetermines  the  success of any institution.   It  is  not  just\r\n\r\nParliament.   We  need  people  who  are  honest,  people   with\r\n\r\nintegrity, people with the nation's interest at heart, in  order\r\n\r\nto make sure that we have a good and clean system.  So no number\r\n\r\nof  independent commissions of inquiry or independent council or\r\n\r\nOmbudsman  will  make sure that we will have a good,  clean  and\r\n\r\ncorrupt-free system.  No, not at all.  But if the Workers' Party\r\n\r\nwere  to be in charge today, I think we would have lots of that.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Mr Jeyaretnam is not here to hear this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our system, we recognise people with ability. In this\r\n\r\nmeritocratic  system,   we  reward  them  according   to   their\r\n\r\nperformance and they get promoted and hence they move  up.   And\r\n\r\nthat  is the social ladder that we provide for all Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nie, the equal opportunity that we provide in our system, and  we\r\n\r\nhave  done that.  We have seen many examples of people who  have\r\n\r\nmoved  up  from the lower rungs of society to high positions  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  or  in the private sector.  I think there  are  also\r\n\r\nmany  examples of these people in this House.  So I  think  this\r\n\r\nsystem has worked and we must ensure that it continues to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai said that the younger generation of Singaporeans may want\r\n\r\nto  emulate the Western style of democracy.  Well, I  have  just\r\n\r\nrecounted some examples of how some restless electorate wants to\r\n\r\nsee an Opposition in Parliament.  But I think\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmost  Singaporeans are sensible.  They are rational.  They  know\r\n\r\nwhat it is at stake and what is in their interest.  And that  is\r\n\r\nwhy  even  though they may want to have heated debates  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  they  know that they cannot just have  people  here  who\r\n\r\nwould criticise or make comments without really contributing  to\r\n\r\nthe formulation of good policies.  But during an election rally,\r\n\r\nI  am  sure Members know that in the last election, for example,\r\n\r\nthousands  of people turned up at election rallies to listen  to\r\n\r\nthe Opposition attack and criticise the Government, poked fun at\r\n\r\nthe Government, our policies and so on.  I think the people just\r\n\r\nlapped  it  up.   They  enjoyed it.   They  went  there  for  an\r\n\r\nentertainment  and at the end of the day, when they  cast  their\r\n\r\nvote, they know what is at stake when they give that vote to the\r\n\r\nperson whom they voted for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That reminds me of another part of my young childhood. I used\r\n\r\nto  enjoy going to the street corner and watch at the koyok man,\r\n\r\nthe Chinese medicine man, showing off his skills like swallowing\r\n\r\nsteel  ball-bearings.  Or he may have an iron rod  to  poke  his\r\n\r\nneck until it bends, and he also carried a drum.  At the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  day, he would say, \"This is my koyok.   This is my medicine\r\n\r\nthat can really make you feel good.  And if something happens to\r\n\r\nyou,  this can be a palliative to your problems.\"  I think  many\r\n\r\npeople  went  there for a good show, enjoyed  it  and  some  may\r\n\r\nsympathise with the guy because he would pass his hat round  and\r\n\r\nthey  would  just  drop some coins in there.   And  some  people\r\n\r\nactually bought that story and bought the koyok.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is like election rallies. People turned up at election\r\n\r\nrallies,  listened to the speeches, enjoyed and lapped them  up.\r\n\r\nThey went home, quite happy, but when they cast their vote, they\r\n\r\ndid  not buy that story.  But still, about a quarter, maybe 30%,\r\n\r\nmaybe  more in some cases, of those people who turned  up  there\r\n\r\nbought  that  story.   They  did buy that  koyok  of  Opposition\r\n\r\nspeakers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai, Dr Lee and Mr Sin Boon Ann talked about the various\r\n\r\nchannels that we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  opened up in the last many years to allow people to  speak\r\n\r\nup  and  to contribute to our nation building, to contribute  to\r\n\r\nour  policy formulation and so on.  Indeed, there have been many\r\n\r\nsuch mechanisms and channels and we can, of course, open up more\r\n\r\nif  people want it.  And the latest one is the S21 Committee  in\r\n\r\nwhich two Members here are actively participating and others too\r\n\r\nhave  been  asked whether they have views and whether there  are\r\n\r\npeople  who may have views and who may be interested  in  taking\r\n\r\npart  in  the  dialogues.  And all these  channels  are  outside\r\n\r\nParliament  and certainly people are most welcome  to  give  all\r\n\r\ntheir  views.  During the 1985 recession, we formed an  Economic\r\n\r\nCommittee  in 1986 to look into the measures that we  needed  to\r\n\r\ntake  and  to devise a new economic strategy for Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans took part in it.  Now, we also have a similar\r\n\r\ncommittee   and  again  a  lot  of  Singaporeans  are  involved.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  the various committees and councils we have  had  in\r\n\r\n1988, 1989, 1991, for example, to write up the Agenda for Action\r\n\r\nor The Next Lap or the various Advisory Councils' Reports on the\r\n\r\nAged, on Youth, on Culture, etc, have involved lots and lots  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  And those were not just reports studied and filed\r\n\r\naway, and left to dry on the shelf.   They were reports prepared\r\n\r\nby  earnest  and  serious  people who had  spent  time  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had also spent a lot of time going through  each  of\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations.   Eventually, when  these  recommendations\r\n\r\nwere  adopted, we spent money implementing them.   And,  indeed,\r\n\r\ntoday,  you  see the results of many of these suggestions  which\r\n\r\nhave been implemented by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, as the Prime Minister said last year, he wanted more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to participate and there are channels for  them  to\r\n\r\ndo  so.  Mr Rai has quoted the Prime Minister and I shall not go\r\n\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these measures that we have taken are really for the\r\n\r\ngood  governance of Singapore.  I do not agree with Mr Rai  when\r\n\r\nhe said that we have been subjected to heavy criticisms from the\r\n\r\nWestern  press  or media on our system of governance.   I  think\r\n\r\nnot.   Indeed, they have praised us, not that we need the praise\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe want the praise in order to do a good job.  But people looked\r\n\r\nat  our system when they came here, and they went away and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Yes,  this  is a serious place.  This is a place  where  people\r\n\r\nmake  decisions  based on rational arguments and they  implement\r\n\r\nwhat  they  say.\"   So  they went away and said  the  system  of\r\n\r\ngovernance  here  is correct and I think we should  continue  to\r\n\r\nuphold the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of whether there is an opposition in Parliament\r\n\r\nor not, the PAP Government will continue to devise policies with\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the people at heart.  It is not a  question  of\r\n\r\nstaying  in  power.  If it is so, we will not have  devised  the\r\n\r\nElected  President  system, for example,  to  check  our  power.\r\n\r\nWhere  in the world can you find a ruling Government devising  a\r\n\r\nsystem  to  check  its own power?  But we  did  it,  because  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  it is in the interest of Singaporeans  that,  who\r\n\r\nknows,  some  day  a profligate government may be  elected  into\r\n\r\npower  and  it just squanders away all the hard earned  reserves\r\n\r\nthat we have accumulated over the years.  So we should now start\r\n\r\na  process to ensure that the reserves that we have would not be\r\n\r\nsquandered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai quoted the example of the judiciary system and asked\r\n\r\nus to take a leaf from it.  He said that since the judiciary has\r\n\r\nevolved  and  been  made  less adversarial,  it  has  been  more\r\n\r\nconsultative  and it allows mediation and conciliation,  and  so\r\n\r\non,  Parliament  should follow suit.  I think  there  is  a  big\r\n\r\ndifference  between what the judiciary does and what  Parliament\r\n\r\ndoes.   What the judiciary does is that it settles disputes  for\r\n\r\nparties.   If  there is no dispute between parties, then  nobody\r\n\r\nneeds  to  go to the courts.   But because there is  a  dispute,\r\n\r\nwhether it is a dispute between an individual and an individual,\r\n\r\nor an individual against a corporation, or a corporation against\r\n\r\na  corporation,  or even a corporation against  the  Government,\r\n\r\nthey need a third party to help settle the dispute.  Before they\r\n\r\neventually   go  to  court,  they  get  into   a    process   of\r\n\r\nconsultation, mediation or conciliation on the points that  they\r\n\r\nagree, and the parts for which they cannot agree, the judge will\r\n\r\nlisten  to  both  sides  of the story and  eventually  give  his\r\n\r\ndecision and verdict.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the role of Parliament and the role of the Government are\r\n\r\nvery  different.  It is a not a question of dispute between  the\r\n\r\nopposition  and  the PAP.  It is a question  of  the  Government\r\n\r\nsetting  out  policies and implementing them, or the  Government\r\n\r\npresenting Bills to be passed in Parliament into law and  having\r\n\r\na  full debate of these, and eventually the legislature decides,\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is the kind of law we should have\".  Parliament votes\r\n\r\non  the  Bills, and we implement them, and the court  will  then\r\n\r\ninterpret those laws.  At the end of the term, it is the  people\r\n\r\nwho  will decide whether this Government has done well  or  not.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  for Mr Speaker or Mr Deputy Speaker to  say,  \"Good\r\n\r\npolicy.  I approve or disapprove, or I reject it, or this is  my\r\n\r\ndecision.\"   No.   It is for the people.  The people  will  give\r\n\r\nthat verdict.  So it is very different from the judiciary and we\r\n\r\ntherefore   cannot  emulate  the  judiciary   in   following   a\r\n\r\nconsultative, mediatory, conciliatory approach to our  disputes.\r\n\r\nBecause  that  is actually not a dispute between the  Government\r\n\r\nand  the  opposition.   It is a question of  different  policies\r\n\r\nwhich I will touch on afterwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in our Parliament, the way we have conducted our\r\n\r\nbusiness  has  been well reported.  Not that  we  need  to  seek\r\n\r\naccolades,  but  Members  may have  read  of  these  reports  by\r\n\r\nconsultants and other international agencies.  My colleague, the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  quoted PERC, IMD, WEF Reports,  etc.   They\r\n\r\nspeak  very well of our Parliament. I would not want to take  up\r\n\r\ntoo  much  of  Members'  time but let me just  quote  one  short\r\n\r\npassage from what PERC said in their survey in July last year:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The standard of debate [ie, in Parliament] is arguably\r\n\r\nmuch  better than in many countries in Asia.  In fact, by rating\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  legislature as the  best   in  the  region,  the\r\n\r\nrespondents [these are businessmen] in our survey appear  to  be\r\n\r\nsaying  that  these  factors [earlier on it talked  about  other\r\n\r\nfactors such as the quality of the police and the quality of our\r\n\r\njudiciary] were more important to them than the lack of a strong\r\n\r\nopposition able to act as a check on the government.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sometimes, PAP backbenchers also play the role of a de\r\n\r\nfacto  political opposition, bringing up issues  that  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries  would fall more naturally within the purview  of  the\r\n\r\ngovernment's opponents.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what is said of this House. So we conduct our\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  a  dignified  and  business-like  manner  and   in\r\n\r\nseriousness, not one where, as the Member has observed in  other\r\n\r\ncountries, slippers, shoes, or even water guns are being  thrown\r\n\r\nor fired at one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai specifically talked about the contempt or public\r\n\r\nperception that some PAP Members have on the opposition.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot  agree with that.  We cannot give respect to a person unless\r\n\r\nthat person really earns it.  So respect has to be earned.   Has\r\n\r\nsuccess  got  into our heads or not, just because we  have  been\r\n\r\nreturned  overwhelmingly by the people?   I  think  not.   After\r\n\r\nevery general election, the Prime Minister will invariably  send\r\n\r\na  letter  to  all the PAP MPs (he is responsible only  for  PAP\r\n\r\nMPs),  and  he  will remind them of what their  responsibilities\r\n\r\nare.   Let me quote from a letter which he wrote to all the  PAP\r\n\r\nMPs  on  9th January 1997 after the last general elections.   He\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Victory must not go into our heads. The responsibilities\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  shoulder  require us to be humble,  not  arrogant.\r\n\r\nReach  out to all your constituents, work hard to win over those\r\n\r\nwho  did  not  support you this time.  Seek to understand  their\r\n\r\naspirations  and  their  difficulties.  Address  their  concerns\r\n\r\nwhere  you can and meet their needs for better local facilities.\r\n\r\nConsolidate  your  position by working harder  and  winning  the\r\n\r\nconfidence and trust.  Start working now.  For the next  general\r\n\r\nelection in 2002, use the next five years to show what we can do\r\n\r\nto make our people's lives better.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all our PAP MPs know their responsibilities. In fact,\r\n\r\nwe  have always told the people and even the opposition that  we\r\n\r\ndo  not just prepare for the next election just before or during\r\n\r\nthe nine days of the campaign.  We prepare for the next election\r\n\r\nthe very day we win our last general election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai suggested that one way to help us evolve into a less\r\n\r\nadversarial   Parliament  is  to  consult  the   opposition   in\r\n\r\nParliament  whenever  major policies are discussed.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nagree with that.  I will tell him why. Parliament is not a forum\r\n\r\nor  a  conference  room  where we host seminars  and  dialogues.\r\n\r\nThere  we  can  exchange  views.  We can  have  IPS,  Roundtable\r\n\r\ndiscussions,  Socrates' Circle, or we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan  have  \"Time  Square  Society\",  whatever  it  is  for  such\r\n\r\npurposes.   But  Parliament is not this  kind  of  organisation.\r\n\r\nParliament is a serious place.  It is a place where MPs who  are\r\n\r\nelected  by the people come and contribute to policy making  and\r\n\r\nfor them to scrutinise the policies.  These include the PAP MPs.\r\n\r\nThey  will  scrutinise Government policies and  make  sure  that\r\n\r\nthese policies are good for the people and the nation and in our\r\n\r\ninterest.  After winning every election, the party in power,  in\r\n\r\nthis case the PAP, will put forth its policies and programmes to\r\n\r\nseek the support of the legislature so that eventually when they\r\n\r\nare implemented, it will win again at the next election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the role of the opposition here? The role of the\r\n\r\nopposition  in  Parliament will be to  poke  holes,  maybe  even\r\n\r\nworse, to criticise and to tear down all these policies that  we\r\n\r\nwant  to implement, or even to question the very need for  these\r\n\r\npolicies.  That is their role.  They will attack us.  If they do\r\n\r\nnot  do their job, and if they support us, reach consensus  with\r\n\r\nus,  then  they are not  the opposition.  So the very nature  of\r\n\r\nparty  politics that we have inherited, even so in Britain  now,\r\n\r\nwill  ensure that the proceedings in this House will  always  be\r\n\r\nadversarial.   There is no running away from that.   We  can  be\r\n\r\ncivil.  But civil does not mean that we will not be adversarial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, if Members look back at the Hansard in the 50s and early\r\n\r\n60s  when  we had an opposition, there were far more  bickerings\r\n\r\nand  noisy and nasty debates in this House.  As Mr Rai said, the\r\n\r\nopposition,  even  till  today, will  oppose  for  the  sake  of\r\n\r\nopposition, not just because the policy is no good, but even  if\r\n\r\nthe  policy  is good, it will also oppose it.  So  there  is  no\r\n\r\nreason  why the PAP Government should consult the opposition  in\r\n\r\nthis House whenever we discuss our policies.  The only place and\r\n\r\ntime  to  really debate policies is when the House  debates  the\r\n\r\nBills,  motions  or  statements.  Then both sides  can  properly\r\n\r\nscrutinise these statements or policies and argue their case and\r\n\r\ntry  to  convince  each other, if not, at  least  definitely  to\r\n\r\nconvince the electorate that \"my view is better than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyours\".  That is the nature of party politics.  There is no  way\r\n\r\nthat we can avoid being adversarial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, even if we want to consult them, I do not think\r\n\r\nthere is much that we can get out of them because they are  just\r\n\r\nbereft  of  ideas.  We heard more than an hour of Mr  Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nraking up an old issue.  He was so predictable.  If you listened\r\n\r\nto Prof. Ho Peng Kee, you know that he has got a speech prepared\r\n\r\nand  all  the  points that Mr Jeyaretnam brought  up  have  been\r\n\r\nanticipated.   He was so predictable that we know  what  he  was\r\n\r\ngoing to say.  So there were no surprises.  What is new from the\r\n\r\nopposition?  We know that there would not be anything new.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, should we only consult the three opposition Members\r\n\r\nhere,  or  two  elected  ones?  Should we?  Are  they  the  only\r\n\r\nopposition voices in Singapore?  Certainly not.  Because we have\r\n\r\nthe  PKMS, the SDP, the NSP and many others. Since they are also\r\n\r\nthe  opposition,  should the Government also not  consult  these\r\n\r\nopposition  parties in order to carry consensus seeking  to  the\r\n\r\nextreme?   It  seems logical to do so.  But I do  not  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  do  so.  Because, in the first place, these people  have\r\n\r\nnot  earned their place here.  Secondly, even when they are  out\r\n\r\nthere,  I do not think they can even look after themselves.  For\r\n\r\nexample, where is the SDP now?  They had three Members  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse before the last election.  Two were not re-elected because\r\n\r\ntheir  performance in the previous five years had shown up their\r\n\r\nperformance  in  this House as well as in their  constituencies.\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam left the SDP long before the election and today he  is\r\n\r\nstill  here,  of  course,  but  he has  another  party,  another\r\n\r\nplatform, another organisation.  But what about the rest?   Some\r\n\r\ncannot  even  look  after their own affairs,  what  about  being\r\n\r\nconsulted  on national affairs.  I think it is not fair  to  put\r\n\r\nthat burden on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, if there are any contributions or improvements to\r\n\r\nbe  made  to policies, the opposition should make them  here  in\r\n\r\nthis  House.  Then we can debate and reach the best conclusions.\r\n\r\nIf their views are constructive, useful and relevant, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  acknowledge, accept and implement  them.   But\r\n\r\nmost  of the time, I would say practically all the time, we will\r\n\r\nnot  find  a  shred of it that is useful.  Some of them  may  be\r\n\r\nhelpful  in  setting us thinking about how to overcome  some  of\r\n\r\ntheir  problems or some of their objections.   But we know  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  not got the slightest idea as to how  to  make  this\r\n\r\nplace  better.  I also do not think the opposition parties  will\r\n\r\nhelp  reach consensus in this House.  Because, by doing so, they\r\n\r\ncome to agreement with us, and they will diminish their role and\r\n\r\nthe  electorate will say, \"No use having the opposition  because\r\n\r\nthey always agree with the PAP.\"  What about the PAP?  Supposing\r\n\r\nthe PAP were to agree with the opposition all the time, then the\r\n\r\npeople will say, \"Why do we need the PAP?  I might as well  vote\r\n\r\nfor  the opposition.\"  But let me assure Members that that would\r\n\r\nnot be the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, if we have a debate on, say, a Bill that goes to a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee, I think the proceedings of those debates  will\r\n\r\nbe  less adversarial, which opposition MPs and even PAP MPs will\r\n\r\nconcede, because they are outside for the scrutiny of the public\r\n\r\nand  the media.  But the moment we have the public sitting  here\r\n\r\nin  the gallery and the press reporting this event, I think both\r\n\r\nsides,  the  opposition  and  the Government,  will  give  their\r\n\r\ncontending views and eventually try to convince the public  that\r\n\r\ntheir  view is much better.  This is what party politics is  all\r\n\r\nabout.   It is inherent in our system because different  parties\r\n\r\nhave  different ideas, different ideals, different policies  and\r\n\r\ndifferent  programmes.  Indeed, if they are not different,  then\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  no party politics to speak of.  The  layout  of\r\n\r\nthese seats, for example, already shows that we are adversarial.\r\n\r\nNow,  of  course, I do not want to be adversarial with  you  but\r\n\r\nthat is the origin of it.  It is adversarial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards other suggestions by Mr Rai to enlarge the NCMP\r\n\r\nscheme  or  have  some percentage of this House  be  elected  by\r\n\r\nproportional  representation, I think  they  are  not  workable,\r\n\r\nespecially  if  his  intention is to  have  a  less  adversarial\r\n\r\nParliament.   Just one example of an NCMP, we know  that  it  is\r\n\r\nalready very adversarial.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nImagine  if we have more NCMPs in this House, I think  the  mood\r\n\r\nand atmosphere in this House will be much more adversarial.   If\r\n\r\nwe  were  to  have a percentage of our MPs here  represented  on\r\n\r\nproportional representation, I think that will also not be  good\r\n\r\nfor  us.   Why?  Because then different cause parties, different\r\n\r\ninterest  groups,  different segments of the society  will  then\r\n\r\nform  parties  to appeal to a certain segment of the  people  in\r\n\r\norder  to  be elected in this House.  This will then  spawn  all\r\n\r\nkinds  of  groups and groupings that would not be good  for  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  our  nation.  So we should not  tinker  with  this\r\n\r\nelectoral  system that we now have.  In fact, if I look  at  the\r\n\r\ncontributions  made  by NMPs and the way they  debate  policies,\r\n\r\neven if they do not agree with the Government, I think they  are\r\n\r\nvery  constructive  and very useful.  It is  a  lesson  for  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  With their presence, I see really very little  need\r\n\r\nfor NCMPs to be here to contribute to the debate in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Sir, while I note Mr Rai's honourable intention\r\n\r\nto  make  this House less adversarial, I do not agree  with  his\r\n\r\nproposals,  particularly  the ones that  he  suggested  that  we\r\n\r\nconsult the Opposition or to enlarge the NCMP scheme or to  have\r\n\r\nproportional representation, because these will do us no good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do not support his motion in that respect. I cannot just\r\n\r\nvote  partly for it and the other part against it.  I  say  that\r\n\r\njust in case, and lest that people in future look at the Hansard\r\n\r\nthink  that  we should evolve that way and be less  adversarial.\r\n\r\nLet  us  not be misunderstood.  We simply do not agree with  his\r\n\r\napproach.  It would not happen.  The lesson from the British  is\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  been talking about having a  less  adversarial\r\n\r\nsystem  for  years.   I  went to ask the Librarian  to  help  me\r\n\r\nresearch some articles.  There were piles of articles written on\r\n\r\nthe  British  Parliament and how it is doing and how  it  serves\r\n\r\npeople's   interests  and  whether  it  should   not   be   less\r\n\r\nadversarial, etc.  Till today, after years of debate, they  have\r\n\r\nnot come to a consensus.  I do not think they will.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside Parliament, indeed, the Government will continue with\r\n\r\nits  consultation,  consensus building  process  to  get  views,\r\n\r\ncanvass  views,  feedback, suggestions, ideas from  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  want to contribute through various means, incorporate  them\r\n\r\nwherever  possible,  feasible, practicable,  and  we  will  also\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  co-opt individuals to serve in the Government,  in\r\n\r\nthe statutory boards, in our committees, in our councils, and so\r\n\r\non,  so  that  these people can also take part in the  decision-making process of the Government.  One does not have to be  part\r\n\r\nof  Government but one can be, as a private individual,  sit  in\r\n\r\nour  statutory  boards,  in our Economic Committees,  etc.,  and\r\n\r\none's  views  will  still  be valued.  So  the  Government  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to do that.  But while the Prime Minister  has  talked\r\n\r\nabout  a consultative, participative process, let us not  forget\r\n\r\nthat  when the time comes to make firm decisions because of  the\r\n\r\nurgency  of  the  matter,  because of  the  peculiarity  of  the\r\n\r\nsubject,  the  Government will not hesitate to make  these  firm\r\n\r\ndecisions without consultation with the people.  I think that is\r\n\r\nthe  duty  of  the Government, that is, to decide  in  the  best\r\n\r\ninterest  of the people and when there is no time, we just  have\r\n\r\nto  do  it, and we will do it.  In fact, that is what the people\r\n\r\nexpect of a strong, just and fair Government, which is what  the\r\n\r\nPAP is all about during the last few decades.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test of the effectiveness of this Government really, as Mr\r\n\r\nRai  suggested, is whether it has improved the living  standards\r\n\r\nof  the  people,  whether it has improved life for  the  people.\r\n\r\nWhether  Government has done well or not depends on whether  its\r\n\r\npolicies  are  good for the people, and the people will  decide.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the people decided, election after election, since  1959\r\n\r\nthat what the PAP Government did, and is doing, for them is good\r\n\r\nfor them.  And that is why we are here.  Singaporeans indeed can\r\n\r\nbe  and  are justifiably proud of the achievements of Singapore,\r\n\r\ndespite  our  size,  and Singapore does  stand  tall  among  the\r\n\r\ncommunity of nations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, concepts such as consultation,\r\n\r\nconsensus, conciliation - I heard a lot of it today -\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare good words essentially, so is the objective to evolve a less\r\n\r\nadversarial parliamentary system a desirable political end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is it a goal which everyone agrees on? For some, this\r\n\r\nmotion  may  be irrelevant because they regard Parliament  as  a\r\n\r\nvenue for vigorous debate, where adversarial relationships  are,\r\n\r\nin  fact, healthy.  Others may believe that the evolution  of  a\r\n\r\npolitical   system  should  create  a  broad  middle-ground   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  sharing  common political views  than  adversarial\r\n\r\nones,  leading  naturally to the adoption of a less  adversarial\r\n\r\nparliamentary system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whichever is the preferred approach, and I see both approaches\r\n\r\nhere, when differences of opinions do intensify and conflict  is\r\n\r\nimpending  on a particular policy, it is the government  of  the\r\n\r\nday  which makes the final decision.  So whether we have a  more\r\n\r\nadversarial  or  more consensual parliamentary system,  when  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  the  crunch, the ruling Party  -  manifested  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment - will call the shots.  This, to me, is obvious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I see the substance behind this motion is not about\r\n\r\nchanges  in the parliamentary system.  It is a call for  greater\r\n\r\ntolerance  for  different,  and  even  opposing,  views   during\r\n\r\nparliamentary debate.  Of course, there are areas of improvement\r\n\r\nwhich  can  make  this  House a more vibrant  venue  for  policy\r\n\r\ndiscourse.  I remember Dr Lily Neo in one interview said  a  lot\r\n\r\nof  consultation  and implementation, checks  and  feedback  are\r\n\r\ncarried  outside  of this House, not within this  House.   So  I\r\n\r\nthink  this  call for tolerance requires all political  parties,\r\n\r\nbig  or small, mainstream or opposition, to create space for one\r\n\r\nanother,  and  to  express  their  views  freely,  and  adopt  a\r\n\r\n\"gentlemanly\" (maybe I should say here \"lady-like\") attitude  to\r\n\r\nagree  to disagree without one having to be right and the  other\r\n\r\nto  be  wrong.  We need to recognise the world is not just black\r\n\r\nor white, but mainly shades of grey.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this consultation achieved? While there are numerous\r\n\r\ndialogues between the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment    and   the   electorate,   increasingly    educated\r\n\r\nSingaporeans wish to be included in the conceptualisation  stage\r\n\r\nbefore  a  policy  is decided.  Too often, a policy  is  already\r\n\r\ndecided  and  feedback sessions are perceived  as  just  rubber-stamping sessions.  Consultation is thus often limited to  minor\r\n\r\ntinkering,  with no consideration for views which  may  be  more\r\n\r\nfundamentally different.  But I agree that I have seen  the  MPs\r\n\r\nhere  work very hard in their constituencies.  They gather  hard\r\n\r\nfacts  and manage grassroots inputs in a very pragmatic fashion.\r\n\r\nI  am  sure,  some  of them even meander policy constraints  and\r\n\r\nbureaucratic  politics and manage grassroots issues  in  a  very\r\n\r\neffective way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a joke that consensus is when you agree with me.\r\n\r\nIf  we are to achieve true consensus, we must recognise that  it\r\n\r\ntakes  a  lot of time as opposing positions have to be discussed\r\n\r\nand  re-discussed until all parties slowly grope  and  gravitate\r\n\r\ntowards a true consensus.  The process is as significant as  the\r\n\r\ngoals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the goals of consultation, consensus and\r\n\r\nconciliation  are based on values which are already  traditional\r\n\r\nto  our  societies.   Consensus can only be achieved  where  the\r\n\r\nframe  of  reference  is based on communitarian  needs  and  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of compromise.  This basically means that the individual\r\n\r\nis  important  as  part of a group or society  rather  than  the\r\n\r\nnotion  that  the individual is the centrepiece  of  all  social\r\n\r\nactions.   I believe that, in Singapore, these values have  been\r\n\r\nentrenched   and   therefore  we   do   have   the   fundamental\r\n\r\nprerequisites of a consensual society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would caution here though that we must not use consensual\r\n\r\npolitics  to discourage open debate and dissent.  The Government\r\n\r\nand  all  MPs  must constantly ask ourselves: are  our  dominant\r\n\r\nvalues  and  institutions truly representative of the  society's\r\n\r\nviews?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs are tasked to identify the issues of convergence and\r\n\r\nconflict of Singaporeans and to present their divergent views to\r\n\r\nthis House.  It is interesting to note that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister  earlier  on said that party politics  is  by  function\r\n\r\nnecessarily  adversarial.  But our MP, Dr Tan Cheng  Bock,  said\r\n\r\nMPs of this House are not.  The process of arriving at these two\r\n\r\ndifferent conclusions, I think, is worthy of reflection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that the attitude of agreeing to disagree without\r\n\r\nfear of being reprimanded or sanctioned has to be nurtured if we\r\n\r\nare  to  give  our  younger MPs the confidence  to  broaden  the\r\n\r\npolitical  agenda  and  the  boundaries  of  expressions,   thus\r\n\r\nenabling  them  to  safely  flex and test  their  own  political\r\n\r\nmuscles within Parliament and outside this House.  Singapore  in\r\n\r\nthe  next  century  needs PAP leaders who  are  good  listeners,\r\n\r\nnimble   thinkers,   persuasive  communicators   and   effective\r\n\r\ngrassroots networkers.  Such leadership is only honed  by  years\r\n\r\nof  internship in consultation and conciliation skills to  reach\r\n\r\nconsensus  among  contending stakeholders  in  and  outside  the\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the idea of increasing the role of Government\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Committees to reach out to  a  wider  network  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   and   truly  nurture  the  channels   of   policy\r\n\r\narticulation and feedback inputs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a less adversarial stance must begin, first, by Members in\r\n\r\nthis  House  adopting specific norms of collaboration.   In  the\r\n\r\nworkshop which I chaired on \"voluntarism and professionalism\" in\r\n\r\nIPS Civil Society seminar, we captured the norms of consultation\r\n\r\nin  an  acronym called IDEA.  That was in response to  BG  Yeo's\r\n\r\ncall  for  Singapore  idea.  The \"I\" stands for  Information  to\r\n\r\nactors  involved; \"D\" for Dialogue between state and  community;\r\n\r\n\"E\"  for  Enablement  characterised by a culture  of  initiative\r\n\r\nwhich the state must facilitate and nurture; and lastly, \"A\" for\r\n\r\nAccess to state agencies and resources.  These norms are for  me\r\n\r\nessential in our effort to harness State-society synergy in this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  outside of this Parliament to avoid  confrontational\r\n\r\npolitics  and  strengthen  civic  engagement  towards  goals  of\r\n\r\nconsultation, consensus and conciliation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is late\r\n\r\ninto the day, so let me make it short.\r\n\r\nFirst,  I  disagree with Mr Rai on the proposal to have  a  less\r\n\r\nadversarial parliamentary system because I believe it is in  the\r\n\r\nnature  of Parliament to be engaging, in fact, adversarial.   It\r\n\r\nis  through passionate debate, clashes of ideas, that out of  it\r\n\r\nmay merge a decision that I think is in the best interest of the\r\n\r\nmajority  of our population.  However, I support and agree  with\r\n\r\nMr  Rai  that the system of government and stance must  and  can\r\n\r\ncertainly  embody  the  values  of consultation,  consensus  and\r\n\r\nconciliation, and tolerance, as stated by Mdm Claire Chiang.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Shriniwas Rai for his references to\r\n\r\nencouragement  of  Roundtable which is  a  citizen  non-partisan\r\n\r\npolicy  discussion group.  On behalf of the Roundtable,  let  me\r\n\r\nsay  in  this  House  that we believe there exist  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nopportunities   where  ordinary  citizens  can  participate   in\r\n\r\ninfluencing and shaping national policies.  But this mission  to\r\n\r\nhave  unrestrained objective and impartial feedback is and  will\r\n\r\nalways  be a continuous journey.  It is in the nature of  debate\r\n\r\nand  discussion,  even amongst members of the  Roundtable,  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be disagreements and arguments, both  critical  and\r\n\r\npassionate.  Certainly, it takes bold initiative and courage  to\r\n\r\nexpress one's views in public because it is only natural that if\r\n\r\none's  views are made public, rebuttals, even robust  ones,  and\r\n\r\nserious engagements are to be expected.  It is a fact and  quite\r\n\r\nnatural  at  this stage that many Singaporeans have fears  about\r\n\r\nexpressing their views.  The situation must be improved.  But  I\r\n\r\nmust  say  that  the environment for expressing one's  views  is\r\n\r\nimproving.  It would take time, confidence and certainly a clear\r\n\r\nconscience,  both on the part of civil societies and Government,\r\n\r\nto  nurture  and  develop a friendly and cordial environment  to\r\n\r\nachieve  consensus, consultation and conciliation  in  decision-making.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\njust add to the discussion by saying that there is an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIslamic saying which says that differences of opinion can  be  a\r\n\r\nblessing,  but  not so much the type of differences  of  opinion\r\n\r\nthat  can tear the society apart.  In fact, what matters is  how\r\n\r\nwe manage those differences.  So in that context, Sir, I believe\r\n\r\nthat, yes, there can be more consultation, more conciliation and\r\n\r\neven  more  debate.   If adversarial means  that  we  have  less\r\n\r\ndeliberate  finding of fault or less putting up of motions  that\r\n\r\nwaste people's time, where hundreds of people have to listen  to\r\n\r\none  hour of old record being played and replayed, then  I  say,\r\n\r\n\"Let's  be  less  adversarial.\"  But if it means  a  contest  of\r\n\r\nideas, and if that is understood as being more adversarial, then\r\n\r\nI  say,  \"Let's be more adversarial\" in the sense that  we  have\r\n\r\nmore  contests of ideas, more exchanges of opinions and  let  us\r\n\r\ndecide  based on what is constructive and what is good  for  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that score, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that\r\n\r\nthis  motion,  of course, has different meanings  for  different\r\n\r\npeople,  just  as  the  Minister's  understanding  of  us  being\r\n\r\nnecessarily  adversarial as against Dr Tan Cheng Bock's  opinion\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  not  adversarial.  I think  the  answer  lies  in\r\n\r\nbetween.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  Sir,  Singapore is basically  a  multi-racial,\r\n\r\nmulti-cultural and multi-religious vulnerable small  nation.  In\r\n\r\nthe early days of our nation building, we went through a lot  of\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and  appeared to face a  very  bleak  prospect  of\r\n\r\nsurvival, because we were not adequately conditioned to stand on\r\n\r\nour  own  to  build up the nation.  In spite of that,  Singapore\r\n\r\nremains  undaunted  in the face of peril and has  overcome  many\r\n\r\ndifficulties during the past 33 years of nation building.   That\r\n\r\nwe  not  only survive, but also grow and prosper, is  definitely\r\n\r\nnot a mere \"economic miracle\" as described by the academics,  or\r\n\r\nto be taken for granted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of Singapore is basically due to the fact that\r\n\r\nwe  have shared and cherished a very fundamental but essentially\r\n\r\nimportant value in the process of nation building, that is,  the\r\n\r\nkey to survival is racial harmony and national unity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBecause  of  this common conviction, our people,  regardless  of\r\n\r\nrace, have been steadfast in giving the present government their\r\n\r\nstrong support through successive elections under the democratic\r\n\r\nparliamentary  electoral  system, notwithstanding  the  numerous\r\n\r\ndebates  and  trials and tribulations.  This  has  ensured  that\r\n\r\nthere is sustained political stability  to our country, and that\r\n\r\nGovernment policies and measures can be implemented smoothly  to\r\n\r\nachieve   the  desired  results.   This  kind  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy coupled with the shared value of our people  has  been\r\n\r\nconsistently upheld and realized to the benefit of  our  people,\r\n\r\nthereby  strengthening the confidence of  both  our  people  and\r\n\r\nforeign investors.  This is the key factor to our success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, racial harmony and national unity\r\n\r\ncan  only  be  maintained  through close  rapport  and  seamless\r\n\r\ncooperation  and  not  adversary or confrontation,  between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and  the  people.  The  relationship  between   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the people is like that of the lips  and  teeth.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a Chinese saying, \"When the lips are gone, the  teeth\r\n\r\nwill  be  in  trouble.\"   Through  the  democratic  process   of\r\n\r\nelection,  we  give the Government a mandate  and  therefore  we\r\n\r\nshould  have  full confidence in the Government.   At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  we  must try to understand the rationale of  the  various\r\n\r\nGovernment policies, and give the Government our support for the\r\n\r\nproper implementation of such policies.  On the other hand,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  acting  under the mandate of the  people,  has  the\r\n\r\nobligation to take the trouble to explain the various  important\r\n\r\npolicies  to  the  people  through Parliament  and  the  various\r\n\r\nadministrative   channels, with an enlightened and  consultative\r\n\r\nattitude.    At  the same time, they should listen open-mindedly\r\n\r\nto  the  views  of the people, and make the adjustments  to  the\r\n\r\npolicies  where necessary taking into consideration the feedback\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  In this way, the policies formulated will  not\r\n\r\nonly  serve  the  interests of the people but  also  have  their\r\n\r\ngreater  support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 33 years, the Government has accumulated a wealth\r\n\r\nof experience in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngoverning the country and, in terms of development strategy,  it\r\n\r\nhas  always adopted its own unique approach and is full of ideas\r\n\r\nin  tackling  major problems and it should value this  important\r\n\r\nasset.  Over the years, we can see that the Government is always\r\n\r\nfull  of confidence and has remained undaunted in the face of  a\r\n\r\ncrisis,   whenever  an  unpopular  but  necessary    policy   is\r\n\r\nimplemented  or  some measures have to be taken in  response  to\r\n\r\nchanges in current situation.  As a result, many people begin to\r\n\r\nadopt  the  attitude  of \"you do things,  I  am  rest  assured\",\r\n\r\nthereby leaving everything to the Government and refraining from\r\n\r\nactively  participating in discussions with  the  Government  on\r\n\r\nnational  policies.  To the democratic system  of  our  country,\r\n\r\nthis is not very encouraging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying: \"even the wise are not always free from\r\n\r\nerrors\".  If,  after winning the mandate from  the  people,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is to become arrogant and supercilious, refusing  to\r\n\r\nlisten to the views of the people and bent on having its own way\r\n\r\nin  the implementation of national policies, or  wilfully  takes\r\n\r\nsuppressive  action or rejects diverging views, then  this  will\r\n\r\nnot  only cause impediment to the implementation of the  policy,\r\n\r\nbut  also result in the loss of the people's confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In this way, our spirit of cooperation between  the\r\n\r\npolitical leaders and the people and our strength of unity  will\r\n\r\nbe  undermined, resulting in crisis and disaster to the country.\r\n\r\nI  believe that this is what the Government and the people would\r\n\r\nalways want to avoid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Shriniwas Rai has mentioned, we have inherited the\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy from the British.  We are also  building\r\n\r\nup  or  have  built up on this basis the necessary  changes  and\r\n\r\nadjustments  in  keeping with our prevailing  local  conditions,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  introduction  of  the  Elected  Presidency,  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  NCMP  and  NMP.   Outside  Parliament,  under  the\r\n\r\nleadership  of  our  Prime Minister, the Government  has,  among\r\n\r\nothers, set up the Feedback Unit and strengthened the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommunication channels with the grassroots organisations and the\r\n\r\nCDCs to enhance the cooperative relationships between the people\r\n\r\nand  the  Government.  The Government has also  opened  up  more\r\n\r\ncommunication  channels and conducted several dialogue  sessions\r\n\r\nto  gather  feedback from the people on our major  policies  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment strategies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we have already developed this healthy and sound\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy system and the communication channels to\r\n\r\nstrengthen   rapport   and  cooperation  better    between   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the people, why should we discuss this motion  at\r\n\r\nall  in  this Parliament?  Are we \"moaning and groaning  without\r\n\r\nbeing   ill\"  or  entertaining  imaginary  or  groundless  fears\r\n\r\nunnecessarily?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Shriniwas Rai moves this motion at a\r\n\r\ntime when we are being affected by the current financial crisis.\r\n\r\nI   think   it   is  well  intentioned.   It  has   far-reaching\r\n\r\nsignificance.   Whether a system is good or bad  may  depend  on\r\n\r\ncertain objective circumstances.  A good system cannot be  taken\r\n\r\nfor granted or treated as eternally reliable.  In this turbulent\r\n\r\nand  competitive age, the results we have achieved  through  our\r\n\r\npast  efforts  can  easily  be wiped out  overnight  because  of\r\n\r\nchanges  in  circumstances and the prevailing  factors.   If  we\r\n\r\nadopt  an  indifferent attitude, we may unwittingly  drift  into\r\n\r\neither  of  two extremes:  one where the people are  indifferent\r\n\r\nand  apathetic  to Government policies,  leaving everything   to\r\n\r\nthe   Government,  and  completely  oblivious  of  whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is bent on doing things its own way when formulating\r\n\r\nand  implementing new policies; or the other, where  the  people\r\n\r\nare   consistently  confrontational  against   the   Government.\r\n\r\nWhatever  policy  the Government formulates or implements,  they\r\n\r\nwill  query and use every possible means to find fault with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and attack it in order to embarrass  and  tear  the\r\n\r\nGovernment apart. If we allow this trend to set in and to  grow,\r\n\r\nit  will become a very corruptive social influence and may  mark\r\n\r\nthe beginning of our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndecline.  Therefore, we must remain very alert.  In a moment  of\r\n\r\ncrisis,    we   must  treasure  and  protect  our  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to prevent our people, particularly the\r\n\r\nyounger  generation, from moving into either one  of  these  two\r\n\r\nextremes,  we should start from Parliament itself to openly  and\r\n\r\nfrankly  discuss national issues constructively and  extensively\r\n\r\nwithout  being personal and without discrimination.  It is  only\r\n\r\nin  this  way  that  we will be able to give full  play  to  the\r\n\r\nfunction of Parliament.  I hope that my parliamentary colleagues\r\n\r\nwill  do  their homework to reflect the views of the people  and\r\n\r\ngive   their  constructive  criticisms  so  as  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nGovernment policies can be better formulated and implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I also hope that the Ministers themselves\r\n\r\nwill  have more patience in listening to the views of MPs.  When\r\n\r\nanswering questions, although  the Ministers cannot be  expected\r\n\r\nto  concede  to  all  our requests, they  should  at  least   be\r\n\r\nreceptive   and   tolerant  to  the  more  critical   views   or\r\n\r\nconstructive  suggestions which they might find it difficult  to\r\n\r\naccept  at  the outset.  I hope the Ministers can   become  more\r\n\r\nmagnanimous  and give due consideration to such suggestions  put\r\n\r\nforward  by  the  MPs or ask the officials in  their  ministries\r\n\r\nconcerned to look into the suggestions and adopt those which are\r\n\r\nlater  considered necessary and appropriate.  There is a  saying\r\n\r\nthat  good  advice  is jarring  the ears.   The  Ministers  must\r\n\r\nalways  bear this in mind in listening to the people  for  their\r\n\r\nviews and adopting their suggestions, when appropriate, so as to\r\n\r\nensure smooth implementation of Government policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside Parliament, the Government has spared no effort in\r\n\r\npromoting  its  rapport  and  cooperation  with  the  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations.   As  regards other  civic  bodies  such  as  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  and  commercial  organisations,  I  hope  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should also treat them with equal  importance.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment should try to open up more communication channels  to\r\n\r\nprovide more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  greater interaction and cooperation  between\r\n\r\nthe Government and the business community.  In terms of economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  I  would  appeal to the  Government  to  give  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community more substantive participatory opportunities\r\n\r\nso  as  to adopt a more united and cooperative approach  to  the\r\n\r\nissues  at hand.  This will encourage the business community  to\r\n\r\nmake  greater  contributions to our economic development.   With\r\n\r\nthis  in  mind, it will be a positive step on the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to hold dialogue sessions with the business community\r\n\r\nbefore  the Budget is formulated every year, to listen to  their\r\n\r\nproblems and views to ensure that when the Budget is formulated,\r\n\r\nit  will  take  into consideration the inputs  of  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity, thereby earning their unreserved support.  I hope the\r\n\r\nGovernment can seriously consider this suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion in principle.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I assure you that I\r\n\r\nwill be very brief.  I know that it is past dinner time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am grateful to Members who have spoken. Whether\r\n\r\nthey  agree  or disagree, it is another matter.  The  fact  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  expressed  their opinions,  I  think,  is  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant issue.  In keeping with the tradition of the  contents\r\n\r\nof  the  motion,  I have decided, in consultation with my  other\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  to amend the motion.  I would like  to  delete  the\r\n\r\nwords, \"less adversarial\".  Sir, the motion would now read:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House recognises the need to evolve a\r\n\r\nparliamentary system which will further strengthen  the  process\r\n\r\nof consultation, consensus and conciliation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Rai, could you please put it down on\r\n\r\npaper?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I have written it down, Sir.

Mr Wong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, in the spirit of consensus seeking,\r\n\r\nMr Rai has shown me a note of his intention to amend his motion.\r\n\r\nAgain, do not consider me as an adversary if I disagree with him\r\n\r\nthis  time  round.  Because his motion reads, \"That  this  House\r\n\r\nrecognises  the  need  to  evolve a parliamentary  system  [even\r\n\r\nwithout  those  words  that he wanted to take  out]  which  will\r\n\r\nfurther  strengthen the process of consultation,  consensus  and\r\n\r\nconciliation.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I do not see Parliament having a need to evolve\r\n\r\nsuch a system.  As I have explained, this Parliament is for  the\r\n\r\nOpposition   and  the  ruling  party  to  debate  policies   and\r\n\r\nprogrammes  openly  so that each side can present  their  ideas,\r\n\r\nprogrammes and policies so that they can win the next  election.\r\n\r\nThe  contention between political parties is unavoidable.   That\r\n\r\nis  why  Parliament  is  adversarial.  There  may  be  different\r\n\r\ndegrees  of  being adversaries.  Whether Dr Tan  Cheng  Bock  is\r\n\r\nright or I am right, it does not really matter.  What matters is\r\n\r\nthat  in this system that we have, it is necessarily adversarial\r\n\r\nbecause different political parties will have different policies\r\n\r\nand  we must disagree.  Even if we agree to disagree, we can  do\r\n\r\nit civilly no doubt.  But since\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolitical  parties are there to win elections and  to  form  the\r\n\r\ngovernment, they would take their respective position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as other views are concerned, the way we should\r\n\r\nconduct our business, I agree, yes, we can be civil, we  can  be\r\n\r\nconsultative, we can be consensus seeking and indeed, as I  have\r\n\r\nnoticed  that  many of the MPs who spoke up were actually  NMPs.\r\n\r\nAnd the Opposition is conspicuously absent.  Not a single one is\r\n\r\nhere!   I  do  not know whether it indicates that  they  do  not\r\n\r\nsupport Mr Rai's motion or they simply voted with their feet.  I\r\n\r\nwill leave it to you to draw the conclusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whatever it is, whatever amendment that Mr Rai would like to\r\n\r\nmake,  particularly the one that he talked about, and his  whole\r\n\r\nmotion  starts  off  with  recognising  the  need  to  be   less\r\n\r\nadversarial, that I cannot support.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Rai, you have the floor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I think I have achieved my objective.

Jayakumar (for the Prime Minister):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The situation in Indonesia is calmer after two weeks of\r\n\r\nunrest.  President Soeharto resigned on the morning of  Thursday\r\n\r\n21st  May 1998. This statesmanlike step was the final act of  32\r\n\r\nyears   of   service  to  his  country.   President   Soeharto's\r\n\r\nachievements,  both in Indonesia and the region, were  many  and\r\n\r\ndistinguished.  They will not be forgotten.  In accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian  Constitution, Vice President  Dr  B  J  Habibie\r\n\r\nsucceeded President Soeharto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of office in Indonesia was accomplished peaceably\r\n\r\nand  constitutionally.  President Habibie has said that he would\r\n\r\nimplement political and economic reforms.  The Indonesian people\r\n\r\nwill decide on the nature, pace and direction of their political\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 22nd May 1998, President Habibie announced his new Reform\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Cabinet.   He  has  retained  respected   economic\r\n\r\nministers, led by Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and\r\n\r\nIndustry  Dr  Ginandjar  Kartasasmita.  President  Habibie  also\r\n\r\ndeclared his commitment to the programme of reforms agreed  with\r\n\r\nthe  IMF.  The World Bank and the IMF have responded positively.\r\n\r\nWe  hope  that this will encourage an early return of confidence\r\n\r\nin the Indonesian economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia's Government faces many challenges. Expectations of\r\n\r\npolitical  and  economic  reforms are  high.   The  new  Cabinet\r\n\r\nrecognises  that  its  immediate goal is  social  and  political\r\n\r\nstability  to  achieve economic recovery.  The  country's  large\r\n\r\nprivate debt is now estimated at about US$80 billion.   Problems\r\n\r\nof  inflation,  unemployment, the difficulty of  trade  and  the\r\n\r\nreconstruction  of the banking system must also be  dealt  with.\r\n\r\nIndonesia must also repair supply and distribution networks that\r\n\r\nwere  disrupted in the recent unrest, so as to ensure  a  steady\r\n\r\nsupply  of essential goods.  The new Government will come  under\r\n\r\nintense pressure to resolve the economic problems quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish President Habibie and his new Government success in\r\n\r\ndealing  with the tough challenges facing Indonesia  today.   We\r\n\r\nhope  that he will succeed in restoring political certainty  and\r\n\r\nconfidence, the pre-requisites of economic recovery.   A  stable\r\n\r\nand  prosperous  Indonesia  will  contribute  significantly   to\r\n\r\nregional  stability. Indonesia has been a key  player  in  ASEAN\r\n\r\nsince  its inception.

Secondly, it could encourage some employers\r\n\r\nto  shed  their  responsibility of having to pay a  retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefit  to  the affected workers.  Thirdly, paying retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits on behalf of employers would lead us closer to a system\r\n\r\nof unemployment benefits with all its undesirable side-effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience of countries with welfare system including\r\n\r\nunemployment   benefits  has  shown  that  there   are   serious\r\n\r\ndisadvantages when the state assumes such responsibility.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  imposing  a  heavy financial burden on the  taxpayers,  it\r\n\r\nprovides  workers  with  a false sense of  security,  encourages\r\n\r\nprolonged  periods  of  unemployment and reduces  the  sense  of\r\n\r\nurgency  in  skill  upgrading. Over time,  it  could  erode  the\r\n\r\npositive  work  attitudes  which  are  crucial  for  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontinued success in economic competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are not leaving retrenched workers including those\r\n\r\nwho   failed  to  secure  retrenchment  payments  to  fend   for\r\n\r\nthemselves.   Government has committed $50 million with  another\r\n\r\n$50 million from the Skills Development Fund to extend the reach\r\n\r\nof   the  Skill  Redevelopment  Programme.   This  programme  is\r\n\r\nspecifically  targetted at older workers, who  would  face  more\r\n\r\ndifficulty  getting alternative jobs, to be  retrained  for  new\r\n\r\njobs.   Apart  from paying for the training cost, the  Programme\r\n\r\nalso  bears  part  of the wage cost of the  worker  when  he  is\r\n\r\nundergoing  training.   This will make it  more  attractive  for\r\n\r\nother employers to take in these workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore of the view that it will not be in the interest\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  to  set  up a retrenchment fund  to  help  ailing\r\n\r\ncompanies pay retrenchment benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BROADENING EDUCATION OF STUDENTS IN JUNIOR COLLEGES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31.

Through this scheme, the\r\n\r\nmarried child can exchange his existing flat with another lessee\r\n\r\nwhose  flat is close to that belonging to the former's  parents,\r\n\r\nso that the married child could live close to his parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Studio Apartments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1998, the first batch of Studio Apartments for elderly\r\n\r\nwas  launched  in  the older estates as an alternative  form  of\r\n\r\nhousing for senior citizens.  HDB is mindful of maintaining  the\r\n\r\nfamily  ties between the elderly lessees who wish to live  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  their  children  but yet be near to them.  Thus,  priority\r\n\r\nallocation  of  Studio Apartments is given  to  elderly  lessees\r\n\r\nwhose  children  are taking over the elderly  lessee's  existing\r\n\r\nflats  that  are located in the same electoral division  as  the\r\n\r\nStudio  Apartments. With this, the elderly lessees are  able  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  living  in  the same housing  estate  which  they  are\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with, and at the same time be in close proximity  with\r\n\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will keep an open mind to new proposals that aim to encour\r\n\r\nage  young  couples  to buy a flat to stay with  or  near  their\r\n\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LONGER PERIOD TO COMPLETE SALE OF HDB FLATS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  whether  he  will  consider  allowing  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board upgraders to have longer than the  current  6-month period to complete the sale of their old flats in view  of\r\n\r\nthe weak sentiments in the property market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lessee who has collected the keys to his new HDB flat is given\r\n\r\n6  months  to  sell  his existing HDB flat in the  open  market.\r\n\r\nGenerally,  this is a sufficient period for the lessee  to  sell\r\n\r\nhis existing flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the lessee is unable to sell his existing flat\r\n\r\nwithin  the  6  months  due  to justifiable  reasons,  HDB  will\r\n\r\nconsider extending the six-month period on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PLAN TO FOSTER STRONG CHINESE CULTURAL ELITE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Information\r\n\r\nand  the  Arts (a) whether the Government has set up any  target\r\n\r\nand  concrete plan of action to foster a strong Chinese cultural\r\n\r\nelite; and (b) in what way can the Government encourage and work\r\n\r\nwith  the ethnic Chinese community to achieve the target without\r\n\r\ncausing  any  undesirable ethnic sensitivity in our multi-racial\r\n\r\nand multi-cultural society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's plan to encourage the use of Chinese and help\r\n\r\nfoster  a Chinese cultural elite was outlined by PM in his  1997\r\n\r\nNational  Day  Rally speech and DPM Lee in his  speech  at  last\r\n\r\nyear's  launch of the Speak Mandarin Campaign.

MITA and its statutory boards work closely  with\r\n\r\nChinese civic organisations in many activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speak Mandarin Campaign is now in its 20th year and has\r\n\r\nachieved  some  success.   The National Arts  Council  regularly\r\n\r\nsupports  Chinese  performing and literary  arts.  The  National\r\n\r\nHeritage   Board's  Asian  Civilisations  Museum  explores   and\r\n\r\npresents  the heritage of Singaporeans in the context  of  their\r\n\r\nancestral  cultures. The National Library Board has  signed  co-operation agreements with the National Library of China and  the\r\n\r\nShanghai  Library, which will allow Singaporeans to  access  the\r\n\r\ncatalogues  of  these two libraries. The NLB has  also  embarked\r\n\r\nupon  an  expansion programme to expand and improve its  Chinese\r\n\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts help to ensure that we have a sizeable group of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans with a good command of Chinese and a deep knowledge\r\n\r\nof Chinese culture.

At the close of tender on 31st December\r\n\r\n1997,  2  consortia submitted bids - the StarHub consortium  and\r\n\r\nP2P  consortium. The Tender Evaluation Committee evaluated  both\r\n\r\nbids  and recommended that both consortia be awarded the  mobile\r\n\r\nphone licences. Tender results were announced on 23rd April. The\r\n\r\nnext  day, 24th April, GTE, one of the consortium members  named\r\n\r\nin  the P2P tender document,  issued a statement that it was not\r\n\r\na  member of the P2P consortium and had no equity stake  in  the\r\n\r\nventure.  This  was contrary to what was claimed in  the  tender\r\n\r\ndocument.    The   incident   has   created   much   unnecessary\r\n\r\ninconvenience to TAS and the other parties involved. TAS is  now\r\n\r\ninvestigating whether there was any misrepresentation  in  P2P's\r\n\r\ntender submission. I expect the investigation to be completed in\r\n\r\nthe   next   few  weeks.  Depending  on  the  outcome   of   the\r\n\r\ninvestigation,  appropriate action will  be  taken  against  the\r\n\r\nparties concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two parts to the tender. One is the tender submission\r\n\r\nprocess.  Like  other  government tenders, TAS'  current  tender\r\n\r\nsubmission  process does not categorically stipulate  that  each\r\n\r\nand every partner in a consortium must sign the tender document.\r\n\r\nThis  has not given rise to any problem with TAS' other  tenders\r\n\r\nuntil now. However in view of this incident, I have asked TAS to\r\n\r\nreview  the  tender  submission  requirements  to  see  if   any\r\n\r\nimprovements  can be made to ensure that such incidents  do  not\r\n\r\nhappen again in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part of the tender process is the tender evaluation.\r\n\r\nTo  make the process as transparent as possible,TAS made  public\r\n\r\nthe  key  evaluation criteria of the tender  as  well  as  their\r\n\r\nweightages. The tender proposals were evaluated based  on  these\r\n\r\ncriteria by a Tender Evaluation Committee which included members\r\n\r\nfrom the public and the private sectors. I am satisfied that all\r\n\r\nnecessary measures were taken to preserve the integrity  of  the\r\n\r\ntender evaluation process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of re-tender, TAS will not be calling another\r\n\r\ntender  soon. However, depending on how the market develops  and\r\n\r\nif  there is a need, it is possible that future tenders could be\r\n\r\ncalled  before the year 2000. Nevertheless, I should  point  out\r\n\r\nthat  with one more mobile licence awarded this time, there will\r\n\r\nbe three competing operators come year 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PSA CORPORATION LTD</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications, in respect of PSA Corporation Ltd, (a) what  are\r\n\r\nits return on assets, return on equity and net profit margin for\r\n\r\n1997  given its pre-tax profit of $1,124 million and  how  these\r\n\r\nfigures compare with the targets set for its flotation; (b)  how\r\n\r\nit  prices  its services; (c) how the drive to list  it  on  the\r\n\r\nStock Exchange of Singapore impacts on its service pricing;  and\r\n\r\n(d)  whether the Corporation will consider passing on  the  huge\r\n\r\npre-tax  profit to the industry by lowering various port tariffs\r\n\r\nand charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The financial figures requested are as follows:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n          Return on Total Asset    :    11.8%\r\n\r\n          Return on Equity         :    14.6%\r\n\r\n          Return on Sales          :    39.0%\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return on Sales figure excludes non-operating income accumulated\r\n\r\nwhen PSA was a statutory board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures are for PSA, the statutory board, from January to\r\n\r\nSeptember 1997 and PSA Corporation, the company, from October to\r\n\r\nDecember 1997.   If we applied the corporate tax of 26% for  the\r\n\r\nfirst 9 months when PSA was a statutory board, the figures would\r\n\r\nbe  lower at 11.1%, 13.8% and 37%, respectively.  These  figures\r\n\r\nwould be lower for PSA Corporation in future years because  upon\r\n\r\ncorporatisation on 1st October 1997, PSA's assets were  revalued\r\n\r\nto  market  prices,  and as a company, PSA Corporation  will  be\r\n\r\nsubjected to a higher corporate tax regime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA was corporatised less than 1 year ago - in October 1997.\r\n\r\nThe date for PSA's privatisation has not been fixed.  Similarly,\r\n\r\ndetails  such as financial targets or extent of share  placement\r\n\r\nhave not been decided yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b and c) The bulk of PSA's container business is in\r\n\r\ntranshipment  cargo.  In this area of business, PSA  faces  keen\r\n\r\ncompetition  from  other  ports in the region.   Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment does not regulate the charges for transhipment cargo.\r\n\r\nPSA as a corporatised entity is fully aware that its prices must\r\n\r\nbe competitive and relevant to the needs and requirements of its\r\n\r\ncustomers, otherwise they will have no hesitation to  use  other\r\n\r\nregional ports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for local cargo, the Government does regulate the\r\n\r\ntariffs  through the Maritime and Port Authority.   This  is  to\r\n\r\nensure  they  remain competitive and safeguard the  interest  of\r\n\r\nlocal exporters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA's pricing strategy is not influenced by plans for its\r\n\r\nlisting on the Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The port industry is a highly competitive international\r\n\r\nbusiness.   It  is  also  very capital intensive.  For  example,\r\n\r\nPhases  I  and  II of the new Pasir Panjang Terminal  will  cost\r\n\r\nabout  $7000 million.  Setting the correct level of  tariffs  is\r\n\r\ncritical to its viability. It must provide customers with value-for-money. It must also allow PSA to make a reasonable return on\r\n\r\nits investment so that it can reward its shareholders, its staff\r\n\r\nand re-invest in the business. Therefore, PSA has always set the\r\n\r\nprices for its services very competitively.  Over the years, PSA\r\n\r\nhas  focused on reducing cost and improving the productivity  of\r\n\r\nits  operations.   The productivity gains are  shared  with  its\r\n\r\ncustomers  in  the form of discounts, rebates and  lower  tariff\r\n\r\nrates.   PSA  will continue to look into ways to  further  lower\r\n\r\ncosts  or increase cost effectiveness of its services, and  pass\r\n\r\non these savings to its customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NATIONAL OUTREACH PROGRAMME IN MARINE PARADE AND TANJONG PAGAR</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CDCs</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunity   Development  if  he  will  provide  the  preliminary\r\n\r\nfindings  on  the  needs of 15,000 low-income  homes  in  Marine\r\n\r\nParade  and  Tanjong Pagar CDCs which 170 volunteers visited  as\r\n\r\npart of a national outreach programme started in December 1997.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Nominated Member of Parliament for her interest in\r\n\r\nthe  outreach  programme.

Income tax is calculated based on the income  earned  in\r\n\r\nthe  preceding year while property tax is based on the  rentable\r\n\r\nvalue of the property for the same year.  Payment of income  tax\r\n\r\nis  due  one  month after the issue of the notice of  assessment\r\n\r\nwhile property tax is payable in advance in January and July  of\r\n\r\neach year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help taxpayers, the Government has administratively allowed\r\n\r\nproperty  tax and income tax to be paid in instalments over  the\r\n\r\ntax  year  instead  of  the due dates.   Basically,  any  person\r\n\r\nwilling to commence instalment payment from the beginning  of  a\r\n\r\ntax  year  is allowed to pay the year's tax in equal instalments\r\n\r\nover  the whole year.  By allowing instalment payments over  the\r\n\r\nyear  for  which  the tax is payable and not  beyond,  it  helps\r\n\r\ntaxpayers to plan their finances and prevents them from  getting\r\n\r\ninto  huge  tax arrears.  Taxpayers who have temporary  cashflow\r\n\r\nproblems can, nevertheless, apply to IRAS for payment of the tax\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  12-months instalment period, with appropriate  late\r\n\r\npayment penalty for the extended period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the experience of IRAS, there is as yet no serious problem\r\n\r\nof  taxpayers being unable to meet tax payments which  fall  due\r\n\r\nwith the current instalment facilities.  IRAS is monitoring  the\r\n\r\nsituation  and  Government  will introduce  relief  measures  if\r\n\r\nnecessary.
