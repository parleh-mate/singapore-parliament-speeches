These expressways are also our economic arteries. They are designed to move people and goods quickly and efficiently, and save them time and money. The recent modification of RPS on CTE has achieved this objective. Average speed on the CTE has improved from 25 kph to above 60 kph. Volume of traffic using the CTE during peak hours has dropped by 20%. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes have resulted in some traffic moving to alternative routes around the CTE. Traffic surveys show that traffic volume on these roads has increased by about 3% during the RPS operation hours. While there are localised congestion at some stretches, the average speed of vehicles on these roads is about 20 kph. This is comparable to travel speeds prior to the amendment of RPS on CTE on 1st July. LTA expects traffic conditions along these routes to stabilise in due course as motorists adjust their travel patterns. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorists who do not wish to pay for a licence to use the CTE and who do not wish to add to the congestion along the alternative routes should seriously consider several other options. They can adjust their travel pattern by staggering their travel times, or they can shift to public transport or they can car-pool with a friend. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Ministry consider taking certain measures to alleviate the jams along the alternative routes? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, where possible, LTA will adjust traffic lights and carry out localised road improvements along the affected roads to remove any bottlenecks and facilitate smoother traffic flows. However, motorists must realise that the objective of the RPS is to ease the congestion along our expressways and to provide them with a choice of fast transit. So motorists must also consider these other options that I have mentioned, such as taking public transport, park-and-ride, car pooling or changing their time of travel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform Members that the public response to the four new express bus services introduced in conjunction with the extended RPS scheme since 5th May 1997 has been encouraging. Due to commuters' requests, I am informed that SBS would be revising the schedules of its express buses to improve their frequency and capacity provision. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Would the bus companies be encouraged to provide more such express services? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, currently, there are four express bus services - one from the North, two from the North-east, and one from the East - and these are designed to address the congestion problem that the Member has mentioned. SBS will review from time to time not just its frequency and capacity but also other bus service possibilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, could the Minister of State consider taking away one gantry point near Toa Payoh at the Central Expressway (CTE) so as not to make things difficult for residents who want to use the PIE to go to Changi Airport in the morning? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the two gantry points are complementary. In our analysis, we discovered that there are motorists who make use of that stretch of the expressway between the two gantry points to go to the PIE. But that contributed to congestion and caused kickbacks as far back as the first gantry point and further up north. On the whole, we prefer to have the two gantry points so as to provide an effective solution. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman:</b> Sir, could the Minister of State then consider allowing traffic that goes towards Changi Airport in the morning to use the CTE and PIE without payment because it does not cause congestion in the morning? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as I explained, they use that stretch of the expressway and therefore they are contributing congestion. The only way to reduce congestion is to ensure that those who use that stretch of the expressway also have to pay. If they value faster transit they should use the CTE. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>APPLICATION SYSTEM FOR HAWKER STALLS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Harun bin A.

Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, could the Minister reconsider his decision so that the lower income or hardship cases have a chance to tender for a hawker stall? Otherwise, they would not have a chance to obtain a hawker stall because the present tender prices are very high. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the tender process is open to everybody. There are two sectors of stalls available - one is the market produce stalls and the other is the cooked food stalls. We have about 70 market produce stalls and 25 cooked food stalls being tendered out every two months. So far, for the market produce stalls, the take-up rate has been about 70%. I would suggest that the hardship cases, if they are really interested in having a stall, should try to participate in the tender programme for the market produce stalls where the likelihood of their being successful would be pretty good. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>STAGED ACCIDENTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Complaints)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Police Force has received complaints of \"staged accidents\". \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Police takes a serious view of staged accidents. It is monitoring the situation very closely. These accidents are related to the problem of workshop crew touting for business. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Police's assessment is that instances of staged accidents are relatively few. From time to time, Police receives reports from motorists claiming that the circumstances under which accidents they were involved in were suspicious. Police investigations into these reports have not disclosed any evidence of staging, although in some of them, there was sufficient evidence to proceed on careless driving. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three cases of suspected staging were cited by the Straits Times on 7th July 1997. Traffic Police has carefully investigated them. There is insufficient evidence to prove that any of the accidents was staged. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police will continue to investigate cases where staging of accidents is suspected or where workshop crew persistently annoy, harass, or intimidate motorists in an effort to offer their services. Since 1995, there have been three reported cases of touting. The culprits in two of the cases have been convicted whilst the third case is still under investigation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time that the issue of staged traffic accidents and touting has surfaced. In 1991, Police received numerous complaints of highway touts pestering accident victims for repair services. The touts had arrived almost immediately after an accident occurred on the road. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police then conducted an operation against highway touts and arrested 13 persons. Police also seized two transceivers which were used to listen to emergency service frequencies. As a result, the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (TAS) Act was amended in 1993 to deter such unauthorised access. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These activities abated considerably. But in 1994 reports of such practices resurfaced. Police responded with strict enforcement against touts and towing crew plying the thoroughfares. Police also collated information on suspected workshops involved in hiring accident stagers and monitored them closely. Further, Police secured its radio transmission network by encrypting its channels to prevent eavesdropping by touts. The enforcement action successfully cleared up touting activities until the recent cases were reported in the press. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police recognises that enforcement action alone cannot be the solution. Other than difficulty in securing evidence, sporadic reports of possible occurrences require intensive manpower resources to investigate effectively. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police has met with Mr Tan Kin Lian, CEO of NTUC INCOME to discuss the problem. His assessment is that staging of accidents is one facet of a wider set of problems which include touting and fraudulent insurance claims. The problem has to be addressed at source with the motor insurance industry taking the initiative. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motor insurance industry can do this by looking into the existing practice of assessment and claims which may be circumvented by workshops involved with touts and accident stagers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motoring public can also play their part by being vigilant when driving. They should keep a safe distance from the vehicles in front, even when vehicles try to cut into their paths. Also, they should not be pressurised into accepting the services of towing crews at the scene of accident and should report any touting activities to the Police. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the problem of staged accidents is not widespread, the public can be assured that Police will take strict enforcement action and adopt a serious view of all such reports. All allegations of staged accidents will be investigated thoroughly. Whenever there is sufficient evidence, offenders will be prosecuted in court where deterrent sentences will be pressed against them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, I think Members of this House have from time to time also received similar complaints from residents as well and we can all agree to take a serious view of this matter as it endangers lives on the roads. My question to the Minister of State is whether the current legislation is sufficient to tackle this problem and whether the penalties are sufficient deterrents. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, if a person is caught for touting, as had happened, he is punished under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act for which a person, if liable and convicted, can be fined not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> months or to both. If it is a second or subsequent conviction, he may be liable to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both. Of course, if a person is convicted of staging an accident, then it depends on what consequences have arisen. If, as a result of the accident, people are hurt, then a range of penalties is open under which he may be liable, including for serious cases, even under section 304 of the Penal Code (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) or voluntarily causing grievous hurt or hurt or mischief. It depends on what arises from the accident. I think the penalties are in place. The question, of course, is how to ensure that there is sufficient evidence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I would like to assure Mr Chng and the House that we would take a comprehensive approach. Police is at the end, ie, when a report comes in, we investigate. But I have asked Traffic Police to work with the motor insurance industry - I think that is the nub of the problem and the way to a solution - so that they can come together and agree on a practice, for example, of authorised workshops. To do this, I think, the industry must come together, because if some break ranks, then it does not work. So we will see what arises from these discussions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, saying that touting and staging of accidents are part and parcel of the same problem, will the Minister of State agree that $1,000 fine seems rather low under today's conditions and, at the same time, in view of the fact that we have so far failed to bring many of these people to book? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> As I say, these possible offences are linked - touting, submitting of fraudulent claims and, possibly, staging of accidents. But, of course, touting encompasses a host of activities, not just touting on the roads. Touting can also take place in a retail setting. But I think Mr Chng's point is that if a person is caught for touting with regard to possible staged accidents, then higher penalties should be imposed. I can ask Police to consider this point. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PASIR RIS MRT STATION</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Construction of covered linkways)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Mr Charles Chong</b> asked the Minister for Communications whether covered walkways from the Pasir Ris MRT Station to nearby bus stops and a vehicle drop-off and pick-up point will be constructed and, if so, when construction is expected to commence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (for the Minister for Communications):</b> I am pleased to inform the Member that the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will construct covered linkways from the Pasir Ris MRT station to nearby bus stops along Pasir Ris Drive 1.

So these are the programmes that the LTA has taken the initiative to launch. But as for other requests, as I mentioned, pick-up points and drop-off points, I do not think they will be applicable in every case. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, besides IUP and MUP, there are other commuter needs.

For the remaining food court unit, HDB has completed many rounds of tender exercises but has found very few demand for the unit. No tenant has been found so far. This shows that the eight other eating establishments currently operating in Serangoon Town Centre and the private sector eating outlets in Serangoon are sufficient to meet the needs of the residents. The latest tender exercise for this unit is currently in progress and will close at the end of the month. If this latest tender exercise is unsuccessful, the HDB will let out the unit for other uses. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Does the Minister agree that this space was not able to be tendered out because the minimum reserve price is too high? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as is the present practice, all tenders put out have a minimum reserve price. For the six tender exercises which were completed, there were either no tender bids at all or one or two tender bids which came below HDB's reserve tender price. For example, the latest tender, the sixth tender, managed to attract only one bid. This is obviously not a competitive tender and therefore it was not awarded. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether HDB should consider lowering the reserve tender price in order to have a successful tender, rather than leave the space there vacant for so long? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I replied earlier, the space will not be left vacant.

So the Government agency evaluating the tender and the person making the evaluation are two separate bodies. In a Government tender, whoever is the agency, HDB or URA, will close the tender on a particular date and time. At that date and time, the Chief Valuer participates in the tender just like any other private sector agency. The Chief Valuer will put in a tender bid stating what he determines to be the reserve price, evaluating the market evidence. Similarly for HDB tenders, the same practice is done. The Commercial Property Section runs the tender, but the Valuation Officer in HDB is a separate agency that will put in a reserve bid. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask whether only market forces are taken into consideration or whether the needs of the community around there are considered? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As the evidence shows, there are enough eating outlets in the Serangoon Road area.

It has also come at a time when the US economy is surging ahead very strongly with low inflation, with the Dow Jones hitting a record 8000 recently while the regional economies here seem to be taking a beating with the Thai baht and the Philippine peso having depreciated significantly against the US dollar. The ringgit has also come under pressure lately. Even the Singapore dollar has weakened somewhat against the US dollar. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is general consensus that we are facing an economic slowdown today. The good news so far is that it does not seem to be as bad as the one we experienced back in 1985-87, many of whom have already forgotten as it was so brief. In fact, this slowdown is useful as it serves to remind all of us that prices do not just go up one way. They can also come down and stay down, just like the share prices have done since January 1994. On the other hand, the bad news is that our costs of doing business have been creeping up, eroding our competitiveness. And unless some concerted action led by the Government is taken, the slowdown may become much more severe. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this economic backdrop, it is not surprising that the business community expects the budget to address the issue of competitiveness and to offer some relief to the high costs of doing business in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Parliamentary Committee for Finance, Trade and Industry met up for informal dialogue sessions with three trade associations, just before the Budget Statement was announced, namely, the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce, the Singapore Confederation of Industries and the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry. They had wishlists which were largely not met by the budget. I will dwell upon them later. Our GPC also met up with our resource \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> panel members comprising many prominent business people and professionals from a wide spectrum of the finance and business community. And this we did after the Budget Statement was announced. Their reaction generally was that the budget benefitted only the larger financial institutions and a small select group of business people involved in logistics. The local business community was generally disappointed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share some of the sentiments of the local business community. However, if we regard this more like an interim budget and also remember that the Committee set up to look into the long term competitiveness of Singapore is still hard at work, we put these into perspective, we will feel less disappointed. I think we should also be grateful that there were no new tax increases, not even the perennial ones on cigarettes and liquor. We should also not forget the number of positive tax reliefs on the personal side. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, this year's budget is moderately positive, although skewed too much towards the foreign financial community. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget does not address the main concern of business people, and that is, reducing the cost of doing business in Singapore so that our enterprises can become more competitive vis-a-vis our neighbours. I believe some time before the Budget Statement, the JTC did announce the freezing of rentals for industrial properties at current prices. There were also some adjustments made to the foreign workers' levy for certain sectors. Off budget action taken to control costs, however, gives the impression that such action appears ad hoc and uncoordinated. There is a perception that nobody seems to be monitoring and coordinating measures to contain, if not to reduce the cost of doing business here. Otherwise, a package to this effect would have been announced at this Budget Statement. Perhaps, the Government is waiting for the Committee on the Long Term Competitiveness of Singapore to come up with its findings first before taking action. Whatever the real reason may be, the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> message I would like to put across today is that our business community is extremely anxious about the current state of affairs and would like to see an integrated Government approach in dealing with the issue of cost. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should also not hesitate to revisit fundamental assumptions, or \"sacred cows\" that many policies are predicated upon. Today, many policies have been formulated based upon a mix of Government controls and free market forces. Perhaps, we should challenge some of these premises today and ask ourselves whether our economy and the people are mature enough to let market forces have free and full play. I will touch on these in greater detail in the Committee of Supply. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the budget details, item by item. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Corporate Tax Rate</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corporate tax rate is held at 26% although the announced long term rate is 25%. I agree that at 26% today, we are already one of the lowest in the world, after Hong Kong, for corporate tax rate. Since we have brought this down to 26% only last year, I agree that there is no real urgency to bring it down further. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the longer term, however, I would like to ask the Minister for Finance to consider a multi-tier corporate tax rate that will help small local growing companies that need to plough back their profits into the business. For example, the first $2 million in taxable income could be taxed at, say, 15%, the next $3 million could be taxed at 20% and the rest above $5 million at the long term rate of 25%. In this case, local companies could be defined as companies with 100% Singaporean ownership. This concession could be given for an initial period of between five to 10 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are already helping many MNCs in Singapore in a similar way by granting them pioneer tax status for 10 years in the first instance. And this period, I am told, is sometimes extended depending on further investments made in their plants in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the financial sector, we have already introduced similar multi-tier corporate tax rates, although in their case, the tax rate is lower or even exempt for selected activities above a certain threshold. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Incentives for Financial Services Sector</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us do not begrudge the tax incentives given to the financial services sector to further attract high value-added activities, mega fund managers or reputable credit rating agencies to Singapore. In this way, we enhance the development of Singapore as an international financial centre. The question most frequently asked, however, is how do these tax incentives translate into benefits for Singaporeans. These tax incentives are mainly benefitted by the foreign financial firms. Although there are some requirements for some of these firms to employ a certain number of staff based in Singapore in order to qualify for these tax incentives, many firms simply transfer their expatriate staff from their home country to Singapore. Many of them bemoan the difficulty in recruiting qualified local staff but, at the same time, they are reluctant to train younger local staff for fear of job hopping among them once they are trained. So they simply poach from one another and drive up the wage costs in the process. There is therefore little transfer of technical expertise to our local people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Thailand, I am told, foreign financial institutions are restricted in the number of expatriates allowed to be brought in. I am not suggesting that we do likewise here, but I certainly feel that more training of younger staff should be undertaken so that our pool of qualified financial professionals can be increased in the long run. If all the firms involved are compelled to train younger local staff, there will be less fear of poaching among them. This is important if we want to add breadth and depth to our financial markets. So I hope the Minister for Finance will look into the possibility of linking some of these tax incentives to the imposition of some requirement to train younger local staff to add to our pool of financial expertise. In \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the longer term, this will also ease the tight labour market for financial professionals and make it easier to further attract more financial institutions to Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Overseas Enterprise Incentive (OEI)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OEI was introduced as part of the Government's effort to encourage Singaporean companies to regionalise. Thus far, the tax incentives are aimed at companies that are profitable, with income or dividends to remit home. The further relaxation of the OEI scheme is welcomed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies that venture overseas usually do not make profits in the initial years. Right now, their losses cannot be grouped together, although they can be carried over for a number of years at the individual company level. To further encourage regionalisation by local companies, the Minister may wish to consider allowing such companies to group their losses for an initial period of, say, five years, provided certain conditions are met. This will certainly help such companies to make longer term investment decisions overseas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government could also help local companies venturing into new markets, such as Vietnam, Myanmar and Cambodia by setting up insurance schemes for country risks to help reduce their exposure to risks arising from war, terrorism, rebellion, insurrection, coup d'etat, etc. These events are usually not insurable commercially. If available, they are either limited in coverage or the premium would be too hefty. Such Government support, I am sure, would be most welcome by many Singapore companies and would certainly encourage them to venture more boldly into new markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Changes for Individuals</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The across-the-board one-off rebate of 10% on individual income tax in the Year of Assessment 1997 is indeed a welcome relief for all of us, especially in a year of high property prices and escalating COE \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> prices. For many of us, it is probably not enough to pay for the increase in the COE prices since the beginning of the year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the Government for finally consenting to raise the income tax relief for dependants by a modest amount of $500. My only regret is that the Government did not use the opportunity to increase the allowable relief for wife to at least the same level as for our aged parents at about $3,500 to $4,500. Those of you who have wives who are not working and also aged parents to support will know what I mean. Why should a non-working wife who is active economically managing your home be given a tax relief which is lower than that for your aged parents? Will the Minister help explain the rationale for this? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I also fail to understand why the top marginal tax bracket for individuals should be maintained at 28%, which is 2% higher than the corporate tax rate of 26%. Today, very high net worth individuals who are affected will have tax consultants and private bankers to help them to minimise their tax exposure. The end result may be more funds being kept abroad in tax havens to minimise their tax burdens. I have some suggestions too on property tax, estate duty and tax reliefs to promote regionalisation, which I will touch upon in greater detail in the Committee of Supply. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Rebates on HDB Service and Conservancy and Rental Charges.</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rebates were introduced some years ago as a result of the GST offset package which made 70% of individuals non income tax payers. Although these rebates were initially meant to be one-off, the Government has been giving these rebates year after year now because of good budget surpluses. My concern is that we may soon have 70% of the population developing a welfare mentality as they come to expect this and other handouts such as Edusave, CPF top-up schemes and so on year after year. What I would like to see is for these rebates to be confined to the lower income only, ie, perhaps the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 1-roomers, 2-roomers and 3-roomers who are tenants or lessees who are more in need of financial aid. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Budget Surplus.</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I think it is commendable that we have a budget surplus year after year. Many countries with much heavier tax rates are still grappling with breaking even on their budget. Recently, I read that we have broken the record of having the biggest budget surplus in the whole world, both as a percentage of GDP as well as in absolute quantum. This is a dubious honour that I think we should look in greater detail. It could mean that we are collecting revenue way above the Government's spending needs, thereby taking away cash and hence liquidity from the economic system. The retailers would like to believe in this theory as they attribute the poor purchasing power of consumers to lack of disposable income on households who are committed to large mortgage payments on houses and their cars. If this theory is correct and liquidity is tight, then you expect the interest rate to be high, which is not. In my view, the weak retail sector is due to more than just poor disposable income. Our consumers here and those from neighbouring countries have become much more discerning and are going for greater value-for-money purchases elsewhere in the region and even further afield as more and more people travel abroad. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take a closer look at the details of the revenue breakdown, we will notice that $4.4 billion come from the Ministry of Communications, presumably from car and road taxes and COEs. This is more than the total estimated budget surplus of $4.09 billion for FY 97/98. Do these taxes take money out of the system? Obviously they do, as a dollar more spent on a car would be a dollar less spent on other goods. What are the long term implications of having large budget surpluses on our local economy year after year? I am not an economist and I do not know the full answer right now, but I share the sentiments of many that it must be taking away some of the vibrance and enthusiasm of living in Singapore and contributing to the perception that Singapore is a very expensive place to live in. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, Singapore also won another dubious honour of being among the most expensive cities for expatriate housing. It was quoted second to Hong Kong for property purchases relative to annual salary, and also second to Bombay for annual rental as a percentage of salary. This was the finding of a survey done recently by property consultant Knight Frank. I would like to suggest that the Committee on the Long Term Competitiveness of Singapore should also examine the long term implications of our large budget surpluses year after year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I suggest that the Ministry of Finance work harder to get the estimated budget surplus figure closer to the actual realised. If you look at the record of the last five years, our estimates have always been far too conservative, and have been off by several billion dollars every year. This year, for example, with an estimated surplus of $4.09 billion, I take it that the actual perhaps may be nearer to S$10 billion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this comment, I support the motion in the name of the Finance Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is obviously very focused on the financial sector. In fact, it has been called the \"Shenton Way Budget\". There are incentives for fund management, institutions involved in Asian Currency Unit operations, banks and merchant banks managing initial public offers in foreign currency shares, financial institutions that issue offshore debt issues and credit rating agencies. I see these incentives as ways to further strengthen Singapore's position as a regional financial centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, a few questions that many in the financial world are asking. For example, there are about half a dozen fund managers in Asia that manage about $10 billion dollars worth of funds and our minimum amount required to qualify for this Budget's tax exemption scheme. Also, there are not many banks that earn more than $50 million from ACU activities. Obviously, you have to be a very \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> big player before you can benefit from these incentives. Why is this so? There are many people asking this question and perhaps the Minister can answer this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, smaller and medium-sized companies in Singapore would not be able to benefit from the tax incentives from satellite operations and the building allowance for logistics operators. I wonder how many companies in Singapore have plans to launch satellites, or provide integrated logistics services which cover warehousing, distribution, information management and other high value added operators. It looks as if only huge companies can do that and benefit from the incentives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, manufacturers, retailers and property developers feel very let down by this Budget. They complain that the cost of doing business in Singapore is very high, and some of them move abroad and set up companies overseas. But many got their fingers burnt in the recent devaluation of the Thai baht, the Philippine peso and now probably the Indonesian rupiah and the Malaysian ringgit, which also took a down turn. These companies are hoping for the Minister to announce measures to bring down the cost of doing business. Of course, they are always concerned about the corporate tax, but we have already announced in the last budget that the corporate tax will be reduced for this year's tax concessions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think they are now turning to the Committee on the Long Term Competitiveness of Singapore Report early next year. I think they expect a lot of goodies, and I do hope by then they will get something. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in favour of more publicicity to be given to the more than $700 million to be spent on R&amp;D, the Cluster Development Fund of $300 million and the Economic Development Assistance Schemes administered by the EDB and other Government agencies for Singapore companies. Singapore is only adapting to change. We are not leaders. We have no products we can say that we developed them from our own R&amp;D. The West is still leading. They are the creators and inventors. We are just followers and adaptors. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holland, for example, is a small country by comparison to many other big western countries, and the population is not very big. But they have very good multi-national companies and they have very good original products and companies like Philips that are world renowned. Well, we hope that we can do something like that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here in Singapore, I am afraid that the present thinking on R&amp;D is that our R&amp;D is based on bottom line. But real breakthroughs often start from research for its own sake. These are the breakthroughs which dictate what the future markets will be which separate the leaders and the followers. I hope this $700 million R&amp;D fund will at least help some of these companies who want to embark on R&amp;D programmes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there were no announcements for a reduction in personal income tax, it was softened by a 10% tax rebate for the Year of Assessment 1997. I think Singaporeans should be satisfied with this, as in addition to the 10% rebate, there is also benefit on increases in certain of his personal allowances. As for those who do not pay taxes, the rebates and grants for citizen households staying in rental and owner occupied HDB flats are welcomed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in water rates, lower income families living in 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-room HDB flats will be granted a rebate on utility bills in 1997/1998. This, I am sure, will help these Singaporeans to offset the increases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there has been a lot of talk recently on creative thinking and I notice that the Ministry of Education will be given $19.4 million worth of money. I am sure a lot of this will be spent in this particular direction in our education. What do all these really mean? The term \"creative thinking\" necessarily implies that from time to time, old standards and old ideas will be challenged by new ones. And if we are committed to such a mood of thought, we must allow this challenge. This requires a change in the mindset of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> teachers who are teaching students and, of course, of civil servants who are running our many institutions and Ministries. There will be students who can solve, for example, mathematical problems in different and non-standard ways, and they should not be penalised for not following the teachers. Then there will be projects that need to be assessed by civil servants and because they are again non-standard, they are not given due consideration. Or perhaps our present rules and regulations do not allow such changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember there was one young man who came to me with a beautiful project and I passed this project to the URA. It was to deck the canal which is opposite Centrepoint. It was a beautiful project. I brought it to URA because I thought he had creative ideas. Unfortunately, it was turned down because our rules and regulations do not allow this particular project to be carried on in this manner. It must be tendered out. I am wondering when we start to have this trend, we are actually creating a lot of expectations in our population. They might come up with beautiful ideas but when they come to you, you say, \"Sorry, you have to tender out.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no answers for this, Mr Speaker, Sir, but I guess we have to start thinking and find ways to accommodate all these changes that will result from our new approach to teaching. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, finally, change must also come from the individual, ourselves, because a thinking individual is actually a responsible individual. If one is a victim of an offensive remark and because one is a thinking individual, one should have the maturity to brush it aside if it is not worthwhile rebutting. Or we could argue back in an objective, non-prejudiced manner without resorting to violence. Responsibility for one's action is important if our society wants to mature. It is always easy to put the blame on the Government for fear of not speaking up. I hope it is not used as an excuse for not speaking up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our multi-racial Asian society makes it even more so for the individual to be very careful in expressing his views, especially \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> if he refers to race or religion. Many of us who are old enough to experience the racial riots and also read about the Maria Hertogh riots will definitely want to make sure that such events will never happen again. I remember that as a medical student I had to take care of riot victims in hospital. I was really shocked and was very determined that it should not happen again. Maybe this is one of the reasons why I was drawn into politics, because we must not allow it to happen. But when Singaporeans are given this signal about creative thinking we should expect a lot more than what we are doing now as they might want to do more. But this is a challenge that we have to face. How we address it will be very difficult, but I think we must challenge it. Of course, as Asians, this question of face-saving is very important. Can our society therefore evolve to a stage where the right of the individual to speak and to express his views transcends all these things? That is the question I would like to ask our Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the economy of China is booming and the countries in the region are also making good economic progress. This means that Singapore is facing up to more competition from those countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the Government shall be spending more on economic and infrastructural development. There shall be a sizable increase of 68% over last year's spending. No one will quarrel with the Minister over this large additional expenditure to improve Singapore's business environment. This will put Singapore in a better position to meet the challenges from the other countries. But international organisations that report on world business competitiveness do not point to Singapore's infrastructural development as one of its weak points. The weak point in Singapore's economy is the low educational level of Singapore's workers and their low productivity. Singapore workers are the least educated among the so-called four tigers, namely, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Singapore has a workforce of about 1.8 million and nearly one-half of this workforce comprises workers who \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have not completed secondary school education. Out of this one-half, nearly 700,000 or about 40% of them have no or very little numeracy and literacy skills. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the low level of education of our workforce is not something new. It has been highlighted for many years, but the Government does not seem to be concerned about this problem. Low education of the workers is not just an economic problem but a problem about Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic progress of Singapore due to the low education of the workforce shall in some ways be hindered but, more importantly, a large section of our workers, with hardly any education, shall be condemned forever to a low or no cultural life with no chance of enjoying a richer and more fulfilling life. The Government should once and for all put its mind on this important task to solve the problem of low education among our workers. An educated worker can not only understand new methods of production but is also more disciplined and a better worker and, hence, more productive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked the Government to introduce compulsory education for our school-going children, but the Government thinks that it is not necessary. The Government's reason is that only about 2,900 children each year would be involved. To the Government, this number of school children who do not receive any education at all is small. But actually it is not a small number. It is about 6% of each year's intake of Primary 1 school children. Each cohort of children accepted into Primary 1 is about 46,000 in number. The Government should not take the attitude that since the number of children not attending school at all is only about 2,900, it is not worth enforcing a compulsory education scheme. If this is the approach, then this approach is wrong. It is important to make education compulsory, not because Singapore can afford to maintain such a system but, more importantly, to drive home to parents, especially among the lowly educated Singaporeans, that it is necessary to send their children to school. This is also the only way to stop parents from not sending their children to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> school. With compulsory education in place, the quality of our workforce shall surely improve with time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget surplus is about $4.1 billion. The Minister says that it is a modest surplus. This does not mean that the Government has collected less money from the people. The budget surplus is modest only because the Government has put large sums aside to embark on substantial capital works such as the North-East MRT line and other capital projects. The question is: can the people of Singapore maintain such a huge budget surplus year after year? It is definitely a burden on the people. Under the recent Constitutional amendments, the accumulation of budget surpluses has to be made. Each succeeding government will have to build up its own reserves, as it cannot use the surpluses accumulated by other governments, unless of course clearance is obtained from the President, and no self-respecting government would want to approach the President to release surpluses accumulated by other governments for its own use. So what are the implications of maintaining huge surpluses year after year? It would mean that costs to Singaporeans would be high. Of course, there will be less money being circulated among the people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every Government department has, by policy, been converted to Autonomous Agencies (AAs). These Autonomous Agencies have to be efficient, not only in the services they provide but also in financial matters. Ultimately, these Autonomous Agencies will have to be financially self-supporting and probably make a profit, if possible. If these AAs want to be financially self-supporting, they have to charge more for their services. This can be seen by the fact that the Government is going to collect $4.1 billion for FY 97 for fees and charges. This is an increase from the last fiscal year by $0.6 billion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also earns revenue from other sources other than from tax revenue and the fees it charges. The Government in fact makes huge profits \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> from the sale of land. Land sales are going to net for the Government about $18.5 billion in FY 97. Since the Government is the biggest vendor in the sale of land in Singapore, it is quite natural that the Government wants to maintain high prices of land in Singapore. This would mean that the prices of houses and flats in Singapore will remain high. High land prices will also mean high rentals. And, of course, high rentals would push up costs of doing business, and generally it will raise the cost of living. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget has many \"give-aways\" to HDB flat dwellers. Strictly, as I can see, the only real give-aways are the rebates for the service and conservancy charges which are paid to the Town Councils. Once these rebates are paid to the Town Councils they are paid for good. But as for the rebates for rentals, they are in fact the transferring of money of the Government from one of its pockets to the other, as the HDB is a Government-related body. The Government also shall be giving rebates on public utility bills. Again, there is really no loss to the Government because in the end the Government will be getting back much of the rebates paid out with higher water tariffs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, newspaper reports show that businessmen generally are disappointed with the Budget. They say that there is nothing good for them in this Budget. They are disappointed that the tax rate for both personal and corporate income tax rates were not cut and they remain at 27% and 26% respectively. As for the individual income taxpayers, generally they are not impressed with the tax reliefs. One Singaporean commented that the relief for the aged parents, which has been increased from $3,500 to $4,500, does not impress him. It would not be enough incentive for a person to get his parents to live with him and enjoy the $4,500. So those persons who have parents with them would just enjoy the tax relief as a matter of course. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government pensioners generally are also disappointed with the small increase in the Singapore Allowance. One Government pensioner has written to me to ask the Government to increase the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Singapore Allowance. The increase of $10 to him is manifestly too low. The cost of living has gone up and since the introduction of the 3% GST in April 1994, the $10 increase is not enough to cover the rising cost. I would ask the Minister whether he would consider increasing the Singapore Allowance by at least another $10. I am sure the Government can afford this. If we look at the bottom line, in fact, the net receipt by the Government is a whopping $12.6 billion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the motion standing in the name of the Minister for Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by any measure, our economy has done well. Although the economy has slowed down in 1996, after three years of strong growth, nonetheless, we have managed an overall growth of 7.6% for 1996. This, for a maturing economy, is quite commendable. We have been fortunate enough to register strong surpluses in our Budget with each passing year. We were able to accumulate such surpluses because of our sound budgetary policy. We do not spend more than we earn and our ability to earn comes from a combination of sound political leadership, wise economic judgment, a hardworking population, and a very successful industrialisation policy, a policy which since the early years is characterised by emphasis on sound infrastructural investments, and foreign investments in our country. In fact, it is the manufacturing enterprises, made up largely of the MNCs, that give us the impetus to bring us to where we are today. At this moment, manufacturing contributes towards 24% of our GDP. In employment terms, this translates itself to more than 365,000 jobs which the manufacturing industry provides for the people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget has been variously termed as a \"pro-family\" budget, a budget for the financial sector, and a \"no-surprises\" budget. However, for those in the manufacturing sector, much disappointment has been expressed because there is little in the Budget that they can be happy about. The consolation may well be that this is an interim budget. I would like to ask the Minister for Finance \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> whether our policies for the manufacturing sector will only be announced after the Government has studied the competitiveness report by the Government appointed Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is often said that the cost of doing business in Singapore today is high. The cost appears to be mounting and if we do not check our business costs, Singapore may lose its attractiveness as a place to do business in and, in the long term, this may affect our economic well being. Presently, if you look at the component of cost in the manufacturing sector, amongst the two biggest expenditure items are rental and labour. If you look at the recent figures published by the Department of Statistics, the unit business cost of manufacturing for the years 1986 to 1996 has risen by slightly more than 25%. On the other hand, just looking at the rate of return of US investment in Singapore in the non-oil manufacturing area, the figure fell from 35.3% in 1992 to 22.6% in 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I will be faulted for attributing part of the decline to the rise in the unit cost of manufacturing in Singapore. Sir, we should examine specific components of cost increases and see how these can be more effectively managed to make companies in Singapore more competitive in the world economy. The Government is aware and is as much concerned as we are with rising business cost, and I am sure this is an area which the Committee on Competitiveness will look into. In the same vein, I am not sure whether the solution is to cut income tax across the board as this does not sufficiently provide incentive or the challenge for companies to consider how they can be more productive and stay nimble on their feet. For the moment, the manufacturing sector, among others, may be held by a weaker Singapore currency. The weaker round of weakening of currencies in the region has no doubt affected the Singapore dollar. For many who see this as a sign of the weakening of the economies in the region, I see this as a positive sign, as a moderate weakening of our currency will help us to compete more effectively internationally. A strong Singapore dollar may not serve our purpose always as it will not help to push \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> our exports overseas. If our strategy is to rely on the manufacturing sector to contribute towards 24% of our GDP, a moderately weaker Singapore dollar will no doubt help to serve the purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we recognise that we have to push Singapore to the next level of economic development to make the Singapore dream a reality. We have accordingly restructured our economy by phasing out labour intensive industries and focusing more on high value-added capital intensive industries and financial services. Along similar lines, we have also embarked on a strategy of, I believe, moving to niche areas of specialisation and competence within our economy. For this reason, we have identified areas such as biomedical technology and wafer fabrication for development. Additionally, in recent years, we have been developing a second wing for our economy by encouraging Singaporeans to invest overseas, especially emerging economies like China, Vietnam, Myanmar and India. Today, our regionalisation efforts in these countries have been geared towards real estate related and manufacturing based activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these are no doubt some economic strategies that will help Singapore stay on course well into the 21st century. However, I feel that more can be and should be done for Singapore. We can ride on existing businesses and investments elsewhere to take us to the next level of development. Let me explain. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have amassed for ourselves a sizeable amount of reserves. This is no doubt due to the surpluses which we have accumulated over the years. Just for financial year 1997/1998 alone, our budget surplus is in the region of $4 billion. There are many companies, both in the West and the East, that are well established either in certain businesses or in certain cutting edge technology that we are trying to develop. It will be much to our advantage if we can acquire these businesses and in the process use their technology to give us a headstart in some areas, rather than to build the Microsofts, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Glaxco Wellcomes and the ICIs of Singapore from scratch. We can set aside some money in our reserves to acquire these companies. Acquiring these companies will give us a foothold into their business network and technological base. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Malaysian acquisition of the Lotus car manufacturer will provide some synergy for Hicom in the production of Proton cars. In our case, besides developing our own indigenous biomedical base, we can perhaps look at acquiring some of these leading biomedical companies in the world. This will give us a strategic advantage and headstart in this area. To prepare for this, we should perhaps send some of our best and brightest graduates to work for these companies. Their knowledge and experience will no doubt give us a better understanding of the operations of these companies and will help us with our acquisition, as these companies are already established with perhaps a sizeable share in the world market. The acquisition of these companies will allow us to integrate ourselves further into the world economy. It may also help these companies by using our local knowledge to break into this region. As far as I am aware, our investments thus far have been confined to portfolio share investments in various companies, such as investing in these companies, especially shareholders, rather than to consider a strategic acquisition of target companies or technology transfer to provide the foundation of economic development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of my foregoing comments, I would therefore be grateful if the Minister for Finance would enlighten us on whether our Government has a coherent strategy of acquisitions for the purpose which I have just suggested. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we stand at the threshold of the 21st century, we face a global economy that is increasingly integrated and highly competitive. In order for us to stay ahead of competition, we must be prepared, as we have done in the past, to undertake constant reviews of our paradigms. I share the concern of the Minister for Finance for our future economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> However, I am also optimistic that there are opportunities out there to be exploited. So long as we are prepared to see the world as a hunting ground for world class operations, the prospect will be bright indeed for us to rise above our constraints of size, limited resources and a small population base. For this reason, I beg to support the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion moved by the Finance Minister. The Budget this year is prudent and strategic in nature. It signals to all Singaporeans the slower growth in the economy in 1996 and focuses on certain sectors which the Government would like to \"champion\" at this point of time in view of the growing Asia-Pacific economies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, the Government is quite generous in giving rebates to all Singaporeans. Feedback from the HDB heartland have been generally positive. Residents are pleased to receive the utilities, service and conservancy charges, rental and the 10% individual tax rebates. These rebates clearly reflect the Government's commitment to create wealth and share success with all Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corporate level, the Budget has given a boost especially to the finance and communications sectors. I hope the incentives given will further encourage growth in these sectors, thus creating more high value-added job opportunities for Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cope with this potential growth, we need to provide more manpower for these sectors. More resources should be channelled to the respective training institutions to train more Singaporeans and upgrade our existing workforce in these industries. The Skills Development Fund must also be more generous towards companies in the finance and communications sectors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now discuss the S&amp;C grant provided by the Government for HDB residents. Town councils are indeed very grateful to receive this assistance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant will help town councils to reduce the impact of rising maintenance \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> costs on our residents. Over the years, town councils have been trying very hard to maintain the S&amp;C charges of HDB residents despite rising maintenance costs. Many town councils have adopted many initiatives to save energy, adopt more efficient repair methods and maximise the economy of scale in the management of HDB estates. Despite this, some town councils are facing the financial strain of increasing maintenance costs. The rise in maintenance costs is attributed to a number of factors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, manpower cost has increased over the years. The maintenance industry is faced with acute shortage of manpower, especially rubbish collectors, cleaners, and lift servicing technicians. The shortage of manpower and wage increase have increased the cost of maintaining HDB estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the rising expectations and demand of HDB residents have also contributed to the high cost of maintenance. New HDB flats are designed with a wide range of better quality materials and fittings to meet the needs of new flat owners. However, these new flats are also more costly to maintain. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, new flats are installed with lifts stopping at every floor. Although this is necessary, it has increased the cost of lift maintenance drastically. At present, the monthly maintenance fee for servicing a lift with three stops is about $180 per lift while the fee for a lift with 14 stops is $310 per lift. There is a difference of 72% in the servicing cost for these two different types of lifts. Thus, town councils which collect similar S&amp;C charges for various room types will have to bear the extra cost of lift maintenance for these newer flats which have lifts stopping at every floor. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the cost of spare parts for lifts is also increasing rapidly. Lifts in new flats are installed at the construction stage and handed over by HDB to town councils for maintenance. Town councils have no choice but to accept whatever brand of lifts as selected by HDB. As such, we have a wide range of different types of lifts servicing the estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the lifts are specialised in nature and can only be serviced by the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> respective companies using their specified spare parts. As such, town councils are unable to enjoy much economy of scale or obtain competitive cost in lift maintenance. I hope that HDB will look into the rising cost of lift maintenance as faced by all town councils. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the installation of many new fittings and finishings in newer flats has also increased the cost of maintenance. For instance, new flats are installed with aesthetically pleasing light fittings at common areas. These fittings are costly to replace and are frequently vandalised or stolen, thus increasing the cost of maintenance. For example, a 2 ft fluorescent tube in an existing flat costs about $1.20 to replace, while a light fitting in a new flat costs about $12 to replace. Thus, it costs the town council 10 times more to replace a light fitting in new flats. Furthermore, new flats are installed with a wide range of different types of light fittings. This has also made it difficult for town councils to source for these light fittings and enjoy economy of scale in maintaining these fittings. I hope HDB will conduct a study to determine whether HDB residents really prefer to have these new light fittings and are willing to pay higher S&amp;C charges for these features. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope the above examples will enable Singaporeans to understand the high cost of maintaining HDB estates and appreciate the good work done by the town councils. This is particularly so for those town councils which manage a large number of flats and thus are able to share the savings achieved through economy of scale with the residents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the S&amp;C grant provided by the Government, town councils will be able to minimise the impact of rising maintenance cost on the residents, especially the 1-, 2- and 3-roomers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek a point of clarification from Dr Teo? In his speech, he mentioned that the S&amp;C grant to residents would help the town councils. Firstly, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> would he clarify how does this grant help the town councils? Secondly, is this grant given directly to the town councils or the residents? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> From what I understand, the grant will be given to the town councils but it is meant for the residents. Basically, it is to help rising maintenance cost. Of course, the residents will be able to enjoy the S&amp;C grant because, without this grant, the residents may be faced with more increases in S&amp;C charges. So with the Government helping the town councils to shoulder some of their operating costs, this will lighten the burden on the residents. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, a point of clarification. Is the grant meant for the residents or the town councils? If the grant is meant for the town councils, which means that the town councils would actually receive the grant, the residents will still pay the same charges. But if the grant is for the residents, they will pay less. So which is which? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> The grant is for the residents. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Which means the town councils will not get any additional grants. How does the grant help the town councils? The residents will pay less, ie, they will enjoy the grant, but not the town councils. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Just to clarify again. Although the S&amp;C grant will be given to the residents, based on the different room types, it will be paid to the town councils and the residents will benefit. What I am trying to say is that, technically speaking, yes, with this S&amp;C grant, the residents will enjoy the grant directly. But if you look at the trend of maintenance cost and the last revision of the S&amp;C charges for HDB estates, you will note that town councils are facing financial strains because of rising maintenance cost. So you will find that, with this grant, theoretically, the town councils will have to increase the S&amp;C charges by a certain rate. But with this rebate, the increase will be minimised. What I am trying to say is that the S&amp;C grant by the Government will minimise the impact of any potential increase in S&amp;C charges on the residents. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the tone of this year's Budget Statement is consistent with our larger goals of achieving a stable growth pattern. As echoed by several Members already, the incentives directed at promoting the financial services sector would further reinforce the establishment of Singapore as a regional business and financial hub. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make two comments on how we can position ourselves in the light of intensifying competition as these issues were not specifically addressed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Managing our Resources</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has expended substantial efforts in arriving at a judicious mix of industry and services which would allow us to maximise the potential of available resources and capital, and consequently growth possibilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is well known already, unlike other countries, we do not have a large domestic market or a greater hinterland to supply to. Hence, to stay relevant, we have to constantly be nimble-footed and be willing to restructure our industries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we face supply constraints, particularly to labour. We can, through religious and forward planning, adapt other factors of production to changing needs. In this regard, I would like to urge the Government to devote yet more effort to the difficult challenge of moulding the attitudes of the labour force, so as to better cope with changing demands. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is inevitable that with a tight labour supply, employees are frequently in a good bargaining position, but only to a point. If a wage spiral forms, and consumption levels climb in tandem, any forced cutting back would be very painful. This could easily be precipitated by a loss of competitiveness when our wages rise too high too quickly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;London-based consultant Charles Handy, in his book entitled \"The Empty Raincoat\", offered a half-two-three concept to maintaining productivity and profitability, that is, keeping half as many employees but who are paid twice as \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> much and who are expected to produce three times as much. If we can manage on only half as many people for existing businesses, we can then hope to do more despite our limited manpower resources. However, we would also need to ensure that overall productivity has risen as well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a current fear that the wage level part of the equation may have risen ahead of the other two components. Whilst there is still a premium to be paid for good quality, top-notch managerial resources in Singapore, this has to be justified by a real superiority in delivery. There is a fine line between demanding what we think we are worth individually in a tight labour market and being priced out of the global market as a country. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Awareness of Sources of Competition</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has frequently been making comparisons between Singapore and other countries in Asia, in a bid to remain competitive. Amongst other things, it is heartening to note that the Government is closely monitoring the costs of doing business in Singapore. I would like to urge Government agencies to complement absolute comparisons with relative ones and with as many as possible as far as it is feasible to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate. There is sometimes a false sense of comfort that prime office rates in Hong Kong at around US$9-10 per square foot per month are still a good 30% above ours. However, utilisation also tends to be higher in Hong Kong, so the total rental burden may be the same, and our cost-advantage is neutralised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or for that matter, prime retail rentals in Hong Kong of as much as US$50 per square foot per month are about double that of comparable space in Singapore. This, unfortunately, does not paint a complete picture. Retail sales for high traffic outlets can average up to US$1,900 per square foot per year in Hong Kong against an average of around US$600-800 per square foot per year here, which will more than compensate for the costlier space. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore important for us to be familiar with the cost profile of businesses \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in Singapore and elsewhere. For example, is the real estate component, whether as a percentage of overall costs or revenues, disproportionally higher in Singapore? If it were true for certain industries, then, given our scarce land resources, we would have to restructure those industries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to extend this discussion to competition posed by the other non-Asian emerging markets. Asia is without doubt a success story and would continue to be for a while, particularly in countries with good economic governance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as part of Asia, we should not dismiss the renewal of interest in some parts of the Latin American, Eastern European and African markets. Rampant or hyper-inflation woes in Latin America are giving way to steady, well-controlled inflation patterns, and growth rates for 1998, for example, are projected to be just a shade below Asia's estimated average of between 6% and 7%. Investment opportunities abound given their relatively low GDP per capita levels. It is thus not surprising that North American and European investors have begun hunting such possibilities, somewhat at the expense of Asia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Asia as a whole loses its allure, then Singapore would have to contend with a share of a smaller pie and intra-Asia competitive pressure. One way of further diversifying our economic base is to explore ways of participating in the growth of these markets, on a selective basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Budget Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the Minister for Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the 1997 Budget announced by the Minister for Finance is a conservatively optimistic, prudent and painless Budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early months of 1997, the sluggish export activities of our electronics industry and the slowing down of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> our manufacturing sector have led to a slower growth in the economy of Singapore. In the first quarter of 1997, we only managed to register a 3.8% economic growth. Furthermore, the regional currencies crisis has indeed hit the ASEAN financial markets. Except for the Singapore dollar which is not so seriously affected , other currencies, such as the Thai baht, Philippine peso, Indonesian rupiah and Malaysian ringgit, are being dumped by speculators causing their exchange rates to plummet. In addition, the rapid economic growth in ASEAN countries and the Asia-Pacific region has created dynamic and competitive financial markets among these countries. In my view, taking into account both external and internal factors, the Minister for Finance is very prudent and has kept in line with the present economic situation of Singapore when he presented our economic outlook as conservatively optimistic. Another important element mentioned in the Budget is the sharing of our surplus with the people, for example, the rebates on HDB service and conservancy charges and rentals, rebates for utilities charges, CPF Medisave Top-Up Scheme, Pre-Medisave Top-Up for Senior Citizens and another one-off 10% across-the-board rebate in personal income tax, etc. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget was well tailored to take into consideration the land cost of industrial land and residential properties. The Government recognises that the cost of industrial land is a key issue for investors in the manufacturing sector. Therefore, the Government has taken cautious steps to allocate adequate land for industrial use and to price industrial land realistically to keep Singapore an attractive destination for investments. In the financial services sector, a package of new tax incentives and tax concessions are worked out for activities, such as fund management, management of initial public offerings (IPO) of foreign-currency shares, trading in foreign-currency shares, etc. These incentives will boost economic growth in the commercial sector. It will also help to keep Singapore stay competitive as we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> step into the next century. Therefore, I feel that this Budget can be described as objectively optimistic with dynamism. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore, among our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the majority are small factories, retail shops and small-time operators. These people are being pressurised as they face stronger competition, and they are at the same time affected by the slower Singapore economic growth. These businesses often encounter niggling problems. Recently, JTC froze the rental of their properties to help these small enterprises. We welcome such a move. At the same time, I hope that the Housing and Development Board will also follow the footsteps of JTC in freezing their rental increases. I also urge the Ministry of the Environment to consider freezing rental increases on the hawker stalls to help the small-time operators alleviate their operational cost, especially in the aging estates like Queenstown, Tanjong Pagar, Geylang West and Bukit Ho Swee. These shopkeepers and stallholders are not enjoying good business but they have to pay high overhead expenses. So, we should pay special attention to them and I hope the Minister for Finance will understand the plight of these small traders and ask the HDB and the Ministry of the Environment to consider our appeal to them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore, the big enterprises are usually public-listed companies and multi-national corporations (MNCs). Should they require additional capital to expand their business, they can easily approach the banks for loans or through public offerings of shares. Yet, in coordinating with the Government's policy of encouraging overseas development, they are often over-cautious because of their own company policies. On the contrary, some of our local small and medium-sized companies are very adventurous and are more prepared to take risks. Their flexibility and adventurous spirit will positively develop not only the local business but also their overseas investments. I believe that if the Government imposes less restrictions and conditions on them, they \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will definitely be able to develop into big enterprises and corporations in one to two decades. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is encouraging small and medium-sized enterprises to extend their business overseas and assisting them by setting up SME Investment Funds. However, according to the professionals in this field, enterprises who really benefited from these schemes are really very few. At the moment, many medium-sized enterprises investing overseas in industrial parks, lands, buildings, etc., are having difficulty securing loans from local banks. Even by investing a capital of $1 million in fixed assets, they are still unable to secure a bank loan of $200,000 or 20% of the capital. I find this very difficult to understand. The bankers told me that they had to abide by the regulation of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. If this is the case, I hope that the Ministry of Finance would take into consideration the situation of the medium-sized enterprises by giving the Singapore financial institutions more liberty and allow them to grant mortgage loans to Singapore enterprises against their tangible assets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, we can encourage greater economic growth and better overseas development outlook for our local SMEs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to sum up, this year's Budget will benefit our country. It will help Singapore maintain its competitive edge and ensure the positive growth of the economy of Singapore in the next few years. It is indeed a prudent Budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Budget Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new millennium, a crucial challenge is to maintain Singapore's competitiveness. Competition will intensify world wide. As developing economies improve, in particular, our neighbours, they will compete with us in more areas including those that we are traditionally strong. As our own economy develops, we will also compete more with the developed countries. This pressure will be exacerbated by rapid technological advances, especially in information technology. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world will change perhaps in ways that we may not imagine. How do we prepare for this future? Although we may not be able to say exactly what the future will look like, we know the broad trends, the major drivers and the qualities we need to survive in such a world. We have to anticipate the changes we have to make as a society and take steps to bring about the needed change in our people. We have to be forward looking. By the look of things to come, bold changes will be needed. Tinkering with the system by fine-tuning it may not be enough. We already have a tight efficient system. We must change not just to make it run better for we must change because we expect the paradigm to shift. This will require a quantum leap of mind and effort. The quality of our people will make the difference. It will decide the winner. It will provide the sustaining edge. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to see that more money has been allocated for education and training. Give our people the avenues to acquire more knowledge and skills. There is much wisdom in teaching a person to fish. Creativity and thinking skills will be important. However, we must preserve in our people the virtues of hard work and the mental attitude to prevail and persevere over adversities and difficulties. Information technology will be important. The ability to assess and use information will be crucial. The Budget recognises the need for change as provisions are made for more IT in the schools and research and development. We must also teach Singaporeans to love family, fellow Singaporeans and country. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we make decisions, we must maintain the rational approach. Our head must be in charge. We must adopt a long term view, but the heart has its place and must not be forgotten. We must temper decisions we make with the coldness of the head with the feelings of the heart. We must take cognizance of the short term impact of the decision on our people. In other words, we must smoothen out the rough edges to reduce the pain to the people when the decision is implemented. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> We have to help the weaker among us to cope with the changes while encouraging our able to fly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handling of the increases in water rates in the Budget reflects this tempered approach. Water is a crucial resource for the nation. References to our water supply during the recent difficult period with our neighbour clearly drove home this point. We must make Singaporeans take the importance of water seriously. We need to price water realistically to reflect its importance as previous campaigns to persuade our people to use water carefully did not have a lasting effect. When Singaporeans see their August utility bills, they will see water costing more. However, the Government knows that this increase will cause difficulties to those with low income. Hence, rebates on utility bills were provided for in the Budget. For those living in 1- to 4-room HDB flats, the rebates will be sufficient to pay for the increase and they will not have less disposable income. Hence, the pain will be ameliorated for those with lower income. But since they can keep their money for something else if they lower their use of water, this will encourage them to use less water. The continuance of the rental and S&amp;C rebates and the addition of the monthly utility and S&amp;C grants to HDB houses are also to make it easier for those with lower income, but we must be more careful as the rationale is less clear. We must be careful not to unwittingly create a welfare mentality among Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefit of prudence in our national budgetting philosophy is borne out recently by the run on the currencies of our neighbouring countries. The Singapore currency withstood this difficult period better than the baht, peso, rupiah and ringgit. This episode, which does not appear to have ended, shows that the ASEAN economies need to be further strengthened. Our economies are very much interdependent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While competition between ASEAN nations is inevitable, there are many areas that we can and should cooperate. Competition is good because in the process, we better ourselves. But if we also cooperate, we will raise our collective \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ability to compete more effectively with other regions and countries in the world. Besides, it is always better to have rich neighbours and to live in a prosperous region. Nevertheless, this interdependence means that our economic performance is likely to be affected by the currency problem. What will be its impact on the performance of our economy this year? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will succeed and prosper if we pull together in the same direction. We did it in the past when our means were scarce. Prudence and care in our national budgetting has helped. We are better equipped now. We will do it better and we will do it in style. Everyone will have a stake in the country, its future and its prosperity and wealth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that remark, Sir, I support the Budget Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I echo what was said by the first speaker? I asked this in a Question and you disallowed it, but may I just say that, as he himself said, we are more than three months late in discussing this Budget Statement. We hope that we may have some explanation as to why we have had to wait till July to debate this Budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may move on to the Budget. I do not wish to repeat what has been said by speakers before me, except perhaps to underscore some of the matters that have been said. As has been said, this Budget - what one has come to expect from this Government, and which I knew when I was in the House years ago - is long on generalities and very short on practical \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> suggestions on what should be done for the economy of the country. It is very long on generalisations that we should do this, we should do that, we should be careful, but nothing is said about what the Government proposes to do. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says the outlook for 1997 is \"cautiously optimistic\". I wish he had gone on to elaborate a little bit further on what he meant by \"cautiously optimistic\". Others have said before me that many a Singaporean do not share the view that the economy is taking off again. In fact, the people that I have spoken to and, of course, I speak to the middle or the small businessmen, a lot of them are very pessimistic about the future for their business and the country, and a number of them think there will be a further slowdown, which has been already said by others. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of all this, what is the Government planning to do even though it may be a small recession or a slowdown in the country's economy? The Minister says in his Budget Speech, and I quote him, just this phrase, \"there is no choice but to stay internationally competitive\". Elsewhere he says, \"we must watch the overall cost of doing business in Singapore\". Again elsewhere, he says, \"labour costs in Singapore are high too\". But what the Minister dismally fails to answer is whether the Government has any part in the efforts that are to be made to see that we remain competitive and that we are not priced out of the market for our goods and services. Many have spoken and I think it is public knowledge - it does not need repeating - that the cost of doing business in Singapore has risen and is rising. What has the Government got to say about this? Has the Government any proposals to see that not only the cost does not rise, but it can perhaps be reduced? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was about two years ago after the PSA increased its handling charges or rates, sitting at a small restaurant I heard some people (they were expatriates who must have been in the importing or shipping business) talking that Singapore was becoming too expensive and that the PSA stood for \"Please Stay Away from Singapore\". The PSA was saying, \"do not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> come in, we are going to charge you very high rates.\" It is not only the rates that are being charged to people doing business in Singapore, but it is also the fees and charges that are being made for services rendered by the Government. Something has been said about the fees and I think it was Mr Chiam who spoke on the very substantial increase in the fees and charges. Has the Government not got anything to say about this? Does it still propose to maintain the fees and charges at the present level? Or does it propose to try to reduce them so that the burden on people doing business is lightened even a little bit? So I think we should hear from the Minister what is the Government's contribution or what is the Government's part in helping Singapore to remain competitive? Or is it to be left to the businessmen, with the Government's exhortations, \"Oh, you must be competitive. You must keep your prices down.\"? We have heard enough of that. What we want from the Government, to develop Singapore, is to set an example. The Minister has talked about the labour costs in Singapore and about the lack of skilled labour, expert workers in Singapore. And Mr Chiam has rightly pointed out the educational level of our workers. What does the Government plan to do about this? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is no good preaching to the workers that they must improve themselves, they must acquire new skills, they must learn more to remain in their jobs. Has the Government considered at all running workers' classes at no cost to the workers, providing them free education, especially for workers who may not find it possible to meet the cost of education to better themselves? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Chiam has pointed out, a great proportion of our workers have not even got the basic education that is needed. Will the Government consider starting workers' classes for them to improve? But it is not just that, Mr Speaker, Sir. I was talking only yesterday to two Ministry of the Environment workers in the area where I am living, and they are grass-cutters and road sweepers. When I asked them, \"How much are you paid?\", they \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> told me, \"Well, Mr Jeyaretnam, at the end of the month we take home the princely sum of $600.\" \"Oh,\" I said, \"that's a lot, isn't it?\" This is after payment of the CPF and other things. So I said, \"What do you do then?\" They said, \"Well, the moment we leave here, we have got to run on to other jobs. We finish work at 2 o'clock or 2.30. Then we start another one at 3.00.\" And they go on till 10 in the night? So what time do they have to improve themselves when they have to work for 12-14 hours a day, just to keep themselves and their families going? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government collects huge sums in foreign worker levy. What is this foreign worker levy being put to use? Is it not possible for that to be set apart to improve the workers' skills and give them the basic education that is needed? The Minister says that they have recently cut the foreign worker levy for the manufacturing sector. But the question that arises, Mr Speaker, Sir, is if we do not have the skills in our workers, and we need the skills and the expertise brought in by foreign workers, then is it right that we should make the companies doing business pay and incur further costs by paying the levies? Is it not time to reconsider the whole question of foreign worker levy? I am not saying that it should be for all, but you have to try to come to some judgment as to how much, what is the need of foreign workers in Singapore's economy? And if that is so, then should it not be made easier for those who need them to bring them into Singapore? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may move on to the expenditure policy of this Government. No one will quarrel with the Government when it says it will exercise prudence as the cornerstone of its expenditure policy. And no one will quarrel with expenditure to improve the infrastructure and the economy of the country. But is it not time, Mr Speaker, Sir, that we should also make an attempt to see whether all the expenditure, not on the development or the infrastructure expenditure, but particularly the administrative expenditure, can be cut down now? It does not follow that because we are able to show budget surpluses year after year, running into billions of dollars, that we should be spending money when it could be put to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> better use. We have got to, first of all, have a scale of priorities in the expenditure of our monies. It is the people's monies. What merits the highest priority? Of course, education does. I see the new British Labour government has put education as number one in its top priority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I ask: is there a need to examine this question of cutting down on some of the administrative costs of governing us? We are after all, Mr Speaker, Sir, a nation built upon about 3 million people, smaller than many of the big cities. And we have, to govern us, 16 Ministers, three Senior Ministers of State, five Ministers of State, two Senior Parliamentary Secretaries and three Parliamentary Secretaries. Could we look into this question as to whether this is really necessary? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I move into some posts. We have a Minister without portfolio. Could the people of Singapore be told what exactly is the Minister without portfolio being paid for? What is the work that he is doing that the Singapore taxpayers have been called upon to pay his salary amounting to almost a million dollars a year, without being told exactly what is it that he is doing for his salary? Then we have three Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office. We have, of course, the Prime Minister. Then we have the Senior Minister and one Deputy Prime Minister attached to the Prime Minister's Office. Could we be told exactly what is it that these Ministers are doing? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister, we read from time to time, is often overseas. And I have asked for the amount of money that has been spent on travels and I have been given some figures, and I may come back to it later in the Committee of Supply debate. But may we know exactly what the Senior Minister does? We know that he goes abroad, as I said, from time to time, preaching to the other countries about democracy not being viable or desirable for Asian societies which a departing governor describes as being fit for the birds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then we have got two Ministers in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Do we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> really need two Ministers in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? I must not be taken to be cavilling, but it is not just the Ministers. I think I mentioned some years ago that a Japanese economist wrote that Singapore was a place of high salaries and low wages. We should look at the whole salary structure in Singapore, not only Ministers but of the top civil servants, the judges and the others, to see whether perhaps we are paying them too much. So I would ask that we do examine our expenditure or some attempt be made to examine the expenditure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may move on, Mr Speaker, Sir. I told the Straits Times - a reporter rang me up four or five days ago, I do not often speak to this press, they know it, but he must have caught me in one of my generous moods and I responded. This is, as has been said, a budget that favours the big companies, the MNCs and the rich men in Singapore. It is not a budget for the ordinary working man. He does not see any joy in this budget. The Minister says, \"We had 7% growth in 1996. It is good and is due in no small part to the hard work and enterprise of our people.\" It is enterprise of our people, the entire nation, I hope, not just a select few. And then he goes on to say, \"I have decided to reward their effort.\" Now, how does this Santa Claus of our nation reward the people? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says that he proposes to give a rebate of 10% in the income tax paid by our people. But he goes on to say that 70% of our people do not pay income tax. So the rebate does not, on his own admission, do anything for this 70%. How could they say? It is not because of the GST. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Labour Force Survey of 1996, you will find that 62.5% of our employees earned below $2,000 per month. I have obtained from the Income Tax Department a table on the income tax paid, and I found that if you had a chargeable income of $14,603, then you do not pay any income tax. That is why they are not paying any income tax because they are too poor. So who is going to benefit by this 10% rebate in the income tax? Again, from the Income Tax Department, in an appendix setting out \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the assessment made up to 31st March 1996, I find that 385 residents in Singapore, each had an assessable income of more than $1 million a year. They would each get a rebate, as promised by the Minister, on an average, of $56,913 each. Not everyone is going to get that. It is an average. You divide the amount of the whole rebate for 385 and you get that figure. And he says that the 10% rebate will cost the nation $250 million. So who is he rewarding? He is rewarding, without any question, Mr Speaker, Sir, the wealthy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, your time is up. Mr Zainul Abidin. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion in the name of the Minister for Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that, I must say that it is quite a task having to speak after Mr Jeyaretnam. It can be quite disorienting, in terms of the mind, and sometimes it makes me wonder whether we are sitting in the same Parliament, or in the same Singapore, for that matter. Here, we have nine other speakers responding to the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement, asking questions, suggesting improvements, refinements and yet we are told that the Budget Statement is nothing but long on generalities and short on what the Government is expected to do. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, when it came to the President's Address, the same tack was taken that the Address was nothing in preparing the people for the 21st century and was thrown out. But yet we are now back facing the same kind of tenor, same kind of questioning on things which had been asked before, which should have been answered before, but yet we have to listen to the same tune all over again. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I move on to my comments proper, I would just like to comment on one aspect of Mr Jeyaretnam's comment and that was on PSA. Since I am also on the PSA Board and representing the Singapore Port Workers' Union, I would like to reassure \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Mr Jeyaretnam and Members of the House that, in fact, PSA is very prepared for the challenges and competition that are coming our way and that is the reason why PSA is corporatising. It is precisely to meet that kind of challenge and I am confident that we will meet the challenge squarely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I was last in Hong Kong in May, during the drive from the airport to the hotel, I could not help but notice the sorry state of affairs of many of the apartment buildings that line the route. They were dirty and dilapidated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought flashed my mind. How lucky we Singaporeans are. Not only is our policy on maintenance of buildings in place but we are fortunate to have the kind of reserves and budget surpluses to allow the Government to implement our IUP and MUP Programmes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I would like to make here, Sir, is that, thanks to the Government's budget policy, Singapore has had a healthy budget surplus for some time now. According to the World Competitiveness Yearbook of 1997, Singapore runs the world's highest budget surplus in 1995, both in terms of percentage of GDP and in dollar terms. It registered 15.5% of the GDP in 1995 at US$9.1 billion. In fact, it has had a surplus for many years. And this trend is likely to continue in the years ahead. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Hon. Minister for Finance, Dr Richard Hu, that, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"we have a robust fiscal position and a sound economic framework . and that the Government has managed the economy prudently, accumulating those surpluses\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some people may have wondered if too much money was being set aside for a rainy day, I feel that there is no harm, when the rain could turn into a monsoon, even though it seems unlikely in the near future. There are others who will say that the growing surpluses are because of too much taxes. That is surely worthy of review and worthwhile checking upon for we certainly would not want our Singaporeans to feel that they are over-taxed. Perhaps, the Hon. Minister for Finance could best answer that, for I am \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sure he would be the first to remedy that situation if he thought the consequences would be detrimental to Singapore's economic growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth reminding ourselves that although this proposed Budget comes with the lowest surplus since 1992, it has not stopped the Government from giving out the goodies to the people. After all, there is the Government's promise to share and plough back part of the surpluses to the people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is: what is the Government's policy, philosophy if you like, behind the question of what constitutes a fair surplus? When does the surplus get `overdone' and become counterproductive? What are the possible minefields? On the other hand, what is the Government's guiding principle, in terms of sharing the `manna' with the people? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this Budget proposal, is it right to say that nearly $1 billion or about a quarter of the surplus will be given out in various forms, mostly in terms of income tax rebates for all and assistance for the needy and the lower-middle income earners? While it is generous to many Singaporeans, it is inadequate to others, including those from the private sector who were hoping for more incentives to boost certain lagging sectors or to make them more competitive. Perhaps, the Hon. Minister would like to explain why he could not do more for the business sector and whether his hands were temporarily tied while awaiting the outcome of the Economic Committee on Competitiveness' recommendations. Admittedly, much has been done for the financial sector but what about the industrial sector where the SMEs were reported to be grasping for breath while waiting for some goodies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many will agree with Dr Hu that \"the aim is not to seek palliatives for current problems\" nor are they in a terminal stage, seeking advance monetary directives. But was there not room for some booster injections in the interim? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, in the spirit of Racial Harmony Day today, I wonder whether the Government could not do more for `social \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> therapy' to help foster a more cohesive Singapore. I know a substantial budget has been set aside for the new and old CDCs, the PA and programmes such as Sports for the People, but certainly more could be done for the self-help groups in their efforts at community upliftment, especially those who have proven to be a boon to society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to end here, Sir, on a harmonious note by thanking you and other Members of the House for their patience, tolerance and understanding. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in this debate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget for 1997/98 bears the hallmarks of this Government's policy on financial management - prudence, equity and incentives for wealth creation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of prudence, I was in fact about to commend the Government for the way it has been able to keep its operating expenditure below 10% of GDP but I was somewhat perplexed by the point made by the NCMP. I think if he were to draw a comparison with any mature economy and most of our regional economies, he will find that 10% compares most favourably. The forecast for 1997/98 is 9.6% of GDP which is the same for the previous year and allowing for some extraordinary items. I think that is no mean feat in an era when Government agencies are under increasing pressure to provide a wider range of services at ever higher quality. So I would like to commend the Government on its prudence in being able to restrain expenditure. Indeed such notable frugality on the expenditure side compels one to turn to the usual suspects to explain why we have a \"modest\" budget surplus of $4.8 billion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point the NCMP makes is that there is not much joy in this Budget for the average Singaporean. I suspect this must be due to some selective reading on his part, because I do have here some numbers which I thought were a good sign in this regard. Government has been fairly generous in the redistribution of income amongst Singaporeans in this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Budget. A sum of $420 million has been set aside for the S&amp;C and rental rebates, utility and S&amp;C grants and the Medisave Top-Up schemes. In addition, $500 million will be given to the Endowment Fund for Edusave and $100 million for Medifund. These are not insignificant amounts and I do believe that they will bring joy to the hearts of many average Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the additional reliefs for parents, wife, children and the 10% rebate, Mr Jeyaretnam dismisses them as payments to the rich or the well-off. I disagree with him. I look at them as incentives to the wealth creators in our economy. Unless the top 25% are rewarded and given incentives to perform, we will not have the wherewithal to do all the other socially desirable programmes that Mr Jeyaretnam and others desire. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on incentives for companies, the tax changes for companies are notable for their focus in terms of sectors and scale. Clearly, the Minister is desirous to focus on a few key sectors such as finance, logistics and satellite operations for fiscal incentives. Two questions beg to be asked. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first, which has been repeated several times, is what about the manufacturing sector which accounts for one-quarter of our GDP, the small and medium-sized enterprises who are deemed to be our indigenous engines of growth and the ailing retail sector? The Budget is conspicuous by its silence on this front. There is, however, a hint - and I assume that it is a hint - from the Minister's Statement that these and other sectors have not been forgotten. In his Statement, he mentioned the establishment of an Economic Committee to study the important issue of Singapore's long term competitiveness. In particular, this Committee is charged with identifying long term solutions and strategies to address the underlying challenges that Singapore has to overcome. Perhaps March 1998 or sooner may bring forth more good news for these groups. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question pertains to the qualifying criteria which appear to be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> rather stringent. A case in point is the tax incentive for the fund management industry. To qualify, a fund manager must be managing at least the equivalent of S$10 billion of non-resident funds in Singapore, employ at least seven professional fund managers and analysts, and have a track record of three years operating in Singapore under the tax exemption scheme for fund management. I would appreciate it if the Minister could let us know how many fund managers based on current data would qualify for such incentives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to turn to the social policy embodied in the Budget Statement. It is reassuring to note from the Minister's Statement that the Government continues to accord high priority to the fostering of a cohesive, resilient, caring and gracious society. This commitment is backed by the allocation of the largest share, 38%, of the overall budget to social and community services. This group of services accounts for 39% of operating expenditure and 41% of development expenditure for FY 97/98. The fiscal priority accorded to Community Development, Health, Environment and National Development is fitting, given that these investments in our people and their living environment are likely to yield the most durable returns for our country. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus, in particular, on the resource allocation to the Government's family and support services programme. This programme is responsible for the provision of services for child welfare, child care, senior citizens, the disabled and destitute, family welfare and a host of other social services. Increasingly, such services are being rendered through community organisations including the Community Development Councils, self-help groups, Citizens' Consultative Committees and voluntary welfare organisations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was particularly pleased that the allocation for this programme will increase by nearly 24%, from $138 million in FY 96/97 to $172 million in FY 97/98. The absolute figure may be modest but the rate of increase is heartening. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even as we allocate more financial resources to these essential services, I \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> would urge the Government to review the basis on which financial support is given to the community organisations that deliver the services. Today, the Government policy is to finance 90% of approved capital expenditure and 50% of recurrent expenditure. This approach is based on the principle of co-payment to ensure that the recipients of such support also bear a share of the costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in principle, I have no objections to this approach. However, I do believe that it needs moderation in practice, because it imposes a considerable, at times onerous, financial burden on these community groups. Many a volunteer has remarked to me that if he or she is not busy selling donation draw tickets, he or she is busy buying them or participating in a walk-a-jog. It is the perennial problem of too much charity chasing a finite pool of funds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem will be exacerbated as Government, true to its motto of \"Many Helping Hands\", devolves more services to community organisations. For example, CDCs will be responsible for the Rent and Utilities Assistance Scheme and Financial Assistance Scheme, formerly administered by the Ministry of Community Development. The community organisations have also increasingly taken on the responsibility of running Family Service Centres, Student Service Centres and the like. Their recurrent expenditure will inevitably rise and with it their fund raising needs. It also raises invidious questions as to whether through such devolution, Government is also seeking to divest itself of the fiduciary responsibility for such services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge the Government to adopt a different basis for extending financial support to community organisations. Government could first identify a cluster of core services or programmes that it deems to be an essential part of the national social development programme. Such services, and the organisations rendering them, should then be given financial assistance invoking the principle of co-effort instead of co-payment. There would be an implicit contract whereby Government undertakes to absorb the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> bulk of the financial cost of providing such services, say, up to 90% of recurrent cost, and the community organisations in turn undertake to mobilise the volunteer manpower and meet certain qualitative and quantitative standards spelt out by the Ministry. In other words, volunteers' sweat equity will be matched by the Government's financial equity. Indeed, Government has already recognised this need in extending a $3/$4 for one matching grant for funds raised by the CDCs. It is a small step to extend it from here to other community organisations. Such an approach, I believe, will certainly ensure that our volunteers channel their energies into their value-adding component of their activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, a word on estate duty. It has been said that the only two things that are certain in life are death and taxes. Estate duty has the dubious distinction of merging these two seemingly immutable facts of life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the revisions in recent times, I have been asked by several Singaporeans why the need to continue with this fiscal device. There seems to be good reasons behind their question. Estate duty raised about $69 million in the last financial year and is projected to raise $70 million in FY 97/98. These amounts, whilst not insignificant, are dwarfed by other sources of revenue. Estate duty accounts for less than one half of one percent of total revenue. Its value as a revenue-raising or income-redistributing fiscal device is therefore limited. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the duty does distort inter-generational transfers of wealth by creating perverse incentives for high net worth individuals to undertake estate planning. Singapore is also one of a few countries that continue the practice. Neighbouring countries do not have estate duties, eg, Australia, Malaysia, etc. This disparity may take the shine off our attractiveness as a location for wealth and distort the flow of capital into Singapore. If one takes costs of these distortions and the costs of collection and compliance into account, one can reasonably question the economic efficiency of the estate duty and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> its place in Singapore's fiscal policy. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister could give us an elaboration. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget Statement did not generate too much excitement probably because it did not match last year's very generous delivery. But against the backdrop of an economic downturn, I would certainly view this year's Budget Statement as positively optimistic. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP commented that the Government is handing out crumbs. Either he has not taken time to go through the whole Budget in detail or he is trying to mislead our Singaporeans. Because apart from the income tax and S&amp;C and rental rebates, which have been highlighted by the Minister, the ongoing schemes such as Edusave bursaries and scholarships, IUP and MUP to HDB estates, Medisave top-up scheme and share ownership scheme will cost the Government billions of dollars. And these schemes benefit mostly the majority of our citizens, and not the so-called privileged group. To say that these are crumbs is simply absurd. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must congratulate our Minister for Finance for delivering a very positive tax reform for the financial sector. It is farsighted and, in time, would definitely yield good results. The business community is particularly disappointed because the expected cut in corporate tax did not come about. But the challenges faced by the manufacturers, investors or entrepreneurs are much more daunting and a mere reduction in corporate tax by even one or two per cent cannot be effective in improving our competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is being classified as a developed nation and has performed well in economic growth in the past years, more and more of our neighbouring countries are emulating our success formula. China was first to open her doors for foreign investments. Other countries in South East Asia and in the Indian \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sub-continent have followed suit. Like Singapore, they have become very aggressive in attracting foreign investments, offering very attractive packages. The advantages Singapore gained have slowly been diminishing and as we become more developed, the cost of doing business is also becoming much higher. In all probability, double digit growth may be a thing of the past. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs of labour, rental and other utilities have shot up tremendously, and our competitors are fully exploiting their competitive edge in terms of abundant labour and natural resources. It is fortunate that we have built up such good economic fundamentals. We must always emphasise the importance of training and quality control by constantly upgrading the skills and productivity of our labour force. These measures have generally been successful. This allows us to retain our competitive edge over the others up to now. In addition to that, it is our sheer will to compete and to succeed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the gap of our competitive edge can be expected to be narrowed as time goes on, and we have to find new innovative ways to stay ahead of our competitors, otherwise we will be left behind. Already our star performers in information technology, telecommunications, airport, port and petrochemical have been under great pressure from our competitors, especially from China and Malaysia. The Committee set up to look into business competitiveness is an appropriate measure our Government has undertaken to help the manufacturing and business sectors. I am confident that their findings and recommendations will go a long way to help them to become more competitive. I hope the Government will respond positively to their recommendations and take appropriate measures to help the business community to increase their competitiveness against our neighbouring countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's effort in building up our second wing economy in order to sustain our continuous economic growth is slowly showing positive results. The rationale of having this second wing economy is well recognised. The Government has taken the lead in opening \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> markets in and around the region by making the necessary contacts to pave the way for Singaporean investors, manufacturers and entrepreneurs to venture into these areas. Projects such as the Suzhou and Bangalore Industrial Parks as well as numerous medium and small ones in other parts of China and Vietnam are some such examples. Many of these ventures are spearheaded by the Government-linked companies. The advantages of Government-linked companies are obvious with their strong financial backing and abundance of human resources and networking. The Government also encourages the private entrepreneurs to move into these places and explore all investment possibilities. It is important that the Government-linked companies and the private sector should work as one unit in order to maximise their combined efforts. Each sector must recognise its inherent strengths and weaknesses. While the Government provides the opening and the official connections, the Government-linked companies and the private sector can then concentrate on the implementation. But we must recognise the special characteristics in dealing with countries like China, Southeast Asia or the Indian sub-continent. One such example is that contact and working between official channels will invariably encounter a lot of red tape and bureaucracy and sometimes take a great deal of time as well as energy to come to a final agreement. Very often, a highly feasible project would become a non-starter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector has the advantage of being more flexible and able to fully exploit the personal relationship - quanxi - to cut through this red tape and bureaucracy and therefore achieve better and faster results. The private sector will also be able to take more calculated risks. The worst that can happen is for our Government-linked companies and the private sector to harbour distrust for each other and view each other as competitors. The existence of such a negative mindset should be eradicated. I would therefore like to see better coordination and cooperation between the Government-linked \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> companies and the private sector, especially in overseas ventures. They should share resources, information, and cooperate, where possible, and project themselves as a single unit. It has to be acknowledged that if the private sector's venture is successful, it will bring as much benefit to Singapore as the successful Government-linked company's venture. Because all the resources and the gains will be brought back to Singapore to strengthen our national economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to always remember to turn our weakness into strengths. Our smallness can, therefore, be a plus factor as it lets us work as a more compact unit and move a lot quicker than others. But this also means we must be united. The Government-linked companies, the private sector and the Government should all work in unison. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate on the Budget proposed by the Minister for Finance. Given that this is an interim or half-time Budget, the Minister could have made it a bit more all rounded had he thought about and given concessions so that the issue of the cost of doing business in Singapore could have been addressed. Although we may hear of more comprehensive measures next year, many businesses really need help right now and for some it could have made the difference between surviving or succumbing to the pressures faced. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Summary of Budget</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Budget announced by the Minister last week provided good incentives for the financial sector, though it will benefit just a few existing businesses in Singapore. The added incentives for the logistics operations and the siting of satellite operations here also indicate the direction being set by the Government. For all these sectors, I can understand why the impact of the incentives will be felt only by a few big players in their respective fields, and I support the thinking behind it because it is very key that we are able to attract a few of the big \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> names who are the leaders in their fields to locate into Singapore. These big players will form a vital base in Singapore that will stimulate supporting industries. They will bring in the expertise and technology that we lack and we can learn from them. With the support of a group of big international players based in Singapore, we can become an important regional centre for the selected sectors. I believe that the incentives also reflect the growing importance of these sectors as the future components of the overall Singapore economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Minister for Finance has overlooked two very important areas in our economy. These are the manufacturing sector and the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Given that manufacturing contributes to about 25% of the total GDP, I would have thought that the Minister could have provided some help, especially during this period where the manufacturing sector is going through a rough period. On the other hand, the SMEs form a very important part of our economy, employing a relatively large percentage of our workforce and contribute a significant amount to our GDP. They too have been neglected in this Budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Manufacturing sector</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the manufacturing sector has been experiencing sluggish growth and even decline in certain quarters for the last six quarters. Although the electronics and semiconductor industries have been through some cyclical low periods, one of the key issues facing Singapore is its competitiveness as a manufacturing base. This is especially critical since foreign investors now have wide ranging choices as the capabilities and attractiveness of other Asian countries improve. There is a particular threat from our close neighbours who now have the people and infrastructure to manufacture as well as us, at attractive costs, quality and cycle times. I was therefore anticipating some help from the Government to address such competitiveness issues in the two areas of concerns for the manufacturing sector, namely, cost of land and labour. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Land cost \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister rightly pointed out, the costs of land in Singapore, be it residential, commercial or industrial properties, have risen artificially high in such a short span of the past five years. The Government has failed to control asset price inflation, unlike its good job in controlling consumer price inflation in Singapore. The sudden and steep increases in industrial and commercial property prices have caught many businesses too suddenly and they have not been able to restructure or adjust their businesses to become profitable again fast enough. Multinationals may be encouraged to accelerate their relocation to lower cost countries, if the cost of land overshadows other attractive features of the Singapore economy, like the highly skilled and productive workers, good infrastructure support and incentives for companies to invest here. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Areas for Government to focus on</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given all the problems related to the asset price inflation, I was therefore expecting the Minister for Finance to announce measures that will control any future steep increases in property prices. Although the measures introduced in May 1996 were useful to reduce widespread speculation in the property market, I feel that more needs to be done so that we do not go the way that Japan went some years ago. Singapore being small cannot afford to see the bubble bursting all of a sudden. We therefore need many more measures to curb any future steep increases in property prices. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Improve efficiency of land use</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the suggestions that I have are, first of all, to improve the efficiency of land use. One of the areas, especially in the industrial land use, is that we need to actively look for opportunities where industrial land can be more efficiently used so that the overall cost can be brought down. We need to allow some flexibility as to how the land needs to be developed and consider better plot ratios. Also, there is a possibility of allowing multiple uses for a single piece of land. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Control of foreign ownership</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have some controls in this area, I believe more can be done and one area we need to seriously look at is further restricting foreigners from purchasing private properties in Singapore. If we look around the world, there are many countries with good measures, even countries like Malaysia and Australia, which have abundant land, have more stringent control on foreign ownership of land and property in their countries than we have here. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Allow attractive subsidies for new businesses</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring in investment dollars, the Government needs to consider allowing a wider range of businesses which can enjoy the subsidies of land and building rentals. This should be especially encouraged for companies pumping in large amounts of capital dollars in Singapore. I understand we have such a system for a selected group of industries like wafer fabs, but I feel we need to allow more businesses to qualify. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Labour availability and cost</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <i>Availability of Workers</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which really impacts the efficiency of the manufacturing sector is the availability of the right type of workers with the appropriate skills. We need both skilled as well as semi-skilled workers. Because the manufacturing sector cannot attract enough Singaporeans, there is a need to further open up new sources of workers, especially from the ASEAN countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <i>Productivity and training of workers</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to remain attractive, we need to ensure the productivity of our workers continues to improve so that we can justify the wage increases. To achieve this, companies need to invest a lot more than what they have been investing in the training of our workers, especially the older workers. However, if they do this, it adds to the total labour cost. I therefore hope the Government will be able to do a lot more in providing attractive incentives \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that will encourage employers to invest in training and productivity improvement programmes for their workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <i>Strength of the Singapore dollar</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if our wage increases have been in line with productivity improvements, if the Singapore dollar continues to strengthen against foreign currencies, then in their home currency terms, for the multinationals operating in Singapore, the wage cost and other related social cost of doing businesses in Singapore go up at a much higher rate than real productivity improvements. We therefore cannot just look at wage increases in Singapore dollar terms, but also in foreign currency terms. We may not be able to sustain competitiveness in the long term if our dollar continues to strengthen too fast, as it happened in the past few years. The recent \"devaluation\" of the other ASEAN currencies will create added pressures for us. I hope the Minister for Finance will consider proactive measures that will moderate any steep changes in the exchange rates in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Regionalisation and Small and Medium Enterprises</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to continue to encourage regionalisation among our local companies. However, we must be realistic that many of our local SMEs are not in a position to do it on their own and to take full advantage of Singapore's regionalisation effort nor fully tap the incentives given by the Government. Although there are a number of incentives targeted for the SMEs, they have not been able to take full advantage for various reasons, including a lack of understanding of what is available and how to apply. I therefore feel that we may have to set up a body or organisation specialising in helping the SMEs, just like the various specialised departments in the Economic Development Board that help multinationals do business in Singapore. The SMEs need special help to restructure their businesses until they can ensure long term competitiveness for themselves. We must remember that in order to regionalise, we still need a home base capable of developing the skills and technology to fan out \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to the other sites in the region that we manage. We therefore cannot neglect the competitiveness of our operations and companies in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Summary of competitiveness</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that we may face a different situation from the one we faced in the mid-1980s where Singapore was in a recession during the bottom of the electronics and the semiconductor cycle. At that time the world was also in a similar situation, especially the USA, while this time round it is not. At that time, our neighbours were not on par with us and they had not sufficiently developed their infrastructure to become alternate investment choices for foreign investors for certain types of high technology and high value-added investments. Now, our neighbours have caught up and are providing strong competition and they can take on the same investments that we are targeting. I therefore feel that we may take a much longer time to get out of a down cycle from now on, should we go into a slump in the manufacturing sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the Government will, to a larger extent, allow market forces to rule the business environment and release more control that they have had up to now. Of course, this cannot happen overnight as we have been used to our current system for a long time. There are many examples where we could have done better had we allowed market forces to decide on issues with less Government control. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One question that many businessmen and industrialists have is whether we can live with a slightly lower surplus. Do we really know what is the optimal level of surplus that is healthy for our economy in the future, especially as we approach developed status? Can we actually release some of our funds so that our local businesses and companies can use these funds to restructure their businesses to ensure that they will survive in the face of tough competition ahead? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the Budget reflects the long term plans of the Government. It \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> also reflects the PAP Government's commitment to continue to share the success of the country with Singaporeans. This is reflected by the huge sums of money set aside in this budget for the HDB upgrading programme, the Medisave Top-up Scheme, increased funds for Medifund and Edusave. Above all, the Government has not forgotten those who will be impacted by the utility rates and other increases, by giving them utility, S&amp;C and rental rebates. Hence, I conclude that, just for a few areas, the Budget announced is almost an all rounded one. It is a pity we fall short of making it one that is all rounded. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion in the name of the Minister for Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, once there was a man, he was seen searching for something under a lamp post. After a while, he could not find what he was looking for. Another person came along and asked him, \"What are you looking for?\" He said, \"I have lost my key. I am looking for my key.\" And the person said, \"Where did you lose this key? Is it here?\" He said, \"No. Over there.\" The person then asked, \"Why don't you look for your key over there then? Why search over here?\" He said, \"Because it is too dark over here. It is brighter here than there. Easier to search.\" Obviously, he could not find his key. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the NCMP said that he saw nothing in the Budget to enhance the competitiveness of the Singapore economy, my conclusion is that maybe he was looking for the key at the wrong place. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My view on competitiveness is very simple. If we look at competitiveness as a function of cost alone, obviously to enhance our competitiveness is to lower the cost of everything in Singapore - make the land cheaper, make the office rental cheaper; better still, get the workers to take a pay cut. Then, in that way, cost of doing business in Singapore will decline overnight, businessmen will turn healthy profit overnight. But if we adopt that approach, then we are thinking of a win-lose situation. Win on one side on \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> profitability, lose on the other side for the workers. Obviously, that cannot be the case because at the end of the day, what is economic growth for? It is not to help businessmen make more profit but, at the end of the day, to make sure that every Singaporean can live a better life. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, my view of competitiveness is that competitiveness is a function of not just cost, but cost and capability. If we can upgrade our capability not just in the short term but over the long term, then over time workers can get higher salary, businessmen can still make more profit. That is what I meant by \"win-win\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may quote an example. Last month I was in Europe, in Switzerland. I visited a company known as ESEC. This company is in the business of producing back-end semi-conductor equipment and it is now one of the top three in the world. Its business is growing very fast, at 50%, 70%, every year, even during the slowdown of the global economic sector. We asked them, \"How big is your market in Switzerland?\" They said, \"0\". Everything the company produces is exported to the rest of the world, including Asia, Europe, USA, but nothing in Switzerland. How then can this company survive with no domestic market, with a high cost of doing business in Switzerland, and yet able to be profitable, able to grow? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is very simple. They strengthen their comparative advantages. So, over the years, they have developed their capabilities in the areas of R&amp;D, innovation, marketing and final assembly and testing. Eighty per cent of the manufacturing is out-sourced from the suppliers from lower cost locations. In this company, all the managers, the marketeers, the technicians, the skilled production workers, everyone is well paid. And yet at the same time, the company is profitable, and the business is growing. I think here is an example of the kind of \"win-win\", the kind of competitiveness we should be talking about. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, Sir, I would like to convey this message to the Minister for Finance that, in my view, Budget 1997 is a good budget. I said Budget 1997 is a good \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> budget because I feel that it actually addressed the competitiveness of Singapore in a hard-headed way, and not taking a soft approach. All the new policies that were introduced for the financial sector, as well as the enhanced resource allocation of budget for the industrial and business sectors, like in the areas of R&amp;D innovation, cluster development and upgrading of the local enterprises and so on, will go a long way to make sure that Singapore will continue to strengthen her position as a global hub in the Asia-Pacific in the 21st century. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that sense, Budget 1997 has been a pro-economic growth budget. At the same time, Budget 1997 is also a pro-worker budget. Because of the slower economic growth this year, workers are asked to accept moderated wage increase. Many of them are concerned that they have to live with a lower pay increase but higher transportation cost and higher water tariffs. They were all looking for some reliefs from Budget 1997, and they were not disappointed. I have consulted many of my grassroots leaders in my constituency as well as the unionists in the NTUC. Many of them have responded very positively. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, all in all, I would like to commend the Minister for giving Singaporeans such a pro-economic growth Budget as well as a pro-worker Budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me now to go on to offer some suggestions on how I feel future budgets can address some of the issues that will further position ourselves for future competition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the budget in the future should, firstly, address the pricing policy over the long term to make sure that the limited economic resources in Singapore can be put to better use, in particular in the areas of land and water. In the case of water, I feel that the recycling of water in the industry today is still very limited. Obviously, from the industry's point of view, it does not make sense for them to put in place all these expensive recycling equipment to save water, given the relatively lower price of water. Obviously, increasing the water charges is not the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> solution, because they are already paying more, and to charge them more means that it will reduce our cost competitiveness. But I think one approach is to encourage the industry to do more in the area of water recycling, bearing in mind that the opportunity cost of not recycling water has gone up by eight times with the high cost of desalination. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is in the area of industrial land. Industrial land in Singapore is limited. It is expensive and yet at the same time, if we drive around Singapore, we see many factories in Singapore are still low-rise, only one-storey or two-storeys. Why is that so? Obviously, developers will give you many reasons. Firstly, some factories cannot go higher up because it is very process intensive. But in some cases, they will claim that it is because of logistics consideration, very cumbersome operations, and so on. But the bottomline is this. The way we charge differential premium and development charges today has to a certain extent also discouraged the intensification of industrial land. I hope that in future pricing policy, we can bear this in mind. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area where I think we really have to pay more attention is with regard to the upgrading of the capabilities of the Singapore workforce. We have to make sure that we will continue to have one of the best workforce in the world in order to bring us forward into the future. Here, I recall what Deputy Prime Minister BG Lee mentioned, that Singapore has the potential to grow at 7% a year over the medium term. But to realise this 7% growth potential, we have to expand our workforce by 3% and achieve 4% growth in productivity. So three plus four gives us 7% potential. Therefore, I feel that our Budget should really concentrate on these two targets of how we can expand our workforce by 3% and our productivity by 4%, so that we can fully realise our potential. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in the area of expanding the workforce. Obviously we can expand the workforce by at least three ways. First is to encourage more Singaporeans to have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> more children; second is to bring in more foreign workers; third is to bring more Singaporeans who have left the workforce back to the workforce. On the first approach, in fact we are already encouraging Singaporeans to have more babies. If you look at the population growth, it has gone up from 1.3% in 1980 to 1.7% in 1990, to 1.9% last year, and most probably stabilises at 2% a year. That is probably as far as we can go. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second approach of bringing in more foreign workers, again, we are already doing so. According to the Department of Statistics, there are today 568,000 foreigners living in Singapore. Of course, not all of them are foreign workers. This number includes the foreign students and dependants and so on. But the point I would like to highlight is that one in six persons in our society today and one in five workers in our economy today is already a foreigner. So, while we should continue to bring in more foreign talents and foreign workers to supplement and complement the shortage of workers in Singapore, I think we must recognise that there is a limit to which we can do this because of the social, political and economic implications, if we are overly dependent on the foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a more desirable and sustainable approach is really to expand our workforce by bringing back Singaporeans, Permanent Residents (PRs) who, for whatever reasons, have left the workforce. According to the Department of Statistics, the labour force participation rate in Singapore today is 64.6%. Given our small population, this is actually a very low rate, compared to, say, 67% in USA. One of the reasons why the labour force participation rate in Singapore is low is because among the female Singaporeans and PRs, only 51.5% participated in the workforce. For women aged between 40 and 49, our participation rate is only 52% compared to 71% in Japan, 76% in USA, 79% in UK. And for those aged 50 and above, our participation rate is only 41%. So one of the reasons could be that many of the Singaporean women left the workforce to look after their children when they are young, but did not re-enter the workforce. I feel that if we can \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> find ways to bring them back, we can increase the workforce by maybe 30,000 to 50,000 if we can increase the workforce participation rate comparable to that of other developed economies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, the group of older Singaporeans who are in their 50s and 60s can also be an additional source of workforce. Again the number is quite big and I will not go into it. But the bottomline is that if we increase the participation rate by 10% to 15%, again, we can increase the workforce by 15,000 to 25,000. Altogether, these two sources of supply can contribute 50,000-75,000 more workers in the near term. In fact, over the long term, the number is likely to grow even bigger because of the aging population in Singapore. The Ministry of Labour, the PSD, the SNEF and the NTUC have already started doing this. They are trying to bring the housewives and the retirees back to the workforce. So far, the response has been positive. More than 4,000 workers have already signed up. But the success rate in terms of matching them to jobs is still fairly low, at about 20%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point therefore is that maybe the Government should consider giving this programme a stronger push through some incentives. For example, the Government can help to defray the cost of job design, or to introduce some new measures, for example, for companies which want to employ more foreign workers, one of the conditions attached is for them to employ some of these housewives and retirees, so that on the one hand, while we continue to bring in foreign workers to supplement the shortage of workers in Singapore, at the same time, we make sure that we maximise the participation of Singaporeans and PRs in our workforce. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is even more important. This is regarding the employability of our mature and lower educated workers. Mr Speaker, Sir, last month I visited three countries in Europe together with my fellow unionists. We went to Europe to study the unemployment situation in Switzerland, France and Germany. 18 million workers are now jobless in Europe. In Switzerland, unemployment \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> today is 5.3%; in France, 12.6%; Germany, 11.1%. Some of these workers are out of job because the economy is going through a bad patch and as a result, workers are out of job. But this kind of unemployment, known as a cyclical unemployment, is nothing of great concern to these countries because in the near future, when the economy moves again, I think the workers are likely to be able to go back to the job market. But what is of greater concern to these countries is that the majority of the workers are out of job not because the economy is going through a bad patch but because there are structural weaknesses in the economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Switzerland, for example, 3% of the unemployment are structural unemployment. In the case of France, it is about 9.7%; in the case of Germany, it is about 8.8%, which means 70% or so of the unemployed in Europe today are due to structural unemployment. And the scary thing about structural unemployment is that it is due to a mis-match between cost and capability. So to solve structural unemployment, either cost must come down or capability must move up, or preferably both. But in reality, cost cannot come down overnight because of a rigid labour market and high social contribution. At the same time workers cannot acquire new skills overnight. As a result of this, European countries have accepted that they will have to live with structural unemployment at least in the near term. Therefore, unemployment in Europe is not likely to decline very rapidly in the near future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, judging from the experience of European countries today, we recognise that we must never take full employment in Singapore for granted. The point about the need to upgrade the skills of workers has been discussed by various Members here. Here, I would like to point out that in this world, there are many willing people. Some are willing to work, whereas some are willing to let other people do the work, whereas they only do all the talking. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the case of labour MPs present in this House, we are very \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> willing people. We see the problem of structural unemployment, of employability, and we take action to solve the problem. But earlier I heard Mr Chiam See Tong and Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam say that in Singapore, the Government is not concerned at all - of course he did not say that the labour movement was not concerned at all - about this problem of under-educated workers. This cannot be the case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to share some statistics to show that the labour movement and the Government have been working on this issue not in the last one year, or last three years, but, in fact, we have been working on this problem for the last 10-20 years. For example, in 1983, the Government introduced the BEST programme. In 1987, we introduced the WISE programme. And the union movement has worked together with the Government to make sure that the BEST and WISE programmes reach out to those workers who are under-educated. As of now, after 14 years of implementation, 212,000 workers in Singapore have gone through the BEST programme. Another 75,000 workers have participated in the WISE programme. So from these numbers, you can see that, in fact, the Government and the labour movement have been taking this issue of training of workers very seriously for the last 20 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, the Skills Development Fund (SDF) has been supporting and encouraging training in the economy. Last year, I was told that SDF had created one training place for every three workers which means that one out of three workers last year took part in training. On top of that, the total expenditure in training last year stood at about 3.6% of the payroll, one of the highest in the world. In fact, our long-term target is 4%. We are well on our way to achieving that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, even though I talk so passionately about this threat of structural unemployment and about the need to retrain our workers, my point is different from Mr Chiam's or the NCMP's. My point is not that we have been sleeping, the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Government has been sleeping or the labour movement has been sleeping for the last many years. My point is that we have been working so hard and we do not take any chances. Even though much has been done up till now, we should continue to do even more because if we are affected by structural unemployment, the implication can be very serious. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to offer one suggestion. The NTUC, in formulating our vision for the 21st century, known as the \"NTUC 21 - A Better Life\", has in fact indentified life-long employability as the most important pillar in enabling our workers in Singapore to live a better life in the future. In that regard, the NTUC, working with the Government, has introduced various programmes to make sure that workers are being retrained so that they can be kept up to date. One such programme is the Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) whereby at this moment, 3,000 workers from 27 companies have already signed up for this programme and they are now going back to school to gain skills certification. We have gone beyond training. We are talking about skills certification where workers can now receive skills which will make them employable in the next century. These are skills which should be transferable across companies and industries. And we hope that in future budgets, the Government can consider setting aside more resources to support programmes, such as the SRP. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by emphasising that the way forward for Singapore is very exciting. We have Singapore 21 to make Singapore our Best Home in the 21st century. It is very important that we make sure that every Singaporean, young and old, is given a chance, given the assistance and given all the facilitation to participate in the creation of wealth in the economy, to share success in the society and to move forward together as one united people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I would like to appeal to the Government to invest not only in the young but also the not-so-young Singaporeans so that the 21st century can lead to a better life for all workers in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we have made good progress with 15 MPs who have spoken this afternoon.
