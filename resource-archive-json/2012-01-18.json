class=\"ph b\">Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor\r\nLean Suan) (for the Minister for Health)</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, please allow\r\nme to first explain the difference between active tuberculosis (TB)\r\nand latent TB infection. Active TB is a disease state where the\r\npatient is symptomatic and the disease can spread to others. Latent\r\nTB infection is an asymptomatic disease state during which the disease\r\ncannot spread to others.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cf610769-2755-42f4-9a1b-005e825c17e3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-579ae903-67d7-41a9-919d-24650b7bfd66__id-cf610769-2755-42f4-9a1b-005e825c17e3\"><!--a--></a>The majority of people\r\nwith latent infection, about 90%, will not develop active TB disease.\r\nOnly about 10% of persons with latent TB infection develop active\r\nTB disease. This may take place many years after the infection,\r\nalthough there is a higher risk of active TB during the first two\r\nyears of infection. On average, about 1,380 Singapore residents\r\nwere diagnosed with active TB each year over the last five years,\r\nor about 40 cases per 100,000. Most, or about 95% of these cases,\r\nare adults. Among non-residents excluding short-term visitors, the\r\naverage number was also about 40 cases per 100,000 over the same\r\nperiod, or about 450 per year. Short-term visitors were excluded\r\nas many of them were workers who were diagnosed during pre-employment\r\nmedical screening for application of work passes, and will be rejected\r\nif they were found to have TB. Others were here specifically for\r\nTB treatment. There were about 100 students diagnosed with TB each\r\nyear during the last five years. More than 75% were students aged\r\n17 years or older. About 1,000 people are currently being treated\r\nfor TB.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-90db707f-ba82-4605-b8f0-aeae3d74d610\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-579ae903-67d7-41a9-919d-24650b7bfd66__id-90db707f-ba82-4605-b8f0-aeae3d74d610\"><!--a--></a>I would like to highlight\r\nthat Singapore has one of the lowest incidence rates of TB in Asia,\r\nbesides Japan. Singapore has a comprehensive national TB control\r\nprogramme which was enhanced in 1997 with the setting up of the\r\nSingapore Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (STEP). Under STEP,\r\nthe key control strategy for TB is, firstly, early detection and\r\neffective treatment. This is important to stop the spread of TB\r\nin the community. Secondly, the TB Control Unit, which runs STEP,\r\nclosely monitors compliance with treatment until cure. Whilst most\r\npatients would voluntarily be compliant with the treatment, the\r\nInfectious Diseases Act gives us the power to mandate treatment\r\nof TB patients who are non-compliant, if necessary. By actively\r\nmonitoring the treatment process of all TB cases, the risks of treatment\r\nfailure and development of multi-drug resistance are lowered</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1007</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6ba153fd-1f60-4c0d-a846-8899266177b9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-579ae903-67d7-41a9-919d-24650b7bfd66__id-6ba153fd-1f60-4c0d-a846-8899266177b9\"><!--a--></a>Finally, as TB could only be transmitted\r\nthrough prolonged close contact, contact-screening is conducted\r\namong household contacts and other close contacts in institutions\r\nlike schools to identify persons with latent TB infection. Persons\r\nwith latent TB infection are offered preventive treatment to reduce\r\nthe likelihood of developing active disease. My Ministry will continue\r\nto monitor the effectiveness of the TB control programme closely,\r\nand implement enhancements from time to time.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-1091f519-67a0-4657-be81-98d72303f6e0\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-579ae903-67d7-41a9-919d-24650b7bfd66__id-1091f519-67a0-4657-be81-98d72303f6e0\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4e2f7c2f-4c46-4b8e-890a-7e1d7e5ce2ec\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-579ae903-67d7-41a9-919d-24650b7bfd66__id-4e2f7c2f-4c46-4b8e-890a-7e1d7e5ce2ec\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nSir, I thank the Minister of State for answering my question.

If the X-rays show black spots, it would\r\nbe easy to presume it might be TB.

As I have said earlier in my reply,\r\nactive TB cases are symptomatic cases. This is a disease state where the\r\ndisease can be spread to others in the community. We do not screen\r\nfor latent TB cases. If they are found to have active TB, they will\r\nbe rejected and sent home. When a foreign domestic worker re-applies for\r\na Work Permit, she would be screened again. The screening is done\r\nevery time they apply for a Work Permit. The reason being that we\r\nfeel that active TB can present itself in between screenings. The\r\nbest way to prevent the spread of such a disease would be to get\r\nforeign domestic workers to go to the doctor, especially if they\r\nhave a chronic cough, because that is the main symptom of TB.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-6569ed6c-9a81-4c0a-abb1-e9e73a8140cf\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-579ae903-67d7-41a9-919d-24650b7bfd66__id-6569ed6c-9a81-4c0a-abb1-e9e73a8140cf\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2d0b8d0d-a278-4251-be16-79d19e989229\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-579ae903-67d7-41a9-919d-24650b7bfd66__id-2d0b8d0d-a278-4251-be16-79d19e989229\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mrs Lina Chiam</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, I would\r\nlike to ask the Minister of State whether it means that when a foreign worker\r\napplies for a work pass and has undergone a screening test or an\r\nX-ray, there is no way to identify whether they have active TB or\r\nnot, is it, if there are no spots on the X-ray?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-96c1fa74-3d9a-483b-93d4-1496b5ceee22\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-579ae903-67d7-41a9-919d-24650b7bfd66__id-96c1fa74-3d9a-483b-93d4-1496b5ceee22\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3b34ca07-dd1f-4d31-ba6e-e8cc830f02c2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-579ae903-67d7-41a9-919d-24650b7bfd66__id-3b34ca07-dd1f-4d31-ba6e-e8cc830f02c2\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>\r\n                  </span>: We\r\nscreen them for active TB, and if they are confirmed to have active TB,\r\nthey will not be given the Work Permit, and they will be sent home.\r\nI have also said in my reply that we do not screen latent TB because\r\nthe risk of these cases developing into active TB is actually very low.\r\nOnly about one in 10 of such cases will develop into an active TB\r\ncase, and it could develop over the course of many years.

Even though they want the kids to be in the Gifted Programme,\r\nthey also see the concern as something which they need to manage.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-c2c1fd9c-b0e5-45b4-8c9d-c5cd7c3441b2\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-74142121-b690-4ad3-b00a-4ad105ca56f2__id-c2c1fd9c-b0e5-45b4-8c9d-c5cd7c3441b2\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-64695fd4-1433-4348-a246-55edad07d637\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-74142121-b690-4ad3-b00a-4ad105ca56f2__id-64695fd4-1433-4348-a246-55edad07d637\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, this\r\ngoes back to what we can do through our schools and through our teachers.\r\nYes, there are different pathways and there are some which are catered\r\nto students who are academically very strong.

Certainly, we want to do that, and the majority\r\nof our schools are like that. I think we have a few specialised\r\nschools catering to a select group of students where we think that,\r\nfrom an educational point of view, they may be better served because\r\nit is a more homogeneous group and their needs are very different,\r\nand so more special attention, a customised curriculum can be developed\r\nto reach out to this group. It is a balance. We cannot take that approach\r\nand take it to an extreme.

Academically,\r\nthey are coping better in this new environment. As we monitor, we\r\nwill feel our way forward, in terms of evolving new models. But,\r\ncertainly, I agree with the Member that we will be very open to\r\nlooking at different models, new ways of promoting better integration.\r\nWe have a school system the way it is with the mainstream schools\r\nacross the board, but a few very specialised institutions catering\r\nto specific needs.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1013</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-01c42f51-fc94-45b8-9e2b-8510f410066a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-74142121-b690-4ad3-b00a-4ad105ca56f2__id-01c42f51-fc94-45b8-9e2b-8510f410066a\"><!--a--></a>I accept the point and I agree with the\r\nMember that we should as far as possible avoid that sense of separation\r\nat an early age when our children are growing up, and for these\r\nschools to come up with more programmes.

At the teacher level, we\r\nmaintain a balance of the quality of MOE teachers allocated across\r\nall schools, and we would continue to do that. We continue to expand our\r\nteaching force so that schools can afford to have more targeted\r\nprogrammes catering to the different needs of all students.

Is there going to be\r\na trend that there is going to be more of these specialised Normal (Technical)\r\nschools spread across Singapore? And whether MOE will instead consider\r\nperhaps clustering resources together so that, perhaps, within the\r\ncluster, they can help to set examination papers across the Normal\r\n(Technical) classes in the schools? Or maybe MOE can do that, so\r\nthat we can still let these Normal (Technical) students stay in\r\na normal school rather than separate them?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-ee089fb5-a3b1-45bb-ac05-f40ca65755c4\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-74142121-b690-4ad3-b00a-4ad105ca56f2__id-ee089fb5-a3b1-45bb-ac05-f40ca65755c4\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c01e58d4-0e03-41d6-a6a6-c3a2cfb75814\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-74142121-b690-4ad3-b00a-4ad105ca56f2__id-c01e58d4-0e03-41d6-a6a6-c3a2cfb75814\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I thank\r\nthe Member for the supplementary question. In fact, the second part of\r\nwhat he said is already happening. Within the clusters in the zone,\r\nthe teachers who are involved in teaching Normal (Technical) do\r\nshare notes, do come together and share experiences and resources.\r\nBut the specialised schools are really a step forward in terms of\r\nthinking about perhaps a different way of doing things. So it is, to some extent,\r\nan experiment in terms of trying out something different where we have\r\na specialised institution catered to this group of people, appropriately\r\nresourced, with a different curriculum catered to them.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1014</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-35d5ffad-fd3c-462a-bcac-c5e2ecdc1d83\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-74142121-b690-4ad3-b00a-4ad105ca56f2__id-35d5ffad-fd3c-462a-bcac-c5e2ecdc1d83\"><!--a--></a>There will be pros and\r\ncons, and we have to strike a balance. There is no plan for us now\r\nto expand these specialised schools because this is something new.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are developing these programmes and we\r\nare looking very hard and monitoring the results of what is happening\r\nthrough these schools. The initial findings are positive. We think\r\nthese children are coming out better and they are coping better\r\nin their studies, and they are learning better, more effectively.\r\nThat does not mean that we should proliferate and expand them. I\r\ndo not think there are any plans now. But what we would want to do,\r\nas I mentioned, is to focus on these institutions to see how they\r\ncan do better, in terms of developing their children in these schools.\r\nAt the same time, we will take up Ms Denise Phua's suggestion of programmes\r\nthat can better integrate students across different institutions.\r\nWe are working on multiple approaches.

If we think there are indications\r\nthat a particular programme offers success and is useful, then we\r\nwould look at ways to expand it in the most effective manner.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 1014</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Total Stamp Duty Collection<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-269a424e-a43c-47d5-a1d9-77db561af839\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-269a424e-a43c-47d5-a1d9-77db561af839\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-68740073-86d9-44f9-9711-9a5725d1ed1f\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-a1a8c838-781b-4176-8c5a-cbe45a626e6b__id-68740073-86d9-44f9-9711-9a5725d1ed1f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a5bf2f6f-5610-4325-83cf-d7488ffe5578\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-a1a8c838-781b-4176-8c5a-cbe45a626e6b__id-a5bf2f6f-5610-4325-83cf-d7488ffe5578\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">5</span>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mrs Lina Chiam</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance for the last\r\nfive years, what is the total amount of stamp fees collected by\r\nthe Government in respect of property transactions. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-b6b10b2e-d49c-4f2a-aef2-e70246caa8ef\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-a1a8c838-781b-4176-8c5a-cbe45a626e6b__id-b6b10b2e-d49c-4f2a-aef2-e70246caa8ef\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-049439c8-9b6a-4961-abf1-3636c89a127e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-a1a8c838-781b-4176-8c5a-cbe45a626e6b__id-049439c8-9b6a-4961-abf1-3636c89a127e\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs\r\nJosephine Teo) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, over the five financial years from FY 2006/2007\r\nto FY 2010/2011, the total amount of stamp duty collected in respect\r\nof transactions on sales and purchases of properties was $10.87\r\nbillion. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 1014</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">HDB Studio Apartments<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-3fa7aaa2-f3ab-43f6-963b-fb457938a259\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-3fa7aaa2-f3ab-43f6-963b-fb457938a259\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <h2 class=\"shortdesc hcSubTitle\">(Sale of apartments to\r\nsingles aged below 55 years)</h2>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-bc4e6fb3-cbfa-418a-8a89-d3aa6e9d0b6b\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-8e8b5fe5-9b5d-4efc-bf92-ca18a95cac57__id-bc4e6fb3-cbfa-418a-8a89-d3aa6e9d0b6b\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-125b2e1e-89f7-47a2-a251-60bb1d3b2ddb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-8e8b5fe5-9b5d-4efc-bf92-ca18a95cac57__id-125b2e1e-89f7-47a2-a251-60bb1d3b2ddb\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">6</span><span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Minister for National Development whether the Ministry would\r\nconsider allowing the sale of HDB studio apartments to singles below\r\nthe age of 55 years old.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-2fbad9eb-760c-48c4-b51e-d1134d823068\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-8e8b5fe5-9b5d-4efc-bf92-ca18a95cac57__id-2fbad9eb-760c-48c4-b51e-d1134d823068\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-716efe9f-a483-413d-9809-cf1beb1696d8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-8e8b5fe5-9b5d-4efc-bf92-ca18a95cac57__id-716efe9f-a483-413d-9809-cf1beb1696d8\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Minister for National Development (Mr\r\nKhaw Boon Wan)</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, the HDB Studio Apartments are\r\npurpose-built with senior-friendly features.

For young singles, I am not quite sure whether that\r\nis appropriate. Of course, as I have explained in this House two\r\nsittings ago, there is a wide range of potential house buyers. Housing\r\nis a very complex problem. I have to approach this problem systematically. I\r\nhave to set priorities. In due course, I would be able to address\r\nall the various segments. But I decided to zero in for the first\r\n12 months of my term on the first timers. I think we are delivering some\r\nresults, which now allow me, as I blogged about last night, to for\r\nthe next 12 to 24 months focus on the second timers.

So, he is all\r\nalone and he decided to just sell the 5-room flat, apply for a Studio\r\nApartment, and he will have some cash which he can then keep for his\r\nretirement. So, that certainly is a good option. It is not the only\r\noption for seniors but MND offered this option which I think can\r\nbe quite attractive for some of these seniors. We intend to expand\r\nit. I have been looking at the application rates for the Studio\r\nApartments \u2013 quite good, quite healthy, not overly subscribed, but\r\nwell taken up, practically 100%.

For Upper Boon Keng Road, the gantry operates for about\r\nhalf an hour in the morning from 8.30 am to 9.00 am. That is the\r\nonly time that it operates. The Nicoll Highway gantry operates from\r\n7.30 am to 8.00 pm, rests two hours, and from 10.00 am to 12 noon.\r\nThe durations of operation are different, and the rates are different.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-6cff5120-64db-4b1d-abec-3af8396f84ca\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-90865dda-2e47-4066-b9da-241f7f5c7fff__id-6cff5120-64db-4b1d-abec-3af8396f84ca\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0297bcec-2ef7-40af-b843-b6b81c820c23\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-90865dda-2e47-4066-b9da-241f7f5c7fff__id-0297bcec-2ef7-40af-b843-b6b81c820c23\"><!--a--></a>The reason why we need\r\nsome of these gantries, for example, like at Upper Boon Keng Road,\r\nis that they are part of an outer cordon through which vehicles\r\nhave to pass in order to get to the city, and we also need to control\r\nthe movement of vehicles in this direction. We have to make sure\r\nthat we have a cordon that is sufficiently effective. We look at\r\nthe speeds every quarter. When the speeds are above the optimal\r\nrange, we have the option then to reduce the rates or to do away\r\nwith it altogether, as we have done for CTE in the morning for certain\r\nhours. We have also done it for the CTE northbound, at night. The\r\nlast time we looked at the Upper Boon Keng gantry, the speeds were\r\nnot above the optimum range. They were within the optimum range\r\nand, hence, we continued to operate the gantry. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 1016</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Transport for Foreign Workers as a Compulsory Tender Requisite<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-c8f494b5-56eb-4f38-9d02-90dcecec4858\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-c8f494b5-56eb-4f38-9d02-90dcecec4858\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-70a70aab-6e60-4fad-8b24-df784b2a121d\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-663d587e-3881-4ce9-8b88-a6649a001543__id-70a70aab-6e60-4fad-8b24-df784b2a121d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-80c39d4b-47e1-4162-bc8b-154eaf428a04\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-663d587e-3881-4ce9-8b88-a6649a001543__id-80c39d4b-47e1-4162-bc8b-154eaf428a04\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">8</span><span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Alex Yam</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Minister for National Development if his Ministry would consider requiring\r\noperators of foreign worker dormitories to provide transport for\r\nworkers to their workplace on a compulsory basis before awarding\r\ntenders for the operation of these dormitories. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-090486ce-149f-4423-b64d-61af5d3cfa97\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-663d587e-3881-4ce9-8b88-a6649a001543__id-090486ce-149f-4423-b64d-61af5d3cfa97\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3ecf4aa1-6738-4ae8-a09b-55bbf0712483\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-663d587e-3881-4ce9-8b88-a6649a001543__id-3ecf4aa1-6738-4ae8-a09b-55bbf0712483\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Minister of State for National Development\r\n(BG [NS] Tan Chuan-Jin) (for the Minister for National Development)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, workers staying in foreign workers' dormitories\r\ncome from many different employers.

As reinforced by the Committee,\r\nwith figures such as these, no Minister would need to worry about\r\nhis ability to meet the financial needs of his family or have to\r\nface a drastic reduction in his standard of living. Many whom I\r\nspoke to were shocked that Ministers have hitherto received their pension.\r\nIf anything, public servants who have for the longest time deserved\r\nthe pension are our Division 3 and Division 4 civil servants, some\r\nof whom draw a salary of around the $1,500 mark.

The\r\nfirst question Mr Yee asked was whether I made my recommendations to\r\nthe Committee: the short answer is \"yes, I did\" but I did it in\r\nwriting because I did not think I was sufficiently special to ask\r\nfor an audience. The second, and this is the more fundamental question:\r\nwhat is the difference I think between the Workers' Party's proposal\r\nin terms of salary and ours because I think the Member asked me\r\nto check with the Prime Minister why he said it was higher and I\r\nsaid it was lower. The answer is actually quite simple. I think\r\nI should perhaps correct the error which I realised Mr Chen mentioned\r\nin his Facebook page yesterday as well. The Workers' Party's starting\r\nsalary for Ministers is $55,000. That is also the benchmark. On\r\nthe Committee's side, however, the benchmark is $55,000 but the\r\nstarting salary is lower. So, it is $47,250. That is one of the\r\nkey differences. Now, what is the result of that difference? The\r\nresult of that difference is that the Workers' Party's proposal\r\nresults in a higher base pay for the starting Minister but a lower\r\nmaximum bonus, whereas on the Committee's proposal, the starting\r\nsalary would be lower but the variable bonus is higher. So what\r\ndoes this mean in principle? This means that earlier ---</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-3e368db9-1d46-4afb-ad64-41fc98fd6862\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-3e368db9-1d46-4afb-ad64-41fc98fd6862\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-40a2a19c-ef49-428b-ab5e-4fb8e6fd90a9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-40a2a19c-ef49-428b-ab5e-4fb8e6fd90a9\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Speaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Nair, keep\r\nit short, please.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-d62233a5-1c1c-43b0-80fa-0cf553645624\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-d62233a5-1c1c-43b0-80fa-0cf553645624\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1021</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-dca4fc6c-4d0c-4ea9-9086-efbf17090275\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-dca4fc6c-4d0c-4ea9-9086-efbf17090275\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr\r\nVikram Nair</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Okay, sorry. The key difference in principle\r\nis that in a year when performance targets are not met, the Workers'\r\nParty's proposal will provide more pay. And in a year when performance\r\ntargets are met or exceeded, the Committee's proposal will provide\r\nmore pay. That is the key difference in terms of how they work.\r\nThe final question is how we should vote. I think one of the key\r\npoints I was making is obviously we should all vote according to\r\nour conscience but there is not much difference in principle. We\r\nall believe public service should be the most important thing. Now,\r\nthe Workers' Party has not said the salary should be reasonable,\r\nbut looking at your proposal, the salaries are in the same ballpark.\r\nSo, I think there is a lot of common ground. All I was hoping to\r\ndo is to highlight the common ground.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7cd7c33b-0fce-43d2-af0f-85f339f806ce\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-7cd7c33b-0fce-43d2-af0f-85f339f806ce\"><!--a--></a>Now, in terms of Mr Singh's\r\npoint that I highlighted that the Workers' Party's proposal was arbitrary,\r\nthat was not really as a criticism but more actually to highlight\r\nthe fact that whatever formula you come up with, there is some element\r\nof arbitrariness. But one point I should make is that the Workers'\r\nParty arrived at $55,000, apparently independently by coincidence\r\nat the same number as the Committee did. What is interesting is\r\nthat the probability of two four-digit numbers coinciding is miniscule,\r\nas anyone who has bought 4D would tell you. The probability of two\r\nfive-digit numbers coinciding, I would say, is probably miraculous.\r\nThis means there is probably some special agreement between us.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-8513eff0-333d-42a6-8ada-ff168a7adc07\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-8513eff0-333d-42a6-8ada-ff168a7adc07\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-19c1c866-7c02-422d-bf71-602944155060\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-19c1c866-7c02-422d-bf71-602944155060\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Speaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Pritam Singh,\r\ndo you want to respond?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-28f377c8-63f7-43de-8f34-0ecf5dfa56f9\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-28f377c8-63f7-43de-8f34-0ecf5dfa56f9\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0167029d-2f11-47a2-86a4-05bd83bbae32\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-0167029d-2f11-47a2-86a4-05bd83bbae32\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Pritam Singh</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Thank you,\r\nMr Speaker, I would like to thank ---</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-5cf8e051-496f-414c-a4bb-0511db28a8d4\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-5cf8e051-496f-414c-a4bb-0511db28a8d4\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-44b954d6-ee53-499c-bd0d-5a1d8a2f5289\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-44b954d6-ee53-499c-bd0d-5a1d8a2f5289\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Speaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Similarly, please\r\nkeep it short.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-03d8e128-dad0-404d-afa1-a674a8a71c62\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-03d8e128-dad0-404d-afa1-a674a8a71c62\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e93663c6-34cb-49d2-ab5b-eb40ffedb709\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-e93663c6-34cb-49d2-ab5b-eb40ffedb709\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Pritam Singh</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Yes.

Mr Vikram Nair seems very determined\r\nto prove that the Workers' Party's proposal is higher than that\r\nof the Committee. Now, we have always been, in our recommendation,\r\nfocusing on the main principles behind our proposal which I feel\r\nis important, the starting point from the MP pay. So, we have been\r\nusing benchmark pay versus the Committee's benchmark pay. Of course,\r\nwe understand that when we go into details, there will be some salary\r\nrange and, as the Committee proposed, it will be between 0.85 times\r\nand 1.1 times of the benchmark. Workers' Party has not gone into\r\nthe details of this because we feel it is not necessary at this\r\npoint. It is better to debate on the broad principles. I do not\r\nknow for whatever reasons he wants to continue to harp on these reasons\r\nthat ours is higher than the Committee's, but I do not feel this\r\nis necessary and actually diverts attention from the main point\r\nthat we are bringing up.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-bb65bca5-efce-4748-90cf-ff5f6ec3359a\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-bb65bca5-efce-4748-90cf-ff5f6ec3359a\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4cf3440e-b149-4e24-a8b9-de8a5f88ae83\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-4cf3440e-b149-4e24-a8b9-de8a5f88ae83\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Speaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Alvin Yeo.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-2b0e513a-c162-456f-b65b-c33044ca5c1f\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-2b0e513a-c162-456f-b65b-c33044ca5c1f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e68c1304-7428-4831-8419-7d1e77c59080\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-e68c1304-7428-4831-8419-7d1e77c59080\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nSir, I would like to seek clarification of comments made by Mr Pritam\r\nSingh and by Mr Gerald Giam earlier, where they criticised the level\r\nof bonus set by the Committee as being up to 13.5 months as somehow\r\nnot being consistent with a clean wage.

The idea here\r\nis not that it is not a clean wage, it is made quite transparent\r\nso the Committee has made it clear that with the good bonus, a Minister\r\nwould get $1.1 million. That is out in the open. The idea of having\r\na heavier weightage of bonus is to make it clear that the Minister\r\nwill not get that pay unless his performance is in keeping with\r\nKPIs which include national outcomes which improve the lot of Singaporeans.\r\nAnd my request for clarification is, does Mr Pritam Singh not accept\r\nthat that is consistent with the principle of having a Minister\r\nbeing made accountable for\r\nhis performance, not just with his own KPIs but with that of nationally\r\nset outcomes which better the lives of all Singaporeans?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-be3f2f39-52eb-44b6-a0b9-1acbcee821d4\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-be3f2f39-52eb-44b6-a0b9-1acbcee821d4\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1023</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-258e8c65-29a0-4ed1-a72d-bcb46b4c7c74\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-258e8c65-29a0-4ed1-a72d-bcb46b4c7c74\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Speaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Pritam Singh.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-632692fa-eb9b-4a44-88df-f93f093ffda4\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-632692fa-eb9b-4a44-88df-f93f093ffda4\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-94b20e03-0480-4b05-8663-936d6b263f05\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-94b20e03-0480-4b05-8663-936d6b263f05\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Pritam Singh</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Speaker,\r\nthank you very much.

We are not looking\r\nat the private sector, the CEOs in the private sector, how bonuses\r\nare paid out to them. We are looking at the rank-and-file civil\r\nservice. I believe that political salaries ought to have some comparison\r\nwith the rank-and-file civil service. Now, if the rank-and-file civil\r\nservice are not paid double-digit bonuses, then we feel in the same\r\nway that Ministers should not get double-digit bonuses.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b6b534ac-6397-4d1e-927f-a16bdec94a27\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-b6b534ac-6397-4d1e-927f-a16bdec94a27\"><!--a--></a>And I think the other\r\npoint that I tried to make in my speech was, if you pay these high\r\nbonuses, sure, it may be common or expected for CEO of GE or some\r\nother big MNC but what that works out in reality is an additional\r\npart of your wage which when you compare with other countries, you\r\nhave these additional perks, motorcycle allowances, bicycle allowances\r\nthat Mr Inderjit Singh spoke about. We feel that it comes to the\r\nsame thing, in some different roundabout way.

Well, as it turns out, the number that the Member\r\nhas proposed to pay a Minister, is actually not very different from\r\nthe number that the Committee chaired by Mr Gerard Ee is paying.\r\nWhat that means, in effect, is that the Member is also proposing\r\nto draw roughly from the same population that the Committee is proposing\r\nto draw from, to fill our political leadership. So, how is it then\r\nthat the Committee's proposal is elitist but then the Workers' Party's\r\nis not elitist?

And that is the principle we are getting\r\nat. And what we are suggesting is we do not need to peg it to people\r\nright up there.

Instead they kept some suggestions\r\nto be raised only in Parliament. Even if all WP's suggestions to\r\nthe Committee were not incorporated in the final report, they could\r\nstill have raised them in Parliament. So either they have not thought\r\nthrough this matter thoroughly, or they have changed their position,\r\nor perhaps there are other political motivations, I wonder. In fact,\r\nI am also a bit confused by the position taken now. I thought I understood\r\nWP's points that they are taking a different approach and, hence,\r\nthe principles about how the salaries should be benchmarked or calculated,\r\nalthough the quantums are the same. But I heard Mr Pritam Singh's\r\npoint just now that he made the reference towards Administrative\r\nService pay \u2013 not in principle but because the quantum was similar\r\nto what is proposed by the Review Committee \u2013 so I am getting confused. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c3a8350b-6d68-4f37-9be8-75e63620dfe7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-c3a8350b-6d68-4f37-9be8-75e63620dfe7\"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, there\r\nwill never be a right formula.

I think we all agree that the public duty should\r\nhave a discount, but is it a 40% or 80% discount? I think we all\r\nagree that it is arbitrary and very subjective.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9183fe01-88fd-4f3b-bfc4-9eb808bf6cc5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-9183fe01-88fd-4f3b-bfc4-9eb808bf6cc5\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I would like to make\r\ntwo suggestions. One, given that the benchmarks are based on the\r\n1,000th salaries, there will be a one to two-year lag before data\r\nare available from IRAS. Hence, the situation may happen when top\r\nSingaporean earners enjoy healthy income increments in a buoyant\r\neconomy, but when these salaries are used as the benchmark two years\r\nlater, Singapore has gone into a recession. It then becomes politically\r\nnot tenable to increase political salaries when people are being\r\nretrenched. We have seen it happened several times when increments\r\nbased on the previous formula were deferred or forgone. I suggest\r\nthat we fix the salary and have no adjustment for the full term\r\nof Parliament \u2013 that is, a fixed fee for a five-year contract.

May I seek a clarification from the Member\r\non whether he sees a difference between the private-sector pay of\r\nthe top 1,000, to which the Committee is proposing to peg Ministerial\r\nsalaries, and the private-sector pay to which the salaries of our\r\nrank-and-file civil servants outside of the Administrative Service\r\nare compared to in the process of the review of their salaries?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-714f5aab-2553-4521-a85c-aee73481eda4\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-714f5aab-2553-4521-a85c-aee73481eda4\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-91adcf0c-2340-417a-a246-d7890d204e57\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-91adcf0c-2340-417a-a246-d7890d204e57\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">BG [NS] Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I\r\nthank the hon Member for the question. There is a difference. What\r\nthe Committee proposes is using certain segment of the pay and then\r\nbringing it downwards. What you are proposing is to take a segment\r\nof the pay and bring it upwards. The point is that we all recognise\r\nthat the way we factor in salaries for the public sector has to\r\ntake into cognizance how the private sector pays, because we are\r\ndrawing from a pool of people who can move between private and public\r\nsectors. At the MX9 level, obviously at the Director level, it would\r\nbe drawing from a pool of people of a certain age at that level,\r\nand then you scale it up. In essence, what I am saying is that while\r\non the surface it sounds like it is different but, in reality, it\r\nis very similar. The numbers that are thrown up show that, actually, we\r\nare all in the same ballpark; rather, the Committee proposes a model\r\nbut then perhaps you choose to spin it in a different way.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-a07eaf41-8784-4a20-9d1f-68e8ff5d0818\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-a07eaf41-8784-4a20-9d1f-68e8ff5d0818\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-88261d20-b5c1-486a-ab2c-f4054840c1a8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-88261d20-b5c1-486a-ab2c-f4054840c1a8\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Yee Jenn Jong</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I have\r\ntwo clarifications to seek from the hon BG Tan.

Firstly, I do not doubt\r\nhis sincerity. Let me place that on record. What I cited was what\r\nthe Member said in Parliament yesterday. That, in essence, he had\r\nshared and he acknowledged that, and he described it now that he\r\nshared with the Committee some of the views and so on. The Member\r\nprovided a bit more details today, which I recognise. But he did\r\nsay something that was quite telling, which struck me, and which\r\nI found, on the one hand surprising, but also disturbing that, \"Well,\r\nwe need not necessarily tell them everything. They can wait for\r\nParliament because that is what Parliament is for.\"</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f76f44cb-f5f6-49be-ae84-0ee3cdfa2783\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-f76f44cb-f5f6-49be-ae84-0ee3cdfa2783\"><!--a--></a>And I agree with him that\r\nParliament is where we can carry out robust debates. But robust\r\ndebates on the Ministerial pay structure, as proposed by the Committee,\r\ncan still be debated fully and robustly even with providing the\r\nCommittee that effort, to actively take in all the considerations\r\nso that they can do as best a job as possible. That is what Parliament\r\nis for. But when committees and various efforts are put in place\r\nto help make things better, we do what we can to help them and to\r\nput it forward. So it was on that point that I found disturbing.\r\nBut I do not doubt the Member's sincerity in approach, nor do I doubt\r\nhis credentials and his commitment. But I thought the whole approach\r\nwas telling from the way the Member put it across.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-040598bf-ae86-4640-b0a6-e205bcced39d\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-040598bf-ae86-4640-b0a6-e205bcced39d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a133dc80-2097-4f97-aa52-9600e8c78352\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-a133dc80-2097-4f97-aa52-9600e8c78352\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Pritam Singh</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Speaker,\r\nSir, thank you very much. I thank the hon Member for his remarks. I\r\nwould just like to clarify because I think the impression is being\r\ncreated that just because not all the Workers' Party MPs participated\r\nin the Committee report or gave recommendations or suggestions that somehow\r\nwe came into Parliament to try and undermine the Committee's findings,\r\nrecommendations and so forth. I feel that impression is being created.\r\nIf the Member feels that the Workers' Party politicised the issue\r\n-- and I think the Member is doing the same -- what I do want to\r\nsay is that at no point do we feel that the Committee has been partisan,\r\nhas been unfair to us or that they are supporting the Government\r\nor they had that conclusion already and they wanted to proceed to\r\nprovide a report that the Government would have rubber-stamped,\r\nnot at all. And I want to make that clear to the Member.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-273d850f-6de4-4a0e-9a91-663b20e4714e\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-273d850f-6de4-4a0e-9a91-663b20e4714e\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-88046da0-6229-4777-873a-cd264df5f4ce\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-88046da0-6229-4777-873a-cd264df5f4ce\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">BG [NS] Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I\r\nam not sure why you feel so troubled. I apologise, no \"you\". I would like\r\nto thank the hon Member for his clarification. But I am puzzled\r\nwhy the hon Member feels disturbed because I did not make this allegation.\r\nIt was part of the earlier conversation. In my speech, I did not address\r\nthis point. But I think it is worthwhile to reflect on the whole\r\napproach. The issue at hand, now that I am here, is that if we are\r\nsincere about trying to change the Ministerial salary structure\r\nfor the better, something that would be acceptable for our people,\r\nthen it behooves all of us who have perspectives, passionate views,\r\nto help the Committee get to as best a solution as possible. This Committee\r\nis non-partisan. It is made up of people who are respectable, and\r\nit has drawn on many perspectives from the public. As we all know,\r\nthere are many different views. It is not easy, but they have done\r\nthe best job they can. The question is, and the honest point is,\r\nit does not stop the Opposition from not sharing everything and\r\nchoosing to do it and raise it in Parliament. That is your right.\r\nAll we are raising is, it is an interesting observation.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-99e71951-37c6-440e-81f3-4cbb8002f849\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-99e71951-37c6-440e-81f3-4cbb8002f849\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f68b9132-1dfd-4d19-a640-029c1e9098e4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-f68b9132-1dfd-4d19-a640-029c1e9098e4\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Yee Jenn Jong</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I would\r\nlike to thank the hon Member for clarifying that he does not doubt\r\nmy sincerity.

Similarly, the Workers' Party itself had to convene\r\nour own research and we had to spend a lot of time to do it. So\r\nwhen we were called to share, we shared whatever we could at that\r\npoint in time.

When this House discussed the issue of Ministerial\r\nsalaries in 2007, I focused on the technicalities of the old formula,\r\nand what I thought was wrong with it.

But, as former American President Bill Clinton once observed,\r\na successful country needs both an effective government and a good\r\neconomy. No exceptions. In Singapore, we have both. Other government\r\nleaders, international commentators and experts agree that Singapore,\r\nand what we have achieved, is exceptional. This did not happen by\r\nchance.

I met a group of 30 bright,\r\nyoung undergraduates and I asked them, \"What do you think a Minister\r\nor Prime Minister should be paid?\" None of them was willing to offer\r\na specific figure.

I am very puzzled by the exchanges I have been\r\nhearing in the last few days. Let us go back to the beginning. When\r\nthe hon Mr Gerald Giam was asked about what he shared with the Committee,\r\nhe declined to say, stating and citing that it was private. There\r\nare only two inferences, that is, either the Workers' Party's public\r\nposition differs from its private position or that the Workers'\r\nParty has changed its position since the report came out. Otherwise,\r\nwhy is there anything to hide? Why keep it private? Then NCMP, the\r\nhon Mr Yee, let the cat out of the bag. He made the extraordinary\r\nstatement that the Workers' Party did not share everything with\r\nthe Committee so that they could raise them in this debate. Today,\r\nhe stands up in the House and says that \"Oh, it is not that we did\r\nnot want to share everything that we had. It's that we were in the\r\nmiddle of doing research and we were not ready with all our facts and\r\nfigures but we shared what we had.\" But that is not what he told\r\nthe House yesterday. I have before me what he told the House and\r\nI quote. He said, \"We do not feel that we had to give everything\r\nto the Committee and this is precisely what Parliament is here for.\"\r\nLater on, he said, \"I believe Parliament is where we come up with\r\nanother proposal to be decided upon.\" So, it is quite clear what\r\nthe intention was.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1036</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-96862eb3-cb92-451b-a063-ba75f986de17\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-96862eb3-cb92-451b-a063-ba75f986de17\"><!--a--></a> The Government had set\r\nup an independent Committee which took many months to ponder over\r\nthe proposals, invited feedback from Singaporeans at large, received\r\nover 500 submissions. The whole purpose was to obtain as broad a\r\nfeel as possible for the issue and try to come up with the best\r\npossible proposal and formula in the interests of Singapore. The\r\nWorkers' Party decided to hold back some of their proposals which\r\nthey say were meaningful because they wanted to come to the House\r\nand announce to everyone they have better ideas. In short, they\r\nput their Party's interests before Singapore's interests. I am not\r\ndoubting Mr Yee's sincerity but I doubt his consistency. But it\r\ndoes not matter. Workers' Party can play whatever political games\r\nthey want. It is their prerogative. Playing games and fence-sitting\r\nare the privileges of the Opposition. Politics is about making decisions,\r\nand the Government has one to make. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1156e71c-5f68-4d13-9214-0da306810e85\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-1156e71c-5f68-4d13-9214-0da306810e85\"><!--a--></a>So let us go back and\r\nlook at all the arguments. And there are many different arguments.\r\nBut despite all this, I believe there is much common ground between\r\nSingaporeans on this issue, which is often ignored. I would like\r\nto talk about matters I think we can all agree on. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4121fbb2-0e10-4d0b-b27a-b1b1424fd85a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-4121fbb2-0e10-4d0b-b27a-b1b1424fd85a\"><!--a--></a>First, we can all agree\r\nthat the Prime Minister and the Ministers have very important and\r\ndifficult jobs. They affect almost every aspect of our lives. In\r\nfact, is there any other job which has a greater impact on the success\r\nof Singapore and the well-being of Singaporeans? </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-84d32c1f-ee7e-49c3-84af-74a1c831c18e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-84d32c1f-ee7e-49c3-84af-74a1c831c18e\"><!--a--></a>Second, we can all agree\r\nthat we want first-class public services. When the former Chairman\r\nof the US Federal Reserve, Dr Paul Volcker, was in Singapore last\r\nyear, he was asked what he thought of our policy on salaries. Dr\r\nVolcker is a world-renowned experienced economist. He has been a\r\npublic servant all his life. When introducing him to the audience,\r\nDr Kishore Mahbubani, I recall, made a point that Dr Volcker was\r\ncontent to earn a very modest civil servant salary despite the fact\r\nthat he could have earned much more in the private sector, and I\r\nbelieve that was why he was asked that question by the audience. So\r\nI expected him to talk about the privilege of service. He did not.\r\nDr Volcker's response to the question was simple and astute. He\r\nsaid it was a good idea to pay public servants well as it is important\r\nto ensure good public services. He cited the US Government's response\r\nto Hurricane Katrina and the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico as\r\nevidence that the US public services were seriously lacking. In\r\nshort, in his view, you need good, capable people to provide good\r\nservices, and you should pay good people well. The logic is irrefutable.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bc9e1e45-5675-4855-973c-aff281a5948a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-bc9e1e45-5675-4855-973c-aff281a5948a\"><!--a--></a>The third thing we can\r\nagree on is that not every capable person wants a life in politics.\r\nI dare say most do not. There are very good reasons for this, not\r\nleast of which is the effect on their families. While we do not\r\nhave an intrusive media, there is still a considerable loss of privacy\r\nand a significant impact on personal lives. That includes having\r\nyour spouses and children being openly discussed and their conduct\r\nscrutinised. Who wants that? Many will feel, quite understandably,\r\nthat that is too high a price, whatever the pay.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1037</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-183e7831-cd63-4860-b527-eeb6d6824007\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-183e7831-cd63-4860-b527-eeb6d6824007\"><!--a--></a>The fourth thing we can agree on is that\r\nwe do not want to set salaries so high as to make money the sole\r\nor main reason for seeking office. At the same time, we do not want\r\nit to be so low as to become a disincentive. NCMP Mr Yee says we\r\nare fishing for talent in too small a pond. But if we create financial obstacles\r\nfor good, capable people who are willing to step forward to serve,\r\nwe are only making that pond smaller. No one wants us to do that.\r\nEveryone wants to make public service open to all Singaporeans.\r\nPaying less does not make the pond bigger. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e779b0d3-eec9-44a0-a877-f82636d0d2cc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-e779b0d3-eec9-44a0-a877-f82636d0d2cc\"><!--a--></a>Now we come to the nub:\r\nwhat should we pay capable people who perform critical jobs? This\r\nbrings us to the other \"s\" word, which tends to dominate this debate:\r\nsacrifice. It has been said that public service is a privilege and\r\nnot a sacrifice. Again, no one disputes that. But that is not the\r\nargument. The argument is that leaders should make sacrifices because\r\nit demonstrates that they care about what they are doing. That is\r\nanother thing we can all agree on: we want our leaders to care about\r\nSingapore. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-33ad815f-bdd8-47a5-a8ec-2074c742fef3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-33ad815f-bdd8-47a5-a8ec-2074c742fef3\"><!--a--></a>But why do we look at\r\nsacrifice only in money terms? I think we are asking ourselves the\r\nwrong question. It is not how much our leaders should sacrifice,\r\nbut what we want from them. I do not want someone who tells me his\r\nbest quality is that he loves his country or that money is not important\r\nto him. Because these are the easiest things to say, and there will\r\nbe no shortage of people who will tell that just to win approval. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d8226c7b-b65a-44c6-808e-b902b1c73506\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-d8226c7b-b65a-44c6-808e-b902b1c73506\"><!--a--></a>What do I want from our\r\nleaders?

I want\r\nthem to be fair minded, hard working, compassionate and of unimpeachable\r\ncharacter. I want leaders who will not be satisfied until every Singaporean\r\nhas a home and the means to a better life. I want to know that if\r\nthere is an outbreak of a deadly disease like SARS, a terrorist\r\nbomb goes off, or Singapore faces an economic crisis, we have leaders\r\nwho have the courage, intelligence, experience and determination\r\nto do what is necessary for the good of Singapore and Singaporeans.\r\nI want leaders who understand that their job involves a sacred trust,\r\na vow to devote every fibre, every moment, every thought, every\r\neverything, in service to their country. That is the true sacrifice\r\nI think every Singaporean should demand. And if we get the quality of\r\npeople right, the question of quantity of pay answers itself. I\r\nbelieve more Singaporeans would agree with that.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5852a4d7-bbfc-40e0-b351-0da8de25758a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-5852a4d7-bbfc-40e0-b351-0da8de25758a\"><!--a--></a>That leads me to one more\r\nthing we can all agree on. It is impossible to answer the question\r\nof salaries in a manner which will satisfy everyone. And many have\r\nsaid so in this House. Even the Workers' Party agrees that there\r\nis no right or wrong figure. I would, however, make two suggestions.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b9022a9d-6ddb-40f9-bfc9-aa4527329ad7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-b9022a9d-6ddb-40f9-bfc9-aa4527329ad7\"><!--a--></a>Like others before me,\r\nMr Baey included, I suggest that the proposed formula be tweaked\r\nto cap the salaries for the Government's term of office, with an\r\nannual increment for inflation. In other words, salaries will not\r\nrise if the benchmark median salary rises. That would create more\r\ncertainty and, more importantly, put paid to arguments that this\r\nGovernment will pursue policies to favour the top earners to increase\r\nits own pay. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e34b8255-2352-4cca-bf3c-1305dd977d68\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-e34b8255-2352-4cca-bf3c-1305dd977d68\"><!--a--></a>I would also like the\r\nGovernment to do more to keep Singaporeans informed and engaged\r\non this issue. There is still much misunderstanding over salaries,\r\nand we cannot have a proper dialogue if people are working off different\r\nfacts. For example, there are many Singaporeans who still believe\r\nthat MPs will receive pensions although that was discontinued many\r\nyears ago. Some even believe that MPs' and Ministers' salaries are\r\ntax-free. Not true. Within days of the release of the report, Mr\r\nGerard Ee had to come out publicly and say that some had misunderstood\r\nhis report and what it said. And despite the enormous publicity\r\non this subject, some are still unclear about the details of the\r\nnew package. Although I know some would prefer not to keep talking\r\nabout this issue, I support the proposal for the formula to be revised\r\nevery five years. I believe we should welcome every opportunity\r\nto debate it so that there will be\r\na wider and better understanding of the facts and the arguments.\r\nIt will also help if we publish annually and in clear terms the\r\naverage pay package of Ministers, so that we can demolish mischievous allegations\r\nthat Ministers would secretly earn more through discretionary and\r\nundeclared payments. This is fertile ground for those who seek to\r\nbreed discontent and cynicism. Let us not give them the opportunity\r\nto mislead and divide Singaporeans. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1038</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7bcd0fca-ab0f-49cc-8d36-1b398f3796ca\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-7bcd0fca-ab0f-49cc-8d36-1b398f3796ca\"><!--a--></a>I end with a final proposition\r\nwe can agree on. We want Singapore to remain an exceptional nation because\r\nthat is really the only thing that keeps us relevant. This exceptionalism\r\nshould not only be in the performance of our economy or the efficiency\r\nof our public services. It should also be in the trust and relationship\r\nbetween the Government and the people it serves. All around the\r\nworld, politics and politicians are viewed with great cynicism.\r\nCynicism weakens the Government, democracy and our country, and\r\nwe cannot let that happen to us.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-fafba151-7c6f-4975-8a19-d24acf154d28\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-fafba151-7c6f-4975-8a19-d24acf154d28\"><!--a--></a>I, therefore, support\r\nthe revision of salaries. The new formula is more relevant and intuitive.\r\nIt deals with some of the criticisms of the old formula and does\r\naway with inequities like pensions. A thirty-plus percent cut is\r\non any view significant. The National Bonus better reflects performance.\r\nEven the Workers' Party agrees that a monthly wage of $55,000 a\r\nmonth is fair. And as Mr Vikram Nair pointed out yesterday, even\r\nthe difference in bonus computations may not amount to very much\r\na different sum. So we now have a sound basis for the Government\r\nto move forward, strengthen connections with Singaporeans, focus\r\non the difficult problems we know to be around the corner, and deliver\r\non its promise for a better life for all Singaporeans. Because in\r\nthe final analysis, that is all that really counts, and I think\r\nwe can all agree on that.

We talked about doing away with the current\r\nbenchmark of tying it to the 2/3M48 formula. We talked about KPIs\r\nfor the Ministers and measuring the Ministers' bonus against the achievement\r\nof those KPIs. We talked about doing away with pensions.

Is it because what they shared privately is different from\r\nwhat they disclosed publicly? Is it because what they disclosed\r\nis different from the position they are now taking? Why does it\r\nhave to be private? He is a politician. He serves the public. He\r\nshould be more transparent. Well, at least he believes in transparency\r\n\u2013 a statement which many of his colleagues make. Then, when Mr Yee\r\ncomes up, and he tries to defend Mr Giam, he says and I again quote,\r\n\"We do not feel we have to give everything to the Committee and\r\nthis is precisely what Parliament is here for.\" And then he says,\r\n\"I believe Parliament is where we come up with another proposal\r\nto be decided on.\" </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-029eaa51-4f81-4969-8272-d31bf126d5e8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-029eaa51-4f81-4969-8272-d31bf126d5e8\"><!--a--></a>So it is very clear what\r\ntheir position was. They were not willing to share what they disclosed\r\nto the Committee or what they shared with the Committee, and they\r\nwanted to reserve some arguments for Parliament. And the only reason\r\nwhy they want to do that is because they want to come up and say\r\nand tell the whole world that \"I am cleverer because I have a better\r\nidea, and let me tell everyone about it.\" Never mind that months,\r\nhours, a lot of resources were spent by Mr Gerard Ee's Committee\r\nto put together the best possible package for Singapore.

But the Prime Minister and his Cabinet\r\nacted swiftly. Within days of the General Election, an independent\r\ncommittee was set up to relook and review the salary formula.

From salary or bonus discussions\r\nin a small business to a large corporate enterprise, and, of course,\r\nto a large national debate like this, there are many emotional arguments\r\nover how much is enough or not. What is the value of the public\r\nservice ethos and what is the appropriate level of sacrifice? Invariably,\r\nsuch arguments are also shaped and contextualised by the subjective\r\npersonal experiences and diverse backgrounds of the person making\r\nthe argument. Different perspectives will give you different answers.\r\nBut I would argue, however, that in this debate, we should consider\r\nthe issue dispassionately and without the emotion. We should start\r\nby settling on what we want to achieve and then work out how we\r\ncan get there. Cast aside the emotion and look at it logically.\r\nAnd if this Committee's report brings us closer to what we want\r\nto achieve, then we should all endorse this White Paper. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d5917018-0a6f-48d8-9bff-4b93e36b0c90\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-d5917018-0a6f-48d8-9bff-4b93e36b0c90\"><!--a--></a>In looking at what we\r\nwant to achieve, let me first start with some basic home truths\r\nwhich I believe are already quite indisputable. Singapore has come\r\na long way in just over 45 years. We have been transformed from\r\na tiny island to a bustling developed nation. We managed to do this\r\nbecause of the sheer determination, belief and strength of the founding\r\ngeneration of our political leaders and the competence of their\r\nsucceeding generations. We now almost take for granted the economic\r\nand socio-political stability of our country that is only the envy\r\nof others. But the truth is, had it not been for a strong and visionary\r\ngovernment, it could also easily have been very different for us.\r\nJust a short hop and skip from here will show you how we could have\r\nturned out so very differently. And we cannot do worse if we assume\r\nthat this state will remain constant. In fact, it can be very transient.\r\nIf we falter, we can be sure that our neighbours will seize upon\r\nit and take advantage. So we have to maintain our position well\r\nahead of the competition. To do so, our Government and each Member\r\nof the Cabinet and each political office holder has to be capable,\r\nhas to be committed and has to have creative talent married to astute\r\nleadership to get us home. We need the best and the brightest talents\r\nto be brought into public service as our Ministers and political\r\nappointment holders. That much, surely, must be a given. We want to\r\nbe able to choose from men and women of the highest quality and\r\nwho are capable of making it to the very top of their chosen profession. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-712a894a-7f70-4467-98bf-53587a52011c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-712a894a-7f70-4467-98bf-53587a52011c\"><!--a--></a>So we know what we want.\r\nThe next question is, in designing a remuneration system, how do\r\nwe achieve that? How do we bring the best and brightest into the\r\npublic service? That, really, is the debate on this motion. Because\r\nthe best and the brightest are the people who are either at or have\r\nthe potential to be at the very top of the private sector or their\r\nown chosen profession, can we get away by not paying these people\r\ncompetitive salaries? Can we just say, \"You come in, we pay you\r\nX number of times some civil service salary \u2013 five times, nine times\"\r\n\u2013 even if it is a fraction of what he might earn as a top private-sector\r\nprofessional \u2013 and expect them to step forward? I think if we look\r\nat that alone, the answer is obvious. If we did that, we would lose\r\nout. Singaporeans will lose out. We have to be realistic. In today's\r\nglobal world and economy, the options available to a talented and\r\nhighly motivated individual are dizzying. They have an array of\r\npaths and options, both in Singapore and abroad, and we have to recognise\r\nthat those options are the true opportunity costs of stepping up\r\nto public service. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a49ebcbe-4352-451e-a83f-9a502eb0dfbb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-a49ebcbe-4352-451e-a83f-9a502eb0dfbb\"><!--a--></a>But let me be very clear,\r\npublic service is a noble calling. We have heard many of the Members\r\nin this House say that. And there is no place for anyone coming\r\nforward to serve because of the financial rewards alone. It is a\r\ncherished office, and a great honour to be chosen by the people\r\nof Singapore to lead and to represent them. But all of us in this\r\nHouse know that. We all know that. We all know it is a privilege\r\nand we all understand the intrinsic value of political service or\r\nwe would not be here. If we would just consider the amount of time\r\nwe, as Members of Parliament, spent in the work that we do against\r\nthe additional allowances that we receive as MPs, I think it would\r\nbe fair to say that most of us would not be financially better off\r\nin stepping up to serve. But let us not milk it with rhetoric and\r\nmake emotional points and let it cloud our assessment of what the\r\nright approach ought to be. It is not, as the hon Member Mr Chen Show Mao says, \"A question\r\nof placing competitive salaries as the first principle.\" They are\r\nall important principles and they work together. It is about finding\r\nthe right balance. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1041</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d9ce62a5-c76b-437b-b5c3-2b0b759603c1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-d9ce62a5-c76b-437b-b5c3-2b0b759603c1\"><!--a--></a>The starting point in\r\nrecruiting a political office holder must still be that candidate's\r\nsense of public spiritedness, of service, of desire and of a need\r\nto want to put Singapore first, and his ability to deliver. Those\r\nare the primary considerations. And if we have that, then we will\r\nbe considered. And in considering, the salary must be a neutral\r\nfactor. That is where the salary formula comes into play. We must\r\nfind a way to neutralise salaries as being a decisive factor for\r\nor against entry to public service, and a balance has to be struck.\r\nIn my view, whilst tangible sacrifices are called for to give our\r\npolitical leaders moral authority to govern and to lead, the level\r\nof salaries must not itself be a disincentive for talented people\r\nconsidering a public sector career. It would be naive for us to\r\nassume that we can always rely on other people's charity in coming\r\nforward to public service at huge cost to themselves and their families.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4452a968-b10b-4121-8a42-16217ff73fd1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-4452a968-b10b-4121-8a42-16217ff73fd1\"><!--a--></a>As the Prime Minister\r\nhas noted in his speech, Members of the front bench are here because\r\nof that same sense of public spiritedness and not for financial\r\nconsiderations.

We might discount it, as the Committee has\r\nrecommended 40%, but as a matter of policy, it has to move in tandem\r\nwith private-sector pay scales. And it is not a question of being\r\nelitist. Rather, it is just recognising the appropriate opportunity\r\ncosts and setting up a salary scale that gives us the best chance\r\nof attracting that top talent. Let us ask ourselves, if we want\r\nas our political leaders people who are capable of making it to\r\nthe top of their professional career, then, on balance, where are we\r\nmore likely to find that top talent? In the higher income scale\r\nor the lower? And, as has been repeated several times too, I am\r\nnot suggesting for a moment that a person outside the top 1,000\r\nSingaporean earners will not necessarily be considered for political\r\noffice. But that is not the question. The point is, in designing\r\nthe formula, we have to look at where that talent pool is likely\r\nto be, and what the true commensurate opportunity costs would be.\r\nAnd as the Minister of State, Mrs Josephine Teo, says, \"That is\r\na basic HR tactic.\"</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7ff7014c-ba6e-4493-a1e0-30b3e7330de1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-7ff7014c-ba6e-4493-a1e0-30b3e7330de1\"><!--a--></a>It is, therefore, unrealistic\r\nto de-couple political remuneration from market influences, and\r\nI would support the Committee's recommendation to retain the link\r\nto the market, with a discount. I would add that I see a visible\r\ntangible discount as being necessary to reflect that it is a deliberate\r\nmark-down from the market to signify the sacrifice and add to the\r\nmoral authority of our leaders. In addition, I also think that a\r\nsignificant improvement has been made to broaden the reference points\r\nto the top 1,000 Singaporean earners and not just any earner in\r\nthe chosen six professions. The old formula was debated vigorously\r\nin this House in 2007. I did not have that privilege of contributing\r\nto that debate.

I have taken some numbers from the Committee's report and I\r\nhave also extracted propositions from the speeches made by several\r\nMembers of the Workers' Party the last few days. If you look at\r\nthe base scenario of a 13-month package and -- there is a typographical\r\nerror here -- it should be $46,750. That is based on paragraph 89,\r\npage 33 of the Committee's report. That is a 15% discount of $55,000.\r\nThat gets you to a base salary of $607,750. You contrast that base\r\nsalary with the recommended proposal of $55,000 on a 13-month package\r\nthat gets you to more than $700,000 as a base salary. If you add\r\nthe bonus -- the Committee's proposal for the benchmark bonus at\r\nmid tier would be $1.1 million. That is based on thirteen months\r\nplus the seven months which includes the bonus at $55,000, and that\r\ngets you to $1.1 million.

That has been the\r\nhallmark of Singapore's political-remuneration principle and I am\r\nhappy to see it continue; and happier that on that score, there\r\nis at least consensus with the Workers' Party. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e93101f9-388b-4c43-b4a9-b41a42f317cd\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-e93101f9-388b-4c43-b4a9-b41a42f317cd\"><!--a--></a>In the period before and\r\nafter the Committee's report was published, one argument against\r\npolitical salaries which kept surfacing was that our salaries were\r\nnot comparable to international standards. Again, we have heard\r\nthat several times, and that on the salary of our own Prime Minister,\r\nwe could get both Barack Obama and Tony Blair combined. But, is\r\nthat what we really think or want? It must have been tempting for\r\nthis Government to have said that you know what, let us get paid\r\nlike Obama with the 132-room White House accommodation thrown in,\r\nan expense account, a private jet, paid vacations, and a private chef. It\r\nmight have been easier. According to BBC reports, senators in Italy\r\nalmost double their official remuneration with expense allowances\r\nas well as free rail, free flight tickets, and so on. In France,\r\npoliticians get very low interest rates on housing and what is not\r\ncommonly known is that if a Member of Parliament loses their seat\r\nin an election, he or she remains on full pay for half a year, and then\r\na gradually declining proportion of the salary for a further two-and-a-half\r\nyears. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1043</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2e803b01-3c38-4480-a587-97a3ce6d0343\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-2e803b01-3c38-4480-a587-97a3ce6d0343\"><!--a--></a>The Prime Minister has\r\ntouched on what some of the members of the parliament in the UK\r\nhave claimed for. And in the UK today, some three years later, it\r\nstill remains an issue which continues to bedevil the proper functioning\r\nof parliament because they cannot work out how to really pay the\r\nMPs, and worst of all, this casts a great shadow, not just on the\r\nintegrity of the parliamentarians but on the office of the parliamentarian\r\nitself. A number of parliamentarians, both of the front and back\r\nbenches, from both sides of the House, including the Speaker of\r\nthe House of Commons, all resigned in the wake of those disclosures,\r\nand some peers were also charged for false accounting. So, is this\r\nwhat we really want? Why are the critics of our formula seemingly\r\ncontent to accept and indeed advocate what is practised by other\r\ncountries: a low official pay but supplemented by a variety of perks\r\nand benefits? It is a complete paradox and totally regressive. What\r\ndo these perks cover? How much, for what period? For the spouse\r\nas well? Today, the claim is for home improvement, travel; tomorrow,\r\nit could be a whole lot more.

This is not even taking into account a pension which\r\nex-Prime Minister John Howard continues to enjoy, and the fact that\r\nsome of these benefits or the benefits available to him in his tenure\r\nas a Prime Minister would continue to be available to him and his spouse\r\neven after he has stepped down from office. Can any serious comparison\r\nbe made between the remuneration system of Australia and what the\r\nCommittee has recommended? Sir, surely not. We should not even be\r\ncomparing ourselves with governments who lack the political will\r\nand courage to be completely transparent with what each and every\r\npolitical office holder is paid. Sir, the value of a clean, transparent\r\nwage system cannot be under-estimated. What you see, is what you\r\nget.

The corollary of the market benchmarking is that our\r\npolitical office holders must therefore be held accountable like\r\nthe private sector, and subject to the same rigours and risks. In\r\norder for Singaporeans to support remuneration formula, Sir, they\r\nmust have the confidence and conviction that our Ministers and office\r\nholders will be held accountable to those very high standards, and\r\nI am glad to have heard the Prime Minister re-affirm that belief. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-1d18d7b5-8daf-41bf-8546-fe1625f03eac\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-1d18d7b5-8daf-41bf-8546-fe1625f03eac\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1def7fd8-f3c8-408b-b085-79e21aab94e6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-1def7fd8-f3c8-408b-b085-79e21aab94e6\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Speaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Tong, you\r\nhave one minute.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-e3a945bc-2084-4e3d-b488-da11f3858fd3\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-e3a945bc-2084-4e3d-b488-da11f3858fd3\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b936ddd4-ab5d-4863-b090-e2a464c1d486\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-b936ddd4-ab5d-4863-b090-e2a464c1d486\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nYes, Sir.

It is, however, not perfect, it must be tested in application.\r\nIt will evolve and I am sure it will continue to be fine-tuned at\r\neach review which the Government\r\nhas said it will do every five years. There may be still some Singaporeans\r\nwho will remain unconvinced; it will take some time to convince\r\nthem, but we should and I hope the arguments can be considered with\r\nan open mind, dispassionately and without emotion.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1044</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-206c17cc-35cd-44c4-95d1-e8f0dfed069d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-206c17cc-35cd-44c4-95d1-e8f0dfed069d\"><!--a--></a>As the hon Member <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">Ms Denise Phua said, because\r\nthere are so many different views of the proverbial elephant, perhaps\r\nthis is just an issue on which there may never be consensus.

In his speech on Monday, Deputy\r\nPrime Minister Teo said that the most important criterion for anyone\r\nseeking political office is the motivation to serve the people and\r\nthe nation. Mr Chen Show Mao stated that \"political service is a\r\ncalling and that it is a privilege accorded by the electorate to\r\nserve Singaporeans\" and that it is primarily \"a privilege, not a\r\nburden or a sacrifice\". These are similar sentiments, albeit expressed\r\nin different ways. But then, we must ask ourselves: to whom will\r\nSingaporeans accord this privilege? Singaporeans are discerning. They\r\nwill not accord the privilege of leadership to just any and everybody.\r\nThey know what good government entails. They also know what kind\r\nof Ministers they want. The type of person to whom Singaporeans\r\nwill accord the privilege to serve them, must be a person with certain\r\nqualities. These include integrity, honesty, compassion, a desire\r\nto act for the better good of all as well as ability, leadership\r\nskills, communication skills, organisational skills and technical\r\nskills.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d6e774cf-c82b-4fb8-bf53-aae175b8cb52\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-d6e774cf-c82b-4fb8-bf53-aae175b8cb52\"><!--a--></a>But where do you find\r\nthese people? Chances are people with these qualities would by their\r\nvery nature tend to be successful and would normally have risen\r\nto the forefront of any organisation in which they work, whether\r\nit be public sector or private sector. And this means that people\r\nin those positions would command a certain remuneration and have\r\nmore options and choices. And this brings us right back to the first\r\nprinciple on which the Committee based its recommendations which\r\nis that salaries must be competitive so that people of the right\r\ncalibre are not deterred from stepping forward to serve. So the first\r\nprinciple is not inconsistent with the concept that political service\r\nis a calling and a privilege. In fact, the first principle is intended\r\nto help us to get the right kind of persons to whom Singaporeans\r\nwill accord the privilege to serve them.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-dcb3f179-b7ba-4bbb-84f4-97aa85f3bc63\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-dcb3f179-b7ba-4bbb-84f4-97aa85f3bc63\"><!--a--></a>Let me deal with the third\r\nprinciple now.

The\r\nWorkers' Party mentioned that their proposals were derived after\r\nreviewing the remuneration systems in 12 developed economies, including\r\nthe UK and US. Now, the UK and US are the two most often cited examples\r\nof where their politicians earn far less than ours.

The Government\r\nhas provided the method of calculation of an office-holder's pension\r\nin detail and stated that the maximum amount is about 11% of the\r\nannual salary in the previous framework. Why have we provided the\r\ncalculation method and not the amount for each individual?

But we have indeed learnt from\r\nother countries, and the most important lesson that we have learnt,\r\nis that providing allowances and benefits is a veritable minefield,\r\nand hence the most important lesson that we have learnt is to go\r\nfor clean wages, so that we can avoid such thick books, such big\r\nwebsites, and such huge problems of abuse. Sir, if we put up a website\r\nto account for usage of benefits, the only variable item that will\r\nbe there is how much a Minister claims for dental treatment \u2013 so\r\nthat is a maximum of $70, and I suppose we will all know how many\r\ntimes he goes to the dentist, and whether he has used up his maximum\r\nclaim of $70. Mr Pritam Singh knows that this is the position of\r\nthe Government.

It was considered recently\r\nlast year in Hisham's case. The High Court held that its power to\r\ngrant or vary bail under section 97(1) would be redundant if it\r\nwere qualified by other provisions, specifically section 95(1).\r\nAnd I think the statement is very clear, it was directly on point\r\nin contrast to the earlier case which I think was decided in 2005.\r\nAnd our view is that the statutory language is clear, the judgement\r\nis clear, and the latest decision sets out the law. Nevertheless,\r\nI thank the Member for raising it, allowing me to clarify that the\r\ndiscretion is unfettered, and if the issue arises again, we will\r\ncertainly amend, to put that beyond doubt. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4c2522ac-8cf3-46c5-955c-f6f01d8557d6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-c85b0750-9ca2-4584-8962-6e7f2faa7fa4__id-4c2522ac-8cf3-46c5-955c-f6f01d8557d6\"><!--a--></a>On the second concern\r\non the power of the Commissioner of Police (CP) to authorise the\r\ncarrying, possession, and so on, of truncheons, handcuffs. Ms Lim's\r\npoint, and again it is a valid point, is about really the abuse\r\nof such powers. A number of our laws provide for law enforcement\r\nofficers to carry such equipment needed for their work. For example,\r\nof course, the Police Force Act, Immigration Act, Misuse of Drugs\r\nAct, including the Miscellaneous Offences Act (MOA). The present\r\namendment supplements those provisions by giving the CP the general\r\npower to authorise the carrying and possession and control of these\r\nequipment. But before he gives any authorisation, the Commissioner must\r\nbe satisfied that it is necessary in the circumstances and appropriate\r\nfor the function to be given. And authorisations would be granted\r\nto law enforcement officers who need to carry or possess the relevant\r\nequipment in the course of their work. And that authorisation will\r\nhave to be stringently assessed; conditions will be imposed on authorised\r\npersons, including proper training for the use of the equipment;\r\nlimits on where, when and the purposes for which the equipment can\r\nbe used; proper safekeeping and issuance of the equipment; and the\r\ntype and specifications of the equipment. And the person who breaches\r\nthe condition will be acting outside his authority to carry, possess,\r\ncontrol or use the equipment. If he does so in a public place, meaning\r\nif he acts contrary to the authorisation in public place, that would\r\nbe a criminal offence. And if there is an unauthorised use of force,\r\nthat may disclose further offences. And those acts will be seriously\r\ninvestigated, any abuse of powers will be disciplined or prosecuted,\r\nand their authorisations will also, of course, be revoked. So I\r\nthank the Member for raising the question and allowing me to set\r\nout the framework within which these powers can be exercised. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-dc0e3fd2-e26a-4f4c-a767-43644852409b\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-c85b0750-9ca2-4584-8962-6e7f2faa7fa4__id-dc0e3fd2-e26a-4f4c-a767-43644852409b\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ee3f5323-570e-4041-a07d-ac392849340e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-c85b0750-9ca2-4584-8962-6e7f2faa7fa4__id-ee3f5323-570e-4041-a07d-ac392849340e\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Thank you,\r\nSir. Two clarifications for the Minister. The Minister mentioned\r\nin response that, for the MOA amendments, it is envisaged that the\r\nCommissioner of Police (CP) would be authorising law enforcement\r\nofficers to carry such items. But the existing provision actually\r\nforesees people from the private sector doing that. The existing\r\nsection 22(a) talks about private security. I would like the Minister\r\nto clarify whether there are going be, besides private security,\r\nother people from the private sector within CP's radar, for such\r\nauthorisation. Secondly, \u2013 it is a suggestion \u2013 I wonder if the Ministry\r\nhas considered that for these private sector people, whether there\r\nshould be additional insurance\r\nagainst public liability taken out to protect possible members of\r\nthe public who may need to lodge civil claims for compensation,\r\nat least to ensure that their claims would be met.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-1c897917-deb1-4690-b64f-326587d416b5\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-c85b0750-9ca2-4584-8962-6e7f2faa7fa4__id-1c897917-deb1-4690-b64f-326587d416b5\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1067</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-51c4cdb6-ad02-4607-b301-fd36b9b94619\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-c85b0750-9ca2-4584-8962-6e7f2faa7fa4__id-51c4cdb6-ad02-4607-b301-fd36b9b94619\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr K Shanmugam</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Thank you.\r\nI think I will have to answer both questions on behalf of the Minister\r\nfor Home Affairs.
