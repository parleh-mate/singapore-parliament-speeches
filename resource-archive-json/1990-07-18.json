Secondly, I also want to declare that I am a council member of the Enterprise Development Council. This Council was formed by the Economic Development Board to promote and develop local enterprises to play a bigger role in Singapore's economic growth in the 1990s. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Second Minister for Defence (Services)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Second Minister for Defence (Services) (BG Lee Hsien Loong) (for the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal purpose of setting up the Singapore Technology (ST) companies is to provide technical and industrial support to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), to enhance its operational effectiveness and strengthen our economic defence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ST cannot do this solely by undertaking work for the SAF. No defence group in the world does this unless self-sufficiency is to be achieved at all costs. Strengths and capabilities which the SAF will need only in a contingency will almost by definition be surplus to requirements in peacetime. The same technology used by the SAF can often also be employed for civilian purposes. For example, both military data terminals and civilian personal computers require similar integrated circuits and printed circuit boards. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> To develop a capability for one and not to use it for the other would be wasteful. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF's policy is therefore that ST companies should, besides SAF work, also undertake industrial and commercial activities which have synergies with, support or extend the core defence-related activities. This may mean \"crowding out\" the private sector from the business. But from the point of view of the nation as a whole, it is better for the defence industries to do this and channel the private sector into other areas of business, rather than for the defence industries to keep their surplus capacity idle in order to give the business to the private sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ST companies are required to maintain a clear business focus. They only undertake those non-military activities which make sense for the core mission of their companies, where there is synergy with the defence business. They are not allowed to practise predatory pricing, or take advantage of their Government-owned status to hide costs and win contracts. They must compete for business on equal terms with private sector companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronics and computer systems are pervasive and important components of modern weapon systems. While we cannot become totally self-sufficient in these areas, the ST companies can develop a comprehensive capability in these systems, to give the SAF the extra technological edge. This is why ST companies manufacture and sell personal computers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that ST companies are also agents for personal computers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, indeed. The SAF Enterprises (SAFE) retails many brands of PCs as well as other consumer goods as part of its business. In addition, SCS, which is an information technology systems house, provides PCs and other work stations as part of its total system solutions. That means, when it sells a consumer a package, it is selling a solution - hardware, software, integration, training support. Therefore, SCS has a standing business relationship with PC vendors, which reduces the cost of such total systems offered to the clients. It is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> better for the clients. It gives them a more attractive package. Once SCS is a value-added supplier of PCs, there is no reason for SCS to turn down, customers who walk in and want to buy PCs off the shelf. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that the advertisements by the ST companies were on selling PCs as stand-alone hardware only? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know what advertisement the Member is referring to. I presume it was the advertisement for the Lynk computer which was designed, manufactured and sold by Chartered Electronics Industries (CEI). \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong:</b> I am referring to the ST company which is the agent for the AST personal computers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, rather than argue what advertisements have been published or not, I take the position that even if they were published entirely as the Member has maintained, I see nothing wrong with it. Why should a commercial company, making a commercial decision, seeing a business opportunity, not go in to offer a service which their customers value and find useful? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the point is actually we want to maximise the limited manpower pool that we have. The PC area is not a very high-tech area. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tan, ask your question, please. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong:</b> Sir, I would like the Minister to consider whether this is in line with maximising the productivity of our limited manpower. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the line between what the Government should do, what the Government-owned companies should do, and what privately-owned companies should do, is a matter of degree, judgment and choice. From MTI's point of view, it makes absolutely no difference when a company sells a computer, whether the shareholder happens to be the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government, or happens to be a private entrepreneur on his own behalf; provided he is operating on a level playing field, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> provided that there is no hidden subsidy from the Government, provided that the Government is not favouring its own company and, therefore, enabling it to compete unfairly with the private sector. If the Government company can give the private sector a run for its money, so be it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong:</b> Sir, I am wondering whether the Minister will comment on the statistics provided in the directory of the Singapore Federation of Computer Industry that there were five Government-owned companies employing 1,135 computer professionals as against 50 private companies with 4,802 employees. This works out to an average of 227 computer professionals per Government-owned company and 96 computer professionals per privately-owned company. Is it not true that the manpower has been drained away into the Government-owned companies? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if tomorrow the Government decides to sell off one of its companies with 220 people to a private sector entrepreneur for $10 million or what ever it is worth, the averages are even out overnight. Does it make one jot of difference to the economy? Which is better for us? That whoever owns the company and whoever has the enterprise gets the individuals and puts them to productive use, or that the Government and its companies, when these have talent and ideas, stand by idle and do nothing in order that others who are less competitive can come in and monopolise the market at the expense of consumers? Surely it is better for resources to be used optimally and consumers to be better served. They are not forced to go to Government companies. They can, if they wish. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecom - the next question - is not compelled to buy computers from the Government. In fact, we encourage them to tender or to explore R&amp;D contracts with whoever is available. If the Government company is the best one, so be it.

The Member is probably referring to Teleview terminals which will be used very shortly when the Teleview system is available publicly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to keep costs down and to make the Teleview system as widely available as possible, and as soon as possible, Telecom has, instead of doing inhouse R &amp; D and manufacturing its own terminals, decided to work together with other companies that have such capabilities. After assessing the R&amp;D and manufacturing capabilities of a number of possible partners, Telecom has proceeded with two projects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the research and development into a dedicated Teleview terminal to be used specifically for Teleview purposes. Telecom has been working with Marconi Command and Control System Ltd of the United Kingdom on this project for some years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, Telecom is also developing together with Chartered Electronics Industries Pte Ltd a special Teleview terminal, an intelligent terminal, as it is called, with the ability to serve also as a personal computer. It will be a Teleview-cum-PC terminal. Such dual purpose terminals can help keep the cost of the terminal down and to make it attractive for large numbers of people to get on to the Teleview system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecom and the Chartered Electronics Industries Pte Ltd are also developing together other special accessories, including hardware cards and specialised software. These can be used to adapt any IBM AT or compatible personal computer to access Teleview. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Teleview system is the most advanced photo-videotext presently available. Terminals to access Teleview are not available off the shelf either in Singapore or in any other country. Hence, the need for joint development with the different companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong:</b> Sir, is a tender called for choosing of partners in the research? Does the partnership in development also include the manufacturing of PCs? Are local companies being approached for such a venture? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, as far as research and development is concerned, it is not possible to go out with a tender and ask for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> participants. Therefore no such tender has been made. The engineers in Telecom are familiar with the capabilities of the different companies in Singapore, so, what Telecom has done is to approach a number of companies which may have similar capabilities with talent that may fit Telecom's R &amp; D requirements. Telecom has looked at a number of these companies, and on the basis of the most attractive offer and the best fit with the objective of getting the Teleview system available as soon as possible, Telecom has settled on Chartered Electronics Industries. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong:</b> Sir, when the development has completed, will Telecom consider tendering out the PCs rather than following up with CEI in the manufacture of PCs? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, part of the contract for the R&amp;D, which involves quite obviously capital investment on the part of the company itself, is for the manufacture of the terminal that will be developed. I want to emphasise to the Member that it is not a PC that is being developed. It is an intelligent Teleview terminal. Because the components have such a large overlap with that of a conventional PC, modifications have been made to the terminal so that it can function as a PC. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong:</b> Sir, is it not then that what Telecom is doing is not in line with the Government's intention that the private sector be the engine of growth? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, I do not understand the Member's question. As far as I see it, and as my colleague, the Second Minister for Defence (Services) has mentioned a moment ago, a Government-owned company is as much a part of the private sector and the engine of growth. Just because the ownership is in the hands of the Finance Minister does not make that contributive of company any less important. If the company were to be sold tomorrow, it does not make one bit of a difference to the economy of Singapore. What is important is that they are able to be competitive. If Telecom had found another partner in Singapore, Telecom would have been just as happy working with that other company, developing the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> intelligent terminal. And then as part of the contract, to tie up with the manufacture of that particular terminal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been working together with a British company for a long time producing the Mark I terminal. The Member has not been unhappy with that all this time. We are now developing with Marconi the Mark II terminal. The Member has not been uncomfortable with that at all. So I do not understand why the Member should be uncomfortable now that we are developing a terminal with a local company, Chartered Electronics Industries. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong:</b> Sir, is the Minister saying that a Government-owned company is no different from privately-owned companies and that a privately-owned company stands on the same equal footing as a Government-owned company? Secondly, I agree with the Minister that I have no quarrels with Marconi, because we do not have the technology. But here the question is: can Marconi not work with a locally-owned company which manufactures PCs instead of the Government? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, the Member is obviously not aware of what is going on. It is not the technology of Marconi that we are interested. It is the expertise. We had done this job ourselves. Telecom has completed the development of the Teleview system. The system is likely to be much better than systems available elsewhere in the world. We could have done it all by ourselves if we so wish. But it would probably take us a few more years, by which time it may be superseded by new technology. So when you are working in a high-tech industry, you have to move quickly. And rather than go out and recruit a very large number of research engineers into Telecom to funnel them into this particular project so that we can bring the project to fruition as quickly as possible, Telecom does what is most natural, which is to scout around to see where talent in this field is. We found it in CEI. That is how the project has progressed the way it did. So we are able to launch the Teleview system soon. There will be three ways of accessing the Teleview system. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, through the Marconi-built Teleview dedicated terminal. In other words, that terminal can only access Teleview and nothing else. Secondly, we are working together with CEI to come out with an intelligent Teleview terminal which will modify the previous terminal to give it the capabilities of a Personal Computer. Thirdly, for members of the public who have already got a PC, what Telecom and CEI are doing is to develop new hardware and software which can adapt the owner's own PC to access Teleview. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong:</b> Sir, is the Minister saying that Telecom has actually scouted around Singapore and found that the expertise in CEI is not found in any local company? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, the expertise in CEI gives Telecom the best fit and it gives Telecom the greatest confidence that the project can be handled within cost and within schedule. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong:</b> My question is whether Telecom has actually gone round to see the local companies and found that the expertise was not there and that was why Telecom had to resort to CEI? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, we have looked at a number of companies.

Since 11th August 1989, the income ceiling for flats purchased directly from HDB has been raised from $4,000 to $5,000 per month for a nuclear \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> family and from $6,500 to $8,000 per month for an extended family. Based on the Labour Force Survey, 90% of the households in Singapore would qualify to purchase HDB flats directly from the Board with the latest revised income ceilings. HDB has also lifted the income ceiling for purchase of HUDC and resale HDB flats in the open market. There is no need to revise the income ceilings for purchase of HDB flats in the immediate future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the income ceiling for rental flats to Singapore citizens is currently set at $800 per month and a subsidised rental is charged. Rental flats are for citizens in the lower income groups who cannot afford to purchase home ownership flats. Households with incomes of more than $800 per month should be able to afford the monthly instalment payment for a 3-room flat in the New Town zone, and are encouraged to purchase their own flats. HDB, however, does exercise flexibility to allow Singapore citizen families with household incomes that slightly exceed the $800 ceiling to also rent flats.

Pilgrim brokers help intending pilgrims to register with MUIS for the haj, provide training on haj rituals and look after their welfare in Saudi Arabia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS also selects General Sales Agents (GSAs) who provide haj packages at competitive prices. The haj packages include board, lodging and internal travel in Saudi Arabia. Only those GSAs who are able to satisfy the conditions imposed by MUIS are selected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this year's haj, MUIS selected 13 pilgrim brokers and seven GSAs. When their appointments were announced, MUIS advised intending pilgrims to deal only with these authorized pilgrim brokers and GSAs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilgrims referred to by Mr Chiam were those who went against MUIS' advice and paid money to a travel agent who was not selected by MUIS as a GSA.

This was higher than the 60% single male Singaporeans, aged 20 and above and with at least secondary education, in our entire population.

Cleansing contractors can recruit foreign workers under this policy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, however, dispel the notion that foreign workers are a simple answer to enable the town councils to maintain cleanliness in public housing estates at lower cost. Foreign workers are subject to the levy which will be $300 per month from 1st August this year. They will also have to be provided with accommodation. In comparison, some local cleansing workers are paid only $8 to $12 per day for work from about 7.00 am to about noon. This works out to $240 to $360 per month if they work every day in the month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides such low pay, the cleaners also have to work harder as they are expected to service more HDB flats per worker. This is partly because of the labour shortage and partly because contractors tend to cut corners to win the cleaning contracts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability of workers is only one aspect of the problem and it hinges on the pay level as there are still some lowly educated, older Singaporeans who are willing to do such jobs. Two other aspects are, firstly, contract specifications, and secondly, proper supervision to ensure that cleanliness standards are met. There must also be increase in productivity through mechanisation and better work methods. Otherwise, higher manning levels must result in higher cost to the residents even if there is greater access to foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher conservancy costs are inevitable with our manpower constraint and rising income levels. To keep conservancy fees \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> down, HDB residents must learn not to litter. For example, I have been told that certain HDB blocks are reasonably clean in the morning after the cleaners have done their jobs. However, they are badly littered by the time the residents return from work. Besides keep-clean campaigns, there has to be stronger enforcement against littering. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Eunos GRC):</b> I agree with the answer given by the Minister but I would like to ask the Minister whether, in his view, to allow 1,000 foreign workers as cleaners in HDB estates, it is less important than allowing 100 foreign workers in, say, the construction industry or the electronics industry which will benefit only a few companies. Going by the answer given by the Minister, he seems to imply that automation and higher conservancy charges may be the answer. But in practice the tight labour market situation has resulted in many Singaporeans not prepared to take up jobs as cleaners even in spite of higher pay because of the poor working environment. Would the Minister also consider relaxing perhaps the quota on engagement of cleaners by cleaning contractors? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, the thrust of my answer is that the labour shortage is only one aspect of the problem and I think the Member agrees with me. So I hope that Members in their role as town councillors will look at the wider perspective and not just the labour shortage alone because the labour shortage depends also on other factors, for example, the pay levels. If there are many cases where the contractors are in fact paying this level as I have quoted, then obviously they cannot get many workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other factor is that I do not know whether the contracts are clearly spelling out the kind of standards you expect - how many workers per block, and whether the managing agents in fact supervise closely. These are the other factors. And I think the councillors should also consider enforcement against littering. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If despite all these measures, there have to be more foreign workers, then my Ministry will look into it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Safety standards)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. \n  <b>Mr Loh Meng See</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what steps are being taken to ensure that consumers are protected from faulty electrical products or from poorly manufactured electrical goods that do not meet safety standards. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Mah Bow Tan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is currently a list of items that must be tested to meet specified safety standards before they are allowed onto the market.

Multi-racial harmony and tolerance are fundamental in a multi-racial society like Singapore. It is important, indeed vital, that all our children and indeed all our people should learn to get on well with one another, to respect one another's traditions and practices and to accommodate these traditions and practices where necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children who study in a multi-racial school naturally have the most opportunity to mix and interact with children of other races, thereby developing an understanding and appreciation of the values, cultures and sensitivities of the various racial groups in Singapore. In the SAP schools, the students are almost exclusively Chinese and opportunities for interaction with students of other races are obviously fewer than in a multi-racial school. This does not mean, however, that the students in our SAP schools cannot mix and interact easily with children of other races or develop an understanding of the need for multi-racial harmony and tolerance in our multi-racial society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall explain later the reasons why I have arrived at this conclusion, but let me first remind Members on why the SAP schools were set up in 1979. The SAP schools were set up for two purposes: \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To encourage a number of our academically able and linguistically talented students to study both Chinese and English at first language level; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To preserve and keep alive the traditions and ethos of the old Chinese schools in a number of our best schools in order to provide a conducive environment for the learning of Chinese Language and Chinese culture. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the Chinese Language and culture will be kept alive and healthy in Singapore, in spite of the continuing and daily onslaught of Western influences through the media, it is necessary to have a core of able students who are proficient in English and Chinese and who are steeped in Chinese culture and values. These students will be our writers, newspaper reporters and editors, TV producers and personnel and teachers in the future. Knowing CL1, they will help to transmit Chinese culture to future generations of Chinese Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I met with the principals of the eight SAP schools and Chinese High School on 4th July to discuss whether the present mode of operation of the SAP schools had the effect of hindering their students from developing an understanding and appreciation of the need for multi-racial harmony and tolerance in our multi-racial society and whether they felt that changes were needed to the present mode of operation of the SAP schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the views of the principals are summed up in a letter which was sent to me after the meeting. I would like to quote from the letter. It is dated 10th July 1990, and it says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dear Minister, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We refer to the meeting with you on July 4 concerning whether the present mode of operation of the SAP schools will lead to a lack of understanding and appreciation among our students of the values, cultures and sensitivities of the various racial groups in our multi-racial society and whether it is necessary to make any changes to the present mode of operation of the SAP schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our views can be summarised as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) While the SAP schools aimed to preserve and keep alive the traditions and ethos of the old Chinese schools, they are different from the old Chinese schools in that, in the SAP schools, the students learn both English and Chinese at first language level \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> whereas, in the old Chinese schools, the students learn CL1 and EL2. As the students in the SAP schools are fluent in English, in addition to Chinese, this enables the students to mix easily with students from other schools in inter-school ECA activities; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) In our school programmes and activities, there are many opportunities for the SAP schools to bring home to our students the importance of multi-racial harmony and tolerance in a multi-racial society like Singapore. Events such as celebrations of major festivals, exhibitions of cultural artifacts, talks on customs and religions of the three main racial groups in Singapore figure prominently in the activities of our schools; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The majority of our students go on to junior college for their Pre-University education. These students have shown that they have the ability to mix and relate well with their counterparts from non-SAP schools as well as students of other ethnic groups. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, we are of the opinion, while we should continue to monitor the situation closely, there is no pressing need to make major changes to the mode of operation of the SAP schools at the present time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We thank you for the opportunity to make our views known to you on this very important matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours sincerely, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signed \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals of Anglican High School, Chung Cheng High School, Catholic High School, Maris Stella High School, St. Nicholas Girls' School, Nanyang Girls' High School, The Chinese High School, Dunman High School and River Valley High School.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to the principals of our SAP schools and Chinese High School, I also met with the principals of our junior colleges to discuss this subject. The junior college principals confirmed the point made by the principals of the SAP schools that, in the junior colleges, the SAP students interact and mix freely and comfortably with students of other ethnic groups as well as students from non-SAP schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have confidence in the judgment of our principals. They meet with the students daily. They, together with their teachers, are the people who know the students best. They are in the best position to assess whether the present mode of operation of the SAP schools hinders their students from developing an understanding and appreciation of the values, cultures and sensitivities of the various racial groups in our multi-racial society and should therefore be changed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the principals suggest, the Ministry will keep the situation under close review. We will help the SAP schools to create more opportunities for their students to mix and interact with students of other schools, for example, by twinning the SAP schools with suitable multi-racial Government or Government-aided schools, as has been suggested by Dr Tan Cheng Bock. Overall, Sir, I agree with the principals that there is no pressing need to make major changes to the mode of operation of the SAP schools at the present time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will always welcome suggestions from Members as to how we can further help students in our schools, including the students in the SAP schools, to understand the need for multi-racial harmony and tolerance in our multi-racial society and to develop an appreciation of the values, cultures and sensitivities of the various racial groups in Singapore. In this connection, the Ministry is working out ways to increase the number of schools which will teach Malay and Tamil as a second language in addition to Chinese during school time in the schools. This will ensure that access to our schools, particularly the popular schools, will be open to children of all races provided that they meet the required standards. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to another point which has been raised in the Press, ie, that as the SAP schools enjoy special resources not available to other schools and as they teach only EL1 and CL1, thereby attracting almost exclusively Chinese children, this is not fair to non-Chinese children who do not have the opportunity or who may not have the inclination to study in the SAP schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's position on this point is very clear. I have stated on more than one occasion that we take an even-handed attitude towards children of all races in our education system. We will ensure that no child in Singapore is discriminated against simply because of his race. Pupils who are eligible and who wish to study ML1 or TL1 can already do so at the Ministry of Education's Language Centres. Furthermore, just as we have established the SAP schools to enable Chinese children to learn EL1 and CL1, we will establish similar schools to enable Malay and Indian children to learn \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> EL1 and ML1 and EL1 and TL1 respectively if there is demand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Sir, the SAP schools are a valuable part of our education system in Singapore. The SAP schools fulfil a need to nurture a core of students who are fluent in English and Chinese at first language level and who will be the transmitters of Chinese culture to future generations of Chinese Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will continue to keep the situation under close review and increase opportunities for students in SAP schools to integrate and mix with children of other schools but there is no pressing need to make major changes to the mode of operation of the SAP schools at the present time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Ministry will continue to maintain an even-handed attitude towards children of all races in our education system. Just as we have made special provision for Chinese children to study EL1 and CL1, we will make similar provision for Malay and Indian children to study EL1 and ML1 and EL1 and TL1 if there is demand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I understand that some Members may like to debate my statement, following precedent, I propose to move an adjournment of the House to enable Members to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>DEBATE ON MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I move adjournment of the House, may I seek your consent and the general assent of Members present to move that the debate on my Ministerial Statement be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order 1 (8) (b)? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I give my consent.

Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Cheng San GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to thank the Minister for Education for his statement on the subject of SAP schools. Since the subject was discussed in this House during the debate on the Presidential Address, there has been much discussion on this subject, both inside and outside this House. It is my firm belief that one key area to preserving and enhancing racial harmony and social cohesion must definitely lie in our educational system. It is through our young that we can ensure the maintenance of racial harmony. Towards this end, I welcome the Minister's statement on this subject. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the last debate I raised three specific issues. Firstly, for administrative convenience, a good number of schools have streamed their pupils according to second language taken. I believe this has unwittingly contributed to racial segregation. It is necessary for the Ministry of Education to instruct all schools to discontinue this practice. Pupils in our schools must be streamed according to academic merit and not by choice of second language. I believe if this is done there will be greater interaction amongst the students. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I referred to was the question of some good schools, ie, the popular or better schools, discouraging children enroling in their schools because a particular second language will not be available during curriculum time. I am extremely gratified by the Minister's statement that the Ministry will now try to offer ML2 and TL2 in the better schools during curriculum time. This change will definitely make it easier, particularly for the Malay and Indian children to enrol in the better schools in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third concern which I raised, and the Minister has addressed it, is my concern with SAP schools. Here I would like to again congratulate the Minister for taking the trouble to discuss this question in detail with the principals of SAP schools and the heads of junior colleges. I can understand the views of the principals of the SAP schools because they cannot say anything else. I took great pains during this earlier debate to explain that I supported the principle behind SAP schools. I asked for a review in the implementation of the SAP programme in the context of promotion of inter-racial harmony. The Minister, the principals of SAP schools and heads of junior colleges are satisfied that there are enough opportunities for children in SAP schools to mix with children of other races, and that there is no cause for concern. This is their point of view and I respect it, except that I am personally not as optimistic as they are. I sincerely hope that they are all right. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I am personally very heartened to note that the Minister has stated that his Ministry will monitor the situation closely and also look at additional ways and means for students in SAP schools to interact with other children in other schools. This, I believe, is a good starting point and this is something we should actively pursue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I personally do not think it is necessary to take up the Minister's offer to set up SAP schools for students studying Malay and Tamil. This will only aggravate the problem further. To me, what is most important is that all our students, especially the brighter ones, must have opportunities to interact freely and experience similar environments. I would urge the Minister, and particularly his Ministry officials, to apply themselves further to find ways and means to achieve this. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, sometimes in our eagerness to preserve certain values and traditions, in this case the SAP schools, we may create some problems or concern. In this case, the SAP schools were seen as institutions not in line with what we are attempt- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ing to achieve, ie, a multi-racial Singapore. Sometimes these concerns are not so evident now but may be so in the future. Therefore, as responsible MPs, we should bring this to the attention of this House and, if possible, come out with solutions that will help to allay the fears, in this case, of the minority races in Singapore. That is why after meeting many Singaporeans expressing concerns about SAP schools, I suggested the twinning of schools. And if I could refer you to the Budget debate on 16th March 1990, I said that the twinning of schools should allow the schools involved to develop programmes in the non-academic areas. For a start, like games, having a common rugby team with players from both schools, common football team or netball team and also common cadet or scout groups. If such programmes work out well, then we could extend to other areas. The sharing of academic teaching methods could be explored. Of course, these schools should preferably be sited close to each other and more details can be worked out with the Ministry and I am available if the Ministry needs me to make suggestions. We can work it out. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the Minister for looking into this matter very seriously and for having met the principals of the various schools, and I am very grateful. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Encik Yatiman Yusof)</b>(\n  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the Hon. Minister for Education for having reiterated, clearly, the Government's stand with regard to SAP schools. In particular, I would like to thank him for his assurance that if the other communities want a similar scheme, his Ministry would certainly look into it. He said this is the logical approach to be taken by a Government that continues to believe in multi-racialism as a pillar of its policies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, why the concern about the undesirable side-effects of the SAP scheme? Why has this been raised? I think our concern, including the concerns voiced by the Members for Cheng San GRC and Ayer Rajah, has reopened the debate on this issue and, indeed, these concerns are valid. Firstly, the scheme involves Chinese students from pre-school \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> age going through the critical years of their emotional, intellectual and social development. The lack of exposure to the climate and realities of a multi-racial society in SAP students can to some extent influence their intellectual make-up and social attitudes. To my mind, the question of social attitude is most crucial to the future of multi-racialism in our country. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the second concern. Mr Speaker, the students studying in the SAP schools generally comprise those who are able to take CL1. Naturally, these would be bright students with the potential to lead the society in future. Would these graduates of the SAP schools have a positive social awareness and a positive attitude towards multi-racialism? According to the Hon. Minister, the discussion he had with the SAP school principals assured him that these concerns should not exist, that SAP students are in fact able to interact with non-SAP students. But did these principals express their views objectively? The Member for Cheng San GRC doubts if they did, and I feel the same way. For, they are directly involved in the scheme and obviously must have full confidence in it. Perhaps the views of the junior college principals, who have seen how SAP graduates interact with other students, would be more objective. But is their involvement in the various programmes run by the junior colleges a sufficient indication? That is still a question, particularly in the analysis of their social attitude and views. Observing their actions in other situations, for example, during recess or in their mixing outside school hours, or listening to their views on issues relating to multi-racialism in a frank and open atmosphere might perhaps give us different indications. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have nothing against the SAP scheme. If this is deemed to be the way towards tackling certain problems faced by the Chinese community of Singapore, ie, the erosion of their culture and proficiency in Mandarin, I think it is only proper that it should be implemented. However, while we seek to resolve one problem, we have to be sensitive to other issues that might arise therefrom. I therefore welcome the position taken by the Minister for Education when he said that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Ministry would monitor the implementation of the scheme closely. I am confident that, even if he could not accept the Member for Ayer Rajah's proposal to twin SAP and ordinary schools, or the Member for Cheng San GRC's suggestion that elements of multi-racialism be consciously incorporated, the Minister would be ready to make adjustments should any negative indications be detected in the scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is the need to stress on multi-racialism and its elements in this issue that I wish to highlight here. If there is any difficulty in ensuring the students' exposure to the ideal multi-racial climate in the development of their social attitudes, it does not mean we ought to maintain the status quo regardless of the views of the other communities. Thus, I would like today to suggest two possibilities. If the Member for Ayer Rajah wants the twinning of SAP schools, I would ask that the Minister consider the possibility of placing SAP schools under a \"one school three wings\" or \"one school three branches\" concept if the Malays and Indians want such school. This idea would mean our students are exposed to an environment with three components. During curriculum hours, they would take lessons meant to impart cultural elements and values but, in the afternoon, during ECA, pupils of all ethnic backgrounds would play and interact with one another. If this is not possible, I would still urge that special subjects dealing with social views and attitudes be offered to SAP students, with emphasis on multi-racialism. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I make this proposal, I would like to take the opportunity to comment on the points made by an academic who said, inter alia, when he wrote about the SAP schools, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' . . . non-Chinese parents in general are made to feel deprived [ie, of their right] in not being able to send their bright children to schools similar to such schools [ie, SAP schools].' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not clear what Dr Hussin Mutalib meant when he made this statement, published in the Straits Times of 23rd June. If what he meant to say by \"deprived\" is that there is a plea for the same opportunity to be provided to Malay students, that is to establish SAP schools specially for Malay \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> students, he should first of all ask whether Malays face the same problems as the Chinese and want the same solution. Mr Speaker, I am not sure that Malays face the same problem, that is, the rapid erosion of cultural values and the need to build a single community speaking one language and not different dialects, as is faced by Singaporeans of Chinese descent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Malays have overcome the dialect problem and Malay is now universally used within the community. I do not know about future generations, of course. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the performance of Malay students in Malay language is satisfactory. This is partly owing to the strong environment that exists for the study of Malay at home. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the number of Malay students taking Malay as a first language, or ML1, is stable. From a total of 322 students taking ML1, 90 of them are in Secondary 1, 81 in Secondary 2, 84 in Secondary 3 and 67 are now in Secondary 4. These figures are the result of a conscious choice made by parents. The problem actually faced by Malay students is in attaining a high level of performance in English, Mathematics and Science. Creating a SAP school specially for Malay students might strengthen the Malay language and enhance awareness of Malay culture but I am not sure if it would not jeorpadize their performance in English. Parents would rather see their bright children studying and succeeding in good schools than in some special school. And for this reason, I welcome the Government's move to introduce ML2 in schools which hitherto did not offer the subject. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, another no less important aspect is the desire of the Malays to enter the national mainstream and to be a part of our multi-racial society. The right climate for this exists in schools with a multi-racial student population. These two elements are at the heart of our national objectives and I would appreciate it if the Minister could take them into consideration. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to make two short points on the Hon. Minister's statement. First, on the SAP school and the second, a more general point, on the offering of second language by schools generally. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the SAP scheme, I think there is a concern, and I would say a legitimate concern, that a proportion of the brightest children in Singapore may go through 10 formative years without the close interaction with the children of other races. I hear what the Minister says, but I think it has to be accepted that the more time children spend with children of other races or the more time children spend in a multi-racial environment, the greater the empathy will be towards multi-racialism. The empathy factor may be directly proportional to the time spent and, in the context of Singapore, that is an important point. Such close interaction is available in all schools generally. The concern is that it may not be as easily available in the SAP schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I support the SAP scheme, perhaps we could consider one idea. I do not think that it is necessary to set up a separate SAP school for children of other races, but perhaps a multi-racial environment could be created in the existing SAP schools with ML1 and TL1 being offered by the same schools. This would provide a physical environment where children of all races come together but they study the different languages at a higher degree. Perhaps this is just one thought. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I wish to make is the offering of second language in schools. Generally, I am glad to know the Minister's commitment to make as many schools as possible, and in particular the popular schools, to offer all second languages, or at least the three major second languages. As a matter of implementation though, one point has to be noted. Many good schools now in theory offer all three second languages. But in practice, what happens is that they say they will only offer all three languages provided there are sufficient numbers of students. Popular schools will have a large number of applicants and by the system of selection, students of any particular race \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> may fall below the required minimum in order for the school to opt for the particular second language within their curriculum time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that it would be illogical to require every school to employ a Tamil or Malay teacher, regardless of how small the number of students is. But I think there are ways around it. Perhaps a few such schools could come together and employ one teacher who could move round the schools. But there may be some administrative problems about time tables and so on. Henry Park School is an example of a school which, for some years, in theory, offered Tamil, but in practice did not, because there were never enough Tamil students to take it. If our education system is moving towards the Japanese system, then what we have is that you need to get to a good primary school in order to get to a good secondary school, and you need to get to a good secondary school in order to get to university. And if we accept meritocracy as the only principle, then regardless of race, all children of all races should have theoretical as well as practical access to all good schools. That is the point I wish to make, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I give full support to the Minister. On this issue, I am behind him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last sitting, I pointed out that SAP students do have opportunities to mix through school sports day, uniformed group activities and ECA; secondly, these students also have opportunities to mix in housing estates; and thirdly, when they go to junior colleges, university and in National Service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of inter-racial mixing, there are two basic questions. First, do SAP students have an opportunity to mix? Can they mix? And do they mix? The answers are all yes and in the affirmative. The Minister just now gave us the assessment of the principals from the nine SAP schools and also of the JCs. This confirms my point that the SAP students do mix, can mix, and they do have opportunities to mix. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I add another point: In the university and polytechnics, students of different \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> racial groups do mix, and you cannot tell among the Chinese students who were from the SAP schools and who were from the non-SAP schools. So we must judge the system by its products. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is a comparative question. In comparison with students of other schools, do SAP students have fewer opportunities to mix with students of other racial groups? The Minister thinks so, as there are very few non-Chinese students in SAP schools. This is an obvious point. But may I counter this point by asking a simple multiple-choice question. Which of the following has a greater opportunity to mix? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) An ACS boy living in a private housing estate; or \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A River Valley High School boy living in an HDB flat? \n  <br>\n  <br>The answer is not straightforward. It depends on many factors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question simply highlights one particular important point, that is, living or residential environment is an equally important factor, in addition to school environment. So we must look at this question of inter-racial mixing in a wider perspective. In an open, urbanised and highly competitive society like ours, it is not possible for any group to isolate itself from the others and neither is it desirable to do so. Even the Japanese in Singapore cannot do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the point made by Dr Tan Cheng Bock and Mr Chandra Das. I never question their motives. But when Dr Hussin Mutalib chose to echo Mr Chandra Das' point in the Straits Times, the debate on SAP schools has taken on a different dimension, ie, a broader dimension. Dr Hussin made two main points. One point is that the SAP system operates in such a way that it prevents inter-racial mixing amongst students. I am not sure whether his point is identical with or similar to Mr Chandra Das' point. But he made another point, and that is, may I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... non-Chinese parents in general are made to feel deprived in not being able to send their bright children to such schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilising taxpayers' money, the SAP schools offer infrastructural facilities on a scale not enjoyed by ordinary schools ... .' \n  <br>\n  <br>He went on to say: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Given the requirement that students who wish to apply for these elite schools must also offer ...(CL1), non-Chinese students of equal merit are denied access to study in SAP schools if they do not take CL1.' \n  <br>\n  <br>This is from the Straits Times of 23rd June. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Hussin's letter has drawn sharp reactions and strong rebuttals from readers in both Chinese and English newspapers. He should realise that in a multi-racial and multi-religious society, if he started to query the use of taxpayers' money for SAP schools, then he cannot prevent others from asking whether or not taxpayers' money has been used to fund or support any institution or activity for the exclusive use or benefit of one particular community. And what purpose does it serve? Where will this line of argument and counter-argument lead us to? Will this type of argument undermine the basic principle of racial harmony that we are trying to preserve or maintain? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of equal access of SAP schools, let us not forget the objectives of SAP schools, and the Minister has mentioned them. Let me reiterate them: (a) to teach EL1 and CL1; and (b) to preserve the tradition and ethos of Chinese schools. I have said in this House the last time that if non-Chinese parents are prepared to send their children to SAP schools, I believe SAP schools will welcome that. Of course, these non-Chinese students must be of equal merit and meet the requirements. Every institution has its own requirements. NUS has its requirements in terms of \"A\" level results, subject combination and language requirement. You cannot say, \"I want to join your church, but you change your bible.\" Moreover, the Minister has repeated his offer. If there is a demand for Malay and Indian students to learn ML1 or TL1, the Ministry of Education will make the necessary arrangements to make this possible. This is an equal treatment and fair to all communities. Whether or not it is necessary to have a Malay SAP school or Tamil SAP school is another question. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, may I just make a point about the SAP students. They are effectively bilingual, and in that sense they are able to combine the East with the West and it is more likely they will develop a balanced view. And secondly, if they really learn the core values of Chinese teaching derived from Confucianist ethics and Buddhism, to some extent, then they will be more tolerant and more respectful of other cultures and religions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the statement of the Minister for Education. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my view that bilingual education, especially the SAP scheme, is a correct and very important policy. We must not only proceed with this scheme but we must also go one step further to improve and strengthen it. Economic development and racial harmony are two requirements that Singapore must have. And because of this, Singaporeans have to use English as a first language. But if the Government does not stress and make efforts to implement the bilingual policy, then eventually Singaporeans will pay more and more attention to English and slowly forget about their own mother tongue and eventually we will lose our cultural heritage and traditional values. In this kind of society, it is not sound and healthy, because the people in such a society will be culturally rootless. Although we may be able to continue to enjoy the present prosperity, when we face a grave crisis, we will become directionless. We will not know what to do, we will lose our ballast, and we will lose our cohesion and strength to face the difficulties and problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you one example. When I was young, I read the stories about the Spring and Autumn Warring States. There was this King of the State of Yue. After a defeat, he spent 10 years reliving the problem, building up himself, going through the difficulties and hardship. I also read about Yue Fei, a hero of the Sung Dynasty, for his patriotism. This kind of story has left a very deep impression in my mind, and each time I come across any setback, I derive encouragement and inspiration from such stories. So I can appreciate the Prime Minister's narration of his experience of having been slapped by a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Japanese, and from there he made the determination to build his own nation. This gives me a very good lesson. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set up the SAP schools to provide the opportunity for students with the interest, inclination and capability to learn their mother tongue as the first language so that we will have a group of students with such linguistic ability to transmit our cultural heritage and to promote literary appreciation in their mother tongue. This cannot be done by Singaporeans generally because they have to cope with the need of learning and using English. So we need such people to take the lead to ensure the continuation of our cultural heritage and the transmittal of such values. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, successful implementation of the SAP scheme is not an easy task. Since its implementation in 1979, whether we have achieved the objective or not, it is still too early to say. According to my knowledge, although 10% of the PSLE students are eligible to go into the SAP schools, only 5% of them select to go into SAP schools. I believe one of the reasons is that the SAP school lacks a certain very important link and, as a result, we do not achieve the desired effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because if we want students to build a strong foundation for a language and to cultivate their interest in the language, we cannot wait until they reach the secondary school. We should start right from the primary school, right from a young age of the students. In my opinion, the SAP schools should not only be continued but they should also be improved and strengthened. And because of this, the Government has decided to set up what they call the \"seed\" schools. This is a very wise move. I hope that this move will not cause any concern or worry to certain people over the so-called segregation of SAP school students from students of other races. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister has already explained why there is no problem to the maintenance of religious harmony in Singapore. I entirely agree with what he has said. As a matter of fact, what is more important is the correct attitude among the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> various ethnic groups towards one another. Correct attitude must be cultivated right from childhood, right from young. We must teach our students not to have any discrimination or suspicion of other ethnic groups. We must cultivate the idea of universal brotherhood among our students. This I think we have already done. Because if you look carefully at the contents of the Civics lesson in our primary schools, you will see that there are many lessons inculcating the concepts of multi-racialism and multi-racial harmony. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, under our old education system, we have the so-called Chinese schools and the English schools. There are many Singaporeans who have hailed from the Chinese schools. Why is it that since the 1970s we were able all the time to work and live and make progress together in racial harmony? This is because, as the Minister has stated, the Government is determined to support and maintain racial harmony. The various policies of the Government, including the policy of putting various ethnic groups in the same housing estate to ensure that all racial ethnic groups will have the awareness of maintaining racial harmony, are very important. This is the most important reason of our having racial harmony. Thank you, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I express a personal view on this subject? I have seen several different parts of our school system. I went to primary school in Nanyang Primary School. It is what would nowadays be called a SAP school, purely a Chinese environment. I went to secondary school in Catholic High School, also a Chinese environment but different, because it is a mission school. We had Catholic brothers and quite a number of Indian teachers, teaching not only English but also Science and other subjects. We also had activities with other schools nearby, especially our brother schools, St. Joseph's, RI, etc., and therefore opportunity to mix with kids from other backgrounds and traditions. I spent a year in National Junior College, where students and teachers came together from all the schools in Singapore - English schools, Chinese schools, Malay kids, Indian kids, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Eurasians - attending lectures together, sports, games, together. And plus on top of that, for several years as a kid, I was a member of a wolf cub pack in Kampong Jagoh Primary School, most of whose members were Malay kids because Kampong Jagoh in those days was a Malay neighbourhood. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I learnt something from each one of these experiences, I would have been the poorer off if I had not undergone them. We do not have a single monolithic homogeneous school system in Singapore, just as we do not have a single homogeneous population in Singapore. There are variations in the traditions, in the ethos of different schools, in the values which are emphasised and the character traits which are brought out amongst the children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a common ground. We all say the National Pledge, we all sing the National Anthem. We all must remember that we are citizens of Singapore together. But in the details of moulding the characters of the kids, each school goes its separate way. And I think it is good that we do not all grow up exactly in the same mould, but are a range of individuals with common ideals and common objectives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raffles Institution is a very good school. They have just celebrated a grand dinner last night; many RI boys have been successful Singaporeans. But I do not think we would like all Singaporeans to be like RI boys. ACS is also a very good school, having produced many very successful Singaporeans, but in a different mould. Again we appreciate their contribution to this tradition but I do not think it would be ideal for every Singaporean to be an ACS boy. Similarly with the Chinese schools, whether it is Hua Zhong or Nan Zhong or Gong Jiao. The Chinese schools were one strand of a national tradition, and had their value. I do not know if it is the language in which the lessons are taught, and values are transmitted, or whether it is the way the teachers carry themselves and dedicate themselves to the task of bringing up the kids. But certainly the atmosphere in a Chinese school is different from the atmosphere in an English school, and I am \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> talking about good schools in both cases. In a Chinese school, the teacher goes in, the class monitor says, qi li, stand up, xing li, you bow, zuo xia, sit down. Everybody bows, including the teacher. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be a ritual not so different from English school kids chanting \"Good morning, Sir\", but it is a ritual with some meaning and some influence on the way the kid grows up. If you look at the cut of adult Singaporeans today who have been to Chinese schools, and those who have been to RI or ACS, I think you can distinguish in the adult person the imprint of the formative experiences which he went through. We would be poorer off without any one of these three traditions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not starting from scratch in setting up SAP schools. We are trying to preserve an existing tradition which developed over the colonial period, and gradually eroded somewhat as we went into the national stream schools. Now we are saying let us not go all the way into a single national stream. Let us preserve some of the values of the best components of the earlier tradition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know what the outcome will be in a way because, as the Minister for Education said, a SAP school is not the same as an old Chinese school. You are learning both EL1 and CL1. There is mixture with other students. The activities organised by the schools, the principals, are not the same. It should, by all accounts, be an improvement on what we had before. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look around in society today, there are many honourable Singaporeans who can say that they have had a good upbringing in the old Chinese schools. So is it wise to let that tradition totally die away, whether by neglect or by policy, by bringing everybody together and say, \"No, I will not allow you to have something different because we want everybody to be exactly the same.\"? Even if you look in this Chamber, many of the MPs have come from Chinese schools - Mr Ong Teng Cheong, from Chung Cheng Primary School and Hua Zhong. Many of the Backbenchers were from Chinese schools. Many of the Malay MPs also have received Malay stream education, at least in the primary school level. We are not the same, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> but at the same time are we not able to work together as Singaporeans with a common cause? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a basic question. To be Singaporeans together, do we have to be identical? In talking about integration, do we have to go all the way? If we were totally segregated, that would be very bad. All the Malays on one side, all the Indians on another side, all the Chinese on the third, and the three never mix, exchange views or just work together. That is a recipe for disaster. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if you forcibly stir everybody together, that may not be a good solution either. In America, they have tried this with busing. Some schools were more white, and some schools were more black or more Spanish. By law and compulsion, they mixed the students together so that each school had an equal proportion of all the races. If necessary, they bussed the children, ie, put them into school buses and transport them to some other place so that the proportions will be equalised. It has not led to happy results. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as we make our own efforts at integration, we also have to allow a certain range of activities. This is the way our policies have been pursued. We talk about integrating HDB estates, integrating so that all the neighbourhoods have a representative racial mixture. But we did not specify a fixed mix, exactly 70% Chinese, 15% Malays, so many per cent Indians, so many per cent Eurasians. We specified a range, so that an extreme of 95% Chinese is out, an extreme of 50% minorities is also no good, but in between there is some free play. In the blocks too, there is free play. We do not require every fifth household to be a minority. In the integrated neighbourhoods, if you go and take a look, all the Malay households are on the lower floors, many of the Chinese households are on the upper floors. Should we interfere? I do not think so. These are personal preferences which we should respect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of minority activities, an Indian cultural group, a Malay mosque community activity, should we say no, you are not be allowed to do this because it is bringing you away from the mainstream? It would lead to a lot of trouble. We say, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> yes, do this, but at the same time try to do other activities which will bring you into the mainstream and which will give Malay kids, Chinese kids and Indian kids the opportunity to mix, to get to know one another, and to accommodate one another. So that if you are from a Chinese school and you go into an Indian restaurant down Serangoon Road for the first time, and somebody pours the curry from the pail onto your banana leaf, you feel perfectly comfortable and tuck in with your fingers. I think it can be done. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the concerns of the non-Chinese when we talk about SAP schools is that it sounds like more and more Chinese culture is being expanded and emphasised, and is encroaching upon the non-Chinese cultures and traditions in Singapore. I can assure you that that is not the way the Chinese schools or the Chinese teachers look at it. I am not a Chinese teacher, but if you read what they have written about this issue of SAP schools, they feel beleaguered. There is a certain desperate assertion of how important these schools are, and how we must never let them die. It does not say they will take over the world. It says we must never let them die. And they have a point, because even in SAP schools today, the kids are speaking more English than Chinese, despite everything the parents can do, or the teachers can do. The kids often come from professional backgrounds. They speak English at home, they chatter with one another in English. Certainly, they read a lot more in English than they do in Chinese. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what we are looking for is the preservation of some aspects of Chinese culture, just as we should preserve the best aspects of Indian and Malay cultures. It is a bigger problem for the Chinese population than for the Malay or the Indian population. Because quite frankly, the Malay population does not have difficulty with their children learning ML1. A lot of Chinese parents have great difficulty teaching their children CL1. And even Chinese parents who are originally Chinese-educated and who try to start off their kids using Chinese as well as English, when the kid is a little bit slow to learn to speak, and after 15 months still has not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> gone beyond \"papa\" and \"mama\", they take fright and convert to English so that the child will start talking. Malay kids do not have that problem. I am sure Indian kids do not either. So there is a reason to preserve the tradition and I think the SAP schools are one way to do it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will find ways to mix the SAP school kids from other schools with kids from other racial backgrounds. It can be done. It must be done. Dr Tan Cheng Bock has suggested some ways to do this and the Ministry of Education will follow it up. But to say that we are better off without that pillar of our tradition, then we are cutting off one significant leg of a stable tripod and I am not sure that just with the remaining legs the balance will still stand. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to express some of my personal views on this question. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking about how to improve the SAP schools, we should not forget how these schools originally came about. We will remember that since sometime in the past, our education policy has placed more emphasis on the learning of English. As a result, Chinese schools and Chinese school students were decreasing in number. For a time people were afraid that the Chinese schools might be completely phased out. They feared that, if the number of Chinese schools and students should continue to decrease, then it would be difficult to find good Chinese TV and radio news-readers, teachers, newspaper reporters and so on in future. Already Mandarin-speaking news-readers had to be imported from Taiwan. They asked, would it end up in a situation where all Chinese teachers, news-readers and reporters would have to come from overseas? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has promoted the so-called \"Speak Mandarin\" campaign. But speaking Mandarin alone without studying the written Chinese text does not improve the situation. People have expressed their fears in the press about the future of the Chinese language. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because of the increasing concern in the community that there might not be a sufficient number of Chinese teachers, reporters and news-readers of good standard, Government had to establish the SAP schools to help repair the damage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately although SAP schools are already functioning, there are still fears among many people that the standard of the Chinese language among these schools is still far from adequate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now is how to maintain and improve the standard of the Chinese language in these SAP schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also remember that the Chinese constitute 76% of the population in Singapore today. However we may try to mix students, we will still have more Chinese students in the SAP schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our Minister for Education has said, the SAP schools are operating satisfactorily today. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said on numerous occasions that I will support correct Government policies though I am a member of the Opposition. I support especially some of the new correct education policies. In this instance it is correct for Government to maintain the present SAP schools. The Minister has consulted the principals of these SAP schools, and they have made their position very clear. We should follow their advice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the concern expressed by certain Members is misguided and unnecessary. In the past, we used to emphasize on equal treatment of the four streams of education. Now we emphasize on a bilingual policy. Government has to make up for past neglects in the education policies in the interests of the people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of inter-racial mixing of students, we must not forget that such mixing is already carried out in many other ways as already mentioned by Dr Ow Chin Hock. There is no need for me to repeat them. There are ample opportunities for mixing in housing estates, public places, sports arena. I feel that it is important to make up for past neglects in certain aspects of our education policy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I am also happy that from the general tenor of the speeches, Members have accepted and agreed with the point that while of course we should continue to monitor the situation very closely, I believe that all Members agree that there is no pressing need to make major changes to the mode of operation of the SAP schools at the present time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will come now to the various points made by Members in the order in which they have been made. But before I do that, I would like to again stress one fundamental point, and that is, our Government's commitment to multi-racial harmony and tolerance as the bedrock of our survival and prosperity in Singapore. As I said, this is fundamental. This cannot be argued and it is important we should ensure that everyone in Singapore, particularly our children, develop an understanding and appreciation of the sensitivities, cultures, customs, religions of the various races in Singapore, learn to accommodate one another, where necessary, and generally learn to live and work with each other. This is to ensure that we continue to have the type of peaceful and prosperous Singapore which we now have. All our comments, whether on SAP schools or on other aspects of our education policy, or indeed of other aspects of Government policy, must always be made with this fundamental point in mind. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I come to the specific points made by the Members. First of all, Mr Chandra Das, on the point that streaming in our schools should be by merit and not by the choice of a second language. I would say that I could not agree with him more that where it is necessary to stream children, it should be done by merit. And as I have said in my Statement, we take an even-handed attitude towards children of all races in our education system and we will ensure that no child is discriminated against simply because of his race. So I will make sure that the Ministry takes his point very much into consideration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dr Tan Cheng Bock's suggestion on the twinning of schools and how this can be done, I have said that we will look into this matter and I can assure him, Sir, that we always welcome his suggestion and his interest in the Ministry. I would be very glad to hear his views and when we come to the practical details, I am sure that he will be able to assist us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Yatiman Yusof has brought up some suggestions, for example, in order to increase inter-racial mixing, we might possibly have a school with three branches - one for Chinese children learning EL and CL, one for Malays and one for Indians, ie, Malays learning EL and ML and Indians learning EL and TL. I believe, Sir, we tried this once. At one time, we had integrated schools with three branches, but it did not work out well. I think that our experience with this type of school shows that it is not a promising approach. But since the Member has raised this point, we will have a look at it again. It may or may not work, but I assure him that his suggestion will not be thrown into the waste paper basket. We will look at it . \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding subjects to be taught in the SAP schools which stress multi-racial harmony, as I said in my Statement, Sir, the principals have said that they do have these subjects. They have talks, they have discussions, they also have non-Chinese teachers teaching in the SAP schools, and I am sure they will give this subject very great importance and they will ensure that their students recognise the importance of multi-racial harmony and tolerance in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shanmugam suggested that possibly we might consider offering ML1 and TL1 in the SAP schools as a means of encouraging inter-racial mixing of children. Sir, I do not believe that this is a good suggestion because the SAP schools were set up, as I have explained in my Statement, for the purpose of preserving the ethos and traditions of the Chinese schools. And for that to happen, it is necessary that English and Chinese be the dominant languages in that school and the school operates in that way. Once you allow ML1 and TL1 to be taught in the SAP schools, I believe, Sir, that the character of the SAP schools will change and they will not meet the objectives for which these schools were established. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to mention here that in fact three of our independent schools - Raffles Institution, Anglo-Chinese School and St. Joseph's Institution - have on their own initiative started to offer not only CL1 but also ML1 and TL1 to those children in their schools whom they think are capable and who would like to study these three languages at first language level. The Ministry is watching their progress very carefully. If they are successful, then perhaps we could consider extending this to other schools. But I think it is something which we should keep in mind. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Shanmugam's suggestion that we should ensure that as many schools as possible will offer Malay and Tamil as second language so as to widen access to schools to children of all races and that this should be done even if there are not many students in a particular school who would like to study Tamil, for example, I have said in my Statement that the Ministry is working out steps to ensure that Malay and Tamil as a second language is taught at many more schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the measures which we are thinking about is to work out a system where we have one Tamil teacher, for example, going round to a few schools to teach TL2. It will involve a little bit of time-tabling problems. But I am sure that this can be worked out with the respective principals and this will make it possible for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> more schools to offer ML and TL as a second language, thereby allowing more access to these schools for Malay and Tamil children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dr Ow Chin Hock's point about inter-racial mixing, as I have said in my Statement, I do not think that we can really deny the fact that in a multi-racial school with Chinese, Malay and Indian students, there must be more opportunities for mixing than in a school where there are only Chinese students. That point to me is quite obvious. I also agree that it is not only in the schools that children mix but also in their housing estates and in their homes in which they live. And I am sure that all of us would welcome more opportunities for our children and our people of all races to mix with one another. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to make one point in passing, Sir, and that is we have to recognise that in Singapore, with the Chinese forming some 75% of the population, Malays and Indians and others forming 25%, it is theoretically possible, for example, for a Chinese to live, study and work in Singapore and only mix with Chinese. It is not possible for a Malay or an Indian to do the same because of the fact that they only form one-quarter of the population. So it is important for the Chinese population to ensure that we create opportunities for our children to interact and mix with children of other races. This is good for us and for Singapore, and I do not think that any Member would quarrel with this point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I have said in my Statement just now, although in the SAP schools there are almost exclusively Chinese children, there are opportunities for these children to mix with students of other schools and of other ethnic races in inter-school activities. There are opportunities within the school for the children to learn about multi-racial harmony and tolerance. And from the evidence which we have, from the views of the principals of the SAP schools and the junior colleges, the SAP students do mix well and comfortably with students of other schools and, therefore, there is no need to change the present mode of operation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen has said that we strengthen the study of Chinese at primary \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> level. I think this has already been done. We have established 10 seed schools at the primary level. We are watching their progress. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, I have covered all the points. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do you want to ask for leave to withdraw your motion? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion, by leave, withdrawn. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>3.12 pm \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONTROLLED PREMISES (SPECIAL PROVISIONS) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act (Chapter 60 of the 1985 Revised Edition)\", \n  <br>\n  <br>presented by the Minister for National Development (Mr S.

The amendment which came into force on 1st October 1984 enabled Muslims in Singapore to voluntarily contribute 50 cents each month to Yayasan MENDAKI through the CPF Board. Yayasan MENDAKI was registered as a society under the Societies Act on 10th October 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 1989, Sir, MENDAKI organised the Singapore Malay-Muslim Development Congress to look into various issues facing the Malay-Muslim community. The Congress endorsed, among other proposals, the expansion of the scope of activities of Yayasan MENDAKI from promoting secular and religious education for Muslim children to promoting the economic, social and cultural conditions of the Muslim community. To pave the way for its enlarged role, the Congress approved the dissolution of the original Yayasan MENDAKI, the society, and the incorporation of a new Yayasan MENDAKI or Council for the development of the Muslim community as a company limited by guarantee under the Companies Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first Yayasan MENDAKI was dissolved on 13th August last year and all its assets, liabilities and activities were transferred to the new Yayasan MENDAKI, the company, which had been incorporated on 28th June 1989. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Yayasan MENDAKI, as defined in section 2 of the Administration of Muslim Law Act, refers to Yayasan MENDAKI, the society. Clause 2(c) of the Bill redefines the term Yayasan MENDAKI to take into account the fact that the body known as Yayasan MENDAKI, the society, has been dissolved and its functions taken over by a body corporate of the same name incorporated under the Companies Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Administration of Muslim Act has to be amended, the opportunity has been taken to amend several other sections of the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 5 to empower the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) to erect any building on any property belonging to it. MUIS has been served notice on three of its wakaf properties to clear all temporary structures and spruce up the areas or redevelop them. If it fails to comply with the notice, the sites are liable to be acquired. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS intends to comply with the notice and redevelop the wakaf properties to avoid acquisition by the authorities. Clause 3 is therefore to give MUIS the power to erect any building on any property vested in, belonging to or acquired by it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment deals with the membership of MUIS. Clause 4 amends section 7 to include a Vice-President to be appointed by the President of Singapore. Sir, I wish to explain that there is a proviso with regard to the inclusion of a Vice-President in the membership of MUIS. A Vice-President will only be appointed if the person appointed as the President of MUIS is also holding other appointments. The rising expectations of the Muslim community on the services to be provided by MUIS make it difficult for the President of MUIS, who is discharging his duties on a part-time basis, to do so effectively without any assistance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if the person appointed as President of MUIS is able to carry out his duties only on a part-time basis, a full-time Vice-President will be appointed to help him. When MUIS has a full-time President, the Vice-President's position will not be filled. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present, Naib Kadis are not appointed on a fixed term. Clause 8 amends section 91(3) to specify a fixed period for the appointment of a Naib Kadi. This will allow the Registrar of Muslim Marriages to periodically review his performance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Act, the Registrar of Muslim Marriages keeps the General Register of Marriages, the General Register of Divorces and the General Register of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Revocation of Divorces. I believe the reason was when the Act was passed in July 1968, the Syariah Court and the Registry of Muslim Marriages were housed in the same building at Fort Canning. Sir, now that the Syariah Court and the Registry of Muslim Marriages are operating from different premises, there is no reason for the Registrar of Muslim Marriages to continue to keep the General Register of Divorces. Certificates of divorce are issued by the Syariah Court and should rightly be kept by the President of the Syariah Court. Clauses 2(a), 2(b) and 10 amend sections 2, 100 and 101 to give effect to these changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one other minor amendment is to allow the Registrar of Muslim Marriages to correct any error of a clerical nature in any entry in any certificate of marriage or certificate of revocation of divorce. Clause 10 amends section 101 to empower him to make these corrections which under the present Act, can only be done with the approval of the President of the Syariah Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 repeals and re-enacts sections 143 and 144, which deal with inspection and search of the Register of Marriages, Register of Divorces and Register of Revocation of Divorces by any person. These consequential amendments are necessary to bring them in line with amendments made to sections 100 and 101 of the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, clause 14 seeks to validate payments made to a company incorporated under the Companies Act under the name of Yayasan MENDAKI which has taken over the functions of the society known by the same name since 13th August 1989. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Ibrahim Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Ibrahim Othman (Bedok GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I support the Administration of Muslim Law (Amendment) Bill. Since the establishment of MUIS, the Muslim community has seen and experienced many changes in the administration of Muslim Law in Singa- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> pore. MUIS has engaged itself in many activities: missionary work, social and welfare activities, religious education, collection of zakat and fitrah and the construction of new-generation mosques. The Muslim community in Singapore is grateful for having benefitted from all these activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with this Amendment Bill, I believe the administration of MUIS, the Syariah Court and the Registry of Muslim Marriages will be further strengthened. This I feel is a very sound move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to deal with two matters here. First, concerning MUIS. Under clause 5 (2), MUIS will have powers to develop buildings on wakaf properties vested in it, and as the Minister-in-charge has just stated, three properties are involved. I fully support this plan. I would like to ask the Minister-in-charge of Muslim affairs what MUIS' development plans are for these wakaf properties. What types of buildings are to be constructed? I would like to suggest that, besides developing residential premises for rent, MUIS should also develop commercial properties to be let out to local businessmen. The rental earnings could be used to assist poor Muslims. MUIS could also consider building hostels meant for Muslim students in need of such facilities. Such hostels can help meet our Muslim students' need for conducive study facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the second point I would like to make concerns the administration of pilgrimage affairs. I note there is no amendment under the Bill in this regard. In view of the trouble that arose this year in pilgrimage affairs, I wonder whether MUIS has any plans to assume control of haj pilgrimage in order to ensure its smooth running. Under the Amendment Bill, MUIS will be having a Vice-President. Can we not give the new office bearer this important task, ie, the administration of pilgrimage affairs, in addition to his other duties of assisting the President of MUIS? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, many believe that it is time MUIS took over completely the running of pilgrimage affairs in the interests of our pilgrims. If MUIS has such plans in mind, it \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> must ensure that pilgrim agents and brokers will not be left out. I think their services are still required by MUIS. What we need now is close cooperation between them and MUIS to ensure the efficient management of the haj pilgrimage. If this cooperation can be maintained, perhaps the parties could consider the possibility of setting up a cooperative to administer pilgrimage affairs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Ibrahim Othman for his support on the amendments. With regard to the development of wakaf properties, it is a little bit premature for me to disclose the details of the development. All I can say is that when the amendments of AMLA are brought into operation, MUIS will examine carefully those properties which have potential for development. MUIS will certainly seek the advice from those in the business on how best to develop these properties to maximise their returns. I will certainly refer Mr Ibrahim Othman's suggestions to MUIS it they develop these properties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ibrahim Othman also suggested that perhaps MUIS should take over the control of pilgrimage affairs arising from the incident where 242 pilgrims were stranded this year. In my reply to Mr Chiam a short while ago, the pilgrims who were stranded this year were those who went against MUIS' advice and paid money to a travel agent who was not selected by MUIS as one of its General Sales Agents (GSAs). Our existing legislations are adequate to take care of those who break the law. At this point of time, there is no necessity for MUIS to take over control of pilgrimage affairs. What we will do is to urge would-be pilgrims to take heed of the advice given by MUIS and register only with those pilgrim brokers and GSAs who are approved by MUIS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Ahmad Mattar]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MAINTENANCE OF RELIGIOUS HARMONY BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.30 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is identical to Bill No. 1/90 which was introduced in the previous session but which lapsed because Parliament was prorogued. I do not intend to give a lengthy statement on the contents of the Bill but if I may briefly recapitulate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale for this Bill is set out in the White Paper on Maintenance of Religious Harmony presented to Parliament on 26th December 1989. And as I have said on that occasion, for a young and small nation like Singapore whose people belong to many different religions, religious harmony is not just a lofty ideal but is vital to our stability and order. It is important for us to ensure that the religious harmony and tolerance we have had over the years is preserved. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill addresses two related problems. First, that followers of different religions must exercise moderation and tolerance and not instigate religious enmity and hatred. The White Paper has set out numerous examples of individuals engaged in acts or making of utterances that are insensitive, hostile or provocative. Secondly, it is important that religion and politics be kept separate because religious leaders are seen to have a special status and their pronouncements will have an emotional effect on their flock. If one religious group enters the political arena, so will others. Inevitably, there must be collision between different religious groups, or between religious groups and Government to the detriment of our nation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of having to resort to more severe measures, such as criminal prosecution or detention under the Internal Security Act, the Bill seeks to put in place a limited mechanism to enable prompt and effective action to defuse potential explosive situations which could endanger our religious harmony. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason I do not propose to restate all the arguments is this Bill is identical, as I have said, to the Bill which was introduced on 15th January 1990, and was fully debated during the Second Reading in February 1990 with some 32 Members in this House taking part. It was referred to a Select Committee comprising you, Mr Speaker, as Chairman, and the following Members: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ahmad Mattar \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Chok Tong \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BG Lee Hsien Loong \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow Chin Hock \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encik Sidek bin Saniff \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BG George Yong-Boon Yeo \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and myself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 69 written representations were received by the Select Committee. The Select Committee had one meeting on 30th March 1990 to make decisions on its course of work and on the representors who should be invited to give oral evidence. However, because Parliament was prorogued on 21st April 1990, the earlier Bill and the proceedings on it lapsed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These proceedings have to be started afresh and this is why the Government has re-introduced this Bill without any amendments or revisions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's intention to get this Bill back to the Select Committee for consideration of the different suggestions which have been made by Members of this House and also by the large number of individuals and organisations who submitted written representations to the previous Select Committee. But we do not want to inconvenience those representors in requiring them to re-submit their written submissions. Therefore, as Members would have seen from the Order Paper, it is my intention to move that all the written submissions received in respect of the previous Bill should be referred to the new Select Committee to be appointed to consider this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, members of the public who have not done so before can still submit \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> their representations on this Bill. This fact will be made clear when the advertisement appears inviting representors to the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that is all I wish to say. Our task is to have the Bill back in the hands of the Select Committee and for it to proceed with its work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and the following Members: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ahmad Mattar \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Chok Tong \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. S.

Used prudently, account holders would find their Medisave funds adequate for their hospitalisation expenses. However, those suffering from major illnesses requiring prolonged hospi- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> talisation may run the risk of rapidly depleting their Medisave funds. They may be left with insufficient funds for their old age hospitalisation expenses as well as that of their family members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has since 1985 been studying how to lessen the financial burden on those suffering from catastrophic illnesses. Officers from my Ministry and the CPF Board have consulted insurance experts and studied the experience of other countries. We also appointed a firm of actuarial consultants to help analyse our hospitalisation data, bill sizes and other data. In formulating the Catastrophic Illness Insurance Scheme, the officers and consultants were guided by three considerations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the scheme must be low cost in order to benefit everyone, especially the low income earners. Secondly, it has to be simple. The public can then easily understand it and it would be easy and inexpensive to operate. Thirdly, the scheme must not encourage over-usage of hospital services. The result of this intensive study and careful consideration is the MediShield Scheme, details of which were announced on 24th February this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Central Provident Fund Act to empower the CPF Board to establish and maintain this Catastrophic Illness Insurance Scheme. The premiums for MediShield have been kept low and highly affordable. The premiums range from as low as $1 a month for those up to the age of 30 years to $8 a month for those aged between 60 and 65 years. Medisave funds can be used to pay the MediShield premium. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the premiums have been kept low and attractive on the assumption that there will be mass participation by the public. This would have been easily achieved by making participation compulsory for the whole population. However, we decided not to adopt this administratively convenient approach. Many employees enjoy varying degrees of medical benefits provided by their employers. They may feel that it would not be necessary to participate in the Catastrophic Illness Insurance Scheme. Also, others may have purchased medical insurance \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> coverage for themselves and their whole family and be adequately insured for all medical conditions. We therefore decided to let the public choose whether or not they wish to participate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable them to make an informed choice we embarked upon an intensive programme of information dissemination. This was done through the mass media, through information booths that were installed in various busy shopping centres and at community centres. The CPF Board also sent information materials on MediShield to all households and to all Medisave account holders. Those who decided not to participate could then easily opt out by just mailing back the Insurance Certificate to the CPF Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to keep the premium low, it is also essential that MediShield does not encourage unnecessary hospitalisation. This is achieved through the imposition of a deductible amount and the concept of co-payment. MediShield cover will begin when the claimable hospital bill exceeds $600 a year for those using Class C wards and $1,000 per year for those using Class B2 and above wards. This represents about 15 days' stay in hospital. MediShield will pay 80% of the claimable hospital bill while the insured will pay the remaining 20%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the age limit for MediShield coverage is currently 65. Many members of the public have requested that this age limit be raised beyond 65. I wish to assure Members that we do intend to do so in the future. As we are venturing into totally new grounds, it is essential that we first gain some experience with this new MediShield Scheme. My Ministry will closely monitor the MediShield usage rates and plan for the extension of the age limit at the earliest opportunity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to inform Members that as a result of the mass communication programme, we have attracted the participation of 1,270,000 Medisave account holders, representing a participation rate of 87%. About 14,500 dependants have also applied for MediShield coverage. I believe the inexpensive premium and the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> attractive range of coverage are important factors that have persuaded most Medisave account holders that it is in their interest to have MediShield coverage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government will continue to improve our already high level of health services. Every Singaporean regardless of his financial status has access to good medical care. Unfortunately, quality hospital services are always expensive to provide. This has been well borne out in every country. In Singapore our well established system of subsidizing certain classes of wards without compromising on the level of medical care allows every Singaporean to choose according to what he or she can afford. The introduction of MediShield will further reduce the financial burden on those who have the misfortune of suffering from serious or prolonged illnesses. It represents another important milestone in the development of our health care system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item under discussion and the remaining items on the Order Paper today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline K. Wong (Tampines GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the GPC has been fully informed of the details of MediShield. We support it and wish it every success. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find the premiums to be low and reasonable. The scheme is going to be run at cost and it covers the major kinds of catastrophic illnesses, ie, heart disease, strokes, kidney failure and cancer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also endorse the universal coverage feature of the scheme with an opting-out provision. The universal coverage is necessary in order to protect the low income groups. Personally, I would have preferred the scheme to be a compulsory \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> one, except for people who have had adequate alternative coverage. As it stands now, the opting-out is very simple. People simply fill in the form and just send it back to the Ministry and he would be taken off the scheme. Of course, on the other hand, if we allow opting-out only for people with alternative coverage, this would bring quite a lot of administrative work to the Ministry. For one thing, for example, you have to keep track of what kinds of alternative coverage people have, approve them, and also make sure that people stay on them. And I think this would give the Ministry more work. Anyway I am glad at least that the initial response to the scheme has been very encouraging, which means that lots of people who should be covered are already covered. It is about 87%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major weakness I see in the scheme, but which the Minister has already pointed out, is that it covers people only up to the age of 65. There has been quite a bit of feedback to the GPC from the senior citizens, some of whom express their views quite strongly. They feel that the society does not appreciate their past contributions by not recognising their needs. After retirement, they are now left out of MediShield. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are glad to hear from the Minister that the Ministry will closely monitor the working of the scheme so that he would consider extending the coverage to beyond age 65 at the earliest opportunity. I do not know whether he would be able to give us any indication now on how many years the scheme would run before he will consider it sufficient time to take a decision on the matter. I think the people should not be asked to wait indefinitely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I want to make is that MediShield can be extended to cover the dependent members of the family. Every effort must be made by the Ministry to publicise the scheme and let people think about extending the coverage to their dependants. At present, if you want to opt in, there is no need to go through a medical examination. The question may arise in future when the Ministry may want to impose a medical examination. What will be the period after which every new member who wants to join, or opt in, will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have to go through this medical examination? This will be an important consideration for people who want to opt in their dependants. Some of them might be young and healthy now, but later on they might want to include them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Minister said it very clearly and correctly that the public must not choose the class of wards indiscriminately, that is, irrespective of the ability to pay, even though MediShie1d now enables them to enjoy additional coverage for catastrophic illness. The MediShield scheme has a deductible as well as a co-insurance element. This is to prevent people from over-using or abusing medical services and prevent people from over-demanding services that will in the end inflate medical costs. But I hope the Minister would realise also that the general public, especially the lower educated ones, are not so well-versed with all these terms (deductible, co-insurance, co-payment) and many people have not taken out any insurance scheme before. They have no experience in these things and they may still be under the illusion that MediShield will pay for everything. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deductible of $600 per year for class C ward patients may seem fair at this moment, but there may still be patients who could not afford to cough up this $600 deductible, even though in the case of catastrophic illness $600 is actually not a very huge amount, considering the length of stay and the cost of treatment. So I hope the Minister could still assure the population that if they cannot afford to come up with this $600 deductible, there are still ways for them to apply for waivers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, MediShield does not cover some forms of catastrophic illness, such as haemophilia or thalassaemia major. The plight and the financial burdens of these patients, no doubt the number is quite small, are enormous, and they should receive some special assistance from the Government. Recently, because of the risk of Aids, the price for manufacturing blood products has shot up tremendously and so the cost of treatment to this kind of patients who need blood transfusions regularly has gone up very sharply. No doubt, no insurance scheme is likely to cover congenital anomalies, just as \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> MediShield does not. Still, we should try every means to help this small number of patients to cope with the financial burden of treating this kind of diseases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with this, I would like to thank the Ministry for coming up with this scheme. We wish it every success. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the MediShield Insurance Scheme had initially met with a very favourable public response when it was first announced. And as already pointed out by Dr Wong, the advantage of the scheme is that those who are included in the scheme do not have to go for a medical examination first. But as some of the details of how the scheme actually operates are made known, the favourable response has also given rise to a lot of disappointment and disillusionment. The reason is not far to seek. A closer study of the scheme quickly reveals that many aspects of the scheme are not so advantageous to the insured person after all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, though low, compared to private schemes of a similar nature, the premiums are not truly low-cost when we bear in mind the poor insurance cover provided by the Schedule of benefits. For those who draw decent salaries and wages and are reasonably well-off, the premiums are of course not high. But for those who earn low wages, have families and live almost from hand to mouth, paying the premiums may cause further hardships. This is especially so for those who are 50 years of age and above and have to pay premiums of $60 and $96 annually. These are the very people who most need Government help. For them the premiums should therefore be cut by half at least. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the claims on MediShield have comparatively low \"maximum claimable amounts\". This means that claims can amount to only a small fraction of the hospital fees that have to be paid by the patient. For example, intensive care unit claims are limited to $140 per day when hospital charges could amount to $300 and $350 per day. Again, for example, outpatient kidney dialysis claims are limited to $50 per day when the Singa- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> pore General Hospital charges are $150 per day, and only $600 per month, when SGH charges would amount to $1,800 per month. Surely, the ceiling for \"maximum claimable amounts\" could be raised higher to help those stricken with catastrophic illnesses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there is the novel, as already mentioned, \"deductible\" item, payable once in any one year, of $1,000 for class B wards and above, and $600 for class C wards, which the patient has to pay before claims can ever be made. Only those on chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and outpatient dialyses do not have to pay these \"deductibles\" of $1,000 and $600. If the period of stay should be short, and the hospital charges amount to less than the \"deductible\" amount, it means that the insured sick will not be able to make any claim whatsoever from MediShield. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is the point of the MediShield insurance? In order to allow MediShield to run away from its responsibility to pay the insured person what should be paid to him when he falls ill? The deductible sum in fact should be scrapped. But if it has to be provided for, it should be substantially reduced to help reduce the amount in the hospital bill which the insured pays, though the amount for some people is only a Medisave paper transfer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we have \"co-insurance\", already mentioned also, of 20% to be paid by the patient. MediShield pays only 80% of the claimable sum after the patient has paid the \"deductible\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with all the road-blocks imposed by the \"maximum claimable amounts\", the \"deductible\" and the \"co-insurance\", what benefits does the insured person finally get? The Government pamphlet says he can claim up to $15,000 a year and $50,000 for a lifetime. This is like \"sketching cakes to assuage hunger\". The Chinese call it Hua bing chong ji (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). But in actual practice, how much does a patient pay from his own pocket, and how much does MediShield pay for him, when he is presented with a hospital bill? That is what really counts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the three examples quoted in the CPF booklet: Your Guide to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> MediShield. For those in class A wards, for first admission, the total hospital bill for a 19-day stay is $8,791. But for the first admission, the insured person, using Medisave or cash, pays $8,127, that is, 92% of the total hospital bill. For a second admission, he pays $4,431 out of $5,727, that is still 77% of the total hospital bill. Such an insurance cover is like no insurance cover at all. Perhaps Government could say that those who are treated in class A wards are those who can afford to pay, and therefore should be made to pay for the full cost of hospital treatment. There may be some logic in that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for those in the B2 wards, the total hospital bill for a 19-day stay is $1,373. For the first admission, the patient pays $1,074, that is, 80%. He pays $244 out of $1,223, that is, 20% only for the second admission. B2 wards are in fact, as we all know, upgraded class C wards. There is no reason why MediShield should make a B2 ward patient pay such a high percentage of his hospital bill. For those in class C wards, for the first admission, the total hospital bill for a 19-day stay is $756. The patient pays $631, that is, 83% of the bill. Only for a second admission does he pay $132 out of $661, that is, 20%. Here again there is hardly any real insurance cover to speak of. There is no reason why he should be made to pay such a high percentage of the hospital bill. If the hospital bill does not exceed the deductible amount of $600 and $1,000, as the case may be, the insured person will not be able to make any claim whatsoever. He will have to foot the whole bill all by himself. He can make a claim only on the amount in excess of the deductible amount. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in spite of MediShield insurance, a person stricken with a catastrophic illness finds that he will have to pay either the whole or the greater part of the hospital bill out of his own pocket through Medisave or by cash. He gets very little benefit from the medical insurance even when he most needs help from Government. So we must ask: what sort of MediShield insurance is this that the insured person has to pay such a high percentage of the hospital bill? Does MediShield really insure the people against serious illness? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that MediShield's first responsibility is not to the insured person, but to MediShield itself, to ensure that it will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure. Moreover, MediShield covers only people who are below 65 years of age, as already been touched on. It does not cover those who are above the age of 65, the very people who are most likely to be stricken with catastrophic illnesses. It operates just like private commercial insurance companies. It operates with the object of sure profit and no loss. Yet, it provides less benefits than private commercial hospital and surgical schemes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a scheme given to me where a person who has to insure himself pays only $70 per year and he gets the full cover for all hospital charges in B2, whatever the amount that is charged. He does not have to pay a single cent. But Government MediShield does not have to operate like a commercial business undertaking. Government has a responsibility to look after the aged and the sick. Therefore, it should ensure that MediShield is a truly low cost medical insurance for the aged, that it truly accepts full responsibility in the care and treatment of those stricken with serious illnesses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of MediShield is very good. Insurance against catastrophic illnesses is especially necessary when people nowadays normally live to well past 70. When medical services have been made more and more expensive by frequent Government increases in fees and charges, now compounded by so-called restructuring of hospitals, and when most people have only small sums in their Medisave accounts, a government that claims to be a good caring government should live up to its duty and responsibility to look after the welfare of the people and especially of the sick and the aged. But it would appear that the PAP Government believes in passing the buck to the people themselves, in making the sick and aged look after themselves, first, through Medisave and now through MediShield and in making the people pay more and more. All this must be changed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic illnesses are infrequent - I understand, that they represent at the very \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> most, 1% of the total population - but those who are stricken with such illnesses, together with their families, especially those in the middle and the lower income groups, will need all the assistance the Government can offer. The present Bill deserves wide support, but the regulations which the Minister may make, especially as regard to age limit, the rates of premiums payable, the conditions under which an insured person is entitled to claim benefits payable, and the actual benefits themselves, must be truly responsive to the needs, hopes and aspirations of the people. We have the funds and the means to care for our sick and aged in a fitting manner. The PAP also speaks of hopes to bring about a gracious society of distinction. The present MediShield scheme as announced should therefore be suitably revised to provide genuine help to those in need. In summary, let me therefore suggest the following: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The age limit for MediShield should be extended from 65 to 70 or even 75. The aged are after all the very people who need MediShield cover. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The categories of serious pre-existing diseases listed on page 5, item 2, of the MediShield booklet, namely, cancer, ischaemic heart disease and so on, only a few of the serious diseases, should not be outside, but inside, the scope of coverage of this scheme. Many people feel that the patients who suffer from these illnesses do need Government MediShield cover under all circumstances even if they should have incurred these illnesses during the 12 months before the commencement of MediShield cover. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The rates of premiums payable should be lowered for those who earn low wages. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The maximum claimable amount should be considerably raised. In addition, the deductibles and co-insurance should be done away with altogether, so that all claims may be suitably and reasonably raised to help those who are in need to pay their hospital bills. Nobody wants to get sick. And to say that deductibles and co-insurance are meant to prevent over-usage is all nonsense. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Government should stop raising fees and charges for medical services periodically in order to ensure that medical services are truly affordable - the Minister likes the word \"affordable\" - for the people. And I would support the Bill full-heartedly if the present scheme already in operation should be revised suitably, if not immediately, then in the very near future. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will first address the serious points raised by Dr Aline Wong before I address the distorted interpretations of Dr Lee Siew-Choh. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Aline Wong had asked how many years would we wait before extending the age limit. We will monitor the data for the first two years and see whether the usage rate is predictable. And if we can make a decision at that time, we will then do it. Otherwise we may have to wait another year or two. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to coverage for dependants, in the information materials given out by the CPF Board on MediShield, the coverage of dependants was highlighted, including a form for the account holder to fill in the dependants' data. I believe most account holders are aware of that avenue but we will still continue to publicise that and hope that more will opt in their dependants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to opting in, in order to keep the scheme low cost and simple, we do not intend to impose a medical examination because the cost of the examination alone may be equivalent to two, three or maybe even four years' worth of premiums. What we would do would be to impose a 2-month grace period before MediShield is activated for that particular individual. MediShield also has the right to inspect the medical records of that patient so that if the administrators find out that actually the treatment is for a disease which was already existing prior to that person opting in, then he will not be covered. We believe in keeping it administratively simple and as low cost to administer as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to her fourth point that the deductible and co-payment may be too high for certain categories of people and that they may not be able to afford them, for that group of people they can still ask \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> for waivers from the hospitals and they would be reviewed on a case by case basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For congenital diseases, whilst insurance companies and insurance schemes do not cover congenital diseases, we have been doing our best to assist those cases on a case by case basis and we will continue to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Dr Lee Siew-Choh's point, Dr Lee does not seem to be able to differentiate between a general medical insurance scheme and a scheme that caters for catastrophic illnesses. A general medical insurance scheme would start payment from the first dollar that is incurred but, of course, those schemes are also extremely expensive. The MediShield scheme starts from a dollar a month which is $12 a year for those up to the age of 30. A general medical insurance scheme would probably require a premium of at least $150-$200 for such a person. So we are talking of entirely different scales of premiums. He wants it cheap. He wants it to cover everything. MediShield is run at cost. It has to cater for that particular group of people, ie, the group of people who are suffering from catastrophic illnesses. And because we are catering for those suffering from catastrophic illnesses, it is important to have the deductible so that the scheme is not paying from the first dollar. Because if the scheme is paying from the first dollar, then the premium cannot be kept at the present low level. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has compared the premium with another scheme run by the private sector. I am not too sure where he is quoting from. But based on the surveys carried out by my Ministry and the CPF Board, we have found out that the premiums from MediShield are between half and a third of comparable premiums imposed by the private insurance companies. Of course, they offer a little bit more. But then if we triple our premium, I think we can offer a lot more than what the private insurance companies are offering. The point is we are trying to ensure that we are keeping the premium as low as possible so that the lower income group can afford it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deductible is equivalent to about 15 days' stay. That means a patient who \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> goes in for, say, 17 days' stay, must cover the first 15 days on his own and MediShield would start from approximately the 16th day onwards. Therefore, for the first hospitalisation which he has quoted from the MediShield pamphlet, of course, the quantum paid by the patient must be high. But as he has also shown, for the subsequent hospitalisations, once it exceeds the deductible amount, he pays only 20% which is the aim of the scheme. This is to alleviate the burden faced by those who require prolonged hospitalisation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also quoted the case of a A class patient where for the first period of stay he pays 92% of the bill and for subsequent stays he pays 77%. Sir, that is intentional, because our reimbursements are pegged to the C and B2 classes. So those who pay low premiums and go to the higher classes of wards cannot expect the lower income group to subsidize them for their stay in A class. Therefore, we have also recomputed their bill to the equivalent of B2 bill, and that is why they end up paying a lot more since they have chosen to go to a higher class ward. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has given us some suggestions, one of which I have already covered, and that is the extension of the age limit. He has also asked for existing illnesses to be covered under the scheme. Sir, if we do that, there is no reason for anybody to want to be insured. Insurance means you share the risk well before you are struck by a disease. If everybody can opt in and be covered for a disease or an illness which they already have discovered, then we will only be covering those who are sick and that is no longer an insurance system. So what he is talking about is totally impossible to be implemented because it is just not a very logical suggestion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked for the rates to be lowered. Sir, MediShield is being operated at cost. We will try to maintain the premium as low and for as long as possible. If we find that the premiums for certain age groups have been over-estimated, there are mechanisms for the premiums to be lowered in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next point is about raising the claimable amounts. Sir, the claimable \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> amounts are more than adequate for the B2 rates. He has talked about the ICU rate of $350. Yes, that is for a person who has gone to a B1 or A class ward. But for a B2 patient the $140 a day is more than adequate to cover his stay in the ICU. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has also managed to jump on to his favourite hobby-horse, which is to tie the issue of medical fees to MediShield and that he will support it if we stop raising medical fees. Sir, that topic has been debated many times before by Dr Lee, but I want to take this opportunity to reply to him again. Sir, Singaporeans generally want a high level of service. Service has to be provided by people. Service does not just appear from thin air. This means we have to pay for our staff. For those who can afford it, the policy is that they pay for what they demand and for what they receive. So A and B1 patients should pay full costs. For those in the lower income group who require assistance, they go into the B2 or C class wards. They pay a very small percentage because our subsidies are very, very high. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As wages increase, the institutions must meet their expenses in two ways. One is in terms of improving efficiency, and secondly, through recovery of costs. For patients in the B2 and C class wards, that recovery of cost is partly met by increased subsidies from the Government. But the remaining portion must be recovered from the patients through fee increases. By adjusting the fees regularly, we will be able to keep these increases to a much smaller level than the recent one. In terms of medical fees, the choice is up to the patient. If you want better service, we need to employ more people, the right calibre of people, and we must pay them, which means costs must go up. The restructured and Government hospitals will eventually offer different level of service. Their manpower establishment will vary from hospital to hospital. Certain hospitals may be able to get by with lesser people, their service may not be as good but it is likely that their fees would also be lower. At the end of the day, Singaporeans will have a choice of not just the different classes of wards but the different hospitals which may provide different levels of services. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Sir, I have no quarrel with the charges for A class. I merely use that as an example to show that the claimable amount is very small. But I think the Government must make clear the distinction between a catastrophic illness and a patient who stays in a hospital for some time. He keeps on stressing how long a person stays. But a catastrophic illness is something which occurs suddenly and it disables that man to a great extent and these are the cases where we hope the Government will be able to help. But apparently the Minister does not seem to think that way. It is very important that we must realise that whether it is B2 or C class, Government must help to make sure that those people who are stricken with such illnesses are given every facility to improve and get on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said that it is impossible to implement some of the suggestions I made. Sir, it is never impossible. I think we have seen enough of TV advertisements about \"Impossible, impossible\". But we must realise that it is all a matter of priorities. If the Minister wants to spend money on \"Swing Singapore\" or on some other things, of course, the money is not there. If he wants to spend all the money on defence and armaments when everybody is cutting down their defence expenditure, of course, the money is not there. But there is plenty of money in our kitty. Why does he not make use of it to help the people instead? He is not doing that. Therefore, the choice is not so much with the patient but with the Government. It is the Government that forces the choice on those people who go to hospital. When they have no money they cannot help but ask for Class C. But when there is no Class C they cannot help but opt for Class B. That is all there is to it. So let us be clear about it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, Dr Lee Siew-Choh does not seem to be able to face realities. Yes, catastrophic illnesses strike a person without warning, just like any other illness, and that is why it is important for all Singaporeans, firstly, to participate in MediShield in case such an eventuality occurs. Secondly, we have been spending a lot of money on health education to tell Singaporeans that they have to keep themselves fit, healthy and try not to fall ill. For \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> those patients who do fall ill and they require help, yes, help is available. Those who can afford it and do not require help, there is no reason why Government should subsidize them. But for patients who require financial help and they go into the B2 and C Class wards, Sir, the help is plentiful. The subsidies for Class C exceed 80%. For those who suffer from a serious illness and who require operation, in the higher tables of operation, there is a cap imposed so that they do not pay more than a certain amount, no matter how serious an operation they require. So the help is available, including complete fee waivers. We do not want to end up as a welfare state. That is fast going out of fashion, but Dr Lee apparently does not seem to appreciate it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Lim Boon Heng) in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment made: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, line 4, after \"shall\", to insert \"be deemed to have\". - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 and 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with an amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>4.30 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March this year, I announced in this House various adjustments to the work- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> men's compensation rates. This Bill seeks to amend the Workmen's Compensation Act to effect these adjustments, which are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) an increase in the compensation for death from the existing range which is $15,000 minimum to $45,000 maximum to the new range which is $26,000 minimum to $78,000 maximum; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) an increase in the compensation for permanent total incapacity from the existing range which is $20,000 minimum to $60,000 maximum to the new range which is $35,000 minimum to $105,000 maximum. (The actual compensation for death or permanent total incapacity depends on the age and salary of the workman at the time of the accident); \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) a revision of the compensation in percentages of loss of earning capacity for thumb, finger and toe injuries; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) removal of the cap of $390 on monthly wage compensation for temporary and permanent incapacity and limiting the maximum period for such payment to one year. Henceforth an injured workman will be entitled to medical leave with full pay of up to 60 days if he is hospitalised and 14 days if he is not hospitalised and thereafter to medical leave at two-thirds of his salary (without the previous cap of $390 per month) up to a maximum of one year medical leave. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjustments in the compensation rates are necessary because of the 73% increase in the median wage of workers since the last revision in 1980. The compensation for thumb, finger and toe injuries have to be revised to correct the anomalies of some of the existing rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now highlight the main clauses in the Bill. Clauses 6 and 7 will provide for the above-mentioned changes. Clause 9 will apply these amendments to accidents which occurred on or after 1st May 1990. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new provision is included in clause 7 to empower the Minister to vary by order the maximum or minimum amount of compensation payable. This provision will enable future changes to the compensation limits to be made expeditiously to keep pace with changes in income levels of workmen. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other minor amendments are proposed to the Act to facilitate its administration and to enhance the penalties for certain offences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill will remove ambiguities concerning how the monthly earnings for a workman who had worked for less than a month should be calculated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 will allow greater flexibility in the reporting of minor accidents. Employers will be allowed to submit monthly summary reports for minor accidents instead of having to report each accident within 10 days. The clause also raises the penalty for not reporting an accident within the prescribed time limit from a fine of $1,000 to $2,000. This is to preserve the punitive effect of the fine, which has not been adjusted for many years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 will increase the fine from $4,000 to $10,000 for an employer who fails to insure himself against the contingent liability of having to pay workmen's compensation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 will empower the Commissioner for Labour to require the attendance of any person to answer questions or produce documents concerning any injured workman. This will facilitate the assessment of compensation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I speak in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is very necessary as the Minister has just said that adjustments in the workmen's compensation rates were last revised in 1980, whereas the median wage of worker has increased by some 73% since 1980. Moreover, in spite of the regular factory inspections made by the Ministry of Labour, industrial accidents have remained on the high side. According to the Ministry of Labour 1988 report, in 1988, 15,197 accidents were reported to the Workmen's Compensation Department. These accidents were for workmen who were injured, killed or afflicted in the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> course of work. 13,615 workmen were awarded compensation amounting to $28.8 million and $3.9 million was paid out to the families of 93 workmen who died in the course of employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour has emphasized in March this year that rate increases this round are balanced out by rate reductions for thumb, finger and toe injuries to correct anomalies. I am therefore surprised to learn that an insurance association has advised its members to increase the workmen's compensation premium by 10% arising from the changes in the workmen's compensation rates. I wonder if this increase in premium is justified, and hope that the Minister will look into this matter and discourage insurance companies from making such cost increases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more positive approach will be to encourage insurance companies to work closely with employers in improving industrial health and safety measures so as to reduce the number of industrial accidents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also fully support the new provision of clause 7 which was included to empower the Minister to vary the maximum or minimum amount of compensation payable for death and permanent incapacity. This provision will enable future changes to be made quickly in order to keep pace with changes in salary levels of workers. However, I hope that the Minister will also try to make sure that changes in compensation rates will not be followed by corresponding increases in insurance premium rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My labour MP colleagues and I have previously raised the concern of the gross inadequacy in the workmen's compensation rates, and I am glad that the Minister, soon after his announcement in Parliament in March this year, has now put in the legislation to bring the new and increased rates into effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with clause 7, there will be provision in the Act to enable compensation rates to be adjusted more regularly in the future to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> keep pace with changes in the income levels of our workers. Here, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to assure this House that his Ministry would, at regular intervals, say, every two to three years, review the compensation rates to ensure that they are fair and reasonable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have also asked the Minister previously to look into the implementation of the workmen's compensation scheme, especially at the way the claims for compensation are processed, to ensure that they would be expeditiously settled. By doing so, we will be able to alleviate the hardship of those who are unfortunate to be involved in accidents during their work and their family members as well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that clause 5 of the Amendment Bill will help the expeditious settlement of a claim. There are also other reasons why there can be delays, for example, in the medical reports to assess injuries suffered by the claimants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Minister will also ask his officials to regularly monitor the way the claims for compensation are processed to ensure that there are no unnecessary delays. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the Minister made the announcement in March, I had not compared the new rates that he mentioned with the existing rates of the principal Act, and therefore I could not even ask him any question at that time. Nevertheless, I support the Bill which in fact has been long overdue. But with increasing inflation and higher cost of living, it has been evident that old compensation rates have been unrealistically low. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, thousands of workers have paid dearly for the success of industrialisation in Singapore. Because of numerous industrial accidents and occupational hazards, thousands and thousands of workmen have suffered from various forms of industrial diseases, chemical poisoning, traumatic injuries resulting in partial or permanent physical disability and, not infrequently, in untimely deaths, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> causing great distress and hardship to their families. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensations given for disablement or death of the workmen have been scandalously low, and though bosses have made huge profits, compensations have not been raised all through the years. We frequently hear of reports of workers having been diddled of compensation, due to them according to law, by unscrupulous employers who do not insure themselves against workers' injury and accident, and so do not report accidents to the Labour Department, and in some cases do not even pay for adequate medical treatment of the injured workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also reports of cases where, though full compensation is finally paid to the injured worker, the worker is nevertheless assailed by unnecessary delays, anxieties and uncertainties about whether or not payment of compensation for injuries will be paid. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore important that employers be made to observe and carry out compensation laws to the letter. Penalties for offences by employers under the present Act should also be suitably heavy. For example, clause 3(b) of the Bill proposes that the penalty for failure of the employer to report an accident to the Commissioner be increased from $1,000 to $2,000. The sum seems ridiculously low. It is indeed derisory, as employers who deal in large sums are not likely to be deterred by a penalty of a meagre $2,000. The penalty should therefore be substantially increased to $10,000 at least, if it is to have a deterrent effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, clause 4 of the Bill should also increase the penalty for an employer, who makes deductions from the earnings of a workman to defray the cost of insurance (in the present section 23(2) of the principal Act) from $2,000 to $10,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, I might ask, have employers who have violated provisions of the present Act been prosecuted in Court? If so, how many have been prosecuted over the last few years? Would the Minister enlighten the House? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly in clause 5 (proposed section 24(9)) of the Bill, the proposed fine of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> $2,000 should be suitably increased. I suggest that all fines and penalties for violations of provisions in the Act by employers be increased. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add, Sir, that it is important also to cut red-tape and simplify compensation procedures, as has already been mentioned by another speaker, to help injured workers so that they may be paid compensations as provided in the Act in the shortest possible time. Perhaps workers should be frequently reminded of their rights, and the employers of their obligations and responsibility, in the matter of workmen's compensation now and again by the Ministry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Amendment Bill, Sir, we are indeed pleased to see that the Government has at last taken steps to increase both the minimum and maximum amounts of compensation payable in cases of death and permanent incapacity. But we cannot help pointing out that the new minimum and maximum amounts listed in the Third Schedule are still on the low side. The amounts in the present Act are fixed at a maximum compensation of $45,000, where death results, and a minimum of only $15,000. This shows how lowly the life of a worker is rated in the eyes of the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Bill proposes to increase the amount to $78,000 and $26,000, which are just increases of 70% over the past amounts. They are certainly improvements, but the amounts are hardly sufficient compensation for the loss of life of the workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the proposed Third Schedule, maximum compensation for the death of a worker aged 48 would be $78,000. This is equivalent to only 6(r) years earnings of a worker who earns $1,000 per month, that is, the amount he would have earned if he had lived to 55 years of age. Many people do not agree that this is a sufficient and fair compensation for the death of a worker who could have worked until he is 60 or 65, and who would normally have a life-span of more than 70 years of age. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly to be fair, Sir, the maximum and minimum amounts of compensation payable in the event of death, as proposed in the Amendment Bill, should be substantially increased. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the lump sum paid as compensation in the case of permanent total incapacity should also be further increased, especially in these days of rising inflation and high cost of living. In fact, workers' compensation should be computed, not only according to age and the multiplying factor in the First Schedule, but also according to the type of work which the worker has been equipped and trained to do. Thus, a telephone operator who has incurred a total loss of hearing should be compensated with an amount more than the 60% of earning capacity as provided in the First Schedule. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also somewhat puzzled as to why the compensation based on percentages of loss of earning capacity for thumb, finger and toe injuries should be reduced as proposed in the amendment Bill. We know that there have been great advances in microsurgery and hand surgery in Singapore. But should the Minister assume that the loss of function following loss of part of the thumb and fingers by a worker will be sufficiently restored by surgery, and that he will be able to perform his job almost as well as before the injury? And therefore the percentage loss of earning capacity may be reduced, and so less compensation be paid to the worker? Is that what the Minister thinks? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few simple examples to show how wrong such an assumption is. Will a musician, for example, be able to play the instruments just as well and provide just as sweet music if he should have unnaturally shortened thumbs and fingers? Will a cook, disabled by injuries with parts of the thumb and fingers removed, be able to hold a wok in cooking? Or will electricians, plumbers, ordinary construction and factory workers, be able to work as well or half as well to the satisfaction of the bosses and themselves? My guess is that such workers will probably be replaced or given less paying jobs. The proposed amendments to the First Schedule in the principal Act should therefore not be a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> reduction of but instead an addition to the percentage of the loss of earning capacity, so that the injured worker may be compensated more. If that should happen, then it explain Dr Wong's complaint about insurance companies increasing the premiums. Thus, the present 50% for loss of earning capacity for the loss of two phalanges of the thumb should not be reduced by 30%, but instead be increased to 70%, in determining the quantum of compensation payable to the injured workman. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will pay heed to what I have just said or give us a satisfactory explanation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Brickworks GRC):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in this debate. I would like to speak in support of the Bill. However, there is one point which I would like the Minister for Labour to perhaps review and that concerns the ceiling rate at which we peg the workman's compensation. For example, right now workers who earn below $1,250 per month are bound by the Workmen's Compensation Act, ie, employers have to provide payment for premiums for this category of workers. However, as the economy progresses and more and more workers are earning more than $1,250 per month, it may be necessary for the Minister to review or perhaps come up with some suggestions on how to cover that category of workers whose salaries have exceeded this $1,250 ceiling. In particular, I realise that workers who earn above $1,250 per month may be covered under personal accident policies of the companies. But there is no regulation which says that they must be covered. So it is left to the whims the judgment of the employers. I would like to hear the Minister's view on this and perhaps to incorporate certain decisions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all the Members who have spoken for supporting the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, concerning the point raised by Dr Wong Kwei Cheong, as I explained in March, my Ministry has done a study of the factory accidents which occurred last year based on the new rates. The conclusion was that, based on these new rates, the ceilings have been raised but, at the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> same time, the percentage of compensation has been lowered for thumb, finger and toe injuries. The net effect is no increase in cost for insurance companies. So there appears to be no justification for the insurance companies to raise their premiums across-the-board. Of course, it will depend on the type of industry they are operating in and their experience on actual claims. So the premiums will have to be negotiated between the insurance company and the insured party on a case-by-case basis without any interference from third parties. But in general there should not be an increase across-the-board arising from these revisions in the rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encik Othman Haron Eusofe raised the point that my Ministry should make regular reviews of the rates. Yes, we will do that, perhaps every two or three years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked that we expedite the processing of claims under the Act. I am very conscious of this point. I have been chasing my staff to make sure they expedite all the claims. As he has said, there are some delays because of assessment by doctors and so on. But to the extent possible, we should try and process the claims quickly to minimise hardship for the injured members and their families. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the points from Dr Lee Siew-Choh, I am glad to note that he too supports the Bill but, as usual, with his frame of mind in wanting us to do more and more, he wants us to raise all the ceilings and, if possible, pay everybody a lot of money for doing very little. It is true that with inflation the ceilings have to be raised and that is why we have raised the amounts by a hefty 73%. It was unfortunate that there was this long period when the rates were not changed. But during that period, what has happened is that those who suffered more serious injuries and death, they were not compensated to the levels that they deserved. But those who suffered minor injuries like finger, thumb and toe injuries were in fact over-compensated. I did explain in March this year the reason for lowering the rates for toe, thumb and finger injuries. It is because these rates are out of line with those paid by countries like UK, Germany, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Hong Kong and so forth and in fact they give rise to anomalies. For example, a workman who loses a thumb and a few fingers will end up getting more compensation than another worker who loses an entire arm. So we have to correct the anomalies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation ceilings are based on the median salary of our workmen. The new rates are based on the median salary of $716 per month, as compared to the old basis which was about $400 or so. Besides the compensation under this Act, there is also compensation, for example, in the case of death and permanent total incapacity under the Dependants' Protection Insurance Scheme of the CPF Board. So I think our workers are now better protected, not only under the Act but also under other insurance schemes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suggested that we enhance penalties for various infringements by employers. I take his point. I think we will proceed with these amendments and assess the situation. So far, most employers have insured their workmen. For example, we did a study recently. In a survey of about 2,400 employers carried out last year, only three employers were found to have failed to insure themselves under the Act, and these three will be prosecuted in court. So I want to emphasise to employers that it is very important for them financially and, of course, for their employees that they have proper insurance under the scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, concerning the point raised by Mr Chay Wai Chuen, I did explain this too in March, but he might not have been present, that the Workmen's Compensation Act insures all workmen, meaning all manual workers regardless of salary \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> levels. These are the people who are most exposed to industrial accidents. The ceiling of $1,250 is more applicable to, say, clerical staff and others who are not manual workers. We have found from experience that of the injured factory workers, 95% are already covered under the Act. So for the time being anyway, there is no need for us to review this ceiling. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lee Yock Suan]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>RECLAMATION</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Pulau Damar Laut)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S.

The Jurong Port's existing site of 63 hectares is inadequate for further expansion. Therefore, Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) proposes to develop Pulau Damar Laut. Pulau Damar's present land area of some 24 hectares will be enlarged to some 62.5 hectares by reclaiming about 38.5 hectares of the foreshore and seabed of the island as shown coloured yellow on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 2/90\", a copy of which has been displayed \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in the Library of this House for the information of hon.

The area to be dredged and deepened is shown coloured pink on the \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 2/90\". The dredging will result in the removal of about 2.5 million cubic metres of dredged materials from the foreshore and seabed which will be dumped within an area of about 100 hectares between the islands of Pulau Seraya, Pulau Meskol, Pulau Merlimau and Terembu Pesek as shown coloured blue on the same plan. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4></h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC will undertake the reclamation and dredging works which are expected to be completed in 1991 at an estimated cost of $43 million.

Fill for the reclamation will be provided by the reclamation contractor from his own source outside Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of the reclamation work, JTC proposes to construct several multi-purpose berths along the reclaimed land.
