In\r\n\r\nreturn  we offer the co-operation of this Union  in\r\n\r\ndrawing  up any clause replacing it to ensure  fair\r\n\r\nreporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union is non-political. We certainly do not\r\n\r\nintend to make party capital out of this issue.  We\r\n\r\nare  always ready and willing to co-operate  freely\r\n\r\nto  our  best  ability in maintaining the  friendly\r\n\r\nrelations  between  Press and Parliament  that  are\r\n\r\nessential  in a free Democracy. We would point  out\r\n\r\nthat  this  Union raised the matter in August  last\r\n\r\nwhen  the  order was first published and asked  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker to receive a delegation which he could  not\r\n\r\nsee his way to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask for the repeal of this clause for three reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I. No such powers exist in the Imperial Parliament\r\n\r\nat  Westminster where the Speaker is an elected\r\n\r\nMember,  equivalent  to  those  conferred  upon  the\r\n\r\nSpeaker here who is not elected by the Assembly.  We\r\n\r\nwould  point  out that the Assemblymen are  elected,\r\n\r\nthat  the Speaker is their servant but has not  been\r\n\r\nelected.  Thus an official who cannot  claim  to  be\r\n\r\nrepresentative is given arbitrary powers to bar  the\r\n\r\nPress from the democratic assembly. This seems to us\r\n\r\nworthy of Alice in Wonderland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II. As framed the clause is in our eyes\r\n\r\nutterly  unfair. The reporter is a  servant  of  his\r\n\r\nnewspaper.  What  he  writes may  be  and  often  is\r\n\r\naltered and presented in a way he cannot control. We\r\n\r\nstrongly urge that if anyone be penalised it  should\r\n\r\nbe  the editor or publisher and that their remedy is\r\n\r\nagainst  the  reporter  as in  cases  of  libel  and\r\n\r\nslander. It might be interpreted in fact as fear  to\r\n\r\nattack the powerful and victimise the weak.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, he meant remedy is against the proprietor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"III. We find no precedent for such powers of\r\n\r\njudging  what is fair and unfair vested in  one  man\r\n\r\nanywhere  in  the  Commonwealth  save  in  its  most\r\n\r\npolitically  backward  dependencies,  in   fact   in\r\n\r\nterritories  where  there  is  no  Trade  Union   of\r\n\r\nJournalists  to  fight the cause of Freedom  of  the\r\n\r\nPress.  As  to Ceylon we believe that you have  been\r\n\r\nmisinformed, Mr Chief Minister. Even were  you  not\r\n\r\nwe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould point out that Ceylon is a country where  the\r\n\r\nworking Journalist is deprived of the protection of\r\n\r\na  Trade  Union  so that we are the most  surprised\r\n\r\nthat   it  should  precisely  have  been  a  Ceylon\r\n\r\npublicist  who  raised at Melbourne  the  Issue  of\r\n\r\nPress  Freedom  on information derived  solely  and\r\n\r\nentirely  from  the  organ  of  a  Trade  Union  of Journalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally Mr Chief Minister we feel that a joint\r\n\r\nstatement  on  future intentions from yourself  and\r\n\r\nfrom  this Union be issued to the world and to  the\r\n\r\nlocal Press to calm the apprehension that has  been\r\n\r\naroused.   We   would  urge  upon   you   sir   the\r\n\r\ndesirability  of handling the whole matter  through\r\n\r\nthis Union representative of all the newspapers  in\r\n\r\nevery language group in Singapore...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the suggestion that I was\r\n\r\nmisinformed as to the Standing Orders of Ceylon,  I\r\n\r\nsought  the assistance of the Clerk of the Assembly\r\n\r\nand  have obtained, through him, from the Clerk  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ceylon  Parliament a telegram indicating  that\r\n\r\nStanding  Order 19 (3) of Ceylon is still operative\r\n\r\nand  has  been  in  force  for  many,  many  years.\r\n\r\nStanding Order 19 (3) of Ceylon reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr Speaker may grant a general permission to the\r\n\r\nrepresentative or representatives of  any  journal\r\n\r\nto attend the sitting of the House. Such permission\r\n\r\nmay  be revoked it the journal publish a report  of\r\n\r\nthe   proceedings   which  Mr  Speaker   considers\r\n\r\nunfair\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is very similar to the provisions we\r\n\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, in fairness, Sir, we should give a little\r\n\r\npublicity to the actual facts. These Standing Orders\r\n\r\nof  ours  were  adapted by a Clerk of the  House  of\r\n\r\nCommons  from  a model constitution evolved  by  the\r\n\r\nHouse  of Common authorities, and they were  brought\r\n\r\ninto  force  on the 14th of April by His  Excellency\r\n\r\nthe  Governor  under  his powers  conferred  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Colony Order in Council. The  Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters   themselves  were  consulted.   We   were\r\n\r\nnaturally  in a great hurry at that time. We  wished\r\n\r\nto hold an early sitting of this Assembly and, apart\r\n\r\nfrom  making a few alterations, the Standing  Orders\r\n\r\nwere  accepted. But, I think the House will remember\r\n\r\nthat  on the 29th of June this year, I informed  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  the  Standing Orders  were  not  wholly\r\n\r\nadequate,  and  on my motion the House  appointed  a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee to make a comprehensive review  of\r\n\r\nall  Standing Orders. In fairness to this  Assembly,\r\n\r\nSir,  it  has not had an opportunity yet to  examine\r\n\r\nthe Standing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrders,  or to take any decisions upon them, because\r\n\r\nthe  Select  Committee which  it  has  appointed  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate the matter has not yet made a report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, Sir, as in duty bound, if I may respectfully\r\n\r\nsay so, in pursuance of the requirements of Standing\r\n\r\nOrder  75, made Rule 12 about the admission  of  the\r\n\r\nPress, and this is a matter which has passed without\r\n\r\ncomment  for many decades now, not only in Singapore\r\n\r\nbut in other parts of the world; and it is more than\r\n\r\na  little  unreasonable that there should have  been\r\n\r\nthat attack, both upon Singapore and on you, Sir, as\r\n\r\na  result  of  Rule  12 which  seems  to  have  been\r\n\r\nmisconstrued.  But  in view of  the  nature  of  the\r\n\r\nrepresentations received, particularly those of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Union of Journalists, I have sent them  to\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee, and I trust that they will  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  against  the  background  of   our   own\r\n\r\ninherent  powers to refuse admission  to  strangers,\r\n\r\nand   also  our  powers  and  privileges  under  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance which has now become law in this  country,\r\n\r\nIt  may  well be found by the Select Committee  that\r\n\r\nStanding Order 75 is really tautologous, but that is\r\n\r\na  matter which must be left to the Select Committee\r\n\r\nto report to this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final matter on this, Sir. There was an\r\n\r\nunfortunate  attack  on you in  a  local  newspaper,\r\n\r\nissue  of  the  11th of November. After consultation\r\n\r\nwith the leaders of all Parties in this Assembly,  I\r\n\r\nspoke  to the editor and I am happy to report,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  he  saw the point immediately and wrote  me  a\r\n\r\nletter which I should like to read out to you.

A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I had hoped that the secondary armament  would\r\n\r\nbe  fired at a later date, but with all this rushing\r\n\r\nto  speak, I might as well get started. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  should like to state that, in view  of  the\r\n\r\nincreasing   heterogeneity   of   Parties   on   the\r\n\r\nOpposition side, such opinions as I would voice  now\r\n\r\nare  free of the influence of any party politics and\r\n\r\nI am expressing no views but my own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a banker, I have made it my business in\r\n\r\nthe   past   to  try  to  understand  something   of\r\n\r\ngovernment  finance, and I found little to  surprise\r\n\r\nme   in   the  speech  of  the  Hon. the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary,  which  though  it  emphasised  that  the\r\n\r\nColony's   financial   position   was   sound,   was\r\n\r\nnevertheless something of a jeremiad.  This  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,   in   the  best  tradition   of   Financial\r\n\r\nSecretaries, and the present incumbent is as jealous\r\n\r\na  watchdog  of government finance as  any  we  have\r\n\r\nseen.  His predecessor uttered grave warnings  about\r\n\r\nthe  necessity  for cutting down on  expenditure  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments, and  I  trust  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment will make every effort to live within its\r\n\r\nmeans. Certainly from the number of amendments  that\r\n\r\nappear  in the Estimates, it would appear  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition   is  going  to  try  to   persuade   the\r\n\r\nGovernment into this way of thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the figures given on pages 10 and 11 of the\r\n\r\nSessional  Paper  No. Cmd. 28 of 1955  of  \"Personal\r\n\r\nEmoluments\"  and \"Other Charges Annually  Recurrent\"\r\n\r\nfor  Education, Medical and Social Welfare, the rise\r\n\r\nis steep enough in all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsciousness. Yet the Sessional Paper  states  that\r\n\r\nduring  the  next  five years expenditure  on  those\r\n\r\nservices  is expected to increase with even  greater\r\n\r\nrapidity.  This point was given further  elucidation\r\n\r\nby  the  Hon. the Financial Secretary in his speech,\r\n\r\nand  it  appears  that even after allowing  for  the\r\n\r\nstreamlining of the Government machine as  a  whole,\r\n\r\nwe  shall be faced, on the present basis of revenue,\r\n\r\nwith  an annual deficit in the region of $40 million\r\n\r\nin  five  years' time. Now this is indeed a sobering\r\n\r\nthought and however unpalatable it may be, it  seems\r\n\r\nobvious  that  increased taxation is both  necessary\r\n\r\nand   inevitable.  I  do  sincerely  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of all right-thinking citizens will  be  a\r\n\r\nsympathetic one towards Government in its problem - a\r\n\r\ndifficult  problem  indeed - with  the  gulf   between\r\n\r\nrevenue  and expenditure already wide and likely  to\r\n\r\nwiden  further as the years pass. The problem indeed\r\n\r\nseems  almost  to  be  insoluble.  That  more  money\r\n\r\nannually  must  be spent on education,  health,  and\r\n\r\nsocial welfare goes without saying, and someone must\r\n\r\nfoot  the  bill. Nevertheless, care must  surely  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to see that we do not interfere with business\r\n\r\nas a whole, and that capital is not scared away from\r\n\r\nthe Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust the House will take heed of the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary's warning that the greatest care  must  be\r\n\r\ntaken not to let the Colony's reserves run too  low,\r\n\r\nand  note his observation that the market for  local\r\n\r\nloans  is not unlimited in capacity. The market  for\r\n\r\nlocal  loans is indeed the very reverse of unlimited\r\n\r\nin capacity. There have been occasions recently when\r\n\r\nthe  City Council have tried to raise money in local\r\n\r\nloans,  and had it not been for a substantial demand\r\n\r\nby  the  Central  Provident Fund of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment, the loans would have met with very  poor\r\n\r\nsuccess  indeed. Now, one of the reasons  for  this,\r\n\r\nSir - I  could give many - is that there just is  not  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of money around seeking this particular\r\n\r\ntype of investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, one of the most interesting things about\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Financial Secretary's speech  was  the\r\n\r\nuninhibited  way in which he told us of the  various\r\n\r\nproposals  for  increased  taxation  that  had  been\r\n\r\nconsidered and rejected. We also know, at  least  to\r\n\r\nsome  extent, what we may expect in the future.  One\r\n\r\nwould  expect a Government, Socialist in background,\r\n\r\nto  introduce increased taxation on the upper income\r\n\r\ngroup.  I  do  not  quarrel with  the  principle  of\r\n\r\nplacing  the burden of taxation on the shoulders  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  are best able to bear it, but no  effort\r\n\r\nshould  be spared to increase the efficiency of  the\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax  Department to make certain  that  those\r\n\r\npeople who are capable of paying it do pay it.  That\r\n\r\nthere  is tax evasion on a large scale seems  highly\r\n\r\nprobable.  I  certainly have heard  plenty  of  talk\r\n\r\nabout it in Singapore over the last five years.  The\r\n\r\ncurious  thing,  Mr Speaker, is how people's  moral\r\n\r\nstandards  change when it comes to paying Government\r\n\r\nits  just  dues. I know quite decent people - you  can\r\n\r\ncall  them  businessmen - who  would  shudder  at  the\r\n\r\nthought  of  dishonouring a  business  contract  but\r\n\r\nwould  do  almost anything and go to any lengths  to\r\n\r\nevade  paying  their tax. All is fair apparently  in\r\n\r\nlove,  war and dodging income tax! And we all  know,\r\n\r\nSir,  the type of person, usually female, who boasts\r\n\r\nof  having diddled the Customs! While it is good  to\r\n\r\nlearn  that  proposals  for  joint  action  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernments  of  Singapore and the Federation  \"were\r\n\r\ndiscussed  with  cordiality  and  understanding\" - the\r\n\r\nphrase  used - at Kuala Lumpur, it is noteworthy  that\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  Government  effectively  threw   a\r\n\r\nspanner  in the works. In this way, we may  see  the\r\n\r\nshape  of things to come. I accept unreservedly  the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary's  explanation  of  why  common\r\n\r\naction  in  respect  of income tax  is  regarded  as\r\n\r\nessential, but I trust that we are not going  to  be\r\n\r\nruled from Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it is only natural that one should feel\r\n\r\nrelieved  that  the  Budget  proposals  contain   no\r\n\r\nprovision  for increase of income tax, but  that  is\r\n\r\nmerely a brief respite, as the Financial Se-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncretary  has been at pains to make clear. I have  no\r\n\r\ncomplaints about the indirect taxes that  have  been\r\n\r\nimposed, but I must confess to being astonished that\r\n\r\ntobacco  has  escaped. To pass  up  $19  million  of\r\n\r\nrevenue,   or   potential  revenue,  when   one   is\r\n\r\nscratching  around  for means  of  meeting  a  hefty\r\n\r\ndeficit  is,  to  my  mind, quite  incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nThere is, to me, something distinctly humorous about\r\n\r\nthe   pomposity  of  the  phrase  \"the  Council   of\r\n\r\nMinisters had in mind that intoxicating liquor  was,\r\n\r\nin  fact, a luxury. It could not, by any stretch  of\r\n\r\nthe imagination, be called a necessity.\" Well, there\r\n\r\nare  some  who  would disagree with the  Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters!  Now, Sir, I have all the  vices - I  drink\r\n\r\nwhisky,  I smoke cigarettes and - I sing in  my  bath!\r\n\r\nBut I am as firmly of the opinion as the Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters is about liquor (why gin escaped, I do not\r\n\r\nknow!) that cigarettes can, in no circumstances,  be\r\n\r\ncalled  a  necessity. In the United Kingdom  smokers\r\n\r\nhave to pay heavily for the habit, and I do not  see\r\n\r\nwhy  the  man-in-the-street in Singapore should  not\r\n\r\npay a little and help to shoulder the burden by this\r\n\r\nsimple method of indirect taxation. I do not seek an\r\n\r\nelaboration of Government's brief statement - \"It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  decided  that it would be undesirable  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  time  to increase the tax on cigarettes  by\r\n\r\neven  a small amount.\" I can guess what is in  their\r\n\r\nminds, and I can only regard their attitude in  this\r\n\r\nrespect as timorous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Hon. the Financial Secretary has informed us  in\r\n\r\nhis Budget speech that the expenditure for 1956 will\r\n\r\nexceed the revenue and that the deficit next year is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be real. This kind of warning from  those\r\n\r\nwho  prepared previous Budgets has always  been  too\r\n\r\noften  repeated, and naturally enough we would  like\r\n\r\nto  give the warning the discount it deserves.  Even\r\n\r\nthen, no matter whichever way our belief is going to\r\n\r\nbe,  the  fact  that we have to  face  now  is  that\r\n\r\nindirect  taxation  in a number of  commodities  has\r\n\r\nincreased. We will have to work from the angle  that\r\n\r\nwe have just a limited income and how best to spend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  in  the interests of the majority of the people.\r\n\r\nTo  achieve this aim, we must remember that although\r\n\r\nthere  are  many claims for development  in  various\r\n\r\ndirections and from many parts of Singapore, we must\r\n\r\nsort  out  what is the most important and what  will\r\n\r\ngive  benefit  to  most  people,  in  preference  to\r\n\r\nschemes  that  will  serve an  exclusive  number  of\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if we were to decide whether there\r\n\r\nshould  be lighting for a place like Goodwood  Hill,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  people  travel in  large  and  beautiful\r\n\r\ncars - they  do  not,  most  of  them,  walk  late  at\r\n\r\nnight - or  lighting for Serangoon Gardens, where  the\r\n\r\npopulation is denser and more people travel on  foot\r\n\r\nand   bicycles,  then  I  think  we  will  have   no\r\n\r\nhesitation  in  saying that the latter  category  is\r\n\r\nmore  deserving. Of course, money in that  direction\r\n\r\nwould  have to be voted to the Rural Board. This  is\r\n\r\njust like making a decision with a limited amount of\r\n\r\nmoney, whether we should buy cosmetics for our  girl\r\n\r\nor  buy  a pair of specs for the shortsighted  one!\r\n\r\nYou  will always come to the right decision, and not\r\n\r\nthrow  your money on luxuries. Now, I always believe\r\n\r\nthat  schemes like lighting of Goodwood Hill is  one\r\n\r\nthat can wait and must wait, and that any money that\r\n\r\nwe can make use of must be diverted to other schemes\r\n\r\nthat are more important and urgent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again it will not be out of place here to mention\r\n\r\nthat,  in  an  austerity  programme,  those  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should set a good example in the need for\r\n\r\neconomy.  From  the  Budget you will  see  that  the\r\n\r\nMinisters amongst themselves have appropriated  sums\r\n\r\nranging  from  $2,000  to $10,000  as  entertainment\r\n\r\nallowances.  Drinking  champagne  and  having  satay\r\n\r\nparties  are  part  of  the necessary  functions  of\r\n\r\nMinisters, but at a time when there is going to be a\r\n\r\ndeficit  in the Budget and the whole city is fraught\r\n\r\nwith  strikes and unemployment, the cutting down  of\r\n\r\nsuch parties to a minimum would not be a bad idea. I\r\n\r\nwould  rather  say  that  a few  Aspros,  which  are\r\n\r\ncheaper, might be more helpful in bringing  about  a\r\n\r\nmore prosperous and peaceful Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Labour Front Coalition Government, and we\r\n\r\nare  constantly reminded that it will carry  out  its\r\n\r\nSocialist  programme.  It  has  promised  the  people\r\n\r\ninterest-free loans for those who want to build their\r\n\r\nown  houses. As one who might like to take  advantage\r\n\r\nof  such  an  offer, I looked diligently through  the\r\n\r\npages  of the Budget, but, alas, the long hoped-for\r\n\r\nGovernment  interest-free loan was not there.  I  was\r\n\r\ndisappointed.  That  hope,  raised  so  high  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, crashed. However, this is not only a  bad\r\n\r\nomission,  but  there are other events which  smashed\r\n\r\nthat  crashed  hope  to  smithereens.  The  Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary has had a word of congratulation\r\n\r\nfor the Rural Board for raising more revenue. Let  me\r\n\r\nacquaint  the House of one method of achieving  this.\r\n\r\nRecently  I  have received many representations  from\r\n\r\nclerks  working in the Government, the  City  Council\r\n\r\nand  the  Services,  who  happen  to  own  houses  in\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Garden Estate. They do not  get  interest-free  loans,  but they have to pay interest,  and  it\r\n\r\nwill  take them about 15 years to repay the loans  by\r\n\r\nmonthly  instalments, and yet  the  Rural  Board  has\r\n\r\ndeemed  fit  to  exact  a higher  tax  from  them  by\r\n\r\nincreasing  the  annual value of  their  houses.  The\r\n\r\nground  for  such increases seems to be  that  a  few\r\n\r\nhouses  were let out to Service personnel  at  higher\r\n\r\nrentals. Owner residents protested to the Board,  but\r\n\r\ntheir pleas were ignored. It seems to me that in that\r\n\r\nlocality the innocent must be punished together  with\r\n\r\nthe  guilty. It is important that wage earners should\r\n\r\nbe  encouraged to own land and houses,  but  if  they\r\n\r\nreckon  that they have to pay more in the way of  tax\r\n\r\nwhen  living in their own houses than the rents which\r\n\r\nthey  paid  for their old pre-war houses, then  where\r\n\r\ndoes the encouragement come from? Your slums will  be\r\n\r\nharder  to  clear up, and, of course, there  will  be\r\n\r\nmore  savings  for the Public Works Department.  That\r\n\r\nprobably   will  suit  the  Government  in  providing\r\n\r\nexcuses for holding up further development plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tune that is being played now is \"no money\", and\r\n\r\nplaying that tune you might as well go the whole  hog\r\n\r\nand examine how this tallies with the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  you  refer to the Head: Minister of  Health,  you\r\n\r\nwill  discover that large sums of money are  allotted\r\n\r\nfor  the  purposes  of alterations of  hospitals.  We\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask just one question on  this.  Will\r\n\r\nsuch  alterations mean a gain in the  number  of  bed\r\n\r\nspace  in the hospitals? As far as I am aware  today,\r\n\r\nthere have been no such increases in the past, and  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  expect any increase in the future.  Instead,\r\n\r\nyou  will probably find that the ward is just changed\r\n\r\ninto another shape, and air-conditioning included  in\r\n\r\ncertain parts of the ward -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Wholly erroneous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I say here that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are not fastidious. The masses  here  have\r\n\r\nendured the heat from time immemorial and they prefer\r\n\r\nsuch  heat to artificial cooling. In all probability,\r\n\r\nthey  would suffer from the discomfort of cold,  just\r\n\r\nas  I  often  do  in  this Assembly,  which  is  air-conditioned! The first essential of a hospital is  to\r\n\r\ncure,  and it is highly preferable that the money  to\r\n\r\nbe  used for alterations should be utilised to  build\r\n\r\nnew  district hospitals. The sum involved in this instance is in the region of about $2 million, with  no\r\n\r\nincrease in bed space. That money, I should  say,  is\r\n\r\njust  wasted. Talking about district hospitals, you\r\n\r\nwill  have  one going to be built next  year  with  a\r\n\r\ntoken of $10. Nothing concrete in that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now talking again of savings on expenditure,\r\n\r\nGovernment  should always make it their business  to\r\n\r\nsee  that whenever appointments are made, they should\r\n\r\nbe absolutely necessary. I quote you another instance\r\n\r\nunder  the Head: Ministry of Health. It would appear,\r\n\r\nI think, that seven Radiologists are to be appointed.\r\n\r\nAt  present you have two. But that hospital has  only\r\n\r\none General Duty Medical Officer. The other posts are\r\n\r\nstill  not  filled and you are voting money  for  new\r\n\r\nposts. Why is that necessary? I always think that in\r\n\r\nany  set-up - take the case of the Police - if  you  have\r\n\r\nsix  constables, then you have one corporal.  If  you\r\n\r\nhave  so many corporals, then you have one inspector,\r\n\r\nbut  you cannot have seven inspectors and one  lance-corporal.  They  do  not need so many  inspectors  to\r\n\r\ncontrol one lance-corporal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me now turn to the Ministry of Education. As\r\n\r\na  school-master  I am drowned daily  by  pleas  from\r\n\r\nparents  wanting  to  get their  children  places  in\r\n\r\nschools, primary as well as secondary. It is  obvious\r\n\r\nthat Singapore wants more schools - primary as well  as\r\n\r\nsecondary.  They  want more vernacular  schools,  and\r\n\r\nthey   want  more  trade  schools.  Now  it  is   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  responsibility,  in  drawing   up   the\r\n\r\nBudget, to see that this important aspect of work  is\r\n\r\ntackled. The general level of education of the masses\r\n\r\nin this country must be raised, and I should say that\r\n\r\nthe  greatest  treasure that a  nation  can  possess,\r\n\r\nespecially one like us that is striving towards self-government and independence, must be to create a very\r\n\r\nhigh percentage of well-educated people. Secondary as\r\n\r\nwell as higher education is what we must have if  our\r\n\r\ndreams for early Malayanisation of the services is to\r\n\r\nbe  realised.  More schools, more technical  schools,\r\n\r\nschemes and assistance for training within industries\r\n\r\nare  lines  which  should  be  adopted  as  insurance\r\n\r\nschemes against future unemployment. But what  do  we\r\n\r\nfind  in  the  Budget?  No  provision  for  secondary\r\n\r\nschools in 1956. That is a very grave omission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the direction of social services, what do we\r\n\r\nfind after all the shouting by Government at the  top\r\n\r\nof  the roof? Do they do a little more for the under-privileged?   We   find  that  the  present   elected\r\n\r\nGovernment  is even worse than the previous  colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment. Whereas a colonial Government had between\r\n\r\n1954 and 1955 increased its social service assistance\r\n\r\nby  50  per cent to youth organisations - and, in  this\r\n\r\ninstance,  it  means  the  boys'  and  girls'   clubs\r\n\r\ncatering   for  the  under-privileged   children   of\r\n\r\nSingapore - the  present Government is happy  with  the\r\n\r\nfigure  for 1955, ignoring completely the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  number of clubs catering for such youth is about\r\n\r\ntreble.  It is very well to sit in an air-conditioned\r\n\r\nroom  and  claim yourself to be a Socialist  fighting\r\n\r\nfor  the uplift of the under-privileged and the down-trodden,  but I would rather invite you to  come  out\r\n\r\nand  work  amongst  them. I am the President  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Boys Clubs, and I voice the dis-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsatisfaction of 40 times 400 youths of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On community centres, we are promised another three\r\n\r\nat  a  cost  of  a  token $10. I know what  community\r\n\r\ncentres are. I work in them, take a very active  part\r\n\r\nin   them,  but  I  believe  that  it  will  be  more\r\n\r\nbeneficial to support communities, to help them build\r\n\r\ntheir  own centres,- assisting them with sums  ranging\r\n\r\nprobably  from  $10,000 to $20,000,  rather  than  to\r\n\r\nbuild one that will cost $150,000, if it were built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if care had been exercised in the matter of\r\n\r\nexpenditure, I believe that there would not have been\r\n\r\nthe  necessity of additional taxation. At present the\r\n\r\nGovernment is not only imposing new taxes on  liquor,\r\n\r\npetrol  and  estate duty, but it is also holding  the\r\n\r\nthreat  of  further taxation over the  heads  of  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore. I do not know what tactic this\r\n\r\nis.  Is  it  to  give  a boost to traders  in  luxury\r\n\r\ncommodities by telling them what items will  probably\r\n\r\nbe  taxed in the middle of next year or somewhere  in\r\n\r\nbetween?  If  it  is, then it has produced  excellent\r\n\r\nresults.  I  am  personally  aware  of  many   sudden\r\n\r\ndecisions to acquire new cars, new radios and so  on.\r\n\r\nIf  this  information is to assist the  gathering  of\r\n\r\nmore  revenue later on, then I must say, from what  I\r\n\r\nhave  already mentioned before, that it has  received\r\n\r\nits  first  setback.  However, coming  back  to  this\r\n\r\nuncertain  tax problem, it will definitely  create  a\r\n\r\nrather unstable state of affairs in the local market,\r\n\r\nand probably it will lead to hoarding and placing  of\r\n\r\nunnecessary orders on luxury lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of taxation on petrol, I must point\r\n\r\nout  to  the Government that this commodity  is  used\r\n\r\ndirectly  by  the  owners of cars  and  lorries,  and\r\n\r\nindirectly  paid  for  by the public  who  travel  in\r\n\r\nvehicles  using petrol, or farmers hiring lorries  to\r\n\r\ncart their feedstuffs back to their farms. Now if the\r\n\r\nfare and the cost of hire of lorries are going to  be\r\n\r\nincreased  because of the increase of tax on  petrol,\r\n\r\nthen this form of taxation will not he placed on  the\r\n\r\nshoulders  of those who can best bear it.

P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, to me the most\r\n\r\ndisconcerting  fact  emerging  from  the   Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary's disclosure  of  the  estimated\r\n\r\nAssets  and Liabilities is that we are faced  with  a\r\n\r\npossibility of a capital loss to the extent of  $10.6\r\n\r\nmillions in the event of our realising the investment\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the  Special  Reserve  Fund  of  $106.6\r\n\r\nmillions. The depreciation in the value of the  long-term  securities  in which the moneys  are  invested,\r\n\r\namount to more than ten per cent of the actual  cost,\r\n\r\nand  Sessional  Paper No. Cmd. 28 of  1955  does  not\r\n\r\nindicate   the   extent  to  which  other   long-term\r\n\r\nsecurities have fallen in value. I am sure, Sir, that\r\n\r\nwe  have learnt a costly lesson in allowing our hard-earned and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmuch needed surpluses to be invested abroad while  we\r\n\r\nsuffer the reputation of a capital-hungry country  in\r\n\r\nother  parts  of  the  world. I  believe,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nGovernment  should set an example in  the  future  by\r\n\r\nallowing its surpluses, temporary or otherwise, to be\r\n\r\ninvested in this, and this country only. Government's\r\n\r\nneed  in  this connection is of paramount importance.\r\n\r\nIt  is a matter for regret and deep concern that more\r\n\r\nthan 45 per cent of the assets of the banks operating\r\n\r\nlocally  are  invested abroad - I am quoting  from  the\r\n\r\nreport  of the International Bank Mission - and a  good\r\n\r\nnumber  of institutional investors, such as insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies,  still  continue to invest  a  substantial\r\n\r\nproportion of their assets in foreign countries.  The\r\n\r\noutward  look  approach of the Government  should  be\r\n\r\nchanged   to  one  of  inward  look  in  matters   of\r\n\r\ndisposition of investible funds. Only then  could  we\r\n\r\nplace  ourselves  in  a position  to  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector of our economy to act in the national\r\n\r\ninterests in these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, considering the future prospects of surpluses\r\n\r\nin our budgetary operations, it seems to me that they\r\n\r\nare  unlikely to be of such a magnitude as to  create\r\n\r\ninflationary tendencies if they are invested  locally\r\n\r\nby  means of short-term deposits in our local banking\r\n\r\ninstitutions. No doubt the management of Government's\r\n\r\nmonetary affairs will be greatly facilitated  by  the\r\n\r\nproposed  Central Bank when it comes into  operation,\r\n\r\nbut  until  this happens, wiser management  would  be\r\n\r\nnecessary.  The  time  has  come,  Sir,  to  consider\r\n\r\nrealising some of our external investments for social\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  such  as housing,  and  for  Government\r\n\r\npartnership in local industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I deplore the inordinate delay in presenting\r\n\r\nthe  accounts  of the Colony for the  year  1954  for\r\n\r\nscrutiny  by  the Public Accounts Committee.  Members\r\n\r\nare  therefore  precluded  from  making  constructive\r\n\r\ncomments on the Budget before the House, and they are\r\n\r\nunable to say whether value has been obtained for the\r\n\r\nmoney  voted  in  the  past  for  expenditure.  I  am\r\n\r\nwondering,  Sir, if the Hon. the Financial  Secretary\r\n\r\ncould  say  when  these  audited  accounts  will   be\r\n\r\npresented  to  the  Public  Accounts  Committee   for\r\n\r\nscrutiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again it is a matter of great concern that\r\n\r\nthere  was a significant fall in the amount of  yield\r\n\r\nfrom direct taxation in 1954. There is no doubt that,\r\n\r\nin  the  absence of supporting data, the  fall  could\r\n\r\nhave  been attributed wholly to diminution in company\r\n\r\nprofits.  It  would be enlightening if the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial   Secretary   could   produce,   for    the\r\n\r\ninformation  of  this House, the numbers  of  various\r\n\r\nclasses  of tax-payers - individuals, partnerships  and\r\n\r\ncompanies - who  paid tax in 1954 and 1955,  so  as  to\r\n\r\nindicate the rate of growth in the different  classes\r\n\r\nof  tax-payers, and variations in the size  of  their\r\n\r\nincomes. The question of formulating a common  policy\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation is indeed very welcome.  It  is\r\n\r\nhoped  that the two Governments will be able to reach\r\n\r\na  final agreement favourable to the mutual interests\r\n\r\nof both territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also very much concerned about the\r\n\r\nquestion of housing our population. Time and again we\r\n\r\nhave  been told that the Singapore Improvement  Trust\r\n\r\nwill  offer  houses at a low rental rate.  These  low\r\n\r\nrentals  happen to be about $25 to $30 a  month,  and\r\n\r\nthis,  together  with the lighting, water  and  other\r\n\r\nservices,  would  go up to such an  extent  that  the\r\n\r\nordinary man, who receives a salary of $100 to $150 a\r\n\r\nmonth,  could  hardly pay such rates.  We  have  been\r\n\r\nassured,  Sir,  very recently that  the  question  of\r\n\r\nlowering  housing  rentals is  receiving  the  active\r\n\r\nconsideration of the Government. But I see  there  is\r\n\r\nlittle that the Government could do with its existing\r\n\r\nfiscal  policy. Rents are still not within the paying\r\n\r\ncapacity of the working class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would commend the following suggestions for\r\n\r\nthe  Government's consideration, as I  feel  that  no\r\n\r\nother  method  could bring down the  rents  of  those\r\n\r\nhouses built by the Singapore Improvement Trust.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  interest-free loans, and  I  am  sure,  as\r\n\r\nGovernment has promised it, money will be forthcoming\r\n\r\ninterest-free  for  building  accommodation  for  the\r\n\r\nworking class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, apart from this, I would also suggest a direct\r\n\r\nsubsidy   from  Government  sources  to  the  housing\r\n\r\nauthority. The City Council of Singapore have so far\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  or implied that they have no obligation at  all\r\n\r\ntowards the housing of Singapore's citizens. This  is\r\n\r\nvery  obvious indeed, and even the other day the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Housing turned down the  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  the  assessment rates on S.I.T. buildings  and\r\n\r\nland  should  be waived by the City Council.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink we are all aware of the fact that outside  this\r\n\r\nterritory,  in  places like the  United  Kingdom  and\r\n\r\nelsewhere,  the  housing authority grants  loans  for\r\n\r\nbuilding houses and also gives a separate subsidy  on\r\n\r\nhouses  built  by  the  local  authorities.  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest, Sir, that either the City Council waive  the\r\n\r\nassessment  rates on S.I.T. land and houses,  or  get\r\n\r\nthem  to  pay as contribution towards the housing  of\r\n\r\nthe citizens an amount equal to the assessment rates,\r\n\r\nor even more if they are in a position to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, having known a little bit of difficulty\r\n\r\nin  the  S.I.T.,  I  realise that  if  some  external\r\n\r\nassistance were to be given in the matter of housing,\r\n\r\nsuch as the loan of bulldozers and other earth-moving\r\n\r\nmachines, we could considerably lower the rentals  of\r\n\r\nthese  houses. I have heard the other  day  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the  Federation  have  received  some\r\n\r\nbulldozers   and  other  earth-moving  machines   for\r\n\r\nagricultural  purposes  from outside  sources.  I  am\r\n\r\nwondering,  Sir, whether our Government  cannot  seek\r\n\r\nthe   assistance  of  the  United  Kingdom  or  other\r\n\r\ncountries  for  a donation of that kind  towards  the\r\n\r\nrelieving of our housing problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other matter on which I would like to\r\n\r\ntouch  in  regard to housing, Sir, and that  is  slum\r\n\r\nclearance. I would not like to dwell too much on this\r\n\r\nbecause  I believe that the Government will undertake\r\n\r\nslum  clearance at the earliest possible date. I  can\r\n\r\nsee  that some start has been made and I do hope they\r\n\r\nwill go on very vigorously with this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last grouse that I have about housing is in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  standard of accommodation  of  these\r\n\r\nS.I.T. houses.  Sir, all countries usually  adopt  a\r\n\r\nstandard  accommodation, it  is  sometimes  called  a\r\n\r\nnational standard. Well, in Singapore today we have a\r\n\r\nstandard accommodation provided by the S.I.T. and  I\r\n\r\nthink it is a very bad standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese  S.I.T. houses are not very well  constructed\r\n\r\nand   the   facilities  to  tenants  are  far   from\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.  There is very little room  for  baths\r\n\r\nand  lavatories  and  there are  no  facilities  for\r\n\r\ndining purposes. This was confirmed by the Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Housing  the other  day.  Sir,  these\r\n\r\nhouses are built to last from 20 to 60 years. No one\r\n\r\ncan  deny that. The standard of living of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore during the coming five to eight  years\r\n\r\nwould  be  so high that, after that period,  tenants\r\n\r\nwho  live in those houses which have no dining rooms\r\n\r\nwould  feel  rather out of place. Also  during  that\r\n\r\nperiod,   private   development  will   take   place\r\n\r\nresulting in an increased number of houses, and I am\r\n\r\nsure the consequence will be that these tenants will\r\n\r\ntry  to  vacate these S.I.T. houses at the  earliest\r\n\r\npossible date -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Let the people live satisfactorily!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to dwell on is rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Sir,  ever since  I  got  on  to  this\r\n\r\nCouncil in 1952, I have been stressing this question\r\n\r\nof rural development very hard indeed. At one time I\r\n\r\nwas told that there was no need for any development.\r\n\r\nThere was no need for any particular person or  body\r\n\r\nto look into this matter, because there was one body\r\n\r\ncalled  the  Rural Board which should undertake  all\r\n\r\nrural development. And what is the result today? The\r\n\r\nRural Board has been unable to provide the amenities\r\n\r\nwhich  the  rural people should get.  There  are  no\r\n\r\nplaying  fields  in the rural areas.  There  are  no\r\n\r\nlibraries in the rural areas. There is not even  the\r\n\r\nbarest  minimum  requirement in the rural  areas  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to  the  city. Unemployment  is  mounting.\r\n\r\nNormally,  unemployment is not a big grouse  in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas, because even those who have employment\r\n\r\nare under-employed. They have no gainful employment,\r\n\r\nand I have not seen so far any Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasure  being  adopted to relieve  under-employment\r\n\r\nand unemployment in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education in rural areas: Sir, the reason for my\r\n\r\npointing out all these things is because I feel that\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the rural areas should  be  treated\r\n\r\nquite   separately  from  development  within   city\r\n\r\nlimits,  because in rural areas the  conditions  are\r\n\r\nquite  different. I suggest, Sir, that in regard  to\r\n\r\neducation in rural areas there is no need  to  spend\r\n\r\nmuch  money  on schools. We should devise  a  scheme\r\n\r\nwhereby  we  build  village  schools - which  are  the\r\n\r\ncheapest  schools to build - and that,  too,  in  good\r\n\r\nnumber  to satisfy the requirements of the locality.\r\n\r\nThe costs that have been shown in the Estimates,  in\r\n\r\nmy view, are very high indeed. I do not think that a\r\n\r\nprimary  school which can accommodate  400  children\r\n\r\nshould cost $50,000. Village schools can be built at\r\n\r\nmuch less cost than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, adult education in Singapore to a certain\r\n\r\nextent  has been decentralised. I should think  that\r\n\r\nmore  energy  should be put into  this  question  of\r\n\r\nsetting  up more adult education centres to  satisfy\r\n\r\nthe requirements of the rural community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was the day before yesterday, I think,\r\n\r\nthat  I read in one of the newspapers, the Singapore\r\n\r\nStandard, an article to the effect that Singapore is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  have  a new library, and that  is  to  be\r\n\r\nlocated at Stamford Road. Sir, I have often wondered\r\n\r\nwhy  the  Government is so keen on centralising  all\r\n\r\nthese amenities in the centre of the city. Cannot we\r\n\r\nhave  some  libraries in areas  like  Katong,  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang  or  any other places? Should we concentrate\r\n\r\nall  the learning and knowledge of this Colony  into\r\n\r\nthis  one part of the city? I should think  this  is\r\n\r\nvery  wrong.  We should as far as possible  give  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to people to make use of  this  library\r\n\r\nnearer  to  their  homes.  If  the  answer  to  this\r\n\r\nquestion  is  that  Government  are  having  a   few\r\n\r\ntravelling libraries, I do not think, Sir,  that  it\r\n\r\nis  a  very  good  suggestion at all.  A  travelling\r\n\r\nlibrary is most unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  may say that something  is  better\r\n\r\nthan  nothing. But let us not treat a  library\r\n\r\nin  this way. Let us have it established where\r\n\r\nit  is  desirable and necessary.  Let  us  not\r\n\r\nconcentrate it in one part of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roads in the rural areas today are a\r\n\r\nmost unsatisfactory form of communication  and\r\n\r\nmode of travelling. In very many parts of  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas you have only one main road,  and\r\n\r\nthe  farmers and the agriculturists, who  have\r\n\r\nto  make use of lorries and other vehicles for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of  conveying their  fodder  and\r\n\r\nother   things,  are  undergoing  considerable\r\n\r\ndifficulty.  I am not unmindful  of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  this costs a big sum of money, but I  do\r\n\r\nsuggest   that  in  order  to  overcome   this\r\n\r\ndifficulty, consideration should be  given  to\r\n\r\nsetting  up a road authority, or some kind  of\r\n\r\nauthority, to speed up road work in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, land and housing is another important\r\n\r\nproblem in the rural areas. I can only say for\r\n\r\ncertain  in  regard to conditions  in  my  own\r\n\r\nconstituency. 90 per cent of the population in\r\n\r\nmy  constituency are living on other  people's\r\n\r\nland. This does not mean that all people  have\r\n\r\nland   in  other  areas,  but  the  need   for\r\n\r\nstressing  this point is because of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat,  due to gradual development in the rural\r\n\r\nareas,  many  of  these attap-hut  owners  are\r\n\r\nreceiving notices to quit their places and  go\r\n\r\nto  other areas. If that comes about, it means\r\n\r\nthat  they will be deprived not only of  their\r\n\r\nhuts but the piece of land which was given  to\r\n\r\nthem on payment of monthly rents. They are put\r\n\r\nin a position where they can obtain no land in\r\n\r\nthe  vicinity.  The only alternative  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  have  to shift  to  various  other\r\n\r\nplaces  which will in turn inconvenience  them\r\n\r\nin very many ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to housing, particularly in the\r\n\r\nrural  areas, I can see no evidence  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust has taken it as  a\r\n\r\nmatter   of  urgency.  It  may  be  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment might have thought that, since most\r\n\r\ncommercial firms are in the heart of the  city\r\n\r\nand the whole economy is connected to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollyer  Quay,  there  is  little  benefit  in\r\n\r\nbuilding  houses in the rural areas. I  should\r\n\r\nthink  a  separate scheme for  rural  housing,\r\n\r\nmore  or  less on a semi-permanent  basis,  be\r\n\r\ninstituted    and   satellite   semi-permanent\r\n\r\nstructure    buildings    in    villages    be\r\n\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all the points that I have dealt with\r\n\r\nin  regard  to the rural areas have been  with\r\n\r\none  purpose,  and  that is  because,  at  the\r\n\r\npresent moment, development in the rural areas\r\n\r\nis   slow  and  being  done  piecemeal.   Each\r\n\r\ndepartment  thinks of its own requirements  in\r\n\r\neach   village  and  there  is   very   little\r\n\r\nco-ordination that I can see in these  matters.\r\n\r\nThe only way, the quickest way, and the surest\r\n\r\nway  of getting things done on a planned basis\r\n\r\nin  the  rural areas is to establish  a  Rural\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Council where all the departments\r\n\r\ninterested  are represented, with  an  elected\r\n\r\nMinister  as  its chairman, and  this  Council\r\n\r\nassessing the requirements of the rural areas,\r\n\r\nplanning  their development and seeing  to  it\r\n\r\nthat  those  plans  are  implemented.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  Sir,  due to a lack of  co-ordination\r\n\r\nand  due  to the fact that all departments  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  alike in the rural  areas,  things\r\n\r\nhave  gone  very unsatisfactorily,  and,  from\r\n\r\nexperience,  I feel that the only  way  for  a\r\n\r\nplanned rural development is the creation of a\r\n\r\nRural    Development    Council    and     the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  those  schemes   by   that\r\n\r\nauthority. I am sure that the Commission which\r\n\r\nhas  been appointed by the Chief Minister will\r\n\r\nconsider my proposal and see whether it  could\r\n\r\nbe implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have nothing much to say on other\r\n\r\nmatters, because I feel it is only a matter of\r\n\r\ndetail.  Many  of  the  items  of  expenditure\r\n\r\ninserted  in this Budget are mere figures.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers are careful enough, and if  the\r\n\r\ndepartment heads are careful enough, there  is\r\n\r\nalways  room  for  curtailing expenditure  and\r\n\r\nexercising the utmost economy. I have only one\r\n\r\ncomment, though, and that is the entertainment\r\n\r\nexpenses  of the Ministers. Sir, I  feel  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has no explanation to give  to\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore on this item -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Far from it. My hon. Friend has added  to\r\n\r\nthe  uncertainties  which have shrouded  the  country\r\n\r\nsince the Government opposite took office, and in the\r\n\r\nmost hesitant manner plodded over the whole field  of\r\n\r\npossible  taxation undecided where to cast  his  net.\r\n\r\nLike   a  butterfly - one  of  those  strange  Scottish\r\n\r\nvarieties  with hobnailed boots - he flitted  from  one\r\n\r\nsource of revenue to another, finally coming to  rest\r\n\r\nto sip at liquor, petrol and estate duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having stated that he estimated a deficit of $22\r\n\r\nmillions in 1956 at the old taxation levels, he  then\r\n\r\nintroduced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures  likely  to  yield  only  $7\ufffd  millions   and\r\n\r\ncommented, \"The balance, when its size becomes clear,\r\n\r\nwill have to be met from reserves or else covered  by\r\n\r\nincreased  taxation.\" Sir, the words \"when  its  size\r\n\r\nbecomes  clear\"  are  a  dire  confession  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  vision  of  the  financial  future   is\r\n\r\nclouded,  myopic and, as I have said,  uncertain  and\r\n\r\nthat  uncertainty  is  precisely  what  needs  to  be\r\n\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we to think of a fiscal policy and its\r\n\r\neffect  on the economy of the country which  says  in\r\n\r\nshort,  \"We  might double the rate of income  tax  or\r\n\r\ncompany  tax during the course of the next year;  or,\r\n\r\nof  course,  we might impose a purchase  tax  at  the\r\n\r\npoint  of import, only we have not made up our  minds\r\n\r\nwhether  it  will  work;  or  we  might  follow   the\r\n\r\nFederation tax on tobacco, but actually we  have  not\r\n\r\nthe  courage at the moment because it would  lose  us\r\n\r\ntoo  many  votes?\" This is not the way to  restore  a\r\n\r\nbadly  shaken  confidence in the present Government's\r\n\r\nability to govern. This is not the way to hasten  the\r\n\r\nflow  of capital into new industries. It is, in fact,\r\n\r\na  complete  negation  of the promise  given  in  His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the Governor's speech that  \"the  maximum\r\n\r\nencouragement  will  be offered  to  both  local  and\r\n\r\noverseas investors\", and a neglect of what should  be\r\n\r\nthe  central  objective of the Government's  economic\r\n\r\npolicy, namely, to expand the national income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, in fact, has happened? The Government has\r\n\r\nbroken  its promises by introducing indirect taxation\r\n\r\nwhich  falls on rich and poor alike. Call  samsu  and\r\n\r\nstout  a  luxury if you please, but do not deny  that\r\n\r\nthese  in  Singapore are largely  the  poor  people's\r\n\r\ndrinks  and  by  taxing them still further,  you  are\r\n\r\nplacing a greater burden on the poor man's pocket. In\r\n\r\ntaxing  liquor,  it  is very much  open  to  question\r\n\r\nwhether  the  increase in revenue hoped for  will  be\r\n\r\nrealised and whether diminished consumption will  not\r\n\r\nbe  the  result. I would remind the House, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe estimated revenue from liquor in 1954 amounted to\r\n\r\n$21 millions, but the final amount collected came  to\r\n\r\nabout $1 million less. In 1955 the revenue is likely,\r\n\r\naccording to the revised estimates, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrise  again to nearly $21 millions, showing that  the\r\n\r\nfalling-off in consumption in 1954 has been partially\r\n\r\nrectified.  Whether the increase this year  has  been\r\n\r\npartly the result of jubilation at the Labour Front's\r\n\r\nelection victory or the drowning of sorrows  at  this\r\n\r\ndisastrous event depends on one's point of view,  but\r\n\r\nit  seems  hardly a practical move to tax a commodity\r\n\r\nthe  consumption of which must be close to its  peak,\r\n\r\nand  I venture to predict that the Hon. the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary will not obtain the $4\ufffd millions extra yield\r\n\r\nwhich  he  is  hoping for. In fact, I  believe  I  am\r\n\r\ncorrect  in saying that the tax had to be reduced  on\r\n\r\nstill  wines  a year or two ago because of  a  marked\r\n\r\nfalling-off  in consumption, and that after  the  tax\r\n\r\nwas  reduced, consumption began to rise. This  is  an\r\n\r\nindication  of  the precarious ground  on  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is treading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to petrol, while it can be maintained that\r\n\r\nan  increase  in tax only affects the car  owner  and\r\n\r\nthat  this  source  of revenue is still  particularly\r\n\r\nbuoyant,  nevertheless, it should be remembered  that\r\n\r\n60  per  cent of the cars on the island are below  11\r\n\r\nhorse-power  and are owned by middle  class  people.\r\n\r\nSay   what  you  will,  the  imposition  of  indirect\r\n\r\ntaxation  does  not  place  the  burden  of  taxation\r\n\r\nsquarely on the shoulders of those best able to  bear\r\n\r\nit,  which  the  Government has stated  to  be  their\r\n\r\ntaxation policy, but in some form or another it  must\r\n\r\naffect  the  poorer  classes as  well.  It  is  sheer\r\n\r\nwriggling  on  the  part of the Government  to  shift\r\n\r\ntheir  ground from their stated policy and to try  to\r\n\r\nobscure  a broken promise by talk of luxuries,  quite\r\n\r\napart from the inconsistency of not taxing cigarettes\r\n\r\nor   champagne   which,   I   hardly   suppose,   are\r\n\r\nnecessities.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I leave the revenue side and\r\n\r\nconsider expenditure, there are at least three points\r\n\r\nmissing  from  the  Hon. the  Financial  Secretary's\r\n\r\nspeech  which should have been made, in  my  opinion,\r\n\r\nand  regarding  which  we  shall  hope  to  have   an\r\n\r\nassurance before the close of this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that we shall learn how many millions of\r\n\r\ndollars are being lost to the Treasury through income\r\n\r\ntax evasion,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat practical steps are being taken by Government to\r\n\r\ncombat it, and what extra revenue vigorous action  of\r\n\r\nthis sort can be expected to yield in the next year;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that the Government is fully aware that\r\n\r\nthe cardinal basis of its economic policy must be the\r\n\r\nexpansion of the national income, that the Government\r\n\r\nwill  not wreck any possibility of this expansion  by\r\n\r\nbeing evasive and mysterious as to whether or not  it\r\n\r\nis  proposed  to  increase the rates  of  income  tax\r\n\r\nduring the course of the year if the Federation  will\r\n\r\nfall in line;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, that, on the contrary, it will carry out\r\n\r\nits  declared policy of encouraging investment,  both\r\n\r\nlocally  and  from  overseas,  by  such  methods   as\r\n\r\nallowing  income  tax  relief's,  both  initial   and\r\n\r\nannual,  on  the  cost  of factory  construction  and\r\n\r\ninitial  plant  and  ensuring that such  construction\r\n\r\ngoes  ahead  with  the least possible  administrative\r\n\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in this way can the Government restore\r\n\r\nconfidence  to  the country, create conditions  which\r\n\r\nwill  give buoyancy to our revenues in 1956 and  also\r\n\r\nin  1957, and bring hope of work to the growing  army\r\n\r\nof  unemployed, on which vital subject the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary was singularly silent. As long ago as  June\r\n\r\nlast, the Hon. the Chief Minister informed this House\r\n\r\nthat  an Industrial Development Corporation was being\r\n\r\nset  up,  and  it still seems to be in the  realm  of\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed a most extraordinary move for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to range over the whole realm of taxation,\r\n\r\nstating  not only what can and cannot be  taxed,  but\r\n\r\nwhat  might or might not be taxed in the middle of  a\r\n\r\nfinancial  year,  almost like a  Budget  leakage  six\r\n\r\nmonths  in  advance.  Normal  practice  is  for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  announce its taxation policy  at  the\r\n\r\nBudget  session, it being understood that this policy\r\n\r\nholds  good  without  alteration for  twelve  months,\r\n\r\nunless, of course, some very severe financial  crisis\r\n\r\nwere  to  haste the country which required  immediate\r\n\r\naction.  A  deficit of 15 odd million dollars,  which\r\n\r\nmay turn out not to be a deficit at all, cannot claim\r\n\r\nto  be  a  critical position in view of the country's\r\n\r\nreserves. In our view, therefore, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  only unorthodox finance but undesirable  finance\r\n\r\nat  this  stage  to  hint that  there  may  be  extra\r\n\r\ntaxation in the course of the financial year. Such  a\r\n\r\npolicy   is  an  encouragement  to  speculators   and\r\n\r\nhoarders and reveals that the Government has no  firm\r\n\r\nline  of  its  own,  and this lack of  confidence  is\r\n\r\npassed on to the country where it gets magnified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my hon. Friend failed significantly to indicate\r\n\r\nwhat constructive measures the Government proposes to\r\n\r\ntake to increase the revenue of the country, clouding\r\n\r\nthe position over with hints of untimely taxation, he\r\n\r\nwas  equally evasive on the question of economies  in\r\n\r\nthe  realm  of  expenditure.  It  is  true  that   he\r\n\r\nmentioned   that   requests   from   Ministries   and\r\n\r\ndepartments had been pruned by $21 millions as far as\r\n\r\ndevelopment was concerned. It is true that he  stated\r\n\r\nthat  all  applications  for  new  appointments  were\r\n\r\nexamined.  But these are annual events and cannot  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as economies. I am mindful of the words  of\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the  Chief Minister in his speech  on  His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the Governor's Address in April  of  this\r\n\r\nyear when he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A short acquaintance with Government does seem to\r\n\r\nindicate that we are apt in many spheres to live on a\r\n\r\nsomewhat  extravagant scale, and we  intend  to  take\r\n\r\naction  shortly to bring about a realisation  by  the\r\n\r\nDepartments of the important need for economy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may have been a careful examination by\r\n\r\nMinisters  to  see  whether  a  new  appointment   is\r\n\r\nnecessary,  but  what  attempt  has  been   made   to\r\n\r\neliminate  waste in materials, or to  lower  building\r\n\r\ncosts through a re-examination of our standards?  The\r\n\r\nHon. the  Financial Secretary hinted that  something\r\n\r\nought  to  be done about it in the future,  but  this\r\n\r\nkind  of vagueness is not what one would expect  from\r\n\r\nthe Government, which has, after all, been over seven\r\n\r\nmonths   in  office.  That  the  Government  is   not\r\n\r\ncompletely  wholehearted  in  its  desire   to   make\r\n\r\neconomies  seems  evident  from  the  failure   after\r\n\r\nseveral  months to set up an Estimates  Committee  of\r\n\r\nthis  House.  Owing  to  the  non-existence  of  this\r\n\r\nCommittee,  I  hope, Sir that you will permit  me  to\r\n\r\nquote  one  example of what I mean  with  the  barest\r\n\r\nminimum of figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36 primary schools in Group A of the Education\r\n\r\nDevelopment Budget cost $240,000 each to  build,  and\r\n\r\nthese are almost completed. If I read the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  correctly,  the  Government  is  about  to\r\n\r\nlaunch  on  18 schools in Group B in 1956, and  these\r\n\r\nare   calculated  at  cost  $250,000  each,   or   an\r\n\r\nadditional  $10,000 per school. Has any  effort  been\r\n\r\nmade by the Minister or the Council of Ministers,  in\r\n\r\nthe absence of an Estimates Committee, to see whether\r\n\r\nperfectly satisfactory primary school buildings could\r\n\r\nnot  be  completed for, say, $200,000, which  I  have\r\n\r\nreason  to  believe is not impossible? If the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nhas  been  able  to  construct  apartment  blocks  at\r\n\r\nconsiderably lower costs than was thought possible  a\r\n\r\nfew  years  ago, why is the same not  being  done  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  schools? A saving of  the  type  I  have\r\n\r\nindicated would reduce the cost of the 1956  building\r\n\r\nprogramme under this head alone by approximately\r\n\r\n$900,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply this principle to other departments, in\r\n\r\nparticular to the Medical Department, and within  the\r\n\r\nrevenue  available,  I  am  convinced  that  we   can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to increase our social services at  a  more\r\n\r\nrapid  rate  than  that indicated in  the  Estimates.\r\n\r\nReductions  of  this  nature today,  streamlining  in\r\n\r\npersonnel and running costs, would give a chance  for\r\n\r\nthe revenue of the country to increase simultaneously\r\n\r\nwith  the  growth of the national income, instead  of\r\n\r\nbeing out of step with it, thus making heavy taxation\r\n\r\nnot  only  a  necessity but also an almost inevitable\r\n\r\nboomerang.  But  instead of Ministers devoting  their\r\n\r\nattention to this vital matter, what do we  find?  We\r\n\r\nfind  that  the  Council of Ministers, between  them,\r\n\r\nhave  been provided in the Estimates with  a  sum  of\r\n\r\n$31,800  for entertainment during 1956 and  that  the\r\n\r\nsix  Elected Ministers are to have provided to  their\r\n\r\nown  offices, transport and travelling,  the  sum  of\r\n\r\n$28,490.  The  point  is that this  Budget  has  been\r\n\r\ndubbed  an  austerity  Budget.  Projects  have   been\r\n\r\nabandoned  because  money is not available,  and  yet\r\n\r\nover  $60,000  is  to  be  voted  to  Ministers   for\r\n\r\nentertainment  and  transport expenses.  To  say  the\r\n\r\nleast, this is setting an undesirable example.

Equally clearly the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary should have some allowance, but  not\r\n\r\non  the  scale  that has been customary  in  previous\r\n\r\nyears  now  that he holds, if I may say  so,  a  less\r\n\r\nexalted  position. If extravagance of  this  sort  is\r\n\r\npermissible  at  the highest levels, one  can  hardly\r\n\r\nexpect  economies  in the departments  of  government\r\n\r\nthemselves.  We on this side of the House  very  much\r\n\r\ndeprecate  the  provision  of  these  perquisites  of\r\n\r\noffice  and we shall move amendments on each occasion\r\n\r\nin the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee of Supply unless the Government agrees to a\r\n\r\nvery drastic revision of this sum of $60,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must now touch briefly on certain main heads of\r\n\r\nexpenditure where we disagree with Government  policy\r\n\r\nand where, in two cases, we note with regret that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  failed entirely  to  carry  out  its\r\n\r\npromises.  I  must  refer you to His  Excellency  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's speech of April last which laid  down  the\r\n\r\npolicy of Government for the ensuing year:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Community Centre scheme will be developed and\r\n\r\nmore  facilities  provided  for  the  underprivileged\r\n\r\nyouths of Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But  what  do we find when we turn to the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates?  Token  votes  only  for  three  community\r\n\r\ncentres,  for youth holiday camps and for a Home  for\r\n\r\nHandicapped  Children;  in other  words,  a  complete\r\n\r\nfailure  to tackle these important projects.  In  the\r\n\r\nrealm  of  Medical  and  Health  His  Excellency  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's speech made this promise:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government will expand all medical and health\r\n\r\nservices,  including  the establishment  of  district\r\n\r\nhospitals.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  voiced  our  misgivings regarding the Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  towards the expansion of the medical services\r\n\r\nseven months ago, and it is unfortunately quite clear\r\n\r\nthat  our fears have been realised. The plan  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government, which it has  been  fashionable\r\n\r\nfor  the hon. Members to castigate as the Progressive\r\n\r\nGovernment,  was  to  provide ten cottage  hospitals,\r\n\r\nfive  in  the urban area and five in the rural  area,\r\n\r\nbut  this highly desirable scheme has apparently  now\r\n\r\nbeen  abandoned  altogether. Furthermore,  while  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Health   recently   made   a   Press\r\n\r\nannouncement that a new $3\ufffd million district hospital\r\n\r\nwas  to be built on the old Kallang Airport site,  he\r\n\r\nforgot  to  mention the important fact  that  no  new\r\n\r\nprovision for it has been made in the 1956 Estimates,\r\n\r\nand this project is therefore only a paper one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the general plan of the Government regarding\r\n\r\nthe  expansion of the medical services? The chief one\r\n\r\nwould  seem to be the building of a $2 million  urban\r\n\r\nhealth centre, 75 per cent of which will, in fact, be\r\n\r\npaid for from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColonial  and Development Welfare Fund. This  is  the\r\n\r\nyear's  main project, but unfortunately it  will  not\r\n\r\nadd immediately to the existing medical services,  as\r\n\r\nit  is  a  teaching centre and not intended primarily\r\n\r\nfor  treatment.  For  the rest,  most  of  the  funds\r\n\r\navailable  are to be spent on altering and  improving\r\n\r\nwards   in  existing  hospitals - always  an  expensive\r\n\r\nbusiness.   Surely  the  proper  policy - and   it   is\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party policy - is to get  on  as  fast  as\r\n\r\npossible  with  decentralisation? Surely  the  proper\r\n\r\npriority was to allocate sufficient funds to  get  on\r\n\r\nwith  the  building  of  the new  district  hospital,\r\n\r\nleaving the improvements to the General Hospital to a\r\n\r\nlater date if they still turn out to be necessary? We\r\n\r\nare extremely dissatisfied that so little progress is\r\n\r\nto  be  made in the direction of decentralisation  of\r\n\r\nthe  medical  services. So much for the  Government's\r\n\r\nefforts in the realm of health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to education, the Government is at least\r\n\r\nconsistent.  Having  ignored secondary  education  in\r\n\r\ntoto in His Excellency the Governor's speech, it  has\r\n\r\ncontinued to ignore it in the 1956 Estimates. It  has\r\n\r\ngiven  no new provision for this purpose, but only  a\r\n\r\nrevote sufficient to meet the building of two schools\r\n\r\nwhich should have been completed this year. This is a\r\n\r\ndismal  fact,  in  direct contrast to  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education's statement in this House only\r\n\r\na  fortnight  ago  that  the  six  secondary  schools\r\n\r\nprovided for in the 1955 Estimates would be built  in\r\n\r\n1956,  which  has turned out to be a  somewhat  empty\r\n\r\npromise.  Worse still, although a sum of $20 millions\r\n\r\nhas been set aside, quite rightly, in my opinion, for\r\n\r\ngrants-in-aid to vernacular schools, there is no sign\r\n\r\nin  the  Estimates  of  any recasting  of  the  whole\r\n\r\neducational  system  and no reorientation - and  I  use\r\n\r\nthat  word  deliberately - in plans. We shall  consider\r\n\r\nthe Government's education programme in detail in the\r\n\r\nCommittee of Supply and, though I shall say  no  more\r\n\r\ntoday, it seems to me to be most disappointing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to Public Works. Under this head, I will\r\n\r\nreserve  most of my comments for the Committee  stage\r\n\r\nand refer only to one point. We find that in the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Financial Secretary's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeech and in the Estimates very little reference  is\r\n\r\nmade to the question of flood alleviation. The latter\r\n\r\nshows  a vote of $123,000 to complete only the  Bedok\r\n\r\nscheme, while the former mentioned, in passing,  that\r\n\r\nout  of  a  sum of $35 millions which would  probably\r\n\r\nhave  to  be borrowed in 1956, $5 millions  would  be\r\n\r\nneeded for flood alleviation, housing loans, etc.  In\r\n\r\nthe  Sessional  Paper  on the Draft  Estimates  flood\r\n\r\nalleviation   was  referred  to  as  a  miscellaneous\r\n\r\ncommitment.  As I have said, it has been lumped  with\r\n\r\nhousing  loans and other unspecified items. I submit,\r\n\r\nSir,  that this is not proper budgeting. We  on  this\r\n\r\nside  of the House want to know, and the public  want\r\n\r\nto  know, what are Government's precise plans in this\r\n\r\nimportant  matter and we are not satisfied  with  its\r\n\r\nbeing  pushed  into a rag-bag of odds  and  ends  and\r\n\r\ncalled a miscellaneous commitment. Nevertheless,  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the  Government does not propose  to  use\r\n\r\nvigorous  and  immediate  measures  to  tackle   this\r\n\r\nimportant  problem comes as no surprise, in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  recent statement of the Minister in charge  that\r\n\r\nflood  alleviation would cost an awful lot  of  money\r\n\r\nand   there  was  none  to  spare,  and  anyway   the\r\n\r\nexceptional  rains of last year were  being  repeated\r\n\r\nonly  after  60  or 70 years or so and  could  hardly\r\n\r\nhappen  again in the immediate future. As far as  the\r\n\r\nviolence   of  the  monsoon  is  concerned,   it   is\r\n\r\nincredibly unwise to place one's faith in the law  of\r\n\r\naverages.  As  the development of land  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nproceeds  apace, the run-off of rain  water  is  more\r\n\r\nrapid  and  as each year passes, smaller and  smaller\r\n\r\nstorms  of shorter and shorter duration will  produce\r\n\r\nthe same flood conditions as today, and therefore, of\r\n\r\ncourse,   they   will   recur  more   frequently.   A\r\n\r\nshortsighted,  do-nothing policy  regarding  flooding\r\n\r\nwill not do. As things are at the moment, the farmers\r\n\r\nand the vegetable growers are to suffer more frequent\r\n\r\ndestruction  of  their crops and  the  town  dwellers\r\n\r\nconsequently are to pay more for their vegetables. If\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  living  is to be  kept  down  and  the\r\n\r\ndevastation  of wide areas of land and  its  valuable\r\n\r\ntop  soil  be avoided, a comprehensive three-year  or\r\n\r\nfive-year plan to tackle flood alleviation must start\r\n\r\nat once, and the Government must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot shirk its responsibility in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, Sir, sum up as briefly as I can what are our\r\n\r\nmain objections to this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Hon. the Financial Secretary hedged\r\n\r\nround  an  unconvincing Budget with reservations  and\r\n\r\ncontradictions.  On the one hand, he  stated  that  a\r\n\r\ndeficit  of  $22  millions less $7\ufffd  millions  to  be\r\n\r\nraised by extra taxation was not a fictitious figure.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, he said \"It is possible that,  by\r\n\r\nthe  middle  of  the year, savings will  have  become\r\n\r\navailable  because  of the inability  of  the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department  to make the progress  expected  on\r\n\r\ncertain major items.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government has broken its promises by\r\n\r\nincreasing  indirect  taxation which  does  not  fall\r\n\r\nsolely on those best able to bear it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it has hinted at mid-year taxation of\r\n\r\neither  a  direct or indirect kind, which  creates  a\r\n\r\nlack   of  confidence,  encourages  speculators   and\r\n\r\nhoarders  because the types of likely  taxation  have\r\n\r\nbeen  revealed and is totally uncalled for  when  the\r\n\r\ncountry's finances are basically sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, it has failed to give an assurance that,\r\n\r\nwhatever  action  may  be  felt  necessary  regarding\r\n\r\npersonal tax in the future, company tax will be  left\r\n\r\nalone  so  as  to  stimulate  the  expansion  of  the\r\n\r\nnational income, the starting of new industries,  and\r\n\r\nof  giving  the growing army of unemployed  the  hope\r\n\r\nthat they can look forward to more jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, it has failed to examine the possibility of\r\n\r\nlowering  the standards of building, with  particular\r\n\r\nreference to the Education and Health departments, so\r\n\r\nthat  the  funds available can be made to stretch  as\r\n\r\nfar  as possible, and no Estimates Committee has been\r\n\r\nappointed for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, funds available have not been in all cases\r\n\r\nallotted to priority projects. The Head: Public Works\r\n\r\nNon-Recurrent  General  has  been  increased  by   $1\r\n\r\nmillion  over 1955 by items which are not of pressing\r\n\r\nimportance,   while   entertainment   and   transport\r\n\r\nallowances  to  Ministers at $60,000 is  not  a  good\r\n\r\nexample to set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventhly, certain Heads contain huge estimates of\r\n\r\nexpenditure,   for   example,   $5\ufffd  millions   for\r\n\r\nacquisition    and   development   of    sites    for\r\n\r\nresettlement, and nearly $6\ufffd millions  for  purchase\r\n\r\nof  land, with no breakdown figures whatever to  show\r\n\r\nhow these lump sums were arrived at and no indication\r\n\r\nthat  this intended acquisition or purchase has  been\r\n\r\ncorrelated with the Government building programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, inadequate consideration and provision have\r\n\r\nbeen given to flood alleviation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, therefore, we are not convinced that\r\n\r\nthe  revenue available is being allocated  so  as  to\r\n\r\nstretch  as  far  as  it possibly  can.  We  are  not\r\n\r\nsatisfied with Government's what-we-might-do-tomorrow\r\n\r\noutlook  in place of a firm what-we-shall-definitely-do-today  policy, and we regret that  the  Government\r\n\r\npays  no more than lip service to the principle  that\r\n\r\nthe  country  can  no  longer  plan  expansion  on  a\r\n\r\nchampagne basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it\r\n\r\nwould   appear   that  the  Labour  Front   Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment  has decided not to show its hand  in  the 1956 Budget  to  implement fully  the  socialisation\r\n\r\nprogrammes  which it promised the people  during  the\r\n\r\nelection.  As  it is, what we had from the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary on the 9th  of  November  was  a\r\n\r\nrehash  of  Budgets  of  previous  years,  with   the\r\n\r\nincreased  expenditure principally in  the  Education\r\n\r\nand  Health services. We wonder whether the  decision\r\n\r\nnot  to  depart from the tried and proven formula  is\r\n\r\ndue  to  want  of  courage or want  of  experience - we\r\n\r\nsuspect it is probably due to both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is, however, perturbed that, in the first year\r\n\r\nof  a  nearly popularly but now reduced to a minority\r\n\r\nelected  Government, the fiscal expert for the  first\r\n\r\ntime  promised  a  deficit  which  he  described  and\r\n\r\nemphasised  would  not  turn  out  to  be  a  surplus\r\n\r\neventually as in the preceding years, and he followed\r\n\r\non  and promised bigger and more substantial deficits\r\n\r\nin future years. His crystal ball showed a deficit of\r\n\r\n$40  millions in the year 1959, and therefore  he  is\r\n\r\nnow telling the people to tighten their belts and  to\r\n\r\nexpect more and bigger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxation  in  all quarters, ranging from  income  and\r\n\r\ncompany  taxes to luxury and purchase taxes, as  well\r\n\r\nas  other possible sale tax to be dreamt up  for  the\r\n\r\nelectorate. The prophet of doom has spoken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit, it is for the people to ask Government\r\n\r\nwhat other ways and means it has at their disposal to\r\n\r\nincrease  national income, other  than  the  levy  of\r\n\r\nbigger and higher taxes. One has no need, I hope,  to\r\n\r\nremind  Government of the law of diminishing  return.\r\n\r\nSooner  or  later, one will be taxed out of existence\r\n\r\nif  Government were to stand still, fold up its  hand\r\n\r\nand  expect miracles to happen. The people would feel\r\n\r\nmuch  happier if Government would turn its  attention\r\n\r\nto  the curbing of the rising cost of government. The\r\n\r\nfigure  for  the  civil  service  for  1956  is   $98\r\n\r\nmillions,  which  is three times  that  of  1949  and\r\n\r\nnearly  twice  that of 1952. Ways and means  must  be\r\n\r\nfound  to  stop this spectacular rise, and efficiency\r\n\r\nstepped  up in Government services to save taxpayers'\r\n\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one examines the Budget in closer detail, it is\r\n\r\nobvious that Government may not be very confident  of\r\n\r\nits  ability to ferret out tax evaders, as  surely  a\r\n\r\nvery  small  percentage of the  people  are  actually\r\n\r\npaying income tax in full?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the item under Broadcasting, one is aware that up\r\n\r\nto  31st  October, 1955, 39,619 radios and radiograms\r\n\r\nhad  been imported. Against this figure, only  11,285\r\n\r\nsets  were exported, leaving a net balance of  28,334\r\n\r\nsets  for sale in Singapore only. Yet Government does\r\n\r\nnot  envisage  any  substantial increase  in  revenue\r\n\r\nderived from the sale of radio licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, in order to find the money to meet the cost\r\n\r\nof  social services, the economy of this country must\r\n\r\nfirst expand and prosper, resulting in an increase of\r\n\r\nnational   income.   Trade  and  industry   must   be\r\n\r\nencouraged   to  produce  a  healthy   and   economic\r\n\r\nstructure  that  will  in  turn  produce  dollars.  A\r\n\r\nclimate of political stability free from strikes must\r\n\r\nbe  attained, and that the Government has  failed  to\r\n\r\ndo.  Instead  of flights of capital,  we  would  have\r\n\r\nhoped for influx of capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would be assured of the future of Singapore and\r\n\r\nMalaya  if  Government  would  introduce  schemes  to\r\n\r\nassist new light and secondary industries. Reasonable\r\n\r\nincome  tax  concessions for new industries  must  be\r\n\r\nintroduced.   Industrial  research  and   development\r\n\r\ncentres under Government auspices should be built  to\r\n\r\nhelp  young  industrial enterprises to  compete  with\r\n\r\nforeign  goods.  Government must be ready  to  remove\r\n\r\nobstacles  and administrative red tape  in  approving\r\n\r\nnew  factory  schemes  so  as  to  avoid  unnecessary\r\n\r\ndelays.  Unless  Government takes the initiative  and\r\n\r\nhas  a positive approach to the economy of Singapore,\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid it will find it more difficult year  by\r\n\r\nyear  to  produce balanced Budgets, which we know  is\r\n\r\nthe   first  requisite  of  the  sound  economy   and\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as to its final decision to increase tax on\r\n\r\nliquor  and  petrol, the Government shows a  singular\r\n\r\nlack   of   consistency.  We  were  told  they   were\r\n\r\nfrustrated  by  the  Federation  Government  in   the\r\n\r\nlevying  of  a  direct  tax on income,  and  we  were\r\n\r\nfurther told that they were similarly frustrated when\r\n\r\nthey considered tax on luxuries. But now we are faced\r\n\r\nwith the fact that tax will be increased on samsu and\r\n\r\nbeer -  the  poor  man's  drinks - and  the  rich  man's\r\n\r\nchampagne,  gin and rum have been left out untouched.\r\n\r\nWe  were  also told that the Government, for want  of\r\n\r\ncourage,  did not increase the tax on cigarettes  and\r\n\r\ntobacco,  which are hardly necessities, but there  is\r\n\r\nnow  an  increase  in the tax on petrol  which  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessity. We were left with no other conclusion than\r\n\r\nthat this Government has no fixed fiscal policy,  and\r\n\r\nwe  sympathise with those people who are singled  out\r\n\r\nto be penalised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also touch at this time on the expenditure\r\n\r\non  Education.  We note with approval the  fact  that\r\n\r\neducational programmes are receiving more  and  prior\r\n\r\nattention,    as   evidenced   by   the    increasing\r\n\r\nappropriations each year. This is a proper  trend  as\r\n\r\nthe  education of this country's children is  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst  importance  in the building of  a  democratic,\r\n\r\nindependent  Malayan  nation. The  emphasis  on  this\r\n\r\ncannot   be   over-exaggerated.  We   are,   however,\r\n\r\nparticularly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterested in the proportionate distribution  of  the\r\n\r\nfunds  for  schools of all communities, as  from  the\r\n\r\nappropriations,  one can tell Government's  intention\r\n\r\nas  to  the different types of schools. We are deeply\r\n\r\ninterested  in  the  attitude of  Government  towards\r\n\r\nChinese education and Chinese schools, whether it  is\r\n\r\ntheir   intention  to  raise  its  position  in   the\r\n\r\neducation  scheme  of Singapore. The  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nbiggest  number of taxpayers in Singapore  today  are\r\n\r\nChinese   would   justify  an  equitable   and   fair\r\n\r\ndistribution  for the education of  those  who  would\r\n\r\nmuch  prefer to be educated, firstly, in the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage. From the Budget, we note that there  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease of $10 millions which has been earmarked  as\r\n\r\ngrant-in-aid for the Chinese schools. We will reserve\r\n\r\nour  comment on this to a later time, when the report\r\n\r\non Chinese education is tabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the school building programme that the\r\n\r\nGovernment is embarking on next year, we note that  2\r\n\r\nsecondary  and 18 primary schools will  be  built  in\r\n\r\n1956. We would very much like to be enlightened as to\r\n\r\nhow  many  of  these  are  Chinese  schools,  English\r\n\r\nschools, Malay schools and Indian schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

Jumabhoy:</b> Can we, for instance, Sir, ask what\r\n\r\nis  happening  to  our  United States  hard  currency\r\n\r\nearnings? We have asked about this, but we have never\r\n\r\ngot  a satisfactory reply. Can we, for instance,  ask\r\n\r\nwhy  such  a  large  amount of our revenue  is  being\r\n\r\ndrained  away  by the expatriates? Can we  also  ask,\r\n\r\nSir,  why  a large amount of capital by European  and\r\n\r\nother  firms  is  being sent  away  in  the  form  of\r\n\r\ndividends? Can it not be kept in this country?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking at this Budget, one could see that\r\n\r\nexpenditure is going higher year by year, and in this\r\n\r\nyear's  Budget  expenditure is the highest.  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nSessional  Paper No. Cmd. 28 of 1955,  page  12,  the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Financial Secretary has  said  that  \"with\r\n\r\nregard  to  the future, revenue is tending  to  level\r\n\r\noff.\"  Well,  Sir, he is not optimistic about  future\r\n\r\nrevenue whilst expenditure is mounting up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the natural resources of this Colony, I\r\n\r\nhave  time  and  again pointed out that  we  have  no\r\n\r\nnatural   resources   whatsoever   like   any   other\r\n\r\ncountries, or even like what the Federation has  got.\r\n\r\nSir,  we live on our entrepot trade and that is  also\r\n\r\nlimited  because,  as time goes on, the  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries will naturally be getting imports from  the\r\n\r\nsource of production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the other hand, Port Swettenham and Penang\r\n\r\nare being developed with more harbour facilities, and\r\n\r\nif  rubber and tin are to be exported direct from the\r\n\r\nFederation, where do we stand?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that we must develop the cottage\r\n\r\nindustry,  which is a good thing for  the  housewife.\r\n\r\nBut   can  we  develop  large-scale  industries  like\r\n\r\nHongkong? Can we do that? Let us compare Hongkong and\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In Hongkong there are no strikes.  Their\r\n\r\nincome  tax, I believe, is about 12\ufffd per  cent.  They\r\n\r\ncan  produce things cheaper. Let us compare Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  other  countries. We have got to  compete  with\r\n\r\nother  countries like Japan and Germany in industrial\r\n\r\ngoods. Sir, prewar, Japan used to sell its shirts in\r\n\r\nthe London market, even right in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManchester. Now, while we are still in peacetime,  we\r\n\r\ncan   compete   only  if  we  are   to   produce   by\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  cheaper. In our  present  position,  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether we can compete at all. I do not  think\r\n\r\nindustrialists will invest money here unless they can\r\n\r\ncompete   in  selling  the  same  article  as   other\r\n\r\ncountries.  Sir,  the main factor  in  production  is\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace. Have we got it here? Well,  I  can\r\n\r\nrecollect  that  the  Chief  Minister  said  that  he\r\n\r\nwelcomed  the  strikes.  And who  is  responsible - the\r\n\r\npresent Coalition?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not allowed to utilise our hand currency\r\n\r\nearnings  for  our  own benefit.  It  is  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  who takes it away. We cannot keep. If  these\r\n\r\nhard currency earnings were to be kept by us for  our\r\n\r\nown  benefit, then our dollar would be much  stronger\r\n\r\nthan  even  the  United States dollar.  We  have  got\r\n\r\nplenty of our reserves in hard currency which is  not\r\n\r\nbeing utilised for ourselves. Can we have a say about\r\n\r\nit?  We  cannot. We have no right to it. I have  been\r\n\r\nasking about this, year after year, but no steps have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  that  we should utilise  these  currency\r\n\r\nearnings for our own sake. Suppose we were to utilise\r\n\r\nit  ourselves  to  import  goods  direct  instead  of\r\n\r\nthrough the United Kingdom, we would have got  things\r\n\r\ncheaper  for our own people. On the other hand,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  are  allowed to import hard currency  goods  from\r\n\r\nHongKong by paying more in Malayan dollars, and also\r\n\r\nthereby  enabling  the  Hongkong  importer  to   make\r\n\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of our revenue is being drained away by\r\n\r\nthe  expatriates  in  the way  of  salaries,  passage\r\n\r\nleaves  and  pensions. Can we do anything  about  it?\r\n\r\nThis  has been going on for about 134 years.  We  are\r\n\r\ntold  that they have done good. Well, they are  being\r\n\r\npaid  to do good. They have got to serve. It is their\r\n\r\nduty.  But  have they done any good by drawing  these\r\n\r\nhuge  salaries, barring out at least 90 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe local people from the top jobs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about trade. What are we doing to keep our\r\n\r\ncapital  in this country? As one of the hon.  Members\r\n\r\non  my  side  has said - I think it was the Member  for\r\n\r\nSeletar - most of our savings are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing  invested, even by banks, in places other  than\r\n\r\nSingapore,  where their earnings come from.  You  can\r\n\r\nsave a lot - set up savings societies and so on - but the\r\n\r\nfirst   thing  should  be  that  people   must   have\r\n\r\nconfidence in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said about entertainment expenditure.\r\n\r\nI do not think I will dwell much on that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, see what happens in the free countries.\r\n\r\nTake India for example.

Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> So, out of a total, Sir, for a\r\n\r\nwhole year, $31,300 has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen   budgeted   for  by  the   City   Council   for\r\n\r\nentertainment and expenditure to date is  $24,550.  I\r\n\r\nhave  not heard, Sir, this man Chan Kum Chee, or  any\r\n\r\nof  his Progressive friends, attack the entertainment\r\n\r\nallowance  in the City Council. As you are  no  doubt\r\n\r\naware,  Sir, though we have extended the life of  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council, the majority of its members  are  from\r\n\r\nthe  Progressive Party. And it seems  that  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil may spend $31,300, but the Government of  the\r\n\r\ncountry,  Sir, cannot spend even less than  that  for\r\n\r\nentertainment expenses. Now, Sir, that is the kind of\r\n\r\nconduct which seems to me to reflect not only on  the\r\n\r\nParty  that seeks to attack the Government for making\r\n\r\nmoderate  provision for essential entertainment,  but\r\n\r\nit  also brings into disrepute the entire concept  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to draw attention, Sir, to certain\r\n\r\nfacts about this question of entertainment allowance.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  there  is allocated  to  me  as  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister a sum of $10,000. Now, I do not get that  as\r\n\r\npart of my emoluments. I do not touch a single dollar\r\n\r\nof that money. That money is merely a provision for a\r\n\r\ncontingency.  The way we work it in  the  Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters,  Sir, is that bills must be  submitted  to\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Financial Secretary, who must  satisfy\r\n\r\nhimself that the occasion is an appropriate one for a\r\n\r\nGovernment  function  and  he  must  pay  the   bills\r\n\r\nhimself. The Minister sometimes pays in advance,  but\r\n\r\nwhen  he  submits  the  bill he  gets  just  what  is\r\n\r\nindicated  on  it, so that it may well  be  that  the\r\n\r\n$10,000 is not spent or it may be overspent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think hon. Members may be interested to know just\r\n\r\nwhat types of entertainment have been given since  so\r\n\r\nmuch  stress has been laid on it. The first  occasion\r\n\r\nwas  the farewell party to Sir John Nicoll - the  first\r\n\r\noccasion  on which this Government had an opportunity\r\n\r\nto give a function, and it was the intention then not\r\n\r\nso  much  to  give a farewell party  as  to  give  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  the common man to get  to  know  his\r\n\r\nGovernment; and to that dinner, Sir, were invited not\r\n\r\nthe  Armed  Services or the Consular Corps,  who  get\r\n\r\ninvited to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall these functions, or the heads of departments, but\r\n\r\n683   persons,   consisting   of   trade   unionists,\r\n\r\nrepresentatives      of     youth      organisations,\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the Police and  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next function was one for Malcolm MacDonald at\r\n\r\nwhich  there were 4,000 people present and in respect\r\n\r\nof  which  every Member who was elected was given  an\r\n\r\nopportunity of inviting fifty of his constituents, so\r\n\r\nas  to  make  it possible for Mr. and Mrs. Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe people of this country, to take part in their own\r\n\r\nbusiness.  I  am proud of this, that we  have  broken\r\n\r\naway  from  the tradition of the past  and  that  the\r\n\r\nentertainment which has been given by this Government\r\n\r\nhas been predominantly for the people of this country\r\n\r\nand  at  which the people of this country  have  been\r\n\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, Sir, were a Chinese dinner party in honour\r\n\r\nof the Rt. Hon. Mr Lennox-Boyd, at which the Parties\r\n\r\nin  this Assembly were represented; a Chinese  dinner\r\n\r\nfor  the  Foreign Minister of Indonesia;  a  cocktail\r\n\r\nparty  for the Colombo Plan officials; a dinner party\r\n\r\nfor  the Colombo Plan Ministers, and lunches  to  the\r\n\r\nMinisters   of   the  Federation.  As  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommerce,   I   gave   a  lunch   to   the   Hongkong\r\n\r\nindustrialists,  who  organised  an   exhibition   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   and   also  to  certain   Indian   trade\r\n\r\ndelegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in every instance, the bills went forward\r\n\r\nto  the Hon. the Financial Secretary and there was no\r\n\r\nquestion  either  of my receiving more  or  receiving\r\n\r\nless,  so that the $10,000 that is allocated  to  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister is not a fixed sum but is  one  which\r\n\r\nwill  vary  with the necessities of the occasions.  I\r\n\r\nfeel that it is more than a little cheap that a great\r\n\r\ncity  like Singapore, which permits its City  Council\r\n\r\nto  spend more than $31,300 on entertainment,  should\r\n\r\ntake  objection  in this fashion to  the  normal  and\r\n\r\nnecessary   expenditure  for  the  normal  courtesies\r\n\r\nextended  to visiting personalities and on  occasions\r\n\r\nof public importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we come to the question of transport, Sir. The\r\n\r\nsum represented there is the payment of a sum of $150\r\n\r\na month to Ministers. I myself pay $150 a month to my\r\n\r\ndriver, apart from the Provident Fund, apart from the\r\n\r\ninsurance,  apart  from the cost  of  the  car,  from\r\n\r\npetrol, and from repairs. But that is the sum we have\r\n\r\nfixed,  in  trying to be modest, in fact,  more  than\r\n\r\nmodest. You can quite appreciate, Sir, that if any of\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Members opposite were to be in my position,\r\n\r\nI  have  not the slightest doubt that they would  get\r\n\r\nthemselves Daimlers and liveried chauffeurs, and they\r\n\r\nwould  be  to some extent within the logic  of  their\r\n\r\npositions  in Singapore. The President  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil has a car and a livened chauffeur. You,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhave   a  car  and  a  liveried  chauffeur.  But   my\r\n\r\nGovernment  has been sincerely seeking to  achieve  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  standard of expenditure. It may  be,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  in some of the receptions of the past, we  have\r\n\r\nerred  a little. I have looked at it carefully and  I\r\n\r\nam  prepared to admit that, perhaps, they were  on  a\r\n\r\nlarge  scale, and I am certainly going to be a little\r\n\r\nmore  careful  in  the future; but to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  $31,000 a year for  entertainment  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  exaggerated  is,  with  respect,  Sir,\r\n\r\ndisgraceful. As regards the question of transport,  I\r\n\r\nchallenge  hon. Members opposite to suggest  that  it\r\n\r\ncould  be any less because I myself, Sir, have worked\r\n\r\nit  out.  I  believe that my normal  expenditure  for\r\n\r\ntransport is about $500 a month, but I take $150 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is for having a house in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Five cents on a gallon is supposed\r\n\r\nto  bear  very heavily on the poor man - five  cents  a\r\n\r\ngallon.  Any bus would do at least ten miles  to  the\r\n\r\ngallon;  so  half  a  cent a mile  for  about  twenty\r\n\r\npassengers - that, Sir, is dreadful imposition  on  the\r\n\r\npoor  by  way of indirect taxation. But in  the  same\r\n\r\nbreath  he  says,  \"Why  do you  not  put  a  tax  on\r\n\r\ntobacco?\"  That, Sir, according to Progressive  Party\r\n\r\nlogic,  is  not  indirect taxation. It  is  merely  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of what Government does is wrong  and  what\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  not  do is wrong.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  wants a tax on tobacco. Now,  Sir,  I  quite\r\n\r\nagree that in the ultimate analysis tobacco is not an\r\n\r\nessential commodity of life but it is the poor  man's\r\n\r\none  luxury and to some that are addicted to  it,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be very difficult for them to give it  up.  To\r\n\r\nput  a  tax on tobacco would mean to place  the  main\r\n\r\nburden  of  taxation on the middle class and  on  the\r\n\r\npoor  whom  we seek to protect, and if we cannot  tax\r\n\r\nthe rich, we will not tax the poor. It is no question\r\n\r\nof  timidity, Sir, it is a question of principle. The\r\n\r\nquestion of an imposition of a further tax on tobacco\r\n\r\nwill  come when more factories have sprung up locally\r\n\r\nto  manufacture cheaper cigarettes, so that the  poor\r\n\r\npeople  need not be deprived completely of their  one\r\n\r\nluxury  and  can  have  access  to  cheaper  locally-manufactured  cigarettes. We have that  in  mind.  It\r\n\r\nwill  come  when we can lay the burden, as we  should\r\n\r\nlay  the  burden,  by direct taxation  and,  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  it is curious to note that the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon (Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLim Choon Mong), who belongs to the same Party as the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanglin, could not have sufficient liaison\r\n\r\nbetween  them in order to speak the same language  on\r\n\r\nthe  same morning. The Member for Serangoon  was  all\r\n\r\nfor  direct  taxation  and increase  of  income  tax,\r\n\r\nforgetting  the shades of his President.  The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin,  Sir,  warned us that  we  must  reduce\r\n\r\ntaxation in order to attract capital to this country.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the type of criticism that a Budget,  which\r\n\r\nhas   received   the   greatest  and   most   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration  on  our part, has elicited  from  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Member for Tanglin and, I think,\r\n\r\nothers  as well have made a reference to the  general\r\n\r\nimpression  in the country about the inefficiency  of\r\n\r\nthe Income Tax Department. Sir, I do not suppose that\r\n\r\nthere  is a single Income Tax Department in any  part\r\n\r\nof  the world which is not charged by its public with\r\n\r\ninefficiency.  I  do not suppose that  there  is  any\r\n\r\ncountry  in  the  world where there is  not  material\r\n\r\nevasion of income tax but I would like to say  this - I\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  Member  for Tanglin  said  it  in  a\r\n\r\nconstructive spirit - that Government is very conscious\r\n\r\nof  this  public feeling and that Government is  very\r\n\r\nanxious   to  seek  to  strengthen  the  Income   Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment   for   the  purpose   of   dealing   more\r\n\r\nefficiently with existing tax evasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other matter, Sir. I would not take up\r\n\r\nmuch time. In view of the unexpected adjournment,  we\r\n\r\nare  very  short of time at the moment, but  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to say this on the attack made that we have been\r\n\r\nguilty of leakage of Budget secrets. That is a normal\r\n\r\npractice for Government to disclose its Budget policy\r\n\r\nand  not  the means by which it achieves that policy,\r\n\r\nbut  I think hon. Members opposite should stop for  a\r\n\r\nmoment  to realise this: what happened here, although\r\n\r\nnot normal practice it is quite true, was that we had\r\n\r\nto   meet   an   abnormal  situation,  because   this\r\n\r\nGovernment  is not in complete control of its  fiscal\r\n\r\npolicy.  We  are, to some extent. Sir,  tied  to  the\r\n\r\nchariot of the Federation and it is only proper,  out\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespect to this Assembly and no more, that it  should\r\n\r\nbe  aware  of the intent and the final decision.  The\r\n\r\nfinal decision, Sir, does not in any way indicate our\r\n\r\npolicy   as  such  if  it  were  divorced  from   the\r\n\r\nbackground of the means by which we have to  come  to\r\n\r\nthis compromise, which is not to our liking. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  it  was necessary to indicate what the decisions\r\n\r\nwere,  what the desires were, and what the  decisions\r\n\r\nultimately became.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanglin drew attention to a\r\n\r\nstatement  I made that we were very anxious  to  seek\r\n\r\ncurtailment  of Government expenditure. That  remains\r\n\r\ntrue,  and  directions have been given  to  heads  of\r\n\r\ndepartments,  and  I believe they have  been  loyally\r\n\r\ncomplied  with,  but I am still far  from  satisfied,\r\n\r\nSir,  not because there is any suspicion in  my  mind\r\n\r\nthat  I  have not received every assistance from  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  in  the effort to  bring  down  to  a\r\n\r\nminimum  the  expenditure in the various departments,\r\n\r\nbut because I think that the whole structure requires\r\n\r\na  comprehensive review by experts in order to assist\r\n\r\nin bringing down the expenditure of this country; and\r\n\r\nI  would  like to say this, Sir, that we have  sought\r\n\r\nthe assistance of the Government of India to send  us\r\n\r\nthree  men  who  are,  in  their  own  right,  Indian\r\n\r\nGovernment  experts on organisation  and  method.  We\r\n\r\nhave  asked  for them in the hope that we would  have\r\n\r\nthem  for at least one year so that they could review\r\n\r\nthe   position  and  make  recommendations  for   the\r\n\r\nreduction of expenditure and, at the same time, teach\r\n\r\nsome  of  our  local  civil  servants  the  procedure\r\n\r\nwhereby we can, in future, keep a constant check on a\r\n\r\nvery  natural  tendency, Sir, on the  part  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants - both expatriate and local - to  indulge  in  a\r\n\r\nbit of empire-building on their own. This goes on  in\r\n\r\nevery country in the world, and we do need experts in\r\n\r\norganisation  and method. Unfortunately,  the  Indian\r\n\r\nGovernment itself, Sir, has very great need of  these\r\n\r\nmen  and  they  have been unable to comply  with  our\r\n\r\nrequest. It is my intention to take it up again  with\r\n\r\nthe appropriate authorities in New Delhi when I visit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit early next month. I would like to say that I am by\r\n\r\nno means complacent about the sum - indicated, I think,\r\n\r\nby  the  leader of the Democratic Party (Mr  William\r\n\r\nTan) - of  $98  millions spent,  for  example,  on  the\r\n\r\nPersonal Emoluments of our civil servants. I  am  far\r\n\r\nfrom   complacent  about  the  expenditures  of   the\r\n\r\r\nGovernment. We have been seven months in office, Sir,\r\n\r\nand  this  sort  of axing is not done  in  a  day.  I\r\n\r\ncertainly  intend to pursue methods which I  have  in\r\n\r\nmind  for  greater  reduction in expenditure  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to end, Sir, by expressing regret that\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  opposite  have  not  seen  fit  on  an\r\n\r\noccasion  of  this  nature to make suggestions  of  a\r\n\r\nconstructive character that could assist  us  in  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  of  this  country,  instead   of   merely\r\n\r\nindulging in party politics from the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of all the\r\n\r\nsterile speeches we have heard this morning, I  think\r\n\r\nthe one by the Chief Minister about the entertainment\r\n\r\nexpenses  and travelling allowances of his  Ministers\r\n\r\nis about the most sterile of them all. It is a petty,\r\n\r\ncompletely irrelevant matter which has been raised by\r\n\r\npetty people and taken in an extremely serious manner\r\n\r\nby  the  Chief Minister who thought that  it  was  an\r\n\r\nattack  on  the integrity of his Government.  No  one\r\n\r\nsuggests,  for one moment, that his Ministers  fiddle\r\n\r\ntheir  expense accounts or do not show bills  to  the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Financial Secretary. The point  taken  was\r\n\r\nthat there should not be this extravagant example set\r\n\r\nby  Government Ministers. The most unfortunate  thing\r\n\r\nabout  today's debate is that the speech by the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister was concerned almost exclusively\r\n\r\nwith the entertainment allowances of City Councillors\r\n\r\nand  Members  of this Assembly, with their  transport\r\n\r\ndifficulties    and    their    personal    transport\r\n\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister has said that he has had\r\n\r\nno  constructive criticism coming from this  side  of\r\n\r\nthe  House.  It  was  probably because  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  did not choose to speak this  morning.\r\n\r\nHowever, whether he will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsider what we have to tell him as constructive  or\r\n\r\njust  the slinging of mud-pies and stones is a matter\r\n\r\nof which, I think, he is not the best judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been suggested that you\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  a judge of what is fair  and  unfair\r\n\r\nreporting  and  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister   has\r\n\r\nstrenuously  defended you. I would  like  to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat, at the end of the speeches for the day, what is\r\n\r\nfair or unfair, as said by the Opposition, should not\r\n\r\nbe  a  matter  which rests with the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the nature and character of a\r\n\r\ngovernment  is  not decided by florid and  flamboyant\r\n\r\ndeclarations of policy and intention. The final  test\r\n\r\nis   the  fiscal  policy  of  the  Government   which\r\n\r\ndetermines whether it is blue, light blue, light pink\r\n\r\nor  deep red. The Hon. the Chief Minister should  not\r\n\r\nhave  been  so  surprised that he found little  which\r\n\r\ncontradicted   his   Budget,   because   the   placid\r\n\r\nassumption of all the speeches made this morning was: \"It was a jolly good Budget and we got way with it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the Member for Tanglin Club - I beg his\r\n\r\npardon - the hon. Mr Sutherland - who could not  conceal\r\n\r\nhis  relief that he was not made to pay what was  his\r\n\r\ndue and fair share of the taxation of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Do not talk rubbish!

The Member for Serangoon  must  be\r\n\r\nvery  careful  about what he says. What he  expounded\r\n\r\nmeans, in effect, a Socialist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogramme,  which  would  startle  those   who   have\r\n\r\nsupported  and financed his Party. As for the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin,  he  is a more adroit businessman,  who\r\n\r\nshowed  all  the  skill  which  the  running  of  big\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  this Colony inculcates  in  a  business\r\n\r\nexecutive. References were made to the fact that  the\r\n\r\ntaxes were indirect. No reference was made as to  how\r\n\r\ntaxes should be raised in a direct and concrete form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William\r\n\r\nTan)  who was rather vague. He proposed that the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister should encourage local industry,\r\n\r\ntrade  and  commerce.  \"Do not  think  of  increasing\r\n\r\ntaxation,\"  says the leader of the Democratic  Party,\r\n\r\n\"but  think  of  increasing the  basis  of  taxation.\r\n\r\nIncrease  the  income and then, at the same  rate  of\r\n\r\ntax, you will have more money to run the government.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  the  Democratic Party will be happy, the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  will  be happy and the people will  be  happy.\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is  one  of  those attractive  propositions\r\n\r\nwhich,  no  doubt, if ever the Democratic  Party  and\r\n\r\ntheir  new-found  friends  in  the  Progressive  camp\r\n\r\nshould  form a government, we shall have the pleasure\r\n\r\nof watching them try to put into operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R.\r\n\r\nJumabhoy).  Now,  Sir, I have a particular  affection\r\n\r\nfor   the  hon.  Member.  In  the  sometimes   dreary\r\n\r\ndeliberations of this House, he brings a light touch.\r\n\r\nHe  brings  the  right  personal  touch.  He  is  not\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  taxation. He is concerned  with  the\r\n\r\ndire and deepening crisis in the constitution when he\r\n\r\nfinds  that the Chief Minister has only eleven  votes\r\n\r\nnow  and  he, on his side, has got fourteen.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhave  recently had several telephone calls  from  the\r\n\r\nMember for Telok Ayer, and he has been instructing me\r\n\r\non the merits and demerits of the constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I never thought much of the Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution  even after it had been revised  by  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Chief Minister. I will think much less of it\r\n\r\nif  it ever came to the stage where one could have  a\r\n\r\nconglomeration of opposing and naturally  fissiparous\r\n\r\nforces all bound together with only one ambition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- to share the spoils of office.

It is quite true that two of the people of  whom\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Chief Minister was once so very  proud\r\n\r\nwhen  he  said,  \"When I look at the Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition and I look behind me, I thank God for  the\r\n\r\nmen I have behind me\", -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Now, that  was  a  constructive\r\n\r\nspeech.  There we have someone who made proposals  as\r\n\r\nto  how the rural areas should be supplied with  more\r\n\r\nlibraries,  not the travelling type,  but  the  fixed\r\n\r\ntype.  There  were all kinds of ingenious suggestions\r\n\r\nabout  how one could build cheaper schools.  However,\r\n\r\nhe  said,  one  should not build those  cheap  houses\r\n\r\nbuilt  by the S.I.T., because one of these days there\r\n\r\nwill be better houses to live in. Then everybody will\r\n\r\nleave  the  S.I.T. houses and stay in beautiful  houses\r\n\r\nbuilt  by  private  enterprise where  there  will  be\r\n\r\ndining rooms plus a kitchen. Now, Sir, I do not  know\r\n\r\nhow  the  Member for Seletar reconciles  his  cheaper\r\n\r\nschools  with dearer houses. No doubt, it is  a  pity\r\n\r\nthat he has not up to now been given the opportunity - we  all  hope he will eventually be given before  the\r\n\r\nlife of this Assembly expires - of contributing to  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  processes of the Labour Front Government.\r\n\r\n[Interruption.]  Sir, I am glad  that  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister was duly excited at such a prospect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we in the People's Action Party\r\n\r\nfeel - perhaps  we  are the only Party  in  this  House\r\n\r\ntoday  which  does, and perhaps I more  than  anybody\r\n\r\nelse  in  this  House - terribly  disappointed  at  the\r\n\r\nfailure of a Socialist idea.

It is  no  different  in\r\n\r\nsubstance  from  any of the other Budgets  that  have\r\n\r\nbeen  presented before the Legislative Council  since\r\n\r\nthe  British re-occupation of Singapore. I  hold  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front directly responsible for  some  of  the\r\n\r\nshortcomings  of this Budget. For other shortcomings,\r\n\r\nI  hold  the  colonial officials who run  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront Government directly responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

The first is where\r\n\r\nI  hold  the Party Government to have been at  fault.\r\n\r\nThe second head is where I hold the Party Government - if  I  may  put  it inversely - not to be  directly  at\r\n\r\nfault, but nevertheless, indirectly responsible for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a Socialist Government shows\r\n\r\nitself  in  its  taxation  and  its  expenditure.   A\r\n\r\ndemocratic   Socialist   Party   seeks,   through   a\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy, to  introduce  taxation  in\r\n\r\norder  that money could be taken from those who  have\r\n\r\nand  to introduce social services in order that money\r\n\r\nor  benefits can be given to those who have not. Now,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Hon. the Minister for Communications  and\r\n\r\nWorks  (Mr  Thomas)  is a much  better  lecturer  on\r\n\r\nacademic Socialism than I am. No doubt, he will  come\r\n\r\nto the rescue of his apt disciple, the Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  when  he explains away  this  Budget.  The\r\n\r\npurpose of a Socialist movement is to create  a  more\r\n\r\negalitarian society and to bring about in a  peaceful\r\n\r\nand  orderly  way  a  redistribution  of  wealth  and\r\n\r\nopportunity.  Everyone  in Singapore,  including  the\r\n\r\nhon. Mr Sutherland, has accepted the verdict of  the\r\n\r\nelectorate  given  on 2nd April. No  one  doubts  the\r\n\r\nright  of the Labour Front Government to put up taxes\r\n\r\nin  order  that its plans and its promises  could  be\r\n\r\nimplemented.  Everyone in the \"have\"  group  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able to conceal his great relief that this  has\r\n\r\nnot, in fact, happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Financial Secretary in his speech made\r\n\r\nan  apologetic  admission  of  the  failings  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment which he is now serving. There  are  still\r\n\r\nechoes  in  his  speech of the  talk  to  extend  the\r\n\r\nbenefits of a welfare state. For instance, on page  5\r\n\r\nof his speech which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"These were subsequently pruned to $211 millions. In\r\n\r\nmaking  these reductions, the following objects  were\r\n\r\nkept  clearly  in  mind: the need to  limit  ordinary\r\n\r\ndepartmental  recurrent expenditure  to  the  minimum\r\n\r\nrequired  for  the efficient discharge of  Government\r\n\r\nbusiness: the need to make adequate provision for the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of the social services: and  the  need  to\r\n\r\naugment   the  funds  likely  to  be  available   for\r\n\r\ndevelopment   by  a  substantial  contribution   from\r\n\r\nrevenue...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>To   \"expand\"  the  benefits.  Then  there   was   an\r\n\r\napologetic  explanation why this  taxation  to  raise\r\n\r\nfunds  which were necessary to implement  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront Programme could not be brought about. A lot  of\r\n\r\npossible avenues were explored - income tax, companies\r\n\r\ntax, first registration of motor cars, etc. etc. They\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwent  up to the Federation and, of course, the  whole\r\n\r\nscheme fell through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also there were a lot of, in my\r\n\r\nview,  \"defensive\"  warnings of  large  increases  in\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  both  recurrent and  non-recurrent.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  so  much  so that the hon. Mr Sutherland  was\r\n\r\nmuch  alarmed at the future prospect and much excited\r\n\r\nthat such a stage should ever be allowed to pass. But\r\n\r\nhe comforted himself with the fact that all Financial\r\n\r\nSecretaries  in  colonial  governments   had   always\r\n\r\nthreatened the people with dire consequences, but the\r\n\r\ndire consequences never came to pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the criticisms of the speech of the Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary have this one tacit assumption - a\r\n\r\nchange  at  a  quiet  pace. The social  and  economic\r\n\r\nchanges  required in Singapore are to be carried  out\r\n\r\nat  a  pace which a peaceful and stable society would\r\n\r\nrequire.  That  is  an  assumption  with  which   the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party profoundly disagrees.  We  all\r\n\r\nknow  that  there is a political emergency in  Malaya\r\n\r\nwith an armed rebellion, lasting for eight years.  We\r\n\r\nhave  tried, in the short life of our Party, to bring\r\n\r\nhome  the  fact  that  this  political  rebellion  is\r\n\r\nlargely  caused  and  aided by  economic  and  social\r\n\r\ninjustices. Our approach to the problem of  governing\r\n\r\nSingapore,  our approach to the problems of  economic\r\n\r\nand social injustices, must therefore be an emergency\r\n\r\napproach, not a peacetime approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is useless to spend more money on the\r\n\r\nPolice - about $2 millions more - for the reorganisation\r\n\r\nof the Special Branch and other things. It is useless\r\n\r\nto  try and cure the political discontent if one does\r\n\r\nnot,  in  the  same  spirit of ruthlessness - ruthless,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  think  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  is\r\n\r\ncapable  of  being a ruthless administrator  for  the\r\n\r\ngood  of  the  country - pursue  remedies  swiftly  and\r\n\r\ndecisively  to  get rid of all the  awful  things  to\r\n\r\nwhich  the Hon. the Chief Minister himself,  when  he\r\n\r\nwas campaigning during the elections, referred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that within the framework of the existing\r\n\r\ntaxation  policy - I know the Hon. the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\ndoes not desire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  hear constructive criticism - a lot can be done  to\r\n\r\nmeet  this economic and social emergency. It  is  our\r\n\r\nview that taxation should be pushed up to the maximum\r\n\r\nthat  the  economy  of the country can  take  without\r\n\r\nupsetting  the  basic trades and the  basic  economic\r\n\r\nstructure of this country. It is our view, too,  that\r\n\r\nwe  should  be  prepared to mortgage our  future  and\r\n\r\nborrow up to the hilt if we are to save the future at\r\n\r\nall.  I do not know what was at the back of the  mind\r\n\r\nof  the  Hon. the Financial Secretary when,  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech  on  at  least  three separate  occasions,  he\r\n\r\nindicated that the Singapore loan market is  limited.\r\n\r\nIt says on page 7:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... not because our credit is in doubt\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>(in  spite of the Labour Front Government - that is  my\r\n\r\nown parenthesis, Mr Speaker, Sir)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"but  because  the  capacity of the  loan  market  is\r\n\r\nlimited.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>On page 11, he repeats:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Part of this sum can be met from liquid balances\r\n\r\nbut the great bulk of it will have to be borrowed  in\r\n\r\n1956. This may not be altogether easy. There will  be\r\n\r\nother borrowers on a not unlimited market.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Again, on page 14:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The local loan market is not unlimited in capacity.\r\n\r\nThere  will be other borrowers in the market  besides\r\n\r\nGovernment. Access to other markets may be  difficult\r\n\r\nto obtain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  whole  tenor of his speech is one of seeking  to\r\n\r\nforestall any criticism that, in fact, the Government\r\n\r\nhas no faith in itself; that, in fact, the Government\r\n\r\nis not prepared to do what is necessary, but is doing\r\n\r\nfrom  habit  exactly what it has always done.  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause of this attitude of mind that we get the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Communications and Works -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> You must do your homework!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

That\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous  item  of  $5 millions,  to  which  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin  (Mr Ede) referred  is  perhaps\r\n\r\ninclusive of this $123,000 for flood control.

There   was   a\r\n\r\nmagnificent opportunity to bring home to  the  people\r\n\r\nthat  democratic  Socialism can  deliver  the  goods.\r\n\r\nThere  was  an opportunity, if revenue could  not  be\r\n\r\nraised by direct taxation and immediate taxation,  to\r\n\r\nmortgage  the future, to do something which  must  be\r\n\r\ndone  by any government if it intends to govern  this\r\n\r\ncountry in a forceful and efficient manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the economic and social battle for\r\n\r\nMalaya  is likely to become more important  than  the\r\n\r\nmilitary and political battle. It is likely to become\r\n\r\nvery  much more important after these projected talks\r\n\r\nwith  representatives of the Malayan Communist Party.\r\n\r\nEvery  political Party understands - now at  any  rate,\r\n\r\nthey  did  not  before, not the Progressives  or  the\r\n\r\nDemocrats - that the people at large are not interested\r\n\r\nin   \"isms\":   Capitalism,  Socialism,  Fascism,   or\r\n\r\nCommunism.  They are only interested in  seeing  that\r\n\r\ntheir  ordinary lives improve. Whoever  can  work  to\r\n\r\nimprove their ordinary conditions of life gets  their\r\n\r\nloyalty  and allegiance. That is the basic  principle\r\n\r\nwhich  I  think the Labour Front Government at  heart\r\n\r\nreally  understands. It is for  that  reason  that  I\r\n\r\npropose  to examine the Labour Front's Programme  for\r\n\r\nhousing,  health, education and welfare within  their\r\n\r\nown   framework,   within  the  framework   of   this\r\n\r\nconstitution, and within the framework of the  Budget\r\n\r\nthat  has  always  been introduced  in  the  previous\r\n\r\nLegislative  Councils - housing, a house to  live  in;\r\n\r\nhealth,  education  for your children,  and  welfare,\r\n\r\nsecurity for the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front Programme on housing, which I think should be well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknown  to  those who were its authors,  was  a  bold,\r\n\r\nimaginative and an ambitious programme. Page 3 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Labour Front is convinced that no tangible\r\n\r\nprogress towards solving the Colony's housing problem\r\n\r\ncan  be  achieved  without a  Government  subsidy  on\r\n\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent of this subsidy will be carefully\r\n\r\ninvestigated  and, to the amount that  the  financial\r\n\r\nresources  of the Colony can bear it, it is  proposed\r\n\r\nthe subsidy should take the following form: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A direct contribution from Government to\r\n\r\nfinance  the  housing  programme  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust at a much more accelerated  speed\r\n\r\nthan at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will entail converting the S.I.T. into a\r\n\r\nstatutory  Government  housing  agency,  instead  of\r\n\r\nbeing   a  quasi-Government  body  with  restrictive\r\n\r\npowers as at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A reduction of the present interest rates on\r\n\r\nGovernment loans to the S.I.T., thereby providing  for\r\n\r\ncheaper rentals for Trust accommodation and carrying\r\n\r\nthis important social amenity to a larger number  of\r\n\r\nthe lower income group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The encouragement of Housing within a Co-operative movement which assists the common man\r\n\r\nthrough  thrift and enterprise to possess a home  of\r\n\r\nhis  own. It is proposed to assist this movement  by\r\n\r\nlending  a  large portion of the capital needed  for\r\n\r\nhousing projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The Labour Front considers housing as\r\n\r\nimportant as water, roads and electricity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  Sir,  the  Hon. the Financial  Secretary,  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  the  Labour Front, has  this  to  say  on\r\n\r\nhousing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As I stated earlier, there are other commitments of\r\n\r\na  capital  nature in addition to those appearing  in\r\n\r\nthe development estimates.

It is  hoped  that  the\r\n\r\nTrust  will be able to build new Units to a value  of\r\n\r\nat  least  $18 millions in 1956, although  much  will\r\n\r\ndepend on whether some solution can be found for  the\r\n\r\nproblem of clearing suitable sites.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>$18 millions, Sir, for the S.I.T. for 1956. He doubts\r\n\r\nwhether  the S.I.T. could, in fact, use up  that  $18\r\n\r\nmillions.  The Progressive Party has been doing  that\r\n\r\nin conjunction with their colonial administrators for\r\n\r\nmany  years.  The S.I.T. has, in fact, at  one  stage\r\n\r\ngiven  up  the hope of ever catching up with  housing\r\n\r\nbecause it said the birth rate was increasing at such\r\n\r\na  terrific  pace.

These  are  spread\r\n\r\nthroughout the many departments and divisions of  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  and  reference  must  be  made   to   the\r\n\r\nEstimates to find out where and what they are. In all\r\n\r\npersonal  emoluments total $18.5 millions as compared\r\n\r\nwith  $16.8  millions in 1955. Recurrent  expenditure\r\n\r\ntotals  $8.1 millions compared with $8.2 millions  in\r\n\r\n1955. The contribution to the Hospitals Board and Tan\r\n\r\nTock  Seng  are reduced below 1955 levels.

In all, Medical and Health Expenditure  totals\r\n\r\n$28.8 millions compared with $27.4 millions in 1955.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all that the Labour Front has done\r\n\r\nin this field of Medical and Health is to increase by\r\n\r\n$1.36 millions, the amount voted for it in 1955\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  Progressive Party-cum-colonial Government - $1.36  millions - and  of  that the  Hon. the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary was kind enough to inform us, a great  deal\r\n\r\nwas  going  to  be  taken up by annual  increases  in\r\n\r\nemoluments for serving officers. Where is the capital\r\n\r\ndevelopment? One district hospital worth $3 millions,\r\n\r\nof  which an almost token vote of $100,000 is  sought\r\n\r\nfor 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education - Labour Front Programme, page 5 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"FREE SCHOOLING FOR ALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front's Policy on education is free\r\n\r\ncompulsory schooling for all children, in English or\r\n\r\nvernacular schools, for the first six years as a\r\n\r\nmatter of first priority.

This gives a clear idea of the rate of\r\n\r\nexpansion of the Department.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Finally he winds up saying that the increase, which\r\n\r\nis $12.9 millions over last year's Estimates, is\r\n\r\nlargely to meet the natural increase in the cost of\r\n\r\nteachers, and the $10 millions extra cost to give\r\n\r\nequivalent treatment to Chinese schools by grants-in-aid. No attempt is made to achieve this commendable\r\n\r\nideal of free compulsory schooling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon has cited his personal\r\n\r\nexperience of people knocking at his door asking  him\r\n\r\nto  use his influence as a school-master to get their\r\n\r\nchildren  places in school. I am afraid, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  he  will find it extremely  difficult  to\r\n\r\nfulfil  all his personal obligations unless  he  gets\r\n\r\nthe  consent  of the Hon. the Minister for  Education\r\n\r\n(Mr Chew Swee Kee) to spend some millions of dollars\r\n\r\nimmediately,  and not in the future,  to  bring  this\r\n\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, nothing has been said of welfare, so I\r\n\r\ncannot blame the Labour Front for not doing anything.\r\n\r\nThey did not say a word about welfare but the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Financial Secretary said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Social Welfare: Provision for Public Assistance has\r\n\r\nbeen increased from $4 millions to $5 millions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one looks at the Estimates on page 17, there is\r\n\r\nan  increase  shown of $1.07 millions over  what  was\r\n\r\nvoted  last  year. Mr Speaker, Sir, an  increase  of\r\n\r\n$1.07  millions  to  look after the  welfare  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, sickness benefits, unemployment benefits  and\r\n\r\nT.B. benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one looks at the Head: Police, one finds that it\r\n\r\nhas  gone  up  even more than Social  Welfare,  $2.65\r\n\r\nmillions over what was spent last year - $2.65 millions\r\n\r\nout  of  a  total of $50 odd millions. We  are  told,\r\n\r\namongst other things, that the Special Branch of  the\r\n\r\nC.I.D. is  to be reorganised. Sir, if  one  were  to\r\n\r\nspend  more money, not just a little bit, but  a  lot\r\n\r\nmore money on housing, health, education and welfare,\r\n\r\nit  is my belief - I may be quite wrong because it may\r\n\r\nbe a bit too late in the day - but it is my belief, the\r\n\r\nonly  faith  that one can have in such  a  situation,\r\n\r\nthat  it would not be necessary to have more and more\r\n\r\nincreases of expenditure on para-military forces.  It\r\n\r\nis  better to prevent a situation which gives rise to\r\n\r\nthis  need  for  more policemen rather  than  try  to\r\n\r\ncontain   the   situation  from  getting   worse   by\r\n\r\nrepressive Police measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, asks the Labour Front Government, are we to get\r\n\r\nthe  taxes? The Hon. the Chief Minister has said that\r\n\r\ntobacco is a poor man's luxury and one of these days,\r\n\r\nwhen  cheap tobacco is manufactured locally, he  will\r\n\r\ntax  imported  tobacco. He will tax imports,  but  he\r\n\r\nwill  allow  cheap local tobacco to be  sold  without\r\n\r\ntax.  Now,  Sir, I seldom agree with the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin and I hope I shall not have much occasion to - unless,  of course, he gets converted into  something\r\n\r\nor  the other. But I must agree with him that tobacco\r\n\r\nshould not have been allowed to escape unscathed.  It\r\n\r\nis not a necessity and, in fact, there has been a lot\r\n\r\nof  medical literature to say that people should  not\r\n\r\nsmoke  cigarettes.  Of course,  the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  is one who enjoys the fragrance of Virginia\r\n\r\nin  a  leather-bound  pipe and, like  the  generous-hearted man he is, he likes everybody in Singapore to\r\n\r\nenjoy   his   vices   and  share  the   benefits   of\r\n\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

They have made it so that today it is\r\n\r\ncheaper for a rich man to die in the Federation  than\r\n\r\nto die in Singapore. The Hon. the Financial Secretary\r\n\r\nhas  said that there would be a flight of all wealth,\r\n\r\ncompanies,  and  capital in the Federation  if  there\r\n\r\nwere discrepancies in fiscal rates, either income tax\r\n\r\nor  companies tax or any other form of taxation which\r\n\r\nis  direct.

They\r\n\r\nare in a more acute economic position than Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey wanted two years ago, in my recollection, to put\r\n\r\nup  the companies tax and the income tax. It was then\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanglin's friends and relatives in the\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party  Government  who  most  vehemently\r\n\r\nprevented  it. They gave some millions of dollars  of\r\n\r\nSingapore money, which had already come out of  their\r\n\r\npockets,  to  the  Federation to  prevent  them  from\r\n\r\ntaking more money out of their pockets in the future.\r\n\r\nThere  should  have  been more courage  and  boldness\r\n\r\nshown,  more  imagination. The long-term  trends  are\r\n\r\nclear. The Federation taxes cannot be below Singapore\r\n\r\ntaxes. They cannot afford it, and if we had increased\r\n\r\neither the companies tax or the income tax, it  would\r\n\r\nnot  have  been  worth any company's  while,  or  any\r\n\r\nshareholder's  while, to transfer his assets  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  because he will be caught with  the  same\r\n\r\ntaxes in the Federation in a very short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I will come - I know the Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister is somewhat alarmed, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nhe has shot his arrow for the first time -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

This is the\r\n\r\nfirst time, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Government  of\r\n\r\nthe  Colony of Singapore has had to present a  Budget\r\n\r\nto be discussed publicly. Before that, they did it in\r\n\r\nthe discreet cloisters of Empress Place.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Do not waste time!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

There are  innumerable  items\r\n\r\nwhich no one, unless he is a Member of the Government\r\n\r\nand has access to Government files, can know about. I\r\n\r\nshall  refer  to  a  few of them briefly  by  way  of\r\n\r\nexample.  There  has  been  a  change  in  form   and\r\n\r\nclassification.  My  contention  is  that  the  whole\r\n\r\npresentation   in   this  form  is   inadequate   and\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory   because   it   gives    insufficient\r\n\r\ninformation.  What information it does give  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult   to  comprehend.  Take  an  example,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   first  of   all,   at   page   108,\r\n\r\n\"$40,000 - Commissions,  Conferences  and   Visits   of\r\n\r\nAdvisers\".   What   is  it  all   about?   Who   gets\r\n\r\ncommissions, conferences and visits of advisers?  The\r\n\r\nTreasury?   \"Title  changed  from   Commissions   and\r\n\r\nConferences.       Previously       shown       under\r\n\r\nHead - Miscellaneous Services.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, at page 53 - \"Passages and Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nTravelling Expenses - $ 1,600,000.\" What does it mean?\r\n\r\nI  can  quite  believe, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that  our\r\n\r\nexpatriate civil service do require a very large  sum\r\n\r\nof  money  to  flit back and forth on  their  regular\r\n\r\nrecuperative journeys, back to their homeland. But  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  understand  what \"Miscellaneous  Travelling\r\n\r\nExpenses\"  mean. Does it include, for  instance,  Mr\r\n\r\nCresson's flight to Britain and back? Who has control\r\n\r\nover   this?   Last   year,  the   Estimates   showed\r\n\r\n$1,000,000.  This year we are asked to  vote  another\r\n\r\n$600,000. We do not know what this is all about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on page 78, we have this curious item - nobody\r\n\r\ncan make sense out of it. I have asked quite a number\r\n\r\nof  those who ought to know what it is all about  and\r\n\r\nthey  say  they do not know. Under the Head:  Police,\r\n\r\nitem  14,  \"Expenses connected with Medical Treatment\r\n\r\nin  United Kingdom.\" What is it all about?  Are  they\r\n\r\npeople  who  have  been shot and must  recuperate  in\r\n\r\nBritain? Is it because our medical facilities at  the\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospital are inadequate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

Is\r\n\r\nthis  democracy,  Sir? I know of  certain people  who\r\n\r\nwould  be delighted to read of this because  it  will\r\n\r\nonly renew their faith in that this constitutionalism\r\n\r\nis  a lot of eye-wash. This is, in fact, colonialism,\r\n\r\nlegal  lawful  looting. The Hon. the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nsays  he believes that his civil service have carried\r\n\r\nout   economies.  He  issued  a  directive  and  they\r\n\r\nfaithfully  carried  it  out.  Does  he   know,   for\r\n\r\ninstance,  how these economies were effected  in  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Department? Medical Department economies - not\r\n\r\nin   emoluments.  That  did  not  go  down.  Nor   in\r\n\r\nappointments, because they are going to appoint  many\r\n\r\nnew  superscales, a fact which has set the  whole  of\r\n\r\nthe  senior  local  medical service  up  in  arms - all\r\n\r\nsuperscale  posts  for  expatriates.

The\r\n\r\nappropriation for the grant-in-aid to Chinese schools\r\n\r\nhas  increased from $4,370,000 to about $10 millions,\r\n\r\nbut  out  of the total appropriation of $46  millions\r\n\r\nfor  the  education service for 1956, Chinese schools\r\n\r\nonly  receive slightly over 20 per cent. I fear  this\r\n\r\ncould  not  be  construed as  a  fair  and  equitable\r\n\r\ndistribution of funds, as Chinese schools cater to as\r\n\r\nmany  students  as  the  English  schools.  From  the\r\n\r\nEstimates,  we understand that many new schools  will\r\n\r\nbe  built  in  1956, but we would like Government  to\r\n\r\nclarify  in  more detail what types of schools  these\r\n\r\nnew ones will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sincerely hope that the Government will declare\r\n\r\nits  stand  on  vernacular  education  in  clear  and\r\n\r\nunequivocal  terms, for a fair and  equitable  policy\r\n\r\ntowards  all  races in their school development,  and\r\n\r\nthat  sufficient funds be allotted both in  grant-in-aid  as well as in capital expenditure.

If they accept the colonial system, then\r\n\r\ntheir  programmes are always the same. They  may  use\r\n\r\ndifferent words to explain the same things. They  may\r\n\r\nthink  that  they  can fool the  people  with  pretty\r\n\r\nwords, but action will show they are humbugs and that\r\n\r\nis what this Budget shows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colonial policy has been to encourage English\r\n\r\neducation  and  cut the people of this  country  from\r\n\r\ntheir  cultures and traditions, so that they will  be\r\n\r\nreally  stooges of the colonial masters, and so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will be cut away from the masses of the  people\r\n\r\nand have no choice but to throw in their lot with the\r\n\r\nforeigners  they have been taught to ape.

It is an English language school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told to expect great things from the All-Party Report on Education. We can see in the Budget\r\n\r\nproposals  here  what the Labour Front  thinks  about\r\n\r\nnational  education, or at least what their back-seat\r\n\r\ndrivers think. This shows us that we must not  expect\r\n\r\nanything from the Report.

It is not, of course,\r\n\r\nthe  case,  but  I certainly think a very  good  case\r\n\r\ncould  be made out to provide some colonial officials\r\n\r\nto  do the thinking for the Opposition, because their\r\n\r\nthinking  is  really very poor quality  indeed.

He\r\n\r\nobjected  very  strongly, Mr  Speaker,  to  \"certain\r\n\r\npeople who pay no heed to the existing situation  and\r\n\r\nformulate their plans blindly\"; and I feel that these\r\n\r\nwords  \"pay  no  heed to the existing  situation  and\r\n\r\nformulate   their  plans  blindly\"  might   well   be\r\n\r\nembroidered  on a banner and hung over the  heads  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition, because I have seldom heard so  many\r\n\r\nspeeches  which took no account of the situation  and\r\n\r\nwhich,  as  far  as  they  formulate  at  all,   were\r\n\r\nformulated with a more than myopic blindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one or two points of detail with which I\r\n\r\nwould  like to deal but I think, first, I might clear\r\n\r\nup  a misapprehension in the minds of the Opposition.\r\n\r\nIt  has appeared again and again.

Socialism  is not a welfare state.  A  welfare\r\n\r\nstate  is  not Socialism. A welfare state  may  be  a\r\n\r\ntransition  stage where a Socialist arrives  at  some\r\n\r\npoint. In Russia, the welfare state is still \"pie  in\r\n\r\nthe sky\". The Russian Socialist Government imposes  a\r\n\r\nvery  low  standard  of living in  the  interests  of\r\n\r\naccumulating   more  capital.  Communist   China   is\r\n\r\nfollowing  on  the same lines. In Great Britain,  the\r\n\r\nDemocratic   Socialists - the  Labour   Party - put   the\r\n\r\nwelfare state first and progress towards other  parts\r\n\r\nof  Socialism  later. It is a complete mistake - and  I\r\n\r\nsay  it  with  regret because I thought we  had  some\r\n\r\npeople  in  the  Opposition who knew  what  Socialism\r\n\r\nwas - to  believe that the welfare state is  the  first\r\n\r\nobjective  of Socialism. It is not. I cannot  give  a\r\n\r\nfull  lecture  on  Socialism but in this  context  of\r\n\r\nBudget  work  the  essential facet of  Socialism,  on\r\n\r\nwhich  I  will  ask the so-called Socialists  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition to fix their minds, is that we must  apply\r\n\r\nthe  techniques  of  technology  and  planning  on  a\r\n\r\nnational  scale.  That is the basic  facet  on  which\r\n\r\nother aspects of Socialism are going to depend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amiable suggestion by the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  that all the money in the world that we  could\r\n\r\npossibly  raise  be instantly seized  and  spent - \"$60\r\n\r\nmillions on flood control! Have it straightaway! Good\r\n\r\nheavens,  give it to the City area alone! Never  mind\r\n\r\nthe  rest of the island! Let us put $60 millions into\r\n\r\nthe  City  area!

Next Wednesday the plan  will  go  into\r\n\r\naction  to deal with the small-scale flooding in  the\r\n\r\nBedok-Ketapang area, and that is the first stage.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  relatively  small  thing.  It  does  not  cost\r\n\r\n$123,000  as he thought. It costs $523,000, $400,000\r\n\r\nmore.  He  has not studied the Estimates  with  quite\r\n\r\nenough  care perhaps to see what the total  cost  is,\r\n\r\nbut that is the total cost as shown in the Estimates.\r\n\r\nIf  he  or the Member for Tanglin, who talks on  such\r\n\r\nsimilar  lines, would like to come along  at  8  a.m.\r\n\r\nnext  Wednesday,  the 23rd, to the 8th  mile,  Changi\r\n\r\nRoad,  I will arrange that they can come with me  and\r\n\r\nsee  the  start  of  a nice little  flood  prevention\r\n\r\nscheme  for that little area.

I  am   also\r\n\r\narranging  for the Chief Drainage Engineer  to  visit\r\n\r\nLorong  Tai Seng shortly and to give a little lecture\r\n\r\nto the farmers on what they can do in the way of self-help.  They  have  made  some  attempt  at  self-help\r\n\r\nalready,  but unfortunately they did not  quite  know\r\n\r\nwhat  to do. They did it rather the wrong way, but  I\r\n\r\nhope  shortly  to be able to arrange,  now  that  the\r\n\r\nlevels have been taken, that they can be apprised  of\r\n\r\nwhat they have to do to help themselves. I shall  try\r\n\r\nto be present for that lecture and if any hon. Member\r\n\r\nwould like to come,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  am  sure  the people of Lorong Tai Seng  would  be\r\n\r\ndelighted to see him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem about this flood prevention is one\r\n\r\nwhich   I   have  explained  before,  but  it   seems\r\n\r\nimpossible for the Opposition to grasp it. It is that\r\n\r\nyou  have got to get the water off the island. It  is\r\n\r\nno  use  merely shifting the water from one place  to\r\n\r\nanother  on the island and drying one place in  order\r\n\r\nto  drown  another. You have got to get  it  off  the\r\n\r\nisland.  Now,  the development of Singapore  is  such\r\n\r\nthat you find roads running across all the points  at\r\n\r\nwhich  the water has to get away. You will also  find\r\n\r\nin  housing  estates all kinds of complications.  You\r\n\r\ncannot  just dig a whacking great drain out  to  sea: you  cannot  get the water away without very  costly,\r\n\r\nand  very lengthy works. In due course, Flood Control\r\n\r\nreports will be available and they will be tabled  in\r\n\r\nthis  House. Members can then discuss them. They  can\r\n\r\nlook  into  the cost involved and if the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar feels so strongly that $60 millions for\r\n\r\nflood prevention is chicken feed or peanuts, well, by\r\n\r\nall  means let him get up and urge that we spend  the\r\n\r\nmoney and justify it against all the other costs that\r\n\r\nwill  have  to be met as well. If he is so  confident\r\n\r\nthe  money is there, perhaps he will show us  how  to\r\n\r\nget it and advise - oh, very cleverly - advise us how  to\r\n\r\ndispose of our available money without depriving  any\r\n\r\nother essential Government service of the money which\r\n\r\nit needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Tanglin raised a point about the\r\n\r\nextravagance in Government building. He was very much\r\n\r\ndisturbed  because  he said that the  Government  had\r\n\r\ndone nothing, since it came into office, to deal with\r\n\r\nthis  problem  of  extravagance in building  and  the\r\n\r\nwasteful  use  of materials. He made quite  a  heart-rending  little  speech about it.  Unfortunately,  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  know what he is talking about. If  he  had\r\n\r\nasked  me  beforehand, \"Have you done  anything?\",  I\r\n\r\nwould have given him all the details, but he has  not\r\n\r\nasked  me  and so he has exposed himself to  a  reply\r\n\r\nwhich I hope will give him great satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very soon after we came into office that we\r\n\r\nfirst  started  discussing  the  cost  of  Government\r\n\r\nbuildings, because it was obvious that we  would  not\r\n\r\nhave  enough  available funds to deal  with  all  the\r\n\r\nthings  that had to be done, and it was obvious  that\r\n\r\nwe could cut something off the cost of building. Some\r\n\r\nmonths  ago  a  file was opened in my  Ministry.  The\r\n\r\nmatter  has been discussed and dealt with and we  now\r\n\r\nhave taken what, in effect, is a complete overhaul of\r\n\r\nthe  machinery by which plans for buildings are dealt\r\n\r\nwith.  We  have  the Public Works Standing  Committee\r\n\r\nwhich has been given additional powers to ensure that\r\n\r\nplanning  is  not wasteful, and to ensure  that  when\r\n\r\nheads  of departments put up a scheme, they will  not\r\n\r\nput  up an extravagant or unnecessary scheme. We also\r\n\r\nhave  a special Working Party on the cost of building\r\n\r\nschools. We  also have a special working party on the cost  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  medical units - hospitals and other  medical\r\n\r\nbuildings -  and  finally we are  in  the  process  of\r\n\r\nsetting  up  a high level Advisory Panel representing\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  the  City  Council,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust and private experts who will advise\r\n\r\nthe   Government;  firstly,  on  means  of   reducing\r\n\r\nbuilding  costs  in general; and,  secondly,  on  any\r\n\r\nproject  which  is  scheduled to cost  more  than  $1\r\n\r\nmillion.  So  when the Member for Tanglin  says  that\r\n\r\nnothing  has been done, I can only tell  him  that  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal has been done and I hope, in due  course,\r\n\r\nhe will see the fruits -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> When?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

You see, here again, you have this thing of  not\r\n\r\nheeding    existing   conditions   and    formulating\r\n\r\ncriticisms  blindly. If you will  think  of  it,  any\r\n\r\nproject necessarily involves a year or even two years\r\n\r\nin  the  planning  stage before the  actual  building\r\n\r\nstarts  to  go up. If our Working Party  said,  \"This\r\n\r\nschool  has just got the foundations laid out but  we\r\n\r\nare  now  going to cut it out.

You would\r\n\r\nbe  frightfully  wasteful and  uneconomic.  The  only\r\n\r\nthing to do is to put your Committee to work on  your\r\n\r\nfuture planning, meanwhile carrying out your existing\r\n\r\nplans,  except that when they are at an  early  stage\r\n\r\nthey  can be changed. Therefore, it is impossible,  I\r\n\r\nam  afraid,  to promise you that when a Committee  is\r\n\r\nset  up  today,  there  will be no  more  extravagant\r\n\r\nbuilding  tomorrow, because although you  could  stop\r\n\r\nthe  extravagant  building  you  would  also  put   a\r\n\r\ncomplete  stop to the whole building programme,  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, it is necessary to take time. I know  that\r\n\r\ntime is a thing which the Opposition is reluctant  to\r\n\r\nallow  us, but I am afraid they will have to  put  up\r\n\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point about the so-called\r\n\r\nextravagance  of  Government  buildings.   You   must\r\n\r\nremember  that  the Government builds in  the  public\r\n\r\ninterests  and has to maintain buildings from  public\r\n\r\nfunds,  and  if  the buildings fall  down  or  become\r\n\r\nunusable,  they will have to be replaced from  public\r\n\r\nfunds.  But the private builder does not do that.  He\r\n\r\nbuilds  largely  for sale, and the maintenance  costs\r\n\r\nand  so on then fall on the purchaser who, if  he  is\r\n\r\nfoolish  enough to buy a house that falls  down,  has\r\n\r\napparently  very  little  remedy  in  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should not go below a certain  reasonable\r\n\r\nstandard of permanence and soundness of construction,\r\n\r\nor  else  we  will  be  faced year  after  year  with\r\n\r\nadditional and unnecessary costs for maintenance  and\r\n\r\nrepair, and finally we will be faced with high  costs\r\n\r\nof replacement at an early date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That deals with the major points raised by the\r\n\r\nOpposition  on  the things that concern  my  Ministry\r\n\r\nmost,  but I think I might deal briefly perhaps  with\r\n\r\nanother  thing. There seems to be some  confusion  in\r\n\r\ntheir minds in that a lot of references were made  to\r\n\r\nthe  social services, and it is with reluctance  that\r\n\r\nI,   once   again,  feel  myself  impelled  to   give\r\n\r\ninstruction  to  the Opposition. I  wish  they  would\r\n\r\ninstruct themselves and then we shall all save  time.\r\n\r\nIt would be, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy   mind,   unwise  to  lash  out  into  extravagant\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on social services until  you  have  got\r\n\r\nwhat stands first in our Labour Front Programme,  and\r\n\r\nthat is a survey of the national wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Great Britain, you have got a reasonably adequate\r\n\r\nsurvey  machinery. The economists complained that  it\r\n\r\nwas  not  adequate but they managed to  produce  some\r\n\r\nfigures all the same, and they were able to say  that\r\n\r\nthe  total  capital expenditure on  fixed  assets  in\r\n\r\nGreat  Britain  was so many hundred millions  in  one\r\n\r\nyear,  and so many thousand millions in another year.\r\n\r\nAs  you  could  break  that  down  into  the  various\r\n\r\nheadings  under which it was spent, you can then  see\r\n\r\nhow  much  you are actually spending on fixed  assets\r\n\r\nfor  social  services. In Great Britain,  the  social\r\n\r\nservices, as a whole, come to around 30 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  total  capital expenditure on all fixed  assets,\r\n\r\nand  of  that 30 per cent, about 23 per cent goes  on\r\n\r\nhousing. I have not got the detailed figures. I  have\r\n\r\nthem  available in my bag but I will not  waste  your\r\n\r\ntime with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing is a very, very essential social service. It\r\n\r\nis  almost  basic  in  the social  service  programme\r\n\r\nbecause,  unless you get your housing done,  you  are\r\n\r\ngoing to have a slum population and a slum population\r\n\r\nis  a  political  and economic liability.  Some  slum\r\n\r\ndwellers   in   Singapore - a  remarkable   number   of\r\n\r\nthem - manage  to  rise  above  their  environment  and\r\n\r\nmaintain   proper   standards   of   behaviour    and\r\n\r\ncleanliness, character formation and so  on,  but  by\r\n\r\nand  large, the pressure of life in the slum is  such\r\n\r\nthat,  scientifically speaking,  it  does  cause  the\r\n\r\npopulation to deteriorate as human material. You  get\r\n\r\nan  irresponsible,  unemployable,  uneducable,  dull,\r\n\r\nbackward,   and  criminal  population  which   is   a\r\n\r\npermanent  liability to that part of  the  population\r\n\r\nwhich  is  employable and productive and it  is  most\r\n\r\nimportant that you should get rid of your slums as  a\r\n\r\nmatter of first priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education and health services are, of course, social\r\n\r\nservices.  I do not think we need deal with  them  at\r\n\r\nvery great length, but what you should not forget\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  the basic social services without which all  the\r\n\r\nothers  could not exist. Those basic social  services\r\n\r\nare  water,  light,  roads, fire services,  drainage,\r\n\r\nsewerage,   telephones,  postal  services,   prisons,\r\n\r\nharbours,  airports,  barracks and  accommodation  of\r\n\r\nthat  kind,  and all the offices and equipment  which\r\n\r\nthe  public service needs. These are often overlooked\r\n\r\nbut they are, in fact, basic social services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the last \"blind formulation\" of the Opposition\r\n\r\nwhich  I would like to deal with came, if I recollect\r\n\r\nrightly, from the Member for Tanjong Pagar, I  think.\r\n\r\nHe  addressed  us with all the bounce and  the  jolly\r\n\r\ncheekiness of a sixth form schoolboy in his  debating\r\n\r\nsociety.  He  made his usual little  joke  about  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanglin Club (Mr Sutherland). He has made\r\n\r\nit  about ten times now. It still amuses him although\r\n\r\nit has become rather stale to the rest of us. He made\r\n\r\nhis usual little jeers and some jibes and he promised\r\n\r\nus  a lot of constructive criticism. But when it came\r\n\r\nto  the  point, nothing constructive emerged  at  all\r\n\r\nexcept  what  he  had  copied  from  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin.   There  is  a  very  remarkable  similarity\r\n\r\nbetween their two speeches -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Dear me, dear me!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> And you may well say, \"Dear me\", because\r\n\r\nit  was  really quite pathetic. I thought, hopefully,\r\n\r\nthat  soon after the little jokes, he would get  down\r\n\r\nto  something constructive. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\ngot nothing constructive except a wild statement that\r\n\r\nyou  could impose taxation; you could do a  lot;  you\r\n\r\ncould tax up to the maximum; you could mortgage  your\r\n\r\nfuture;  borrow up to the hilt - I do not know how  you\r\n\r\npropose to pay - ten per cent or twenty per cent on the\r\n\r\nmoney  you are borrowing? What rate are you going  to\r\n\r\npay?  Well, do not mind about that! Borrow the money!\r\n\r\nIt  does  not matter what it costs! Let  us  get  the\r\n\r\nmoney  in!  Spend it at once! Never  mind  about  the\r\n\r\nfuture because the present is so terrible! We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot get on! Well, it is a point of view, but it is\r\n\r\nnot  a  very fruitful one. What he was aiming  at,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  was a Socialist redistribution of  income  in\r\n\r\nwhich  we  were  going to arrive  at  an  egalitarian\r\n\r\nsociety.  I  think I am representing  him  correctly.\r\n\r\nWell,  he is not certainly going to redistribute  our\r\n\r\nincome  very  rapidly by those techniques  of  fiscal\r\n\r\npolicy. The effect of his redistribution would be  to\r\n\r\ndistribute  our income to all the other countries  of\r\n\r\nthe  world  and  to  leave us in a  state  of  abject\r\n\r\npoverty.  I do not think that that was his intention,\r\n\r\nbut that would probably be the result of the sort  of\r\n\r\nfiscal policy which he envisaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the egalitarian side of it, we might all be\r\n\r\nleft  in an equal state of misery and poverty, but  I\r\n\r\ndo  not think that is what he wanted us to be  in.  I\r\n\r\nthink  he  would  prefer us all to be prosperous  and\r\n\r\nwell.  In any case, the egalitarian idea is one which\r\n\r\nis accepted by practically no Socialists in the world\r\n\r\ntoday, except a few armchair Socialists. It has  been\r\n\r\nabandoned  in Russia most emphatically. It  is  being\r\n\r\nrapidly  abandoned  in  China.  It  has  never   been\r\n\r\naccepted  in Great Britain. It was never accepted  in\r\n\r\nAustralia under its Labour Government. In fact, I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  you can point to any place in  the  world\r\n\r\nwhere  the  egalitarian idea remains in the Socialist\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Whether  it  is possible  is  one  thing.\r\n\r\nWhether  it  is  desirable  is  another.  But  as  an\r\n\r\nimmediate objective for a Socialist Government, I  do\r\n\r\nnot think it has got any value at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  sat  here  in  the morning  and  heard  with\r\n\r\nconsiderable surprise some of the speeches.

They are out-labouring the Labour Front, just like the\r\n\r\nProgressives  did  during  the  Assistant   Ministers\r\n\r\ncrisis. Probably the Government is happy at the  turn\r\n\r\nof  events.  Now  there are no major difficulties  to\r\n\r\nextend the Coalition. There will be no need for soul-searching  and  justification. The  Progressives  and\r\n\r\nDemocrats can join up with the Labour Front.  It  may\r\n\r\nbe  that these Parties will have watered down some of\r\n\r\ntheir  Socialism  to accommodate  the  Labour  Front.\r\n\r\nAfter  all,  the Progressives planned to build  seven\r\n\r\ndistrict  hospitals, or was it only six?  The  Labour\r\n\r\nFront has only one to offer us - that a paper one,  not\r\n\r\na house made of bricks but a paper one. It reminds me\r\n\r\nof a paper motor car they burn at Chinese funerals. I\r\n\r\nhope  this  hospital is not made for burning  at  the\r\n\r\npolitical  funeral  of  the  Labour  Front.  If   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  goes on at the rate they have been  going\r\n\r\ntill now, the funeral will not be far away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government seems to have forgotten that a large\r\n\r\nnumber of people live in the rural districts and with\r\n\r\nall sorts of services. All of it cannot be done in  a\r\n\r\nyear, but we expect to see a start. It is the absence\r\n\r\nof  this that has disappointed most of us. They  need\r\n\r\npipe  water,  electricity and medical  services.  The\r\n\r\nBudget  does  not  show that the Government  is  even\r\n\r\nthinking  in these terms. The Government thinks  that\r\n\r\nit  has to deal with a standstill Budget. They  spend\r\n\r\nthe  same amount of money as they did last year.  But\r\n\r\nthey  seem to forget that the population in the rural\r\n\r\nareas  is  not at all at a standstill. It is  growing\r\n\r\nand  therefore per capita expenditure is reduced. The\r\n\r\nservices  available to the people in the rural  areas\r\n\r\nwill  be  reduced. Therefore, it is a retreat  Budget\r\n\r\nand not a standstill one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a month ago, the Hon. the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works (Mr Thomas)  informed  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that nearly $60 millions is needed  for  flood\r\n\r\ncontrol.

He  says  that\r\n\r\nbuilding of all these works takes time. We agree that\r\n\r\nit  takes  time but we also must think of  the  money\r\n\r\nthat is going to be spent next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget, we have now a sum of approximately\r\n\r\n$30 millions provided for expenditure under the Head:\r\n\r\nPublic  Works  Non-Recurrent.  Now,  why  do  we  not\r\n\r\npropose  to ask for this amount to be cut  down?  The\r\n\r\nanswer is because we also realise that today we  have\r\n\r\nto  look  after  the under-privileged, and  everybody\r\n\r\nwill  have to face up to taxation. Still, we want  to\r\n\r\nsee  that,  for  the expenditure of  this  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney,   we   must   have   at   least   double   the\r\n\r\nac-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommodation.  During the last few  years,  we  have\r\n\r\nheard  the Public Works Department lower the cost  of\r\n\r\nquarters  for  the rank and file of the  Police  from\r\n\r\n$10,000  to  $5,000  each.  This  is  a  very   great\r\n\r\nachievement and, to my mind, there is no  reason  why\r\n\r\nsuch standards cannot be applied to the quarters  now\r\n\r\ndesigned or provided in the Estimates for Division  I\r\n\r\nOfficers,  or  for  Police Superintendents  for  whom\r\n\r\nprovision of $45,000 per quarter has been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now unless we do so and do it straightaway, we are\r\n\r\ngoing  to throw away millions and millions of dollars\r\n\r\nwhich  we  can  ill  afford today. Strangely  enough,\r\n\r\nduring the last two occasions, I have found myself in\r\n\r\nagreement with the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew) when he said that a change in the name  of\r\n\r\nthe department must involve a change of heart. I must\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister and his officers to  look  at  the\r\n\r\nwhole   programme  of  development  in  an   entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent light. Do not think that because you put up\r\n\r\nsubstantial  buildings, like Fullerton  Building,  on\r\n\r\nwhich a tremendous amount of money has been spent, or\r\n\r\nsubstantial buildings like the General Hospital,  you\r\n\r\nare going to save maintenance expenditure, because in\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates  there is $1,200,000 to  be  spent  on\r\n\r\nrenovation  and alteration to Fullerton Building  and\r\n\r\n$2  millions  for the General Hospital.  Now,  is  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to spend all this money on renovation  and\r\n\r\nalteration? What saving is there to have  built  such\r\n\r\nhuge  buildings  to  last  a  thousand  years?  None,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  now to spend $3,200,000  which  is\r\n\r\nexactly  the  amount which will be required  for  the\r\n\r\nvery,  very  urgent district hospital at Kallang  for\r\n\r\nwhich   only  $100,000  has  been  provided  in   the\r\n\r\nEstimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take up this question of the district\r\n\r\nhospital at Kallang. About two years ago, after a lot\r\n\r\nof  complaints that people had to travel a  long  way\r\n\r\nthrough  a  crowded  town to  get  treatment  at  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital, especially for those who  live  in\r\n\r\nthe Katong and Serangoon areas, the Progressive Party\r\n\r\nsuggested  that, as soon as the Terminal Building  of\r\n\r\nthe Kallang Airport was vacated, it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be turned into a district hospital. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  why  this  has  been  completely  turned  down.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the election, I think the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister said that this building was going  to\r\n\r\nbe  used  as a transit camp for persons displaced  by\r\n\r\nfire  or by a benevolent Government who want to build\r\n\r\nnew  houses. I think someone has since persuaded  him\r\n\r\nthat  this  building is too good  to  be  used  as  a\r\n\r\ntransit camp. I ask, what use is this going to be put\r\n\r\nto?  I  find that it is to be used not as a  district\r\n\r\nhospital   but  as  headquarters  for   the   Malayan\r\n\r\nAuxiliary Air Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

The\r\n\r\nprovision  of  $1  million to convert  this  building\r\n\r\nwould  turn  it into a first-class hospital  and  the\r\n\r\nother   $2   millions  could  be  used  for  district\r\n\r\nhospitals which are sorely needed in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urgently request that the Minister try and\r\n\r\nchange  the  whole system of building. I myself  have\r\n\r\ntaken it up as a hobby and I know there are ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans  of putting up a building which can be done  at\r\n\r\nhalf the cost of what is being done today without any\r\n\r\ndanger of collapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, once before I said that  hon.  Members\r\n\r\nused  to  come  here with prepared speeches  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  talk  nonsense.  In  this  connection,  I   am\r\n\r\ndismayed  to  see that some Members have not  studied\r\n\r\nthe Budget, have not studied the Estimates at all, or\r\n\r\neven  read  them  correctly. I am  referring  to  the\r\n\r\nremark  made by the Member for Bukit Timah  (Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing Siong) that only $300,000 is provided\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Malay  schools.  Well, he  should  know,  as  an\r\n\r\nelected  Member of this Assembly, that Malay  schools\r\n\r\nare  Government schools. The $300,000 referred to  by\r\n\r\nhim  appears  under  Head D  48,  subhead  5  in  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment    Estimates.    It    clearly     reads: \"Improvements and Extensions to Malay Schools\".  That\r\n\r\ndoes  not  indicate that the Government is  going  to\r\n\r\nspend $300,000 on building one school or two schools.\r\n\r\nIt   is   going   to  be  spent  on  extensions   and\r\n\r\nimprovements  to  the  existing  Malay  schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede), and I think the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong), referred to  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  no  new provision has  been  put  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  for  secondary  schools.  Well,   no   new\r\n\r\nprovision is required because $1,200,000 is available\r\n\r\nas  a revote from 1955. It would be unrealistic if  I\r\n\r\nwere  to  put  in  a figure of, say, half  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars  for two schools when actually the Government\r\n\r\ncannot  hope  to construct those buildings.  Now,  we\r\n\r\nhave - and this formed part of my answer last  time,  I\r\n\r\nthink - seven secondary schools. Two will be  completed\r\n\r\nin   1956  and  plans  have  been  started  for   the\r\n\r\nconstruction of two more secondary schools. I  should\r\n\r\ntell hon. Members that we put into the Estimates what\r\n\r\nthe  Public Works Department can do during the  year,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  putting in some unrealistic  figure  and\r\n\r\nthus  boost  up an unrealistic deficit. I  would  not\r\n\r\nclaim credit for that kind of thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin also says that in Group A in\r\n\r\nthe  Development Estimates there are 36 schools,  and\r\n\r\nthe  cost of each averages $10,000 less than that  of\r\n\r\nthe  18  schools in Group B, but he forgets the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the cost is determined not only by the building\r\n\r\nbut  also  by  piling, the approach roads  and  other\r\n\r\nfactors.  Foundations  may raise  the  cost  in  some\r\n\r\ncases, and extensions to road work may increase it in\r\n\r\nother  cases.  So it is impossible to  lay  down  the\r\n\r\naverage  cost  just  by dividing  the  amount  of  $8\r\n\r\nmillions by 36 schools and $4 millions by 18 schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Seletar (Mr Nair) criticised\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  a  project to  build  a  $2  million\r\n\r\nlibrary and bemoaned the fact that Government has not\r\n\r\nprovided any branches.

That sentiment  I  thoroughly\r\n\r\nendorse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only constructive - if it may be called\r\n\r\nconstructive - suggestion that has been made is by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Paya  Lebar  (Mr  Lim  Koon  Teck)   in\r\n\r\nconnection with the use of the Airport Terminal as  a\r\n\r\nhospital which I shall deal with in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon was very free with his\r\n\r\ncriticisms of the Medical Department. I can only  say\r\n\r\nthat he and also the Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) are\r\n\r\nquite  used  to  casting  and  slinging  mud  without\r\n\r\nascertaining  facts. It is a hobby and a  habit  with\r\n\r\nthem. The Member for Serangoon made a statement  that\r\n\r\ndespite  alterations,  as the Budget  shows - Expenses,\r\n\r\nAlterations and Additions to Hospitals - there is not a\r\n\r\nsingle increase in beds. That is absolutely wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Give me your figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> All alterations are designed to increase\r\n\r\nthe  number  of beds.

That  is\r\n\r\nan exact figure, although the return from the General\r\n\r\nHospital showed about 107. I am being conservative in\r\n\r\nsaying that the increase there by alterations  is  75\r\n\r\nbeds.  This  figure does not include the  new  Mistri\r\n\r\nWing  of 300 beds. Alterations and additions are  now\r\n\r\ncommencing in Kandang Kerbau Hospital to provide  for\r\n\r\nextra beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> How many beds?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Come to me on another day and I will give\r\n\r\nyou  that  information. Another remark he made  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of his rather loose thinking is the  question\r\n\r\nof  wards being built with air-conditioning.  Let  me\r\n\r\nassure him that the new air-conditioned wards in  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital  for first-class  and  second-class\r\n\r\npatients  completed early this year were  planned  by\r\n\r\nthe  previous Government. It is the intention of this\r\n\r\nGovernment to provide one class of accommodation  for\r\n\r\npatients  with minimum comforts, and air-conditioning\r\n\r\nfor medical purposes only. Those who wish to have air-conditioning   will   have  to  seek   that   amenity\r\n\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further statement he made which is wrong and which\r\n\r\nI  wish to correct him is the creation of extra posts\r\n\r\nin  the Budget. He gave as an example posts for  five\r\n\r\nRadiologists. It is necessary to create  extra  posts\r\n\r\neven though there are still vacancies because we  are\r\n\r\nsending our locally domiciled medical men abroad  for\r\n\r\nfurther  education  (for F.R.C.S. degrees)  to  fill\r\n\r\nhigher  posts, and it is therefore necessary to  have\r\n\r\nthese posts vacant when they return. Let me refer the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member to the White Paper No. 40 of 1954  which\r\n\r\nwas  a  report  of  the former Government  under  the\r\n\r\nchairmanship, I think, of Sir Han Hoe Lim, and  which\r\n\r\nreport was adopted. It said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is necessary, of course, to ensure that when the\r\n\r\nfour  officers are sent on scholarships, there  shall\r\n\r\nbe vacancies for promotion on their return.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>On  the  5th  of July, 1954, that was implemented  by\r\n\r\nanother circular from the Chief Secretary:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That in making proposals for the award of\r\n\r\nscholarships   to   their   departments,   heads   of\r\n\r\ndepartments are required to ensure that there will be\r\n\r\nvacancies  to which the scholars may be  promoted  on\r\n\r\ntheir  return to duty after the successful completion\r\n\r\nof their course of study.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Later,  this directive was further amplified by  this\r\n\r\nGovernment   on  the  17th  of  August,  1955,   when\r\n\r\nreferring to scholarships. It said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The basis for award is that the individual officer\r\n\r\nshall  be assisted thereby to gain an Honours  degree\r\n\r\nor  equivalent primary qualification which will  make\r\n\r\nhim  eligible  for immediate promotion  to  a  higher\r\n\r\nappointment in the public service\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and referring to the Fellowship courses, it stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The basis for award is that the individual officer\r\n\r\non not becoming immediately eligible for promotion on\r\n\r\nthe  successful  completion of his  course  of  study\r\n\r\nshall  be  assisted  to attain  the  necessary  post-selection  or  postgraduate or  special  professional\r\n\r\nqualification  for  eventual promotion  to  a  higher\r\n\r\ngrade of post.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It therefore follows that if, in any one case, it is\r\n\r\ndecided by this Assembly to delete the provision  for\r\n\r\na  new superscale post, the effect will be to prevent\r\n\r\nlocal officers proceeding overseas for higher studies\r\n\r\nduring the coming year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we will go to the reference made to the hospital\r\n\r\nat  Kallang which has been loosely referred to by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin (Mr Ede), and I believe  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Ponggol-Tampenis (Mr Goh Chew Chua)  who\r\n\r\ncalled  it a paper hospital. I can only suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Ponggol-Tampenis is used to  burning\r\n\r\npaper houses as a hobby. I have already made a public\r\n\r\nannouncement that the Government intends to  build  a\r\n\r\ndistrict hospital, and since my filling the  post  as\r\n\r\nMinister for Health, I have sought proper sites.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  site we thought that might be used was one  in\r\n\r\nKatong Road, somewhere near the Post Office, which is\r\n\r\na  coconut  plantation, but we found it a little  too\r\n\r\nsmall and required a lot of piling. Subsequently,  we\r\n\r\nthought  that the site on the vacated Kallang Airport\r\n\r\nwould  be a useful one and after tests had been made,\r\n\r\nwe  found it suitable. The Member for Paya Lebar (Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Koon  Teck) suggested that the Airport  Terminal\r\n\r\ncould be used for a hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me assure him that it is much, much too small  to\r\n\r\nbe  used  as  a  hospital. The site that  I  hope  to\r\n\r\nacquire and on which I hope to build my hospital when\r\n\r\nplans  are ready comprises an area of fifteen  acres.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Paya Lebar says that he has taken  up\r\n\r\nbuilding as a hobby. I think it is more than a  hobby\r\n\r\nwhen  he  suggested  that  we  should  build  cheaper\r\n\r\nhospitals and I can assure him that we do not require\r\n\r\nhis  services to build cheap hospitals. Under Head  D\r\n\r\n52,  subhead 10, item 4 of the Development  Estimates\r\n\r\ngives  a vote of $100,000 for this district hospital,\r\n\r\nbut   the  estimate  that  is  allowed  for   it   is\r\n\r\n$3,200,000. That $100,000 is only to cover  the  work\r\n\r\nwhich  we  anticipate will be completed in  1956.  If\r\n\r\nindeed we have done more work than necessary, we  can\r\n\r\nalways  go back to the original Estimate and ask  for\r\n\r\nmore.  There  is nothing to prevent us exceeding  the\r\n\r\n$100,000 voted, because we have already estimated, as\r\n\r\nI have said, $3,200,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the cottage hospitals that were suggested by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede). This may show  him\r\n\r\nwhere  he  is  wrong.  He said that  the  Progressive\r\n\r\nParty,  or  the  previous Government,  had  suggested\r\n\r\ncottage  hospitals. The suggestion that was  made  in\r\n\r\nthe  Progress Report of the Medical Plan for 1953 was\r\n\r\nfor outpatient-cum-cottage or district hospitals, and\r\n\r\nit went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Colony population is increasing at such a rate\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  intended  now to  develop  outside  the\r\n\r\ncentralised medical institutions ...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>though  the  population  has increased  considerably\r\n\r\nsince 1953. This goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Each of these new divisions would be so designed\r\n\r\nthat they could be expanded into full-sized hospitals\r\n\r\nto   meet   the  growing  needs  of  the   increasing\r\n\r\npopulation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  exactly  what we are  doing  with  the  new\r\n\r\nhospital  at Kallang. The new hospital at Kallang  is\r\n\r\nplanned  to provide for 250 beds in the first  phase,\r\n\r\nand  to increase to 450 beds when funds and staff are\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of criticism have also been launched against\r\n\r\nthe increase that has been provided for in the Budget\r\n\r\nunder  the Medical Heads. This increase under Medical\r\n\r\nHead D 52 is to keep up with expansion which is daily\r\n\r\ngrowing and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsidering  the scope of expansion, the increase  of\r\n\r\nless  than half a million dollars shows that  a  real\r\n\r\neffort  has  been made to cut out all  but  essential\r\n\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  when  I  raised my hand just now signifying  my\r\n\r\nintention  to  speak,  I  believe  the  hon.

I think\r\n\r\nthey will be disappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But coming to business, it would appear, from the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates for 1956, that  provision  for\r\n\r\nall  necessary  things has been made  for  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  They  are  only left to be  implemented.  But\r\n\r\nthere  are  two  things, I observe,  that  have  been\r\n\r\noverlooked  by  the Government. They are  electricity\r\n\r\nand  telephones. I know quite a lot of villages which\r\n\r\nhave  no  such facilities at all. In my constituency,\r\n\r\nparticularly,   there  are  seven  villages   without\r\n\r\nelectricity   and   telephones.   The   inconvenience\r\n\r\nsuffered  by  the villagers as a result  of  this,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  had  better be left to the  imagination  than\r\n\r\nnarrated. I have brought this matter up once or twice\r\n\r\nbefore in the Rural Board, but it seems nothing could\r\n\r\nbe  done  because of technical factors and economics.\r\n\r\nWell,   Sir,  we  are  no  technicians;  we  are   no\r\n\r\neconomists; we are \"orang2 ulu\" pure and simple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

A great number of the\r\n\r\npoints  which  have been raised in this  debate  have\r\n\r\nbeen answered by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues on the Government Benches. A number of\r\n\r\nthem  are the subject of motions which will be  taken\r\n\r\nin  the  Committee stage, and I think I can,  in  all\r\n\r\nfairness, say that the bulk of the remainder could be\r\n\r\nanswered by a careful reading of Cmd. Paper No. 28 of\r\n\r\n1955, of my speech on the 9th of November, and of the\r\n\r\nEstimates  themselves. I will, if I  may,  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to answer some specific points which were\r\n\r\nmade  in the course of the debate and which have  not\r\n\r\nyet been replied to in full.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the 1954 accounts mentioned by my hon.\r\n\r\nFriend the Member for Seletar (Mr Nair). These  were\r\n\r\ncompleted  in May, the audit was finished in  August,\r\n\r\nand they are now in the hands of the Printer and will\r\n\r\nvery  soon  be  in  the  hands  of  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of the investments by the\r\n\r\nSpecial Reserve Fund, I deplore, just as much as  the\r\n\r\nMember for Seletar does, the depreciation in value of\r\n\r\nthe Special Reserve. I would point out, however, that\r\n\r\nit  is a long-term reserve. We hope that we will  not\r\n\r\nhave to realise it for some time to come and there is\r\n\r\nreason  to  hope that the value of the securities  in\r\n\r\nwhich  it is invested will have appreciated  by  that\r\n\r\ntime. There are certain advantages in investing these\r\n\r\nfunds  overseas.  They  are invested  in  the  London\r\n\r\nmarket.  They  can be realised as and  when  we  want\r\n\r\nthem.  I  do  not think funds invested  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  have  that same liquidity. If  they  had  been\r\n\r\ninvested  in Singapore, I would not like to speculate\r\n\r\nas to their value at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been accused by many Members on the other\r\n\r\nside of not having practised what we have preached in\r\n\r\nour  various statements throughout the year about the\r\n\r\nnecessity for economy in the Government service. Now,\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think  that that is altogether  fair.  In\r\n\r\ndrawing  up  the Estimates this year,  we  have  made\r\n\r\nstrenuous   efforts  to  limit  Government  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure as much as possible. If Members will look\r\n\r\nat  the  Estimates, they will see,  apart  from  some\r\n\r\nextraordinary items\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike contributions to the Central Provident Fund  and\r\n\r\nincreased  provision for grants  in  aid  to  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools and so on, that the recurrent expenditure has\r\n\r\nbeen  kept  within the level of the  1955  Estimates.\r\n\r\nNow,  that  in  itself represents a very considerable\r\n\r\neconomy  when  one  takes into  account  the  natural\r\n\r\nexpansion of the government machine during the course\r\n\r\nof  a  year, and I can assure Members that  heads  of\r\n\r\ndepartments  will  be required to keep  within  these\r\n\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I think Members will see, if they look with\r\n\r\ncare  at  the  Estimates  of Expenditure,  that  very\r\n\r\nconsiderable economies have been effected in  Special\r\n\r\nExpenditure. Our Special Expenditure in 1956 will  be\r\n\r\nreduced  to  $16 millions, excluding  revotes  and  a\r\n\r\ncontribution to development. That represents  a  very\r\n\r\nconsiderable economy. It has been achieved by  asking\r\n\r\nheads  of departments to exclude from their estimates\r\n\r\nprovision  for  any service which is  not  absolutely\r\n\r\nimperative in 1956 and which can be postponed until a\r\n\r\nlater  year, and to exclude any provision or  service\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Estimates which cannot be spent  owing  to\r\n\r\ndelays  in  drawing up plans, or for items when  they\r\n\r\nknow cannot be delivered in 1956 even if ordered. The\r\n\r\nobject  of this exercise is to ensure that the  money\r\n\r\nwhich  we have available in 1956 will be used to  the\r\n\r\nbest advantage, and that the Estimates of Expenditure\r\n\r\nwill  not be inflated by items on which money  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  spent and which would, by their very existence in\r\n\r\nthe Estimates, freeze funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards personal emoluments, we have been accused\r\n\r\nthat  we  have failed to cut down the number  of  new\r\n\r\nappointments, and that the Government staff shows  no\r\n\r\ntendency to decrease; that it, in fact, has increased\r\n\r\nat  a rate faster than in previous years; and that  a\r\n\r\nvery  considerable amount of money is being spent  on\r\n\r\nexpatriates and so on. Well, Sir, I can say,  in  all\r\n\r\nearnestness, that we did go through the Estimates  of\r\n\r\nPersonal  Emoluments this year with a fine tooth-comb\r\n\r\nand  also  took out of the Estimates any appointments\r\n\r\nor proposals for new posts which were not regarded as\r\n\r\nabsolutely imperative for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe efficient conduct of government business in 1956.\r\n\r\nWe  did, at the same time, take into account the fact\r\n\r\nthat to implement the development plans of the social\r\n\r\nservices, extra staff would have to be provided,  but\r\n\r\nat  the same time we did ensure that only the minimum\r\n\r\nof  this  extra staff required for the implementation\r\n\r\nof these services was, in fact, included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, I can say, in all sincerity,\r\n\r\nthat  we have drawn up these Estimates in such a  way\r\n\r\nas to practise the maximum possible economy in 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Development Estimates, we\r\n\r\nhave  endeavoured  to cut our coat according  to  our\r\n\r\ncloth. That, I think, will be accepted as very  sound\r\n\r\npolicy - colonial, Labour Front, or P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> God forbid!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I appreciate from what the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar said earlier that cutting  one's  coat\r\n\r\naccording  to  one's  cloth  was  not  a  fundamental\r\n\r\nconcept  of  the  economic  planning  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nNaturally,  as  always  happens,  certain   essential\r\n\r\nservices  have had to be held back - not  abolished  or\r\n\r\nabandoned - but  merely held back until  later  in  the\r\n\r\nyear or until next year. This, I think, has caused  a\r\n\r\ncertain  amount of heart-burning amongst  Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition, and certainly amongst my  colleagues\r\n\r\non  the Ministerial Bench, but we have made a note to\r\n\r\nallocate   any   money   likely   to   be   available\r\n\r\nsubsequently  to those services which  have,  in  our\r\n\r\nopinion,  a  high  priority and I think  it  will  be\r\n\r\nagreed  that  in  devoting - and  I  am  speaking  from\r\n\r\nmemory - 34 per cent of the available funds for capital\r\n\r\nworks  to  Education and 25 per cent to  Medical  and\r\n\r\nHealth, we have not neglected these services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also said that, halfway through the year, we\r\n\r\nwill probably find that progress in some respects has\r\n\r\nnot  been  as  rapid as we had hoped  and  that  some\r\n\r\nsavings  are  available. If that  proves  to  be  the\r\n\r\ncase - as   I   think  it  will - we  will  introduce   a\r\n\r\nsupplementary  Budget  and  re-allocate   the   money\r\n\r\navailable,  thus bringing forward those  items  which\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerely noted in the Development Estimates with  token\r\n\r\nvotes,  or perhaps which have had to be kept  out  of\r\n\r\nthe Estimates altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I expected, when I drafted my Budget speech on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of  Estimates showing a  deficit  of  $22\r\n\r\nmillions, I would be accused of crying wolf once more\r\n\r\nin   the   established  tradition  of  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretaries of Singapore, but I did think that I  had\r\n\r\nbeen at some pains in my speech to point out that the\r\n\r\ndays  of  large deficits being converted  into  large\r\n\r\nsurpluses  have now passed and that we are now  faced\r\n\r\nwith  the hard reality of actual deficits. I  am  not\r\n\r\nsufficiently foolhardy to endeavour to estimate  what\r\n\r\nthe  actual deficit will be, and I hope that  I  made\r\n\r\nthat clear in my speech. At the same time, I think  I\r\n\r\nmade  it  clear that there will be an actual  deficit\r\n\r\nand that we must face that fact. I also tried to make\r\n\r\nit  clear, and I think the figures I quoted  bear  me\r\n\r\nout,  that unless steps are taken to reduce and cover\r\n\r\nthe  gap,  we  will  be faced with  an  even  greater\r\n\r\ndeficit  in  the years to come, not because  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen   extravagant  but  merely  because  the  social\r\n\r\nservice plans, which are regarded as so important for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  must  be implemented and  that  recurrent\r\n\r\ncosts will increase, no matter what steps we take  to\r\n\r\nreduce expenditure to an absolute minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there were certain points raised in the course\r\n\r\nof  the  debate - the  question  of  entertainment  and\r\n\r\ntransport  allowances for Ministers - which  I  confess\r\n\r\ntook  me  by  surprise, because I never thought  that\r\n\r\nelected  representatives of the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwho   appreciate  so  much  the  value  of   personal\r\n\r\nrelations  in  their commercial transactions,  should\r\n\r\nhave complained of, or drawn attention to, and indeed\r\n\r\ncriticised,  the very small amounts which  were  made\r\n\r\navailable  in the Estimates for 1956 to Ministers  of\r\n\r\nthe     Government.     But     the     point     was\r\n\r\nraised - regrettably - and   has   been    satisfactorily\r\n\r\ndisposed  of  by  my  colleague the  Chief  Minister,\r\n\r\nthough it will again be taken\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup,  I fear, in the course of the Committee stage  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill. I will speak then at greater length on the\r\n\r\ndetails of the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards hospital facilities, criticisms made of\r\n\r\nour programme for 1956 have been dealt with at length\r\n\r\nby  my colleague the Minister for Health (Mr Braga).\r\n\r\nIt  struck me as astonishing that responsible Members\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition, first of all, had not  read  the\r\n\r\nEstimates properly. Most of them have motor cars, and\r\n\r\nalthough  I admit the increased tax of five  cents  a\r\n\r\ngallon   on  petrol  would  probably  curtail   their\r\n\r\nmovements  to  a  certain extent, Singapore  being  a\r\n\r\nsmall  place, could they not have gone  down  to  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital and to other hospitals to find  out\r\n\r\nprecisely what is being done with the money  that  is\r\n\r\nbeing  spent?  It  struck me as astonishing  to  hear\r\n\r\nMembers say that money spent on alterations to  wards\r\n\r\nwas  not  going to result in any increase in hospital\r\n\r\nbeds.  That  is  a  most  astonishing  statement - that\r\n\r\nanybody in their senses would spend money on hospital\r\n\r\nfacilities  without meeting the major requirement  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, which is an increase of beds in hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards district hospitals, complaints have been\r\n\r\nmade that we are making no progress with the work. It\r\n\r\nhas  been explained that we have changed our plan and\r\n\r\nthat  we are now going to Kallang and I think  nobody\r\n\r\nwould  care  to  question  that  decision,  which  is\r\n\r\nputting  a  district hospital right in the middle  of\r\n\r\none  of the major centres of population of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe site that has been provided will cost no money to\r\n\r\nthe  Government, but the site at Bukit Panjang  which\r\n\r\nwould not, in any case, have been suitable, had to be\r\n\r\nacquired,  as  would  sites in  other  parts  of  the\r\n\r\nisland.  That  is the major advantage  of  putting  a\r\n\r\ndistrict hospital in Kallang, that the site is  free.\r\n\r\nBut before a start is made to build a hospital there,\r\n\r\nplans  must  first  of  all be  prepared.  The  plans\r\n\r\nprepared  for Bukit Panjang would not do.  New  plans\r\n\r\nhave  to be prepared, and on the site which has  been\r\n\r\nreclaimed  from swamp only some 30 years ago,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  sink  piles which will enable it to  support  the\r\n\r\nbuildings  which will constitute a district hospital.\r\n\r\nIt  is  for  that  purpose that the  money  has  been\r\n\r\nentered in the Estimates this year - $100,000 for  the\r\n\r\npreparation of the site to enable us to proceed  with\r\n\r\nthe building after the plans have been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague the Minister for Education (Mr Chew\r\n\r\nSwee  Kee) has dealt with criticisms which have  been\r\n\r\nmade  of the construction of schools. Three secondary\r\n\r\nschools  in a programme of seven have been completed.\r\n\r\nTenders are now about to go out for two others.  They\r\n\r\nwill be completed in 1956 and sites for the final two\r\n\r\nschools  in  this programme are now  the  subject  of\r\n\r\nnegotiation. Rapid progress has been made  in  recent\r\n\r\nweeks in that connection and we confidently expect to\r\n\r\nhave class rooms for all these four schools in actual\r\n\r\noperation by the end of 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the primary schools - 36 schools in Group\r\n\r\nA - they  will all be completed early in 1956.  The  18\r\n\r\nschools  in  Group B will be completed  in  the  same\r\n\r\nyear,  and we hope work will have started, admittedly\r\n\r\ntowards  the end of the year, on 18 schools in  Group\r\n\r\nC.  That, I think, is greater progress than has  been\r\n\r\nmade by any previous Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the burning question of housing, we were\r\n\r\naccused  of  having  made no progress  with  low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing in the rural areas. We have not neglected low-cost  housing  in  the rural areas.  We  have  indeed\r\n\r\napproved plans and are about to start a pilot  scheme\r\n\r\nfor  low-cost housing at Bukit Panjang.  If  that  is\r\n\r\nsuccessful,   we  will  undertake  similar   projects\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  rural areas in the  island,  thereby\r\n\r\ntaking  the  population  away  from  the  centre  and\r\n\r\ndispersing  it close to their places of work  in  the\r\n\r\nrural districts in the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of subsidising housing,\r\n\r\nMembers  are already aware that by granting loans  of\r\n\r\nfour per cent for 60 years and of three per cent  for\r\n\r\n40 years, we are giving a very substantial subsidy in\r\n\r\nso far as nobody could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nborrow on these terms for that length of time.  Again\r\n\r\nwe  subsidise housing very considerably - and  this  is\r\n\r\nnot  new - in  so far as we pay the cost of all  sites,\r\n\r\npreparation,  levelling,  piling,  and  purchase - over\r\n\r\n$25,000. Now that indeed is a very important item.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions were asked about slum clearance. I can\r\n\r\nassure  the hon. Member who raised the question  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  proceeding with our plans. We are, in  fact,\r\n\r\nabout to come to the Assembly with proposals for what\r\n\r\nis   called  by  the  Singapore  Improvement   Trust,\r\n\r\nProgramme  No.  8. Now that is for  the  clearing  of\r\n\r\nslums  in, I think, Manila and Short Streets and  for\r\n\r\nthe construction of some houses on the open ground at\r\n\r\nKallang. That programme will cost $23.6 millions  and\r\n\r\nthe Assembly will be asked to approve funds for that.\r\n\r\nOut  of that sum, $16 millions only will be loans and\r\n\r\n$7  millions will be subsidy. Now I do not think that\r\n\r\ncan  be called ungenerous - a third of the cost of  the\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards rural development, I am afraid I cannot\r\n\r\ntell  you  exactly just how much has  been  spent  on\r\n\r\ncapital works in the rural areas, but I can tell  you\r\n\r\nhow  much has been provided in the Estimates for  the\r\n\r\nRural   Board  since  1947.  Now  this  is   a   most\r\n\r\ninteresting table. In 1947 the Estimates of the Rural\r\n\r\nBoard showed $1.4 millions; in 1948 $2.2 millions; in\r\n\r\n1953  it had risen to $5.1 millions; in 1954  it  was\r\n\r\n$6.7 millions; in 1955 it was $7.7 millions, and next\r\n\r\nyear  it  will  be $8.9 millions. Now  $8.9  millions\r\n\r\nspent  in  one way or another on the rural  areas  is\r\n\r\nquite  a  considerable sum, and  we  will  of  course\r\n\r\ncontinue  to devote as much money as we  can  to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the  rural  areas.  I  have  figures\r\n\r\nprovided for the last two years as far as the capital\r\n\r\ndevelopment  is  concerned. Last year  the  Estimates\r\n\r\nincluded $3.03 millions, purely capital works in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas.  This year - again I speak from  memory - I\r\n\r\nthink it is $4.4 millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague the Minister for Communications and\r\n\r\nWorks  (Mr  Thomas)  has dealt at  length  with  the\r\n\r\nquestion of a Committee which has been set up to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreconsider the standards of construction. The  latest\r\n\r\ninformation about that is that the Committee  on  the\r\n\r\nstandards  of  construction in schools  has  achieved\r\n\r\nvery considerable economies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other matters which have been raised.\r\n\r\nAlthough  they are the subject of motions,  I  should\r\n\r\nperhaps  deal with them. I realise that if funds  for\r\n\r\nlighting  of  Goodwood  Hill  were  entered  in   the\r\n\r\nEstimates, it would immediately cause an outcry,  and\r\n\r\nI  questioned  this.  I am living  in  Goodwood  Hill\r\n\r\nmyself!  I  must say that very few of  the  residents\r\n\r\nthere have large high-powered cars. We all happen  to\r\n\r\nbe Government servants, and our cars are very small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Humber - a small car?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I queried that provision when the\r\n\r\nEstimates came up. It was some months ago now  and  I\r\n\r\nasked  \"Why  must it go in? It seems unnecessary.\"  I\r\n\r\nwill  go  into  the matter in greater detail  in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  stage. It is as a result of  an  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  the  City  Council who wish to remove  the  gas\r\n\r\nlighting  at Goodwood Hill, and we are under  certain\r\n\r\nobligations  in  1956 to allow  the  removal  of  the\r\n\r\nsupply of gas and to make the necessary provision for\r\n\r\nelectric lighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of land, I think that is the subject\r\n\r\nof  a  motion by my friend the Member for Telok  Ayer\r\n\r\n(Mr  R. Jumabhoy), and I will give him the necessary\r\n\r\ninformation in detail in the Committee stage; but, in\r\n\r\nfact,  as  far as land is concerned, the estimate  is\r\n\r\nbased  very closely on the estimated requirements  of\r\n\r\nvarious departments for development, for the purchase\r\n\r\nof  sites, and for provision of sites for development\r\n\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of the acquisition and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of sites for resettlement, the  Estimate\r\n\r\nis  again  drawn up on the same careful basis  and  I\r\n\r\nwill give details later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has dealt with the question of\r\n\r\norganisation  and  methods advisers.  We  are  making\r\n\r\nevery effort to get them, and when they do arrive I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink  they  will  be  able  to  make  a  substantial\r\n\r\ncontribution to effecting economies in the Government\r\n\r\nservice. This is a task which really requires  expert\r\n\r\nmen who have had experience of this sort of thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of an Industrial Development\r\n\r\nCorporation and a research institute is under  active\r\n\r\nconsideration at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of personal emoluments of $98.7\r\n\r\nmillions estimated this year - though not all  will  be\r\n\r\nspent - I  cannot tell you how much will  be  spent  on\r\n\r\nexpatriate officers. I only know that they  represent\r\n\r\napproximately between three and four per cent of  the\r\n\r\nnumber of people employed by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, finally, we come to the question of taxation.\r\n\r\nMy  presentation of this item has been criticised  as\r\n\r\nbeing irregular, unconstitutional, unorthodox. It has\r\n\r\nbeen  said that my \"Budget leaks\" have increased  the\r\n\r\nfeeling of lack of confidence in Singapore. First  of\r\n\r\nall, I should say that when this Assembly met for the\r\n\r\nfirst time, His Excellency the Governor in his speech\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we were going to undertake immediately  a\r\n\r\nreview of the revenue potential of the Colony, and in\r\n\r\nfact  we  were  doing that. It has  been  given  some\r\n\r\npublicity  from time to time. In these circumstances,\r\n\r\nI thought it only right and proper that I should give\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Assembly  some  indication  of  the\r\n\r\ninterim results of our researches. I did endeavour in\r\n\r\nmy  speech to give an outline of what I thought  were\r\n\r\nthe  fundamental principles of taxation for Singapore\r\n\r\nand I have not so far heard them criticised. In fact,\r\n\r\nif  I  may  say so, I think they can be  regarded  as\r\n\r\nunexceptional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Labour Front Coalition Government has\r\n\r\ncertain  principles of taxation which were enunciated\r\n\r\nin  their election programme. Circumstances forced us\r\n\r\nto  abandon these principles temporarily, to put  the\r\n\r\ncart  before the horse of taxation; or to use another\r\n\r\nmetaphor,  change  the  batting  order - not  to  throw\r\n\r\nanybody out of the team but merely to bring No. 3  up\r\n\r\nand  put  him  as No. 1 because No. 1 happens  to  be\r\n\r\ntemporarily indisposed. That is why I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntold  you in some detail what had passed through  our\r\n\r\nminds  and in our deliberations before we were forced\r\n\r\nto  introduce  increases  in indirect  taxation,  and\r\n\r\nbefore  we  were able to introduce those measures  of\r\n\r\ndirect  taxation which we intend to do in the future.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think any harm has been done.  People  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  far  more able perhaps than  most  of  us\r\n\r\nhere, can size up with a great deal of accuracy  what\r\n\r\nmeasures of taxation any government can bring  in  at\r\n\r\nany given time. The mere fact that we have outlined a\r\n\r\ngenuine  policy of taxation will not have the  effect\r\n\r\nof  lowering confidence. It will have the  effect  of\r\n\r\nstrengthening  confidence in the  Administration.  As\r\n\r\nregards  the  proposals themselves, I  do  not  think\r\n\r\nanybody  can criticise them as being harsh or  likely\r\n\r\nto bear hardly on any section of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of yield, I have gone into\r\n\r\nthat  with  very great care, with the  assistance  of\r\n\r\nexperts from the Customs Department who have been  at\r\n\r\nthis  job all their lives. There will certainly be  a\r\n\r\nslight   contraction   in   consumption.   That    is\r\n\r\ninevitable,  but  it  will be  temporary.  But  I  do\r\n\r\nconfidently believe that the Estimates which  I  have\r\n\r\ngiven  of  yield will materialise in  the  course  of\r\n\r\n1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say that gin was not forgotten.\r\n\r\nWe  considered the possibility of increasing the  tax\r\n\r\non  gin. Gin of all liquors consumed in Singapore is\r\n\r\nstill  going  steadily down as far as consumption  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.  I  felt  that to  impose  a  considerable\r\n\r\nincrease  of  tax on gin would merely accelerate  the\r\n\r\ndownward trend of consumption. Again, as far as I  am\r\n\r\naware, gin is no real substitute for whisky or brandy\r\n\r\nor samsu -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There speaks the expert!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Thank you! I doubt very much whether the\r\n\r\nincrease of tax on these other liquors will  cause  a\r\n\r\nmovement towards gin. In any case, the position  will\r\n\r\nbe kept under review and should there be any tendency\r\n\r\nin  that  direction, we will, of course,  immediately\r\n\r\ntake steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards champagne, I doubt very much whether the\r\n\r\nconsumption of champagne is a material factor in  the\r\n\r\nlife or revenue of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still wines: It was suggested that we had had to\r\n\r\nreduce  this  duty  some time  in  the  past  because\r\n\r\nconsumption  was going down. That is perfectly  true.\r\n\r\nConsumption did go down slightly but I think that was\r\n\r\ndue   to  economic  causes  rather  than  consumption\r\n\r\ncauses.  In  any case, during the last two  or  three\r\n\r\nyears, consumption has mounted very considerably, and\r\n\r\nnow  there  is a definite market for still  wines  of\r\n\r\nunder 26 per cent of alcohol and I think that we were\r\n\r\non  perfectly sound and safe grounds in restoring the\r\n\r\ntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards estate duty, we did consider all the\r\n\r\nfacts  you  have mentioned and we are still convinced\r\n\r\nthat  from the short-term point of view no harm  will\r\n\r\ncome  from increasing estate duty in the way we  have\r\n\r\ndone and we hope that the Federation will be able  to\r\n\r\nsee  their  way sometime in the future to join  hands\r\n\r\nwith us in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these are my comments on the Estimates. Finally,\r\n\r\nI do not think we are myopic, hesitant or that I am a\r\n\r\nScottish  butterfly  wearing hobnailed  boots.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  impenitent about it. I think  these  are  good\r\n\r\nEstimates. They are not colonial estimates. They  are\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates  of  this  Government,  reached  after\r\n\r\nconsultation    on    a    basis    of    Ministerial\r\n\r\nresponsibility. As regards form, I can  think  of  no\r\n\r\nbetter form than the form in which they are drawn up.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time I have made a study of the way  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  are  drawn up in other  countries,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  I  can safely say that the Estimates here  are\r\n\r\ndrawn  up  in even greater detail than in  any  other\r\n\r\ncountry  that I can name; and indeed, as far  as  the\r\n\r\nquestions  which  my  friend the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar raised, if he would only pause to think of  it,\r\n\r\nhe  would appreciate and understand what the  various\r\n\r\nsub-heads  mean, or if he could not find  a  solution\r\n\r\nafter a little cogitation, he had only to come to  my\r\n\r\noffice and say, \"Look here, can you tell me what this\r\n\r\nis all about?\", and he would be informed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I am sorry to have taken up so much time\r\n\r\nand I formally move that the Bill be read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.
