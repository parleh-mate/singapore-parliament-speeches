M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> It is not clear, Sir, what\r\n\r\nmeasures  the hon. Member has in mind. In  Australia\r\n\r\nand New Zealand, where geographical position confers\r\n\r\na  distinct  advantage, there is  a  system  of  tax\r\n\r\nclearances  whereby shipping and aircraft  operators\r\n\r\nare   prohibited  from  issuing  passenger   tickets\r\n\r\nwithout   the  production  of  a  certificate   that\r\n\r\noutstanding income tax has been paid. Limited  forms\r\n\r\nof  this  system  exist in India, Pakistan  and  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States, but Ceylon relies on the same powers\r\n\r\nas  exist  in the Malayan Income Tax Ordinance.  The\r\n\r\npossibility of introducing a system similar to  that\r\n\r\nexisting  in Australia and New Zealand has been  considered  on a number of occasions. On each occasion,\r\n\r\nhowever, it has been decided not to proceed with the\r\n\r\nproposal for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the ease with which a really determined tax\r\n\r\nevader can leave the territory without\r\n\r\npurchasing a passenger ticket;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the large number of transit passengers visiting\r\n\r\nSingapore for varying periods and the\r\n\r\nvery  large number of residents who leave  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor varying periods;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the difficulty of providing the comparatively\r\n\r\nlarge staff which would be required to\r\n\r\nenforce  such a system at a time when the Department\r\n\r\nis still having the greatest difficulty in obtaining\r\n\r\nstaff for the assessment and collection of tax  from\r\n\r\nresident individuals and companies;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the cost of enforcing the system in terms of\r\n\r\ncash   and   diverted   effort   which   would    be\r\n\r\ndisproportionate to the amount of tax recovered;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) the great inconvenience which would be caused\r\n\r\nto   a  great  number  of  law-abiding  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  have  to  leave  the  territory   on\r\n\r\nbusiness from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I would ask\r\n\r\nwhether  the Financial Secretary would consider,  in\r\n\r\nview of the grave position disclosed by the figures,\r\n\r\nthe   immediate  introduction  of  provisions  which\r\n\r\nprevent a person, who has been in Singapore for more\r\n\r\nthan three months, leaving Malaya - this must be a pan-Malayan measure - without a clearance from the Malayan\r\n\r\nincome tax authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> First of all, Sir, the position is not\r\n\r\ngrave.  The figures which I quoted in answer to  the\r\n\r\nfirst  question  indicate  quite  clearly  that  the\r\n\r\nIncome Tax Department is very rapidly getting on top\r\n\r\nof  this  particular problem.

Any system whereby  shipping\r\n\r\nand  aircraft  operators who are  required  to  have\r\n\r\nincome tax clearance certificates before they  issue\r\n\r\npassenger tickets would require joint\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naction on the part of the Federation.

It deals with the\r\n\r\nnature  and  scope  and method of  imposition  of  a\r\n\r\nluxury  tax.  Clause 8 (1)  prescribes that  the  tax\r\n\r\nshould  be  charged on the wholesale  value  of  all\r\n\r\nchargeable  goods bought under chargeable purchases.\r\n\r\nThe Governor in Council is vested with the power  of\r\n\r\ndeciding what goods shall be subject to tax  and  at\r\n\r\nwhat  rates. Any order in this connection,  however,\r\n\r\nmust  be ratified by the Assembly within seven days.\r\n\r\nClause  8 (4)  defines a chargeable purchase as  \"any\r\n\r\npurchase   made   from  a  wholesale   merchant   or\r\n\r\nmanufacturer  selling by wholesale\". Purchases  made\r\n\r\nby  a  registered wholesale merchant or a registered\r\n\r\nmanufacturer  of goods as stock for business  or  as\r\n\r\nmaterials  are  exempt  from  tax.  Clause   8   (5) \r\n\r\nspecifies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  tax  will become due on delivery  of  the\r\n\r\ngoods  under  the purchase and the seller  shall  be\r\n\r\naccountable  for tax. Clause 8 (6)  states  that  tax\r\n\r\nwill  be  charged  on  the wholesale  value  of  all\r\n\r\nchargeable  goods  imported into the  colony  except\r\n\r\ngoods imported by registered wholesale merchants  or\r\n\r\nmanufacturers. Clause 8 (7)  states the circumstances\r\n\r\nand conditions under which goods may be imported tax\r\n\r\nfree   by   registered   wholesale   merchants   and\r\n\r\nmanufacturers. Clause 8 (9)  exempts from  tax  goods\r\n\r\nimported for re-export or transhipment under certain\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 defines \"wholesale value\" as the price\r\n\r\nwhich, in the opinion of the Comptroller, the  goods\r\n\r\nwould  fetch  on  a sale by wholesale  in  the  open\r\n\r\nmarket in the Colony to a retail trader carrying  on\r\n\r\nbusiness  in the Colony and if it were made  in  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances specified in the First Schedule to the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 deals with the registration of wholesale\r\n\r\nmerchants and manufacturers whose business  includes\r\n\r\nthe  selling of any chargeable goods. Clause 10  (2) \r\n\r\nprovides that a manufacturer who is not required  to\r\n\r\nbe  registered  under  the  Ordinance  shall  be  so\r\n\r\nregistered if he satisfies the Comptroller  that  he\r\n\r\nuses  chargeable goods in substantial quantities  as\r\n\r\nmaterials.  Clause 10 (3)  provides that persons  who\r\n\r\nshould  be registered must make application  to  the\r\n\r\nComptroller.  Clause  10  (4)   provides   that   any\r\n\r\nwholesale  merchant or manufacturer who  finds  that\r\n\r\nthe  proviso to clause 10 (1)  no longer  applies  to\r\n\r\nhim,   shall  immediately  apply  for  registration.\r\n\r\nClause   10  (6)   provides  for  the  issue   of   a\r\n\r\ncertificate of registration, and the Comptroller may\r\n\r\nin  certain circumstances call for security for  the\r\n\r\npayment of tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 contains provisions whereby the\r\n\r\nComptroller  shall exempt a person from registration\r\n\r\nwhen the tax on his purchases shall be not less than\r\n\r\nthe  tax on his sales; in other words, where the tax\r\n\r\npayable on his purchases and importations in respect\r\n\r\nof  stock or materials would be more than the tax he\r\n\r\nwould be accountable for on his sales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 prescribes when a purchase shall be\r\n\r\ndeemed   a  purchase  by  a  registered  wholesale\r\n\r\nmerchant  as stock or by a registered manufacturer\r\n\r\nas materials, and therefore exempt from tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 provides for relief against a double\r\n\r\ncharge of tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 states that, where a registered\r\n\r\nwholesale merchant or manufacturer appropriates or\r\n\r\napplies  any chargeable goods in his ownership  to\r\n\r\nthe purposes of any business carried on by him  of\r\n\r\nselling  chargeable goods by retail or of  letting\r\n\r\nout  chargeable  goods on hire  or  to  any  other\r\n\r\npurpose  not  being  a  sale  of  the  goods,  the\r\n\r\nappropriation or application shall be  treated  as\r\n\r\nif it were a chargeable purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 (1) prescribes that, when any person\r\n\r\nrequired  to  be registered applies  a  chargeable\r\n\r\nprocess,  tax shall be chargeable on the wholesale\r\n\r\nvalue of the resulting goods and shall become  due\r\n\r\non  the completion of the process. The person  who\r\n\r\napplies  the process shall be accountable for  the\r\n\r\ntax.  Clause  15 (2)  exempts persons who  apply  a\r\n\r\nchargeable  process  from accountability  for  tax\r\n\r\nwhen the goods are his property at the time of the\r\n\r\ncompletion of the process, subject, of course,  to\r\n\r\nthe provisions of clause 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 provides that any person who carries\r\n\r\nout  a  chargeable process shall be treated  as  a\r\n\r\nmanufacturer whose business includes  the  selling\r\n\r\nof chargeable goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 states that any retail trader\r\n\r\npurchasing  on a wholesale scale shall be  treated\r\n\r\nas a wholesale merchant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 states that the seller of chargeable\r\n\r\ngoods  under a chargeable purchase shall  add  the\r\n\r\namount due in tax to any invoice issued by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 provides relief for exported goods.\r\n\r\nUnder  subclause  (1)  the Comptroller  may  exempt\r\n\r\nfrom tax goods which would otherwise be chargeable\r\n\r\nif  they  were  exported from  the  colony.  Under\r\n\r\nsubclause  (2)   the Financial Secretary  may  give\r\n\r\ndirections for the payment of an allowance for tax\r\n\r\npaid  or payable in respect of goods exported when\r\n\r\nthe  Comptroller is satisfied that the  conditions\r\n\r\nspecified in the subclause exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen, Sir, that the Bill gives wide\r\n\r\npowers  to  the administration. Any goods  can  be\r\n\r\ndeemed luxury goods and any rate of tax imposed on\r\n\r\nthem  by  the  Governor  in Council,  subject,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, to the approval of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the Comptroller of Customs, who is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the care and management  of  the\r\n\r\ntax,  is  given  wide powers  under  a  number  of\r\n\r\nclauses.   The  wide  discretion  given   to   the\r\n\r\nComptroller has apparently been a cause of anxiety\r\n\r\nto   the  Bar  Council  which  has  addressed  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General and other Members of the Assembly\r\n\r\non  the  subject. In particular, the  Bar  Council\r\n\r\ntakes  objection to the Comptroller's powers under\r\n\r\nclauses 9, 17 and 26. Note has been taken of these\r\n\r\nobjections   and  they  will  be   given   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration  in due course, and  doubtless  when\r\n\r\nthis Bill is sent to Select Committee, the Members\r\n\r\nof  the  Committee will consider their  objections\r\n\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has also given consideration to the\r\n\r\nquestion of local industries and has decided, as a\r\n\r\nmeasure  of encouragement, to exempt from tax  all\r\n\r\ngoods entirely manufactured locally and also goods\r\n\r\nin  respect of which a certain percentage of their\r\n\r\nwholesale  value  has been expended  locally.  The\r\n\r\nnecessary amendments to the text of the Bill  will\r\n\r\nbe moved in Committee in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justification for this Bill is that Government\r\n\r\nwill  have  to tap all sources of revenue  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture,   and  luxury  goods  appear   to   be   a\r\n\r\njustifiable source of revenue. As I said  earlier,\r\n\r\nvery  considerable sums of money  are  spent  each\r\n\r\nyear on goods which cannot, by any stretch of  the\r\n\r\nimagination,   be   deemed   essential   or   even\r\n\r\ndesirable.  If confirmation of this  statement  is\r\n\r\nrequired, one has only to look about one,  in  the\r\n\r\nshop  windows, in the homes of people in Singapore\r\n\r\nand   at  people  proceeding  about  their  lawful\r\n\r\noccasions. That being so, it is only proper that\r\n\r\nGovernment  should have some small  share  of  the\r\n\r\nsums  spent  on luxury goods. A great majority  of\r\n\r\ncountries in the world today impose taxes on goods\r\n\r\nwhich are outside the \"essential\" category. In the\r\n\r\ngreat majority of cases, the tax is imposed on the\r\n\r\nwholesale price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be possible to give any estimate of\r\n\r\nthe possible yield from this tax until it is decided\r\n\r\nwhat commodities should be taxed. In selecting goods\r\n\r\nto  be taxed, careful consideration will be given to\r\n\r\nthe  nature and needs of the entrepot trade.  In  so\r\n\r\nfar as it is possible, having regard to the needs of\r\n\r\nthe  revenue, goods which enter largely  into  trade\r\n\r\nwith  neighbouring countries will be avoided.  Where\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade  goods have to be included,  efforts\r\n\r\nwill be made to reduce inconvenience to traders to a\r\n\r\nminimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was to be expected that this Bill would be a\r\n\r\ncontroversial  measure. It is novel and  involves  a\r\n\r\nradical  departure from previous taxation principles\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. For these reasons, it was decided  to\r\n\r\nallow  a period of time to elapse between the  First\r\n\r\nand  Second  Readings and subsequently to  send  the\r\n\r\nBill  to  Select  Committee. This  will  allow  full\r\n\r\nventilation of views and discussion as to the merits\r\n\r\nand  principles underlying the Bill, both in and out\r\n\r\nof the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with discussion outside the\r\n\r\nAssembly, it has been suggested that the Bill  means\r\n\r\nthe  death  of  free trade in Singapore,  and,  that\r\n\r\nbeing  so,  that  it  would  be  simpler  and   more\r\n\r\nstraightforward to impose import duties right  away.\r\n\r\nIt  certainly  would be simpler,  but  it  would  be\r\n\r\ncontrary    to   the   intentions   of   Government.\r\n\r\nSingapore's prosperity has been built on trade  and,\r\n\r\nno  matter what industrial expansion takes place  in\r\n\r\nthe  future,  will continue to depend on  trade,  on\r\n\r\nfree  trade  and on freedom to trade. Government  is\r\n\r\nfully  aware  of the need not only to  maintain  but\r\n\r\nalso to increase trade. As I have said earlier,  all\r\n\r\nGovernment's  development planning starts  from  the\r\n\r\npremise  that  Singapore must  be  maintained  as  a\r\n\r\ncentre of world trade. In the circumstances,  it  is\r\n\r\nextremely  unlikely that this Government, or  indeed\r\n\r\nany government except one bent on the destruction of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   would  introduce  any   law   or   make\r\n\r\nregulations  under such a law which would  undermine\r\n\r\nthe prosperity of the port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that hon. Members will speak frankly on\r\n\r\nthis  measure so that their views can be  considered\r\n\r\nby  the  Select Committee and by Government  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nhave  before us a Bill to tax luxury goods. Whatever\r\n\r\nits  name,  it is a fundamental departure  from  the\r\n\r\nfree  trade policy of Singapore which has  continued\r\n\r\nfor  over  a  century.  Sir, I hope  the  Government\r\n\r\nMembers  will  forgive me if I am harsh  with  them.\r\n\r\nThey  have  just come into power and that  power  of\r\n\r\nminority  has  been exercised with three  ex-officio\r\n\r\nMembers and four nominated Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already said that there will be\r\n\r\nnew  elections in August. If that is so, is it  wise\r\n\r\non  their part to push through such a Bill which  is\r\n\r\njust  like committing a crime on Singapore? It is  a\r\n\r\ndeparture from principles and that is why I  say  it\r\n\r\nis a crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I might also say that the present Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot  claim that  they  represent  the\r\n\r\ntrading interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> We do not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> They will say, \"Why? We do not\r\n\r\ncare.\"  But I will say this: as Singapore exists  on\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade,  it  is trade that  brings  in  the\r\n\r\nmoney,  and  the workers, the wage-earners  and  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  can only flourish by working together  hand\r\n\r\nin   hand.  We  have  no  natural  resources,   none\r\n\r\nwhatsoever.  How  far  and to  what  extent  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  going to tax? There is a  limit  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  reached  this  limit - that  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nforced,  by  their extravagance, to  kill  the  free\r\n\r\ntrade policy of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is luxury? The term \"luxury goods\" has\r\n\r\nnot  been defined. If the Government wants to  bring\r\n\r\nin  a  few  items  under this category,  as  it  has\r\n\r\nalready  done with motor-cars, by all means  describe\r\n\r\nwhat  are  luxury goods and place an  imposition  on\r\n\r\nthem. But to pass this Bill and give such powers  to\r\n\r\nthe Government or any future government, there is  a\r\n\r\ndanger  that  it  might  mishandle  the  powers  and\r\n\r\neverything  might be included under the category  of\r\n\r\nluxury goods, because money is necessary to run  the\r\n\r\ngovernment.  It  is  said that  safeguards  will  be\r\n\r\nprovided\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  will ensure that the Government will  not  do\r\n\r\nthis  or  that  in  order to preserve  our  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade. What is the guarantee that another government\r\n\r\nwill  not do this or that since the Ordinance is  in\r\n\r\nforce?  We on the Opposition Benches are not willing\r\n\r\nto give such powers to the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to produce money you have to spend first on\r\n\r\nstarting  a  department. You have  to  have  a  vast\r\n\r\nestablishment.  You have to have  bonded  warehouses\r\n\r\nultimately if not immediately. This is necessary  if\r\n\r\nmoney  is  to  come in. We must have inspectors  and\r\n\r\nclerks,  etc. for these warehouses. Then,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nhave to guard against corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been in business here since 1916. I\r\n\r\nhave  been  President  of  the  Indian  Chamber   of\r\n\r\nCommerce   for  several  years.  I  have   been   to\r\n\r\nE.C.A.F.E. conferences and I have heard  about  the\r\n\r\ntrading  conditions of other countries  and  I  have\r\n\r\ncompared   ours  with  theirs.  With   what   little\r\n\r\nexperience  that I have, I would urge the Government\r\n\r\nnot  to  proceed with this Bill. I am glad that  the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary has said that  some  time  will\r\n\r\nelapse  before  this measure will be brought  before\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  and that a Select Committee  will  be\r\n\r\nappointed  to consider it. All this is good,  but  I\r\n\r\nwould  ask,  \"Why is all this necessary?\"  How  much\r\n\r\nmore  money is wanted during the next 8 months while\r\n\r\nthis  Government remains in power? It can raise  the\r\n\r\nmoney by income tax or any other tax but not by this\r\n\r\nLuxury Tax Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, who will suffer as a result of the imposition\r\n\r\nof  this  luxury tax on goods? The majority  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation on this small island are the workers  and\r\n\r\nwage-earners. Sir, I have never been personal in  my\r\n\r\nremarks,  but I would like to quote the  remarks  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Communications and Works  which  I\r\n\r\nread  yesterday in the Press.

Sir, in conclusion, I would request  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  not to proceed with this Bill  which  is\r\n\r\nnot in the interests of the colony or the masses  or\r\n\r\nanyone else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.36 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthis measure unreservedly. The Member for Telok Ayer\r\n\r\nsays - and  he speaks rightly - that there is no  person\r\n\r\non this side of the House who represents trade. That\r\n\r\nis true, Sir, but I would also add that though we do\r\n\r\nnot  represent trade, we are and have  always  shown\r\n\r\nourselves  to  be very conscious of  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  survives  by virtue of  the  activity  of\r\n\r\ncapital through trade and commerce in this territory\r\n\r\nand  that our record does indicate that we have been\r\n\r\nconscious of this, and we are anxious that  no  harm\r\n\r\nshall be done to this aspect of our economic life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, that the Member for Telok Ayer's\r\n\r\nfears  are grounded on the fact that Government  has\r\n\r\nnot  shown  its  hand as to what it believes  or  it\r\n\r\nconsiders  to  be  luxuries; but I  would  draw  his\r\n\r\nattention  to this, Sir: this Bill is in the  nature\r\n\r\nof  the  overall law which will control the  tax  on\r\n\r\nluxuries,  but in fact the luxuries will be  defined\r\n\r\nwhen the tax is applied; and seven days after it  is\r\n\r\napplied,  this  House  will  have  to  confirm   the\r\n\r\ndecision. That is necessary, Sir, so that this  step\r\n\r\nshould, first of all, be progressive, and, secondly,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  now disclose what is in mind before  the\r\n\r\nBill  is  passed and thereby gives the  importer  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to pile up goods which may or may not be\r\n\r\ntaxed afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House that the question of\r\n\r\ntaxation on individual objects, subject to this  tax\r\n\r\nproposed by Government, is still in the hands of the\r\n\r\nHouse; and supposing we bring in a tax on radios  in\r\n\r\ntwo or three months' time,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  within  seven  days this House  will  have  to\r\n\r\ndecide  whether or not radios are a luxury,  and  if\r\n\r\nthey  are,  whether they are appropriate objects  in\r\n\r\nthe  existing  circumstances for the application  of\r\n\r\nthis tax. The House, in giving these overall powers,\r\n\r\nis  in fact not giving power for application of this\r\n\r\ntax  to  individual articles. It is  retaining  that\r\n\r\npower  and can exercise it when the Government comes\r\n\r\nbefore  the House seeking confirmation of its desire\r\n\r\nto tax any particular type of object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to learn that this Bill will go\r\n\r\nbefore a Select Committee. It is a good measure  and\r\n\r\nit  should,  as soon as possible, be on our  statute\r\n\r\nbook. But it is a difficult measure, a measure  full\r\n\r\nof      acute     technical     subtleties,      and\r\n\r\nrepresentations - some of which seem  very  valid - have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  by  the Bar Committee with reference  to\r\n\r\nvarious aspects. I think that a Select Committee  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  appropriate to consider  each  and  every\r\n\r\nindividual  phrase in the Bill, and  I  welcome  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion made by the Financial Secretary that this\r\n\r\nBill will, in fact, if it passes its Second Reading,\r\n\r\nbe submitted to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only one other remark to make on this\r\n\r\nmeasure,  Sir. I  welcome  the  statement  of   the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary that local industry will receive\r\n\r\ndirect  encouragement by the exemption, in part,  of\r\n\r\nthose   taxable  luxury  goods  which  are  produced\r\n\r\nlocally.  I would like to go further. Our industrial-set up is in an extremely poor condition and I would\r\n\r\nlike a large measure of assistance where possible to\r\n\r\nbe given to it, and in this instance it is possible.\r\n\r\nI  would like to see all luxury products, which  are\r\n\r\nsubject  to  this  tax, exempted  from  taxation  if\r\n\r\nproduced  locally.  I  also welcome  the  indication\r\n\r\ngiven by the Financial Secretary that products which\r\n\r\nare even partially produced in this colony, that is,\r\n\r\nin  respect of which part of the cost is incurred in\r\n\r\nthis   colony,  will  be  considered   for   partial\r\n\r\nexemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a good measure, a necessary measure,\r\n\r\na  well-thought out measure, and I say with  respect\r\n\r\nto  the  Member for Telok Ayer that I really do  not\r\n\r\nsee  how it can affect our entrepot trade. The basis\r\n\r\nof our entrepot trade is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproduce  from the East and the essentials  from  the\r\n\r\nWest in which we deal. Luxury goods as such form but\r\n\r\na  very  small proportion of our trade and  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  promised special arrangements for the entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade in these luxury goods so that it would not  in\r\n\r\nany way be impeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.42 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my\r\n\r\nobjections  to  this Bill are three-fold.  Firstly,\r\n\r\nany tax measure which endangers the free port status\r\n\r\nand the entrepot trade of Singapore is a bad measure\r\n\r\nand I am not convinced by the assurances of the hon.\r\n\r\nGentlemen  opposite  that this will  not  have  this\r\n\r\neffect. Secondly, the tax on certain luxuries, while\r\n\r\nintending to tax the rich, may, by a chain reaction,\r\n\r\nresult  in raising the cost of living for  the  poor\r\n\r\nman  as well. Thirdly, such a tax reduces the buying\r\n\r\nand selling of goods and the contraction in trade in\r\n\r\nan  island  which  lives or dies  by  trade  can  be\r\n\r\nsuicidal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that of all the definitions or\r\n\r\ninterpretations  which are made under  clause  3  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  there  is  no definition  of  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant term of all, the term \"luxury\". This makes\r\n\r\nus  extremely suspicious of Government's intentions.\r\n\r\nOnly  yesterday  I pointed out that  small  cars  in\r\n\r\ncertain  circumstances  are  necessities.   As   the\r\n\r\npressure  of  population increases, people  have  to\r\n\r\nlive  further  from their offices and  from  schools\r\n\r\nwhile  the  public transport system lags  inevitably\r\n\r\nfurther   and   further  behind  this   development.\r\n\r\nTherefore   it  is  essential  that  the   Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  should  give us a list  of  the  articles\r\n\r\nwhich  he has in mind to tax and a list beyond which\r\n\r\nhe  will in no circumstances go. Who knows otherwise\r\n\r\nwhether textiles and clothing will not be counted as\r\n\r\nluxuries  in  time  to come? In his  speech  on  the\r\n\r\nSecond   Reading  of  the  Appropriation  Bill   the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary stated as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Even if the imposition of luxury taxes were to\r\n\r\nlimit  consumption  of luxury  goods,  I  should  be\r\n\r\nperfectly  happy  since  it  would  mean  that   the\r\n\r\npopulation saved more and had more to invest in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment loans...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is a dangerously over-simplified argument and I\r\n\r\nam inclined to think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the savings would go, according to taste, into\r\n\r\ncompany  shares, gold and jewellery or into  lottery\r\n\r\ntickets.  It  is as dangerous as the other  argument\r\n\r\nthat  if you tax luxuries, you are necessarily  only\r\n\r\ntaxing  the  rich, an error into which the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Commerce and Industry fell yesterday. Very often\r\n\r\nyou will find that from such taxation it is the poor\r\n\r\nman  who  in  the end is to suffer. Let me  give  an\r\n\r\nexample.  The Financial Secretary has  given,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave said, no indication what the Government regards\r\n\r\nas  luxuries,  but  a  little  intelligent  guessing\r\n\r\nsuggests  that  refrigerators  and  air-conditioning\r\n\r\nsets might be on a short list of possibilities. Now,\r\n\r\nraising  the  price on these articles will  restrict\r\n\r\nsales  and, as a result of this, the consumption  of\r\n\r\nelectricity will drop; and it will drop  during  the\r\n\r\n20  hours outside the peak period from 6 to 10 p.m.,\r\n\r\nor,  precisely,  during those 20 hours  when  it  is\r\n\r\nessential  to sell as much electricity as  possible.\r\n\r\nLet it not be forgotten that it is the purchasers of\r\n\r\nrefrigerators  and air-conditioning sets  who  spend\r\n\r\nmore  on  electricity, and are therefore helping  to\r\n\r\nkeep down the price per unit of consumption. To make\r\n\r\na   complete  generalisation -  abolish  all   luxury\r\n\r\nelectrical  appliances and the price  the  poor  man\r\n\r\npays  for  his electric light will go up.  Encourage\r\n\r\nthe sale of these appliances by enabling more people\r\n\r\nto  buy them and to use electricity, and it will  be\r\n\r\npossible  to  lower the unit rate for  lighting  and\r\n\r\nlower the cost of living for the working man. May  I\r\n\r\nquote  a  sentence  from  the  1955  Report  of  the\r\n\r\nElectricity Department of the City Council:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As usual, emphasis must he placed upon the fact\r\n\r\nthat  only  by increased revenue from  the  sale  of\r\n\r\nelectrical   energy   can  this  Department   safely\r\n\r\nextinguish the various loans to which we  have  been\r\n\r\ncommitted  through  the  necessary  construction  of\r\n\r\nPasir Panjang Power Station.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I give this example as a warning to\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  study  very  carefully  what   chain\r\n\r\nreaction can be set up by an ill-considered tax.  It\r\n\r\nis  part and parcel of what I already said yesterday\r\n\r\nregarding  the  dangers of the inflationary  spiral.\r\n\r\nThe luxury tax, while on the face of it means taxing\r\n\r\nthe  rich without affecting the poor, can upset  the\r\n\r\neconomy  of the country to its foundations.  It  can\r\n\r\nraise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  cost  and  lower the standard of living,  which\r\n\r\nwould  be  fatal.  Just  when  the  wage-earner  has\r\n\r\nobtained  better living conditions to  which  he  is\r\n\r\nentitled  and  brings  within his  reach  the  extra\r\n\r\ncomforts  of  life,  it  appears  that  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment will put a tax on them to take  them  out\r\n\r\nof  his  reach.  It  reminds  me  of  the  story  of\r\n\r\nSisyphus, the Greek legendary king who was condemned\r\n\r\nin  Hades  to  roll a stone up to  the  top  of  the\r\n\r\nmountain,  and  when he laboured to  the  peak,  the\r\n\r\nstone rolled down again and he had to start all over\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seems to me to be the thin end of a\r\n\r\nwedge. Once it is approved in principle on the basis\r\n\r\nof  certain  types  of luxury  goods,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nknowing  what  will  come within the  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"luxuries\" in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.48 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am rather surprised\r\n\r\nthat   a  Party  which  claims  to  have  the   word\r\n\r\n\"Socialist\" as part of its name would be opposed  to\r\n\r\na  measure which any socialist-thinking person would\r\n\r\nwelcome,  a  measure  that is  intended  to  extract\r\n\r\npainlessly - I  can  say  it  because   it   is   slow\r\n\r\nextraction - a  little  bit  of  money - not  very  much\r\n\r\nbecause   the   burden  does   not   fall   on   one\r\n\r\nindividual - to  pay  for the social  services  to  be\r\n\r\nprovided for the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main argument, Sir, that has been advocated\r\n\r\nagainst this Bill has been one of departure from our\r\n\r\nfree  trade policy. Sir, I have emphasised  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse in the past this obsession with the free trade\r\n\r\npolicy  of  Singapore can be carried too  far.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  is no doubt that we survive on trade, and  it\r\n\r\nis  the duty of every government that is in power in\r\n\r\nthis  country to see that nothing is done that  will\r\n\r\nhamper  or discourage our entrepot trade. But,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  is a limit to which this principle should  be\r\n\r\ncarried,  and I say that with some people this  free\r\n\r\ntrade  principle  has become an obsession.  Economic\r\n\r\nconditions have changed and are changing every  day.\r\n\r\nWe  are  not in the position as we were before.  The\r\n\r\nworld   has  changed.  Asia  has  changed.  Economic\r\n\r\npolicies have changed. Politics have come into the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npicture now. In order to survive, therefore, we must\r\n\r\nsee  that we shape our policy in accordance with the\r\n\r\ntimes.  It  is  all very well to  say  that  we  are\r\n\r\nkilling  the free trade principle. We are not  doing\r\n\r\nthat.  In  fact,  we  want to preserve  as  much  as\r\n\r\npossible our entrepot trade and to expand it as much\r\n\r\nas  possible;  but it is dangerous to generalise  on\r\n\r\nit.  We must know in which sphere our entrepot trade\r\n\r\nlies  and what we can do outside this sphere without\r\n\r\nharming our entrepot trade. We should be free to  do\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Telok Ayer said that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  not  claim  to  represent  trading\r\n\r\ninterests.  Sir,  that  is  in  keeping   with   the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of democracy that representation  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse  of the people should be on a democratic basis\r\n\r\nand  that there should be no reserved seats for  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  any  particular  interests.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the hon. Member has many times remarked  that\r\n\r\nthis  Government is not fully elected and that there\r\n\r\nare  four nominated Members in this House and so  on\r\n\r\nand  so  forth. Therefore, Sir, I do not see how  he\r\n\r\ncan  be moan the fact that trade is not represented.\r\n\r\nBut  I  can say this, Sir: that although I have  not\r\n\r\nhad  the  vast  amount of experience that  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  has  in  trading spheres - I  am  younger  and\r\n\r\nobviously,  therefore,  I have  not  had  that  much\r\n\r\nexperience as he has - I can claim that I do have some\r\n\r\nexperience  of trade and entrepot trade and  I  will\r\n\r\nnot  do anything that is going to harm our trade.  I\r\n\r\nthink  Members  on the Opposition side  should  rest\r\n\r\nassured on that point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One remark that the Member for Telok Ayer made, I\r\n\r\nthink,  calls for some consideration,  and  that  is\r\n\r\nthat  a future government might mishandle this power\r\n\r\nwhich  we  are  seeking now. That is  a  possibility\r\n\r\nwhich  we have to think over very carefully.  But  I\r\n\r\nmay  answer  that  point by  saying  that  a  future\r\n\r\ngovernment,  even  though  it  has  not   got   this\r\n\r\nparticular  power, can always ask for and  get  this\r\n\r\npower  in a future House of the people. So there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  to prevent any government bringing  in  any\r\n\r\nmeasure which it likes provided it has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  majority,  and therefore whether or not  we  give\r\n\r\nthis power to posterity is immaterial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin raised the point of what\r\n\r\nare luxury goods and why we have not defined \"luxury\r\n\r\ngoods\".  Sir, it is a matter of opinion as  to  what\r\n\r\nare luxury goods. It is a matter of the standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  of  the  people.  It  is  a  matter  of  the\r\n\r\nenvironment and the upbringing and the residence  of\r\n\r\nthe  people. To us, what appears to be a luxury  may\r\n\r\nbe  a necessity to people who have a better standard\r\n\r\nof  living,  for instance, to people in  the  United\r\n\r\nStates. Yet to us what appears to be a necessity may\r\n\r\nbe  a luxury to people living in Africa who probably\r\n\r\nmay not have seen it at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanglin has also stated that\r\n\r\nthere  may  be  a  chain reaction which  may  affect\r\n\r\nelectrical consumption if a luxury tax is imposed on\r\n\r\ncertain electrical appliances. That is a far-fetched\r\n\r\nargument. There is always a chain reaction ending up\r\n\r\nsomewhere or other if you do anything in this world.\r\n\r\nSomething  is going to be affected by it.  So  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that  whether  this or  any  future  Socialist\r\n\r\ngovernment  brings in a measure for  raising  income\r\n\r\ntax on the higher limits of income, say, from 40 per\r\n\r\ncent  to  50  per  cent or even 60  per  cent,  that\r\n\r\nparticular  hon.  Member is going to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  chain  reaction  will  be  to  kill\r\n\r\nincentive,  and  therefore the activity  of  capital\r\n\r\nwill  be  dampened, and the man with money will  sit\r\n\r\ntight  and  not invest his money, and therefore  the\r\n\r\nlabourer will not be able to get a job and so on and\r\n\r\nso forth. That argument can be carried to any limit.\r\n\r\nThen,   Sir,  the  Member  for  Tanglin  said   that\r\n\r\nelectrical consumption may be reduced as a result of\r\n\r\nthis  luxury tax. And yet what do we hear today?  We\r\n\r\nhear that the City Council is going to spend another\r\n\r\n$65  million on extensions or on the building  of  a\r\n\r\nnew power-station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the crux of the matter is: what items\r\n\r\nare  going  to be included in the Luxury  Tax  Bill.\r\n\r\nThat  is  where hon. Members can debate bitterly  if\r\n\r\nthey feel that any item which the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  puts in the Schedule to this Bill  later\r\n\r\non  is not appropriate to be included there. But  to\r\n\r\ndenounce  the  general  principle  of  this  measure\r\n\r\nbecause  they do not know what item is going  to  be\r\n\r\nincluded  at  this stage is wrong.  I  commend  this\r\n\r\nBill,  Sir,  to hon. Members on both  sides  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.55 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin   spite   of  the  assurances  by  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary, the Member for Cairnhill and the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Commerce and Industry, I am not convinced  that\r\n\r\nthis Bill will not affect the status of Singapore as\r\n\r\na free port. We all agree that we live by trade, and\r\n\r\nnow that our entrepot trade is diminishing in volume\r\n\r\ndue  to the producing countries exporting direct  to\r\n\r\nEurope  and  America, and the Minister for  Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry  has spoken about his  fears  for  the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  our  industry in Singapore,  we  must\r\n\r\nthink twice before we do anything that may hurt  our\r\n\r\ntrade. The Minister for Commerce and Industry  seems\r\n\r\nto  get  hot and bothered and has turned this debate\r\n\r\ninto a political issue, but we on our side want  to\r\n\r\nput  before  the  House the views  of  the  traders,\r\n\r\nparticularly the small traders who do  most  of  the\r\n\r\nentrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has left the items intended to be taxed.\r\n\r\nIf  it  is confined to goods which are real luxuries\r\n\r\nsuch as refrigerators and air-conditioning sets, the\r\n\r\ntax  it  will bring in will not be worth the expense\r\n\r\nof  setting  up a department to collect it  and  the\r\n\r\nexpense and trouble it will cost the wholesaler.  If\r\n\r\nit  is intended to apply to many more items, then it\r\n\r\ncannot  be a luxury tax and the fears of the  public\r\n\r\nthat  the list of taxable goods will be the same  as\r\n\r\nthat  of  the Federation will be justified, and  the\r\n\r\npoor  man will suffer as much as those who can  best\r\n\r\nbear  the  burden and upon whom it is intended  that\r\n\r\nthis  tax  should fall. This tax will hit the  small\r\n\r\ntraders  most.  Their business lies in  sending  out\r\n\r\nvarious  kinds of goods to the small islands  around\r\n\r\nus  in  exchange for produce. They cannot  afford  a\r\n\r\nlarge staff to keep the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecords and fill the forms required by this  Bill.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a most complicated piece of machinery  and\r\n\r\neven the Financial Secretary has admitted it,  and\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Bar are greatly concerned  about\r\n\r\nsome of the anomalies already noticed. We are very\r\n\r\nglad  indeed,  therefore, that this Bill  will  be\r\n\r\nsent  to  Select Committee. Even many large  firms\r\n\r\nhave  expressed  their  opinion  to  me  that  the\r\n\r\nworking  out  of  this  tax  will  impose   almost\r\n\r\nimpossible conditions on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this luxury tax is to be imposed at all, it\r\n\r\nshould  be  at  the retail level and  not  at  the\r\n\r\nwholesale  level,  which  is  the  medium  of  our\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade. A measure like this,  imperilling\r\n\r\nSingapore as a free port, can only be justified in\r\n\r\nextremis,  that is, if there is no  other  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich  finance can be found by the Government  for\r\n\r\nthe  running  of Singapore, and I am  not  at  all\r\n\r\nsatisfied that we are in that position yet, unless\r\n\r\nwe choose to kill the goose that lays the eggs.  I\r\n\r\nhave advisedly left out the word \"golden\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the criticisms already expressed in\r\n\r\nthis  House yesterday, and I do not wish to repeat\r\n\r\nthem, we have many items of expenditure which  can\r\n\r\nbe  pruned and I shall attack these items  in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  stage;  but I do solemnly  repeat  that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, if passed, will do more harm than good\r\n\r\nto Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe speech on the Luxury Tax Bill delivered by the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Financial Secretary gave us  a  curious\r\n\r\nfeeling in the pit of our stomach! He was at great\r\n\r\npains  to emphasise that the people have the money\r\n\r\nto spend on things other than the bare necessities\r\n\r\nof life and they undoubtedly had, so he claimed it\r\n\r\nwas  therefore,  only  right that  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  have a fair share of it. This argument  is\r\n\r\nnot  only  unconvincing but dangerous.  In  simple\r\n\r\nQueen's English, it means that \"what is your's  is\r\n\r\nmine\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens of Singapore fully appreciate the\r\n\r\nfact  that  Government needs all  the  revenue  it\r\n\r\ncould  get,  but they do feel that  the  intricate\r\n\r\nmatter of luxury tax must be debated, talked about\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchallenged lest they would suffer the consequences\r\n\r\nof    the    Hon. the   Financial   Secretary's\r\n\r\nindiscretion.  In  the  words  of  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary, the Luxury tax demanded  and\r\n\r\nexpected is to be partly determined by a mere look\r\n\r\nat the shop windows rather than by a careful study\r\n\r\nof  the  \"earning  and  paying  abilities  of  the\r\n\r\npeople\". The income of the majority of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore ranges between $2,500 and $4,000 per\r\n\r\nannum,  and  I would draw the urgent attention  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  these wage-earners  are  at  all\r\n\r\ntimes  so  poor that they cannot afford  to  spend\r\n\r\nmoney on one thing without depriving themselves of\r\n\r\nsomething  else. It is not hard for Government  to\r\n\r\nunderstand also that the purchase of even  a  tiny\r\n\r\ngold  locket does add zest to a wage-earner's life\r\n\r\nand   that   the  possession  of  a  wrist   watch\r\n\r\nconstitutes a social distinction, being the  first\r\n\r\nstep  upward  in  the  economic  progress  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry. Our business houses are doing an enormous\r\n\r\nentrepot trade in Singapore with a wide variety of\r\n\r\nmerchandise and the result of a luxury tax will be\r\n\r\nto  destroy  our entrepot trade, thus killing  the\r\n\r\ngoose  that  lays the golden eggs,  if  Government\r\n\r\ninsists on collecting this tax at wholesale  level\r\n\r\nbased   on  wholesale  prices.  Let  us  be   more\r\n\r\nrealistic  and  look at some of the  major  snags.\r\n\r\nLocal  wholesale prices will undoubtedly rise  and\r\n\r\nthe   immediate  effect  is  to  drive  away   our\r\n\r\ncustomers  from  the  neighbouring  countries   to\r\n\r\nHongkong  or  elsewhere where  they  could  obtain\r\n\r\ntheir  requirements at very much  cheaper  prices.\r\n\r\nBusiness  in Singapore will eventually be  reduced\r\n\r\nto  a  \"retailer-to-consumer\" basis only  and  the\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade will virtually be at a standstill.\r\n\r\nIn  a country which thrives solely on its entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  and  where  a  negligible  portion  of  the\r\n\r\nimported  goods  are  actually  consumed  by   its\r\n\r\npeople,  the  proposed luxury tax  will  serve  no\r\n\r\nuseful  purpose  except  to  bring  chaos  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry. Singapore import houses will, as a result\r\n\r\nof the introduction of the luxury tax, arrange for\r\n\r\nshipments of their agency lines of goods direct to\r\n\r\nthe   buyers   outside  Singapore,  and   thus   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  portion of the trade will  bypass\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  due course, Government  will  have\r\n\r\nvery much less revenues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  taxes on profits and personal income.  Heavier\r\n\r\ntaxes  will eventually fall on the shoulders of  the\r\n\r\naverage   man-in-the-street,  which  must  ultimately\r\n\r\ncause  widespread  demands for higher  wages. I would\r\n\r\ndraw  the attention of the hon. Member of this House\r\n\r\nthat  another round of wage increases, unaccompanied\r\n\r\nby  corresponding increases in entrepot trade or the\r\n\r\nlocal  industries, is pound to seriously  upset  our\r\n\r\neconomy,  Thus crippling our prospects for  merdeka.\r\n\r\nThis Luxury Tax Bill is a hara kiri or suicide Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.05 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as\r\n\r\na  believer  in  socialism, I rise  to  support  the\r\n\r\nprinciples of this Bill, but at the same time I wish\r\n\r\nto  remind  hon. Members on both sides of the  house\r\n\r\nthat  there  are at least two points which  we  must\r\n\r\nbear  in  mind. We have been hearing all  this  time\r\n\r\nabout  the  argument on the entrepot trade  and  the\r\n\r\nfree  port  status of this island. I wonder  whether\r\n\r\nthe  Members of this House will admit that it  is  a\r\n\r\nfact  that  experience  has shown  that  Singapore's\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade  and its status as a  free  port  is\r\n\r\nquickly  passing.  We  expect  to  produce  our  own\r\n\r\nproducts   and  export  them  to  other   countries,\r\n\r\nincluding,  of  course,  our  brother  country,  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya. But whether  this  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  will  continue  is  a  question  that  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers will have to answer for themselves.  For  my\r\n\r\npart, I believe it will not continue. Sir, I find it\r\n\r\nrather  hard to understand why, especially  when  we\r\n\r\nare  faced  with difficulties of expansion  and  the\r\n\r\nencouragement   of   our   local   industries,   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya should impose so many  tariffs\r\n\r\nupon  our  products. Further, we now have Indonesia,\r\n\r\nThailand  and Burma, which for many years have  been\r\n\r\nour chief customers, closing their doors upon us one\r\n\r\nby  one. Therefore, we should not rely too much  and\r\n\r\nalways on our entrepot trade or the free port status\r\n\r\nof Singapore, especially since all political Parties\r\n\r\nin  this House now believe in socialism. It is  high\r\n\r\ntime  for us to tell the people the truth,  that  we\r\n\r\nmust now work hard, spend less and try to save more.\r\n\r\nTherefore this Bill is, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink,  most timely. The people of Singapore  should\r\n\r\nrealise  the critical situation that lies ahead  and\r\n\r\nwork hard and save more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I wish to know is what items\r\n\r\nwill be classified as luxury goods. The question  of\r\n\r\nsmall cars was argued yesterday and today. Sir, last\r\n\r\nnight  I  happened to attend a high society marriage\r\n\r\ndinner  party. A friend of mine was telling me  that\r\n\r\nhis  wife had been grumbling, that she loved the new\r\n\r\nmodel  of the Singer sports car very much, and  that\r\n\r\nshe insisted on her husband booking one immediately.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  understand the Singer sports car is in  the\r\n\r\ncategory  of a small saloon car. I know this  family\r\n\r\nvery  well. The husband has a big Custom-build  Ford\r\n\r\ncar  which sends him to and from office and his wife\r\n\r\nhas a small Fiat car which she uses for shopping and\r\n\r\nmarketing.  And  now this beautiful and  lucky  lady\r\n\r\ninsists that they must have another car, a beautiful\r\n\r\nSinger sports car, for night driving!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, I rise to support the principles of this\r\n\r\nBill  and  welcome  the statement of  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  that  it  will  be  sent  to   a   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. I wish to point out that not only must  a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  be  appointed  to  consider  this\r\n\r\nLuxury  Tax Bill but it must go to work on  it  very\r\n\r\nquickly. It should not let the deliberations drag on\r\n\r\nso  that  the  operation of  this  measure  will  be\r\n\r\ndelayed.  The  present  caretaker  Government,  even\r\n\r\nthough  it  will remain in office for the  next  few\r\n\r\nmonths only, should pass this measure quickly. Since\r\n\r\nall  political Parties believe in socialism, let  us\r\n\r\nbe  honest and admit that a tax on luxury  goods  is\r\n\r\nvery essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J.

In fact, when they talk about the  tax  on\r\n\r\nluxury  goods, the people of Singapore  will  think\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  not going to be  affected  by  it.\r\n\r\nHowever,  because there is no naming  of  goods  in\r\n\r\nthe  Schedule  to  the Bill, nobody  knows  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  type of goods will come under the definitions\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill. The Hon. the Minister for  Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry said that it is a matter of  opinion,\r\n\r\nand,  of  course, that matter of opinion  will  lie\r\n\r\nwith  the  Comptroller of Customs, or  probably  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  decided after some of the  Ministers  get\r\n\r\ntogether  and  say, \"We will define this  and  that\r\n\r\nand the other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Clause 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> All right, we have clause 3,\r\n\r\nbut  even  with  this  clause, it  is  possible  the\r\n\r\nGovernment may change its mind every now  and  then.\r\n\r\nToday it says it is having a deficit of $34 million.\r\n\r\nNext year it will put in the Estimates a deficit  of\r\n\r\n$50  million and then, in order to raise that money,\r\n\r\nit  says  it must add on to the Schedule  of  luxury\r\n\r\ngoods  other items. That is why, Sir, when  we  talk\r\n\r\nabout luxury goods, it is important to know where we\r\n\r\nwill  stop. Yesterday I said that if you confine  it\r\n\r\nto  such  items as air-conditioning sets and radios,\r\n\r\nthat  seems to be quite acceptable to the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  at  large. As a matter of fact,  when  we\r\n\r\ntalk  about  radios, there are big  ones  and  small\r\n\r\nones.  There are radios that are purchased by people\r\n\r\nwho  have plenty of money to spare and to throw away\r\n\r\ntoo;  but  there  are  also small  radios  that  are\r\n\r\nusually purchased by the ordinary wage-earners.

What is an  ordinary  wage-earner, Sir? Can he define him in terms of dollars?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, Sir. By \"ordinary wage-earner\", I must exclude, first and foremost, all\r\n\r\nMinisters because, although they draw salaries, they\r\n\r\ndraw  very high salaries, and, of course, I  exclude\r\n\r\nmanagerial   staff;  but  I  include  the   ordinary\r\n\r\nclerical  staffs  working in most  firms,  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  the government offices,  whose  salary\r\n\r\nrange  will be somewhere between $150 and  $400  per\r\n\r\nmonth. People drawing these salaries will be, in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  ordinary wage-earners. I also include,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, workmen who earn about $4 to $5 a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was talking just now about jewellery, and\r\n\r\nmention  of  it  brings to mind  diamonds  and  very\r\n\r\nexpensive  brooches and so on - that I think everybody\r\n\r\nwill agree - but when you come down to other items  of\r\n\r\njewellery which must necessarily be included if  the\r\n\r\nword \"jewellery\" is added to the Schedule, then  you\r\n\r\nwill  have  such  things as  small  gold  rings  and\r\n\r\nbangles.  Sir,  the Minister for Communications  and\r\n\r\nWorks  said that people should not keep their  money\r\n\r\nin gold but should put their money to better use - put\r\n\r\nit  into circulation, invest in government loans.  I\r\n\r\nput it to you, Sir, that we must not always look  at\r\n\r\na problem from our own point of view, but we must be\r\n\r\nable to look at it from the point of view of the man\r\n\r\nin the street. Of course, to us it would be silly to\r\n\r\nlock  up $50 in the form of a gold bangle or a  gold\r\n\r\nring; but to these people, if they put this money in\r\n\r\nthe  Post  Office Savings Bank and if they  want  to\r\n\r\nmake  use of it at one time or other, they will find\r\n\r\nthat  they have to take a bit of time and some form-\r\n\r\nfilling before they can get the money back, and they\r\n\r\ndo  not  like  this.  It is a  difficulty  that  any\r\n\r\nilliterate will try to avoid. You can say that  they\r\n\r\nshould,  of course, keep it in a bank, but  we  know\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbankers  do not work free for people with less  than\r\n\r\n$500 in the bank. The banks impose a surcharge of, I\r\n\r\nthink,  $5  per half-year and so these  people  find\r\n\r\nthat   their   money,  instead  of  increasing,   is\r\n\r\ndwindling  on  account of having to  pay  a  tax  on\r\n\r\ncheques  and again they have to contend  with  other\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  Therefore, Sir, the small  man  saves\r\n\r\nhis  money and invests it in gold - it is his  savings\r\n\r\nbank - and if he ever wants money, he just goes to the\r\n\r\npawnshop  and  pawns it. So if the item  \"jewellery\"\r\n\r\nshould come within the Schedule, it will affect  the\r\n\r\npoor workers indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us look at the problem from another\r\n\r\nangle.  Today it is the intention of every political\r\n\r\nParty to raise the standard of living of the average\r\n\r\nman  in  Singapore.  It is now accepted,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nordinary   things  such  as  small   radios,   small\r\n\r\nrefrigerators  and some transport facilities  should\r\n\r\nbecome  essential to everybody, and if we  can  give\r\n\r\nthe  workers  all these things, we will  be  raising\r\n\r\ntheir standard of living. This Bill, in effect, Sir,\r\n\r\nwould  be  to  try  and exclude  these  people  from\r\n\r\ngetting what we want them to get in order to improve\r\n\r\ntheir standard of living. In this connection, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould say that there are many clerks and workers who\r\n\r\nstrive very bravely to improve their condition. They\r\n\r\nstrive  to  get a house. They strive to get  a  car.\r\n\r\nThey  strive to get a radio. They strive  to  get  a\r\n\r\nrefrigerator.  I  say \"strive\", Sir,  because  these\r\n\r\npeople  cannot  really afford to  pay  outright  for\r\n\r\nthese items. So what do they do? They go along to  a\r\n\r\ncompany  and  ask for a loan and they  pay  back  in\r\n\r\ninstallments - I say \"installments\" - so that even  such\r\n\r\ngoods cannot be purchased on the basis of what  they\r\n\r\ncan pay. They have to save and stint in order to buy\r\n\r\nthem,  and probably out of money loaned to  them  at\r\n\r\ninterest. If we are to put more difficulties in  the\r\n\r\nway  of  people in this category, Sir, then  we  are\r\n\r\nputting difficulties in the way of those who  strive\r\n\r\nto  raise their own standard of living, which I hope\r\n\r\nis our aim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now come to the principle of the Bill.\r\n\r\nMy  friends and colleagues have said that  Singapore\r\n\r\nis a free port and up to today we have enjoyed that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatus.  In fact, we have been patting ourselves  on\r\n\r\nthe  back  all this time, saying that the Federation\r\n\r\nis putting a tax on cloth, a tax on cosmetics, a tax\r\n\r\non  this and that, and we are still free from it. If\r\n\r\nthis  Bill is passed by the present Government, then\r\n\r\nI  think the people will know that the loss of  such\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  the  loss of  the  ability  to  pat\r\n\r\nthemselves  on  the back again is the  work  of  the\r\n\r\npresent Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government say that we must try and extract\r\n\r\nmoney  painlessly for our social services. That  was\r\n\r\nsaid  by  the  Hon. the Minister for  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry.  With all that I have described before,  I\r\n\r\nsay  that the largest amount of money will be coming\r\n\r\nfrom the people who are working, and I maintain that\r\n\r\nstand,  Sir. A rich man will buy one radio.  A  poor\r\n\r\nman  will buy one radio. There may be 19,000  people\r\n\r\nwho pay income tax and could be regarded as well-to-do,  but  the  remainder of  the  1,200,000  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation, Sir, who do not pay income tax - and many\r\n\r\nof  them  come under the category of people who  are\r\n\r\nnot  well-to-do - strive to buy radios.  Look  up  the\r\n\r\nradio  licences and if you can tell me that most  of\r\n\r\nthose  people  who buy radios are the  rich  people,\r\n\r\nthen  I  am ready to agree with the Government  that\r\n\r\nthe  tax on luxuries will be on the rich and not the\r\n\r\npoor.  In effect, Sir, this goes back to the Chinese\r\n\r\naxiom  that if you want wool, it must come from  the\r\n\r\nbody  of the sheep. If you want any social services,\r\n\r\nyou  must pay for them. If the people, according  to\r\n\r\nthe  aims  of  the Labour Front, are to  get  higher\r\n\r\nsocial services, then the payment for them must  not\r\n\r\ncome  from  the rich people. It must come  from  the\r\n\r\nworking  people.

We  were\r\n\r\nstrong in 1954. We were strong early in April  1955.\r\n\r\nOur  position has deteriorated only after April 1955\r\n\r\nand has not improved to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M.

In considering this  Bill,\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Commerce and Industry said that any\r\n\r\ngovernment can bring in any measure. If  we  do  not\r\n\r\nbring   in   the  Luxury  Tax  Bill,  then   another\r\n\r\ngovernment  can  bring it in. It  can  bring  it  in\r\n\r\nanytime  whatsoever. But I would like to point  out,\r\n\r\nSir, that we are living in a democratic country  and\r\n\r\nwhen we live in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  democratic  country, we must not  say  that  just\r\n\r\nbecause we are the Government, we hold the reins  of\r\n\r\ngovernment,  we go wherever we like, we  direct  the\r\n\r\ntraffic  as  we please, whether it is going  against\r\n\r\nanybody  at  all. In a democratic set-up,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  all sections of the population, even  the\r\n\r\nminority, must be considered. We must try to take in\r\n\r\nall views and see that every Bill that is passed  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  will  not affect  any  section  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  adversely. We say that this  Luxury  Tax\r\n\r\nBill  is  going  to  affect  many  sections  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation. Of course, the biggest section that will\r\n\r\nbe  affected will be the ones doing business, and  I\r\n\r\nmust  declare, Sir, that I am not a businessman and.\r\n\r\nI am not speaking from a businessman's point of view\r\n\r\nbut from the average wage-earner's point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, we have a very incomplete\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of how electricity is being  produced\r\n\r\nand  how  it is consumed. I happen to know a  little\r\n\r\nbit  about  electricity. I  have  visited  a  power-station,  so  I am in a position to be able  to  say\r\n\r\nwith  some  certainty  how it works.  In  the  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang power-station it would be economical if  the\r\n\r\nload  were to be kept at a constant level,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe burning of fuel and the gyrations of its various\r\n\r\nmachines would carry on at about the same rate.  The\r\n\r\namount  of energy consumed is not a criterion,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbut if we have a good average -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Singapore is a trading centre and\r\n\r\nwhenever  people are being made to do more work,  we\r\n\r\nfind  that  invariably  they  avoid  it.  There  are\r\n\r\nbusiness  houses that do import and export  business\r\n\r\non an agency basis, and such being the case, Sir, it\r\n\r\nwill mean that if we have a luxury tax and the goods\r\n\r\ncannot be bonded in the Harbour Board or there is no\r\n\r\ngovernment  godown to bond them, or  there  is  any\r\n\r\ndifficulty  about anything, they will try  to  avoid\r\n\r\nmaking  things difficult for themselves. So it  will\r\n\r\nmean  direct  shipment  of  goods  to  the  consumer\r\n\r\ncountries,  or  transhipment,  and  this  will  make\r\n\r\nSingapore a less important city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.35 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

After this rather lengthy\r\n\r\ndebate,  Sir,  two  points  of  criticism   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment measure emerged from the speeches made by\r\n\r\nthe   Opposition.  The  first  point  is  that   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of this Bill will definitely  harm  the\r\n\r\nentrepot trade. The other point is that the tax will\r\n\r\nnot be a tax on luxury goods but on a wide range  of\r\n\r\ngoods which will affect the cost of living generally\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  and  affect  the  working   man   in\r\n\r\nparticular. Both these criticisms, Sir, are entirely\r\n\r\nbaseless. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot  say  more  than I have  already  said  about\r\n\r\nGovernment's desire not to harm the entrepot  trade,\r\n\r\nabout  Government's realisation that the  prosperity\r\n\r\nof  Singapore depends upon the entrepot  trade,  and\r\n\r\nabout Government's conviction that nothing should be\r\n\r\ndone to harm that trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other point, I can only give an\r\n\r\nassurance that the articles chosen to be subject  to\r\n\r\nthis  tax will be chosen with great care. They  will\r\n\r\nbe  chosen so that they will have the minimum effect\r\n\r\nupon the entrepot trade of Singapore and the cost of\r\n\r\nliving in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I should say that, whatever articles\r\n\r\nare  chosen by Government for the imposition of this\r\n\r\ntax,  the  Assembly will, within seven days  of  the\r\n\r\norder  being  published,  have  the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\ncriticise  or  express any views it  wishes  on  the\r\n\r\narticles which have been chosen.

In Singapore up\r\n\r\nto the present moment, Sir, there is no Port Welfare\r\n\r\nCommittee  as  such  and  the  Singapore  Mercantile\r\n\r\nMarine  Fund  Committee, which has been  established\r\n\r\nunder  the  Merchant  Shipping Ordinance,  has  been\r\n\r\ntrying  to  perform that function as best it  could.\r\n\r\nThere are, Sir, about 8,000 inhabitants of Singapore\r\n\r\nwho work on board ships and it was therefore clearly\r\n\r\ndesirable  that  a body be constituted  which  would\r\n\r\nlook  after  the  welfare of seamen  in  a  positive\r\n\r\nmanner  and on which the seamen themselves would  be\r\n\r\nrepresented.  My predecessor, Sir,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill,   therefore,  having   regard   to   this\r\n\r\ndesirability and also the resolution passed  at  the\r\n\r\nNuwara  Eliya  Conference, appointed a committee  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1955  to consider the setting  up  of  an\r\n\r\norganisation for port welfare work in Singapore, and\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  that is now before hon. Members  embodies\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations  made in  the  Report  of  that\r\n\r\nCommittee.  I  wish  to convey  my  thanks  to  that\r\n\r\nCommittee, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now proposed that this Board should\r\n\r\nadminister the Singapore Mercantile Marine Fund, but\r\n\r\nthe   Government  has  also  seen  to  it  that  the\r\n\r\nproposals  would not interfere with the considerable\r\n\r\nautonomy  of existing organisations which,  in  most\r\n\r\ncases, are supported by voluntary contributions. One\r\n\r\naspect,  however, Sir, which I wish to emphasise  in\r\n\r\nthis   legislation  is  that  the  Board  is   being\r\n\r\nempowered  to  assist  in  activities  directed   at\r\n\r\nproviding  training  facilities  for  seafarers   or\r\n\r\npersons  intending to become seafarers.  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthis will be welcomed by hon. Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the Singapore Mercantile Marine Fund\r\n\r\nCommittee  has up to a certain extent been  able  to\r\n\r\nperform  the function of co-ordinating the activities\r\n\r\nof various bodies engaged in welfare work, yet there\r\n\r\nare  certain  shortcomings which it  is  desired  to\r\n\r\nremedy   through   this  Bill.   In   brief,   these\r\n\r\nshortcomings  are  that the title of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nMercantile  Marine Fund Committee  does  not  convey\r\n\r\nmuch  to the ordinary seafarer and, as such,  it  is\r\n\r\nsomething which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis remote to him. The constitution of the Mercantile\r\n\r\nMarine   Fund   Committee  does  not   provide   for\r\n\r\nrepresentation  of seafarers whose welfare  was  the\r\n\r\nconcern  of the Committee. This is a glaring  defect\r\n\r\nand  not  in  accordance with democratic principles.\r\n\r\nAlso  the Singapore Mercantile Marine Fund Committee\r\n\r\nwould  not  of its own accord go out of its  way  to\r\n\r\ncover  the  exploration of new fields of  seafarers'\r\n\r\nwelfare  and the creation of means to meet such  new\r\n\r\nrequirements.  Thus  this  Committee  performs   its\r\n\r\nfunctions  in  a  negative way. The  proposed  Board\r\n\r\nwould  be  able to perform its functions in  a  more\r\n\r\npositive manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a relatively simple Bill and\r\n\r\ntherefore  it  does not call for comment  clause  by\r\n\r\nclause;  but  I would like to draw the attention  of\r\n\r\nhon. Members particularly to two clauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3, the title of \"the Seafarers' Welfare\r\n\r\nBoard\"  is an apt one in that it establishes  beyond\r\n\r\ndoubt that the work of the Board will be confined to\r\n\r\nseafarers and not to port workers generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 (1) provides for the membership of the\r\n\r\nBoard. It provides for four Government members, four\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  shipowners'  associations,  and\r\n\r\nfour  seafarers' representatives. It  also  provides\r\n\r\nfor  four  members  of religious  organisations,  as\r\n\r\nopposed  to  one in the present Singapore Mercantile\r\n\r\nMarine Fund Committee, and it is hoped that by  this\r\n\r\nprovision  various religious groups may be  able  to\r\n\r\nappoint  representatives on the Board, so  that  the\r\n\r\nreligious  requirements of seafarers may be  catered\r\n\r\nfor   more   efficiently.  An   unofficial   ladies'\r\n\r\norganisation   called   the   Singapore    Seafarers\r\n\r\nEntertainment   Committee  has  up   to   now   been\r\n\r\nperforming valuable work among seafarers, and it  is\r\n\r\nfelt  that  it would be advantageous to include  two\r\n\r\nladies with experience of this type of welfare  work\r\n\r\namongst  the  members  of the Board,  and  therefore\r\n\r\nthere  is provision for the inclusion of two  ladies\r\n\r\nto be members of this Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure the House will welcome this Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  sets up the proper machinery for the  welfare\r\n\r\nof seafarers in Singapore.

May I suggest to the Minister that it\r\n\r\nmight  be  reasonable that, of  those  four  persons\r\n\r\nrepresenting seafarers, two should be selected  from\r\n\r\nthe master/ officer group and two from the seaman or\r\n\r\napprentice  group,  so  that all  interests  can  be\r\n\r\nrepresented on the Board?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.45 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am  happy to support this measure which seeks  to\r\n\r\nco-ordinate  the somewhat sectional approach  to  the\r\n\r\nwelfare   of  seafarers  in  the  past.   There   is\r\n\r\nconsiderable room, Sir, for assisting our  seafarers\r\n\r\nand  I  am particularly happy to note clause  6  (a) \r\n\r\n(ii)   which  gives the Board powers to  provide  for\r\n\r\ntraining  facilities  for those  who  desire  to  be\r\n\r\nseafarers and for seafarers themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also happy to note the provision for four\r\n\r\npersons representing seafarers on this Board.

The  City  and\r\n\r\nIsland  Council elections should have been  held  in\r\n\r\nabout June 1955. The present Government scrapped the\r\n\r\nlocal  government scheme recommended by  the  Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand they are taking more than two years to put a new\r\n\r\nscheme into operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As no City Council elections have been held since\r\n\r\nDecember  1953 - or three years ago - it means that  the\r\n\r\nlast  third  of elected City Councillors  will  have\r\n\r\ncompleted their term of office of three years  under\r\n\r\nthis  Ordinance at the end of this month,  and  that\r\n\r\nhenceforth they will join the other two-thirds in an\r\n\r\nextended  life. This therefore means that  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil   becomes  a  wholly  nominated  body   from\r\n\r\nDecember  this  year, and I am therefore  unable  to\r\n\r\nunderstand   the  amendment  which   the   Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister  is  putting forward as an afterthought  to\r\n\r\ndifferentiate  between those  members  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  nominated by the Governor  in  Council  and\r\n\r\nthose  members of the City Council who,  in  effect,\r\n\r\nhave  been  nominated by this Assembly, by extending\r\n\r\nthe  life  of the latter and not of the  former.  In\r\n\r\nview of the fact that there are some members of  the\r\n\r\nCity Council who were elected in the dim distant era\r\n\r\nof December 1951, whereas others have been nominated\r\n\r\nby  the  Governor in Council within the life of  the\r\n\r\npresent Government, there seems no justification for\r\n\r\nthis differentiation.

The Labour Front has approached\r\n\r\nthis  problem  with  considerable  thought  and   an\r\n\r\nanxious desire for justice for the people. We  would\r\n\r\nhave preferred so much more to have a clean slate, a\r\n\r\ncompletely clean slate, and an opportunity  for  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore to have representatives who,  in\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances of today and with the  experience\r\n\r\nwhich  they  have of the conduct and the  misconduct\r\n\r\nthat has taken place in the City Council, they would\r\n\r\nhave perhaps not chosen the same representatives and\r\n\r\nwould  choose  others more worthy of the  honour  of\r\n\r\nspeaking  on  behalf of their fellow  citizens.  But\r\n\r\nthis we cannot do and therefore the question is what\r\n\r\ncan we do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must have a City Council.

But,\r\n\r\nSir, though the technical aspect put forward by  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Tanglin   is   accurate   and   their\r\n\r\ncontinuation in office is, in fact, a nomination  by\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly, this Assembly is not nominating them\r\n\r\nas  individuals;  it  is  not  giving  the  seal  of\r\n\r\napproval  to  those persons who are elected  Members\r\n\r\nnow  in the City Council. It is saying no more  than\r\n\r\nthis - we  are in a quandary how to continue the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  since we cannot hold elections;  therefore,\r\n\r\nsince  those gentlemen have been approved by members\r\n\r\nof  the  public in the past and since they  want  to\r\n\r\ncontinue in office without resignation, by all means\r\n\r\ncontinue  for yet one more year, and then, pray  God\r\n\r\nwe will have a clean slate of it all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no such considerations, Sir, can apply to\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  been nominated under  pressure  of\r\n\r\npolitical influence in a totally different political\r\n\r\natmosphere   and  who  have,  in  the  main,   shown\r\n\r\nthemselves unworthy of the position which they  hold\r\n\r\nin the unpleasant,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblatant manoeuverings, utterly cynical of the welfare\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Sir, that the Labour Front will be charged\r\n\r\nwith nepotism.

It is not  with\r\n\r\npleasure,  Sir,  and it is due to  no  Machiavellian\r\n\r\ndesire  to dominate the City Council that the Labour\r\n\r\nFront has taken the decision in association with its\r\n\r\ncolleagues of the Alliance to say, \"No,  an  end  to\r\n\r\nthese  nominated Members.

Member  merely  indicated  that  there  is   a\r\n\r\nprivilege which does protect Members of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Thank you, Sir. I certainly\r\n\r\nthink  there  is a privilege protecting this  House.\r\n\r\nPrevious  to  this, Sir, whenever an  accusation  is\r\n\r\nthrown by Members of the Opposition, they are  asked\r\n\r\nto  give  facts  and  figures.  They  are  asked  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  their cases. I would  very  much  like\r\n\r\nsuch   accusations   to   be   substantiated,    and\r\n\r\nsubstantiated in the newspapers and not just in this\r\n\r\nHouse, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard that Members on the Government\r\n\r\nBenches are honest, very worthy, and they have shown\r\n\r\ntheir clean hands. I do not doubt for a moment  that\r\n\r\nthey are clean and good and worthy, but I think  the\r\n\r\nmore  important  thing is that  we  must  not  judge\r\n\r\nourselves. The judgment must be left to the  people.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, Sir, the City Councillors have done\r\n\r\nwhat  they  think  is in the best interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore. It is not for Members  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  to judge their conduct. It is  up  to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore to pass judgment on them, and  I\r\n\r\nsay  that  if  this House is really  keen  that  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore should pass judgment on the City\r\n\r\nCouncillors, then let there be fresh elections,  and\r\n\r\nfresh  elections at the earliest possible moment.  I\r\n\r\nam  for  it. If the Government will scrap this  Bill\r\n\r\nand  have elections next month, I will support their\r\n\r\nmove.  The only thing is that they cannot, and  they\r\n\r\ncannot do it, not because anybody is preventing them\r\n\r\nfrom doing it, but because they have delayed matters\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Do  not tell this House  that  you  are\r\n\r\nunhappy to allow this state of affairs to go on. You\r\n\r\nwant fresh elections. You want a clean\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nslate.

The Government have  not\r\n\r\ndone it. The fault lies with the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, when another hon.

In fact, they are  overdue.  We\r\n\r\nwant  the people to cast their verdict.

I\r\n\r\nhave  reluctantly  to  support  this  Bill.  I   am,\r\n\r\nhowever, happy that the Member for Serangoon and the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill and many other  hon.  Members\r\n\r\nagree  that it is high time for us to have a glimpse\r\n\r\ninto  this  \"dirty  water\". Sir, I  agree  with  the\r\n\r\nsentiments  of the Member for Serangoon that  it  is\r\n\r\nonly   the  people  of  Singapore  who  should  pass\r\n\r\njudgment on the efficiency and integrity of the City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  As far as I am concerned, judging  by  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  that  I have received from  the  general\r\n\r\npublic, it is, I think, high time for us to clean up\r\n\r\nthe City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at one City Council problem - the\r\n\r\nhawkers' problem. What have our City Fathers done to\r\n\r\nsettle this problem? My memory is rather weak,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbut  I  think  I  can remember one  City  Councillor\r\n\r\nproposing that hawkers should have to pay income\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntax! There is also another Councillor who said, long\r\n\r\nago,   that  hawkers  are  capitalists!  These   two\r\n\r\nexamples alone, I believe, will illustrate how  many\r\n\r\nof   those  sitting  on  the  City  Council   really\r\n\r\nunderstand the problems of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I support the abolition of these\r\n\r\nnominated City Councillors, I wonder whether  it  is\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention to nominate new members - \"new\r\n\r\nblood\"  is the expression used - who may turn out  to\r\n\r\nbe  \"yes\" men-one hon.

I wish the  Government\r\n\r\nwill   bear   in   mind,  when  they  nominate   new\r\n\r\nCouncillors, not to have any more \"yes\" men but true\r\n\r\ncivic leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

As hon. Members\r\n\r\nare aware, there have been no City Council elections\r\n\r\nsince  December  1953, and the life of  the  present\r\n\r\nCity  Council has been extended since that  year  by\r\n\r\nsimilar   Bills  as  the  present  one.  The   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Bill,  1956, and  the  Local  Government\r\n\r\nElections  Bill, 1956, Sir, are now  in  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  stage.  It  is  considered  that  elected\r\n\r\nCouncillors could continue to hold office as  it  is\r\n\r\npreferable that new City Council elections should be\r\n\r\nheld   under  the  provisions  of  the   new   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Elections Ordinance. In  any  case,  the\r\n\r\nprevious    City   Council   Elections    (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Bill  dispensed with the  necessity  of\r\n\r\nrevising the electoral register, and so they are out\r\n\r\nof date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard, however, to the appointed\r\n\r\nCouncillors,  some of whom have been holding  office\r\n\r\nas  far  back  as 1951 and all of whom  are  due  to\r\n\r\nretire  on  1st December, 1956, the reason  why  the\r\n\r\npresent  Bill  seeks to end their tenure  of  office\r\n\r\nwhile elected members continue for another year,  is\r\n\r\nto  enable  fresh  nominations to be  submitted  for\r\n\r\nconsideration.

The  effect of this change is illustrated  by\r\n\r\nthe following figures:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual with a chargeable income of $200)\r\n\r\nwill pay $10 in tax instead of $6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual with a chargeable income of $500\r\n\r\nwill pay $25 instead of $15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual with a chargeable income of $700\r\n\r\nwill pay $35 instead of $23.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual with a chargeable income of $1,000\r\n\r\nwill pay $50 instead of 35\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, individuals will pay $15 more than\r\n\r\nthey at present pay right up the scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  has been said that these increases are likely to\r\n\r\ncause  hardship.  This, Sir, I cannot  believe.  The\r\n\r\nmaximum increase in which these new rates result  is\r\n\r\n$15 and this is due in respect of chargeable incomes\r\n\r\nof  $1,000  or  over. An increase of this  order  is\r\n\r\nwithin the means of all taxpayers to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment to existing rates of tax is\r\n\r\nthe insertion of a new rate of 25 per cent which  is\r\n\r\napplicable to the $10,000 slab of chargeable  income\r\n\r\nimmediately above the $35,000 point. The next $5,000\r\n\r\nis chargeable at 30 per cent and the next succeeding\r\n\r\n$5,000  at 35 per cent. This takes us up to  $55,000\r\n\r\nworth  of  chargeable income above which  point  the\r\n\r\nrate  of tax will be 40 per cent. The effect of this\r\n\r\nincrease in tax on chargeable incomes in the  higher\r\n\r\nranges will be as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of single individuals:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a chargeable income of $50,000, the old rate of\r\n\r\ntax was $4,030.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rate of tax is $4,045.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a chargeable income of $75,000, the old rate of\r\n\r\ntax was $15,230.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rate of tax is $18,195.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a chargeable income of $100,000, the old rate\r\n\r\nof tax was $22,730.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rate of tax is $28,195.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of resident individuals who are\r\n\r\nmarried and have no children:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a chargeable income of $75,000, the old rate of\r\n\r\ntax was $14,630.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rate of tax is $17,395.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a charge income of $l00,000, the old rate of\r\n\r\ntax was 22,130.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rate of tax is $27,395.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These increases, Sir, are fairly substantial but I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think that they will cause hardship to  any\r\n\r\ntaxpayers. It can be argued that taxpayers in  these\r\n\r\nhigher groups of income could pay more tax. That  is\r\n\r\nprobably  true  and  I have no doubt  that  the  two\r\n\r\nGovernments will come round to this way of  thinking\r\n\r\nin due course. At the same time, however, I doubt if\r\n\r\nit is generally realised to what extent taxpayers in\r\n\r\nthese  income groups contribute in the way of income\r\n\r\ntax.  In this connection, I invite attention to  the 1955 Annual  Report of the Income  Tax  Department.\r\n\r\nFrom  that Report, it will be seen that some  19,000\r\n\r\nindividuals  contribute some $22  million  worth  of\r\n\r\ntax.   Of   these  individuals,  some  1,200   whose\r\n\r\nchargeable incomes exceed $30,000, on six  per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the total contribute $16 million in tax which is\r\n\r\n68  per cent of the total. While it can no doubt  be\r\n\r\nargued  that these individuals could pay more,  even\r\n\r\nthe  most biased critic must admit that they already\r\n\r\nmake a not unsubstantial contribution to the general\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  the people of Singapore. The  yield  of\r\n\r\nthese  proposals is now estimated at  slightly  over\r\n\r\n$3\ufffd million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> I second it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Sir, this morning we opposed the principle\r\n\r\nof  taxation  generally and I can show hon.  Members\r\n\r\none  or two ways by which to avoid this increase and\r\n\r\neven other increases in tax. One easy way is to  get\r\n\r\ncontrol  of our hard currency earnings-U.S, dollars.\r\n\r\nFor  years  and years, the United Kingdom  has  been\r\n\r\nutilising  oar dollars and taking full advantage  by\r\n\r\nsaying that the money was to be used for the good of\r\n\r\nthe Commonwealth whenever we raised this question in\r\n\r\nthe Legislative Council. Now, Commonwealth countries\r\n\r\nare   independent  countries.  They  remain  in  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  for  their mutual good.  Our  earnings\r\n\r\nshould be given to us. I quote one example of how we\r\n\r\nare   being  fleeced  indirectly.  We  are   getting\r\n\r\nconsumer goods from America via Hongkong and you can\r\n\r\nfind  them  anywhere in the market,  Sir.  Singapore\r\n\r\npays  the black-market price for them. How  is  this\r\n\r\ndone?  Non-business  people  may  not  be  able   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  how unless they take the pains  to  find\r\n\r\nout. We ask the Government for part or whole of  our\r\n\r\nhard  currency  earnings to import goods  from  hard\r\n\r\ncurrency countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

The steamers  touch\r\n\r\nat  Hongkong and black-market money, or free rate is\r\n\r\npaid  there.  The bills of lading  are  given  to  a\r\n\r\nmerchant  and we have to pay black-market  money  to\r\n\r\nthe Hongkong merchants.

Member is in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, in proposing this\r\n\r\namendment, as you have said, I am trying to  restore\r\n\r\nthe  old  percentages before the proposal to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe personal relief. It appears to me, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  not consistent in  its  policies.  I\r\n\r\npresume  that  the  withdrawal  of  the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\n(Amendment No. 2) Bill was due to the heavy pressure\r\n\r\nfrom  the  public and it appears to  me  that  since\r\n\r\nthere  is no heavy pressure from the public  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the rates of percentage on  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group,  the Government is not  proposing  to\r\n\r\nrestore  the old rates of income tax for  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group. This is wrong, Sir. It is not because\r\n\r\nthe  public  is  not  protesting against  these  new\r\n\r\nincreased rates but it is because the public is  not\r\n\r\naware  of these new rates. The concentration of  the\r\n\r\npublic  was on the reduction of the personal  relief\r\n\r\nand  this was just a sideline which may have  missed\r\n\r\nthe eye of the common man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will accept my proposal to\r\n\r\ngo  back to the old rates. If the original motion is\r\n\r\naccepted,  Sir,  I am sure that it will  cause  much\r\n\r\nmore  hardship  to  the lower income  group.  It  is\r\n\r\nsurprising  that the Hon. Financial Secretary  said,\r\n\r\n\"It  will not necessarily cause much hardship to the\r\n\r\nworkers.\"  I am afraid that he is not aware  of  the\r\n\r\nconditions of living of the lower income  group,  as\r\n\r\nhe  is a Minister and he lives on a far higher plane\r\n\r\nthan the lower income group or the common people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say, Sir, why it will affect the workers if\r\n\r\nthis  motion  is  adopted.  Take,  for  instance,  a\r\n\r\nbachelor who earns $3,500 a year. The $3,000 is free\r\n\r\nof  tax  and  the balance of $500 is  to  be  taxed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the new rates, Sir, the tax on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe $500 will be $25, but on the old rate he will be\r\n\r\ntaxed  $15  which, in the opinion of the Government,\r\n\r\nis a very small amount. The increase is only $10 and\r\n\r\nit does not matter. If the total income of a married\r\n\r\nperson  is  $6,000 a year, $5,000 is  free  of  tax.\r\n\r\nBased  on the new rate, the tax on the extra  $1,000\r\n\r\nwill  be  $50 and on the old rate, the tax  will  be\r\n\r\n$40 - a difference of $10. Now, this $10 may appear to\r\n\r\nthe  Government to be a very small sum  but  I  must\r\n\r\npoint  out, Sir, that this $10 is a very big sum  to\r\n\r\nthe ordinary worker. A worker who is a bachelor with\r\n\r\na very small income of, say, a few hundred dollars a\r\n\r\nmonth may have to support his parents or his younger\r\n\r\nsisters  and brothers, and in the case of a  married\r\n\r\nman,  he has to support his wife and children.  Now,\r\n\r\nthis  $10, as far as I know, may be enough for three\r\n\r\nor  four  days' marketing. I have known of cases  of\r\n\r\nthe  poorer class of people who spend a dollar a day\r\n\r\non  marketing and this $10 will allow them and their\r\n\r\nfamily,  I should say, to exist for ten days.  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid that the Government is wrong in thinking that\r\n\r\nit would not affect the workers at all when they say\r\n\r\nthat $10 is just a small figure. A drop in the ocean\r\n\r\nwill  not  matter much but that \"drop of  water\"  in\r\n\r\nterms of dollars and cents will matter very much  to\r\n\r\nthe poor worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that Members on both sides of the House\r\n\r\nwill  realise the hardship on the lower income group\r\n\r\nand will accept my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  rise to second the amendment and reserve my right\r\n\r\nto speak at a later stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That the words and figures\r\n\r\nproposed to be left out, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

There has been a complete  agreement\r\n\r\nachieved by way of compromise with the Federation on\r\n\r\nincome  tax  proposals for next year. Despite  that,\r\n\r\nSir, in view of matters that transpired both in this\r\n\r\nterritory and the Federation and as a result of  the\r\n\r\nfriendship existing between our two Chief Ministers,\r\n\r\nthere  was  a concession of a considerable character\r\n\r\nby  the Federation to our wishes. For this, I  think\r\n\r\nwe  ought  to  express both our appreciation  and  a\r\n\r\nsense of relief that they so conceded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To seek, Sir, now to overthrow the agreement\r\n\r\narrived   at  in  such  friendly  spirit  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation for so minor a matter is not to seek  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of this territory or even the poorer  people\r\n\r\ntherein  but  to  seek to embarrass  the  Government\r\n\r\npurely and simply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must recognise that every time we approach\r\n\r\ntaxation proposals, they are a pan-Malayan subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown said that $10 could\r\n\r\nmean  ten  marketing days. I would remind  him  that\r\n\r\naccording  to his own figures, before any  man  pays\r\n\r\nany  tax  at  all, he must earn $3,500 if  he  is  a\r\n\r\nbachelor,  that is, he earns $10 a day and  for  the\r\n\r\nwhole year,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  pays $25 - $2 a month - which means that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown  is trying to save him  $10  or  one\r\n\r\nday's pay. Sir, if this bachelor is really living on\r\n\r\n$1  a day, he is making an extraordinary saving  out\r\n\r\nof   which   he  can  well  afford  a   far   larger\r\n\r\ncontribution to the country. As for the married man,\r\n\r\nSir,  he  is paying this extra $10 only if he  earns\r\n\r\n$6,000  a year - $500 a month - and out of that  $500  a\r\n\r\nmonth,  he  is being asked to pay 5/6th  of  $1  per\r\n\r\nmonth. I do not know exactly how much 5/6th is, Sir.\r\n\r\nI  should say it is about 80 cents a month.  Now  to\r\n\r\ncall a man earning $600 a month poor and to seek  to\r\n\r\nembarrass  the Government because he has to  pay  80\r\n\r\ncents a month extra is to exaggerate and bring  into\r\n\r\ndisrepute  the  whole democratic procedure  and  the\r\n\r\npurpose of a debate on the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

He was,  if  I\r\n\r\nremember rightly, replying to some questions made by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Tanglin (Mr Ede). He  quoted  some\r\n\r\nrelevant  figures to show the amount of tax  payable\r\n\r\nunder  the  new rate as compared with the old  rate.\r\n\r\nThe  Hon. the Financial Secretary contended that the\r\n\r\nnew  structure would be well received  by  everybody\r\n\r\nprimarily   because   the   increase   in   tax   is\r\n\r\ninsignificantly small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Sir,  I\r\n\r\ndo not deny the fact that the increase under the new\r\n\r\nrate  may  be  small - only  a  few  dollars - but  then\r\n\r\nwhether  the  taxpayer will mind  it  or  not  is  a\r\n\r\ndifferent matter. I believe, in all sincerity,  that\r\n\r\nhe  will mind for whether the differential is $5  or\r\n\r\n$15,  it still means that the taxpayer will have  to\r\n\r\nforego  that sum of money for ever and that he  will\r\n\r\nhave to curtail his expenditure by that amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, the point I wish to make is something\r\n\r\nmore  fundamental and it is this. Is the new rate  a\r\n\r\njust  one? Let us examine the position before us.

The table here, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhope  can be easily followed by hon. Members without\r\n\r\ngoing  into  complicated statistics.  The  point  of\r\n\r\njustice  or  injustice which  I  said  just  now  is\r\n\r\nclearly  indicated not in the differential  increase\r\n\r\nbut in the percentage increase. Looking at column 5,\r\n\r\nhon.  Members will see that the percentage  increase\r\n\r\nin  income  tax plunges downwards as the  chargeable\r\n\r\nincome  rises  upwards.

Without the $500-flooring being removed  now,\r\n\r\nthe  maximum tax collection envisaged will be in the\r\n\r\nregion  of  $1,500,000.

Now,\r\n\r\nwho   belongs  to  the  lower  income  group,   Sir?\r\n\r\nAccording to the Central Provident Fund Ordinance, a\r\n\r\nperson  drawing  $200 should not be called  upon  to\r\n\r\nmake  any contribution to the Central Provident Fund\r\n\r\nbecause it was felt and it is still felt that a  man\r\n\r\ndrawing  $200  belongs to the  lower  income  group.\r\n\r\nComing now to the illustration given by the mover of\r\n\r\nthe  amendment, the Member for Cairnhill has already\r\n\r\nreplied and pointed out that a person who is  called\r\n\r\nupon to make an extra payment of $10 will be one who\r\n\r\nis  drawing,  if  a bachelor, $300  a  month;  if  a\r\n\r\nmarried man at least more than $500 a month and if a\r\n\r\nmarried  man  with children, he would have  to  draw\r\n\r\nabout $700 a month before he could be called upon to\r\n\r\nmake  this sacrifice - if one can call it - of an  extra\r\n\r\n$10  a  year  which works out at about  80  cents  a\r\n\r\nmonth.

It has been\r\n\r\nstressed  in  the  course of this  debate  and  past\r\n\r\ndebates that a pan-Malayan approach to income tax is\r\n\r\nessential. This increase in the rate of tax  on  the\r\n\r\nlower slabs of chargeable income has been agreed and\r\n\r\nmust stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of hardship, I refuse to believe\r\n\r\nthat   these   increases  can  cause  any   hardship\r\n\r\nwhatsoever. As has already been said in  the  course\r\n\r\nof this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndebate,  no member of the working class is  affected\r\n\r\nby income tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a certain amount of information - of which I\r\n\r\nhoped  to  spare  Members of the Assembly - about  the\r\n\r\nrates of tax which were paid in other countries  and\r\n\r\nperhaps hon. Members might like to hear them. I will\r\n\r\nstart  by  quoting from a comparative table  of  the\r\n\r\nrates  of  tax and the rates of allowances in  other\r\n\r\ncountries  besides Singapore. For  example,  in  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of  Personal Allowances, in  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nindividual  taxpayer  has a  Personal  Allowance  of\r\n\r\n$3,000.   In   the  United  Kingdom,  his   Personal\r\n\r\nAllowance  is  $1,020.  In  Australia,  he  has   no\r\n\r\nPersonal  Allowance. In India, he  has  no  Personal\r\n\r\nAllowance.  In  Ceylon, it  is  $1,285.  As  far  as\r\n\r\nMarried Allowances are concerned, in Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nMarried  Allowance is $5,000. In the United Kingdom,\r\n\r\nthe Married Allowance is $1,800. In Australia, it is\r\n\r\n$891.   In  Ceylon,  it  is  $2,250.  In  Singapore,\r\n\r\nallowances  are  paid  on  a  descending  scale   on\r\n\r\nchildren  up to nine in number. The total  allowance\r\n\r\nin  respect  of children in Singapore is $3,150.  In\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom, it is rather higher - $6,000.  In\r\n\r\nCeylon, it is $2,893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the debate last year, mention\r\n\r\nwas  made  of a table of rates of tax applicable  to\r\n\r\nother  territories  in  the colonial  empire.  Forty\r\n\r\nterritories  were  arranged in descending  order  of\r\n\r\nincidence  of  taxation. In  this  table,  Singapore\r\n\r\nstands   at   the  thirty-third  place.   The   only\r\n\r\nterritories  below her are Sierra  Leone,  the  Gold\r\n\r\nCoast,  Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia, Gibraltar  and\r\n\r\nHongkong. The difference between Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nterritories  above  her is very marked  indeed.  The\r\n\r\nlowest  income  group quoted in the table  is \ufffd500,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  $4,285. In Singapore, a married man  with\r\n\r\ntwo children would pay nothing. In the Carribean  he\r\n\r\nwould  pay  as  much  as $80. Even  in  the  Solomon\r\n\r\nIslands, he would pay $8. In short, the rate of  tax\r\n\r\nin  Singapore is probably amongst the lowest in  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some other interesting information, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhich I should like to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngive  to  hon. Members. They will be interested  to\r\n\r\nknow  that in Singapore, some $15 million a year  is\r\n\r\nsent  to  China as family remittances. At least  $16\r\n\r\nmillion  is sent to India. Lumping these two figures\r\n\r\ntogether,  it  works  out  at  $25  a  head  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation.  Again, the population on the  basis  of\r\n\r\n1954 figures, spent $18 million on entertainment tax\r\n\r\nor $15 a head of the total population. Contributions\r\n\r\nto totalisators and sweepstakes amounted to over $20\r\n\r\nmillion  a  year  or $16 a head of  the  population.\r\n\r\nAgain,  one in every four gainfully employed persons\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  has  an account in  the  Post  Office\r\n\r\nSavings Bank with an average holding of $375.

The   duty   on\r\n\r\ncigarettes  has been raised half way  to  Federation\r\n\r\nlevels  and  has resulted in the price of cigarettes\r\n\r\nbeing increased by five cents per packet of ten with\r\n\r\ncorresponding  increases  in  the  price  of  larger\r\n\r\npackets. It was also intended to raise the  duty  on\r\n\r\nwhat  is called Rhodesian-type tobacco which is used\r\n\r\nfor the manufacture of the better quality of machine\r\n\r\nmade  local cigarettes from $2.50 a lb, to  $4.50  a\r\n\r\nlb.  It was considered desirable in the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  important tobacco revenue that there should not\r\n\r\nbe too great a differential between the duty on this\r\n\r\ntype of tobacco and the duty on imported cigarettes.\r\n\r\nIn  fixing  the new rate of duty, the  previous  tax\r\n\r\ndifferential was maintained. It was thought that the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the  duties on cigarettes generally  had\r\n\r\nbeen  raised would probably lead to a greater demand\r\n\r\nfor   the   better  type  of  locally   manufactured\r\n\r\ncigarettes.   The  industry  employs   52   persons.\r\n\r\nHowever, representations were made to the Government\r\n\r\nthat   the  increase  in  price  of  these   locally\r\n\r\nmanufactured cigarettes would cause hardship to  the\r\n\r\nlabouring classes who are the main consumers of this\r\n\r\ntype  of  cigarette.  After consideration  of  these\r\n\r\nrepresentations, it was decided to restore the  duty\r\n\r\nto its previous level at $2.50 a lb. This action was\r\n\r\ntaken  on  the  understanding,  however,  that   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers of the local cigarettes would maintain\r\n\r\nthe  price  of the product at pre-Budget levels  and\r\n\r\nthat  any increase in price would immediately result\r\n\r\nin an increase in duty. This restoration of duty was\r\n\r\naffected by Gazette Notification No. S 321 of  which\r\n\r\nmention is made in the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, representations were made by the\r\n\r\nlocal manufacturers of cigars to the effect that the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  duty  on imported leaf  tobacco  would\r\n\r\nnecessitate   an  increase  in  price  which   would\r\n\r\ninjuriously affect their sales and, consequently,  a\r\n\r\nlocal    industry.    As   a   result    of    these\r\n\r\nrepresentations,  the  Government  has  decided   to\r\n\r\nrestore the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduty  on  imported leaf tobacco to pre-Budget  levels\r\n\r\nand  a  Gazette  Notification to  this  effect  will\r\n\r\nshortly be published.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in duty on imported cigarettes has\r\n\r\nresulted  in a slight increase in price.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink,  however,  that  this  increase  will   cause\r\n\r\nhardship.  If  it does in any particular  case,  the\r\n\r\nremedy  lies  in the hands of the consumer.  He  can\r\n\r\nreduce  his consumption or switch to cheaper  brands\r\n\r\nor  he  can  give up smoking altogether  which  will\r\n\r\nprobably  be to his benefit, if not to that  of  the\r\n\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the rate of tax on liquor calls\r\n\r\nfor no comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards petrol, the taxpayer can perhaps regard\r\n\r\nhimself  as  fortunate in so  far  as  he  lives  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and not in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been asked to draw attention to a printing\r\n\r\nerror which appeared in Sessional Paper No. S.L.  33\r\n\r\nof  1956.  \"Northern Island\" is quoted in the  Paper\r\n\r\ninstead   of  \"Northern  Ireland\".

I   also\r\n\r\ninvited  attention  to  the fact  that  our  Reserve\r\n\r\nposition  was reasonably strong and considerably  in\r\n\r\nexcess  of  the accepted minimum requirements  of  a\r\n\r\nterritory like Singapore. I therefore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuggested   that   the  Special  Reserve   Fund   be\r\n\r\nliquidated,  the  sum  of  $70  million,  that   is,\r\n\r\napproximately   four  months  revenue,   should   be\r\n\r\nretained  as  a liquid General Revenue  Balance  and\r\n\r\nthat   the   balance  of  our  Reserves  should   be\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  the Development Reserve  Fund.  The\r\n\r\nliquid  General Revenue Balance will be  the  sheet-anchor  of the Colony's finances. It will act  as  a\r\n\r\nRevenue and Expenditure Equalisation Fund from which\r\n\r\nunforeseen  shortfalls  in  revenue  and  unexpected\r\n\r\nincreases in expenditure can be met until such  time\r\n\r\nas   the  original  position  can  be  restored   by\r\n\r\nincreased taxation or by saving on expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion aims at giving effect to this proposal\r\n\r\nand  I  hope that it will have the support  of  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers.  The position before and after the approval\r\n\r\nof  this motion is shown in the Draft Estimates.  On\r\n\r\npages  6  and 7 of the Draft Estimates, hon. Members\r\n\r\nwill see the Statement of Assets and Liabilities  in\r\n\r\nthe old form. On page 8 will be seen a Statement  of\r\n\r\nAssets and Liabilities drawn up with Special Reserve\r\n\r\nFund  liquidated,  Singapore Improvement  Trust  and\r\n\r\nother   long-term  loans  charged  to  Expenditure - a\r\n\r\nmatter    which   was   touched   on   yesterday - the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund increased by $58 million  and  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Revenue Balance reduced to $70 million.  On\r\n\r\npage  367  of the Draft Estimates will be  seen  the\r\n\r\nreconstituted  Development  Reserve  Account.   This\r\n\r\naccount  shows  on  one  side  the  balance  in  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Reserve  Fund, contributions  from  the\r\n\r\nColonial    Development    and    Welfare     Funds,\r\n\r\nContributions   from  Revenue  to  Development   and\r\n\r\nRepayment   of   capital   on   existing   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust long-term loans. On the other side\r\n\r\nare  shown  the  sums estimated to be  required  for\r\n\r\nGeneral  Development  and loans to  quasi-Government\r\n\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of this method of presentation is\r\n\r\nthat it shows, on one side, the funds available  for\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  and,  on  the  other,  all  our  known\r\n\r\ncommitments  in  any particular year.

With 40\r\n\r\npupils in each class and the schools used for morning and afternoon \r\n\r\nsessions the schools thus provided accommodation for 1,120 pupils.\r\n\r\nThe other two classrooms were used for the teaching of music and vernacular languages.\r\n\r\nand, when the folding partition was drawn back, as a school hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955, the 7-year primary course was condensed to 6 years, and the schools accommodated\r\n\r\n2\ufffd streams in 15 classrooms. This means that there are three streams and two streams in alternate\r\n\r\nclasses, so that accommodation is provided for 1,200 pupils in hte two sessions. This economy\r\n\r\nhas meant the sacrifice of accommodation previously used for language teaching, so that\r\n\r\nclasses have had to be held in hte bicycle shed, the tiffin shed, and even in the open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary schools now being planned will be of 3 storeys and will have 18 classrooms\r\n\r\nwith accommodation for 1,440 pupils.

By these and other\r\n\r\neconomies it has been possible to accommodate 320 more pupils in each \r\n\r\nschool without any increase in the cost of building, assuming that the cost of labour and\r\n\r\nmaterials remains constant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As each school will accommodate more pupils, fewer schools need be build, so that there is a further saving on the cost of sites\r\n\r\nand the salaries of principals, clerks and servants. any further increase in\r\n\r\nsize, however, would have educational disadvantages to offset against the saving in cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two secondary technical schools were completed in 1956. They were originally\r\n\r\ndesigned as trade schols and have insufficient classrooms and laboratory accommodation. \r\n\r\nThe school to  be built in 1957 will accommodate more pupils and appreciably reduce\r\n\r\nthe cost per pupil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No academic secondary school was completed in 1955-6.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for the greatest possible economy in school building is kept\r\n\r\ncontinually in mide by a Working Party on whcih the Tresury, The P.W.D. and\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education are represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>GOVERNMENT EXPERIMENTAL PRAWN PONDS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry whether he will supply details of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  catch  of fish, prawns and crabs obtained  in\r\n\r\nthe  two Government experimental prawn ponds for the\r\n\r\nperiod  January - October 1956 and  the  sum  realised\r\n\r\ntherefrom;  and whether it is anticipated  that  the\r\n\r\ncatch for the year 1956 will exceed that for 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.
