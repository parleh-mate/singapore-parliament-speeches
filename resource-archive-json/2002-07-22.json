In line with current practice in\r\n\r\nthe  USA on potable use of reclaimed water, the Panel has\r\n\r\nrecommended  that  NEWater be used for  indirect  potable\r\n\r\nuse,  that  is,  mixing NEWater with  raw  water  in  the\r\n\r\nreservoirs  for  further  treatment  to  produce  potable\r\n\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB is now studying the Experts Panel's report and\r\n\r\nfindings  and  will  make  its  recommendation   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment in about two months' time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summary of the Experts Panel's report will be made\r\n\r\navailable on PUB's NEWater website to be launched on  1st\r\n\r\nAugust 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, to enhance public understanding of\r\n\r\nNEWater, PUB has stepped up its public education  efforts\r\n\r\nand will continue to do so in the coming months.  PUB has\r\n\r\nstarted  briefing the grassroots and community leaders  a\r\n\r\nfew weeks ago.  Our public education programme will cover\r\n\r\nvarious  areas.  For example, to assure the  public  that\r\n\r\nNEWater  is  safe to drink, PUB explains  the  technology\r\n\r\nemployed  in  the production of NEWater as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nquality it is able to attain with NEWater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, to help overcome any psychological\r\n\r\nbarrier,  PUB explains the experience of the USA  in  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  reclaimed water over the last  20-30  years  for\r\n\r\nindirect   potable  purpose.   At  two  of  the  briefing\r\n\r\nsessions I attended personally, 98% of the grassroots and\r\n\r\ncommunity leaders, having understood the process involved\r\n\r\nand  the quality achieved in NEWater, indicated that they\r\n\r\nhave no problem in drinking NEWater and accepting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  idea of indirect potable use of NEWater.  The  other\r\n\r\n2%  expressed  that  they still have  some  psychological\r\n\r\nbarrier  and  that  they  would like  to  understand  the\r\n\r\nprocess  more before they are ready to fully embrace  the\r\n\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB is now in the process of producing a\r\n\r\ndocumentary on NEWater.  It will be telecast over the  TV\r\n\r\nchannels  in August.  PUB will make available VCD  copies\r\n\r\nof  the  NEWater documentary to educational  institutions\r\n\r\nand grassroots organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By early next year, the public can also come to\r\n\r\nPUB's  new  Visitors' Centre at Bedok  Water  Reclamation\r\n\r\nPlant  to see the actual operations of the NEWater plant.\r\n\r\nThey will be able to see at first hand the use of leading\r\n\r\nedge membrane technology and ultra-violet process in  the\r\n\r\nproduction of NEWater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through these efforts in public education, we are\r\n\r\nconfident  that Singaporeans will come to recognise  that\r\n\r\nNEWater  is  indeed  a safe, affordable  and  sustainable\r\n\r\nsource  of  water supply for Singapore as we  strive  for\r\n\r\ngreater self-sufficiency in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, in the US where\r\n\r\nwater  reclamation has been carried out for more than  20\r\n\r\nyears,  only  one  or  two  of  the  three  methods  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is using had been used.  Why is there  a  need\r\n\r\nfor  us  to go through the three processes in Singapore's\r\n\r\ncase?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, the USA started the indirect\r\n\r\npotable  use  of reclaimed water in the  early  70s.   In\r\n\r\nthose  days,  some of these plants were using traditional\r\n\r\nfiltration  method.   Over the years,  with  advances  in\r\n\r\nmembrane  technology, we are now able to  achieve  better\r\n\r\nquality  at  a lower cost.  Technology has now  made  the\r\n\r\nproduction  of reclaimed water more efficient  and  cost-effective.   In  the USA today, indirect potable  use  of\r\n\r\nreclaimed  water  is a growing trend  as  more  and  more\r\n\r\ncities  face  the  challenge  of  water  shortage.    Our\r\n\r\nunderstanding is that new water reclamation plants in the\r\n\r\nUSA are increasingly using membrane technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three processes referred by Mdm Ho are what we\r\n\r\ncall  the dual-membrane and ultra-violet processes.  This\r\n\r\ncombination  of  processes is  gaining  popularity.   New\r\n\r\nwater  reclamation plants in the USA are moving  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection  of  adopting  dual-membrane  and  ultra-violet\r\n\r\nprocesses.   Earlier  this year, our  NEWater  plant  was\r\n\r\nawarded  the  excellent  award  by  the  National   Water\r\n\r\nResearch   Institution  in  the  USA  because   we   have\r\n\r\nestablished  a benchmark that is as best as anywhere  you\r\n\r\ncan  find  in the world in terms of our ability  to  make\r\n\r\ncost-effective use of technology to produce water quality\r\n\r\nof the highest standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, since one of the three\r\n\r\nmethods  was  assessed to be sufficient  to  process  the\r\n\r\nwater,  as  in  the  US case, to what  extent  would  the\r\n\r\nincremental  value be in having all three processes  done\r\n\r\nfor Singapore's case?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: would the additional two\r\n\r\nor   three  processes  not  be  adding  to  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nprocessing  the water and who would then be bearing  this\r\n\r\nadditional cost?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, firstly, let me explain that\r\n\r\neven  though dual-membrane is a two-step process, it does\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily  lead to higher cost.  Let  me  explain.\r\n\r\nWith reverse osmosis, we are going to achieve the highest\r\n\r\nquality  of  water.  What this means is that  before  the\r\n\r\nwater  goes through reverse osmosis, it has to go through\r\n\r\na stage of preparation first.  The whole purpose of micro-filtration or ultra-filtration used in the first step  of\r\n\r\nmembrane  application  is  to  filter  out  bigger   size\r\n\r\nimpurities, for example, bacteria.  By the time it  comes\r\n\r\nto  reverse  osmosis, the process will be filtering  out,\r\n\r\nfor   example,  viruses  which  are  much  smaller   than\r\n\r\nbacteria, as well as estrogenic compounds which are again\r\n\r\nmuch smaller than viruses and bacteria.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the whole process is to remove impurities\r\n\r\nin  a two-stage approach.  In this way, not only will  we\r\n\r\nbe  able to achieve higher quality water but, at the same\r\n\r\ntime, we will be able to optimise the cost performance of\r\n\r\ndual membrane.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it will lead to better cost optimisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mdm Ho asked who will bear the additional\r\n\r\ncost.  Sir, I want to emphasise that the introduction  of\r\n\r\nNEWater  does  not  add to higher cost  of  future  water\r\n\r\nsupply  in  Singapore.   In fact, the  whole  purpose  of\r\n\r\nintroducing  NEWater is to reduce the increased  cost  of\r\n\r\nfuture  supply  of water in Singapore.   Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  will  remember  that until the  concept  of  water\r\n\r\nreclamation   came  about,  the  next   alternative   for\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  really  to go for desalination.   I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned  in this House on 22nd May 2002 that  when  you\r\n\r\ncompare  the  cost of water reclamation - NEWater  versus\r\n\r\ndesalination  - in terms of capital cost,  the  cost  for\r\n\r\nNEWater is about half that of desalination.  In terms  of\r\n\r\nenergy  consumption, it is about one-quarter to one-fifth\r\n\r\nthat  of  desalination.  As a result, the total  cost  of\r\n\r\nNEWater  production is about half that  of  desalination.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  the introduction of  NEWater  actually\r\n\r\nhelps  us  to prevent the need to increase the prices  of\r\n\r\nwater  in  the  future  because  with  this  lower   cost\r\n\r\nalternative, we are now able to better contain  the  cost\r\n\r\nof water in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  how  soon  does  he  think  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will  want  to  use  NEWater  for   domestic\r\n\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, as I have mentioned earlier,\r\n\r\nPUB is now looking into the recommendation by the Experts\r\n\r\nPanel  and  PUB expects to put forward its recommendation\r\n\r\nto  the Government sometime in September.  Based on PUB's\r\n\r\nrecommendation,   the  ENV  will  then   work   out   the\r\n\r\nintroduction plan.  At this moment, I would not  want  to\r\n\r\njump  the  gun because the next step is for PUB to  study\r\n\r\nthe  recommendation from the Experts Panel  carefully  so\r\n\r\nthat  by the time it comes to a decision, we will be able\r\n\r\nto move forward with complete confidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether there is any plan to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nuse  NEWater  directly and whether there is any  need  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the NEWater further by altering the  PH  of  the\r\n\r\nNEWater after production?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, NEWater will be used in two\r\n\r\nways.  Firstly, for  non-potable use in industry and  the\r\n\r\ncommercial  sector, NEWater will be used directly.   This\r\n\r\nwill begin in January next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked whether there is any need to\r\n\r\nadjust  the  PH  level of NEWater.  The  answer  is  yes,\r\n\r\nbecause  NEWater  is so pure that the PH  level  at  this\r\n\r\nmoment  is  about 6.2 to 6.5 which is below  the  neutral\r\n\r\nlevel  of 7.  So what PUB will do is that NEWater,  after\r\n\r\nproduction, will be stabilised before it is delivered  to\r\n\r\nthe wafer fab plants starting in January next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second purpose is for potable use. As I have\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier, the Experts Panel is recommending that\r\n\r\nwe  make  use  of NEWater for potable use in an  indirect\r\n\r\nmanner.   This  means pumping NEWater into the  reservoir\r\n\r\nand  mixing  it  with raw water in the  reservoir.   From\r\n\r\nthere, it will be reprocessed again into PUB water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INTEGRATION OF MAIN RESERVOIRS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for the\r\n\r\nEnvironment, in view of our Prime Minister mentioning the\r\n\r\npossibility of joining our three main reservoirs into one\r\n\r\nhuge  catchment  area, has his Ministry  carried  out  an\r\n\r\nenvironmental impact study whether such a project should,\r\n\r\nin fact, be carried out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe the\r\n\r\nMember  is  referring  to PUB's  plan  to  integrate  the\r\n\r\nvarious  reservoirs to enhance the overall yield  of  our\r\n\r\nlocal  catchments.

Although there are many existing regional and sub-regional organisations in Asia, such as ASEAN, ARF, South\r\n\r\nAsian   Association  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC),\r\n\r\nIndian  Ocean  Rim  Association for Regional  Cooperation\r\n\r\n(IOR-ARC)  and  the Gulf Cooperation Council,  there  is,\r\n\r\nhowever, minimal interaction between them.

After\r\n\r\ndiscounting for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninflation, the real earnings rose from $2,263  to  $2,535\r\n\r\nat  an  annualised rate of 3.9% during the  same  period.\r\n\r\nEarnings data prior to 1998 are not comparable due  to  a\r\n\r\nchange  in  the collection methodology.  The hon.  Member\r\n\r\nasked  for  data  from 1997.  Because of  the  change  in\r\n\r\ncollection  methodology,  I gave  the  figures  for  1998\r\n\r\nonwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, females in Singapore generally earn less than\r\n\r\nmales  at  the aggregate level.  This is not  unlike  the\r\n\r\nexperience in many other countries.  In 2001, the average\r\n\r\nmonthly earnings of females was 72% that of males.   This\r\n\r\nreflects  the  higher concentration of females  in  lower\r\n\r\npaying   occupations   due  to  the  poorer   educational\r\n\r\nattainment  of the older cohorts of female workers.   The\r\n\r\ntendency  for  females  to withdraw  from  the  workforce\r\n\r\nbecause of childcare and household responsibilities  also\r\n\r\nreduced  the  average years of service and experience  of\r\n\r\nworking  females.  With our seniority-based wage  system,\r\n\r\nfemales, as a group, will therefore earn less than males.\r\n\r\nFor  the younger age group, the wage gap differential  is\r\n\r\ngenerally smaller.  In fact, in the age group  of  25  to\r\n\r\n29,  women  working as managers, professionals, associate\r\n\r\nprofessionals  and  technicians, and  service  and  sales\r\n\r\nworkers  actually earn more than their male counterparts.\r\n\r\nOther  factors contributing to the gender wage  disparity\r\n\r\ninclude  differences in skills, qualifications, age,  job\r\n\r\nnature and position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wage gap was largely unchanged over the last few\r\n\r\nyears.  It was also 72% in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the underlying concern in Dr Neo's question on\r\n\r\nwage  gap is whether women in Singapore are discriminated\r\n\r\nagainst in employment.  Average monthly earnings of women\r\n\r\nhave  significantly  increased  over  the  years.   While\r\n\r\ndifferences  in  wages  still  exist,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nemphasise that it is not the result of discrimination  at\r\n\r\nwork.   Rather,  it  is  due  to legitimate  work-related\r\n\r\nreasons  such  as working experience, years  of  service,\r\n\r\ntypes of jobs held and skills, as I mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy on employment is based on\r\n\r\nthe  principles  of equal opportunities and  meritocracy.\r\n\r\nOur  employment  practice emphasises equal  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  all, and a reward system based on performance.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Civil Service adopted the principle  of  equal\r\n\r\npay  for  equal work since 1962.  NTUC and its affiliated\r\n\r\nunions   make  no  distinction  between  male  or  female\r\n\r\nmembers.  In collective agreements signed between  unions\r\n\r\nand  employers, the principle of equal pay  for  work  of\r\n\r\nequal value is the norm.  In addition, the National Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil,  which is the national tripartite advisory  body\r\n\r\non  wages, formulates wage increase guidelines each  year\r\n\r\nbased  on  key economic indicators, such as  GDP  growth,\r\n\r\nproductivity,       inflation      and      international\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.

The way  to  narrow\r\n\r\nthis  gap is, in fact, through education.  As I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier  on in my main reply, in the age group of  25  to\r\n\r\n29,  the  women  actually earn more than  the  men.   And\r\n\r\nthrough better education, we will find the women entering\r\n\r\nthe  labour force will have as good an education, and  as\r\n\r\ngood a training as their male counterparts, and they will\r\n\r\nearn the same wages as their male counterparts.  So, with\r\n\r\neducation, we will gradually narrow the gap.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Ministry done? In terms of continuing\r\n\r\neducation  and  training,  my  Ministry  also  makes   no\r\n\r\ndistinction  between male and female  workers.   We  give\r\n\r\nequal encouragement and support to women who come forward\r\n\r\nto  undergo skills retraining or upgrading.  In fact,  we\r\n\r\nhave   many  programmes  which  help  the  lower  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers,  and you will find a disproportionate number  of\r\n\r\nwomen  among  the lower skilled.  They are the  ones  who\r\n\r\nstand  to  best  benefit from this programme  for  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading.   And we will continue to implement programmes\r\n\r\nto  help the lower skilled to uplift their skills for the\r\n\r\nnew  jobs in the new economy.  This is the way for us  to\r\n\r\nspeed up the narrowing of the wage gap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can be done? As I said, we will continue\r\n\r\nto  look  at  more  skills upgrading programmes  for  the\r\n\r\ncohorts  of  women  who  are already  in  the  workforce,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  older women in their  40s  and  above.\r\n\r\nThey  have  poorer education and lower level  of  skills.\r\n\r\nThe  way for them to narrow the wage gap is, in fact,  to\r\n\r\ngo  for skills upgrading, and take advantage of the  many\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that  we  have, whether it  is  the  National\r\n\r\nSkills   Recognition  System,  the  Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme  or  one  of our strategic manpower  conversion\r\n\r\nprogrammes that will help them to acquire new skills  for\r\n\r\njobs   in   different   areas.   If   they   take   these\r\n\r\nopportunities to upgrade themselves, I am sure they  will\r\n\r\nbe able to earn a higher wage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister for the\r\n\r\noutcome of the study which he agreed to look into when  I\r\n\r\nraised  the  issue  of  the  wage  gap  in  1997  on  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  faced  by women in employment,  such  as  the\r\n\r\ngeneral opinion of the employers with regard to the  role\r\n\r\nof  women  in  the workplace, and also the difficulty  of\r\n\r\nbalancing work with family responsibilities?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since 1997, or\r\n\r\nearlier   than  that,  my  Ministry  has  been   actively\r\n\r\npromoting   family-friendly  human  resource   management\r\n\r\npractices.

These are  issues\r\n\r\nwhich are constantly being looked at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the specific study that the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  said that she raised in 1997, I have to  look  it\r\n\r\nup, because I do not have the answer with me right now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, one of the reasons cited for\r\n\r\nthe wage gap of females compared to their counterparts is\r\n\r\nthat they have withdrawn from the workforce to mind their\r\n\r\nchildren.  I would like to ask the Minister whether there\r\n\r\nis  a  possibility for a scheme to be examined  which  is\r\n\r\nsimilar to the National Service scheme for NSmen to  make\r\n\r\nup  for  the  loss of their 21/2 years' national  service\r\n\r\ntraining.   Normally,  they are given   increments.   For\r\n\r\nwomen  who  withdraw  from  the  workforce  to  do  their\r\n\r\n\"national  service\" in looking after their  children,  if\r\n\r\nthey should re-enter the workforce, is there a chance for\r\n\r\nthem  to  be  given  some  kind of  recognition  for  the\r\n\r\n\"national service\" that they have performed, so  that  we\r\n\r\nminimise the wage gap between male and female workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there\r\n\r\nis  a  tendency  to try to draw parallels  all  over  the\r\n\r\nplace,  and  we  can arrive at very unusual  conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe  reason  why  Government gives  increments  to  NSmen\r\n\r\nwithin  the  civil  service and  encourages  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  to give the males who have to perform 21/2  years\r\n\r\nof national service the same recognition is self-evident.\r\n\r\nBecause  they have to give up 21/2 years of their  career\r\n\r\nto  perform national service at a very nominal  allowance\r\n\r\nfrom the Ministry of Defence.  So, we try to make up  for\r\n\r\nthem  by encouraging employers in the private sector  and\r\n\r\nin  the  civil  service to give them two increments  when\r\n\r\nthey join the service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for women taking time off to mind their families\r\n\r\nand look after the children, I think there are many other\r\n\r\nways people can balance work and home.  To have a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrigid  structure whereby you say that the  employer  will\r\n\r\nhave  to pay the woman worker X number of credits by  way\r\n\r\nof  increments upon rejoining the company after a certain\r\n\r\nnumber of years, I think this would increase the rigidity\r\n\r\nin  our labour market.  The more rigid we make our labour\r\n\r\nmarket,  the  more difficult it is for us to achieve  the\r\n\r\nkind  of  growth and competitiveness that we  want.   The\r\n\r\nworld  is  not getting any more friendlier  in  terms  of\r\n\r\neconomic  competition.  On the contrary,  competition  is\r\n\r\nheating  up.   The more we introduce these little  tweaks\r\n\r\nhere  and there, the more difficult we will make  it  for\r\n\r\nthe  women  to  get  work in the future.   So,  far  from\r\n\r\nhelping  women,  such  rigidity may discriminate  against\r\n\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge Members to be careful when\r\n\r\nadvancing ideas about how we want to help the women.  The\r\n\r\nway to help them is actually through education and skills\r\n\r\ntraining.  If we equip them well, they will be needed  by\r\n\r\nthe employers when the economy turns around and picks up.\r\n\r\nThey will command a wage that the market will decide  and\r\n\r\nthe  employers will pay.  If we try to include all  these\r\n\r\nlittle  ideas  of how to favour them, we will  discourage\r\n\r\nemployers from employing more women.  So, let us be  very\r\n\r\ncareful  about what we want to do.  Are we here  to  help\r\n\r\nthe  women workers to bridge the gap, or are we going  to\r\n\r\nmake  life more difficult for them?  I would urge you  to\r\n\r\nbe  very circumspect in proposing such measures.  On  the\r\n\r\npart  of the Government, we will continue to try to  help\r\n\r\nand  equip  our  women workforce, which is  half  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation.   If  we  do not give  them  every  means  to\r\n\r\nupgrade themselves so that they can perform well  in  the\r\n\r\nnew  economy,  then  we  are doing  ourselves  a  serious\r\n\r\ndisservice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure all hon.

I think the recent changes  in  child\r\n\r\nsick  leave  is  a good example.  But will  his  Ministry\r\n\r\npursue  and encourage right across civil service more  of\r\n\r\nthis  type  of benefits?  In fact, the approach  and  the\r\n\r\nmindset  of  Government  should be  to  encourage  better\r\n\r\nsharing of responsibilities, because ultimately that  is,\r\n\r\nin fact, the way to go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister has focused very much on the\r\n\r\nschemes to educate and retrain to close the gap.

My\r\n\r\nquestion  is: are we doing a review of why  this  is  so?\r\n\r\nBecause, I think, society places values on jobs,  and  we\r\n\r\nare  very  prone to just paying for the jobs  that  bring\r\n\r\ndirect  economic benefit and we do not give enough weight\r\n\r\nto  the  jobs  that enable the economic  activity  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried out in terms of, for example, child care-type  or\r\n\r\nteaching-type jobs.

Will the Ministry review\r\n\r\nthe  way jobs are structured and valued to see if we  can\r\n\r\nmove this in the right direction?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to\r\n\r\nthe  Nominated Member's first point, yes,  I  agree  with\r\n\r\nher.   We should continue to work, we should continue  to\r\n\r\nchisel  away  at  some mindset about how  to  help  women\r\n\r\nbetter cope with work and family.  I mentioned earlier on\r\n\r\nthings  that  give  recognition to companies  that  adopt\r\n\r\nfamily-friendly practices.  I think this would help.  But\r\n\r\nit is not going to result in an overnight transformation.\r\n\r\nThe  civil  service will also incorporate some  of  these\r\n\r\nideas\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabout  family-friendly practices, and gradually more  can\r\n\r\nbe  adopted where it is possible.  I think this is  being\r\n\r\nlooked at.  Various Ministries, including the PSD,  would\r\n\r\nbe looking at how they can make work in the civil service\r\n\r\nmore family-friendly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other point about some jobs\r\n\r\ncommanding  a lower salary and whether the Ministry  will\r\n\r\nlook  at  how these jobs are rated, we know,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthat  we  do not have wage controls, and we do  not  have\r\n\r\nminimal wages in Singapore for very good reason,  ie,  to\r\n\r\nallow  the  marketplace to operate freely.   I  think  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  quite  difficult, and I do  not  think  it  is\r\n\r\ndesirable  for  us to go around setting wages  for  child\r\n\r\ncare givers or teachers, or for other vocations.  We have\r\n\r\nto accept that wages are best set by the market to ensure\r\n\r\nthat   there   is  appropriate  reward  for  the   effort\r\n\r\ncontributed.  If, in fact, there is a serious shortage of\r\n\r\nchild  care  givers  in  our  child  care  centres,   for\r\n\r\ninstance,  then the market will respond.  The people  who\r\n\r\noperate  child care centres will have to bid  higher  for\r\n\r\nthe  workers that they need, and for the quality  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers that they need, they will have to pay more.   So,\r\n\r\nI  think, we must let the market forces operate.   It  is\r\n\r\neither  we believe in it or we do not.  Then, we have  to\r\n\r\ngo  in  and  start setting wages for every sector,  every\r\n\r\nvocation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, let me cite an interesting point,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  that  occupational groups show  the  wage  gap\r\n\r\nbetween  male  and  female.   For  instance,  within   an\r\n\r\noccupational  group,  there  may  be  a  wage  difference\r\n\r\nbetween male and female.  But the occupational groups are\r\n\r\nfairly  large.  So you have, for instance, a group called\r\n\r\nplant   and  machine  operators  within  an  occupational\r\n\r\nclassification of our labour force.  You will  find  that\r\n\r\nmales  tend  to  earn  a lot more than  females  in  this\r\n\r\noccupational group.  Is it because they are discriminated\r\n\r\nagainst?   Or  is it because the work they  do  is  being\r\n\r\nunder-valued?   The answer is no.  The  answer  is  that,\r\n\r\ninterestingly  enough,  in this  particular  occupational\r\n\r\ngroup, females tend to concentrate in occupations such as\r\n\r\nelectronic component assembly.  They work\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  an electronics factory as assembly production workers\r\n\r\nwhich  generally pays less than the other group of  plant\r\n\r\nand  machinery operators, which include bus drivers,  for\r\n\r\ninstance.   There are not that many female  bus  drivers,\r\n\r\nand  bus  drivers are paid quite well compared  to  these\r\n\r\nassembly line workers in an electronics factory.  So,  as\r\n\r\na  result,  you  will find that within this  occupational\r\n\r\ngroup,  there is this difference in wage gap.  So  should\r\n\r\nwe  then  go in and tell employers that, no, within  this\r\n\r\noccupational group, you have a big wage gap, you have  to\r\n\r\ndo  something  to  fix that wage gap,  and  you  have  to\r\n\r\naddress  the fact that the women are earning less?   But,\r\n\r\nin  fact, within every occupational group, you find  this\r\n\r\ndistortion.  So, it is not easy for us to go in nor is it\r\n\r\ndesirable  for  us to artificially go and try  to  bridge\r\n\r\nthis  gap.  As I said, the only way to bridge the gap  is\r\n\r\nto equip the women with the skills to do the higher value-added jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister said\r\n\r\nearlier that he did not have the outcome of the study  of\r\n\r\nthe  wage gap.

I  am\r\n\r\ndisappointed because I feel that the Minister could  have\r\n\r\nbetter prepared for this Question for Oral Answer.

I do not see any  reason  or\r\n\r\njustification to say that I have not adequately given the\r\n\r\nhon. Member an answer on the wage gap.  With regard to  a\r\n\r\nprevious  study,  if she has a specific interest  in  the\r\n\r\noutcome on whatever other studies that she requested for,\r\n\r\nwe will be prepared to address those points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would take her last point about females having the\r\n\r\nlowest gross monthly income.  I think this is taken as  a\r\n\r\ngroup,  as a whole, and I have spent some time to explain\r\n\r\nwhy  this  is  so - partly because of our seniority-based\r\n\r\nwage  scale system.  If you take any group, you will find\r\n\r\nwithin  the  group,  as  I  mentioned  earlier  on,   the\r\n\r\noccupational  group of plant and machinery  operators,  a\r\n\r\nsituation where women tend to congregate at a lower  wage\r\n\r\nlevel, simply because they are actually doing those  jobs\r\n\r\n-  electronics factory production workers rather than men\r\n\r\ndoing   more  higher  value-added  jobs  operating   more\r\n\r\ncomplicated and sophisticated machinery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see what other explanation is there to\r\n\r\ngive,  apart from what I have already said that the women\r\n\r\nare  having  this  lower income or earn lower  wages  for\r\n\r\nfairly  sound reasons.  Not that I agree with  them,  but\r\n\r\nthe reasons are the results of history.  20-30 years ago,\r\n\r\nnot  all  the women got the same education as their  male\r\n\r\ncounterparts in that cohort.  It just was not so.  Today,\r\n\r\nthe  women  in  their 40s and late 40s generally  have  a\r\n\r\nlower  level  of  education and skills  than  their  male\r\n\r\ncounterparts.  Therefore, they are not doing exactly  the\r\n\r\nsame job; so, they do not get the same pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me why there are fewer women in\r\n\r\nmanagement and executive positions, this will change.  As\r\n\r\nI  said, for the younger cohort, they are already as well\r\n\r\neducated  as  their  male  counterparts.   They  will  be\r\n\r\ncompeting  for  the same jobs.  But in our  system  where\r\n\r\nthere  is seniority-based wage scale, those women who  do\r\n\r\nnot  want to carry on with their career development,  who\r\n\r\ndrop out of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkforce well before they make it to the higher level of\r\n\r\nmanagement structure, will result in the group as a whole\r\n\r\nagain still having a lower pay.  Because for everyone who\r\n\r\ndrops  out,  you find a man has moved ahead of  a  woman.\r\n\r\nSo,  as a result, taking the women as a group, they  will\r\n\r\nbe  at the lower end of the pyramid, and more men will be\r\n\r\nmoving  up to the higher level of the management pyramid.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result, if you take the group as a whole, men will\r\n\r\nstill  be earning more than women.  But that is a  choice\r\n\r\non  the part of the women.  Do they want to carry  on  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  their career to the fullest, go to  the  highest\r\n\r\nlevel in management?  This, in our system of meritocracy,\r\n\r\nis  entirely up to the women to choose.  It is  a  matter\r\n\r\nfor  them to choose, to decide how far they want  to  go,\r\n\r\nhow  do  they balance their home and career.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  we  should have a system where we  guarantee  that\r\n\r\nwithin   our   labour  force,  there  should   be   equal\r\n\r\nrepresentation,   or  a  guarantee  in   our   management\r\n\r\nstructure that there should be equal representation.  The\r\n\r\nfact  is this is how the market operates.  If women  want\r\n\r\nto  make  the  effort  to  excel  in  their  career,  the\r\n\r\nopportunities are there.  There is a level playing field.\r\n\r\nThey  can compete for the job; they can compete  for  the\r\n\r\nposition,  and  they will be paid for their  performance.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  think this is a fair system, and it is  a  system\r\n\r\nthat should be allowed to continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, we have just\r\n\r\nratified  ILO  Convention 100 on equal pay  for  work  of\r\n\r\nequal  value.

Secondly, the Convention\r\n\r\nalso  requires  us  to put in place  some  mechanism  for\r\n\r\nmonitoring wages for both males and females.

They  are   also\r\n\r\ncountries with a wage gap.  So, having a wage gap per  se\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean  that  one  is  not  in  compliance  with\r\n\r\nConvention 100.  They will have to look at the details of\r\n\r\nthe  statistics.   As  I  said in the  main  answer,  our\r\n\r\npractice and implementation of wage policy are fair.   It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  discriminate against women.  We pay  the  same\r\n\r\nwages  for the same work that is being done. If ILO  were\r\n\r\nto query why a wage gap arises in Singapore's context, we\r\n\r\nwill be able to explain why this wage gap has arisen,  as\r\n\r\nin  the  same  way  that I am trying to explain  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, with so\r\n\r\nmany  women speaking, I feel compelled to join the  crowd\r\n\r\nso  that  all  of us can speak.  I fully agree  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that the solution to bridge the gap is  through\r\n\r\neducation.  But you find that, in the future, when  women\r\n\r\nget  more  educated, it will be a waste if we  lose  this\r\n\r\nvery valuable resource when family kicks in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether you can help change the rules.\r\n\r\nI think it is all very well to say that discrimination is\r\n\r\nnot  there.   But it is true that, when the family  kicks\r\n\r\nin,  the  woman takes a back seat and she will  lose  her\r\n\r\nskills if she does not actively try to get back into  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.  So I wonder whether you could help change the\r\n\r\nmindset  and start much more earlier in the  day  in  the\r\n\r\neducation  process to tell the women that life  is  about\r\n\r\nvarious  stages  and to think ahead for the  future.   We\r\n\r\nshould  change women's mindset on how they can  get  back\r\n\r\ninto the workforce, how to help change processes, helping\r\n\r\nthem  to  work  from  home, how to actively  change  work\r\n\r\nprocesses within the workplace so that women can continue\r\n\r\nto  retain a level of skills and to get connected to  the\r\n\r\nworkplace so that, when their children are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngrowing, they can get back actively into the workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, we in fact\r\n\r\nalready  do  some  of these works.  We have  a  programme\r\n\r\ncalled \"Back-to-Work\".  Back-to-Work is a programme  that\r\n\r\nwas designed to help women who have left the workforce to\r\n\r\nbe  retrained before re-entering the workforce.  And  the\r\n\r\nwhole  Back-to-Work  programme  is  also  geared  towards\r\n\r\ngiving moral support and encouragement to women who  have\r\n\r\nleft  the  workforce for some years and now want  to  re-enter  it  but  because  of the  change  in  the  working\r\n\r\nenvironment,  they do not feel adequate or prepared.   So\r\n\r\nthe Back-to-Work programme addresses these issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Back-to-Work programme during this\r\n\r\nperiod  of  high  unemployment  is  a  bit  difficult  to\r\n\r\nimplement because, first, you got to have the  jobs.   We\r\n\r\nstarted  the  programme  in 1996  when  the  economy  was\r\n\r\nbooming,  tight labour market and very limited supply  of\r\n\r\nworkers.  So we introduced this Back-to-Work programme to\r\n\r\ntry  to  draw  the women who had left the workforce  back\r\n\r\ninto  it.   But  since then, the economic  situation  has\r\n\r\nturned  unfavourably.  Jobs have been harder to come  by.\r\n\r\nI  remember I did inform this House during the  Committee\r\n\r\nof  Supply  that we are in fact putting this at  a  lower\r\n\r\npriority  instead.  Maybe when the economy turns  around,\r\n\r\nor  when we encounter a similar situation where there are\r\n\r\nmore  jobs available, then we should refine this Back-to-Work  programme to address precisely the issue  that  the\r\n\r\nMember has mentioned, ie, how to help women re-enter  the\r\n\r\nworkforce after a period of time spent with the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> The Minister said earlier that more\r\n\r\nwomen are in the electronics factory jobs.

Many  who were re-employed  probably  end  up\r\n\r\ntaking  a  lower  paying job than what  they  had  before\r\n\r\nbecause  the employment market is not so favourable  now.\r\n\r\nAs to how many of them had undergone specific retraining,\r\n\r\nI  do  not have the figures with me.  I know that, for  a\r\n\r\nstart,  our Skills Redevelopment Programme has a  lot  of\r\n\r\nwomen  participation  in  it.  Many  of  the  electronics\r\n\r\nfactory  workers who were retrenched, or whose jobs  were\r\n\r\nvulnerable to retrenchment, in fact, had undergone skills\r\n\r\nredevelopment training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the 119,000 women, whom the Member quoted as\r\n\r\nearning  less than $400 a month, she asked what  type  of\r\n\r\njobs  they  are in.  I think most of these  are  actually\r\n\r\npart-time  workers supplementing the family  income.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  some of them could be doing the lower-end  jobs,\r\n\r\nin  conservancy type of work.  But I think you will  find\r\n\r\nquite a number of women doing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npart-time work, for instance, NTUC FairPrice supermarkets\r\n\r\nemploy  a  fairly  large complement of cashiers  who  are\r\n\r\nwomen  doing  part-time work because these are  the  jobs\r\n\r\nthat are conveniently located within the new towns, close\r\n\r\nto  their  homes, and many women like to  take  on  these\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> The Minister has cited the\r\n\r\nlagging salary between the male and female as one of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  for  the gap.  Has his Ministry found  that  the\r\n\r\nlagging  salary  between the male and female  constitutes\r\n\r\none  of  the  reasons for our difficulties in luring  the\r\n\r\nbetter educated women back to work?  And if that were so,\r\n\r\nwhat is his Ministry doing to address this issue?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the salary gap,\r\n\r\nas  I  said  in  my  main  answer,  is  one  of  national\r\n\r\nstatistics.  You take all the women workers on one  side,\r\n\r\nyou  average their salary, you take all the male  workers\r\n\r\non the other side, average their salary, and you get this\r\n\r\ngap  of 72%.  But, in fact, if you look at the women with\r\n\r\ntheir male counterparts, if they are of equal capability,\r\n\r\nequal seniority, doing the same jobs in the company, I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  they  are  paid  any  less  than  their  male\r\n\r\ncounterpart.   So  the point that you mentioned  in  your\r\n\r\nquestion  does  not  arise.  You  are  confusing  overall\r\n\r\nstatistics with an individual situation.  We have overall\r\n\r\nstatistics  which  show  a gap.  But  at  the  individual\r\n\r\nlevel, it is a totally level playing field.  A woman  who\r\n\r\nhas  the same years of seniority in the company, who does\r\n\r\nexactly  the same job, will get the same pay as the  male\r\n\r\nworker.  I do not think there are companies that practise\r\n\r\nthis  kind of discrimination.  I know that the  NTUC,  in\r\n\r\ntheir  collective  agreements,  ensures  that  all  their\r\n\r\nmembers,  regardless of whether they are male  or  female\r\n\r\nworkers,  get exactly the same salary for doing the  same\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\njust  going  back  a little bit to the ILO,  under  CEDAW\r\n\r\n(Convention  on  Elimination  of  Discrimination  Against\r\n\r\nWomen)  and  our  legalistic framework, the  Constitution\r\n\r\nstates that everyone is the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsame,  whatever  race or religion,  and  the  part  about\r\n\r\ngender  is  missing, and that is why we have  signed  the\r\n\r\nCEDAW  with reservation.  How then would the Ministry  be\r\n\r\nin   compliance  with  the  ILO  where  this   legalistic\r\n\r\nframework, to a certain extent, in my opinion, is lacking\r\n\r\nwhere   gender   issues  and  wage  differentiation   are\r\n\r\nconcerned as a result of that?  Could you please  explain\r\n\r\nhow  the  Ministry sees these two documents, the ILO  and\r\n\r\nCEDAW and our legalistic framework?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before we ratify\r\n\r\nany  international  convention, we will  quite  carefully\r\n\r\nstudy  the  obligations  under the  convention.   We  had\r\n\r\nstudied  our obligations under Convention 100, regardless\r\n\r\nof  what the Nominated Member mentioned.  I would like to\r\n\r\nassure this House that we will not be in violation of the\r\n\r\nrequirements of Convention 100.  We will be able to  meet\r\n\r\nthe    statutory   requirement   after   ratifying   this\r\n\r\nConvention.  As I have explained, the Government does not\r\n\r\npractise  any  discrimination in its  wage  policy.   The\r\n\r\nemployment   market   itself  does  not   practise   wage\r\n\r\ndiscrimination.  Wages are different because they are not\r\n\r\ndoing  the same job.  That is the basic point.   I  think\r\n\r\nILO  will  understand  why  this  is  so.   There  is  no\r\n\r\nregulation that explicitly says that women should be paid\r\n\r\nless  than  men.   In  fact, it  is  the  contrary.   The\r\n\r\nprinciple   of   the  Government  has  all   along   been\r\n\r\nmeritocracy.

Elderly suicide  is,\r\n\r\nhowever,  a  multi-faceted issue  requiring  a  concerted\r\n\r\neffort  among the various stakeholders, including  health\r\n\r\nand social service providers, families and the police.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the interventions for potential suicide\r\n\r\ncases are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, counselling which is currently provided by\r\n\r\nFamily  Service  Centres,  SAGE Counselling  Centre,  the\r\n\r\nSamaritans of Singapore and hospitals;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, specialised treatment, including\r\n\r\ncounselling for psychiatric cases, which is available  at\r\n\r\nthe Institute of Mental Health (IMH); and,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, hospice care which provides for the\r\n\r\nmanagement of patients, including the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nelderly,  with serious illnesses where curative treatment\r\n\r\nis  no  longer  appropriate.  Some examples  include  the\r\n\r\nDover Park Hospice and St Joseph's Home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than these intervention services, I would like\r\n\r\nto  share  with  Members the efforts of  an  inter-agency\r\n\r\nworkgroup  -  the Golden Life Workgroup - which  aims  to\r\n\r\nraise public awareness about elderly suicide and the help\r\n\r\navailable,   and  to  equip  professionals  with   better\r\n\r\nintervention  measures to prevent such suicides.   Formed\r\n\r\nin early 2000, this workgroup is chaired by the Singapore\r\n\r\nAction Group of Elders (SAGE), with representatives  from\r\n\r\nvarious   organisations,  including  MCDS,  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nHealth,   Institute  of  Mental  Health,  Samaritans   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  National  Council  of  Social  Service,  NTUC\r\n\r\nEldercare,   hospitals,  hospices  and   family   service\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far, the workgroup has produced a training\r\n\r\nmanual for professionals, such as social workers, nurses,\r\n\r\ndoctors  and  the  police, on the management  of  elderly\r\n\r\nsuicide.   The  workgroup also conducts regular  training\r\n\r\nworkshops  for professionals and caregivers to help  them\r\n\r\nto  identify  suicidal tendencies among the  elderly  and\r\n\r\nrender  necessary assistance.  To raise public  awareness\r\n\r\non  elderly  suicide,  the workgroup  launched  a  public\r\n\r\neducation campaign in September last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry also funds Befriending Services, Day\r\n\r\nCare and Neighbourhood Link programmes which help relieve\r\n\r\nthe  social  isolation that can contribute to depression.\r\n\r\nSuch  programmes  serve  to  keep  the  elderly  actively\r\n\r\nengaged.   They also refer the elderly and their families\r\n\r\nto other appropriate services as necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS also plans to promote expertise in gero-counselling, a specialised form of counselling which is\r\n\r\nmore sensitive to the physical and psycho-social needs of\r\n\r\nthe  elderly.

The  Golden  Life  Workgroup   has\r\n\r\nproduced a training manual which will be used by all  the\r\n\r\ncaregivers to help them identify potential suicide cases.\r\n\r\nOnce  they  have been identified, they can  be  referred,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  their level, either to counselling  or  to\r\n\r\nvarious specialists at the Institute of Mental Health, to\r\n\r\nprovide  counselling and whatever curative care  that  is\r\n\r\nneeded.

We are monitoring\r\n\r\nthe  figures  very closely, and these figures  have  come\r\n\r\nfrom the Subordinate Courts.  A lot would depend upon the\r\n\r\ntraining conducted by the Golden Life Workgroup, together\r\n\r\nwith the various community service providers, in how they\r\n\r\ncan  successfully  identify  those  potential  cases  and\r\n\r\nprevent them from taking place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our basic philosophy is that if we can continue to\r\n\r\nengage  the elderly within the community, that  would  be\r\n\r\none  of  the best steps forward, as that will bring  them\r\n\r\ninto contact with community service providers through the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood links, the activity centres, which can then\r\n\r\nhelp  to  identify potential cases and  suicides  can  be\r\n\r\nprevented.

The land cost would be\r\n\r\nabout  $9,000  and the construction cost would  be  about\r\n\r\n$11,000.   In the case of surface car parks, my  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  given the figure of $11,200.  In the case of surface\r\n\r\ncar  parks, obviously the bulk of the cost would be  land\r\n\r\ncost.   There  would  still  be  some  construction  cost\r\n\r\nbecause  we need to surface the lots and do the  markings\r\n\r\nand  all  that.  There would still be some costs involved\r\n\r\nbut  obviously,  because we do  not  have  to  put  up  a\r\n\r\nfoundation  for the whole structure, the  cost  would  be\r\n\r\nlower in that respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister of State, in an\r\n\r\nearlier  answer, said that the depreciation was based  on\r\n\r\naccounting  practice, ie, the life of the car park  would\r\n\r\nlast  for  as long as the flat, ie, 99 years.   But  what\r\n\r\nwould  happen  to  the  remaining  car  park  after   the\r\n\r\ndepreciation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> I mentioned that the cost\r\n\r\nof  land  is  depreciated over 99 years and the  cost  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  is  depreciated  over  60  years.   These   are\r\n\r\naccounting  norms  based on what we think  would  be  the\r\n\r\nestimated useful life of that building or land.   In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of land, it is quite clear because the entire  land\r\n\r\nis sold on a 99-year lease.  In the case of a car park, I\r\n\r\nthink  we can argue whether it should be 60 years  or  50\r\n\r\nyears,  or so on.  But the point is this is what we  feel\r\n\r\nand  the  accountants feel is a reasonable target  to  be\r\n\r\ndepreciated  over.  I would like to caution Members  that\r\n\r\nif we were to increase the rate of depreciation, it would\r\n\r\nincrease the cost on an annual basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HDB SEASON PARKING CARD</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Introduction)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational  Development whether the HDB  will  introduce  a\r\n\r\nseason\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nparking  card that can be applicable island wide, similar\r\n\r\nto what is issued to an elected Member of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, currently,\r\n\r\nmotorists  who  wish  to park their cars  islandwide  can\r\n\r\npurchase a Monthly Parking Coupon (MPC) from URA and HDB.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of MPC:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one which costs $270.

He pointed out  that\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime Minister had not given the  impression\r\n\r\nthat the PTC would not be approving any bus fare increase\r\n\r\nthis  year.  Mr Yeo quoted what the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhad actually said in his Budget statement, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Public Transport Council (PTC) is currently\r\n\r\nevaluating  proposals  from the  transport  operators  to\r\n\r\nrevise fares.

After\r\n\r\nconsidering their views, with the likely increase in  GST\r\n\r\nto  5% and the proposed cut in the corporate income  tax,\r\n\r\nthe  PTC has decided that there is no need to raise fares\r\n\r\nnext year as a result of the GST increase.

The Sub-Committee reviewed  the\r\n\r\nexisting  CPF  framework,  and proposed  changes  to  the\r\n\r\nsystem  to  achieve  a better balance between  retirement\r\n\r\nsecurity  and  home  ownership, and to  make  the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket  more  flexible, in order to maintain  and  create\r\n\r\nmore  jobs especially for vulnerable groups such as lower\r\n\r\nincome and older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In parallel with the work of the ERC, the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  National Development has been studying how to  inject\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility into the public housing market.   In\r\n\r\nparticular,  MND  has studied devolving  to  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  those  functions of the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  (HDB)  which  extend beyond the Government's  core\r\n\r\nresponsibility of providing affordable basic housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I shall present the Government's response to\r\n\r\nthe ERC's CPF recommendations, and outline the changes to\r\n\r\nCPF rules arising from MND's review of HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Key Principles of the CPF System</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first deal with the ERC recommendations. The\r\n\r\nGovernment accepts all the ERC recommendations.  The  CPF\r\n\r\nis the cornerstone of our social security system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt  is  based  on  individual  responsibility  and  self-funding,  and has served us well for many years,  helping\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  save  for their own  retirement.   The  CPF\r\n\r\nsystem remains fundamentally sound.  However, our society\r\n\r\nis  changing.  Singaporeans are living longer.  More  are\r\n\r\nremaining single or having fewer children.  Increasingly,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have to depend more on CPF savings  than  on\r\n\r\ntheir  children for their retirement needs.  We now  must\r\n\r\nupdate  the  CPF  framework,  to  adapt  to  a  different\r\n\r\neconomic  and social environment, and to pre-empt  future\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes to the CPF system will be based on the\r\n\r\nfollowing principles adopted by the ERC:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the CPF should focus on three key objectives:\r\n\r\nretirement  expenditure, healthcare and  home  ownership.\r\n\r\nThese form the core elements of financial security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, CPF should aim to meet these three needs at\r\n\r\na  basic  level.  Beyond  this basic  level,  individuals\r\n\r\nshould   rely   on   their  own   private   savings   and\r\n\r\narrangements. For a compulsory scheme like the CPF to  go\r\n\r\nbeyond  providing for basic needs would add  rigidity  to\r\n\r\nthe economy and be onerous to both employers and workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the CPF should be designed for the broad\r\n\r\nmajority  of Singaporeans, between the 10th to  the  80th\r\n\r\npercentiles of the income spectrum.  Those below the 10th\r\n\r\npercentile  cannot rely on CPF alone for their retirement\r\n\r\nneeds,  and  would need the help of other social  support\r\n\r\nschemes.  Those above the 80th percentile should be  well\r\n\r\nable to look after their own financial affairs, including\r\n\r\nplanning for their retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, changes to the CPF system should be\r\n\r\ngradual,   because  many  people  have   made   long-term\r\n\r\ncommitments based on the current framework and they  need\r\n\r\ntime to adjust to any policy changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Minimum Sum</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1994, the Government has been progressively\r\n\r\nincreasing the Minimum Sum by $5,000 each year.  We  will\r\n\r\nreach\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  target Minimum Sum of $80,000, including up to  half\r\n\r\nin  a  property  pledge, by July 2003.  This  will  allow\r\n\r\nmembers to draw a monthly income of about $450 to support\r\n\r\na modest standard of living upon retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government agrees with the ERC that the CPF\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum should not remain frozen at $80,000.  As  the\r\n\r\neconomy grows and wages increase, Singaporeans will  have\r\n\r\nhigher  expectations of what is adequate for their  basic\r\n\r\nretirement  needs.  The current Minimum Sum will  not  be\r\n\r\nenough  and  will need to be revised upwards  over  time.\r\n\r\nThe  Government will decide on the next target amount for\r\n\r\nthe  Minimum  Sum and the schedule for reaching  the  new\r\n\r\ntarget,  after the Minimum Sum has reached  $80,000  next\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Special Account</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution rates to the Special Account are\r\n\r\ncurrently 4% for members aged 35 and below, 6% for  those\r\n\r\naged between 35-45, and also 6% for those aged between 45-55  (or,  in brief, 4-6-6).  The Government has announced\r\n\r\nthat these contribution rates will be increased to 4%, 6%\r\n\r\nand  8%  respectively  (4-6-8), as  we  restore  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate to 40%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even at 4-6-8, however, only half of all CPF members\r\n\r\ncan  achieve the Minimum Sum of $80,000 by  age  55.   To\r\n\r\nhelp  more  Singaporeans  attain  the  Minimum  Sum,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  decided to adopt the ERC's  proposal  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  target CPF contribution rates to the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  by  1  percentage point across the  various  age\r\n\r\ngroups,  from  4-6-8 to 5-7-9.  This will enable  another\r\n\r\n10%  of  CPF members to attain the Minimum Sum of $80,000\r\n\r\nby age 55.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase in the Special Account contribution\r\n\r\nrates  to 5-7-9 will be effected as we restore the  total\r\n\r\nCPF contribution rate to 40%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Investment in Private Pension Plans</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help CPF members build up more cash savings, the\r\n\r\nERC has proposed that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Government  facilitate the  provision  of  low-cost,\r\n\r\nprivately-managed pension plans to CPF members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government agrees that we should encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  invest  in  privately-managed   pension\r\n\r\nplans.  Experience in other countries, such as the US and\r\n\r\nAustralia,  has  shown that, over  the  long  term,  well\r\n\r\ndiversified  pension  plans  offer  better  returns  than\r\n\r\nkeeping the money in cash, earning short-term savings  or\r\n\r\nfixed deposit rates of interest.  Such pension plans also\r\n\r\noffer  superior returns at lower risk and cost,  compared\r\n\r\nto  members investing the money themselves in  shares  or\r\n\r\nunit trusts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, private pension plans are not yet available\r\n\r\nin  the local market.  This is partly because the current\r\n\r\nregulatory  rules for the CPF Investment  Scheme  (CPFIS)\r\n\r\nare not conducive to such plans.  More fundamentally,  it\r\n\r\nwill  take  time for Singaporeans to adopt a  mindset  of\r\n\r\ninvesting  their  retirement  savings  with  a  long-term\r\n\r\nperspective,  instead of using CPF  funds  to  trade  for\r\n\r\nshort-term gains, eg, on the stock market.  Based on  the\r\n\r\nexperience  of other countries, the process  of  changing\r\n\r\nthis   public  mindset  may  take  a  decade  or  longer.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we should start now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its part, the Government will facilitate\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  private pension plans, as  an  additional\r\n\r\noption   under  the  CPFIS  framework.   We  will  review\r\n\r\nexisting CPFIS rules to improve the viability of  pension\r\n\r\nplans,  and  encourage members to consider pension  plans\r\n\r\nseriously as an investment option.  However, CPF  members\r\n\r\nmust   remember  that  higher  risk  accompanies   higher\r\n\r\nreturns,  and  that they are ultimately  responsible  for\r\n\r\ntheir own investment decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Special Account Interest Rate</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all CPF members will be ready to enrol in\r\n\r\nprivate  pension  plans,  or  take  on  other  investment\r\n\r\noptions  already  available under the CPFIS.   Those  who\r\n\r\nprefer  to can continue to leave their savings  with  the\r\n\r\nCPF   Board.   The  Special  Account  interest  rate   is\r\n\r\ncurrently  pegged to a premium of 11/2 percentage  points\r\n\r\nover\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe Ordinary Account interest rate.  The ERC has proposed\r\n\r\npegging  the  Special Account interest  rate  to  a  more\r\n\r\nappropriate long-term interest rate, such as the yield on\r\n\r\nlong-term Government bonds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government agrees with this recommendation in\r\n\r\nprinciple.    It  will  study  the  matter  further,   to\r\n\r\ndetermine the appropriate benchmark interest rate to use,\r\n\r\nand the time of implementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Salary Cap</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also agrees with the ERC's\r\n\r\nrecommendations  to  lower the  salary  ceiling  for  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions from a monthly salary of $6,000 to $5,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in line with the principle that CPF should\r\n\r\nfocus on catering to basic needs of the population in the\r\n\r\n10th to the 80th percentiles of the income spectrum.  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  who  earn  more than $5,000 a  month  fall  well\r\n\r\nwithin the top 20th percentile in terms of income.  There\r\n\r\nis  no  need  to  require  them to  set  aside  the  same\r\n\r\nproportion of their incomes in compulsory CPF savings  as\r\n\r\nothers  with lower incomes.  Lowering the salary  ceiling\r\n\r\nfor CPF contributions to $5,000 will achieve this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service will also rationalise the salary\r\n\r\nceiling  of  the public sector with that of  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.   The salary ceilings for non-pensionable  public\r\n\r\nofficers are currently $7,000 for employer contributions,\r\n\r\nand  $6,000  for employee contributions. We  will  reduce\r\n\r\nboth ceilings to $5,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensionable public officers currently have higher\r\n\r\nCPF    salary   ceilings,   at   $9,333   for    employer\r\n\r\ncontributions, and $8,000 for employee contributions.  As\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF  contribution rates are lower  than  for  non-pensionable  officers,  their salary  ceilings  were  set\r\n\r\nhigher so that their maximum contribution in dollar terms\r\n\r\nwould  equal that of non-pensionable officers.  With  the\r\n\r\nceilings  for  non-pensionable officers brought  down  to\r\n\r\n$5,000,  we will lower both the employer's and employee's\r\n\r\nceilings for pensionable officers to $6,667.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution ceiling to the Supplementary\r\n\r\nRetirement  Scheme (SRS) will be correspondingly  reduced\r\n\r\nto $5,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason the CPF salary ceiling had been set at a\r\n\r\nhigh  level was to effectively lower the personal  income\r\n\r\ntax  burden  on higher income groups, because  compulsory\r\n\r\nCPF contributions are tax deductible.  At a time when top\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax rates were high, this was especially\r\n\r\nrelevant for employees, whose incomes tended to  be  more\r\n\r\nfully    declared   than   self-employed   workers    and\r\n\r\nprofessionals.  However, over the years we  have  lowered\r\n\r\nincome  tax  rates  significantly.   We  have  now   also\r\n\r\nimplemented the SRS scheme, which enables Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nset aside additional voluntary savings for retirement, in\r\n\r\ntax sheltered SRS accounts.  There is therefore no longer\r\n\r\na need for such a high CPF ceiling.  Singaporeans who are\r\n\r\nconcerned that the lower CPF contribution will result  in\r\n\r\nthem  paying  more income taxes, and who have  not  taken\r\n\r\nfull  advantage of the SRS scheme, may wish to do  so  to\r\n\r\nlower their tax liability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes will be implemented as we restore the\r\n\r\nCPF contribution rate to 40%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Income Floor</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, employees who earn less than $200 a month\r\n\r\ndo  not  contribute to CPF.  Contribution rates are  then\r\n\r\nphased in on a sliding scale from 5% for wages at $200 to\r\n\r\na full rate of 20% for wages at $363 and above.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This income floor of $200 was set in 1955 when CPF\r\n\r\nwas  first  introduced.  In the half century since  then,\r\n\r\nwages   have  gone  up  many  fold,  but  we   have   not\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly   adjusted   the   income   floor.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  therefore  agrees to the  ERC's  proposal  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  income floor for employee's CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nfrom between $200 and $363 to between $500 and $750.  The\r\n\r\nvast majority of workers in full-time jobs earn more than\r\n\r\n$750  per  month.   This  change will  therefore  benefit\r\n\r\nespecially  part-time  workers.  We  hope  that  it  will\r\n\r\nencourage more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  who  are  presently  not  working,  for  example,\r\n\r\nhousewives, to take up part-time work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change will take effect for salaries earned\r\n\r\nfrom 1st October 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Older Workers Aged 50-55</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the unemployment rate for older workers\r\n\r\naged  50-55  is  still  lower  at  4.6%.   However,  this\r\n\r\nsituation  is  unlikely  to  persist.   As  our   economy\r\n\r\nupgrades   and   restructures,  structural  unemployment,\r\n\r\nespecially among older workers, will increasingly  become\r\n\r\na problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a foretaste of this in the recent economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.   Older workers who were retrenched faced  much\r\n\r\ngreater  difficulty  securing re-employment  compared  to\r\n\r\nyounger workers.  A survey of workers who were retrenched\r\n\r\nin  the 4th quarter of last year found that as at the end\r\n\r\nof  March  this  year, among those aged  50-55,  the  re-employment  rate  was 41%, compared  to  an  overall  re-employment  rate of 50%.  Older workers also took  longer\r\n\r\nto  find  new  jobs.  The median duration of unemployment\r\n\r\nfor workers aged 50-55 was 21 weeks, compared to 13 weeks\r\n\r\nfor  workers across all age groups.  On top of this,  73%\r\n\r\nof  workers  between 50-55 years accepted pay  cuts  when\r\n\r\nthey were re-employed, compared to an overall average  of\r\n\r\n59%  who  accepted  pay cuts.  The pay  cuts  were  often\r\n\r\nsubstantial.   In other words, for this  group  of  older\r\n\r\nworkers, the re-employment rate was lower.  It took  them\r\n\r\nlonger to find new jobs, and when they did find new jobs,\r\n\r\nthey had to accept deeper pay cuts.  And more of them had\r\n\r\nto accept pay cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem of structural unemployment will not go\r\n\r\naway.   The  fundamental reason is that our workers  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to face strong and increasing competition  both\r\n\r\nfrom  educated workers in developed countries,  and  from\r\n\r\nthe  lower  cost workers of countries like China.   Older\r\n\r\nworkers will be most at risk, because they are on average\r\n\r\nless well educated than younger ones.  This too will be a\r\n\r\npersistent issue, because although workers aged 40-44 are\r\n\r\nbetter educated than those aged\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n50-54, workers aged 30-34 are better educated still  than\r\n\r\nthose  aged  40-44.  In 10 years' time, when the  workers\r\n\r\nwho are now in their 40s reach their 50s, they will still\r\n\r\nbe  less  well-educated than workers  who  are  10  years\r\n\r\nyounger than them, and therefore will be at greater  risk\r\n\r\nof becoming structurally unemployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our older workers are also more vulnerable because\r\n\r\nour  seniority-based pay system pushes  wages  up  beyond\r\n\r\nwhat  their  skills and productivity can  justify.   When\r\n\r\nolder  workers lose their jobs, they tend to have  higher\r\n\r\nwage expectations, which makes it more difficult for them\r\n\r\nto  find  re-employment.  The 40% CPF  contribution  rate\r\n\r\nexacerbates   these  problems,  because  it   discourages\r\n\r\nemployers  from  taking  on  older  workers,   and   also\r\n\r\ndiscourages  older workers from working for  lower  take-home pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the first problem of older workers being\r\n\r\nless  skilled,  we  must  continue  to  push  for  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading.   Last  year,  the  Government  introduced   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive set of programmes to upgrade the skills  of\r\n\r\nolder  workers.  These included enhanced support for  the\r\n\r\nSkills Redevelopment Programme (SRP), and the People-for-Job   Traineeship  Programme  (PJTP)  which  incentivises\r\n\r\nemployers to hire older workers by defraying part of  the\r\n\r\nassociated training costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These programmes were originally intended to last\r\n\r\nfor  12  months,  to  tide older workers  over  immediate\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in the economic downturn.   The  Government\r\n\r\nwill  now extend the enhanced support to the SRP, as well\r\n\r\nas the PJTP, for an additional year until November 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also improve the PJTP for older workers.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  PJTP,  workers receive wage support  for  six\r\n\r\nmonths, amounting to 50% of their wages.  For workers who\r\n\r\nare more than 50 years old, we will extend this period of\r\n\r\nwage  support to nine months, but at a lower support rate\r\n\r\nof 25% for the additional three months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the second problem of the seniority-based\r\n\r\nwage system, we need to inject greater flexibility in the\r\n\r\nwage\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsystem.   The  effort to promote flexi-wages has  yielded\r\n\r\nresults,  but  it will take many years to  complete.   We\r\n\r\nneed to complement it by lowering the burden of statutory\r\n\r\ncharges  on  wages  for this vulnerable  group  of  older\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government therefore agrees with the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the ERC to keep the  employer's  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate for workers aged 50-55 at  the  current\r\n\r\n16%.  We will also progressively lower the employee's CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate for workers aged 50-55 from 20% to 16%,\r\n\r\nas  we  restore  the CPF contribution  rate.   This  will\r\n\r\nincrease  the  take-home pay for these workers  and  help\r\n\r\nthem to meet their financial commitments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this structural change, the total CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate for workers aged 50-55 will  be  32%  - 16%  from  employers and 16% from employees.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nmeaningful  step-down from the 40% full  rate  for  those\r\n\r\naged  below 50, to 32% for those aged 50-55, to  20%  for\r\n\r\nthose  aged 55-60.  It will encourage employers  to  keep\r\n\r\ntheir older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should clarify that the non-restoration only\r\n\r\napplies to workers aged 50-55, and not to workers aged 55\r\n\r\nand  above.  Those workers above 55 will have  their  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate  restored together with  workers  aged\r\n\r\nbelow 50, to their pre-1998 levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of the total CPF contribution rate to\r\n\r\n32% for workers aged 50-55 addresses a foreseeable future\r\n\r\nproblem.  However, for workers already in this age  group\r\n\r\nwho  currently have jobs, the non-restoration of employer\r\n\r\ncontributions  may  cause them  to  lose  out,  at  least\r\n\r\nrelative  to  other workers whose employer  contributions\r\n\r\nwill be restored.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some older workers have also expressed concern that\r\n\r\nthe  non-restoration will affect their ability to service\r\n\r\ntheir  mortgages.   Younger workers  will  have  time  to\r\n\r\nadjust, and are unlikely to run into such problems by the\r\n\r\ntime they reach\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n50-55.   But  workers  now in this  age  group  may  face\r\n\r\nmortgage payment shortfalls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are valid concerns, although the difficulties\r\n\r\nare transitional ones.  We can, and we should, take steps\r\n\r\nto  buffer  their impact on workers who are currently  in\r\n\r\nthis  age group, especially as the restructuring  of  CPF\r\n\r\nrates  for  the  older workers deals with  a  medium-term\r\n\r\nrather   than   an   immediate  problem   of   structural\r\n\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help workers facing mortgage shortfalls due to\r\n\r\nthe  non-restoration, the Government will allow these CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  to continue to draw on their Special Account  to\r\n\r\npay  their  mortgages for a longer period  of  time.   We\r\n\r\nalready introduced such a scheme when we cut the CPF rate\r\n\r\nin 1998.  We will now extend its duration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recommended by the ERC, we encourage employers to\r\n\r\npass  on  part of their cost savings to deserving workers\r\n\r\nin this age group, as the CPF is restored for the others.\r\n\r\nEmployers  can  do so through the variable  component  of\r\n\r\nwages,  such  as  bonuses  or  other  variable  payments,\r\n\r\ndepending  on the circumstances of each company  and  the\r\n\r\ncontribution of each worker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service will take the lead and implement a\r\n\r\nTransitional  CPF  Top-Up  Component  (TCTC)  for   civil\r\n\r\nservants aged 50-55.  Officers, who are aged 50-55 on the\r\n\r\ndates  when the CPF is restored for others, will receive,\r\n\r\nin their TCTC, part of what they would have got had their\r\n\r\nCPF too been restored.  PSD will announce details of this\r\n\r\nscheme in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Valuation Limits on Bank Mortgages</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home ownership for Singaporeans continues to be a\r\n\r\nfundamental policy objective of the Government.  When the\r\n\r\nResidential Properties Scheme first started in 1981,  CPF\r\n\r\nwithdrawals  for private property purchases were  subject\r\n\r\nto a Valuation Limit of 80% of the value of the property.\r\n\r\nBut   over   the   years,   this  Valuation   Limit   was\r\n\r\nprogressively liberalised.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncurrent  limits  on  the  use of CPF  funds  to  purchase\r\n\r\nproperties are very lax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF withdrawals for housing can reach imprudent\r\n\r\nlevels  if  they are not appropriately capped.   This  is\r\n\r\nespecially  so  because  we  allow  CPF  savings  to   be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn  not just to pay for the property  itself,  but\r\n\r\nalso to service the interest payments on a mortgage loan,\r\n\r\nwhich  are  in  fact  not  investments,  but  a  form  of\r\n\r\nconsumption.   Furthermore,  the  property  market   goes\r\n\r\nthrough cycles.  If property prices fall, part of the CPF\r\n\r\nsavings  that members have put into the property  may  be\r\n\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF withdrawals for housing are meant as a form of\r\n\r\ninvestment.   Indeed,  for most Singaporeans,  the  house\r\n\r\nthey  live  in is their single most important investment.\r\n\r\nThe  amount of CPF committed to a house should  therefore\r\n\r\nbear  an  appropriate  relation  to  the  value  of   the\r\n\r\nproperty.     The    Government   accepts    the    ERC's\r\n\r\nrecommendation  to set a withdrawal limit  equivalent  to\r\n\r\n150%   of  the  valuation  of  the  property.   The  150%\r\n\r\nValuation Limit will take effect for options to  purchase\r\n\r\nresidential  properties which are  entered  into,  on  or\r\n\r\nafter 1st September 2002.  The limit will be brought down\r\n\r\ngradually to 120% of the value of the property, over five\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 150%, the Valuation Limit should not have\r\n\r\nsignificant  impact on most home buyers on  the  property\r\n\r\nmarket.   Even  at 120%, a typical CPF member  can  still\r\n\r\nservice  a  25-year mortgage fully with his  CPF  for  19\r\n\r\nyears.  There is thus a long lead-time for CPF members to\r\n\r\nplan  their  finances properly so that they can  continue\r\n\r\nservicing   the   mortgage  in  cash  after   their   CPF\r\n\r\nwithdrawals have reached the Valuation Limit,  or  factor\r\n\r\nin  some cash co-payment along the way and spread out the\r\n\r\nusage   of  their  CPF.   However,  by  instituting   the\r\n\r\nValuation Limit now, we establish the important principle\r\n\r\nthat  the amount of CPF used to buy a house must  not  be\r\n\r\nexcessive in relation to its value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Valuation Limit will not apply to those who\r\n\r\npurchase HDB flats using subsidised mortgages.   It  will\r\n\r\nalso not apply to options to purchase entered into\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbefore  1st  September 2002 and existing mortgage  loans,\r\n\r\nexcept where these are refinanced.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other ERC Recommendations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has made other recommendations which I have\r\n\r\nnot  covered today.  These include exploring ways to help\r\n\r\nhome-owners    monetise   their   assets,   strengthening\r\n\r\nprovisions for healthcare needs, and devolving  CPF-based\r\n\r\ninsurance  schemes to the private sector.  The Government\r\n\r\nagrees  with  these  recommendations in  principle.   The\r\n\r\nrelevant  agencies are studying them further to  see  how\r\n\r\nbest to implement them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Banks Origination of Market Rate HDB Loans</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now explain the changes\r\n\r\narising  from  MND's study to devolve some  non-core  HDB\r\n\r\nfunctions   to   the  private  sector.    These   include\r\n\r\ntransferring  future  HDB market  rate  loans  to  banks,\r\n\r\nchanges to the CPF charge on a private property which  is\r\n\r\nmortgaged,   and   changes  to   the   cash   downpayment\r\n\r\nrequirement on mortgages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the banks origination of market rate HDB\r\n\r\nloans.   The  Government has a responsibility to  provide\r\n\r\naffordable  basic housing in the form of  subsidised  HDB\r\n\r\nflats to Singaporeans, and to enable as many citizens  as\r\n\r\npossible to own their own homes.  It also helps HDB  home\r\n\r\nowners to upgrade to bigger flats, as their families grow\r\n\r\nand   they  accumulate  sufficient  savings.   HDB   will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to provide subsidised mortgage loans for  first\r\n\r\ntime flat buyers and second time buyers who are upgrading\r\n\r\nfrom smaller flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not all Singaporeans who buy HDB flats fall\r\n\r\ninto  these categories.  For example, they may be  buying\r\n\r\nan  HDB  flat for a third time, or they may be  making  a\r\n\r\nlateral  transfer from one 4-room flat to another.   Some\r\n\r\nmay  even  own private properties and may be  buying  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  to  live  in  while they rent  out  their  private\r\n\r\nproperties.  Other HDB buyers do not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nqualify for HDB subsidies at all.  For example, they  may\r\n\r\nbe  permanent esidents, or they may have high incomes and\r\n\r\nbe  buying a flat on the resale market.  HDB allows  such\r\n\r\npurchases,  but  it  does not consider  them  as  falling\r\n\r\nwithin  its  core objective of promoting  universal  home\r\n\r\nownership amongst Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of this distinction, HDB makes two\r\n\r\ntypes  of  loans  to the two groups of buyers.   For  the\r\n\r\nfirst  group, HDB has subsidised loans which  are  a  key\r\n\r\ninstrument to promote home ownership.  The interest  rate\r\n\r\nfor  such  loans is pegged at the CPF interest rate  plus\r\n\r\n0.1%.   For the second group, who do not fall within  the\r\n\r\nbasic housing safety net, HDB provides market rate loans.\r\n\r\nThe  interest  rate  is pegged to the  rate  DBS  charges\r\n\r\nformer Credit POSB mortgagors.  In 2001, about 37% of all\r\n\r\nloans  provided by HDB, amounting to $3.2  billion,  were\r\n\r\nmarket rate loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has been looking into whether certain functions\r\n\r\nthat  go beyond its core activities can be better handled\r\n\r\nby the private sector, so that it can better focus on its\r\n\r\nbasic  objective  of  providing  affordable  housing  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Arising from this review, the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  decided that, from 1st January 2003, HDB will  cease\r\n\r\nto  grant  market  rate  loans.  Instead  banks  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  provide loans to flat buyers  at  commercial\r\n\r\nrates  and  on  commercial terms.  HDB flat  buyers  will\r\n\r\nbenefit from more choices, and can take advantage of  the\r\n\r\nmany  competitive housing loan packages  offered  by  the\r\n\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing HDB market rate mortgagors can continue\r\n\r\ntheir  existing mortgages provided by HDB.   However,  if\r\n\r\nthey  wish  to  refinance their  loans  with  the  banks,\r\n\r\nsubject to the new Valuation Limit, they can do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>CPF Second Charge on Bank Loans</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the CPF second charge on bank loans.\r\n\r\nCurrently, for mortgage loans made by HDB, HDB has  first\r\n\r\ncharge, followed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby  CPF Board, which has second charge.  This means  that\r\n\r\nif   the   buyer  defaults  on  his  mortgage,  and   HDB\r\n\r\nrepossesses his property, then HDB will deduct the amount\r\n\r\nthat  the  mortgagor owes HDB before paying  any  balance\r\n\r\nback  to the mortgagor's CPF account, or to the mortgagor\r\n\r\nhimself in cash.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no change to this arrangement when\r\n\r\nbanks  start selling mortgages for HDB flats, as  far  as\r\n\r\nthe mortgagors are concerned.  The banks will merely step\r\n\r\ninto  the  shoes  of HDB, and have first  charge  on  the\r\n\r\nmortgage loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For mortgages on private properties, however, where\r\n\r\nthe banks have been the lenders, the arrangement has thus\r\n\r\nfar  been  the opposite.  In the event of a loan default,\r\n\r\nthe  CPF Board assumes priority charge over the mortgaged\r\n\r\nproperty,  ahead of the banks.  This means that,  in  the\r\n\r\nevent  of borrower default, the banks are unable to  make\r\n\r\neffective use of the mortgaged property to mitigate their\r\n\r\nlosses.  This is because proceeds from the liquidation of\r\n\r\nthe  property will first have to be used to repay the CPF\r\n\r\nBoard, ie, to repay the borrower's own CPF account.   And\r\n\r\nas  the loan matures and more of it is repaid through CPF\r\n\r\nwithdrawals, the Board's claims increase correspondingly.\r\n\r\nThe  banks are entitled to a diminishing residual  amount\r\n\r\nafter  the  money  has been returned to the  buyers'  CPF\r\n\r\naccount.   Hence, the more loan is repaid with  CPF,  the\r\n\r\nless satisfactory the bank's collateral position becomes.\r\n\r\nThis is not sound for the banking system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far this has not posed any major problems,\r\n\r\nbecause  over the past decades, the property  market  has\r\n\r\nrisen  steadily and strongly, especially in the  80s  and\r\n\r\nearly  90s  when  the economy was booming.   So  long  as\r\n\r\nproperty values continued to appreciate and few borrowers\r\n\r\ndefaulted  on  their mortgages, there  was  less  concern\r\n\r\nabout  the value of the collateral, and whether banks  or\r\n\r\nthe CPF ranked first in a default.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, the property market is unlikely to be\r\n\r\nas buoyant as in the 80s\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  early  90s.   This  sharpens  the  latent  prudential\r\n\r\nconcerns over the existing charge arrangement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second problem with the current arrangement is\r\n\r\nthat  borrowers  who run into difficulty will  have  less\r\n\r\nincentive to continue servicing their loans because their\r\n\r\nown  CPF  money will be less at risk than their  creditor\r\n\r\nbanks'  claim on the property.  This can also  contribute\r\n\r\nto  imprudent  investments in  properties.   CPF  members\r\n\r\ninvesting  in  shares or other financial assets  have  no\r\n\r\nsuch  buffer  available, and take on the  full  risks  of\r\n\r\ntheir investment decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not prudent to allow the present\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory arrangements to continue.  The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  thus decided to reverse the charge position  of  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard   and  banks  for  mortgage  loans  originated   by\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions regulated  by  MAS.   The  banks'\r\n\r\nprincipal will now rank ahead of CPF savings withdrawn to\r\n\r\npurchase  the  property  and to  service  the  loan.   On\r\n\r\ninterest  due,  CPF Board and the banks  will  rank  pari\r\n\r\npassu.   This change will align the treatment for private\r\n\r\nloans   with  HDB  loans.   It  will  apply  to  property\r\n\r\npurchases where the options to purchase are entered  into\r\n\r\non  or  after 1st September 2002, and also apply  to  all\r\n\r\nexisting loans that are refinanced after this date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reversal of charge position will also apply to\r\n\r\nthe   use  of  CPF  savings  for  the  purchase  of  non-residential    properties   under   the   Non-Residential\r\n\r\nProperties Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>10% Cash Downpayment on Housing Loans</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, bank financing for private property is\r\n\r\nsubject  to  a  cap  of 80% of the property  value.   The\r\n\r\nremaining 20% downpayment must be paid in cash and serves\r\n\r\nas  a buffer for the banks.  CPF money cannot be used for\r\n\r\nthis  downpayment, because the CPF Board ranks  ahead  of\r\n\r\nthe  bank  in its claim, and so, in a default, CPF  money\r\n\r\ndoes not provide any buffer to the bank.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the lending bank will rank ahead of the CPF\r\n\r\nBoard,  CPF  can  be  used for part of  the  downpayment.\r\n\r\nHowever, it would not be prudent to do away with the cash\r\n\r\nrequirement  altogether,  because  this  could  encourage\r\n\r\nexcessive property speculation.  We have thus decided  to\r\n\r\nallow   10%  of  the  downpayment  for  private  property\r\n\r\npurchase  to  be paid out of CPF savings.  The  remaining\r\n\r\n10%  will  still  have to be paid in cash.   The  maximum\r\n\r\nquantum  of  bank financing will stay at 80% of  property\r\n\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rules will apply to CPF Board applications\r\n\r\nfor  private  property  purchases where  the  options  to\r\n\r\npurchase  were  entered into, on or after  1st  September\r\n\r\n2002.   Properties  for  which the  options  were  signed\r\n\r\nbefore 1st September 2002 will not be affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB loans, whether subsidised or not, currently have\r\n\r\nno  cash  downpayment requirement.  HDB flat  buyers  are\r\n\r\nallowed   to  use  CPF  savings  to  pay  the  full   20%\r\n\r\ndownpayment,  because  for HDB loans,  CPF's  claim  rank\r\n\r\nsecond  to  HDB's claim.  When market rate HDB loans  are\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  bank  origination,  we  will   initially\r\n\r\npreserve this arrangement.  But for the longer term,  the\r\n\r\nrules  for  these bank-originated mortgages on HDB  flats\r\n\r\nshould  be  aligned with the rules for  private  property\r\n\r\nmortgages.   We  will phase in the 10%  cash  downpayment\r\n\r\nrequirement  for  bank mortgages on HDB flats  gradually,\r\n\r\nover five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>No Change to Subsidised HDB Loans</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, no change to subsidised HDB loans. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to emphasise that HDB subsidised loans will not  be\r\n\r\naffected  in  any  way by these changes.   They  will  be\r\n\r\nsubject  neither  to  the  new Valuation  Limit  for  CPF\r\n\r\nwithdrawal, nor the 10% cash downpayment requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Clerk to\r\n\r\ndistribute  a summary of the changes to Members  so  that\r\n\r\nthey could see at a glance the whole picture.  [Copies of\r\n\r\nSummary of the changes distributed to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, implementation of many of these\r\n\r\nmeasures  is  pegged  to  the  restoration  of  the   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate to 40%.  When and how long  this  will\r\n\r\ntake  depends on the state of our economy, as well as  on\r\n\r\ndevelopments in the region and around the world.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore   difficult  to  commit  to  a   schedule   for\r\n\r\nrestoration, though it remains the Government's intention\r\n\r\nto  restore  the  rate as quickly as  conditions  permit.\r\n\r\nBarring   unforeseen  circumstances,  we  can  reasonably\r\n\r\nexpect to restore CPF contribution fully to 40% in two to\r\n\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, his\r\n\r\nERC  Sub-committee members and the members of the CPF and\r\n\r\nWages Working Group for their hard work in coming up with\r\n\r\nthe CPF proposals.  During their deliberations, they have\r\n\r\nsolicited  a  wide range of views - from workers,  labour\r\n\r\nunions, employers and financial institutions.  They  have\r\n\r\nproduced  a balanced package of proposals which preserves\r\n\r\nthe existing strengths of the CPF system and, at the same\r\n\r\ntime,  makes  the necessary adjustments  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  security  of individual Singaporeans,  and  to\r\n\r\nenhance   labour  market  flexibility.   These   changes,\r\n\r\ntogether  with the changes to the use of CPF for property\r\n\r\npurchases and the divestment of HDB market rate loans  to\r\n\r\nbanks, will pre-empt significant long-term problems,  and\r\n\r\ncontribute to Singapore's overall economic resilience and\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand\r\n\r\nthat  some Members would like to debate my Statement  and\r\n\r\nin accordance with Standing Order No. 42, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nCPF changes by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nERC  is  arguably  a  set  of recommendations  that  most\r\n\r\nsignificantly affect Singaporeans.  This is evidently  so\r\n\r\nas  there  are 2.9 million CPF members with  balances  of\r\n\r\nalmost  $94 billion with the Board.  Changes to  the  CPF\r\n\r\nwill fundamentally influence the way we save and the  way\r\n\r\nwe invest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a labour MP, the most common reaction I have come\r\n\r\nacross in the last one week is why did the Government cut\r\n\r\nthe   CPF   for  older  workers.   Will  the  lower   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  for  workers aged  50-55,  amounting  to  a\r\n\r\nsaving for employers, make much of a difference in making\r\n\r\nthese workers employable?  I can understand their views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF is not a magic potion, or as in the Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying, \"wan ling dan\" that \"yao dao bing chu\".  Perhaps,\r\n\r\nthis is a key problem of the image of the CPF system.  It\r\n\r\nhas  been so successful in the past and it covers so many\r\n\r\nareas  that  people have come to regard it  as  something\r\n\r\nthat  can fix all problems straightaway.  Not so in  this\r\n\r\ncase.  Lowering the older workers' CPF contribution alone\r\n\r\ndoes not automatically make them employable.  However, we\r\n\r\nbelieve  it  will certainly make it more  attractive  for\r\n\r\nemployers to retain and hire them.  We have to view  this\r\n\r\nfrom  a  broader  perspective.  It is part  of  the  many\r\n\r\nschemes  that the Government is putting in place to  help\r\n\r\nolder workers stay employable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the proposed CPF adjustments, there are many\r\n\r\nschemes  to  help  enhance  the  employability  of  older\r\n\r\nworkers.  For example, older workers get higher levels of\r\n\r\nfunding support under the Skills Redevelopment Programme.\r\n\r\nI  am  happy  that  DPM has announced the  People-for-Job\r\n\r\nTraineeship   Programme  launched  by  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nManpower last year will be extended for one more year  to\r\n\r\nhelp older workers and workers above 40 years old to make\r\n\r\ncareer transitions by providing wage support.  I am  also\r\n\r\nvery happy that the Government is now also extending this\r\n\r\nsupport  from six months to nine months for  workers  who\r\n\r\nare aged 50 and above.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in some respects, we should look at the CPF\r\n\r\nchanges  as  a  catalyst as we restructure the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy.  The key task of the ERC must not be lost in our\r\n\r\ndebate.   The  CPF  recommendations  cannot  be  seen  in\r\n\r\nisolation.  In my view, the CPF changes will spur greater\r\n\r\nlabour  market  reforms  and increase  wage  flexibility.\r\n\r\nThese will make Singapore more attractive for investment.\r\n\r\nThus, more jobs can then be created.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I strongly urge employers not to treat the CPF\r\n\r\nchanges as just a wage cut or cost-saving exercise.  They\r\n\r\ncannot  and must not implement the changes in  a  blanket\r\n\r\nmanner.   I  am glad that the Government, as an employer,\r\n\r\nhas  decided  to  take the lead.  For  deserving  workers\r\n\r\nabove 50 years old who face the CPF cut, employers in the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector can also plough back the CPF  savings  in\r\n\r\nmonthly variable components (MVC) or bonus (AVC).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the ERC proposed that the monthly\r\n\r\nincome floor range for employees' CPF contributions  also\r\n\r\nbe  raised, from the current range of $200-$363 to  $500-$750.   This  increases  the take-home  pay  for  workers\r\n\r\nearning below $750.  This will help them better meet  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  needs  and encourage more to take  up  part-time\r\n\r\njobs,  and  also encourage workers to enter the workforce\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, part-time workers are a group that deserves\r\n\r\nmore   attention  and  help.   We  know  that   employers\r\n\r\ngenerally do not provide benefits for part-time  workers.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  they  do  not get much  medical  or  leave\r\n\r\nbenefits.  This should not be the case.  Employers should\r\n\r\nseriously  consider to pro-rate the benefits  to  further\r\n\r\nattract more people to take up part-time jobs with  these\r\n\r\nCPF changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the ERC recommendations, I hope the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  consider doing more to  help  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  workers,  as they work hard  to  earn  an  honest\r\n\r\nliving  and  more  can be done to help  them.   When  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  implements  CPF top-ups  or  distributes  New\r\n\r\nSingapore  Shares  in  future, the older  and  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome workers must take top priority.  This will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmake  up  for the reductions in their CPF as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe ERC recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am encouraged that the ERC\r\n\r\nstudied  the  issues thoroughly in its report.   The  key\r\n\r\nrecommendations go some way in enhancing the CPF members'\r\n\r\nretirement  savings, especially with the 1%  increase  to\r\n\r\nthe  Special Account.  The cap on housing loans will also\r\n\r\npreserve more CPF savings for members, as otherwise  they\r\n\r\nmay be eroded through housing loan interest payments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the ERC has recommended that the\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum be raised beyond $80,000, it did not say what\r\n\r\nthe new target should be, when it should be achieved,  or\r\n\r\nwhat provisions should be put in place to ensure that  it\r\n\r\nis  met.  We all know that the Minimum Sum is not enough.\r\n\r\nBut  what  exactly  will  be  enough?   We  need  to  let\r\n\r\nSingaporeans know so that they can work towards it.   The\r\n\r\nERC could have been clearer in this respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Committee of Supply debate, I asked the\r\n\r\nMinister for Manpower how was the Minimum Sum derived and\r\n\r\nwhether it was enough.  In reply, the Minister said  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minimum Sum is literally the bare minimum.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhope the Government can give a clearer indication of what\r\n\r\nthe  new  target  should be when  it  considers  the  CPF\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask is whether we\r\n\r\nshould   also   set  regular  adjustments   to   Medisave\r\n\r\ncontributions, like the Minimum Sum, to be raised further\r\n\r\nin  future.  Many workers do worry that their Medisave is\r\n\r\nnot  enough.  Let me share a feedback I received  from  a\r\n\r\nunion leader.  She told me:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is timely to refocus CPF and bring the focus\r\n\r\nback  to retirement savings and medical.  My parents  had\r\n\r\nvery  little  in  their  Medisave  and,  when  they  were\r\n\r\nhospitalised in recent years, they had to draw on all the\r\n\r\nchildren's Medisave.  Fortunately, there were four of  us\r\n\r\nfor  them to draw on.  A relative of mine had all his CPF\r\n\r\nMedisave savings wiped out over a few years when his  dad\r\n\r\nsuffered  from cancer.  The old man had minimum  Medisave\r\n\r\nand he has only one child.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we need to also ensure that people have\r\n\r\nenough savings for their medical needs in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I support the changes, but I\r\n\r\nurge  the Government to continue to explore more ways  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  older and lower income workers  who  will  see\r\n\r\nreductions  in  their CPF accounts.  How will  they  meet\r\n\r\ntheir retirement needs?  What is the level of CPF Minimum\r\n\r\nSum which is adequate for their retirement?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, employers too must do more. They cannot let\r\n\r\nthe  Government  just carry the can.  They  can  actually\r\n\r\nplay  a  much  more  constructive role in  helping  their\r\n\r\nemployees  adjust  to the changes, particularly  for  the\r\n\r\nolder workers.  To the employer, I would like to say:  do\r\n\r\nnot  discriminate against older workers but  continue  to\r\n\r\nreward them fairly for their contributions.  Redesign the\r\n\r\njobs  to increase productivity and employability  of  the\r\n\r\nolder workers and attract part-timers.  At the end of the\r\n\r\nday,  CPF  changes  will introduce wage flexibility  that\r\n\r\nwill make companies more competitive.  With the employers\r\n\r\ntaking a more active role, this would mean more jobs  for\r\n\r\nworkers, together with all the changes recommended.  Only\r\n\r\nin  this  way can we achieve a win-win outcome  for  both\r\n\r\nemployers and employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support\r\n\r\nof  the  CPF  changes  as proposed by  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the changes to the CPF system are gradual,\r\n\r\nit  is  a  step  in  the  right  direction  in  preparing\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   for   the  future.   Faced   with   global\r\n\r\ncompetition and an aging society, Singaporeans must adopt\r\n\r\nmore prudent and longer term financial planning for their\r\n\r\npresent and retirement needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF system has benefited many Singaporeans over\r\n\r\nthe years.  It has helped many Singaporeans to own homes,\r\n\r\npay part of their medical expenses, and also to have some\r\n\r\ncash savings for retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With medical advancements and better healthcare, the\r\n\r\nlife  span  of Singaporeans will increase, thus requiring\r\n\r\nmore Singaporeans to plan for a longer retirement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperiod.  This, coupled with the increasing health  costs,\r\n\r\nwill  pose an undue financial burden on retirees, if they\r\n\r\ndo   not   have   sufficient  savings  after  retirement.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it is necessary for us to fine-tune  our  CPF\r\n\r\nsystem  to  help  Singaporeans  better  cope  with  these\r\n\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to highlight the impact of the proposed\r\n\r\nchanges  on  CPF  members,  employers  and  the  property\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Impact on CPF members</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed increase of CPF contribution rate to\r\n\r\nthe   Special  Account  and  the  lowering  of  the   CPF\r\n\r\nwithdrawal limit for housing will ensure adequacy of  CPF\r\n\r\nfunds   for   retirement  needs.   These  measures   will\r\n\r\nencourage  CPF members to be more prudent when purchasing\r\n\r\nproperty  not using HDB subsidised loans.  It  will  also\r\n\r\nindirectly   provide  some  barriers  for  existing   HDB\r\n\r\nhomeowners  to upgrade into private property.   As  such,\r\n\r\nfuture   Singapore   generations   may   encounter   some\r\n\r\ndifficulty to own private homes.  But these measures  are\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  address the \"asset  rich  and  cash  poor\"\r\n\r\nsituation faced by some retirees today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed increase in the contribution rate to\r\n\r\nMedisave  and  the  devolution of MediShield  to  private\r\n\r\ninsurers  will  also  increase the affordability  of  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers on their healthcare expenses in future.   But  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  be cautious in adopting a healthcare  insurance\r\n\r\napproach,  as many countries have experienced  abuses  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  system resulting in drastic increases in  health\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Impact on employers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes have minimum impact in helping\r\n\r\nto  reduce  business costs in Singapore.  A 4% saving  in\r\n\r\nemployers' CPF contribution for employees aged between 50\r\n\r\nand  55  years  old will not provide much  incentive  for\r\n\r\nemployers  to employ these workers.  Instead, this  group\r\n\r\nof workers will lose out 4% of their CPF savings for five\r\n\r\nyears.  I do not think employers will modify their salary\r\n\r\nsystem to specifically provide variable wage\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncomponent  for  these workers.  In fact,  many  of  these\r\n\r\nolder  workers may not be in a position to  bargain  with\r\n\r\ntheir  employers,  thus  literally  losing  4%  of  their\r\n\r\nsalary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Government to allow\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to  adopt market practices  to  reward  their\r\n\r\nworkers aged between 50 and 55.  These workers should  be\r\n\r\nrewarded based on their work performance.  We should  not\r\n\r\ncap  their  CPF  contributions  and  cause  the  existing\r\n\r\n110,000  workers in this age group to suffer a  pay  cut.\r\n\r\nWe   should  instead  make  workers  and  employers  both\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  they have to give and take,  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  their companies can survive and continue to provide\r\n\r\nemployment.  The CPF contribution should not be used as a\r\n\r\ntool to save jobs or reduce business cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help older workers to remain employable, we\r\n\r\nshould continue to encourage skills upgrading and provide\r\n\r\nincentives for companies to employ older workers, such as\r\n\r\nproviding tax rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Impact on property market</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed 150% limit on CPF withdrawal for\r\n\r\nhousing  will not have significant impact on the property\r\n\r\nmarket,  except  for  HDB upgraders.   The  reduction  of\r\n\r\nsalary ceiling for CPF contribution from $6,000 to $5,000\r\n\r\nwill  affect  the mortgage payment plan for home  buyers,\r\n\r\nespecially dual income HDB families which plan to upgrade\r\n\r\nto  private property.  The 150% CPF withdrawal limit will\r\n\r\nalso  curb  demand for private housing as these potential\r\n\r\nhome  buyers are usually in their 40s and 50s,  and  will\r\n\r\nnot  be able to secure a 25-year bank loan.  It will also\r\n\r\naffect  the  repayment  ability of  home  buyers  in  the\r\n\r\ndistant future, especially when interest rate increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in the longer term, the proposed CPF changes\r\n\r\nwill  lower  the attractiveness of property as  an  asset\r\n\r\nclass  for  investors.   This  will  provide  more  price\r\n\r\nstability  in the property market, thus avoiding  drastic\r\n\r\nproperty  price  fluctuations,  which  have  caused  some\r\n\r\nbankruptcies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed CPF changes will provide a more\r\n\r\nbalanced  portfolio  for CPF members  to  better  prepare\r\n\r\nthemselves for their future needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the CPF changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Sir, I am assured  that  the  changes\r\n\r\nwill  be introduced at a gradual pace and this would give\r\n\r\nsufficient  time  to the members to make adjustments  and\r\n\r\nadapt to the new system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the change to raise the monthly salary floor\r\n\r\nrange  for employees' contribution to $500-$750 from  the\r\n\r\ncurrent range of $200-$363, I believe this will encourage\r\n\r\nmore  job-seekers  to consider jobs, including  part-time\r\n\r\nwork, as this will enable them to bring home more pay  to\r\n\r\nmeet  their  immediate  needs.  However,  there  is  this\r\n\r\nconcern  that  with this change, low-income workers  will\r\n\r\nnot be able to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsave  more for their Medisave and retirement needs.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  hope  that  the  Government will,  in  times  of  good\r\n\r\nbudgetary  surpluses, help to provide more to this  group\r\n\r\nof  workers so that they can have more savings  in  their\r\n\r\nCPF, eg, the CPF Top-up scheme or Medisave scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the same time, we should also help these\r\n\r\nworkers to upgrade their skills so that they can move  on\r\n\r\nto  better  paying jobs and make better contributions  to\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF.   As regards the lower employer  contribution\r\n\r\nrate for workers aged 50 to 55, from 20% to 16% when  the\r\n\r\nCPF contribution rate is restored to 40%, I would like to\r\n\r\nurge  employers  to  follow the Government's  example  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a CPF Top-Up which can form part of the  monthly\r\n\r\nvariable component.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next, to help members to enhance their return\r\n\r\non their CPF balances, I am happy to hear of the proposal\r\n\r\nto  increase  the  interest paid to the  Special  Account\r\n\r\nbalances.  This is to be based on more appropriate  long-term interest rates like the interest rates of Government\r\n\r\nbonds  and  also  to make a change to the CPF  Investment\r\n\r\nScheme  to  enable  members to  participate  in  low-cost\r\n\r\nprivately  managed  pension  funds.   Sir,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nencourage  members  to make use of  these  facilities,  a\r\n\r\npublic education programme is necessary.  I would like to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  CPF  embark on an education  programme  to\r\n\r\neducate members on the pension scheme, explaining clearly\r\n\r\nthe downside risks as well as the benefits of the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERC has stated its concern that the present\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum  Scheme  will  not  be  sufficient  for  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of retirees and, therefore, we need to increase\r\n\r\nit  beyond the current target of $80,000.  I support this\r\n\r\nproposal  to  increase  the  Minimum  Sum  Scheme  beyond\r\n\r\n$80,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the DPM whether there is any way\r\n\r\nwhereby we can incorporate the Minimum Sum Scheme  within\r\n\r\nthe proposed pension plan scheme for CPF members.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for housing needs, the liberal usage of the\r\n\r\nCPF  funds over the years has unfortunately led  to  many\r\n\r\nCPF  members  becoming  \"asset-rich  and  cash  poor\"  at\r\n\r\nretirement.   Housing ownership has  contributed  to  our\r\n\r\nstability  as  it  has  given our  citizens  a  stake  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's  success.  But I think there is this  problem\r\n\r\nthat  the  property that they purchased cannot be  easily\r\n\r\nconverted  into  cash, particularly in a period  of  slow\r\n\r\nproperty  market  and  this has  prevented  members  from\r\n\r\nconverting their properties into cash when they need it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to explore means to enable house owners\r\n\r\nto monetise their properties.  I understand that the Land\r\n\r\nWorking  Group of the Sub-committee is looking into  some\r\n\r\nrecommendations.   I would like to see  what  they  would\r\n\r\nrecommend because I think there is an urgent need to help\r\n\r\nthose who have put money into properties to convert  them\r\n\r\ninto cash.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  wish  to join in the debate on this  Ministerial\r\n\r\nStatement on the CPF and related changes, so as  to  seek\r\n\r\nsome  clarifications  and  ask  for  flexibility  on  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the proposed CPF changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I start, I wish to declare my interest that I\r\n\r\nam  an Executive Director in an organisation involved  in\r\n\r\nproperty  business and I personally am a property  owner.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, I am going to reach 50 years very soon and will\r\n\r\nbe  much  affected  by the new CPF changes.   Hence,  the\r\n\r\nchanges I request for will have an impact on the property\r\n\r\nmarket.   However, the points I intend to raise  are  for\r\n\r\nthe general interest of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to support the various changes announced\r\n\r\nby  the  Deputy  Prime Minister.  The  DPM  has  actually\r\n\r\nannounced  many  changes and some are most  welcome.   In\r\n\r\nparticular, I would like to express my happiness  in  the\r\n\r\nnew   rule  to  allow  10%  of  the  purchase  price  for\r\n\r\ndownpayment to be paid out of the CPF account.   This  is\r\n\r\nindeed a welcome move to enable younger employees to  buy\r\n\r\ntheir first property.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand and accept the proposed changes to\r\n\r\nthe CPF regime such that there will be less risk of over-exposure  of the people, especially for older people,  to\r\n\r\nproperty  investments.  However, there are some  concerns\r\n\r\nof  the public on the lowering of the salary ceiling from\r\n\r\n$6,000 to $5,000 and that these new rules will lessen the\r\n\r\nability of the affected persons to service their existing\r\n\r\nhousing loans using CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise four suggestions or\r\n\r\nquestions with the DPM.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I wish to make is that the proposed\r\n\r\ncapping  of the total amount that can be used  from  CPF,\r\n\r\nfrom  160% to 150% in the first year, and eventually down\r\n\r\nto  120%  of the property value in the fifth year,  means\r\n\r\nthat  employees  who have loans reaching this  limit  but\r\n\r\nthey  could  have  some more balance  in  their  own  CPF\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Account,  are  forced  to  use  their  personal\r\n\r\nsavings  or  cash to continue servicing existing  housing\r\n\r\nloans.  This may pose, in some cases, severe financial or\r\n\r\ncash  flow  problems  to  these  affected  persons.    In\r\n\r\naddition,  in terms of investment options open  to  them,\r\n\r\nthis  new  rule  will  mean that they  now  have  limited\r\n\r\noptions that can be used in the CPF funds for properties,\r\n\r\nand  may  have to switch to investing in other  forms  of\r\n\r\ninvestments, like shares, securities, and other forms  of\r\n\r\nfinancial instruments.  This could create rigidity in the\r\n\r\ninvestment  options open to them.  We  have  read  recent\r\n\r\nreports from banks and financial advisers that properties\r\n\r\nhave  historically been proven to be  a  better  form  of\r\n\r\ninvestment  compared to shares and  equities.   This  new\r\n\r\nrule  may  impose  more constraints on  the  CPF  account\r\n\r\nholders to put their money into good investments such  as\r\n\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is to request the DPM to\r\n\r\nconsider  allowing loans for one owner-occupied  property\r\n\r\nper  person to be exempted from the total valuation  cap.\r\n\r\nThe  limit is 150%, reducing to 120% in five years' time,\r\n\r\nwhich  would be imposed on CPF withdrawals to be used  to\r\n\r\nservice such loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concept is practicable and workable, which is\r\n\r\nthe same principle applied\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the  case of property tax concession where  a  person\r\n\r\nwith  one  owner-occupied property is  allowed  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nproperty  tax  concession.  I believe this suggestion  or\r\n\r\nflexibility  of  not  imposing a valuation  cap  will  be\r\n\r\nbeneficial to all Singaporeans, and lessen their concerns\r\n\r\nabout  their  ability  to service existing  or  even  new\r\n\r\nhousing  loans, provided it is a owner-occupied property.\r\n\r\nI  sincerely feel that this suggestion is very useful and\r\n\r\nmeaningful, and urge the DPM to think about it seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to turn to two\r\n\r\nquestions  that I have filed for Oral Answer.   If  these\r\n\r\ntwo questions are adequately addressed and replied to  by\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime  Minister, I may consider  withdrawing\r\n\r\nthese two questions to be tabled for a future sitting  of\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first suggestion is not to lower the CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates of older workers aged  between  50-55\r\n\r\nwho  have  existing housing loans.  I  wish  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister to consider this idea, because  the\r\n\r\nolder  workers  aged  between 50-55  may  be  faced  with\r\n\r\nheavier reliance on their cash or personal finances  when\r\n\r\ntheir CPF contribution rates are reduced or not restored.\r\n\r\nThis  concession  will also mitigate  their  concerns  of\r\n\r\ntheir ability to continue servicing their existing loans.\r\n\r\nIf  their  CPF  contribution rates are  lower  (as  their\r\n\r\nemployer's  contribution will be lower),  therefore  they\r\n\r\ncannot service their loans based on the present plans for\r\n\r\ntheir existing loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I particularly like the idea of the\r\n\r\nTransitional CPF Component Top-up (TCTC) which  has  been\r\n\r\nproposed for civil servants aged between 50-55.  I  think\r\n\r\nthis idea is a very enlightened and laudable move.  May I\r\n\r\nurge  the  Government  to request private  companies  and\r\n\r\nemployers who are doing well to consider having a similar\r\n\r\nscheme  for  their employees aged between  50-55.   Their\r\n\r\nworkers  will at least enjoy the benefit of the CPF  top-up, for companies that are doing well, and not face lower\r\n\r\nCPF contributions into their accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last suggestion is to request the DPM to\r\n\r\nconsider not applying the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproposed  CPF  changes to owners of  existing  properties\r\n\r\nwhen they re-finance loans on their properties.  A person\r\n\r\nmay  continue  to own an existing property  but  wish  to\r\n\r\nrefinance the terms of the loan with the existing bankers\r\n\r\nor  new  bankers,  so  as  to enjoy  the  declining  loan\r\n\r\ninterest  rates.   If  the new  rules  kick  in  when  an\r\n\r\nexisting property is refinanced, then the owners may find\r\n\r\nthat   they   are   restricted  from   using   more   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  once  the  limit  on  the  withdrawals  is\r\n\r\nreached based on the new rules.  This may result  in  the\r\n\r\nowners  being  unable to enjoy lower  interest  rates  if\r\n\r\ntheir banks are imposing higher interest rates than other\r\n\r\nbankers.   I am sure that DPM does not wish to  see  this\r\n\r\nrigidity that creates a constraint on our people to enjoy\r\n\r\nlower housing loan rates, particularly for refinancing of\r\n\r\nexisting  properties.  Therefore, refinancing of existing\r\n\r\nproperties should not be deemed as new loans when the new\r\n\r\nCPF  rules  are  applicable.  If this is not  allowed,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the DPM to explain to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the proposed CPF changes may be\r\n\r\nreceived favourably by the Government for the benefit  of\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting\r\n\r\nfrom the provisions of Standing Order No. 1.  -  [Mr Mah\r\n\r\nBow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND AND RELATED CHANGES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to express my appreciation to members of  the\r\n\r\nERC  Sub-Committee for their recommendations on the  CPF.\r\n\r\nI  support  the recommendations and would like  to  offer\r\n\r\nsome  suggestions  on the greater use of  private  sector\r\n\r\npension scheme as an extended form of the CPF scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since its introduction in the 50s, there have\r\n\r\nbeen many refinements in the CPF scheme, influencing home\r\n\r\nownership,    healthcare,   family   protection,    asset\r\n\r\nenhancement  and  retirement needs.   And  in  the  years\r\n\r\nahead,   we  could  anticipate  further  refinements   or\r\n\r\nchanges,  as  Singapore  faces significant  economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial   challenges,  from  an  increasingly  competitive\r\n\r\nglobal environment, maturing economy and a rapidly ageing\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report has alluded to the need for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  facilitate  the  provision  of   low-cost\r\n\r\nprivately  managed  pension plans to CPF  members  as  an\r\n\r\nadditional  option under the CPF framework.   I  strongly\r\n\r\nsupport   this  move  and  would  like  to   offer   some\r\n\r\nsuggestions.   This move towards private  sector  pension\r\n\r\nplans  will  allow  greater flexibility  for  members  to\r\n\r\ninvest and secure their own retirement.  And to make this\r\n\r\npossible, I would urge the Government to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) consider allowing members to use their CPF\r\n\r\nmoney to subscribe to private-sector pension schemes;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) review some of our existing policies and rules\r\n\r\nthat  may  pose as obstacles or impediments towards  this\r\n\r\ngoal,  ie,  our  tax regime, to make it  more  \"friendly\"\r\n\r\ntowards annuities, pensions and so on; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) consider an \"opt-out\" option under the Minimum\r\n\r\nSum Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision and contribution by CPF members\r\n\r\ntowards  private-sector pension funds  would  reduce  the\r\n\r\nburden  and dependence on a centralised state-run pension\r\n\r\nfund.  I suggest the Government give more recognition and\r\n\r\naccord  more flexibility on the part of those individuals\r\n\r\nwho are able to look after their own financial affairs in\r\n\r\ncontributing   to  private-sector  pension   schemes   or\r\n\r\ninsurance plans.  This will enable the CPF scheme  to  be\r\n\r\nseen  for  what  it truly is  -  to be a  facilitator  to\r\n\r\nmembers' retirement needs, rather than a burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with this and to encourage individuals to\r\n\r\ntake greater responsibility for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  own financial planning retirement needs,  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest the Government look into introducing an \"opt-out\"\r\n\r\noption  for the Minimum Sum for individuals who are  able\r\n\r\nto  demonstrate  that  they  have  set  aside  more  than\r\n\r\nadequate  resources  for their retirement  needs  through\r\n\r\nprivate-sector pension funds or insurance policies.   And\r\n\r\nthis  is  not limited to just those who are ranked  above\r\n\r\nthe 80th percentile of the wage earners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having a rising Minimum Sum annually beyond\r\n\r\n$80,000  from June next year in line with benchmark  wage\r\n\r\ngrowth  presents  a  number  of  problems.   Firstly,  it\r\n\r\ncreates an illusion for the less financially astute  that\r\n\r\nsince  the  number is Government mandated,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nsufficient for their needs, which is not necessarily  so.\r\n\r\nAs  a  consequence, it may discourage members from taking\r\n\r\ngreater personal responsibility over their own retirement\r\n\r\nneeds,   and  not  make  additional  provisions   through\r\n\r\ninvesting  or  saving  on private pensions  or  insurance\r\n\r\nplans.  This may lead to disappointment in the future as,\r\n\r\nindeed,  the Sub-Committee has rightly pointed  out  that\r\n\r\nthe Minimum Sum may not go far enough to cater for rising\r\n\r\nstandards of living in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, by requiring members to set aside a\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum in addition to what is available from  their\r\n\r\nown retirement planning under private pension schemes  or\r\n\r\nplans  produces an inefficient allocation  of  resources.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are able would  be  better  placed  to\r\n\r\nmanage  the Minimum Sum on their own and would  otherwise\r\n\r\nbe  restricted from using these funds for more productive\r\n\r\ninvestments or entrepreneurial activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it is also inefficient to members who are\r\n\r\nable  to  plan  ahead  to have an  increasing  amount  of\r\n\r\nsavings  tied  down in their Special Accounts  that  have\r\n\r\nlimited  investment  options under  the  current  scheme.\r\n\r\nAllowing  a  greater  use  of  the  Special  Account   to\r\n\r\ncontribute  efficiently to private  pension  plans  would\r\n\r\nboth  benefit  the  individuals as well  as  promote  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment   and   growth  of  the  financial   services\r\n\r\nindustry,  in  particular, the insurance  companies,  for\r\n\r\nwhich the pooling of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  CPF  assets  could  render  them  more  viable  and\r\n\r\nefficient as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as with any changes that will affect the lives\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans,  there  will  be  some  resistance  and\r\n\r\nunhappiness over some of the recommendations that  affect\r\n\r\ndifferent individuals.  However, it is reassuring to hear\r\n\r\nfrom the Government that it will implement the changes as\r\n\r\nrecommended progressively over a period of time,  and  as\r\n\r\npainlessly  as  possible.  I am also  certain  that  with\r\n\r\ngreater information and more publicity, Singaporeans will\r\n\r\nunderstand the need for such changes, and recognise  that\r\n\r\nCPF's  strong  emphasis on individual  responsibility  to\r\n\r\nsecure their retirement expenditure, healthcare and  home\r\n\r\nownership is in their long-term interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Sir, I support the recommendations of\r\n\r\nthe  ERC  Sub-Committee and would urge the Government  to\r\n\r\nfurther  enhance the flexibility of the  CPF  scheme,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  to give greater recognition and  leeway  for\r\n\r\nmembers  to  subscribe to private-sector pension  schemes\r\n\r\nusing  their  CPF money and to withdraw the  Minimum  Sum\r\n\r\namount  should  they  be  able to  show  that  they  have\r\n\r\ninvested in private pension funds on their own, and  have\r\n\r\npensions  or insurance plan resources in excess  of  this\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed changes to our\r\n\r\nCPF  system,  as announced by DPM Lee in his  Ministerial\r\n\r\nStatement, are very prudent and timely.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nshare my views on three aspects of the proposals for  the\r\n\r\nconsideration of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, on the lowering of withdrawal limit\r\n\r\nfor   housing.  I  think  this  is  a  wise  move.   Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are investing a significant part  of  their\r\n\r\nincome  and  savings in housing, some have even  exceeded\r\n\r\ntheir means.  Lowering the withdrawal limit on their  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings  will  help to prevent Singaporeans  from  buying\r\n\r\nproperties beyond their means, thereby ensuring that they\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  caught  in a crunch  when  faced  with  a\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis. On the other hand, as this package\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill be implemented gradually in stages, it will give the\r\n\r\npeople  time to make the necessary adjustment,  and  will\r\n\r\nnot  create  too much of adverse impact on  the  property\r\n\r\nmarket.  I am sure the property developers will  heave  a\r\n\r\nsigh   of   relief.   However,  when  this  lowering   of\r\n\r\nwithdrawal limit has eventually come into full effect, it\r\n\r\nwill  inevitably  affect the property purchasers  because\r\n\r\nonce  they  have  reached the ceiling of  the  withdrawal\r\n\r\nlimit  from their CPF savings, they will have to pay  the\r\n\r\nremaining instalments in cash.  To ease the situation,  I\r\n\r\nhave two suggestions to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I think we should consider allowing the\r\n\r\npurchasers  to  have their properties revalued.   If  the\r\n\r\nproperty  price has gone up, they should  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nraise their withdrawal limit.  Secondly, so long as  they\r\n\r\nhave the Minimum Sum set aside in their CPF account, they\r\n\r\nshould continue to be allowed to use their CPF to pay for\r\n\r\ntheir  housing. After all, they are allowed to use  their\r\n\r\nsurplus amount in their accounts to invest in shares. Why\r\n\r\ndo  we  not allow them to use the money to pay for  their\r\n\r\nown   property  instead?  I think this  will  enable  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  have  more flexibillity in using   their  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me talk about raising of the income floor\r\n\r\nfor  CPF  contribution.  Now that  we  have  many  people\r\n\r\nunemployed,   I  think  we  should  help  these   people,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  in  the lower income  group.  We  must\r\n\r\nencourage  them  to be more flexible and adaptable.  They\r\n\r\nshould  be  persuaded to take up whatever jobs  that  are\r\n\r\navailable  to them, even if the pay does not  meet  their\r\n\r\nexpectations.   They  should take these  jobs  first,  at\r\n\r\nleast  for  the time being. By raising the income  floor,\r\n\r\nthey would enjoy higher take-home pay and be more willing\r\n\r\nto accept lower paid jobs, or  part-time jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to talk about the reduction of\r\n\r\nCPF contribution rates for those aged between 50-55.   On\r\n\r\nthis  recommendation, I must say I am somewhat  relieved.\r\n\r\nAt  least, those aged between 40-50 are not affected,  at\r\n\r\nleast for the time\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeing.   However, I feel that we should be more  cautious\r\n\r\nin  implementing  this  recommendation.   First,  the   4\r\n\r\npercentage point difference may not be enough to make the\r\n\r\nemployers  decide to employ the older workers.   DPM  Lee\r\n\r\nhas   also  said  that  from  experience,  most  of   the\r\n\r\nretrenched older workers had to accept a lower pay.  From\r\n\r\nexperience  they have to accept at least  20%  less  than\r\n\r\nwhat they were drawing before their retrenchment, if they\r\n\r\nwere  to  get  back into the labour market.   Recruitment\r\n\r\ndecisions  are based on many factors and salary  is  just\r\n\r\none  of them. The employers would normally want to employ\r\n\r\nolder   workers  for  their  experience,   maturity   and\r\n\r\nreliability. On the other hand, if the candidate is found\r\n\r\nto  be  unsuitable  for the job, the 4  percentage  point\r\n\r\ndifference is not likely to swing the employer's decision\r\n\r\nin favour of the older candidate for the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I agree with DPM Lee that it would not be\r\n\r\nfair  to  those  who  had  already  made  sacrifices  and\r\n\r\naccepted a wage cut so as to retain their jobs during the\r\n\r\ncrisis. During the bad time, they were told and they  had\r\n\r\naccepted  a  pay cut to help the company stay  viable  in\r\n\r\norder  to  secure  their job. Now  that  the  economy  is\r\n\r\nshowing  signs  of recovery, they are slapped  with  a  4\r\n\r\npercentage  point  reduction in  their  CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nrate.  This  is  a double blow to them.   These  are  the\r\n\r\nworkers who were more responsive to the Government's call\r\n\r\nto  \"bite  the bullet\", yet we are now cutting their  pay\r\n\r\nagain. This is unfair to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I feel that this will send a wrong signal\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  endorses  the  belief  that  older\r\n\r\nworkers are less productive and should therefore be  paid\r\n\r\nless.  I understand that this recommendation is aimed  at\r\n\r\ncountering  the  seniority-based  wage  system.  But,  by\r\n\r\nreducing  the  older workers' CPF contribution  rate,  it\r\n\r\nwill  unintentionally further entrench   this  seniority-based  salary system. We may send the wrong message  that\r\n\r\nseniority-based system is all right since the  Government\r\n\r\nis  finding ways and means to compensate for it.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  we  should instead encourage  employers to adopt  a\r\n\r\nflexible wage system and reward the workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccording to their productivity and contribution. In this\r\n\r\nway, we will be more competitive, and be in a position to\r\n\r\ncompete  globally.  Of course, this is no easy task,  but\r\n\r\nwe  should not shy away from the important task and  take\r\n\r\nthe easy way out. We should give  the employers more time\r\n\r\nto accept and implement  the flexible wage system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like the Government to\r\n\r\nreconsider this move to reduce the CPF contribution  rate\r\n\r\nfor  workers  between the ages of 50  and  55.   If  this\r\n\r\nscheme  has  to  be implemented, then I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to persuade employers to convert the  4%  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings into a variable component of the worker's monthly\r\n\r\nsalary.  If  any particular worker's performance  is  not\r\n\r\nsatisfactory, this variable component can then be removed\r\n\r\nby  his  employer.  This will ensure that  the  employers\r\n\r\nwill not take advantage of Government policy to force the\r\n\r\nworkers  who had already suffered a round of pay  cut  to\r\n\r\ntake  another cut in terms of CPF contribution.  In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  I  am  pleased to note that the  Government  has\r\n\r\ntaken  the lead to compensate the affected civil servants\r\n\r\nin this age group with the TCTC scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's determination to improve our economic\r\n\r\nsituation  through fundamental changes in our CPF  system\r\n\r\nis evident to all. However, the changes to the CPF system\r\n\r\nmust be carried out in parallel with the creation of  job\r\n\r\nopportunities. If there are no new job opportunities, the\r\n\r\nunemployment  situation will not  improve.   I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould,  on  one hand, improve the employability  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers  and,  on the other hand, strive to attract  more\r\n\r\nforeign investments so as to create more jobs. This  way,\r\n\r\nwe   can  then  solve  our  unemployment  problem  at   a\r\n\r\nfundamental level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Ministerial Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nit takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze 3-feet  deep.  Indeed, the problem of CPF has been  brewing\r\n\r\nfor quite some time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after the economic recession in 1986, the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party  suggested that the Government conduct  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  review  of the CPF  system,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nestablish a balance between the people's needs in  saving\r\n\r\nfor  retirement,  housing and medical; and  the  need  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  our  economic  competitiveness.    We   also\r\n\r\ncautioned  about  the people spending their  CPF  savings\r\n\r\nexcessively  on the purchase of properties.  However,  in\r\n\r\nthe  1990s, following a steady economic recovery and  the\r\n\r\nPAP Government relaxing its regulations pertaining to the\r\n\r\npurchase  of property, particularly its tactic  of  using\r\n\r\n\"assets  enhancement\"  as a trump card  for  winning  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Election, it brought about a mad rush among  the\r\n\r\npeople  to upgrade their HDB flats or to purchase private\r\n\r\nproperties.  As a result, CPF members are in a  situation\r\n\r\ntoday,  which the Economic Review Committee describes  as\r\n\r\n\"asset rich but cash poor\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike in 1986, this time round we are also\r\n\r\npressurised by the problem of unemployment brought  about\r\n\r\nby  our transition into a new economy, using the means of\r\n\r\nreducing  the CPF contribution rate in order  to  enhance\r\n\r\nthe  employability of people in a certain age  group  has\r\n\r\nbecome yet another goal of the CPF system, on top of  its\r\n\r\noriginal  aims of ensuring that people have the means  to\r\n\r\npay  for  their  housing loan and medical  expenses;  and\r\n\r\nmaintaining enough cash for their retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to resolve the tension brought about by these\r\n\r\nconflicting  demands?  Faced with an  economic  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  high growth and high employment rate are no  more,\r\n\r\nand   a  future  where  the  population  is  aging,   the\r\n\r\ncumulative  pressure from all these phenomena  makes  the\r\n\r\nproblem  tougher than that in the post-1986  years.  Will\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations of the ERC be effective?  Do we need\r\n\r\nto have another economic review committee to review again\r\n\r\nsoon  after?  We  shall wait and see.   While  the  world\r\n\r\neconomy  is  changing rapidly and the  Asian  economy  is\r\n\r\nshifting its focus, we have to monitor their impact on us\r\n\r\nclosely.   I  am  even  doubtful  that  the  current  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate of 40% can be sustained  in  the  long\r\n\r\nrun.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this situation, we are particularly concerned\r\n\r\nwith  the  impact  brought about by the  Economic  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee's  recommendations on  the  middle  and  lower-income people.  In principle, we agree with this increase\r\n\r\nin  income  floor for contribution to CPF,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nlower-income people will have more take-home pay to  meet\r\n\r\ntheir  daily expenses.  However, we need to look  at  all\r\n\r\nthe ERC's recommendations in total.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, the Government has accepted the\r\n\r\nCommittee's  recommendation to raise  GST,  and  MAS  has\r\n\r\npredicted  that with the increase in GST, inflation  will\r\n\r\nalso go up.  If these two recommendations are implemented\r\n\r\nsimultaneously, the lower-income people will be  back  to\r\n\r\nsquare  one  again  and still have problems  making  ends\r\n\r\nmeet,  once  the  Government  withdraws  all  the  offset\r\n\r\npackages  that come with the GST increase.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  they will lose some savings in their CPF accounts.\r\n\r\nThe Committee holds the view that the lower-income people\r\n\r\ncannot  depend  on  their CPF alone for their  retirement\r\n\r\nneeds.  We  therefore  feel that  the  Government  should\r\n\r\nclearly  indicate  how it is going to help  these  people\r\n\r\ndeal with their problems after retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those middle-income people, whose salary is\r\n\r\nbetween $5,000 and $6,000, ERC's proposal of reducing the\r\n\r\ncontributing  income ceiling will lead to a reduction  in\r\n\r\ntheir  income as a whole.  Not only will they  have  less\r\n\r\nCPF,  the  extra  cash in their take-home  pay  would  be\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  income  tax  too.   Although  they   could\r\n\r\ntransfer  the  cash  back to CPF under the  Supplementary\r\n\r\nRetirement  Scheme,  the pressure brought  about  by  the\r\n\r\nincrease in GST may make it difficult for them to do  so.\r\n\r\nAfter  all  the  Government has said, for  those  with  a\r\n\r\nhigher income, the impact of GST increase on them will be\r\n\r\ngreater.  The ERC has also recommended that people invest\r\n\r\nthese  extra cash on financial products that give  higher\r\n\r\nreturns.   This will inevitably attract higher risk  and,\r\n\r\nof  course, the additional cash that they have will  mean\r\n\r\nmore income tax to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCompared  to the current arrangement, whether the  people\r\n\r\nwill  gain  under the new recommendation  is  a  question\r\n\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For people who are from the above group and whose\r\n\r\nage  falls  within 50 and 55, they will be the  ones  who\r\n\r\nsuffer  most.   The ERC commented that  their  wages  are\r\n\r\nhigher than the younger workers on the same job based  on\r\n\r\nthe  current seniority-based system, and this makes  them\r\n\r\nvulnerable to retrenchment.  The ERC claims that reducing\r\n\r\nthe CPF rate for people in this age group would help them\r\n\r\nto  have better job security, and encourage employers  to\r\n\r\nretain or employ these older workers.  I do not know  how\r\n\r\nthe  Committee has come to this conclusion.  There is  no\r\n\r\nmention  in  the report of how the ERC has come  to  this\r\n\r\nconclusion.  We have also doubts as to how the effects of\r\n\r\nthis recommendation could be evaluated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aim of the ERC is to reform the so-called\r\n\r\nseniority-based  wage  system  so  as  to   enhance   the\r\n\r\nflexibility  of  the wage system and, at the  same  time,\r\n\r\nnarrow the gap of CPF rates between the pre-55 and  post-55  members, then  it would involve not only those in the\r\n\r\n50  to 55 age group.  From the present situation and  the\r\n\r\ndiscussion  prior  to the release of the recommendations,\r\n\r\nit  would  appear that the Government's target of  reform\r\n\r\nwill  not be confined to the 50 to 55 age group. What  is\r\n\r\nthe Government's long-term policy on this?  Should it not\r\n\r\nspell  it  out  clearly to the people so as to  alleviate\r\n\r\ntheir anxiety, and be better prepared psychologically?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has emphasised that this recommendation is\r\n\r\nnot aimed at reducing the cost of the employers.  So they\r\n\r\nencourage  the employers to pay back the savings  to  the\r\n\r\nemployees  through other means.  But will  the  employers\r\n\r\nreally  do that in reality?  Unless the Government  makes\r\n\r\nrules  to  compel  them to do so, this recommendation  is\r\n\r\nindeed  helping  the  employers save  on  their  manpower\r\n\r\nexpenses.   To   those  workers  in   this   age   group,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those who are relatively  stable  in  their\r\n\r\njob,  this  recommendation weakens  their  capability  to\r\n\r\nservice\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  housing  loans and to have more  money  for  their\r\n\r\nretirement.   Does this not run contrary to the  original\r\n\r\nintention of the  ERC?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Special Account, the ERC's\r\n\r\nrecommendation  is to adjust the contribution  rate  from\r\n\r\nthe  4-6-6%  formula  to the 5-7-9%  formula,  after  the\r\n\r\nemployers'  CPF  contribution rates are  fully  restored.\r\n\r\nDid  the  ERC  consider  other combinations?   As  people\r\n\r\nyounger  than  45  are more flexible in reacting  to  the\r\n\r\nchanges  in the labour market, and contributing  more  to\r\n\r\nthe  CPF,  should  we  not increase the  Special  Account\r\n\r\ncontribution rate for those below 45?  At the same  time,\r\n\r\ncan  we not separate the group of 45 to 55 into two  sub-groups  of  45-49 and 50-55?  This will bring us  to  the\r\n\r\nformula  of 7-9-9-6%.  Please refer to the table which  I\r\n\r\nhave  circulated to hon. Members.  In this way, we  could\r\n\r\ncaution  the  young people to be more prudent  in  making\r\n\r\ntheir  decision to purchase property and also to  prepare\r\n\r\nfor  their  retirement much earlier.   Furthermore,  when\r\n\r\nthey  have reached the age of 50 and above, not only will\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF contribution rate be reduced, they will,  more\r\n\r\noften  than  not, have other commitments and  needs,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  paying for their children's university  tuition\r\n\r\nfees  through CPF, the proposed 7-9-9-6 formula will help\r\n\r\nthem be better prepared to service their housing loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has also recommended that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  provide  more means for the  people  to  sell\r\n\r\ntheir  property for cash for their retirement.  We  agree\r\n\r\nwith this recommendation.  However, the Committee has not\r\n\r\nmentioned  how  to  solve the housing  problem  of  these\r\n\r\npeople  who  have  sold  their  properties.   The  Senior\r\n\r\nCitizens  Apartment Scheme introduced by HDB may  be  one\r\n\r\noption.  However, this is only confined to purchases  and\r\n\r\nnot  rentals.  The Government should consider appropriate\r\n\r\npolicy measure to provide rental housing option for those\r\n\r\nwho do not wish to purchase a house.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the enhancement of the returns on CPF funds,\r\n\r\nwe  agree  with the Committee's view. Under  the  present\r\n\r\npractice of individual investment arrangement, it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  difficult  for the investors to attain  the  original\r\n\r\ntarget  of  the  CPF  investment scheme.  The  Government\r\n\r\nshould  consider allowing CPF members to  participate  in\r\n\r\nother  private pension investment plans, or perhaps   set\r\n\r\nup  a  national pension investment scheme so that we  can\r\n\r\npool  our  resources, reduce costs and  to  increase  the\r\n\r\nreturns on investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we agree with this principle of\r\n\r\ngradual  adjustment  to  the  CPF  structure  so  as   to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the CPF's original function of providing  for\r\n\r\nlife  after retirement.  The people should be more  self-reliant,  and start preparing for their retirement  early\r\n\r\nin  life. However, in a tough economic environment, there\r\n\r\nare  bound to be some Singaporeans who are unable to make\r\n\r\nends  meet after retirement.  I would like to remind  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that it has to look after the livelihood  and\r\n\r\nwelfare of this group of people.  This is, after all, the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for this opportunity to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Sub-Committee has recommended many changes\r\n\r\nto  the  CPF system.  The ground sees most of the changes\r\n\r\nas  reasonable  and necessary.  This is  because  workers\r\n\r\nunderstand that it is important to have enough money  set\r\n\r\naside for old age, medical expenses and housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, the proposal to increase the\r\n\r\npercentage  contributions  to Medisave  and  the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  as CPF is progressively restored did  not  raise\r\n\r\nany  eyebrows.  Workers know that this is done for  their\r\n\r\nsake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the tightening of the limits on the use of\r\n\r\nCPF  funds for mortgage payments, workers have  seen  for\r\n\r\nthemselves, in recent years, how the property market  has\r\n\r\nsagged.   They know now that pouring more and more  money\r\n\r\ninto  property purchases, whether it is CPF or  cash,  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  sure-win strategy.  So they understand why it  is\r\n\r\ngood  to  be  prudent about the use of CPF funds  to  pay\r\n\r\nmortgage  interest.  Most of all, they were reassured  to\r\n\r\nlearn\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat   all  HDB  subsidised  loans  and  current  non-HDB\r\n\r\nmortgages will not be affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendation to increase the take-home pay of\r\n\r\nlower-income  workers  by moving the  contribution  floor\r\n\r\nband  from  between $200-$363 currently to between  $500-$750 was also accepted as well meaning and helpful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we all know, the most touchy subjects are\r\n\r\nthose  affecting people's wallets.  So the  most  intense\r\n\r\nfeedback and interest is naturally in this area.   First,\r\n\r\nworkers  remember the Government's reassurance  that  the\r\n\r\ncut  in  the employers' CPF contribution will be restored\r\n\r\nas  quickly as possible in line with what the economy can\r\n\r\nbear.   They see this stand echoed in the Sub-Committee's\r\n\r\nproposals, and they welcome that.  And today, we hear DPM\r\n\r\nLee has once again given this reassurance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, they remember that the Government has\r\n\r\nendorsed  the view that the CPF should not be seen  as  a\r\n\r\nconvenient   tool   for  managing  swings   in   business\r\n\r\nconditions.   It was for this reason that the  tripartite\r\n\r\nNational  Wages  Council proposed  the  Monthly  Variable\r\n\r\nComponent  for  the  wage system.  The Sub-Committee  has\r\n\r\nreinforced support for this stand.  The need to safeguard\r\n\r\nthe  CPF from new cuts is all the more necessary  as  the\r\n\r\nCPF will henceforth be refocused to provide the basic  in\r\n\r\nthose  three key needs.  Workers do not want to  live  in\r\n\r\nconstant  fear  that  their  nest  egg  may  be  targeted\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  because  of  economic  turbulence.    Workers\r\n\r\nexpect   the  Government  and  employers  to  take   this\r\n\r\nseriously and live up to this commitment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, many workers who are in the 50-55 years band\r\n\r\ndislike  the recommendation to freeze the employers'  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate for them at the present  16%.   Why  is\r\n\r\nthat so?  In my view, this results from a combination  of\r\n\r\nanxiety  and  skepticism.  There  are  workers  who  have\r\n\r\nongoing  commitment to service, and who have had to  face\r\n\r\nincreased financial burdens when the employers' CPF rates\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwere  cut  in 1998.  And they, like everyone  else,  were\r\n\r\nlooking forward to progressive restoration of the cuts to\r\n\r\nease  their burdens.  When they hear that their hopes  of\r\n\r\nfurther  restoration  have disappeared,  they  feel  that\r\n\r\nloss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, in my assessment of the feedback, I think\r\n\r\nskepticism is far stronger than anxiety.  Skeptical about\r\n\r\nwhat?  I think it is about two things in particular; one,\r\n\r\nit   is   about  the  purpose,  perhaps  the  intent   of\r\n\r\nGovernment's action; secondly, it is about the  measures'\r\n\r\nlikely effectiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said earlier that workers almost immediately\r\n\r\nunderstood the rationale for most of the recommendations.\r\n\r\nAnd  they had little difficulty in accepting those.  Why?\r\n\r\nIt  is because those recommendations are intuitive.   You\r\n\r\nneed  more  money in the old age, so you must  save  more\r\n\r\nnow.  House prices may go up or they may go down, so  you\r\n\r\nhad  better not put too much of your old-age savings into\r\n\r\nproperty  play.   So  it makes sense to  workers  because\r\n\r\nthese are obvious logic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for this recommendation to freeze the employers'\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution for the 50-55 year olds, it seems  what\r\n\r\nis  obvious to many of the workers is that they see other\r\n\r\npeople going to get their restoration, but they would not\r\n\r\nget their restoration.  So their natural reaction is: why\r\n\r\nare  you targeting me?  Do I not need the money just like\r\n\r\neveryone  else?   And  so  some  may  even  question  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intent,  and  wonder  whether  it  is  done\r\n\r\nprimarily to give employers some cost savings.   And  for\r\n\r\ngood  measure,  they also question whether  such  a  move\r\n\r\nwould, in any case, be effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that it is extremely important for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to explain clearly, and may I say repeatedly,\r\n\r\nthrough all available channels to our workers its sincere\r\n\r\nintent  in this set of proposals.  Older workers want  to\r\n\r\nknow  that  the Government has their interests at  heart,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government cares for them. They want  to  know\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Government  will do to make  sure  that  their\r\n\r\ninterests are indeed well looked after on an on-going and\r\n\r\nholistic basis.  Older workers want the Government to do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore   to   guide   employers  into  positive   behaviour\r\n\r\nconcerning  them  so that they will have fair  treatment.\r\n\r\nThe  specific suggestions on fair rewards, job  redesign,\r\n\r\npointed  out by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang earlier, are pertinent.\r\n\r\nThey want the Government to signal clearly that they  are\r\n\r\nas  precious  to this country as any other  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nSir, this is a frightened group.  And Sir, it is not just\r\n\r\nabout  this particular recommendation alone.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nonly about dollars and cents either.  It is about how the\r\n\r\nGovernment can let the workers know that it is firmly  on\r\n\r\ntheir side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the intent of the Sub-Committee and the\r\n\r\nGovernment clearly indeed is not to reduce the pay of any\r\n\r\nolder worker.  What I see is a Government trying its best\r\n\r\nto  help  by improving the cost competitiveness of  older\r\n\r\nworkers, so that more among the older workers might  have\r\n\r\nmore  years  of  working and earning.  This  intent  must\r\n\r\ntherefore not be misunderstood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, I am happy to hear DPM Lee's\r\n\r\nannouncement  earlier in this House that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  do  more  for  older  workers  through  the  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment    Programme   and   the    People-for-Jobs\r\n\r\nTraineeship  Programme, and that the  Government,  as  an\r\n\r\nemployer,  will take the lead to top-up the  salaries  of\r\n\r\ndeserving  civil service workers affected by the  freeze.\r\n\r\nLet this be a clear signal to the private sector that the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement  expects fair play for  workers  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  and  that  we  call  on  private  sector\r\n\r\nemployers  to emulate the Government's action  for  civil\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Government inform\r\n\r\nall  employers specifically, for example, through the CPF\r\n\r\nBoard, about its call for them to treat deserving workers\r\n\r\nfairly in this CPF restructuring exercise and also  point\r\n\r\nout  that  the Government has set the example.   In  this\r\n\r\nway,  we  would ensure that all employers get the message\r\n\r\nand   that  no  employer  can  misrepresent,  or  present\r\n\r\nincomplete pictures to their less-informed employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I further urge the Government to consider the\r\n\r\nfact that, notwithstanding any improved employability  to\r\n\r\nbe enjoyed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby this group of older workers, they do not enjoy further\r\n\r\nCPF  restoration.   Thus, I appeal to the  Government  to\r\n\r\ntake this into account in future asset-sharing exercises,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  CPF Top-ups, and to give more to these  workers\r\n\r\nwho  are missing out during this transition period as CPF\r\n\r\nis progressively restored.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, it is important for all of us\r\n\r\nto  maintain our focus on the big picture.   The  aim  of\r\n\r\ngood  government must be to secure a better life for  its\r\n\r\ncitizens.   The  outside  world is  changing  fast.   The\r\n\r\ninside world is ageing rapidly.  The risks of dislocation\r\n\r\nare  rising.   Adjustments must be made, and  adjustments\r\n\r\nwill be inconvenient and, sometimes, painful in the short\r\n\r\nrun.   Yet, this House must have the fibre to do what  is\r\n\r\nright  by  our countrymen, in order to lead  them  safely\r\n\r\nthrough the raging storms.  We owe this to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in discussing changes to the CPF system, I\r\n\r\nthink we will need to focus on the key issues and some of\r\n\r\nthe  underlying  reasons  that  led  to  the  Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  A key issue that the ERC has to address\r\n\r\nis  a  fast ageing population and how to adequately  meet\r\n\r\ntheir  retirement needs of which the CPF  is  a  critical\r\n\r\ncomponent.  The average lifespan of Singaporeans has been\r\n\r\nincreasing  over the years.  As a result, in 2030,  there\r\n\r\nwill be 796,000 Singaporeans aged 65 and above, more than\r\n\r\nthree times the number in 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from this, Sir, there are two issues that\r\n\r\nhave  to  be addressed.  First, people have to save  much\r\n\r\nmore   for  retirement.   Second,  people  have  to  stay\r\n\r\nemployed  longer.   The statistics  on  both  counts  are\r\n\r\nworrying.   On the first point, it is clear  that  people\r\n\r\nare  just  not  saving  enough  for  retirement,  despite\r\n\r\nSingapore having one of the highest savings rate  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  In fact, only about half of the CPF members  will\r\n\r\nbe able to reach the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum of $80,000 when they reach 55.  For many, CPF\r\n\r\nhas become the only source of retirement savings.  As use\r\n\r\nof  CPF funds to purchase homes became more liberal, more\r\n\r\nand  more  funds were channelled into housing.  In  1990,\r\n\r\n$1.9  billion  was withdrawn for public housing  but,  in\r\n\r\n2000,  the figure had increased to $8.2 billion, a  four-fold   increase.    During  the  same   period,   private\r\n\r\nresidential  property purchases also went up three  times\r\n\r\nfrom $1.5 billion in 1990 to $4.2 billion in 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERC's proposal to increase the Minimum Sum\r\n\r\nand  the  Special Account contribution rate will help  to\r\n\r\naddress  the current imbalance, and ensure that  more  of\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  savings will be used for retirement.   However,\r\n\r\nthis  by itself is insufficient.  More has to be done  to\r\n\r\neducate  Singaporeans to be prudent in  using  their  CPF\r\n\r\nmoney  for  housing  purchases.  Housing  is  a  critical\r\n\r\ncomponent of our social safety net, and should  remain  a\r\n\r\ncore  element of our CPF system.  No amount of assistance\r\n\r\ncan give the same kind of assurance as having a roof over\r\n\r\none's  head.  But the era of continuous and uninterrupted\r\n\r\nhigh  growth  is  over.   And so is lifetime  employment.\r\n\r\nPeople  now  have to take a lot more risks  arising  from\r\n\r\neconomic  and  business restructuring.  So,  in  deciding\r\n\r\nwhat  house to buy, Singaporeans will have to  take  into\r\n\r\naccount these new realities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to call upon the Government to do\r\n\r\na lot more in educating Singaporeans on this new economic\r\n\r\nand  employment landscape.  I would even suggest that  we\r\n\r\neducate people from the time they are in school about the\r\n\r\nrealities  of the job market and some amount of financial\r\n\r\nplanning as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue is one of employment for older\r\n\r\nworkers.  As people live longer, they have to work longer\r\n\r\ntoo.   The facts, however, are not promising.  Statistics\r\n\r\nshow  that older workers are the ones that are  the  most\r\n\r\naffected   by   retrenchments  and  face   the   greatest\r\n\r\ndifficulty in getting re-employed.  This is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  consistent pattern throughout all the recessions.   In\r\n\r\n1998,  51%  of those retrenched were older  workers.   In\r\n\r\n2001,  46%  of those retrenched were older  workers.   In\r\n\r\nboth recessions, the proportion of those re-employed  who\r\n\r\nwere  in the older age group was lower than those in  the\r\n\r\nyounger  age  group.   In  other  words,  we  do  have  a\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment problem and the older workers are\r\n\r\nthe worst hit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in this context that one has to view the\r\n\r\nnon-restoration of the 4% for workers between the ages of\r\n\r\n50  and  55  years.  Since 1986, we have been introducing\r\n\r\nchanges  to  our wage system but progress has been  slow.\r\n\r\nThe  monthly variable component, for instance,  has  been\r\n\r\nimplemented by only 4.8% of companies in Singapore.   The\r\n\r\naverage  minimum  and  maximum salary  ratio  is  now  at\r\n\r\n1.5:2.0,  lower  than  previous  years,  but  still  high\r\n\r\ncompared  to many countries.  Hence, our wage system  has\r\n\r\nremained very much seniority-based, and older workers are\r\n\r\nplaced at great risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received feedback that older workers are\r\n\r\nbeginning to feel that they are now unwanted or  useless.\r\n\r\nAt one dialogue session with trade unionists, one of them\r\n\r\nsaid  that we should not talk about the problem of  older\r\n\r\nworkers  as  it only makes the situation  worse.   But  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  not talking about the issue of employability\r\n\r\nof  older workers will not make the problem disappear, as\r\n\r\nthe  facts  tell  their own story.  By  discussing  these\r\n\r\nissues  openly,  we  stand  a better  chance  of  raising\r\n\r\nawareness and of collectively finding solutions to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our older workers have contributed\r\n\r\nsignificantly to Singapore's prosperity and growth.  What\r\n\r\nhas  to  be addressed is the seniority-based wage system,\r\n\r\nto   inject  greater  flexibility  and  make  wages  more\r\n\r\nreflective  of the job value.  Hence, I strongly  support\r\n\r\nDPM's  call  that employers pass on part  of  their  cost\r\n\r\nsavings to deserving workers in this age group.  And I am\r\n\r\nmost  heartened that the civil service will take the lead\r\n\r\nby implementing a Transitional CPF non-restoration Top-up\r\n\r\nScheme for civil servants aged 50-55.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the recent statement by Singapore\r\n\r\nTechnologies,  a  GLC, that it will pay  deserving  older\r\n\r\nworkers  in line with the ERC's recommendations, is  also\r\n\r\nmost  reassuring.   I also call upon  all  the  statutory\r\n\r\nboards and the other GLCs to follow suit.  This will send\r\n\r\na strong message to private sector employers that the non-restoration  of  the  CPF  is  not  just  a  cost-cutting\r\n\r\nexercise,  but  is  aimed at enhancing wage  flexibility.\r\n\r\nHence,  I do hope that the private sector employers  will\r\n\r\nexhibit  the same spirit shown by the Government  in  its\r\n\r\ncapacity  as an employer, and we will not have  too  many\r\n\r\ndisputes on our hands over this issue.  The NTUC will  do\r\n\r\nits  part, when the restoration takes place, to ask  that\r\n\r\nemployers pay to deserving older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also welcome the Government's move to extend\r\n\r\nthe  People-for-Jobs  Training Scheme  and  increase  the\r\n\r\nsupport  period for those above 50 years to nine  months,\r\n\r\ninstead of the present six months.  I would like to  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to review other ways  in  which  we  can\r\n\r\nensure non-discrimination against older workers by virtue\r\n\r\nof  their  age  alone.  There have been  complaints  from\r\n\r\nolder  workers  who  have  undergone  training  and   are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  take lower take-home pay  that  they  still\r\n\r\ncannot find jobs.  If employers persist in discriminating\r\n\r\nagainst  older workers because of age, then MOM may  have\r\n\r\nto consider a more effective enforcement mechanism, other\r\n\r\nthan  the tripartite guidelines on non-discrimination  at\r\n\r\nwork, to deal with this problem.  MOM should also monitor\r\n\r\nthe  employment trends in companies and consider  denying\r\n\r\nwork  permits to those who show a consistent  pattern  of\r\n\r\nnot  employing older workers in jobs where age is  not  a\r\n\r\nrequirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, overall the recommendations are\r\n\r\nbalanced,   but   there  are  older  and   lower   income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  will  face difficulties,  particularly\r\n\r\nduring the adjustment period.  I therefore call upon  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  monitor the situation of  this  group  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and extend all possible assistance to  them.\r\n\r\nI also agree with my other parliamentary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncolleagues from the labour movement to ask the Government\r\n\r\nto  consider giving them extra shares or CPF top-ups,  as\r\n\r\nand when the Government makes such payments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the changes to the CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the CPF scheme has been set up  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  people  have enough savings to  satisfy  their\r\n\r\nretirement   needs.   But  over  the  past   years,   the\r\n\r\nconditions  and  rules  governing  our  CPF  system  have\r\n\r\ngradually  been  relaxed. The people are lavishly  making\r\n\r\nuse  of  their  CPF money for various purposes,  such  as\r\n\r\npurchase   of  property,  shares,  insurance,  children's\r\n\r\nuniversity  education,  medical expenses,  and  even  for\r\n\r\nchildbirth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, any change to the employer's CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate would attract a lot of attention as  it\r\n\r\nhas  formed a component part of the wages of the  people.\r\n\r\nSo,  any reduction in this rate will be viewed as  a  pay\r\n\r\ncut.   In  a  bad  time, a reduction  in  employers'  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  is  advocated  as  a  means  to  help   the\r\n\r\nemployers  tide over the troubled waters to  ensure  that\r\n\r\njobs  are  saved,  and  the workers  are  asked  to  make\r\n\r\nsacrifices  in  order  that  they  can  go  through   the\r\n\r\ndifficult period together with the employers.  This  kind\r\n\r\nof  sacrifice  is  worthwhile.  At  this  time  when  the\r\n\r\neconomy is beginning to pick up, we are proposing to  cut\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF  contributions  because  of  new  factors  and\r\n\r\ncircumstances. I think such an arrangement at  this  time\r\n\r\nwarrants our further deliberation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For whatever reasons, the effect of all these\r\n\r\narrangements  is that the workers' pay is  reduced.   The\r\n\r\nemployers  reduce their wage cost.  The  Government  gave\r\n\r\ntwo  reasons why they cut the CPF contributions.  One  of\r\n\r\nthe  explanations is that the people in the higher income\r\n\r\nbrackets  have their own means to flexibly  manage  their\r\n\r\nsavings.   They do not have to depend on this  compulsory\r\n\r\nsavings scheme to meet their retirement needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThey have enough means to look after themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government said was only partially correct.\r\n\r\nThe  incorrect  part  is  that  why  the  20%  employer's\r\n\r\ncontribution from $5,000 to $6,000 is taken away.   Under\r\n\r\nthis  new  measure,  before the employee  could  flexibly\r\n\r\nmanage   the   $200  per  month  of  reduced   employee's\r\n\r\ncontribution, he already loses $200 due to the cut in the\r\n\r\nemployers' CPF contribution.  I think this new measure is\r\n\r\nunfair to the employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the ERC has already mentioned in passing\r\n\r\nthat  the employers should try to pass on the savings  to\r\n\r\ntheir  employees, it has not given any indication of  how\r\n\r\nthis  arrangement can materialise.  I would  expect  that\r\n\r\nthe  employers will simply pocket the savings, and  leave\r\n\r\nthe  employees  to  work out their own  problems.   There\r\n\r\nshould  be  more  concrete measures to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nemployees will stand to benefit from the savings of their\r\n\r\nemployers,  so  that this saving from the employer's  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution will become a component of the wages.  So  I\r\n\r\nhope  that the Government will take the lead to  pass  on\r\n\r\nthis  benefit to the civil servants and make it  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  variable wage component, to set an example  for  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector employers to emulate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the report, it was also recommended that\r\n\r\nemployers'  CPF contribution for workers  aged  50-55  be\r\n\r\nfrozen at 16%.  In other words, for employees in this age\r\n\r\ngroup, when the employers' CPF contribution rate for  the\r\n\r\nother  workers is fully restored to 20%, theirs  will  be\r\n\r\nfrozen at 16%.  The reason given for this proposed change\r\n\r\nis  to  ensure  that  people in this age  group  who  are\r\n\r\nunemployed  will find it easier to get a job,  and  those\r\n\r\ncurrently employed will not be retrenched so readily.   I\r\n\r\nhave some doubts on this measure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, from the way it is worded, I observe that\r\n\r\nthis  measure  is  to  tackle a  problem  when  there  is\r\n\r\nretrenchment and high unemployment rate. This is the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npresumption  for  this measure to  be  taken.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords, when the economy has recovered, and there is  full\r\n\r\nemployment,  there will be no meaning  to  this  measure,\r\n\r\nexcept that the wages of the workers are reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1988 until today, the economic performance of\r\n\r\nSingapore  was good for about 70-80% of the time.   There\r\n\r\nwere  only about 20-30% of the time when our economy  was\r\n\r\nbad.  The contribution rate of CPF should be based on the\r\n\r\ngood  times and make adjustment when the economy is  bad.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, we should not use the standard made  for\r\n\r\nthe  bad times as a general policy.  This is because when\r\n\r\nthe  economy has recovered, all these cuts and reductions\r\n\r\nin  the  CPF contribution rates are unable to be restored\r\n\r\nbecause it is a general policy.  The consequence is  that\r\n\r\nthe workers are unable to make good their losses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, are workers who are aged 50-55 really that\r\n\r\nold,  that useless, or their salary is so high that  they\r\n\r\nare  not worth employing?  If this assumption is correct,\r\n\r\nand it is also reflected generally, then we should take a\r\n\r\nlook  at our Members in this House today.  More than  50%\r\n\r\nof  our  Members of Parliament are above the age  of  50.\r\n\r\nFrom this angle, we can see clearly one point, ie, age is\r\n\r\nnot  a  hindrance to employability.  The point is whether\r\n\r\nthey  can  get  their money's worth or are they  able  to\r\n\r\ncontribute their worth, to get their job and to make them\r\n\r\nworth  being  employed.  Cutting of  the  employer's  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution is not the solution to their employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From statistics, there are some 12,000 people in\r\n\r\nthis  age  group who are currently unemployed.   Does  it\r\n\r\nmean that once their CPF contribution rate is reduced  to\r\n\r\n16%,  they will automatically get employment? Before  the\r\n\r\nfull  recovery  of our economy, their employability  will\r\n\r\nmean  the  unemployability of  other  people.  One  older\r\n\r\nworker  employed will mean one younger worker unemployed.\r\n\r\nUsing  the  same  argument, do we want  to  cut  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate of these younger workers to 16% to help\r\n\r\nthem get employment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen if our economy is fully recovered?\r\n\r\nThe workers enjoy full employment and, again, the foreign\r\n\r\nworker  population rises above 500,000.  All the  workers\r\n\r\naged   between  50-60  are  no  longer  faced  with   the\r\n\r\nemployability pressure.  My question is whether  we  will\r\n\r\nbase  on  the  same  argument  to  reinstate  their   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution.  The argument is when employability is  low\r\n\r\nwe  cut  their  CPF.  When there is no such employability\r\n\r\npressure, should not the CPF be restored?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above points raised, I have a lot of doubts\r\n\r\nabout this measure.  I feel that the argument of freezing\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  of those aged 50-55 at 16% to ensure that  they\r\n\r\nkeep  their jobs or help the retrenched workers  to  find\r\n\r\njobs is weak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the strong negative opinion on the cut in\r\n\r\nemployer's  CPF contribution, there are also  many  other\r\n\r\nERC's  recommendations on changes  to  our  existing  CPF\r\n\r\nsystem.   In general, there are measures which  would  be\r\n\r\nbeneficial  to  the  people.  I support  the  Ministerial\r\n\r\nStatement to accept these recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, first of all, I would like to commend  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review  Committee in  adopting  a  consultative\r\n\r\napproach  to discuss with the people and also to consider\r\n\r\nall  the  impacts on the people from all  walks  of  life\r\n\r\nbefore they make their recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to feedback from the people, this process\r\n\r\nof consultation is very good.  I hope that in future when\r\n\r\nGovernment wants to make any new policies, it  would  use\r\n\r\nsuch a consultative approach.  It may be more work but  I\r\n\r\nthink it is worth it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say that the CPF scheme has contributed\r\n\r\ngreatly  to  our  nation-building.   Since  the  time  of\r\n\r\nindependence, we have been proud of our CPF system as  it\r\n\r\nserves  as  a  safety net for the welfare of our  people.\r\n\r\nWith   this   CPF   safety  net,   we   facilitated   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the  home ownership  scheme  for  our\r\n\r\npeople  and  took  care of healthcare  expenses  for  our\r\n\r\npeople through the Medisave scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nApart  from  its  role as a social safety  net,  the  CPF\r\n\r\nscheme  has  also  been  used as  a  sort  of  buffer  in\r\n\r\nadjusting the wages of our workers during the bad  times.\r\n\r\nIf  we do not have CPF, then we would have to hit on  the\r\n\r\nactual wages of our workers, and I think it would be more\r\n\r\ndifficult for us to recover from a recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the acute recession in the 1980s, we helped\r\n\r\nthe  businesses  to  reduce their labour  costs  to  stay\r\n\r\nafloat  by cutting the employers' CPF contribution rates.\r\n\r\nThis way, most of the businesses managed to tide over the\r\n\r\ndifficult times with the workers' rice-bowls kept intact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after the recovery of the economy, people\r\n\r\nbegan to withdraw excessively from their CPF accounts  to\r\n\r\nspeculate on the property market. This is a genuine cause\r\n\r\nfor concern. There should be some restrictions on the use\r\n\r\nof CPF money for property investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people feel that with globalisation,\r\n\r\ncompetition has become very intense. We should  therefore\r\n\r\nhave  a  comprehensive review of our existing CPF system.\r\n\r\nThe functions and roles of CPF are becoming more and more\r\n\r\ncomplicated.   Now, CPF is also used as an  adjuster  for\r\n\r\nthe employability of our workers!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the ERC report and DPM Lee's\r\n\r\nstatement,  I  would  like to  present  my  views.   This\r\n\r\nadjustment of CPF income floor from $200 to $500 is  very\r\n\r\ngood.   In 1996, when I was in NTUC, we proposed  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower to raise this income floor  for  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions in order to encourage more women to  return\r\n\r\nto the workforce. It was then turned down. I am glad that\r\n\r\nit  has now been recommended by the ERC.  So, I hope that\r\n\r\non this occasion, more women would take advantage of this\r\n\r\nscheme  to  get  back to the workforce.   Just  now,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Manpower has said that we may  delay  this\r\n\r\nscheme  because  of  the economic recession.   I  beg  to\r\n\r\ndiffer.   If  we  want  to improve our  productivity,  we\r\n\r\nshould  encourage more women to return to the  workforce.\r\n\r\nOne  of  the important points is that we should encourage\r\n\r\nmore flexible\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwork   schemes   or  part-time  jobs   for   the   women,\r\n\r\nparticularly  when  their  husbands  are  retrenched   or\r\n\r\nunemployed.  It will be all the more important  that  the\r\n\r\nwomen  return to the workforce.  They can help to support\r\n\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the reduction of CPF contribution rate from\r\n\r\n40%  to 32% for older workers between the ages of 50  and\r\n\r\n55,  this is one of the most hotly discussed topics.  For\r\n\r\nworkers  in  this  age group, they  will  not  see  their\r\n\r\nemployers' CPF contribution rate restored to 20% when the\r\n\r\nothers finally get theirs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the South West Community Development\r\n\r\nCouncil's  job-matching data, those who are  affected  by\r\n\r\neconomic  recession  and have come  to  us  for  help  in\r\n\r\ngetting  a  job, some 30.5% are from the 40-49 age  group\r\n\r\nand 13% from the 50-59 age group.  So, strictly speaking,\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  affected  are not  confined  to  workers\r\n\r\nbetween the ages of 50 and 59.  Even those who are 40 and\r\n\r\nabove are already affected by this retrenchment trend.  I\r\n\r\nwas quite surprised by the figures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some consultation, the Government's\r\n\r\nrecommendation  now is to reduce the CPF rates  only  for\r\n\r\nthose  between 50 and 55.  Of course, the presumption  is\r\n\r\nthat  by  reducing the labour cost on these workers,  the\r\n\r\nemployers will be less inclined to retrench them and they\r\n\r\nstand  a  better  chance  of retaining  their  jobs.  But\r\n\r\nwhether or not this will create employability, I think we\r\n\r\nhave to look further into it. Employability concerns  not\r\n\r\nonly the labour cost, but also on other attributes of the\r\n\r\nworkers  such  as work attitude, competence,  ability  to\r\n\r\nwork  as  a  team, etc.  I hope the Ministry of  Manpower\r\n\r\nwould  set  up a committee to look into the employability\r\n\r\nof workers who are 40 years and above and conduct more in-depth study into their employability issues.  A number of\r\n\r\nschemes are already in place to help them but whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  they  are effective, we do not know.  We  have  also\r\n\r\nintroduced this incentive for lifelong learning.  But has\r\n\r\nthis been proven to be effective?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I would like to bring up concerns\r\n\r\nthe  4% reduction in employers' CPF contribution. I would\r\n\r\nsuggest  we set aside 1%  for a Personal Training Account\r\n\r\nin the CPF.  This point has been brought up several times\r\n\r\nbefore.   I think this will tell the workers that  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  just to reduce their CPF, but we want  to  set\r\n\r\naside  part of it to set up a training account for  them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  1% should be used to set up a training  account\r\n\r\nin their CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that I feel that employers should\r\n\r\nbe  more positive in their attitude.  Over the years,  we\r\n\r\nhave  read  a lot of reports in the newspapers concerning\r\n\r\ndiscussions  on  how to reduce business  cost,  including\r\n\r\nlabour  cost. As reflected in these reports, it is always\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unions  and the Government who  are  actively\r\n\r\npursuing the matter. Very little has been reported on the\r\n\r\nemployers'  involvement in this.  We  talk  a  lot  about\r\n\r\nglobalisation  nowadays. But it is always the  Government\r\n\r\nwhich  is  doing  the talking.  In other  countries,  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  projects are initiated by the private  sector,\r\n\r\neg,  IBM,  AT&T,  Johnson  & Johnson,  etc,  whereby  the\r\n\r\nworkers  are briefed on the global trend of business  and\r\n\r\nthe  company's  reaction  to all these  changing  trends.\r\n\r\nThis  would  enable  the workers to know  what  direction\r\n\r\ntheir  company is heading towards so that they  could  do\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  adjustment and make early preparation  to\r\n\r\nadapt  to  all  these  changes.  But  in  Singapore,  our\r\n\r\nemployers  are not very active.  Here in Singapore,  only\r\n\r\nthe  MCDS  is  doing this sort of thing. I feel  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  explain  to  our workers the perspective  of  the\r\n\r\nemployers,  let  them know the competition  that  we  are\r\n\r\nfacing and the various aspects of globalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel our employers should not wait for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to solve their problems for them.  They should\r\n\r\nbe  more  proactive  in explaining  to  the  workers  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of training and the importance  of  enhancing\r\n\r\ntheir productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to touch on is the\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum.  At the moment, our target is  $80,000  but\r\n\r\nafter  2003, it is suggested that it goes beyond $80,000.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npersonally  support this because with our families  going\r\n\r\ninto  nuclear family units, many senior citizens need  to\r\n\r\nwork  to  support  themselves.  Of course,  we  want  our\r\n\r\nchildren to be filial to their parents.  But nowadays, we\r\n\r\ncan see there are more single parents and a lot of people\r\n\r\nhave  no children to support them.  With the increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  Minimum Sum, better protection will be provided  for\r\n\r\nthe old folks to meet their retirement needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those higher income workers, we have now\r\n\r\nreduced the income ceiling for CPF contributions.  I feel\r\n\r\nthat  they  should  be able to take  care  of  themselves\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are among the top 12% of  our  population.\r\n\r\nThe   Government   has   introduced   the   Supplementary\r\n\r\nRetirement Scheme whereby the high income earners can set\r\n\r\naside  additional savings in it to earn better  interest.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to know what is the take-up rate for  this\r\n\r\nscheme since its implementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have been investing in shares. I do not\r\n\r\nthink  that many of them have actually made profits  from\r\n\r\nthere.  Perhaps, we should have more education programmes\r\n\r\nfor our CPF members so that they would know how to invest\r\n\r\nwisely.   I  think most Singaporeans do not have  a  good\r\n\r\nenough knowledge on how to invest their money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the people's reaction to these\r\n\r\nrecommendations to change our CPF system is certainly not\r\n\r\nas  hotly debated as the earlier 3-cent increase  in  bus\r\n\r\nfares.   I  think  this  is probably  due  to  the  prior\r\n\r\nconsultative  approach  by the Government.   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  very  rational.   They understand  that  under  this\r\n\r\ngloblisation    trend,   in   order   to    retain    our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness, we have to reform.  But I urge  the  ERC\r\n\r\nand  MOM to set up a committee to review and to re-assess\r\n\r\nthe effect of all our training schemes so that they could\r\n\r\nbe  implemented more effectively and workers who  are  40\r\n\r\nand above would increase their employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Ministerial Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, we have\r\n\r\nliterally come one full circle.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen the CPF scheme was set up in 1955, it started off as\r\n\r\na  very conservative scheme.  In the 1980s and 1990s,  we\r\n\r\nstarted on a liberal track and now, we are trying  to  be\r\n\r\nback on the conservative route.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, I congratulate the ERC Sub-Committee on its recommendations in focusing on the three\r\n\r\nkey  aims of the CPF, which are housing, medical care and\r\n\r\nold-age subsistence.  Sir, the recommendations remove the\r\n\r\nuncertainty  in the property market and, hopefully,  will\r\n\r\nbring about a sustainable and rational property market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the proposal to increase the contribution\r\n\r\nto the Special Account by 1%.  Sir, I remember when I sat\r\n\r\non  the  Inter-Ministry Committee on Ageing, one  of  the\r\n\r\nconcerns of the Committee was whether, when people  reach\r\n\r\nold  age,  they  have  sufficient savings  in  their  CPF\r\n\r\naccount.  I am very happy to see that this recommendation\r\n\r\nhas been included in the ERC and is seeing fruition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the ERC that the amount set aside\r\n\r\nfor our old-age subsistence should be increased gradually\r\n\r\nto  adjust  for cost of living and increasing income.   I\r\n\r\nalso  welcome the measure to give low-income workers more\r\n\r\ntake-home  pay by raising the employee CPF wage  band  to\r\n\r\n$500-$750.  I am confident that this would also encourage\r\n\r\nmore  to  join the workforce and enjoy a bigger take-home\r\n\r\npay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the issue of\r\n\r\nemployability of older workers in the age group of  50-55\r\n\r\nyears  whose  employer and employee  CPF  rates  will  be\r\n\r\ncapped  at  16%.   I would like to ask  the  DPM  whether\r\n\r\nreducing the CPF rates for this group will increase their\r\n\r\nemployability.    The  market  mechanism,   as   it   is,\r\n\r\ndetermines the salary of these older workers.   Many  who\r\n\r\nwere  re-employed after their retrenchment were  actually\r\n\r\nre-employed at lower salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the unemployment figure for\r\n\r\nthis  age group is about 11%.  This is due to the present\r\n\r\neconomic climate.  I remember watching a Channel\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNewsAsia  interview last week which highlighted that  for\r\n\r\nmany  employers, the reduction of the employers' CPF rate\r\n\r\nwould  not  make  them  recruit older  workers.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsincerely  have  my  doubts whether  this  measure  would\r\n\r\nreally help the older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, I would like to ask the DPM as to how\r\n\r\nmany  older workers have been recruited by the Government\r\n\r\nover  the last few years and whether the latest  CPF  cut\r\n\r\nwould  mean  that  the  Government itself  would  set  an\r\n\r\nexample by recruiting older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would help to give us a better gauge as to\r\n\r\nwhether this measure will have the impact that it  really\r\n\r\nintends  to have.  My sense is that we have unnecessarily\r\n\r\ncut  the  wages of 89% of the workers in trying to  solve\r\n\r\nthis  problem.  In addition, I would like to ask  whether\r\n\r\nwe  can expect the private sector to reward older workers\r\n\r\nby  channelling  the  reduced  CPF  contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nmonthly  variable component of the salaried staff.   Sir,\r\n\r\nas  Mdm  Halimah highlighted, as it is, only 4.8% of  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  employers contribute  to  this  or  have\r\n\r\nstarted  implementing  this monthly  variable  component.\r\n\r\nFor  a start, to expect the employers to include this  is\r\n\r\nitself  an  uphill task.  And I wonder whether this  will\r\n\r\nhave  the desired effect in asking the employers  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector to pass on the cost saving in this CPF cut\r\n\r\nto the employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as it is, it is not a mandatory measure and to\r\n\r\nexpect  the  employers  to do so  without  any  mandatory\r\n\r\nrequirement, I think is a very difficult exercise  and  I\r\n\r\nam  not sure whether we will succeed.  Perhaps, we  could\r\n\r\nhave   carefully  considered  this  particular   measure.\r\n\r\nUpgrading  their  skills, creating more jobs  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  a better option and even perhaps having this  as  a\r\n\r\nshort-term measure and reverting back to a 20%  employer-employee  contribution would be better when  the  economy\r\n\r\nrecovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the changes in the CPF\r\n\r\nhousing scheme.  Here, there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  many questions which are thrown up, which I am quite\r\n\r\nsure  many Singaporeans want to know the answers.   First\r\n\r\nof  all,  was there a real necessity to tinker  with  the\r\n\r\nsystem  which  has served us well?  CPF members'  savings\r\n\r\nwere protected, as the bank mortgage took second priority\r\n\r\nto   the   CPF  charge  in  private  property  purchases.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this  has now changed.  When there  is  nothing\r\n\r\nfundamentally  wrong  with the present  arrangement,  why\r\n\r\nchange the regime?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, once the banks are given priority in\r\n\r\nunsubsidised  housing loans for HDB flats  and  they  are\r\n\r\nentitled to take possession and sell these flats when the\r\n\r\nowners  default,  it throws up a bigger  question.   Many\r\n\r\ncreditors whose debtors are staying in HDB flats will now\r\n\r\npressure and ask the Government if private banks can  now\r\n\r\ntake   over  HDB  properties  and  realise  their  loans.\r\n\r\nCertainly  other  creditors out there will  pressure  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to open up the HDB property to be  seized  by\r\n\r\nother  creditors to whom the owner of the flat owes  them\r\n\r\nmoney.   And do we move on to the second stage and remove\r\n\r\nthis  protection for subsidised HDB flats away from these\r\n\r\ncreditors?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to-date, HDB is very sympathetic to HDB\r\n\r\nborrowers.   It grants them extended periods  to  pay  if\r\n\r\nthey are in financial difficulties, and repossession is a\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  last  resort.  How will the Government  then\r\n\r\nensure  that such measures will be in place to provide  a\r\n\r\nbuffer  for such people?  And I am quite sure the  number\r\n\r\nof  people  who are going to take loans from the  private\r\n\r\nbanks  for purchasing HDB flats will only grow in number.\r\n\r\nThe next time a recession comes along, I think there will\r\n\r\nbe  a  greater expectation on the part of this  group  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to pressure the Government to pressure  the\r\n\r\nbanks  to  withhold taking action against them.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether the Government will take into account  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the bank or the interest of the borrowers  in\r\n\r\ntrying to arrive at a solution that is palatable to  both\r\n\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second element is that, at the moment, the\r\n\r\ninterest rate in the market is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvery  attractive.  As such, many will go and take a loan.\r\n\r\nBut  in future, interest rates will increase and many  of\r\n\r\nthe  borrowers will default on their loans.   Again,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  arises:  how do we temper  the  pain  that  the\r\n\r\npopulation will face when interest rates rise?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, another issue that again arises is that\r\n\r\nwhen  the  bank repossesses the property and the mortgage\r\n\r\nsale  proceeds are unable to satisfy the amount withdrawn\r\n\r\nfrom  the  CPF  account, will the CPF Board  pursue  full\r\n\r\nlegal  remedies  against the members?   Because,  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  if one has paid up the CPF account and the  bank\r\n\r\nis   not paid in full, the bank will take legal action to\r\n\r\nrecover the full amount.  But with the new scenario, when\r\n\r\nthe member is unable to pay up the CPF amount in full, my\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  will  the  CPF Board  take  legal  action,\r\n\r\nincluding  making  one bankrupt, to make  sure  that  his\r\n\r\naccount is repaid back?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, Sir, by allowing the 10% downpayment to be\r\n\r\npaid  from the CPF account, whether this will kick  start\r\n\r\nthe  property  market and actually go against  the  anti-speculation measures that we have in place as far as  the\r\n\r\nproperty market is concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, in the past, reverse mortgages were not\r\n\r\nfeasible,   because   HDB  properties   were   considered\r\n\r\nsacrosanct.  But now, with the liberalising  of  the  HDB\r\n\r\nproperty  market and by allowing banks to provide  loans,\r\n\r\nmy   question  is  whether  reverse  mortgages   can   be\r\n\r\nconsidered  as  a  serious  alternative;  and,  as  such,\r\n\r\nwhether  we  can allow more Singaporeans to cash  out  of\r\n\r\ntheir property while they are staying in it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on those notes, let me once again welcome the\r\n\r\nmajor  recommendations of the Economic Review  Committee,\r\n\r\nand I am quite sure that many of the intended purposes of\r\n\r\nthe Committee will see light.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for allowing me to speak on the changes to\r\n\r\nthe CPF scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is nearly half-a-century-long legacy, the CPF has\r\n\r\ncreated Singaporeans to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\none  of  the  world's highest home owning population.   I\r\n\r\ncongratulate the move now by the Government to take stock\r\n\r\nof the CPF and to re-evaluate it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to focus on five points. My first\r\n\r\nconcern  is  the alarming trend that over the years,  CPF\r\n\r\nhas  been heavily relied upon for home ownership.  I feel\r\n\r\nthat  too much of our savings in the CPF has been devoted\r\n\r\nfor our housing needs.  I wish to highlight statistics to\r\n\r\nsupport  my concern.  As of 31st March 2002, $92  billion\r\n\r\nhas been withdrawn from the CPF Board for the purchase of\r\n\r\nproperties,  out of which about two-thirds are  used  for\r\n\r\npublic  housing.  From January to March this year  alone,\r\n\r\n$3  billion was used for the purchase of properties, with\r\n\r\n70%  of  it  tied  up  in  public  housing  schemes.   In\r\n\r\ncomparison, only $510 million is for retirement, and $114\r\n\r\nmillion for healthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern is the depletion of the value of\r\n\r\nhomes in deflationary times.  As rightly put forth by the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review Committee, the property  market  has  an\r\n\r\nimpact  on many things.  To the many Singaporeans outside\r\n\r\nthis  House, they are most concerned with the  impact  on\r\n\r\nindividual  household,  financial  condition  and   asset\r\n\r\nvalue.  Let me elaborate.  When property prices rise,  we\r\n\r\nsee a parallel increase in withdrawal in our CPF savings,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  allowed based on the formula of withdrawal  at\r\n\r\n150%  of  the  value of the property.  I agree  with  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  that this be gradually lowered  to  120%,\r\n\r\nthe   reason  being  when  property  values  drop  in   a\r\n\r\ndeflationary   period  and  negative   asset   value   is\r\n\r\nexperienced  as too much money has been spent  on  buying\r\n\r\nthat  asset.  At present, some Singaporeans have  already\r\n\r\nexperienced a permanent depletion of their CPF savings as\r\n\r\na  result.  The value of their properties has fallen  and\r\n\r\nmay  not rise again to the level of their purchase price.\r\n\r\nToday, the ownership of this form of asset, if not  fully\r\n\r\npaid  for,  may  prove  to be a  liability  if  there  is\r\n\r\ninsufficient balance in one's CPF account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To curb such excessive spending, we must go back to\r\n\r\nthe  original  purpose of our CPF  savings   -   that  of\r\n\r\nmeeting our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nretirement  needs.   We need to avoid a  situation  where\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  cash poor and  asset  poor  when  they\r\n\r\nretire.   We  must  therefore create a  public  awareness\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  dissuade  Singaporeans  from  spending  on\r\n\r\nproperty in anticipation of a double digit growth in  our\r\n\r\neconomy, as was seen in the late 80s and a good  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  90s.  Those years saw the value of properties rising\r\n\r\nbeyond  the reach of most Singaporeans.  But the  booming\r\n\r\nproperty  market  has led many to throw  caution  to  the\r\n\r\nwind.   To  expect  such time again is but  an  illusion.\r\n\r\nWith  Singapore becoming a more mature economy towards  a\r\n\r\ndeveloped nation, growth rates of a single digit such  as\r\n\r\n3-5%  will  become  a  norm.  Future growth  in  property\r\n\r\nprices  will follow economic trends, and we will not  see\r\n\r\nfast  rising property market for some time to come.   The\r\n\r\nneed  to fork out cash under the new recommendation would\r\n\r\nhelp  Singaporeans to be more realistic in buying a  home\r\n\r\nnot beyond their means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next, I wish to draw DPM's attention to the\r\n\r\nmove  to  allow banks to participate in granting  housing\r\n\r\nloans to HDB property owners.  This is indeed a bold move\r\n\r\nby the Government.  Not only does it allow interest rates\r\n\r\nto  be  pegged to market rates, it also allows  banks  to\r\n\r\nhave  first  claim against the property  before  the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard.  However, to attract banks to participate in  this\r\n\r\nsector, a strong resale market must be in place to  allow\r\n\r\nbanks  to  have  a  second  hand  market  to  dispose  of\r\n\r\nproperties  in  the event of a default by the  borrowers.\r\n\r\nHere, HDB will have to monitor carefully the supply  side\r\n\r\nof  the market and avoid an over supply, thus encouraging\r\n\r\nbuyers from choosing new flats as opposed to old ones  in\r\n\r\nthe resale market.  Some Singaporeans have voiced concern\r\n\r\nover  the  banks taking on their role.  They are  worried\r\n\r\nthat   banks,   being   what  they   are,   profit-making\r\n\r\ncorporations will be less lenient and less ready to  help\r\n\r\nthe   man-in-the-street  during  economic  downturns   as\r\n\r\ncompared  to  the Government.  Banks are  accountable  to\r\n\r\ntheir  shareholders and are concerned about their  bottom\r\n\r\nline.   I would like to ask the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister whether safety nets will be put in place to help\r\n\r\nfamilies  whose homes might be seized by  the  banks  and\r\n\r\nleft homeless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another problem I wish to highlight is the\r\n\r\navailability of cash if the balances in CPF  savings  are\r\n\r\nnot going to be sufficient enough to cater for retirement\r\n\r\nneeds.   Statistics from the CPF Board in the  year  2000\r\n\r\nshow  that  more than 600,000 CPF members have less  than\r\n\r\n$80,000,  the  Minimum Sum required to be  maintained  in\r\n\r\ntheir   accounts   by   July   next   year.    As    more\r\n\r\nresponsibilities in managing CPF savings are passed  down\r\n\r\nto  contributors to the Fund, a liberal use  of  CPF  for\r\n\r\ninvestment in the Ordinary Account must surely be reduced\r\n\r\ngradually.  The Ordinary Account should be encouraged  to\r\n\r\ngrow in the same proportion, if not more than the Special\r\n\r\nAccount.  This is to ensure that savings in the  CPF  are\r\n\r\nclose  to  sufficient  for  old  age.   Total  CPF  funds\r\n\r\ninvested  as  at  31st March 2002 stood at  $26  billion.\r\n\r\nTotal  funds  still  available  for  investment  in   the\r\n\r\nOrdinary  and  Special Accounts are $52 billion  and  $12\r\n\r\nbillion  respectively.  Furthermore, the balance  in  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Account  of $80,000  -  the Minimum  Sum  to  be\r\n\r\nmaintained in the CPF account  - will not meet the  needs\r\n\r\nof  most Singaporeans as the standard of living rises and\r\n\r\npeople   tend   to   live  longer.    To   counter   this\r\n\r\nvulnerability, the Government has recommended to increase\r\n\r\ncash  available at retirement by raising CPF contribution\r\n\r\nto members' Special Accounts by one percentage point once\r\n\r\nCPF rates are restored to 40%, requiring the CPF to pay a\r\n\r\nhigher  and more appropriate long-term interest  rate  on\r\n\r\nSpecial Account balances and raising the Minimum  Sum  to\r\n\r\nbe  kept  in  CPF  accounts beyond the current  level  of\r\n\r\n$80,000.   These efforts may be too late and  too  little\r\n\r\nfor  some.  As most Singaporeans have a home now  and  as\r\n\r\nincome  potential  drops,  as  one  gets  older   or   is\r\n\r\nretrenched,  the temptation to convert their property  to\r\n\r\ncash  to  supplement their CPF increases.  This then  may\r\n\r\nresult  in  a whole new spectrum of housing problems  for\r\n\r\nthis  group  of people, as they have to find  alternative\r\n\r\nhousing.  What I foresee is a class of rental housing may\r\n\r\neventually  have  to  be created to  meet  this  possible\r\n\r\nfuture need.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I would like to voice my concern\r\n\r\non  the  CPF rate for older workers.  Under the proposal,\r\n\r\nolder  workers  will  see  their total  CPF  contribution\r\n\r\ncapped  at  32%,  down from the current 36%.   Their  own\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate will also be down  from  20%  to  16%.\r\n\r\nThis will be implemented when the Government restores the\r\n\r\ntargeted  CPF  contributions.  The Deputy Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  assured us that this will not likely to happen until\r\n\r\n2-4  years  later.  The rationale for  the  move  was  to\r\n\r\nassist workers in this age bracket, as they are viewed to\r\n\r\nbe  at  greater risk of being retrenched, but  will  also\r\n\r\nhave  more difficulty of finding work at their last drawn\r\n\r\npay.  I beg to differ.  The proposed reduction alone will\r\n\r\nnot  achieve its good intention of retaining jobs for the\r\n\r\n50-55-year old workers.  Workers in this age bracket will\r\n\r\nhave  to  change their mindset in order not  to  be  left\r\n\r\nbehind in a changing business and social environment.  In\r\n\r\nthis  respect, I hope that the Government will  speed  up\r\n\r\nits  efforts in retraining this group of people, such  as\r\n\r\nin the Skills Redevelopment Programme and the People-for-Job  Traineeship  Programme.  Moreover, the  decrease  in\r\n\r\nemployee's contribution from 20% to 16%  eventually  will\r\n\r\nmean  less CPF savings and a higher income tax  bill  for\r\n\r\nhigh-income  earners.  This may lead to employees  asking\r\n\r\nfor  lower  monthly salary with a higher year end  bonus.\r\n\r\nThis   is   because  bonuses  have  no  limits   in   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  as long as total CPF contributions  do  not\r\n\r\nexceed  40% of total income for the year.  If this  trend\r\n\r\ncatches  on,  then  the change in contribution  rate  for\r\n\r\nthose in the 50-55 year brackets to 32% will not make any\r\n\r\ndifference to this class of people, thus neutralising the\r\n\r\neffect of changes to CPF contribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support wholeheartedly the recent\r\n\r\nchanges by the Government to mark the broad path  to  CPF\r\n\r\nrate in the future by introducing fine adjustments to the\r\n\r\nsystem,  rather than drastic changes, allowing  a  stable\r\n\r\ntransition  from a high asset based savings fund  to  one\r\n\r\nthat has a wider investment base that will keep pace with\r\n\r\ninflation and achieve a higher liquidity ratio.  We  must\r\n\r\nbe prudent in our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvestment  and not allow a high dependency to  occur  in\r\n\r\nany one class of assets.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, for allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to raise two\r\n\r\nconcerns about the proposed CPF changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to urge the Government to stop\r\n\r\nmaking micro decisions for Singaporeans.  Whether workers\r\n\r\nbetween  50  and 55 get 16% or 20% CPF contribution  from\r\n\r\nemployers  is  something  that  should  be  decided  upon\r\n\r\nbetween the employers and the employees.  Why should  the\r\n\r\nGovernment make a blanket assessment and decide for  all?\r\n\r\nThere  could be employers out there who are still  highly\r\n\r\nprofitable  and want to reward some of their more  valued\r\n\r\nolder  workers with a higher contribution  rate  of  20%.\r\n\r\nSo,  instead of capping it at 16% for workers between  50\r\n\r\nand  55, and even lower for those who are older, let them\r\n\r\n-  the  employees  -  negotiate with their  firms  for  a\r\n\r\ncontribution rate in the range that is agreeable to  both\r\n\r\nparties.  Should the Government not let go and stop micro\r\n\r\nmanaging  for  its  citizens?  Empower  Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\ntheir  companies to improve their negotiation skills  and\r\n\r\ntake  more  responsibility for  their  own  future.   Why\r\n\r\nshould the Government interfere in this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, if some employers and higher-income employees\r\n\r\nare  willing to stay at the $6,000 contribution rate, why\r\n\r\nshould  the Government force them and legislate to  lower\r\n\r\nthe  maximum rate to $5,000?  Please leave this  decision\r\n\r\nto  them.   We are a developed economy.  Our high  income\r\n\r\nearners  are  not there by coincidence.   They  have  the\r\n\r\nintellectual capacity and maturity to decide how to  save\r\n\r\nand  what to spend on.  Give those higher-income  earners\r\n\r\nthe  personal choice.  Empower them to plan for their own\r\n\r\nretirement savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to express support\r\n\r\nfor  the  limits  on  the use of CPF funds  for  property\r\n\r\ninvestment.   As a society, our savings are very  heavily\r\n\r\ninvested in property.  This is a very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunhealthy misallocation of our scarce resources.  Can the\r\n\r\nMinister  tell us, as a nation, what is the total  amount\r\n\r\nof  money  committed to property?  I suspect it could  be\r\n\r\nnear a few hundred billion dollars.  Therefore, a 1% drop\r\n\r\nin  value  is going to wipe out billions from  our  asset\r\n\r\nvalue.  The Government in aggressively promoting its home\r\n\r\nownership  policy has made Singapore very expensive.   It\r\n\r\nall  started when CPF was freed up for property purchases\r\n\r\nin  the early 90s.  So, it is a good thing that the  sub-committee is addressing this issue of over-investing  our\r\n\r\nhard  earned  CPF money into property.  However,  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  120% target over the next five  years  is  not\r\n\r\naggressive  enough.  The Government should be bolder  and\r\n\r\nreduce  it  to below 100% in the long term.   Having  too\r\n\r\nmuch  of our assets tied up in property is going to  cost\r\n\r\nretirement    problems   for   our   aging    population.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who think that they can retire  comfortably\r\n\r\nby  selling  or downgrading their expensive property  for\r\n\r\nprofits   or  cash  should  seriously  reconsider   their\r\n\r\nretirement strategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that property prices are determined by\r\n\r\nsupply  and demand.  Assuming limited supply, prices  can\r\n\r\nonly  go  up  if  there  is a constant  high  demand  for\r\n\r\nproperty  for  the next few decades.  But where  is  this\r\n\r\ndemand  going  to  come  from?   If  we  fail  to  remake\r\n\r\nSingapore   from   an  investment  to  an  innovation-led\r\n\r\neconomy, if our economy wavers and growth declines due to\r\n\r\nour  inherent  high cost, then, we are going  to  see  an\r\n\r\nexodus  of  citizens and international  talents  to  more\r\n\r\nattractive  cities to work and live.  If  and  when  that\r\n\r\nhappens,  our property values will plummet, and  this  is\r\n\r\ngoing to create economic hardship and more bankruptcy for\r\n\r\nour  citizens.   Those  citizens  who  rely  heavily   on\r\n\r\nproperty assets as a means of retirement are going to  be\r\n\r\nhardest  hit.   Therefore,  I  would  like  to  urge  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review  Committee  to  look  more  boldly   and\r\n\r\ncreatively into how this problem can be prevented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than these two concerns, I support the other\r\n\r\nchanges as presented.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice  (Mr  Matthias  Yao Chih):   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsupport the changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, I heard a most painful story, and I want\r\n\r\nto  share  this with the House.  This is an interview  on\r\n\r\nBBC  radio, and the interview was with a woman,  and  she\r\n\r\nwas  from  Argentina.   As  we  know,  Argentina  is   in\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis;  peso has gone  down  in  value;  five\r\n\r\nchanges  of President in 12 days, and so on.  This  woman\r\n\r\nwho  was  interviewed had a tailoring shop which  failed.\r\n\r\nAnd  all she had left were two pairs of scissors.   Every\r\n\r\nday, she goes to the town square to sell her body to earn\r\n\r\nsome  money.   She  is 60 years old.   According  to  the\r\n\r\ninterviewer,  the reporter, this is not uncommon  in  the\r\n\r\ncity and in other parts of Argentina.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is pain, and I hope that we will never see that\r\n\r\nkind  of  pain in Singapore.  And to avoid big  pain,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to make small changes, incur small pains.  When  we\r\n\r\ntighten  our  girders, when we chop off the loose  parts,\r\n\r\nwhen  we tie up the shaky bits, there will be some  pain.\r\n\r\nI  think  Singaporeans will understand enough  to  accept\r\n\r\nsmall pains when they come to avoid the big pain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC is doing a lot of work. There are seven sub-committees, and they are all busy studying various\r\n\r\nsubject  areas.   There  are  working  groups  and   sub-committees and many consultation processes going on.   My\r\n\r\nwish  was  that the entire ERC report comes  out  in  its\r\n\r\nentirety  and then we can see the whole picture of  where\r\n\r\nwe want to go and how we want to go about achieving that.\r\n\r\nBut,  unfortunately,  some things are  more  urgent  than\r\n\r\nothers  and  we  have to make the announcements  as  they\r\n\r\ncome.   So,  we announced the tax changes, and today  the\r\n\r\nDPM  announced  the Government's acceptance  of  the  CPF\r\n\r\nchanges.   Both are urgent, and both will have  long-term\r\n\r\nimplications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last week, I was talking to a French\r\n\r\nbusinessman who is stationed in Singapore, and we  talked\r\n\r\nabout  the  tax  changes.  And  he  said  that  he  loves\r\n\r\nSingapore and he wants to live here and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwork  here, but his operation in Singapore is very small.\r\n\r\nMost  of  the business is done from another country  with\r\n\r\nother  countries in the region.  But because of  the  tax\r\n\r\nchanges,  he is considering very seriously to  bring  the\r\n\r\nbulk  of  his  business into Singapore and  be  based  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  to  be  reported in Singapore  and,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  to be taxed in Singapore.  We  will  create\r\n\r\nmore jobs and we will collect more tax from his company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, just two months after the announcement,\r\n\r\nimmediately  we  see  this  kind  of  reaction  from  the\r\n\r\nbusiness community.  And I hope that more companies  will\r\n\r\nconsider the tax changes in such a positive way and  make\r\n\r\nthose  decisions  that are critical  to  our  future  job\r\n\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the CPF changes, we have conducted more than 10\r\n\r\ndialogue sessions, big and small, with our union leaders.\r\n\r\nBy  and  large, union leaders support the thrust  of  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations, which is to re-focus the CPF system back\r\n\r\nto  its  basics  for  retirement expenditure,  for  basic\r\n\r\nhousing  and for medical care.  But, Sir, by no means  is\r\n\r\nthe  agreement  unanimous  as  far  as  the  details  are\r\n\r\nconcerned.  Naturally, when there is pain, people  react.\r\n\r\nSome  union leaders were very concerned especially  about\r\n\r\nthe freeze of the employer's CPF contribution.  Some were\r\n\r\nangry.   Many of them argued the same points that  Assoc.\r\n\r\nProf.  Low  Seow  Chay argued, perhaps less  passionately\r\n\r\nthan  him,  but making essentially similar points.   Some\r\n\r\neven  got  angry  with NTUC leaders and  said  that  NTUC\r\n\r\nshould  be  the first to ask for wage increases  and  not\r\n\r\nwage cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, to do nothing is to be irresponsible.\r\n\r\nAmong   the  trade  unions,  we  collect  statistics   of\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers.  Let me share one set of  statistics\r\n\r\nwhich  is very alarming to us, and this covered the  last\r\n\r\nfour  quarters.  In the second quarter of last year  when\r\n\r\nwe  were in recession, those who were retrenched from the\r\n\r\nunionised companies, who were above 50 years old, was 10%\r\n\r\none  year ago.  For the second quarter of this year,  one\r\n\r\nyear  later, and we are seeing a pick-up in the  economy,\r\n\r\nthose who were retrenched and above 50 years\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nold  have gone up from 10% to 25%.  Let us bring the  age\r\n\r\nlower,  down  to  age  40,  and  four  quarters  ago  the\r\n\r\npercentage  of  those retrenched above 40 years  old  was\r\n\r\n35%,  about a third.  In the second quarter of this year,\r\n\r\nit  has gone up to 59%.  So, workers above 40 this  year,\r\n\r\nas  a proportion of all workers retrenched from unionised\r\n\r\ncompanies,  have gone up now to 59%, from 35% last  year.\r\n\r\nAnd I puzzle over this.  Why is this so?  We are supposed\r\n\r\nto  be  in a recovery.  The reason, I guess, and  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to do more research on this, is that last year,  in\r\n\r\na recession, companies folded.  So when a company closes,\r\n\r\nthe  whole  workforce goes, young and  old.   This  year,\r\n\r\nthings  are  different.  The economy is picking  up,  but\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  still  retrenching.   And  they  retrench\r\n\r\nbecause   they   merge,  because  they  outsource,   they\r\n\r\nrestructure,  they downsize, but they do  not  close  the\r\n\r\nwhole  company.   The  retrenchment is  selective,  small\r\n\r\ndepartments here and there.  When the company  retrenches\r\n\r\nselectively,  it is the oldest workers who are  the  most\r\n\r\nvulnerable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when we see this kind of trend, naturally we are\r\n\r\nalarmed.   And the better the economy, the  worse  it  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be.   As  China opens up  and  more  companies\r\n\r\nrelocate  away from South East Asia, including Singapore,\r\n\r\ninto  China, and as the rest of ASEAN countries pick  up,\r\n\r\nmore and more companies will outsource or restructure and\r\n\r\nshift  part of their operations out of Singapore.   There\r\n\r\nwill be more selective retrenchments.  Hence, we need  to\r\n\r\ndo  something for our workers who are aged 50 and  above,\r\n\r\nor even 40 and above.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we explained this to union leaders, at least in\r\n\r\ntheir  heads  they can understand, even though  in  their\r\n\r\nhearts they feel very concerned about the effect of a CPF\r\n\r\nfreeze  on  the older workers.  But they understand  that\r\n\r\nthe  key  problem  is  really  the  seniority-based  wage\r\n\r\nsystem,  and  it was the unions that have  been  pressing\r\n\r\nemployers  to  do something about it.  And  as  early  as\r\n\r\n1986, Mr Lim Boon Heng already mooted the idea of a base-up  wage  system to bring the wage gap between the  older\r\n\r\nworkers and the younger workers closer, so that the older\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers  will not face this problem.  And come the  Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis, the same thing happened and NTUC  came\r\n\r\nback  to  urge  employers to apply or  implement  a  wage\r\n\r\nsystem that is more base-up, rather than seniority-based.\r\n\r\nEmployers  are  very slow to apply or  to  implement  the\r\n\r\nmeasure.   The NWC, last year, called again  for  base-up\r\n\r\nsystem.  Again, things are not moving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So really, we have to get to the key of the problem.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  seniority-based wage system  is  not  a  common\r\n\r\nsystem  in  the  world.   Over the  last  two  weeks,  my\r\n\r\nofficers   in  the  international  department   contacted\r\n\r\nvarious  trade union counterparts all over the  world  to\r\n\r\nfind out what their system is.  So we did a quick survey,\r\n\r\nnot  a  scientific  one, but a rough  one.   In  the  US,\r\n\r\nCanada,  Italy, Germany and France, they are all paid  by\r\n\r\njob  rate.   This  is a job, this is  how  much  we  pay,\r\n\r\nwhether you are a man or a woman, young or old worker, it\r\n\r\nis  the  same rate.  When there is an increase in salary,\r\n\r\neverybody gets the same.  A fresh recruit comes in  at  a\r\n\r\ncertain  salary because he is new, there  is  a  learning\r\n\r\ncurve.  Within two or three years maximum, he reaches the\r\n\r\ntop  of  the scale, and he continues there.  Even  if  he\r\n\r\ncontinues to work for 20 years, he is paid for  the  job.\r\n\r\nHe is not paid for how many years he stays in a company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan and Korea are the opposite. They have\r\n\r\nseniority-based  system and see how  difficult  the  wage\r\n\r\nsystem is, how painful it is for their workers who  enjoy\r\n\r\nlifelong employment with very high salaries as they  grow\r\n\r\nolder,  how  difficult it is to retrench and to  downsize\r\n\r\ntheir companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to do something quick. The retraining\r\n\r\nprogrammes, the job assistance programmes, they take time\r\n\r\nto  kick in.  A worker needs time to be retrained and  to\r\n\r\nfind reemployment.  But, immediately, what we want to  do\r\n\r\nis  to  keep them in their jobs as far as possible.   And\r\n\r\ntherefore,   NTUC  supports  the  freeze   of   the   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  for older workers.  But at the  same  time,\r\n\r\nthe real issue is not the CPF, and the long-term solution\r\n\r\nis not in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCPF.   The employers must now do their part to also  help\r\n\r\nrestructure  our wage system.  This cannot be  driven  by\r\n\r\nthe  unions and the workers.  The employers must do their\r\n\r\npart.   They must address the wage system so that all  of\r\n\r\nus can benefit from it and have a more competitive labour\r\n\r\nand wage structure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some employers have dismissed the CPF freeze and\r\n\r\nsaid  that  it is not effective.  Some MPs in this  House\r\n\r\ntoo  have  dismissed it as ineffective.  Then the  answer\r\n\r\nis,  if it is not effective, give it back to the workers.\r\n\r\nIt  is  very simple - put it back as a bonus, or MVC,  or\r\n\r\nwhatever  allowance.   There is no need  to  argue  about\r\n\r\nthis.   The Singapore Technologies has come out  with  an\r\n\r\nannouncement.   I  thank  them,  and  I  hope  that  more\r\n\r\nemployers  will publicly make a statement and follow  the\r\n\r\nexamples of Singapore Technologies and the civil  service\r\n\r\nand put back whatever they think is not effective, in the\r\n\r\nfirst place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we should all take a step back and look\r\n\r\nat  the  broader picture and, today, we are just  talking\r\n\r\nabout  CPF.   We talked about the taxes in  the  previous\r\n\r\nsession.   As the other announcements are made  from  the\r\n\r\nERC  committees,  we should look at the  larger  picture.\r\n\r\nToday,  we  have 14 recommendations, but most of  us  are\r\n\r\nfocused  on  the  CPF freeze for older  workers  and  the\r\n\r\nproperty.   But  there  are more important  huge  changes\r\n\r\nwhich   deserve   much  more  attention,   for   example,\r\n\r\nmanagement of the pension funds.  If every worker can get\r\n\r\none more percentage point from his savings, over 35 years\r\n\r\nin  his  career, that will compound to a  lot  of  money.\r\n\r\nThat  deserves  a lot of discussion.  We should  be  much\r\n\r\nmore  curious  how it might work and get more  people  to\r\n\r\ntalk  about it and get the financial institutions to make\r\n\r\nproposals and let us look at this.  Because it is not  so\r\n\r\nimportant  about how we invest our funds in  unit  trusts\r\n\r\nand  shares,  and so on.  If there is a properly  managed\r\n\r\nfund that can give us a slightly better return compounded\r\n\r\nover  many  years, it will make a real big difference  to\r\n\r\nour workers' savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as we look back at the CPF changes, we should\r\n\r\nnot be fixated on any single\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecommendation.   We have brought the refocusing  of  the\r\n\r\nCPF  back  to  its basics.  But perhaps, Sir,  more  than\r\n\r\nrefocusing, it is really a re-balancing of the CPF system\r\n\r\nso  that we get out of a trap of being asset-rich,  cash-poor into a more balanced situation where the three basic\r\n\r\nneeds are equally well looked after.  And if the proposal\r\n\r\nworks  here,  and  I am sure they will  work,  this  will\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our  social safety net for  our  workers  and\r\n\r\nretirees  and,  hopefully,  it  will  also  keep  workers\r\n\r\nworking for as long as possible before they retire.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues  speaking before me have spoken eloquently  on\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  changes.  I should not repeat  what  they  have\r\n\r\nsaid.  But I would like to comment on the part concerning\r\n\r\nchanges on HDB policy that DPM Lee announced earlier.   I\r\n\r\nnotice  that  our  Government is shifting  its  stand  on\r\n\r\nprevious  HDB  policy and I am uncomfortable  about  this\r\n\r\nshift.   Indeed,  I am concerned for fellow  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nover  the  untoward repercussions that  may  arise  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of it.  I shall further elaborate on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has one of the world's highest home-owning\r\n\r\npopulation as a result of the Government's consistent and\r\n\r\nsound  policy over the years.  More importantly,  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen successful in fostering cohesive communities amongst\r\n\r\nSingaporeans through HDB housing.  And, over  the  years,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  relied on the PAP Government  as  the\r\n\r\nprovider  for their basic necessity of having roofs  over\r\n\r\ntheir heads.  They have rested their trust and confidence\r\n\r\non  the  Government  and they have peace  of  mind.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  has enabled  the  people  to  enjoy\r\n\r\naffordable  and  hassle-free  housing  needs.   This  had\r\n\r\ntranslated to the people's support for the PAP  at  every\r\n\r\nelection.   Sir, our HDB policy has been sound all  these\r\n\r\nyears and my question is: why fix it if it ain't broke?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have my reservations on new HDB buyers who, being\r\n\r\nineligible for subsidised loans, have now to borrow  from\r\n\r\nthe  private banks rather than the HDB itself.   Allowing\r\n\r\nhome owners to get better\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarket  interest rates from the private banks  is  not  a\r\n\r\nsound  reason here because the interest rates charged  by\r\n\r\nthe  private banks may be better only for the  first,  or\r\n\r\nsecond, year and subsequent years may work out to be more\r\n\r\nthan  the HDB's interest rate.  The market interest  rate\r\n\r\nfor  banks  now  is 2.8% compared with the  HDB's  3.75%.\r\n\r\nHowever,  HDB's interest rate may not be  more  than  the\r\n\r\nprivate  banks  for too long as the HDB  market  rate  on\r\n\r\nmortgage  loans is pegged to the housing loan rates  that\r\n\r\nDBS  Bank  charges  mortgagors.  As  and  when  DBS  Bank\r\n\r\nadjusts  its  housing loan rate to these mortgagors,  the\r\n\r\nHDB  market  rate will also be revised.   The  attractive\r\n\r\nfirst  and second year interest rates offered by  private\r\n\r\nbanks  may  be short-lived during this economic  downturn\r\n\r\ndue  to the fact that banks are flushed with funds at the\r\n\r\nmoment.  The interest rates offered by private banks  may\r\n\r\nbe  lower  than  HDB's rate now but they had  hovered  at\r\n\r\naround 6% for the last decade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new policy, many new HDB buyers are forced\r\n\r\nto  hunt  around for banks to borrow money for their  HDB\r\n\r\nflats.  They also have to be wary on terms and conditions\r\n\r\nof  the  different banks on top of the different interest\r\n\r\nrates  offered  by different banks.  I am  concerned  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  may  be less savvy on this.   They  may  have\r\n\r\ntrouble  looking for loans and they may even end up  with\r\n\r\nunfavourable   loan   terms.   This   is   definitely   a\r\n\r\ndisadvantage  compared  to the previous  hassle-free  HDB\r\n\r\nloan application.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new ruling will also make it more difficult for\r\n\r\nthose who are not eligible for subsidised loan and having\r\n\r\nto   upgrade  or  change  flats  for  whatever   reasons.\r\n\r\nBorrowers  in  the private sectors are  subject  to  loan\r\n\r\ncriteria.  They now not only have to search for loans but\r\n\r\nalso  to  consider their eligibility for the loans.   The\r\n\r\nquantum and the period of repayment of loans will  become\r\n\r\nissues  depending on the income level and the age of  the\r\n\r\nborrowers.   This  new ruling therefore  is  a  hampering\r\n\r\nfactor for many in the group of people who have to change\r\n\r\nflats for various reasons and circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.23 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private banks are more stringent with loans and are\r\n\r\nstricter  with compliance of monthly payments.   Foremost\r\n\r\nwith private banks is the interest of their shareholders.\r\n\r\nDefault in payments will usually end up with repossession\r\n\r\nof the flats.  The social role of HDB tends to make it  a\r\n\r\nmore understanding financier, that is, more forgiving  of\r\n\r\ndefaulters.  The HDB is more willing to offer  assistance\r\n\r\nand  alternative payment methods to ease  the  burden  of\r\n\r\npeople   in  difficulty.   It  is  a  fact  that  several\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance measures are readily available  for\r\n\r\nsold  HDB  flats.   These include the extension  of  loan\r\n\r\nrepayment  period  scheme, reduced repayment  scheme  and\r\n\r\ndeferment  of  mortgage loan instalment  payment  scheme.\r\n\r\nThe  HDB  is also more sensitive to the plight of  people\r\n\r\nduring  economic  downturns,  such  as  this  one.    For\r\n\r\nexample, HDB announced last month on the revised  reduced\r\n\r\nrepayment  scheme to further help those in difficulty  in\r\n\r\nloan repayment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, private banks do not have such readily\r\n\r\navailable schemes and may not want to offer such  schemes\r\n\r\nto those in difficulty.  Prices of property may fluctuate\r\n\r\nand  banks have known to reassess housing loans in tandem\r\n\r\nwith   this   fluctuation.   There  is  a   saying   that\r\n\r\n\"commercial banks tend to give you an umbrella when it is\r\n\r\nsunny,  only to take it back when it rains\".  There  were\r\n\r\nmany  instances of banks recalling bank loans during  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis of 1997.  Although HDB flat prices  may\r\n\r\nnot  fluctuate as much as private property prices,  banks\r\n\r\nmay still call for top-ups if HDB flat prices drop.  This\r\n\r\nwill  hit  a  lot  of  HDB  flat borrowers,  the  average\r\n\r\nSingaporean  heartlanders, real hard as  property  prices\r\n\r\nusually fall during economic downturns.  The other  worry\r\n\r\nis  that  since  banks  always  consider  the  tenure  of\r\n\r\nproperties for mortgage, those HDB flats with  less  than\r\n\r\n99-year lease will be less favourable to them.  This  may\r\n\r\nresult in a drop in prices of older HDB flats\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  may, therefore, affect the whole HDB resale  market.\r\n\r\nHow   will   the  Government  prevent  this   undesirable\r\n\r\nconsequence?  I am also concerned with the fact that  the\r\n\r\nbank  will have first, and the CPF second, claim  to  the\r\n\r\nmortgaged  HDB  property during forced sales  in  default\r\n\r\nsituations.  This is disadvantageous to the home  owners.\r\n\r\nCPF  is  the most important saving of the people, and  it\r\n\r\nworries me that people may lose their savings should they\r\n\r\nbe  unable  to service their housing loans.   Banks  will\r\n\r\nsell   the   flats  under  mortgagee  sales  in   default\r\n\r\nsituations,  ending up with less than favourable  prices.\r\n\r\nThus, the HDB owners will invariably lose the CPF part of\r\n\r\ntheir  money.  These unfortunate people also end up  with\r\n\r\nno  roofs  over  their heads.  How  do  we  address  such\r\n\r\nsituations?  Do we have enough HDB rental flats to  house\r\n\r\nthese  people?   Does the Government have  any  plans  to\r\n\r\nbuild  more  HDB  rental flats in  anticipation  of  such\r\n\r\nsituations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues in this House would agree with me that\r\n\r\nmany  of us had appealed to HDB and succeeded in allowing\r\n\r\nmany  defaulters  to  settle arrears  by  instalments  or\r\n\r\ndeferment  of  mortgage loans and so on.  MPs  cannot  be\r\n\r\nappealing to the private sector financiers.  How  do  MPs\r\n\r\nhelp  such defaulters then?  I can therefore see  one  of\r\n\r\nthe useful roles of MPs being eroded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask DPM Lee whether one of the CPF\r\n\r\nproposals  on  the 120% cap on withdrawal limit  may  run\r\n\r\ncontradictory to the aim of discouraging over-investment,\r\n\r\nas  buyers  may go for properties with higher  values  to\r\n\r\nmake sure that the valuation cap is not breached.  How do\r\n\r\nwe   overcome  this  and  encourage  people  to  consider\r\n\r\naffordability issues and not to over stretch themselves?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new HDB policy may compel people to think\r\n\r\nvery  carefully in committing to a property within  their\r\n\r\nmeans    and    would   therefore   enhance    individual\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  However, I feel that the implications  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier are too big a price to pay  for  this.\r\n\r\nThe  resultant repercussions, when unforeseeable  tragedy\r\n\r\nhits,  will  be great distress to many Singaporeans.   We\r\n\r\nmay argue that there is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneed to restructure and revamp to move forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel that there are\r\n\r\ncertain  policies that are part of the obligations  of  a\r\n\r\ngood  government,  and  even if  a  policy  may  be  less\r\n\r\nadvantageous  to  the  Government,  as  long  as  it   is\r\n\r\nbeneficial to the people, the policy must remain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I support the Government's acceptance  of\r\n\r\nthe  ERC's recommendation to make changes to the existing\r\n\r\nCPF system.  This will reaffirm CPF three major functions\r\n\r\nas  retirement  fund, medical expense and  housing  need.\r\n\r\nBut  on the proposal to reduce the CPF contribution  rate\r\n\r\nfor  workers aged between 50 and 55, I feel  there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed for further deliberation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Lee has explained that the\r\n\r\nreason  for  this measure is to enhance the employability\r\n\r\nof  this group of people.  But I feel that using the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate  alone  to  tackle  this  problem   is\r\n\r\ntreating just the symptom but not the cause. Why do I say\r\n\r\nthis? This is because the low employment rate, relatively\r\n\r\nfewer   chances   of  employment  and  higher   risk   of\r\n\r\nretenchment  for  these  people are  mainly  due  to  the\r\n\r\nseniority-based  wage system in Singapore.   Mr  Matthias\r\n\r\nYao  has  already explained this in detail.  I  will  not\r\n\r\nrepeat it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that if we use just the CPF alone,\r\n\r\nbefore we could reap the benefits we will suffer the ill-effects first.  This is because the older people who  are\r\n\r\ncurrently employed will automatically lose part of  their\r\n\r\nwages.   Although the Government has taken  the  lead  in\r\n\r\nannouncing that it would pass on this part of the savings\r\n\r\nfrom  the wage cost to the civil servants under the  TCTC\r\n\r\nscheme, and Singapore Technologies has also responded  to\r\n\r\nthis  call, we cannot ensure that all the private  sector\r\n\r\nemployers   and  enterprises  will  follow  suit.    Some\r\n\r\nemployers will say, \"The Government is asking us  to  cut\r\n\r\nthe CPF contribution to help us save on labour cost\", and\r\n\r\nthen conveniently pocket the savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there is no guarantee that the\r\n\r\nlowering  of  CPF  contribution  rate  will  enhance  the\r\n\r\nemployability of the workers in this age group.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  if  the employer feels that the skill  level  or\r\n\r\nwork  attitude of the said employee is not  good  enough,\r\n\r\nthe  saving  of  4% CPF contribution will not  be  enough\r\n\r\nincentive  for  him to change his mind. Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\nlowering  of  CPF  rates for this group of  workers  runs\r\n\r\ncontrary to our intention to promote \"equal pay for equal\r\n\r\nwork\".  From the perspective of the employers, they  will\r\n\r\nfeel   that,  after  all,  the  Government  is  adjusting\r\n\r\ndownwards the labour cost from the age of 50 onwards, why\r\n\r\nshould they bother to promote the practice of \"equal  pay\r\n\r\nfor equal work\".  From the employees' point of view, they\r\n\r\nwill  also refuse to accept this equal-pay-for-equal-work\r\n\r\nsystem   because  they  are  being  paid  a   lower   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution.   Otherwise, they  would  be  hit  at  both\r\n\r\nfronts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel that the lowering of CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate for older workers  will    hinder  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of an equal-pay-for-equal-work  scheme.   I\r\n\r\nthink  a  more positive way of resolving this problem  of\r\n\r\nemployability  of  older workers  is  to  accelerate  the\r\n\r\nabolition of the seniority-based wage system through  our\r\n\r\ntripartite  cooperation mechanism.  We must work  through\r\n\r\nthe  public education system to change the mindset of the\r\n\r\npeople  in order to help establish and promote the equal-pay-for-equal-work system.  With the new wage system, our\r\n\r\npeople  will  be more willing to accept skills  upgrading\r\n\r\nand  retraining,  as  well as to adopt  a  pragmatic  and\r\n\r\nrealistic pay expectation. This is the way to enhance the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness of our labour market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Government's\r\n\r\nstand on the proposed CPF adjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I would like, first, to commend the ERC Sub-Committee,  led  by  Mr  Tharman Shanmugaratnam  and  his\r\n\r\nassociated  working  groups, for recommending  such  bold\r\n\r\nchanges  to  the CPF system in the light  of  social  and\r\n\r\neconomic changes and,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nparticularly,   imminent  changes   to   our   population\r\n\r\ndemographics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the current CPF system still fundamentally\r\n\r\nserves  its  purpose, it is imperative  that  we  address\r\n\r\nwhatever   shortcomings  or  whatever  that  has   become\r\n\r\nirrelevant in the current system at this juncture, taking\r\n\r\ninto  consideration the demographic shifts,  our  rapidly\r\n\r\naging  population and the uncertainties ahead of  us.   A\r\n\r\nmore delicate balance needs to be struck to cater to  the\r\n\r\nthree key needs of retirement expenditure, healthcare and\r\n\r\nhome  ownership,  which represent the  core  elements  of\r\n\r\nfinancial security, while also paying close attention  to\r\n\r\nthe employability needs of our middle-aged workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus on two issues. First, on the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  for lower CPF contributions  for  workers\r\n\r\naged  50-55 and, second, on limiting CPF withdrawals  for\r\n\r\nhousing loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern for the employability of our middle-aged\r\n\r\nworkers  was in fact first expressed in my maiden  speech\r\n\r\nin  this  House  in  June 1997.  Having  experienced  the\r\n\r\nstrains and difficulties my family went through during my\r\n\r\nyounger days, when my late father lost his job and  could\r\n\r\nnot find another one for more than a year, I realised how\r\n\r\nimportant  it  is  to keep family breadwinners  employed.\r\n\r\nRecognising then the rigidity of our seniority-based wage\r\n\r\nsystem,  I  had  then mooted the idea of a more  flexible\r\n\r\nwage system for older workers which plateaus at a certain\r\n\r\npoint of a worker's age, and then gradually declines over\r\n\r\ntime,  so that their wages are more linked to skills  and\r\n\r\nproductivity.  This is to ensure that older  workers  are\r\n\r\nnot  at  risk  of  being first on  the  line  when  their\r\n\r\ncompanies downsize or right-size.  Unfortunately, no  one\r\n\r\ntook  me  seriously at that time.  In  fact,  some  union\r\n\r\nleaders  wondered who this \"NKOB\" or new-kid-on-the-block\r\n\r\nwas  up  to.  Today, it is an acknowledged fact that  our\r\n\r\nseniority-based  wage system is more pronounced  than  in\r\n\r\nother  countries.  As the saying goes, there is  no  such\r\n\r\nthing as a free lunch.  Ask any businessman.  With labour\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncost   forming  a  large  chunk  of  business  costs   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   especially   in   manufacturing   companies,\r\n\r\noverpaid  workers will be the first targets in a cut-back\r\n\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, support the proposal to keep\r\n\r\nemployers' CPF contribution rate at the present 16% level\r\n\r\nfor  those  in the 50-55 age group, even as the  rate  is\r\n\r\ngradually  restored  to 20%.  This will  inevitably  make\r\n\r\nthis  group of workers unhappy.  But we must be pragmatic\r\n\r\nto  preserve the employability of this group of  workers.\r\n\r\nI  see this not only as another step in unlocking some of\r\n\r\nthe  rigidities  in our labour market, but  also  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant step.  11%, or 12,100 of the 110,000 workers in\r\n\r\nthis age group, are already unemployed currently and  are\r\n\r\nhaving  difficulty finding new jobs.   Mr  Matthias  Yao,\r\n\r\nDeputy Secretary General of NTUC, has just disclosed  the\r\n\r\ngrim statistics a moment ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutorily bringing down the employers' CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution,  in  conjunction  with  a  slew  of   other\r\n\r\nmeasures,  especially  retraining and  skills  upgrading,\r\n\r\nwill help in retaining jobs.  It is undoubtedly better to\r\n\r\nretain one's job with slightly lower pay than losing  it,\r\n\r\nespecially in the current economic climate.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nonly  more  difficult  to  get  a  new  job,  but  recent\r\n\r\nstatistics  also show that many unemployed older  workers\r\n\r\nhave  to  settle for jobs which pay much less than  their\r\n\r\nlast drawn wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it must be borne in mind that joblessness, more\r\n\r\nso  than  poverty, causes tremendous strains on families,\r\n\r\nand  robs  us  of role models, usually the  head  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily.   However,  as  Mr Heng Chee  How  has  suggested\r\n\r\nearlier,  it  is  important that the  Government  clearly\r\n\r\nexplains  this  move, that it is done with  the  workers'\r\n\r\ninterests in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the subject of limiting CPF\r\n\r\nwithdrawals for housing loans.  It is important to stress\r\n\r\nthat  the  changes proposed apply only  to  new  property\r\n\r\npurchases  with  non-subsidised  HDB  loans.   The  Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis and the recent economic  downturn  have\r\n\r\nclearly signalled to private property buyers and HDB open\r\n\r\nmarket upgraders that investments in property are not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwithout  risks and pitfalls.  Many who have committed  to\r\n\r\nproperty  purchases during the boom period  before  1997,\r\n\r\nare now finding themselves in a negative equity position.\r\n\r\nWhile  those  who are employed see this  as  a  temporary\r\n\r\npaper  loss,  there  are many Singaporeans,  particularly\r\n\r\nthose   who   have  lost  their  jobs,  who  are   facing\r\n\r\ndifficulties  as a result of their property  investments.\r\n\r\nI know several of my grassroots leaders who have run into\r\n\r\nbig  trouble  because of their belief that investment  in\r\n\r\nproperty  in  Singapore is very safe, and  that  property\r\n\r\nprices  will  never go down, because of our  finite  land\r\n\r\nsupply.   The  property measures to cap CPF  savings  for\r\n\r\nproperty  purchases, therefore, build not only safeguards\r\n\r\nto   prevent  Singaporeans  from  putting  in   excessive\r\n\r\ncommitment   of   their   CPF   savings   into   property\r\n\r\ninvestments, but will also ensure that more is set  aside\r\n\r\nfor  retirement  to  cater to the continually  increasing\r\n\r\nliving standards.  We should prevent ourselves from being\r\n\r\ndubbed a nation where its people are asset-rich and  cash\r\n\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our society matures, it is imperative that each\r\n\r\ncitizen    takes   responsibility   for   his   long-term\r\n\r\ncommitments,  whether  it  is in  property  purchases  or\r\n\r\nsetting  up  a business, consistent with his  income  and\r\n\r\naffordability  levels.  Unless Singaporeans  shift  their\r\n\r\nmindset   to  take  personal  responsibility  for   their\r\n\r\nactions,  it  will  be  difficult for  us  to  evolve  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  culture which  has  been  identified  as\r\n\r\nimperative to our future economic survival and growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I am glad that the various proposals\r\n\r\nof  the Committee, when accepted by the Government,  will\r\n\r\nbe implemented in stages, in line with the restoration of\r\n\r\nthe  employer CPF.  The recommendations serve to  enhance\r\n\r\nthe  long-term  orientation  in  balancing  and  ensuring\r\n\r\nadequacy   for   a  more  sustained  retirement   income,\r\n\r\nfulfilling the needs of increased healthcare cost as  one\r\n\r\nages, while also meeting the needs of home ownership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the proposed changes to the\r\n\r\nCPF scheme as announced by the Deputy Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to\r\n\r\njoin  in the debate on the Ministerial Statement  on  CPF\r\n\r\nand related changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Government's intention in general\r\n\r\nas  enunciated  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  in  his\r\n\r\nstatement.   We know that the CPF is the most  basic  and\r\n\r\nfundamental  savings  institution for  Singaporeans.   It\r\n\r\nallows  us  to  prepare for our retirement,  housing  and\r\n\r\nhealthcare  needs.  It differs in main  from  some  other\r\n\r\nsocial  security  systems principally because  the  money\r\n\r\nthat  goes  in does not get pooled together with  others.\r\n\r\nIt  is not an insurance system.  The money belongs to the\r\n\r\naccount  holder for his use.  He has direct ownership  of\r\n\r\nit.   With that, there is also the sense that the  money,\r\n\r\nwhich is contributed into the account by his employer, is\r\n\r\nrightfully part of his salary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we have liberalised the use of CPF\r\n\r\nfunds.   Singaporeans are now able to ostensibly  enhance\r\n\r\nthe  value  of their funds in their CPF accounts  and  to\r\n\r\nmeet  certain social needs as well.  We were  liberal  in\r\n\r\nallowing  Singaporeans to use their CPF  funds,  for  the\r\n\r\nsubstantial  purchase  value  of  their  properties,  for\r\n\r\ninvestments  in trustee shares, where unfortunately,  for\r\n\r\nmany CPF account holders, I am not sure if they know  the\r\n\r\ndifference  between a share and a bond.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nthe liberal tendency towards the use of CPF funds meant a\r\n\r\nbasic  and  fundamental shift in  looking  at  CPF  as  a\r\n\r\npractically safe and secure savings scheme for old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This raises the question of the amount that one\r\n\r\nneeds  for old age.  At the moment, the Minimum Sum  that\r\n\r\none  needs  to  maintain in his CPF Ordinary  Account  on\r\n\r\nretirement  is  pegged at $80,000  in  the  coming  year.\r\n\r\nWhile  this is a carefully calculated sum, one must  bear\r\n\r\nin  mind  that  what  is  sufficient  is  relative.   For\r\n\r\nSingaporeans generally, one would have thought that  what\r\n\r\nis  sufficient or basic, is a function of the quality and\r\n\r\nstandard  of living and, of course, relative to the  cost\r\n\r\nof  living  then.   To my mind, Sir, it would  seem  that\r\n\r\nthere  would  always be some anxiety that  no  amount  of\r\n\r\nsavings would seem\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nenough to provide for retirement.  One would suppose that\r\n\r\nliberalising  the use of CPF funds for certain  types  of\r\n\r\ninvestments  was meant to enlarge the pool of  retirement\r\n\r\nfunds available for the CPF account holder. This is  well\r\n\r\nand  fine  in  an economic environment where  the  growth\r\n\r\nindicators seem to defy the laws of gravity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, nobody expected the world economy to look\r\n\r\nso  dismal,  neither did anybody expect  property  prices\r\n\r\nhere  ever to head south.  Well, this has happened.   For\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans, this has meant that  there  is  asset\r\n\r\ndeflation  and  with that, a dramatic  reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nvalue of their CPF funds.  The most obvious example would\r\n\r\nbe  the total amount that some Singaporeans pay for their\r\n\r\nresidential  property.  At the end of the  day  this  may\r\n\r\nwell exceed 160% in value.  And for many Singaporeans, it\r\n\r\nwould  also  mean  that  a substantial  amount  of  their\r\n\r\nsavings  could  also  be  wiped out  if  property  prices\r\n\r\ncontinue  to depreciate in value from the height  of  the\r\n\r\nproperty   boom.  This  is  not  to  mention  that   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who use their CPF savings to buy shares  are\r\n\r\nalso badly hit recently because of falling share prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background of a mix of pressing demands\r\n\r\nof  old age, a more liberal and perhaps a more risky  use\r\n\r\nof  CPF funds and an uncertain economic future, there  is\r\n\r\nan even greater need for Singaporeans to save more rather\r\n\r\nthan  less  for old age; which explains why  our  savings\r\n\r\nrate, even at present, is pegged at one of the highest in\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this savings contribution to CPF, at the\r\n\r\nmoment,  coming from both the employer and  employee,  is\r\n\r\nnow  seen as one of the main impediments towards  getting\r\n\r\nSingaporeans employed or to stay employed.   It  is  also\r\n\r\ndepriving many Singaporeans in the lower income band from\r\n\r\nusing  their cash immediately since their money must  now\r\n\r\nbe squirrelled away to their accounts in CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore try to fix the problem, at least for\r\n\r\nthe older Singaporeans in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n50-55 age group category, by getting a relative reduction\r\n\r\nof  the  employer's contribution to 16%.  For the  poorer\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  making less than $500 a month,  we  try  to\r\n\r\nhelp them by not requiring them to put their share of the\r\n\r\ncontribution  to the CPF account.  In other words,  there\r\n\r\nis  no need for them to save for old age, since they  are\r\n\r\nfacing enough difficulties for the moment to think  about\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I can understand where the changes are\r\n\r\ncoming  from, I do have some reservations about them.   I\r\n\r\nshall  touch on two.  Forgive me if I dwell on the  issue\r\n\r\nof CPF contributions of those in the 50-55 age group.   I\r\n\r\nwould  also  touch  on  the CPF contributions  of  poorer\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the CPF contributions for the older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in that category.  The underlying  rationale\r\n\r\non  the reduction of CPF contribution is to enable  older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to become more employable, either in getting\r\n\r\nemployed  or  staying employed.  What the revisions  will\r\n\r\nlead  to  ultimately is that when CPF contribution  rates\r\n\r\nare revised upwards, there will be no change for those in\r\n\r\nthat age group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do have reservations about tweaking with CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate  even  if the  underlying  concern  is\r\n\r\nemployment among older Singaporeans. When we started  the\r\n\r\nCPF  system for Singaporeans, it was, as I understand it,\r\n\r\nmeant  to  deal  with an issue that the market  will  not\r\n\r\nresolve  effectively,  and that is getting  employees  to\r\n\r\nsave  for  retirement.  In its implementation, therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  system was generally applied across the  board,\r\n\r\nirrespective of age, physical ability or gender.  We have\r\n\r\nacknowledged that the CPF, as a pension system, or  as  a\r\n\r\nsocial  safety net, has worked fairly well to-date.   For\r\n\r\none,  there  is  certainty in the wage  outlay  for  both\r\n\r\nemployers and employees.  Presently, the CEOs, the  human\r\n\r\nresource managers and financial controllers calculate the\r\n\r\ntotal  wage bill of the organisation in relation also  to\r\n\r\nthe  rate  that they have to contribute to CPF. Decisions\r\n\r\nto  employ  any  employee are left very  much  to  market\r\n\r\nforces.   Often  the  question to hire  any  employee  is\r\n\r\ndependent on the ability of the person concerned and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhis asking wages.  Again, the decision whether or not  to\r\n\r\nkeep  any  employee on the payroll is determined  by  his\r\n\r\ncontribution to the company and his cost to the  company.\r\n\r\nMarket forces leave the question of the amount to be paid\r\n\r\nas  wages  to the parties to negotiate.  In the  case  of\r\n\r\nthose who are already employed, in as much as salaries go\r\n\r\nup,  salaries  must also be reduced if that  is  what  it\r\n\r\ntakes  to  keep  employment.   Often,  CPF  contributions\r\n\r\nmerely provide the framework within which negotiation  of\r\n\r\nwages takes place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must realise that by tweaking with the\r\n\r\npresent  system, we are, in effect, moving from  that  of\r\n\r\nfacilitating   the   operation  of   market   forces   to\r\n\r\nintroducing elements that would directly impinge  on  the\r\n\r\noperation  of market forces itself.  In other words,  the\r\n\r\nchange  in  policy would hopefully lead to  making  older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans more attractive to the employer. What we are\r\n\r\ndoing  is,  in  my  opinion, no  different  from  setting\r\n\r\nlegislation that requires employers to give reduction  in\r\n\r\nsalary to older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am given to understand that in Singapore, we\r\n\r\nshould,  where  possible,  leave  it  to  the  market  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  the supply of goods and services.  Legislative\r\n\r\nintervention should not be introduced in the  marketplace\r\n\r\nif  possible and should be put in place only where market\r\n\r\nforces fail.  It is for this reason that we have resisted\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of minimum wages in our legislation,  lest  an\r\n\r\ninefficient   and  imperfect  market  be  created.    The\r\n\r\ninstitution of the CPF is to compel savings and not as an\r\n\r\ninducement  to hire any particular group.   By  adjusting\r\n\r\nthe  contribution rate of the elderly,  we  have  made  a\r\n\r\nfundamental shift, fundamental in a sense that  we  have,\r\n\r\nby  legislation,  set wage levels to induce  hiring.   If\r\n\r\ntrue,  if  I  may  ask, are we going back  on  the  basic\r\n\r\neconomic  principle of using the marketplace to determine\r\n\r\nthe level of supply and demand?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as was originally put, the concern was getting\r\n\r\nolder  Singaporean workers to gain employment or to  stay\r\n\r\nemployed, surely the approach could well have been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  encourage  older  workers to  accept  lower  starting\r\n\r\nsalaries  or to accept lower wages, if that  is  what  it\r\n\r\ntakes  to  keep  them employed.  Having a  culture  where\r\n\r\nolder  workers  are prepared to lower their  wages  to  a\r\n\r\nlevel that meets the demand at the marketplace would,  to\r\n\r\nmy  mind,  be  a more realistic approach towards  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  the issue of the unemployed middle-aged.  Like many\r\n\r\nof  my  colleagues before me, I do not think for a moment\r\n\r\nthat  the  4-percentage point reduction on  the  employer\r\n\r\nside is going to make much of a difference in helping the\r\n\r\nemployer  decide on the issue.  Neither will the  savings\r\n\r\nin  CPF  contribution prevent an older worker from  being\r\n\r\nretrenched.  The point is, if you are good, you are good,\r\n\r\nirrespective of age.  Also, if the company's business  is\r\n\r\nfaring  badly, cutting CPF contribution is not  going  to\r\n\r\nmake   a  difference.   And  I  suspect  that  even   the\r\n\r\nGovernment is not sure whether reducing the rate  of  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution by the employer is going to help save jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, cutting CPF rates across the board for the\r\n\r\nolder  workers is akin to using a blunt instrument for  a\r\n\r\nsurgical  operation.  By a stroke of the pen, it  affects\r\n\r\nall employees who fall into the category, irrespective of\r\n\r\nwhether they are effective, efficient or productive.  The\r\n\r\nquestion  which  should legitimately be  asked  by  those\r\n\r\naffected is why should those who are capable be  made  to\r\n\r\nsuffer for those who are not as able to get a job or  are\r\n\r\nabout  to lose their jobs.  Is the Government being  fair\r\n\r\nto these people?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than embark on a policy that has no certainty\r\n\r\nof  saving  jobs or getting jobs for older  workers,  and\r\n\r\ntelling  employers  to  pass  the  savings  back  to  the\r\n\r\nemployees,   perhaps  the  Government   should   consider\r\n\r\nadopting  the  approach of encouraging older  workers  to\r\n\r\naccept lower wages to make themselves competitive at  the\r\n\r\nmarketplace  and  perhaps  to continue  to  emphasise  on\r\n\r\ntraining  and retraining to upgrade the skills  of  these\r\n\r\nworkers.   This  approach has the  advantage  of  leaving\r\n\r\nwages  to  be  determined efficiently by the marketplace,\r\n\r\nand thus avoid the application of a blunt instrument that\r\n\r\nhas the effect of throwing the baby out with the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbath water.  Additionally, the Government should consider\r\n\r\ntax benefits for enlightened companies to hire or keep on\r\n\r\ntheir payroll older employees.  The use of tax incentives\r\n\r\ngives  a more positive edge to the solution, rather  than\r\n\r\nthe choice of CPF reduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other concern. Today, we allow the CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate for the older workers  to  be  reduced\r\n\r\nbecause  we  think  that this will help with  employment.\r\n\r\nDoes  that mean that the Government in future is prepared\r\n\r\nto  recognise  other  categories of  employees  as  well?\r\n\r\nWould the Government, say, lower the CPF contribution for\r\n\r\nthe  disabled  to make them more employable?   Would  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   increase   the  contribution   for   foreign\r\n\r\nemployees to create a more level playing field between  a\r\n\r\nlocal  and  foreign  employee?  The point  is,  making  a\r\n\r\nspecial exception for any particular category of employee\r\n\r\nmay  be  creating a precedent that may well open  up  the\r\n\r\nfloodgates for the others.  Once we allow this,  it  will\r\n\r\nbe  easy to see how easily this may be opened up to other\r\n\r\npossibilities as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to my second point and that is, very\r\n\r\nbriefly, compelling the poor to save.  Our CPF system  is\r\n\r\ntargetted at those in the category of 10th percentile and\r\n\r\nthe  80th percentile.  What this translates into is  that\r\n\r\nthe  poor Singaporeans in the relevant category will  not\r\n\r\nbenefit substantially from the most important form of the\r\n\r\nsafety net when they retire.  The proposed policy of  not\r\n\r\ncompelling Singaporeans whose income is below  a  certain\r\n\r\nbenchmark of $500 a month to save is, in effect, aimed at\r\n\r\nhelping them to improve their cash flow.  However,  while\r\n\r\nthe  intention  is  well meaning,  the  larger  issue  is\r\n\r\nwhether such a move really helps them in the longer term.\r\n\r\nThe  truth of the matter is that by allowing them not  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to their CPF account, the Government may  just\r\n\r\nbe  postponing the problem for them.  How are they  going\r\n\r\nto  provide for themselves when they retire?  It does not\r\n\r\nlook like the State can avoid the issue of the welfare of\r\n\r\nthese  Singaporeans, many of whom, through  no  fault  of\r\n\r\ntheir own, are caught\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nup in this situation.  And because they are Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nit  is our duty and responsibility to carry them, whether\r\n\r\npresently or for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we accept this responsibility, I would suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government help these poorer  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nbuild   up   their    CPF  accounts  by  making   monthly\r\n\r\ncontributions on their behalf.  This move has the benefit\r\n\r\nof  giving  those Singaporeans a sense of  security  that\r\n\r\nthere will always be a place at the dining table for them\r\n\r\neven  if  they  are  poor.  It does  not  give  out  cash\r\n\r\ndirectly  and thus avoid the problem of potential  abuse.\r\n\r\nBut  for future Singaporeans, it will be fairer for  them\r\n\r\nas  we  will  not be passing the problems of the  present\r\n\r\ngeneration for them to shoulder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the weekend, I attended the Remaking of\r\n\r\nSingapore  retreat.  During the retreat, a  question  was\r\n\r\nraised  as to what our vision for the future of Singapore\r\n\r\nis.   Sir,  that question sets many of us thinking.   For\r\n\r\nmany,  defining the future vision for Singapore as a  set\r\n\r\npiece  against  a broad canvas is not something  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  given serious consideration to.  All of us gathered\r\n\r\nhere  in  this House do have a vague notion.  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the future Singapore that we want will be  a  place\r\n\r\nwhere  we  can  pursue  happiness,  fraternity,  freedom,\r\n\r\nequality and justice and ideals which can be carried  out\r\n\r\nin  an  environment  that seeks  to  maximise  the  human\r\n\r\npotential that every Singaporean is endowed with.  Beyond\r\n\r\nthose  ideals,  we  are not very clear.   Perhaps  it  is\r\n\r\nevolving all the time.  However, what I am clear about is\r\n\r\nthat future Singapore must not be a place where the older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans feel that they are second-class citizens  by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of  their  age, and because they  can  no  longer\r\n\r\neffectively contribute to the economy.  I am  also  clear\r\n\r\nthat  future  Singapore must not be a  place  where  poor\r\n\r\nSingaporeans feel that they have to eat out of the  hands\r\n\r\nof fellow Singaporeans, and be made to feel the part of a\r\n\r\ngrateful supplicant.  What we must not do is to  rob  any\r\n\r\nclass of Singaporeans of their sense of dignity and self-worth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if at the end of the day, policies - not just\r\n\r\npolicies pertaining to the changes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  the  CPF  -  would result in any Singaporean  feeling\r\n\r\nless  than  worthy,  then I feel that Singapore  and  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will be poorer for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  recommendation by the Economic Review  Committee  to\r\n\r\nrefocus   the   CPF  system  on  retirement  expenditure,\r\n\r\nhealthcare  and  home ownership is timely,  perhaps  even\r\n\r\noverdue.  It is hard to argue against the principles  set\r\n\r\nout  in  the  report.  But we have to be very careful  in\r\n\r\ntheir  implementation, as any change to  the  CPF  system\r\n\r\nwould naturally lead to changes in the flow of funds into\r\n\r\nor  out of properties and could have a significant impact\r\n\r\non  the  property  market,  public as  well  as  private.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we should not make changes to the CPF  system\r\n\r\nwithout considering the necessary changes that should  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out in the HDB property market, which represents\r\n\r\nmore  than 85% of all household units within our  shores.\r\n\r\nTo  do  one  without the other could lead to adverse  and\r\n\r\nundesirable consequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to focus on the proposed changes\r\n\r\narising from the review of HDB's market rate loans and to\r\n\r\nsupplement  some of the points brought up earlier  by  Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran,  Mr Andy Gan and Dr Lily Neo, as I think  this\r\n\r\nwill   have  far-reaching  consequences.   I  have  three\r\n\r\nconcerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has all along been a monopolistic supplier\r\n\r\nof affordable housing for the masses.  One of the reasons\r\n\r\nSingaporeans buy HDB flats is the safety net it  provides\r\n\r\nin  bad times.  People look to the Government for shelter\r\n\r\nand,  in Singapore, the Government is expected to provide\r\n\r\na  roof  over  our heads.  Section 51 of the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Act provides that no HDB flat shall  vest  in\r\n\r\nthe  Official Assignee on the bankruptcy of the Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen owner, and no HDB flat shall be attached  in  the\r\n\r\nexecution  of  a  decree of any court.    Now,  with  the\r\n\r\nproposed  move by the HDB to discontinue granting  market\r\n\r\nrate  mortgage loans, HDB flat buyers will have no choice\r\n\r\nbut   to   obtain  such  loans  from  private  commercial\r\n\r\nfinancial   institutions.   My  concern  is   that   when\r\n\r\nrepayment is in arrears at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntimes   of   difficulties,  these  commercial   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions  will  be  tougher,  less  sympathetic   and\r\n\r\nfaceless in forcing the disposal of the HDB flat compared\r\n\r\nto  the HDB.  This will lead to an increase in the number\r\n\r\nof  people who will be made homeless without a roof  over\r\n\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not a small matter. For the year 2001,\r\n\r\nthe number of bankruptcy orders issued was 3,247, and  in\r\n\r\nthe  first  five months of this year, 1,457 persons  were\r\n\r\ndeclared bankrupt.  Under the present system, if  someone\r\n\r\nowns  an HDB flat and has difficulties servicing his  HDB\r\n\r\nloan repayment, he can approach the HDB for the repayment\r\n\r\nto  be  rescheduled and his creditors  cannot  touch  his\r\n\r\nflat.  He can continue to own his HDB flat and his family\r\n\r\nmembers can continue to live in it, even when he is  made\r\n\r\na  bankrupt.  With the changes to the rules, if the  loan\r\n\r\nfor  his  HDB  flat is from a commercial bank,  his  flat\r\n\r\nwould   be   forced  sold  as  part  of  the   bankruptcy\r\n\r\nproceedings, and he and his family members would be  left\r\n\r\nwithout shelter.  I would like to ask DPM where can  such\r\n\r\na  family  turn to.  What are the options  open  to  him?\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  fundamental change in the structure  of  our\r\n\r\nhousing  safety net, and one that we should not undertake\r\n\r\nlightly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there an affordable rental housing market that\r\n\r\nthose  in  need can turn to?  If not, how can  we  create\r\n\r\none?   I understand it is the HDB's intention not  to  be\r\n\r\nthe  provider of subsidised rental flats in  a  big  way.\r\n\r\nAnd  under the present rules, HDB owners are not  allowed\r\n\r\nto   sublet  their  flats  unless  under  very   specific\r\n\r\nsituations.   So, where are the affordable  rental  flats\r\n\r\ngoing  to come from, if not from the HDB and the existing\r\n\r\npool of HDB flats?  I would like to urge the HDB to relax\r\n\r\nits   rules  on  subletting,  as  this  must  surely   be\r\n\r\nconsequential  to  its decision not to continue  granting\r\n\r\nmarket rate loans.  I cannot see how the HDB can say to a\r\n\r\nHDB  flat buyer, you must get your loan from a commercial\r\n\r\nbank  and  bear the risk of being evicted if you default,\r\n\r\nand  yet  not  allow the owner to rent out his  flat  for\r\n\r\nextra  income, or to order his life in such a way that he\r\n\r\nwould be able to meet his financial obligations.  But, on\r\n\r\nthe other hand, if\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrental of HDB flats is relaxed and a large number of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  is  suddenly released into the rental market,  the\r\n\r\nimpact  on  the  private property rental market  will  be\r\n\r\ntremendous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another HDB rule that has to be reviewed is\r\n\r\nthat  the  buyer of a resale flat cannot resell the  flat\r\n\r\nwithin the 30-month minimum occupation period.  Now, what\r\n\r\nif  a  buyer  had taken a market rate loan and,  say,  12\r\n\r\nmonths later, he could not afford to service the loan due\r\n\r\nto  a change in his financial circumstances?  Can he sell\r\n\r\nthe  flat  to  lower his financial burden?   Can  he  buy\r\n\r\nanother  and smaller resale flat?  Previously,  the  flat\r\n\r\nowner could go to the HDB and reschedule his repayment if\r\n\r\nhe has financial difficulties.  In future, the commercial\r\n\r\nbank  is  not going to be so  understanding nor  patient,\r\n\r\nand  may even impose very punitive default interest  rate\r\n\r\nwhich  applies  when the borrower is in  arrears  on  his\r\n\r\nrepayment.   The  flat owner will then be caught  between\r\n\r\nthe  devil and the deep blue sea.  Therefore, if we  want\r\n\r\nto  go  the free market way for mortgage loans,  then  we\r\n\r\nshould  also  go the full haul and such HDB  restrictions\r\n\r\nshould be removed totally or relaxed significantly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next concern is about the change to give the\r\n\r\nmortgagee  bank  the first charge over  the  property  in\r\n\r\npriority to the CPF Board.  The present system where  the\r\n\r\nCPF  Board has the first charge and the sale proceeds  of\r\n\r\nthe  property would first go to the CPF member's  account\r\n\r\nto  satisfy any withdrawals made and interest that  would\r\n\r\nhave been earned, has been with us for many years and has\r\n\r\nserved  us well.   I say this because although  the  bank\r\n\r\nhas  a  second  charge, the borrower still  has  personal\r\n\r\nliabilities  to  the  creditor bank  to  meet  fully  any\r\n\r\nshortfall in the repayment.  So, if the outstanding  bank\r\n\r\nloan  is  $600,000 and the property is sold for $800,000,\r\n\r\nbut  $300,000  has  to  go  back  to  CPF,  the  borrower\r\n\r\ncontinues to be indebted to the bank for the shortfall of\r\n\r\n$100,000.   And  the bank will sue and enforce  for  that\r\n\r\namount.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if we reverse the order, and the borrower owes\r\n\r\nCPF Board the $100,000,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhow  will the CPF Board enforce for the money to be  paid\r\n\r\ninto  the member's CPF account?  Will the CPF Board  make\r\n\r\nhim  a  bankrupt?  This being the case,  with  CPF  Board\r\n\r\nbeing a less \"tough\" creditor compared to a bank, I  fear\r\n\r\nthat buyers of property will become more adventurous  and\r\n\r\ntake  more  risk  than necessary in deciding  to  make  a\r\n\r\nproperty  purchase.  Somehow, people still do  not  quite\r\n\r\ntreat their CPF money as their own money, and they do not\r\n\r\nfeel the pinch so much when they lose it or spend it.   A\r\n\r\nclear  example is Medisave.  People have no qualms  about\r\n\r\nbeing  warded  in  expensive  private  hospitals  if  the\r\n\r\nexpenses can be deducted from their Medisave account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next point is about reverse mortgage. I\r\n\r\nknow  this issue has been discussed on many occasions  in\r\n\r\nthe  past,  but  I think it is worth revisiting  at  this\r\n\r\njuncture.  The intention of the proposed changes  to  the\r\n\r\nCPF  system  is to refocus on three areas  -   retirement\r\n\r\nexpenditure, healthcare and home ownership, and  also  to\r\n\r\nfix the relative proportions of these three sub-accounts.\r\n\r\nIn the past, many people had over committed in properties\r\n\r\nand  are now left with proportionately insufficient funds\r\n\r\nfor adequate healthcare and retirement expenditure.  This\r\n\r\ncould  also be caused by unexpected illnesses  that  have\r\n\r\nled  to  an  increase  in medical  expenses.   I  believe\r\n\r\nreverse  mortgage  is one way to realign  the  respective\r\n\r\nproportions  and  allow the CPF account holder  to  shift\r\n\r\nsome  of  his funds that are locked in the HDB flat  into\r\n\r\nfunds  that  are  available for  medical  and  retirement\r\n\r\nexpenses.  I would like to urge the Government to  review\r\n\r\nits policy on reverse mortgage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subject to the above concerns being considered,\r\n\r\nI support the changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I agree with the views of Mr Matthias Yao.   It  is\r\n\r\nalways  better  to  resolve a  minor  problem  before  it\r\n\r\nevolves   into  a  major  one.  Let  me   give   you   an\r\n\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, I injured a finger while playing\r\n\r\nvolleyball. I thought it was nothing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nserious  and simply applied some traditional medicine  on\r\n\r\nit.  But three weeks later, it became swollen.  I had  to\r\n\r\nsee  a  specialist.   After  an  X-ray  examination,  the\r\n\r\nspecialist  said that it was not a very serious  problem,\r\n\r\nbut it would take another six weeks before it would heal.\r\n\r\nI  had  to wear this cap on the injured finger and it  is\r\n\r\nvery  troublesome.  The specialist also told me that  had\r\n\r\nI  consulted  him earlier, say, within one  week  of  the\r\n\r\ninjury,   he  would have cured it in a  few  days'  time.\r\n\r\nThis example shows that if you have any problem, you must\r\n\r\nfirst try to understand it as early as possible and  find\r\n\r\nthe  correct  solution for it.  So, when  we  talk  about\r\n\r\nfuture  economic development, we have the Economic Review\r\n\r\nCommittee (ERC) established to look into it, and the  ERC\r\n\r\nrecently made some recommendations concerning changes  to\r\n\r\nour existing CPF system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the announcement was made, I went on my\r\n\r\nusual  round to the coffeeshops to hear the views of  the\r\n\r\npublic. This time round, the reaction is not as strong as\r\n\r\nthe  time when the transport fare hike was announced.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt,  there are some discussions about the CPF changes.\r\n\r\nBut  our people are generally very rational in trying  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  and  accept the changes  to  the  CPF.   Some\r\n\r\nresidents feel that these changes are timely; while  some\r\n\r\nstill have doubts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last Parliament sitting, we debated on the\r\n\r\nfare  increases, and the feeling was that the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  were beginning to show concern for    national\r\n\r\nissues.   The people are watching, and they do  not  miss\r\n\r\nany changes that the Government proposes to make. This is\r\n\r\ngood!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two views on this. First, they support\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations  of the ERC.  At  present,  if  your\r\n\r\nmonthly  income is $200 and above, you have to contribute\r\n\r\nto  CPF.   But now, you do not have to do so unless  your\r\n\r\nincome  is   $500 and above. This means the  lower-income\r\n\r\npeople  would have more in terms of take-home  pay.  This\r\n\r\nrecommendation has the support of the people.  This  will\r\n\r\nhelp those who do temporary work and odd jobs.  They like\r\n\r\nit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecause  they will now have more cash to take home  every\r\n\r\nmonth.  At this bad time, this change is a piece of  good\r\n\r\nnews to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, this will also help those people\r\n\r\nwho  are  unemployed and are looking for  jobs.   At  the\r\n\r\nmoment, when jobs are not so easily available, they  will\r\n\r\nbe  more prepared to accept lower-paid jobs, because they\r\n\r\ndo  not have to deduct money from their pay to contribute\r\n\r\nto  CPF. Psychologically, they will find the lower  wages\r\n\r\nmore acceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some residents who have a different\r\n\r\nview.   For  those  in the age group between  50-55,  the\r\n\r\nemployers' CPF contribution will be frozen at  16%.   The\r\n\r\nproposal is based on two points.  One is to encourage the\r\n\r\ncompanies to employ older workers and, secondly, to lower\r\n\r\nthe  labour cost to keep the business viable and for  the\r\n\r\nworkers to keep their jobs.  Theoretically, it is a  very\r\n\r\ngood  policy and measure.  But, in reality, is it  really\r\n\r\nso?   Singapore  is a pragmatic society.  Many  employers\r\n\r\nand  companies employ people according to the  cost  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  bear. The meagre 4% saving on CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nmakes  very  little difference to them.  For example,  to\r\n\r\nemploy  a fresh university graduate with a pay of $3,000,\r\n\r\n20% CPF means the company has to pay $600.  But for a 52-year  old  senior  officer who is paid  $5,000,  16%  CPF\r\n\r\namounts to $800. The total wage cost is still higher than\r\n\r\nthat   of  the  fresh  graduate.   There  is  not  enough\r\n\r\nincentive for the employer to take in older workers  when\r\n\r\nthey can get better qualified and more productive younger\r\n\r\nworkers at a lower cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this measure will not be very effective.\r\n\r\nThese older workers started working when they were young.\r\n\r\nThey have made great contributions to the company to  lay\r\n\r\nthe   foundation  of  the  company.   Such  efforts   and\r\n\r\ncontributions should not be ignored.  In the world, there\r\n\r\nare many, many 50-year old people who are very important.\r\n\r\nSo,  we cannot deem a worker to be less productive or too\r\n\r\nexpensive the moment they turn 50.  As a matter of  fact,\r\n\r\nto many great people, life begins at 50.  Take China, for\r\n\r\nexample,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmost,  if  not all, their leaders took on top  leadership\r\n\r\nposition  only when they were over 50 years of age.  Even\r\n\r\nour very own Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was 50 when  he\r\n\r\ntook over the helm to become the second generation leader\r\n\r\nto lead Singapore into more prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people who are aged between 50 and 55\r\n\r\nnow  is  quite big, because they are the ones born during\r\n\r\nthe baby boom years after the second World War. They have\r\n\r\ngone  through  various stages of our nation building  and\r\n\r\nhave   rendered   meritorious   contributions   to    the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore.  Without such people, Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  not  have  been so successful and  so  prosperous,\r\n\r\neconomically and socially.  In community services,  those\r\n\r\nin  the age group of 50 to 55 are the most active.   They\r\n\r\ntake  part in various community activities and contribute\r\n\r\ntremendously to the future of Singapore.  They are a very\r\n\r\nimportant group of people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the new generation of citizens\r\n\r\nare  getting  married late, between 26 and  28.   At  50,\r\n\r\ntheir  children  will be about 18 to 20  years  old,  and\r\n\r\nattending   polytechnic  or  university.   The  financial\r\n\r\nburden peaks around this time, at between 50 and 55.   To\r\n\r\ncut  their CPF amounts to cutting their income, and  that\r\n\r\nwill undoubtedly enhance their financial burden. This  is\r\n\r\na   very  important  issue  which  the  people  are  very\r\n\r\nconcerned with.  In order to solve this problem,  Dr  Low\r\n\r\nSeow  Chay asked whether, during the bad times we reduced\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution  rate to 16%, and when times are  good,\r\n\r\ndo  we  not have the moral obligation to have it restored\r\n\r\nto 20 percentage points?  So, every few years, we have to\r\n\r\nmake some adjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NTUC has also raised the issue of flexible\r\n\r\nwage  system.   I  think this is a good system  and  many\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  adopting  the  new  system.   I  am  just\r\n\r\nthinking whether we can also have a flexible CPF  scheme,\r\n\r\nie,  between age 50 and 55, the CPF contribution rate can\r\n\r\nrange from 16% to 20%, and companies,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich  are able to gauge the contribution and performance\r\n\r\nof  their employees, can decide how much to pay for their\r\n\r\nrespective employees' CPF.  If this employee can  make  a\r\n\r\nlot  of money for the company, why should the company cut\r\n\r\ndown  the  CPF by 4 percentage points?  In this  way,  it\r\n\r\nwill allow the company more flexibility in making the CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions,  and that will encourage  the  workers  to\r\n\r\nwork  harder and do better.  The companies will therefore\r\n\r\nhave  more  autonomy to exercise their  own  judgment  to\r\n\r\ndecide  on  how  much CPF contributions  to  pay  to  the\r\n\r\nindividual  workers.  We should not fix the rate  at  16%\r\n\r\nacross-the-board.   There may  be  100  people  or  1,000\r\n\r\npeople working in the company. They cannot have the  same\r\n\r\nlevel  of performance.  So, we should  allow the  company\r\n\r\nto  decide  on its own.  But the Government  now  decides\r\n\r\nthat  for age 50 to 55, the company has the right to  fix\r\n\r\nthe  CPF at 16%.  I think that the ERC should revisit its\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about HDB's proposal to transfer\r\n\r\nthe  housing loans to the banks.  There is a  rule  which\r\n\r\nsays  that if the people want to downgrade from a  bigger\r\n\r\nflat  to a smaller flat, they cannot borrow from the HDB.\r\n\r\nSo,  they  must  borrow from the bank.  Now,  HDB  allows\r\n\r\nevery  citizen to buy two flats, ie, a small 3-room  flat\r\n\r\nor  to  upgrade from a 3-room flat to a 4-room or  5-room\r\n\r\nflat.   So they will have two opportunities to enjoy  the\r\n\r\nsubsidies from HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a citizen started off with a 3-room flat and then\r\n\r\nupgraded  to a 4-room or 5-room flat, when he  grows  old\r\n\r\nand all his children are married and not living with him,\r\n\r\nthen  he  would find that he does not need the bigger  4-room or 5-room flat.  Now, he wants to downgrade to a  3-room or smaller flat.  But, he cannot borrow from the HDB\r\n\r\nand  has  to borrow from the bank.  By that time, because\r\n\r\nof  financial  difficulty due to  economic  downturn,  he\r\n\r\nwould have to sell his bigger flat to buy a smaller  one.\r\n\r\nIn  those  circumstances, he would still have  to  borrow\r\n\r\nfrom  the  bank.  But banks are commercial  institutions.\r\n\r\nIf  you are old and have financial difficulties, then  it\r\n\r\nis  unlikely  that the bank will lend any money  to  you.\r\n\r\nThis will become a major problem for the old citizens.  I\r\n\r\nwould\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the HDB be more flexible towards the  older\r\n\r\ncitizens,   particularly  those  who  are  in   financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  When they need to borrow money, then  they\r\n\r\nshould be considered on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, I support the Statement of Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Lee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, drastic\r\n\r\ntimes  call for drastic measures.  In all the years  that\r\n\r\nSingapore has been governed by the PAP Government,  I  am\r\n\r\nglad  to note that we have not shied away from tough  but\r\n\r\nnecessary measures.  The recommendations of the ERC,  led\r\n\r\nby  Mr Tharman, and what DPM Lee had announced today  are\r\n\r\nno  different.  Though I agree and support  the  measures\r\n\r\nintroduced,  what we have heard are fundamental  paradigm\r\n\r\nshifts in the way we organise Singapore.  Paradigm shifts\r\n\r\nare  very subjective to judgment.  Who would have thought\r\n\r\nthat  when we introduced the stop-at-two family  planning\r\n\r\npolicy  more  than  30 years ago, we would  have  runaway\r\n\r\nsuccess  rates so much so that we are facing  procreation\r\n\r\nproblems instead?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind, Sir, the net result of the changes\r\n\r\nintroduced  today  is  the shift  of  greater  individual\r\n\r\ncitizen  responsibility.  Allow me to highlight one  such\r\n\r\nchange and its possible consequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raising of income floor from $200 to $500 would\r\n\r\nbe beneficial and encouraging to part-time workers.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am concerned, however, that the lifting of the monthly\r\n\r\nsalary of an employee not liable for CPF contribution  to\r\n\r\n$500  might be negative on our low-income home  ownership\r\n\r\nscheme.   I am aware that this change would result  in  a\r\n\r\nworker  earning  $500 or less having more  money  in  his\r\n\r\npocket.   Hence, if he wants a flat of his  own,  he  now\r\n\r\nwould have to put more money aside from his take-home pay\r\n\r\nevery  month for this purpose.  However, this is an ideal\r\n\r\nsituation.  Our home ownership in the last 10  years  has\r\n\r\nnot  changed much.  The percentage of the rental  section\r\n\r\nof  the population remains persistently at 10% of the HDB\r\n\r\npopulation.  This is despite the fact that in the last 10\r\n\r\nyears or so, income\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas  gone  up  and  the  trend  in  property  is  towards\r\n\r\nupgrading, and there are also Government measures to help\r\n\r\nthem  own  their own place.  Yet, the percentile  remains\r\n\r\nwhere they are all these years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appeal to the Government to consider softening the\r\n\r\nrequirements  for the low-income group to own  their  own\r\n\r\nhomes,  perhaps by reducing the deposits even further  to\r\n\r\n5%.   Also,  I  do call upon the Government  to  step  up\r\n\r\npublic  education on individual financial management  and\r\n\r\nto  further educate the virtues and importance of  saving\r\n\r\nfor rainy days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me go to my second point. In some academic\r\n\r\ncircles,  there  is a view that Taiwanese  or  Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nChinese, when faced with economic difficulties,  rely  on\r\n\r\nthemselves to survive.  Singaporeans, on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nwhen  faced with a difficult situation, would ask:   What\r\n\r\nis  the  Government going to do about it?  Our  Northeast\r\n\r\nAsian  neighbours'  resilience  can  be  seen  from   the\r\n\r\nhundreds  of  thousands of savvy Taiwanese businesses  in\r\n\r\nmainland China.  This is despite the restriction  imposed\r\n\r\nby  the  Taiwanese  government  and  other  communication\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   There  are also reports  that  Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nunemployed  are  quick on the mend to  take  up  jobs  in\r\n\r\nmainland China, which they previously shunned in order to\r\n\r\nsurvive.   Singaporeans, on the other hand, look  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  solutions or directions when  confronted\r\n\r\nwith a difficult situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point that I wish to make is with reference\r\n\r\nto  the recommendations of the ERC to enhance the returns\r\n\r\nof  the CPF balances through more varieties of investment\r\n\r\ninstruments,  including  the low-cost,  low-risk  pension\r\n\r\nplans.  I am fully in support of this move of introducing\r\n\r\nthe  low-risk pension plans.  However, I am also  of  the\r\n\r\nview  that  at present, there are too many types  of  CPF\r\n\r\npension funds and it is confusing to Singaporeans.  There\r\n\r\nare  the many Henderson funds, three or five arrow Japan,\r\n\r\nUS  or  European growth funds, technology-related  funds,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.   Do  we think our average Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\neconomically savvy enough to make an informed choice when\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvesting  their  CPF  balances?  I  think  not,  as  the\r\n\r\npercentage  of the people using their CPF  to  invest  in\r\n\r\nstocks  and  shares and making money is a dismal  10%  or\r\n\r\nless.  While I laud the ERC's intent to boost the returns\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans' CPF monies, I would urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  educate  the  public on investing  their  CPF  monies\r\n\r\nwisely.  This is to echo what hon. Member Mrs Yu-Foo  Yee\r\n\r\nShoon  has  mentioned earlier on.  Otherwise, instead  of\r\n\r\nboosting  their  retirement nest, they  might  have  lost\r\n\r\neverything,  for  example,  if  they  have  invested   in\r\n\r\ntechnology-related funds earlier on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to raise a point on the reversal\r\n\r\nof   charge  position.   The  stated  intention  of   the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the ERC is to allow for Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nhave more monies themselves when they retire, instead  of\r\n\r\ndepending on their children.  However, by allowing  banks\r\n\r\nto  be  the  first  creditor, instead of  the  CPF,  runs\r\n\r\ncontrary to the stated intention.  This is because, as  I\r\n\r\nhave  highlighted earlier on, Singaporeans are  dependent\r\n\r\non the Government and not investment savvy enough.  Thus,\r\n\r\nthey  might not have known the full risk involved in real\r\n\r\nestate  investment  and indulge  in  it  with  their  CPF\r\n\r\nmonies.   When banks have the first go, there  is  almost\r\n\r\nnot  much left to be returned back to the CPF when things\r\n\r\ngo  wrong.  I am afraid the public might be lured by  the\r\n\r\nprospect of profitable property speculations and overlook\r\n\r\nthe  risk  involved.   The prospect  of  one  losing  his\r\n\r\nretirement nest is real.  Is the Government educating the\r\n\r\npublic  adequately?   I call on the Government  for  more\r\n\r\nefforts   in   educating  the  public  in  more   prudent\r\n\r\ninvestments and the managing of their savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, I applaud the tough but necessary\r\n\r\nmeasures.   However, in this paradigm shift, I  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to adequately educate Singaporeans,  not  only\r\n\r\nthe  educated  but also particularly the lesser  educated\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, on the duties of greater individual citizen\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate on CPF changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF is a highly sensitive issue. In 1984 when\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of CPF withdrawal age was discussed,  it  was\r\n\r\nalmost  explosive.   The Howe Yoon Chong  Report  on  the\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Problems of the Aged was almost derailed\r\n\r\nwhen  Singaporeans were not ready for its recommendations\r\n\r\nto  change the withdrawal age of CPF balance from  55  to\r\n\r\n60, and then 65.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for any potentially\r\n\r\nexplosive  subject, it is a matter of T&T (treatment  and\r\n\r\ntiming).  Not only must one package and present it  well,\r\n\r\ntiming must also be right.  Judging from the reaction  we\r\n\r\nhave  heard  about  the  ERC's  recommendations  and  the\r\n\r\nendorsement expected and now confirmed by DPM, I  believe\r\n\r\nwe  are  doing all right.  Allow me, Sir, to congratulate\r\n\r\nthe  ERC for a job well done.  The press briefing,  which\r\n\r\nSenior Minister of State Tharman Shanmugaratnam and   the\r\n\r\nteam  had,  was excellent.  And they practically  covered\r\n\r\nall the areas, including the concerns felt by the public.\r\n\r\nEven  my  trade union friends spoke well of the treatment\r\n\r\ngiven  by  the  ERC, especially when they  addressed  the\r\n\r\nexpected concerns of the labour force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF had for a long time been seen as a sacred\r\n\r\ncow  in  preserving  our ideals of democratic  socialism.\r\n\r\nBut  true  to Singapore's pragmatic approach to  policies\r\n\r\nand  changing realities, even the CPF had been  subjected\r\n\r\nto many changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many MPs yesterday celebrated Racial Harmony\r\n\r\nDay  and, for some, it might be considered as insensitive\r\n\r\nto  talk  about  slaughtering sacred cows.   But  let  me\r\n\r\nassure you that, even in Islam, when in real emergencies,\r\n\r\neven pork is considered halal than Muslims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This latest round of changes again reaffirms\r\n\r\nSingapore's  confidence on our system  of  governance  in\r\n\r\nwilling   to   make   bold   changes,   when   necessary.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans should take note of the signal sent  out  by\r\n\r\nthe  changes  and  make  their own  preparation  for  the\r\n\r\nuncertainties of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe   future  challenges,  as  emphasised  by  DPM.   The\r\n\r\ndecision  not to restore fully the CPF rate  for  workers\r\n\r\naged  50-55  is  one  example.   It  must  be  a  painful\r\n\r\ndecision, but it must surely be more painful to lose your\r\n\r\njobs compared to a reduction in pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Sir, there will be those who would look\r\n\r\nat  this decision as a breach of trust, as the Government\r\n\r\nhas  promised to restore CPF for all.  But for those  who\r\n\r\nfeel  that way, I would like to urge them to please think\r\n\r\nagain  the  employment problems facing the age group  are\r\n\r\nreal  and  better  to  be  realistic  than  to  lose  out\r\n\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I would like to share the\r\n\r\nsentiments  expressed by hon. Member Halimah  Yacob  that\r\n\r\nemployers  pay deserving workers between the ages  of  50\r\n\r\nand  55 either in the form of monthly variable component,\r\n\r\nor  bonus.  Similarly, I would also like to call  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to give CPF top-ups, or Singapore Shares,  to\r\n\r\nsuch  affected groups of people when the economy permits.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  should  also  welcome  Government's  caring\r\n\r\ninitiative   to  implement  a  Transitional  CPF   Top-up\r\n\r\nComponent (TCTC) for civil servants aged 50-55, such that\r\n\r\nwhen CPF is restored for the others, they will receive in\r\n\r\nthe  TCTC part of what they would have received had their\r\n\r\nCPF been restored.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to urge the companies which could\r\n\r\nafford  such  measures to implement them for their  staff\r\n\r\nand  win  better loyalty and productivity.  Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nthe  underlying point worth emphasising is that times are\r\n\r\nchanging and whether for the 50-55 age group, or  younger\r\n\r\nworkers, training and retraining are cornerstones workers\r\n\r\nneed  to  pay special heed to.  Especially for the  40-50\r\n\r\nage   group,  they  should  be  thankful  that  the   CPF\r\n\r\nrestoration  is possible, but do take a serious  look  at\r\n\r\ntheir skills level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am glad the Government has\r\n\r\ndecided  to extend the SRP and PJTP training schemes.   I\r\n\r\nfeel  that DPM should consider extending the schemes  not\r\n\r\nonly  till 31st October 2003, but for at least two years.\r\n\r\nThe problems of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemployability for the not-so-young will be  with  us  for\r\n\r\nsome time and they will need continued help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the many changes recommended for CPF\r\n\r\nand   other  related  areas,  particularly,  housing  and\r\n\r\nhealthcare,  are  well meaning.  But  in  the  nature  of\r\n\r\nchanges,  the  Government should monitor the consequences\r\n\r\nof  those changes and make necessary adjustments after  a\r\n\r\nperiod of time, say, six months later, after experiencing\r\n\r\nthe  results and outcome of these changes.  As the saying\r\n\r\ngoes,  \"The  only more painful experience  learning  from\r\n\r\nexperience is not to learn from experience.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the statement on CPF and related changes,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, despite\r\n\r\nhon. Member Mr Matthias Yao's attempt earlier to redirect\r\n\r\nMembers' interest to other subjects in the debate,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  I remain rather fixated on the proposal  to  keep\r\n\r\nthe  employer's CPF contribution to 16% for workers  aged\r\n\r\n50-55 years.  Let me say that DPM, Mdm Halimah Yacob  and\r\n\r\nMr  Yao  have all talked about the concerns that we  have\r\n\r\nfor  the  older, lower skilled workers.   Myself  and,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  many  other  Members who have  spoken  before  me\r\n\r\nrecognise  that it is a concern and that  it  needs  some\r\n\r\nurgent  attention.  We recognise that  this  proposal  to\r\n\r\nlower  the  employer's contribution  rate  is  a  sincere\r\n\r\nattempt to address the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am not convinced that this is an appropriate\r\n\r\nor  an  effective solution.  So the argument is not about\r\n\r\nthe  fact that there is a problem.  The argument is about\r\n\r\nwhether  or not this is really going to be effective,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  whether it will be counter-productive.   Companies\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  hire  and  employ  workers  who   are\r\n\r\nproductive  and make useful contributions, regardless  of\r\n\r\ntheir  age.   Companies will not employ workers  who  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  get  the  job  done,  regardless  of  the  4%\r\n\r\ndiscount,  so to speak, on their CPF cost.  All  that  we\r\n\r\nare  going  to  achieve with this move is to disadvantage\r\n\r\nthose productive workers in the 50-55 age range, who are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngainfully employed and make it harder for them  to  build\r\n\r\nup their retirement nest egg.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we will further reinforce the\r\n\r\nperception  and  the practice of treating  older  persons\r\n\r\nuniversally  as  a  group,  as  being  worth   less   and\r\n\r\ncontributing  less.   Government has  said,  on  previous\r\n\r\noccasions,  that we must move away from using  CPF  as  a\r\n\r\nconvenient but blunt instrument to lower cost in economic\r\n\r\nhard times.  The Economic Review Sub-committee on CPF has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we  should refocus the  scheme  back  to  the\r\n\r\nfundamentals  of providing for people's  basic  needs  in\r\n\r\ntheir retirement.  And indeed, the other proposals,  such\r\n\r\nas  restraining  the amount to be spent on  property  and\r\n\r\nincreasing  the Minimum Sum, are clearly  steps  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection.  But this proposal to cut the contributions of\r\n\r\n50-55  year olds is slipping right back to the old  habit\r\n\r\nof  using  CPF to fix a problem that should be addressed,\r\n\r\nat source, in other ways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root causes of the group of older workers having\r\n\r\ndifficulty  finding jobs lie, firstly, in their  lack  of\r\n\r\nskills,  or  ability, or willingness  to  fill  available\r\n\r\njobs;  and, secondly, their relatively higher cost due to\r\n\r\nour  seniority-based pay system.  The real  solutions  to\r\n\r\nthis  problem therefore involve reskilling these workers,\r\n\r\nwhere  possible, and this has been covered at  length  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  the efforts we are making in skills upgrading,\r\n\r\nalso  in  getting them to accept different kinds of  work\r\n\r\nthat Singaporeans currently find or think unattractive or\r\n\r\nbeneath  them, and also in getting companies to  look  at\r\n\r\nredesigning jobs so that older workers are able to manage\r\n\r\nin areas where physical strength is an issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next group of solutions would be pushing harder\r\n\r\nto shorten salary scales and increasing performance-based\r\n\r\nremuneration so that the factor of higher cost  of  older\r\n\r\nworkers due to the seniority-based system becomes a  non-issue.   These are the real solutions, not the convenient\r\n\r\nquick-fix of holding back on CPF restoration.  Mr Yao and\r\n\r\nMdm Yacob have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntalked  about the efforts that we have tried to  make  in\r\n\r\ngetting companies to address this to shorten those salary\r\n\r\nscales,  and  that  it has been very tough.   My  concern\r\n\r\nreally  is that, if you take that pressure off by  taking\r\n\r\nthe easy route, and legislating CPF is actually very easy\r\n\r\n-  we  have some debate on this in Parliament and at  the\r\n\r\nend  of  the day, we go ahead and do it.  It is  an  easy\r\n\r\nthing to do.  But it is not necessarily the right answer.\r\n\r\nIn  doing it, you are taking that pressure off constantly\r\n\r\npushing  to  really fix a fundamental problem,  which  is\r\n\r\nthose  seniority-based pay systems.  By  doing  this,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  and  we  can  argue  about  the  effectiveness  or\r\n\r\notherwise,  it  is  counter-productive.   You  take   the\r\n\r\npressure  off,  people will stop and say,  \"OK,  we  have\r\n\r\nfixed  part of the problem. CPF for this group is  less.\"\r\n\r\nSo there is less pressure to go for the real root causes.\r\n\r\nThat, I think, is a concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM has said that we will not neglect and continue\r\n\r\nto  work  on  flexi  wage systems  and  skills  upgrading\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  But these are the other things that if we do\r\n\r\nnot  have  the  pressure  on, I think  we  might  end  up\r\n\r\nrelaxing  a little bit or waiting for the next time  that\r\n\r\nwe  need  to  go  on for more CPF related  changes.   The\r\n\r\nCommittee  has said that these changes will  enhance  the\r\n\r\nflexibility  of  our  overall wage  structure.   And  the\r\n\r\nCommittee has called upon companies to make up  to  their\r\n\r\nproductive older workers through variable bonus and other\r\n\r\nsuch  payments.  I am not so sanguine that this is  going\r\n\r\nto happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truly, how many Members of the House really believe\r\n\r\nthat  this is going to happen.  Productive older  workers\r\n\r\nwill  be rewarded in a good company with variable bonuses\r\n\r\nand  such  in the same way as productive younger workers.\r\n\r\nBut they are not going to be selectively given more, just\r\n\r\nto  make  up  for  the  CPF cut that the  Government  has\r\n\r\nmandated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there was a newspaper article on SingTech,\r\n\r\nand here was one company which was supposedly saying they\r\n\r\nwould  respond.  The headline was very nice, and it said,\r\n\r\n\"SingTech to compensate older workers\".  However, if  you\r\n\r\nread the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontent  of  that  article, basically  what  the  CEO  of\r\n\r\nSingTech said was that good, older workers will  get  the\r\n\r\nsame  reward as the younger ones, not that they will  get\r\n\r\nactually more, to compensate and make up for the CPF cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reiterate, CPF is a scheme to help people with\r\n\r\ntheir retirement needs.  It is not a way to fix wage cost\r\n\r\nproblems  and it is not a way to enhance the  flexibility\r\n\r\nof  wage  structure for workers.  Anything we do  through\r\n\r\nlegislation,  and CPF contribution rates are  legislated,\r\n\r\nnever   enhances   flexibility.   Legislation,   on   the\r\n\r\ncontrary, builds rigidity into the system.  Not  only  is\r\n\r\nCPF  a  blunt instrument but, in this instance, it  is  a\r\n\r\nwrong instrument.  I ask the Government to reconsider its\r\n\r\nacceptance on this proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nclear  to  us  that  the  main  objective  of  the   Sub-Committee's  recommendations  is  to  strike  a   balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the social objective of ensuring adequate  funds\r\n\r\nin  the  CPF  for retirees and the economic objective  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining  the cost competitiveness of  our  workforce.\r\n\r\nBoth  objectives are noble and enlightened ones and there\r\n\r\nmust be a flexible balance between them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In previous years, this balance could be shifted one\r\n\r\nway  or the other without extracting an onerous price  on\r\n\r\nthe  part of the employees.  For example, in the  1986-87\r\n\r\nrecession, CPF rates, then standing at a hefty  50%  were\r\n\r\nslashed  by  more  than  half, to  get  us  out  of  that\r\n\r\nrecession quickly and decisively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, those were the days when the cost of living\r\n\r\nwas  not  as  high as they are now.  A reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nemployer's contribution to the employee's CPF then  could\r\n\r\nand  did  materially reduce business costs,  while  still\r\n\r\nenabling workers to sustain themselves after retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, Sir, we are now caught in a conundrum,\r\n\r\nnot  mainly of this country's own making, but  for  which\r\n\r\nlower-income  employees have to bear the  brunt  of  this\r\n\r\nlatest revision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that this conundrum is not of our own making\r\n\r\nbecause I fully understand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  imperative of keeping ourselves globally competitive\r\n\r\nin an age when less developing countries are aggressively\r\n\r\nchallenging  us  for precious investment  dollars.   Wage\r\n\r\ncost  is, of course, one part of the total business costs\r\n\r\nthat   investors  look  into  before  making   investment\r\n\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the feedback of many is that, in re-juggling our CPF system to achieve wage competitiveness\r\n\r\nin  our  labour  force,  one  group  of  workers  may  be\r\n\r\nsuffering the main burden of such an adjustment, that is,\r\n\r\nthose between 50-55 years old.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sub-Committee's recommendations to keep\r\n\r\nemployers'  contribution to 16%, while also reducing  the\r\n\r\nemployee's  contribution to 16%, is meant to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nemployability  of  this  group of  employees  in  a  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, many in this age bracket are faced with the\r\n\r\nprospect of ever-increasing costs of living expenses over\r\n\r\nthe  longer  term.  They may get to enjoy a higher  take-home  pay  in  the shorter term, but over the  course  of\r\n\r\ntheir  retirement  years,  with  employer's  contribution\r\n\r\ncapped at 16%, they may actually not have enough in their\r\n\r\naccounts  to see them through to the end of their  lives.\r\n\r\nIt  has been advocated that reduction would make it  more\r\n\r\nappealing for employers to retain the services  of  those\r\n\r\nin  the  50-55  age group.  Employers will  not  have  to\r\n\r\nretrench  them  in view of their higher costs.   However,\r\n\r\nsuch a view has certain embedded assumptions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Sub-Committee is correct to assume that\r\n\r\nmost companies in Singapore are paying their staff on the\r\n\r\nbasis of a rigidified seniority-based grade system.   But\r\n\r\nthere  are also companies in Singapore that have  already\r\n\r\nshifted  to  a performance-based system or a  competency-based one, according to which, age does not matter in the\r\n\r\ndetermination of one's salary.  We should be  encouraging\r\n\r\nmore    companies    to    shift   to   performance-based\r\n\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the proposed reduction in the employer's\r\n\r\ncontribution rate to 16% -\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhen  younger age groups see theirs going  up  to  20%  - would  it  signal to the business sector that it  is  all\r\n\r\nright to discriminate against older workers simply on the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  their  age?   If performance  is  what  really\r\n\r\nmatters, why should age be the basis on which some people\r\n\r\nget less for doing the same, if not more, work than those\r\n\r\nof the other age categories?  Furthermore, would not such\r\n\r\na  recommendation reinforce stereotypes  among  employers\r\n\r\nthat  older  employees are less productive  than  younger\r\n\r\nones?  How can we ensure that such a perception does  not\r\n\r\nget ingrained into our system?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is also the assumption that\r\n\r\ncompanies  are driven to retrench these older workers  by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of the increase in business costs, as represented\r\n\r\nby the employer's CPF contributions.  However, there have\r\n\r\nbeen  some  voices emanating from respectable members  of\r\n\r\nthe   business  community  that  the  4-percentage  point\r\n\r\nreduction,  by itself, is probably not sufficient  enough\r\n\r\nto  make  a  major impact.  In other words, there  is  no\r\n\r\ncompelling  reason for us to assume that,  by  swallowing\r\n\r\nthis  bitter pill, older workers will automatically  face\r\n\r\nbetter job prospects than before.  As we all know,  since\r\n\r\n1999,  employer's CPF contribution rate for  all  workers\r\n\r\nwas  cut  to  16%  from the previous 20%.   Has  this  4-percentage  point reduction substantially contributed  to\r\n\r\nincreased prospects of employability for older workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sub-Committee also cites the figure that out of\r\n\r\nthe 110,000 workers in the 50-55 age bracket, 11% are now\r\n\r\nout  of  a job.  There might be other explanatory factors\r\n\r\nthat  account  for such a figure.  For example,  many  of\r\n\r\nthose  in  this  age  category  might  have  taken  early\r\n\r\nretirement.  Furthermore, many in this age category might\r\n\r\nnot   possess  enough  skills,  knowledge  and  education\r\n\r\nnecessary for the new economy.  In other words, the  Sub-Committee's  assumption, that cost  is  the  main  factor\r\n\r\ndetermining the employment prospects of these  employees,\r\n\r\nmay  be a dubious one.  While I believe that cost is  one\r\n\r\nreason that affects the employment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprospects of older employees, it is one among many.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the other crucial factors could include the\r\n\r\nneed  for retraining and upgrading the knowledge base  of\r\n\r\nthese  employees, the need to prevent age  discrimination\r\n\r\nin  the work place, and the need to move towards a purely\r\n\r\nperformance-based salary system, one that  is  free  from\r\n\r\nprejudices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a related matter, the Sub-Committee has also\r\n\r\nrecommended a reduction in the CPF Ordinary Account  rate\r\n\r\nfrom  the present 22% for those aged 50-55 years to  14%.\r\n\r\nThis will mean that many people in this age category  may\r\n\r\nhave  difficulty servicing their housing loans,  as  less\r\n\r\nmoney  would  be  available for investments  in  housing.\r\n\r\nThis could also substantially affect those in their 40s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, what other measures would the\r\n\r\nGovernment  take  -  assuming  that  the  Sub-Committee's\r\n\r\nproposals  are  accepted - to ensure that this  group  of\r\n\r\nhome-owners  would  not find themselves  in  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere they would have to default on their loans, or  find\r\n\r\nit  difficult  to  cough up sufficient  cash  amounts  to\r\n\r\nensure their own serviceability?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the impact of the\r\n\r\nlowering  of the CPF contribution ceiling from $6,000  to\r\n\r\n$5,000, many find themselves in a double-bind.  Not  only\r\n\r\nwill  they  see the employers' contribution to their  CPF\r\n\r\naccounts  capped at the current 16% for the first  $5,000\r\n\r\nthey earn when every other age group see theirs going up,\r\n\r\nthey  will also be subject to zero contribution from  the\r\n\r\nemployers  for anything they earn above $5,000.   If  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  are accepted in its entirety,  they  are\r\n\r\nrequesting that the Government also look into their needs\r\n\r\nand  not  blithely  assume that they  can  take  care  of\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In raising the CPF wage bands from $200-363 to $500-750, we increase the take-home pay for the low-wage and\r\n\r\npart-time  workers,  helping them to meet  their  current\r\n\r\nneeds and encouraging more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto   enter   the   workforce.   The   downside   of   the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  is  the  concern that  this  category  of\r\n\r\nemployees will have very little in their CPF.   It  would\r\n\r\nbe  very  difficult  to build up sufficiently  for  their\r\n\r\nretirement, housing and health care, ie, for their future\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cap on the maximum use of CPF for housing is a\r\n\r\nprudent recommendation, and the announcement of a pension\r\n\r\nscheme to enhance the investment value of our CPF savings\r\n\r\ngives a ray of hope for better yields.  It would be  good\r\n\r\nfor  public education to be mounted, so that CPF  members\r\n\r\nare instructed and informed on how the scheme would work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This calls for a fundamental shift in the mindset of\r\n\r\nour  decision-makers and people.  The challenges  include\r\n\r\nmanaging   the   mindset,   timing   and   readiness   of\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the  recommendations  of   the   Sub-Committee.   The  revamp of the CPF is one  of  the  many\r\n\r\nitems in the remaking of Singapore.  We must not lose our\r\n\r\nperspective when we experience change.  This is where  we\r\n\r\nmust  seek  a balance in handling differences and  coping\r\n\r\nwith  change.   Very often, we know that we are  besieged\r\n\r\nwith  both rational and emotive feelings that swing  like\r\n\r\npendulums  in  this whole exercise of remaking  Singapore\r\n\r\ninto  a  globally  competitive nation  of  resilient  and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government should accept the recommendations,\r\n\r\nit  is urgent for us to demonstrate our actions to assist\r\n\r\nthose  affected,  through  giving  them  a  channel   for\r\n\r\ndialogue.   I  would  like  to  urge  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nconstantly  reinforce and encourage  employer  groups  to\r\n\r\nshare their gains from the cost savings.  Employer groups\r\n\r\nmust  be  conscious that they do not end  up  giving  lip\r\n\r\nservice and, on their own, to walk the talk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all NWC deliberations and recommendations, the\r\n\r\ntripartite  parties must continue to urge employers,  who\r\n\r\ncould  well afford, to make up to the deserving  ones  in\r\n\r\nthe  above-50 age group for the difference in  their  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal has advocated wage flexibility as a\r\n\r\nreason  for the reduction in CPF but, in the same breath,\r\n\r\nit  has  also  mentioned that CPF should not be  tinkered\r\n\r\nfurther.   I  support  the  philosophy  of  having   wage\r\n\r\nflexibility  for  a more viable business  operation  but,\r\n\r\nwhere in the longer term it is necessary for us to review\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  rates  for reinstatement for this  category  of\r\n\r\npeople, we must not close the door there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As rightly pointed out, we are concerned that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  may  not  have  enough  savings  for  their\r\n\r\nretirement,   explaining  the   need   to   reverse   the\r\n\r\ncontribution  to 40% for those below 50.   Not  too  long\r\n\r\nfrom now, the majority of our working population would be\r\n\r\nin  the  above-50  age category.  With the  bulk  of  the\r\n\r\nworking population in the above-50 age group, it begs the\r\n\r\nquestion whether they would be financially sufficient for\r\n\r\ntheir  retirement needs and, therefore, a review  of  the\r\n\r\nCPF may make sense.  Instead of using age as a factor for\r\n\r\nCPF rate, company financial performance could be used  to\r\n\r\ndetermine the CPF rate payable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if it makes sense to do so, the Government\r\n\r\ncould  facilitate  these  organisations  by  way  of  tax\r\n\r\nincentives  in proportion to the number of  employees  in\r\n\r\nthe  age group of 50-55 who have been retained in service\r\n\r\nor  are  being employed from among the unemployed.   Such\r\n\r\nincentives would address the so-called wage costs of  the\r\n\r\n50-55, without disrupting the CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I agree that we want to nurture a resilient\r\n\r\ngroup of people capable of looking after themselves  but,\r\n\r\nat  the same time, while weaning off from mum's milk,  we\r\n\r\nmust also make available and accessible cow's milk.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  employers  must  be encouraged  to  mount  more\r\n\r\nfinancial   planning  programmes  for   their   employees\r\n\r\nreaching  50  years  of age, and more awareness  must  be\r\n\r\ncreated  in financial planning for this group of  people.\r\n\r\nIn  this, perhaps the Government could also facilitate by\r\n\r\nsubsidising   and  supporting  such  financial   planning\r\n\r\nprogrammes for the affected people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the Ministerial\r\n\r\nStatement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Debate be now adjourned.\" - [Mr Mah Bow\r\n\r\nTan].\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, resumption of debate,\r\n\r\nwhat day?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Withdrawal)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURMNENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Withdrawal)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I wish to inform Members that Ms\r\n\r\nBraema  Mathiaparanam has given notice  to  withdraw  her\r\n\r\nright to raise a matter on a Motion of Adjournment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Mah Bow\r\n\r\nTan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Four minutes to Seven o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TAXES 2001/2002</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and Minister for Finance how much in taxes,  by\r\n\r\neach tax bracket, were due from women and from men in the\r\n\r\nfinancial year 2001/2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax is collected on a Year of Assessment\r\n\r\nbasis.

The  CDCs  have  helped  almost   15,000\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries  with  financial  assistance  amounting  to\r\n\r\n$14.99 million between April 2001 and March 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various schemes have specific eligibility\r\n\r\ncriteria to meet certain policy objectives.  For example,\r\n\r\na  beneficiary  under the Public Assistance  Scheme  must\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the  criteria  that he/she  is  unable  to  work\r\n\r\nbecause of age, illness or disability and has no means of\r\n\r\nsubsistence as well as no one to depend on.  On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  CDCs also administer the Interim (Short-Term)\r\n\r\nFinancial  Assistance Scheme (IFAS) where the  amount  of\r\n\r\nassistance is based on Public Assistance rates, with each\r\n\r\ncase  assessed  on its own merits. The  officers  take  a\r\n\r\nholistic  approach by looking at both the  individual  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  family circumstances before rendering the  most\r\n\r\nappropriate form of assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides on-the-job training, the CDC officers\r\n\r\nundergo training to equip them with the skills to  assess\r\n\r\nand  handle applications for social assistance.  MCDS  is\r\n\r\nalso  organising a joint CDC-FSC training package  to  be\r\n\r\nlaunched  in  August  2002 to strengthen  the  networking\r\n\r\nbetween staff dealing with low-income families.
