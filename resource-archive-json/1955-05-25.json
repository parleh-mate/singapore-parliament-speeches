Davies):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is perhaps a historic occasion, for it is\r\n\r\nthe  first time that a Legislature of this colony has\r\n\r\nbeen empowered to determine and regulate, by law, its\r\n\r\nprivileges,  immunities and powers and those  of  its\r\n\r\nMembers. That power stems from the provisions of  the\r\n\r\nColonial  Laws Validity Act of 1865, and it has  been\r\n\r\nexpressly conferred on this Assembly by section 65 of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Colony Order in Council in  1955.  The\r\n\r\nonly  limitation on that power is that our privileges\r\n\r\nand immunities shall not exceed those of the House of\r\n\r\nCommons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  United  Kingdom, and it is  this  limitation\r\n\r\nwhich   has  given  the  draftsmen  of  this  measure\r\n\r\nconsiderable  anxiety  and concern,  because  Members\r\n\r\nrealise  the  powers and privileges of the  House  of\r\n\r\nCommons  are  not  found concisely or comprehensively\r\n\r\nset  out in any statute or, for that matter,  in  any\r\n\r\ninstrument.  They  have  been developed  through  the\r\n\r\ncenturies by trial and experiment, and they now  form\r\n\r\na  complex  law in which only experts  are  fully  at\r\n\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore been compelled to look for some\r\n\r\nstatute  or  ordinance which defines the  powers  and\r\n\r\nprivileges of colonial legislatures, and we have been\r\n\r\nadvised   by   experts  on  Parliamentary  procedure,\r\n\r\nparticularly those officers employed at the Table  of\r\n\r\nthe   House  of  Commons,  to  take  as  models   the\r\n\r\nordinances  of Nigeria and Kenya which have  received\r\n\r\ntheir  approval and, indeed, their blessing. We  have\r\n\r\naccepted  this  advice, and the  provisions  of  this\r\n\r\nBill,   as  indicated  in  the  Objects  and  Reasons\r\n\r\nattached  to  the  printed copy of the  Bill,  follow\r\n\r\nthose  models  very  closely with only  those  formal\r\n\r\nadaptations  which are strictly necessary  for  local\r\n\r\napplication.   In   these  circumstances,   I   would\r\n\r\nearnestly ask Members of this Legislative Assembly to\r\n\r\naccept  the provisions of this Bill without  question\r\n\r\nand without cavil, and I hope that that plea will  be\r\n\r\nindulgently accepted by hon.

By\r\n\r\nway of analogy, I have referred to that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the House of Commons, as I understand it,\r\n\r\nthere  are  special committees to  which  things  are\r\n\r\nusually  referred by the House - Select Committees  and\r\n\r\nStanding   Committees.   And   there   is   a   clear\r\n\r\ndistinction,   as  I  understand  it,   between   the\r\n\r\nproceedings of a Select Committee and the proceedings\r\n\r\nof  a  Standing Committee of the House.  In  Standing\r\n\r\nCommittees  all deliberations are open to  the  Press\r\n\r\nand  can be published day by day; but there has  been\r\n\r\nno  such  distinction  made here,  perhaps  for  good\r\n\r\nreason.

For a long,\r\n\r\nlong  time,  while  I  was  in  the  old  Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil,  I kept on pressing and pressing for  a  new\r\n\r\nLabour  Code;  and therefore when I  found  that  the\r\n\r\nLabour Bill was an accomplished fact, I lost no  time\r\n\r\nin  introducing it for First Reading at  our  sitting\r\n\r\nlast month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went through the Bill, Sir, in greater detail\r\n\r\nbefore  sending  it for printing, and  I  found  that\r\n\r\namendments are necessary in several of the provisions\r\n\r\nto  meet  present-day requirements. These  amendments\r\n\r\nare  under urgent consideration, and the matter  will\r\n\r\nbe finalised shortly.

Members of this Assembly are, I am sure, aware\r\n\r\nof  the fact that the situation in Chinese schools in\r\n\r\nSingapore  needs an overall investigation  to  enable\r\n\r\nthe  Committee  to make suitable recommendations  for\r\n\r\nthe  improvement of Chinese education, so  that  this\r\n\r\nColony will move towards self-government and ultimate\r\n\r\nindependence in Singapore in an orderly fashion.  The\r\n\r\nquestion  is  of such an important and  grave  nature\r\n\r\nthat  I  have  sought the assent of this Assembly  to\r\n\r\ndispense  with the notice, with a view to  making  it\r\n\r\npossible  for  the Committee to go into the  question\r\n\r\nwith all speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Committee come from all political\r\n\r\nParties  that  are represented in this House,  and  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  they  will  present  different  constructive\r\n\r\nviews. It is the Government's intention to seek views\r\n\r\nfrom   public  bodies,  any  persons  interested   in\r\n\r\neducation, in fact, from all quarters, to enable the\r\n\r\nCommittee  to  make recommendations for consideration\r\n\r\nby the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that the schools concerned,\r\n\r\nnamely  the  Chung Cheng High School and the  Chinese\r\n\r\nHigh  School, have now resumed normally and that  the\r\n\r\nstudents have resumed their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudies  in  a  normal manner.

Marshall):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek the privilege of seconding this\r\n\r\nmotion,  and  in  so  doing I  seek  to  clarify  our\r\n\r\nposition  and our attitude to the recent  conduct  of\r\n\r\nstudents in certain Chinese middle schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have blindly supported and incited strikers\r\n\r\nwithout  understanding the issues.  They  have  taken\r\n\r\npart  in  demonstrations of defiance. Some even  have\r\n\r\nbeen  party  to  acts  of  horrible  brutality.   And\r\n\r\nfinally, Sir, they have blatantly flouted constituted\r\n\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Government moved to punish the immediate\r\n\r\nculprits, these students organised wholesale defiance\r\n\r\nand, working on the racial emotions of parents and of\r\n\r\nlabour,  they threatened further considerable  strife\r\n\r\nwithout regard to truth or justice, or the welfare of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  this  country.  The  manoeuvring  of\r\n\r\nCommunists   behind  the  scenes  had  succeeded   in\r\n\r\nbringing  about among a decent people  strong  racial\r\n\r\nemotions, blindly antagonistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a very high regard for the Chinese\r\n\r\nparent, both the non-British and British subject.  He\r\n\r\nis   usually  a  sober,  solid,  sensible,  peaceable\r\n\r\nperson.  That  these parents should have  been  drawn\r\n\r\ninto the vortex of blind emotions was a matter of the\r\n\r\ndeepest  concern  to  us.  The  punishment   of   the\r\n\r\nimmediate  culprits lost significance  in  the  wider\r\n\r\nissue - the vital issue - an issue which every member  of\r\n\r\nour  Chinese  population must now face  for  himself,\r\n\r\nmust  now  ask of himself: Is Singapore my  permanent\r\n\r\nhome? Am I going to respect the other communities  in\r\n\r\nthis  territory, and work in harmony  and  friendship\r\n\r\nwith  them,  to  build  a  glorious  new  palace   of\r\n\r\nindependence  of which I will be a strong  and  loyal\r\n\r\npillar? That is the issue, Sir, that we would like to\r\n\r\nsee  resolved  in  the  peace and  the  calm  of  the\r\n\r\nindividual's  own soul, free from mass demonstrations\r\n\r\nand  mass  emotions.  It is an issue  which  must  be\r\n\r\nclearly faced, and frankly answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has been told - we have been accused - that\r\n\r\nour   action,   and  our  inaction,  has   undermined\r\n\r\nauthority.  We  are told that our  son  has  publicly\r\n\r\ncocked  his snook at us, and our other sons stand  by\r\n\r\nwondering   at   our  forbearance,  perturbed,   even\r\n\r\ndismayed. Some have cried out that we should use  the\r\n\r\nwhip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our son is as one who is ill. He lies stricken\r\n\r\nwith  the chicken-pox, his body a mass of red  spots,\r\n\r\nand  the  more we forbid him to scratch, the more  he\r\n\r\nstubbornly  scratches, and the  more  those  spots suppurate. What would you have us do? Use a knife  to\r\n\r\nexcoriate  those red spots? Take down  the  whip  and\r\n\r\nlash out in a frenzy of hurt pride, and then weep  at\r\n\r\nthe  damage we have done? This, Sir, is not the  time\r\n\r\nfor  the whip, or the knife. I have no pride  in  the\r\n\r\nface of this illness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese people, Sir, are the very heart in our\r\n\r\nbody  politic.  They are the blood in our  veins.  To\r\n\r\nharm them would destroy all. It would destroy forever\r\n\r\nthe  glorious future now within our grasp of  a  free\r\n\r\nand  independent people, working together as brothers\r\n\r\nin  love and in mutual respect. This, Sir, is a time,\r\n\r\nin  our  view,  for gentle nursing.  Age-old  Chinese\r\n\r\nwisdom   and   Chinese  stability,   working   on   a\r\n\r\nconstitution  that is basically sound,  will  restore\r\n\r\nthis  son  to  health, and we will be  proud  of  our\r\n\r\nChinese  son. Friends think us weak; others  call  us\r\n\r\ncowards. They will not deflect us from our vision  of\r\n\r\na united people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task before us, Sir, is a tremendous one - a task\r\n\r\nto win the confidence of our Chinese people, a people\r\n\r\nwho  have had considerable cause for complaint in the\r\n\r\npast.  In  humility, and with all we have,  we  shall\r\n\r\nseek  to  gain that confidence and to gain  that  co-operation  which  is  absolutely  necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of all races in this territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a poet once wrote that \"Thoughts in hours of\r\n\r\ninsight  willed can be in hours of gloom  fulfilled.\"\r\n\r\nIn  the  days of gloom through which we have  passed,\r\n\r\nour  guiding light has been our firm desire to  bring\r\n\r\nto our Chinese people a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrealisation  of  their great role in the  independent\r\n\r\nMalaya of tomorrow, a realisation that the rich broad\r\n\r\nriver  of  Chinese  culture is  not  limited  to  the\r\n\r\npresent-day political manifestation of their homeland\r\n\r\nwhich  is  based on foreign concepts. It is our  hope\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  realise their future  is  here,  in\r\n\r\nfriendship and harmony and loyal co-operation with all\r\n\r\nraces,  to build this new nation which is our deepest\r\n\r\ndesire.  It is in this spirit that the motion  before\r\n\r\nyou  is  conceived, and it is my privilege,  Sir,  to\r\n\r\nsecond it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we would like\r\n\r\nto  assure  hon.  Members here that  the  Progressive\r\n\r\nParty will do its utmost to promote Chinese education\r\n\r\nand culture. This involves recommendations on a long-term  policy, and if the motion moved is strictly  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with this aim alone, it will receive  our\r\n\r\nwholehearted support. However, I must point out  that\r\n\r\nthe  motion  today  differs  from  that  of  a  Press\r\n\r\nrelease,  issued by the Council of Ministers sometime\r\n\r\nlast  week.  With your indulgence, Sir, I shall  read\r\n\r\nout the relevant part for purposes of comparison.  As\r\n\r\nit stands today, the motion reads thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To investigate the situation in Chinese schools in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  to  make  recommendations   for   the\r\n\r\nimprovement and strengthening of Chinese education in\r\n\r\nthe interests of Chinese culture and orderly progress\r\n\r\ntowards self-government and ultimate independence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official release is as follows.

We  would like  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nclarify  this point and to state the reasons for  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  for  the  change of  phraseology.  Is  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  to be appointed now responsible  not  only\r\n\r\nfor  the  making  of recommendations on  a  long-term\r\n\r\nbasis,  which we gladly accept, but also for  dealing\r\n\r\nwith any situation that may arise from day to day? On\r\n\r\nthis point, Sir, I must point out that the day-to-day\r\n\r\nadministration   is   the   responsibility   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. After all, I think I am right,  they  are\r\n\r\npaid for the job!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government is a Labour Front Government -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Sir,  I  have  great\r\n\r\nregard  for  the ability and capacity of  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  but  I should think the  improvement  of\r\n\r\nChinese culture is not one within their\r\n\r\npower!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, Sir, like to take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto express the views of the People's Action Party and\r\n\r\nof  many  people, who are not members of the People's\r\n\r\nAction Party, but who bear similarly strong views  on\r\n\r\nthis  subject of Chinese and vernacular education  in\r\n\r\ngeneral. In my opinion, if this Committee is not,  as\r\n\r\nis feared by the Member for Serangoon, a rubber stamp\r\n\r\nto  pilot  the Government through a somewhat delicate\r\n\r\nand  difficult problem, if it is to be more - if it  is\r\n\r\nto  approach a very difficult problem and try to find\r\n\r\na  long-term solution to this problem, then the terms\r\n\r\nof reference should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpanded. But before we expand the terms of reference\r\n\r\nin which - [Interruption.] Before I seek to expand the\r\n\r\nterms  of  reference. I must never  forget  that  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister has got 18 votes in this  House!  But\r\n\r\nbefore  I seek to expand it, I would like to seek  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  terms of reference \"to  investigate  the\r\n\r\nsituation  in  Chinese schools in Singapore,  and  to\r\n\r\nmake   recommendations  for   the   improvement   and\r\n\r\nstrengthening  of Chinese education in the  interests\r\n\r\nof Chinese culture and orderly progress towards self-government  and ultimate independence in  Singapore\".\r\n\r\nNow,  Sir, that runs against the whole grain  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Action   Party,  to  think   of   ultimate\r\n\r\nindependence in Singapore as divorced from the  wider\r\n\r\nconcept  of independence in Malaya, and I would  seek\r\n\r\nto delete the words \"in Singapore\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I would seek to add \"and to review the whole\r\n\r\npolicy   of  English  and  vernacular  education   in\r\n\r\nSingapore in   order   to  formulate   a   considered\r\n\r\nlinguistic policy for an independent Malaya\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister has referred to the fears\r\n\r\nand uneasiness of a large section of the non-Chinese-speaking population in Singapore and in Malaya at the\r\n\r\nhappenings that he has referred to in recent  months.\r\n\r\nI  think  there is one basic principle which we  must\r\n\r\nresolve  if  we  are  to  convince,  what  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister has said, the stolid, sensible and - I  forgot\r\n\r\nhis other \"s\" - the stolid, sensible and - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

But, nevertheless,\r\n\r\nwe  must face it. One of the greatest difficulties in\r\n\r\ninstilling confidence in Chinese schools in Malaya is\r\n\r\nthe fear that either\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  conscious or subconscious policy of the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  Malaya  is the Anglicization  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese  in  this country - a policy which  may  reduce\r\n\r\nChinese  into  a  secondary  language  in  their  own\r\n\r\nChinese schools. It is this basic predilection, but a\r\n\r\nfact  which  must  be faced, that  we  must  resolve.\r\n\r\nBefore we can resolve that, we must be able to review\r\n\r\nthe  whole position and then to decide whither we are\r\n\r\ngoing.  All this talk of multi-lingualism,  all  this\r\n\r\ndemand   for   multi-lingualism,   has   got    wider\r\n\r\nimplications  than just voting people whom  you  like\r\n\r\ninto either the Legislative Chamber or, (now it would\r\n\r\nappear  not),  the City and Island Council.  It  goes\r\n\r\nright down to the root of our educational policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a free and independent Malaya in which every\r\n\r\nChinese, every Indian, every Malay, will no longer be\r\n\r\nChinese,  Malay or Indian but Malayan, what  language\r\n\r\nor  languages  shall  they speak?  What  language  or\r\n\r\nlanguages shall the Government use? What language  or\r\n\r\nlanguages will be acceptable to the people? What  are\r\n\r\nthe  language  or  languages of  an  independent  and\r\n\r\ndemocratic Malaya? They are thorny, delicate problems\r\n\r\nwhich many politicians would prefer to defer to  some\r\n\r\nother day, when the problem should again reappear  in\r\n\r\nacute  form. But I feel if we are to face, to  solve,\r\n\r\nthis  situation, we must be able to clear our  minds,\r\n\r\nand  the  minds of the public, in the  way  that  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister has said. Where do we stand  in  this\r\n\r\nindependent  Malaya? The Malays  want  to  know.  The\r\n\r\nIndians  want to know. And the Chinese want to  know.\r\n\r\nThey are all going to be Malayans in this independent\r\n\r\nMalaya, or they will leave this country. But they all\r\n\r\nspeak  their own languages. They all have  their  own\r\n\r\nbias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of the colonial government\r\n\r\nhitherto - perhaps   subconsciously,    perhaps    even\r\n\r\nconsciously - has    been   one    of    Anglicization.\r\n\r\nMalayanisation has been equated to Anglicization -  to\r\n\r\nproduce  a Malayan nation by making them all English,\r\n\r\nor  learn  English, or learn about Francis Drake  and\r\n\r\nhis bowls, and Sir Walter Raleigh and his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncloak, and daffodils and buttercups, which they  have\r\n\r\nnever  seen. This policy I think we must review,  and\r\n\r\nwe  must reformulate. We cannot resolve the situation\r\n\r\nin  Chinese  schools  as long  as  they - the  parents,\r\n\r\nteachers, principals and students - feel that there is\r\n\r\na conscious or even subconscious attempt to introduce\r\n\r\nmore  and more English into the Chinese schools. They\r\n\r\nfear  one day the Chinese language in Chinese schools\r\n\r\nwill  be  reduced  to  a secondary  language,  as  is\r\n\r\nalready  happening in Malay schools, where  there  is\r\n\r\nthis  new  policy  of  Malayanisation.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Housing can confirm this - that there  was\r\n\r\na  definite policy to introduce the English  language\r\n\r\nto such an extent in Malay schools that Malay parents\r\n\r\nwere  alarmed that their children will no  longer  be\r\n\r\nMalays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if we allow each community to go on its\r\n\r\nown  way  and  stir up all these extreme  prejudices,\r\n\r\nthen we are going to have a very difficult problem of\r\n\r\nsynthesizing  or  composing various individual  units\r\n\r\nwhich  may then never merge. But we, I think,  unlike\r\n\r\nthe  colonial  government, cannot  afford  to  ignore\r\n\r\nbasic  likes and dislikes - basic facts. One  of  these\r\n\r\nbasic facts is that no racial or linguistic group  in\r\n\r\nthis  country will give up its own language, its  own\r\n\r\nculture,  its own traditions, completely  for  either\r\n\r\nEnglish  or  any  other Anglicized  form  of  Malayan\r\n\r\nlanguage,  culture, or tradition. But we  must  solve\r\n\r\nit,  and  it can be solved. In fact, it is  the  only\r\n\r\nway,  or  we must give up. If we cannot resolve  this\r\n\r\nproblem, then we must resign ourselves to a Malaya in\r\n\r\nwhich there will be internecine strife for years, and\r\n\r\nyears,  and  years.  I believe  there  are  men  with\r\n\r\nsufficient  goodwill and - if I may borrow yet  another\r\n\r\nphrase  from  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister - men  of\r\n\r\nstature, in the Chinese, in the Malay, in the  Indian\r\n\r\nand  in  the other communities, who will be  able  to\r\n\r\nrise up to the situation, to rise up to this problem.\r\n\r\nIf  you can resolve this point now, in the context of\r\n\r\nan  independent  Malaya which we  are  all  going  to\r\n\r\nbuild, then I say we are opening up the way, we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblazing a new trail. If we cannot, then we have  just\r\n\r\nkept  this  problem  for the  future  when  it  would\r\n\r\nprobably   reappear  in  an  even  more   acute   and\r\n\r\nunpleasant  form. And it is for this  reason  that  I\r\n\r\nseek  to  extend  the  terms  of  reference  of  this\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I must remind the Member for Serangoon that\r\n\r\nthere  is no danger of this Committee being made  use\r\n\r\nof  as  a rubber stamp for the Government. Any member\r\n\r\nof  this Committee who feels that the recommendations\r\n\r\nand  deliberations are contrary to his belief, or the\r\n\r\nbelief  of  his Party, has got the right to  dissent.\r\n\r\nBut  if this Committee is to do more than just to try\r\n\r\nand  patch up, or to bottle up, the present state  of\r\n\r\nthe  schools in Singapore, then it must resolve  this\r\n\r\nproblem.  Is  it  the  policy in  Singapore  to  have\r\n\r\nEnglish  introduced  more and  more  into  Malay  and\r\n\r\nChinese  schools? Is it the policy to  allow  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation  to  go  on  uninhibited  in  a  completely\r\n\r\nChinese  orientated way? Similarly,  with  Malay  and\r\n\r\nIndian   education.  Is  that  the  policy  of   this\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the Singapore Labour  Front - U.M.N.O. - M.C.A. - M.I.C. and  Malay  Unions?  Or  is  it  their\r\n\r\npolicy,  with  the support of other Parties  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  to formulate a policy which will last,  which\r\n\r\nwill lead us to an independent Malaya?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is to be the lingua franca - English? Have we\r\n\r\ndecided?  Have we made up our minds? Have the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  and  the people of Malaya  decided  on\r\n\r\nthat?  Is  the  introduction of multi-lingualism  the\r\n\r\nforerunner  of riotous confusion, as the  Progressive\r\n\r\nParty  so often so riotously expressed it? Or are  we\r\n\r\nin  our  inarticulate ways trying to resolve  a  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  problem, a problem of  building  a  nation\r\n\r\nwhere  there  are  diverse  linguistic  and  cultural\r\n\r\ngroups,     where     cultural     and     linguistic\r\n\r\nsusceptibilities are restricted, so that it  may  fit\r\n\r\nwithin  the framework of national security,  national\r\n\r\naspirations?  I  would not like to suggest  what  the\r\n\r\nlanguages   ought  to  be  at  this  stage   of   the\r\n\r\nproceedings of a Committee which is yet to be formed.\r\n\r\nThe problem must be tackled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow.  It  cannot  be resolved just by  subconsciously\r\n\r\ncarrying   on  a  policy  instituted  by  a  colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment of introducing English into all schools in\r\n\r\nthe hope that, thereby, English would prevail in this\r\n\r\ncountry, and, thereby, we would all become Anglicized\r\n\r\nMalayans.  I  know the Minister for Local Government,\r\n\r\nLands  and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat)\r\n\r\nhas  very  strong  views on this  matter.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  we  cannot resolve the suspicion in  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools.  The  allegation, the charge,  is  seriously\r\n\r\nmeant,    seriously   intended - that   the    British\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  destroying the Chinese  language  and\r\n\r\nChinese  culture in these schools. You have  to  face\r\n\r\nthem.  One  could shrug, one could laugh it  off,  as\r\n\r\ncompletely ridiculous. But if one does not face  this\r\n\r\nproblem,  one will never resolve it. In  every  issue\r\n\r\nwhich  arises  over  the schools you  will  find  the\r\n\r\nmanagement committees, the teachers, the parents, not\r\n\r\nas  active supporters of - if I may borrow a phrase not\r\n\r\nfrom  the Chief Minister but from His Excellency  the\r\n\r\nGovernor -  \"constituted authority\". If  you  want  to\r\n\r\nfind  them behind \"constituted authority\", then  they\r\n\r\nmust  be  satisfied that \"constituted  authority\"  is\r\n\r\nbehind the things which they so basically desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I myself have been extremely careful not to\r\n\r\ncommit my Party or myself to any preconceived notions\r\n\r\non  this  subject. All we say is that there  is  this\r\n\r\nvery delicate problem. It must be dealt with, and  it\r\n\r\nis no use confining ourselves to purely temporary and\r\n\r\nephemeral measures which will bring about a  lull  in\r\n\r\nthese  schools, without resolving basic  causes.  And\r\n\r\nthis is one of the basic causes. There may be others,\r\n\r\nI  do  not  know. The Committee has not  started  its\r\n\r\ndeliberations. But I am confident that this is one of\r\n\r\nthe  causes  and we must resolve it. Whither  are  we\r\n\r\ngoing?  Is  it  going to be a Malaya  with  a  single\r\n\r\nlanguage imposed on all its subjects? Or is it  going\r\n\r\nto be a Malaya where various languages are allowed to\r\n\r\nfoster  and  to  flourish, but with a  common  thread\r\n\r\nrunning through them, with one lingua franca,  or  as\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Housing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould have it, one national language? What is to be\r\n\r\nthat lingua franca? These are problems which I think\r\n\r\nwe should seriously start to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that the Labour Front Government is\r\n\r\nthe  people's  government. I cannot agree  with  that\r\n\r\nbecause,  as the Hon. the Chief Minister will  admit,\r\n\r\nhe   had,  in  what  I  consider  more  disinterested\r\n\r\nmoments,  expressed  a  contrary  view.  It  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult for him but it is dangerous, this defending\r\n\r\nof   a  constitution  which  was  once  described  as\r\n\r\noutmoded, because that was the slippery slope at  the\r\n\r\nbottom of which lies the mangled political remains of\r\n\r\nhis once political opponent in Cairnhill. If you want\r\n\r\nthe  people  to  believe those things,  then  certain\r\n\r\nradical alterations must be made to the constitution.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  we  might start now by trying to  show  them\r\n\r\nthat we are prepared, that the Chief Minister and his\r\n\r\ncolleagues  are prepared, within what I  surely  will\r\n\r\nadmit are very conscribed limits, to start tackling a\r\n\r\nvery basic problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move this amendment to the motion, and it\r\n\r\nis  my hope that the Government will approach this is\r\n\r\namendment,  not  with an idea that the  P.A.P. seeks\r\n\r\npolitical  advantage, but that the  P.A.P. seeks  to\r\n\r\nhelp the Government resolve a very difficult problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nbefore I support the motion, I wish to make it clear\r\n\r\nto the House -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The original Question, as amended, is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that a Committee be appointed with the following terms of\r\n\r\nreference -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to investigate the situation in Chinese schools in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  to  make  recommendations  for  the\r\n\r\nimprovement and strengthening of Chinese  education\r\n\r\nin  the  interests of Chinese culture  and  orderly\r\n\r\nprogress   towards  self-government  and   ultimate\r\n\r\nindependence'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question now is that the following words be\r\n\r\nadded to the end of that Question: \"and to review the\r\n\r\nwhole  policy of English and vernacular education  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   in   order  to  formulate  a   considered\r\n\r\nlinguistic policy for an independent Malaya\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must confess\r\n\r\nI admire the temerity of the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nwho  asks  us  to  lay down a linguistic  policy  for\r\n\r\nMalaya without asking the Federation to assist us  in\r\n\r\nthat effort, but all seems possible to the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar.  He asks us to expand  the  terms  of\r\n\r\nreference  of this Committee which is now,  with  its\r\n\r\nlimited  reference, viewed with suspicion.  It  seems\r\n\r\nthe  Committee,  if  given these  additional  powers,\r\n\r\nwould  be  beyond  suspicion  and  quite  capable  of\r\n\r\nperforming its duties but, with the sole question  of\r\n\r\nreference being Chinese education, it must be  viewed\r\n\r\nwith suspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that as far as I can see, this\r\n\r\namendment  is  somewhat of a  quibble.  If  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  would  look a little more  carefully  at  the\r\n\r\nterms of reference, he would not ask these rhetorical\r\n\r\nquestions  with  which  we  have  been  this  morning\r\n\r\nbombarded. Where are we going? Quo Vadis! What is our\r\n\r\naim?  Are  we going to have Anglicization?  Would  he\r\n\r\nlook at those last words, \"in the interests of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese  culture and orderly progress  towards  self-\r\n\r\ngovernment and ultimate independence\"? So the  effort\r\n\r\nis not merely to strengthen Chinese education, but to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  it  in the interests of  Chinese  culture\r\n\r\nwithin the framework of orderly progress towards self-government and ultimate independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee, Sir, was chosen with the assistance\r\n\r\nand  at  the suggestion of the Committee of Selection\r\n\r\nof  this  House,  with  the  particular  question  of\r\n\r\nChinese education in mind, and the terms of reference\r\n\r\nwere  so framed that I, for one, though not a Member,\r\n\r\nwould understand that the Members are completely free\r\n\r\nand,  in  fact,  are compelled, in the  interests  of\r\n\r\nstrengthening Chinese education within the  framework\r\n\r\nof  our  movement towards an independent  Malaya,  to\r\n\r\nconsider  not  only  Chinese  education  in   Chinese\r\n\r\nschools, but the general education of Chinese  pupils\r\n\r\nin   schools   teaching  Chinese,  and  within   that\r\n\r\nframework,  it  seems to me, they would  be  free  to\r\n\r\nconsider  and  advise on matters of languages  to  be\r\n\r\ntaught in those schools other than Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my view, Sir, that to seek to burden the\r\n\r\nCommittee   with   parallel  issues   of   vernacular\r\n\r\neducation in other vernacular schools may impede what\r\n\r\nwe  desire  in the way of rapidity in recommendations\r\n\r\nand their early implementation. It is unquestionable,\r\n\r\nSir,  that this House must be seized of the fact that\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  education in  vernacular  schools,\r\n\r\nother   than  Chinese,  is  under  consideration   by\r\n\r\nGovernment.   The  reorganisation   of   our   entire\r\n\r\neducational  system is under consideration,  but  the\r\n\r\nrecent  unhappy  incidents, indicating  an  unhealthy\r\n\r\nposition in a very important sector of our community,\r\n\r\nmake  it imperative that we should now move with some\r\n\r\nrapidity  in order to clarify the issue  and  to  see\r\n\r\nwherein  lie  our  immediate  efforts  to  strengthen\r\n\r\nChinese   education  within  the  framework   of   an\r\n\r\nindependent Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)\r\n\r\nexpressed the fear that we may be seeking to use  the\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party as a rubber stamp for our  day-to-day problems. Now, Sir, I will confess that I have  a high\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregard for the abilities of the Progressive Party  as\r\n\r\na  rubber  stamp,  but I can assure them,  and  every\r\n\r\nMember  of this House, that this Government does  not\r\n\r\nuse  rubber  stamps and has no need for them  and,  I\r\n\r\nhope, never will. I am happy to inform the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon    that   the   idea   is   for   long-term\r\n\r\nrecommendations   in  order  to  strengthen   Chinese\r\n\r\neducation,  to  strengthen  discipline  within  those\r\n\r\nschools,  and  to  aim  at  fusing  strong  differing\r\n\r\ncultures into one whole - what my friend opposite,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar, describes as synthesising\r\n\r\nthe various cultures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess it is with some surprise that I heard\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Tanjong Pagar again  speak  of  the\r\n\r\nsuspicion that we seek to destroy Chinese culture  by\r\n\r\nAnglicization. The Committee, Sir, consists  of  nine\r\n\r\nmembers, of whom seven are Chinese, and eight of them\r\n\r\nwere  returned by the people in open elections. Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the impossibility of seeking to destroy culture\r\n\r\nwhich has survived, I am reliably informed, for seven\r\n\r\nthousand  years,  it  seems  to  me  the  height   of\r\n\r\nabsurdity  that  there should be  such  a  suggestion\r\n\r\nlevelled  against such a body, and if so levelled,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  see  how  the  expansion  of  the  terms   of\r\n\r\nreference would in any way give it a better basis for\r\n\r\nworking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\nI  did  not suggest that the suspicion exists against\r\n\r\nthe   Committee  which  this  House  will  this   day\r\n\r\nconstitute.

Now, I am moving for a Commission to  study\r\n\r\nthe  matter before we go too fast into it, and  I  am\r\n\r\naware  that I shall be accused of going too slow  and\r\n\r\nthat  we  ought  to  go faster and instantly  sign  a\r\n\r\nnotice  to the Traction Company, saying that  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  take  them over.

It is quite clear from the way some\r\n\r\npeople   talk   that  they  do  not  appreciate   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties   involved   in  nationalisation.   They\r\n\r\nenvisage  nothing more than a simple  transaction  by\r\n\r\nwhich  the State purchases an article and then  says,\r\n\r\n\"I  have  now nationalised it.\" If that was what  you\r\n\r\nare  doing with a motor-car, it would, of course,  be\r\n\r\nno more than a simple transaction. If the State wants\r\n\r\nto  buy  a  motor-car, they buy it  and  it  is  then\r\n\r\nnational property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are nationalising industry, it is a very\r\n\r\ndifferent  matter.  You are not dealing  merely  with\r\n\r\nrolling-stock  or  buildings  or  stores.   You   are\r\n\r\ndealing, much more importantly, with human beings. It\r\n\r\nis  not  the mere matter of a transfer of control  of\r\n\r\nthe  industry from private capitalist bureaucracy  to\r\n\r\npublic  state bureaucracy. Now, this is where you  do\r\n\r\nwant  to  be careful if you are a capitalist, because\r\n\r\ncapitalists  very often tend to talk pure  Communism.\r\n\r\nIt  is,  in fact, the Communist view that that simple\r\n\r\ntransfer of ownership is all that is necessary at the\r\n\r\nfirst  stage. They do regard it simply as a  straight\r\n\r\ndevelopment   from   private  capitalism   to   State\r\n\r\ncapitalism - I  shall come to that in due course - but  I\r\n\r\ndo  want  to  make  it clear that  there  is  a  real\r\n\r\ndifference  between nationalisation, as  we  envisage\r\n\r\nit,  and nationalisation, as capitalist-minded people\r\n\r\noften envisage it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend of mine was saying to me recently, about\r\n\r\ntwo days ago, that he could see only a hair's breadth\r\n\r\nof difference between social democracy and Communism.\r\n\r\nNow,  if  he had said there was only a hair's breadth\r\n\r\nof  difference  between capitalism and  Communism,  I\r\n\r\nshould  have  been very much inclined to  agree  with\r\n\r\nhim,  because both capitalism and Communism  seek  to\r\n\r\nhave a small powerful group, or gang, which dominates\r\n\r\nthe  economy  and  controls the State.  That  is  the\r\n\r\ntraditional  background of both  of  them.  They  are\r\n\r\nsisters under\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   skin.   Social  democracy  is   a   matter   of\r\n\r\ndistributing  freedom  and responsibility  throughout\r\n\r\nthe  social  system  as  far as  you  can,  and  does\r\n\r\nenvisage  not  the maximum control  by  the  smallest\r\n\r\ngroup of the elite that you can get together, but the\r\n\r\nmaximum  distribution that you can  achieve  and  the\r\n\r\ncontinually  developing distribution of  freedom  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility, so that you can, in the  end,  arrive\r\n\r\nat  your  fully free, fully harmonious  society.  The\r\n\r\nSocial  Democrat must reject the Marxist  idea  of  a\r\n\r\nvast lumpen proletariat and small cadres of the elite\r\n\r\nwho  organise  it into appropriate demonstrations  of\r\n\r\nsupport  and,  if  necessary,  bludgeon  the   lumpen\r\n\r\nproletariat into the policies that they want  carried\r\n\r\nout.  So  that  in  this matter of  taking  over  the\r\n\r\nTraction Company - and I am sure that there are  people\r\n\r\nwho, in spite of what I am saying, will want to go in\r\n\r\nfor  a  State capitalist type of transfer - I think  we\r\n\r\nought to examine the experience of other countries in\r\n\r\nregard  to  State capitalism. And we  had  better  go\r\n\r\nback, I think, to 1929 where Russia's First Five-Year\r\n\r\nPlan  says  that the workers' present-day  needs  are\r\n\r\nrepudiated  in  the  name of a monumental  historical\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in Russia that the techniques of State\r\n\r\ncapitalism have been developed and it is, of  course,\r\n\r\nin China today, where the Chinese People's Government\r\n\r\nis seeking to follow in that line. In the 1949 Common\r\n\r\nProgramme  of the People's Government, you will  find\r\n\r\nArticle 31 which says that \"the economy based on  co-operation of State capital and private capital is  of\r\n\r\na  State  capitalist nature. Whenever  necessary  and\r\n\r\npossible,  private  capital shall  be  encouraged  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  in the direction of State capitalism.\"  And,\r\n\r\nof  course Li Wei-han, a veteran Communist leader  in\r\n\r\nChina,  said  the  same  thing again  in  1953 - \"State\r\n\r\ncapitalism  is  the  first  step  in  the   socialist\r\n\r\ntransformation  of  private  industry   and   private\r\n\r\ncommerce.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communist view is that when you have completed\r\n\r\nthe  process of State capitalism, and taken over  the\r\n\r\nwhole economy under the direct control of the State\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbureaucracy,  you  then achieve the  lower  phase  of\r\n\r\nCommunism  and  you will pass on automatically,  they\r\n\r\nhope, into the higher phase of Communism, You can put\r\n\r\nit  more  simply, if you like, by saying  that  their\r\n\r\nview  is that you make the State machine all-powerful\r\n\r\nand,  by doing so, you destroy it. This is not a view\r\n\r\nthat  I  can accept at all. It is armchair theorising\r\n\r\nwhich  bears  no relation to the findings  of  modern\r\n\r\nresearch.  The  whole error and  evil  of  capitalist\r\n\r\nthinking - whether  it is private capitalist  or  State\r\n\r\ncapitalist - is that it values the machine too high and\r\n\r\nthe  human  being  too low. It is too  excited  about\r\n\r\ntechnology and about the possible advances in the use\r\n\r\nof  technology,  and it ignores the  rights  and  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the  human  beings  who  are  involved  in\r\n\r\ntechnological change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this sociological ignorance, when\r\n\r\nyou  make  a transfer from private ownership - as  with\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Traction Company - to State ownership, if\r\n\r\nyou  make it in this simple State capitalist type  of\r\n\r\ntransfer,  you  are liable to run into  very  serious\r\n\r\ndifficulties in your labour relations. The State,  as\r\n\r\nit  becomes  the owner, inherits all the  antagonisms\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been built up under private  capitalism.\r\n\r\nThe   class  relations  of  private  capitalism  have\r\n\r\nproduced  certain attitudes in the workers - attitudes\r\n\r\nof  suspicion,  attitudes  of  enmity,  attitudes  of\r\n\r\nfear - and when, by a stroke of the pen and signing  of\r\n\r\na  cheque,  you  take  over this  private  capitalist\r\n\r\nenterprise into public ownership, you are  liable  to\r\n\r\ncarry with your purchase all those ill-feelings which\r\n\r\ncan be so disastrous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Seletar (Mr M. P. D. Nair), in\r\n\r\nour  debate on the Governor's Address, suggested that\r\n\r\nthe  essential test of socialism was whether we  were\r\n\r\nprepared  to hurry blindly into State capitalism  for\r\n\r\nthis  matter  of transport. I hope I am  interpreting\r\n\r\nhim   correctly - he  will  have  an   opportunity   of\r\n\r\ninterpreting  his  own words later  on  if  he  wants\r\n\r\nto - but he stressed that the true test was whether  we\r\n\r\ngot  on  immediately with taking over of  the  Singapore Traction Company, and if we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndid not do so, he proposed to put up a motion that we\r\n\r\nshould do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the true test of socialism is not whether you\r\n\r\nare prepared to jump into a thing without looking  at\r\n\r\nit  thoroughly. There are two tests. I  think,  which\r\n\r\nmeet  the Member for Seletar's point. The first  test\r\n\r\nof  socialism  is  that you have a  determination  to\r\n\r\nsecure  a planned economy; and the second test  is  a\r\n\r\ndetermination that the plan should meet the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe   people   and  should  distribute  freedom   and\r\n\r\nresponsibility as widely as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I presume that there will still be speeches\r\n\r\nin  favour  of State capitalism, and I  think  I  had\r\n\r\nbetter  continue to outline some of  its  defects  by\r\n\r\npractical  examples. I have already told  this  House\r\n\r\nthat,  under  the Russian theory of State capitalism,\r\n\r\nthe  present-day needs of the workers were, and to  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable extent are, repudiated in the name of  a\r\n\r\nmonumental historical purpose. In theory, the workers\r\n\r\naccept and endorse this repudiation of their present-day  needs. In fact, of course, very severe  coercion\r\n\r\nis  needed  to compel the workers to accept  the  low\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living and poverty in  which  they  are\r\n\r\ncompelled to live, and I will give you a few examples\r\n\r\nof some of the decrees which, from time to time, have\r\n\r\nbeen  used. In 1929, there was a Russian State decree\r\n\r\nimposing  a minimum of three years' imprisonment  and\r\n\r\nthe  maximum  of  death by shooting  for  people  who\r\n\r\ndamaged transport installations. I am sure that  some\r\n\r\nof  the  more  excitable authoritarians of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  have welcomed the existence of such  a  decree\r\n\r\nfor  dealing with the people who damaged the Hock Lee\r\n\r\nbuses. In fact, there were people who were anxious to\r\n\r\nhave  the bullet take the place of persuasion, and  I\r\n\r\ncan  only say to the authoritarian-minded person that\r\n\r\na  good Social Democrat does not wish to fly into the\r\n\r\npowers of coercion. Those powers must exist. You  may\r\n\r\nalways come across the man who is quite unamenable to\r\n\r\nanything  except a sock on the jaw, and, if  so,  you\r\n\r\nhave to give him a sock on the jaw. But they are  not\r\n\r\nnormally  necessary and they should be  kept  in  the\r\n\r\nbackground as far as they possibly can; and we look\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforward, of course, to a society some day in which\r\n\r\nthose powers will not be used and will not be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> On a point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I  expected  he\r\n\r\nwould    appear    from    the   capitalist    party!\r\n\r\n[Interruption.] I expected that the capitalist  party\r\n\r\nwould fall into this trap! If I may look a little further ahead, I have provided\r\n\r\nfor  myself  to say that I expected that  there  were\r\n\r\nMembers  present in the House who were  not  familiar\r\n\r\nwith  this  sort of approach to industrial  relations\r\n\r\nand  who  were  not  accustomed  even  to  listen  to\r\n\r\nexpositions of theory. But I have sought  to  justify\r\n\r\nmy  exposition of theory by indicating the nature  of\r\n\r\nthe  take-over  which ought to  take  place  in  your\r\n\r\nnationalising an industry and by seeking to  indicate\r\n\r\nthe  defects  of  the  automatic take-over  of  State\r\n\r\ncapitalism,  as compared to the co-operative  type  of\r\n\r\ntake-over  of  the Social Democrat; and,  subject  to\r\n\r\nyour  stopping me, Mr Speaker, I will continue  with\r\n\r\nmy exposition of these facts, until you indicate that\r\n\r\nI have exhausted your capacity for objections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 1940 decree - I am only quoting these instances to\r\n\r\nindicate that when you take over industry under State\r\n\r\ncapitalist  methods, you do automatically  inherit  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of labour difficulties, and I think  that\r\n\r\nthat is obviously a point which must be considered if\r\n\r\nyou\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  taking over an industry - a 1940 decree in Russia:\r\n\r\ntwo to four months' imprisonment for going out for  a\r\n\r\nsmoke,  or  for  going  to the lavatory  without  the\r\n\r\nforeman's  permission; corrective labour and  25  per\r\n\r\ncent  cut  in pay for coming twenty minutes  late  to\r\n\r\nwork.  Now,  that  sort  of  thing  does  indicate  a\r\n\r\ntremendously  bad  state of labour relations  if  you\r\n\r\nhave  to  have penalties of that nature in  order  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  your  workers and keep them at  their  jobs.\r\n\r\nWell, it is a horrible state of labour relations  and\r\n\r\nthey ought not to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the collective farms Mr Mgeladze reported in the\r\n\r\nGeorgian Soviet Republic that nearly 25 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers were not completing their proper  number\r\n\r\nof   labour  days.  And  in the  Chinese   People's\r\n\r\nRepublic, the Peking People's Daily lists some of the\r\n\r\nmeans   of   conflict  employed  against  the   State\r\n\r\ncapitalist  system by workers who do  not  dare  have\r\n\r\nrecourse  to open sabotage. There again,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  workers  are  compelled to  obey  by  corrective\r\n\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I will now pass on to the practical problem\r\n\r\nbefore  us.  The  problem is to get  a  take-over  of\r\n\r\nindustry  in  which  you  will  not  have  a  head-on\r\n\r\ncollision  between the workers and the employer  who,\r\n\r\nin  this  case, will be the Government. When you  had\r\n\r\nthe  recent  Hock Lee trade dispute, it was  possible\r\n\r\nfor  Members  of  the  Government  to  intervene  and\r\n\r\nmediate. It would not be so easy for them to do so if\r\n\r\nthe  Government was, in fact, the employer.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot a matter of small importance but a matter of very\r\n\r\ngreat  importance indeed, one which  should  exercise\r\n\r\nthe  minds  of  the  House.  The  problem  of  these\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations  will occur  anywhere.  It  has\r\n\r\noccurred in the nationalised industries in the United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  and  is  occurring today in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board.  The achievement of  good  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations  is  basic and vital but it  is  not  easy.\r\n\r\nIncentive   schemes,  revisions   of   pay,   working\r\n\r\nconditions, joint consultation, do not in  themselves\r\n\r\nprovide good industrial relations, nor, of course, do\r\n\r\nthe  capitalist  and State capitalist  techniques  of\r\n\r\ncoercion, repression, corrective labour, im-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprisonment  and  shooting; it goes much  deeper  than\r\n\r\nthat.  So  I hope I have made it clear that I  reject\r\n\r\nState  capitalism as the objective in taking over  of\r\n\r\nthe  Traction Company, and I hope, without prejudging\r\n\r\nwhat  the  experts  will advise,  that  we  may  look\r\n\r\ntowards   what  Dr.  Ramanohar  Lohia,  the   Indian\r\n\r\nSocialist, has called 'immediacy'.

The point I am making, if I may go back  to\r\n\r\nthe  satisfaction of the hon. Member, is  that  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  that there may be Members here who will  wish\r\n\r\nto  jump  into  what they will call 'nationalisation'\r\n\r\nwithout   sufficient  thought  and   without   proper\r\n\r\nplanning, and I am trying to argue that that would be\r\n\r\na most dangerous thing to do and that a Commission is\r\n\r\nnecessary to advise us before we go too fast into the\r\n\r\nmatter of taking over transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I will pass on, if I may, to a point which\r\n\r\nwas  made  by  the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate on the Governor's Address, when he was dealing\r\n\r\nwith  this question of nationalised industry;  and  I\r\n\r\nmay say that, far apart as their political views are,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanglin made a point of rising to say\r\n\r\nthat  he  fully agreed and endorsed the matter  which\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Tanjong Pagar had put  forward.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong  Pagar  directed  our  attention\r\n\r\nprimarily  to  the  profits which might  be  made - the\r\n\r\npotential  profits  which might be  made-out  of  the\r\n\r\ntransport system if it was taken over by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment.   He   pointed  out   that   nationalised\r\n\r\ntransport   everywhere  else  in  the   world - so   he\r\n\r\nsaid - made profits and we could make big profits  here\r\n\r\ntoo. I was rather surprised at this because it seemed\r\n\r\nto me to show much less than his usual clear thinking\r\n\r\nand  careful study of the matter under consideration.\r\n\r\nI  should like to say most definitely that the aim is\r\n\r\nnot  to  establish a monopoly to exploit the  workers\r\n\r\nand  to  exploit the public. This is by no means  our\r\n\r\nintention, and I hope that you will take note  of  it\r\n\r\nand,  if  you have ever at any time thought  that  it\r\n\r\nwas,  that  you will duly repent. The aim is  to  end\r\n\r\nexploitation and to produce an efficient  service  to\r\n\r\nthe  public, and I very clearly said so  when  I  was\r\n\r\nreplying  to  the Address. If we can end exploitation\r\n\r\nand produce an efficient service, then the public and\r\n\r\nthe  whole  economy will benefit,  and  that  is  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  which you seek from nationalisation.  It  is\r\n\r\nperfectly  true, probably, and I expect Members  will\r\n\r\nagree,  that there is no reason, as far as I can  see\r\n\r\nat present, why publicly-owned transport in Singapore\r\n\r\nshould   not   be,   in  fact,  a   sound,   economic\r\n\r\nproposition. It should be able to pay for itself.  It\r\n\r\nshould  be  able to accumulate capital  for  its  own\r\n\r\ndevelopment   and   expansion   and   extension   and\r\n\r\nimprovement,  and  it  may even  be  possible  for  a\r\n\r\nTransport  Authority without exploitation to  make  a\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  general revenue.  But  the  revenue\r\n\r\nderived  by  Government from  it  is  not  the  first\r\n\r\nconsideration; it is very far from being so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to give my most emphatic assurance again\r\n\r\nthat   there   is   no  intention  to   exploit   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's dominance of the transport situation and\r\n\r\nthere  is no intention of repudiating the present-day\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the  workers  for a monumental  historical\r\n\r\npurpose. So much for the Government attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out that it is not enough for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to have the correct attitude. The  correct\r\n\r\nattitude   must   permeate  the  whole   nationalised\r\n\r\nindustry,  and  that  is the point  why  you  need  a\r\n\r\nCommission, because these matters of labour relations\r\n\r\nare  very, very badly understood in Singapore.  There\r\n\r\nwould not be half the strife that there is if there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  good  labour  relations on a proper  scientific\r\n\r\nbasis.  A lot of ignorant people and excitable people\r\n\r\ninvolve themselves on the managerial side and on  the\r\n\r\nworkers' side, and muddle the situation up in a quite\r\n\r\nunnecessary  way. I am not saying that everything  is\r\n\r\nwell  with  the  workers  or  with  management;   the\r\n\r\nindustries are not necessarily perfectly run.  But  I\r\n\r\ndo  say  that  the  methods  of  joint  consultation,\r\n\r\nmethods  of  industrial  democracy,  which  ought  to\r\n\r\nexist, are by no means fully developed and until they\r\n\r\nhave  been  developed, you will not get  satisfactory\r\n\r\nlabour relations; and I therefore hope that we  shall\r\n\r\nbe able to get from this Commission some guidance and\r\n\r\nleadership on the matter of how the labour  relations\r\n\r\nproblem  should  be  envisaged in  dealing  with  the\r\n\r\nnationalisation of passenger transport.  It  involves\r\n\r\nmatters  of  training,  selection,  promotion,  joint\r\n\r\nconsultation,  all  kinds of  organisational  matters\r\n\r\nwhich are highly technical and which I will not weary\r\n\r\nthis  House by attempting to expound. If anybody asks\r\n\r\nme  to,  I will be very happy to say something  about\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is in the United Kingdom the London\r\n\r\nPassenger  Transport Board. It is one of the  largest\r\n\r\nindustries  in that country and employs some  hundred\r\n\r\nthousand   persons.  It  has  been   under   national\r\n\r\nownership  for  nearly a generation, and  it  has  an\r\n\r\nexcellent  record  both for technical  efficiency  in\r\n\r\nproviding transport services, and for efficiency  and\r\n\r\nhappiness and harmony in its labour relations. We are\r\n\r\nhoping  to  get, as our expert, somebody  who  has  a\r\n\r\nthorough  knowledge  of  the working  of  the  London\r\n\r\nPassenger  Transport Board, and  of  other  transport\r\n\r\norganisations,  who  will be able  to  bring  to  our\r\n\r\nproblems here the expert knowledge derived from  long\r\n\r\nexperience elsewhere. I hope that I shall be able  to\r\n\r\nmake an announcement about that shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I will pass on to a matter I will deal with much\r\n\r\nmore briefly, because it is almost purely a technical\r\n\r\nmatter.  I have in my office a very nice map  showing\r\n\r\nthe  present transport system of Singapore Island - the\r\n\r\npassenger transport system on the roads. I thought of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbringing it into this Chamber and displaying it,  but\r\n\r\nI thought it would only cause alarm and confusion. If\r\n\r\nany Member would like to see it sometime, either call\r\n\r\nat my office or I will bring it across to this House.\r\n\r\nAll  you  can say about it is that it is not easy  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  how it arose or why it should  exist.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  there  has  been  a long  outcry  against  the\r\n\r\npresent system of passenger transport in this country\r\n\r\nby  the  public and by the workers, and  there  is  a\r\n\r\nmassive problem before us to bring order out of  this\r\n\r\nstate  of  confusion. This is a technical  matter  in\r\n\r\nwhich  we must not seek to prejudge the advice  which\r\n\r\nthe Commission will give; it is a matter which should\r\n\r\nbe  considered  by  an impartial expert  and  not  be\r\n\r\nbedevilled  by the various interests that do  operate\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say this, however, about the\r\n\r\ntransport  services - that in the  rural  areas,  there\r\n\r\ndoes seem to me a very real need for an expansion  of\r\n\r\ntransport  services, and I am sure that many  Members\r\n\r\nin  this House will agree with me. If you extend  the\r\n\r\nmap that I have - it does not cover the whole island - it\r\n\r\nshows the core of the problem, but, of course, as you\r\n\r\nextend  outwards, you get a thin line leading off  to\r\n\r\nJohore and a thin line leading off to Changi, and  so\r\n\r\non,  and  then great masses of the country  have,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  no  transport services at all. They  have  not\r\n\r\neven  got  roads. All they have got are  tracks,  and\r\n\r\npretty  bad  tracks at that, and  I  hope  that  this\r\n\r\nCommission  will  be  able to take  account  of  that\r\n\r\nproblem,  and  that we shall be able to do  something\r\n\r\nfor the rural areas as part of the general problem of\r\n\r\ngetting  the public transport system of this  country\r\n\r\nboth   into   a  rationalised  state   and   into   a\r\n\r\nnationalised state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I must, I suppose, deal briefly with the\r\n\r\nfinancial aspects of the takeover. I shall move  with\r\n\r\nthe  greatest caution in the jungle of case law which\r\n\r\nis  applicable  to such matters and  which  confronts\r\n\r\nyou, because, as soon as you pick up one word of  the\r\n\r\nthing,  you  find  that  it  has  a  long  string  of\r\n\r\ninterpretations behind it which goes back to sometime\r\n\r\nin the previous century or, possibly, to Magna Carta.\r\n\r\nI think I had better\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperhaps read to hon. Members Section 29, because  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers do not seem to have read it, and  possibly\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  are not familiar with  precisely  what\r\n\r\nthis   matter  of  the  take-over  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction  Company  is.  This is  Section  29  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Traction Ordinance:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Commissioners may within six months after the\r\n\r\nfifth  day  of June, 1955 or within six months  after\r\n\r\nthe  expiration  of any subsequent  period  of  seven\r\n\r\nyears or within three months after the making of  any\r\n\r\nOrder by the Governor in Council under either of  the\r\n\r\ntwo  immediately  preceding  sections  by  notice  in\r\n\r\nwriting  to the Company require the Company  to  sell\r\n\r\nand   thereupon  the  Company  shall  sell   to   the\r\n\r\nCommissioners  (that  is the City  Council  now)  the\r\n\r\nwhole   Undertaking,   land,  buildings,   generating\r\n\r\nstations,  substations, car sheds, works,  materials,\r\n\r\nstores, rolling-stock and plant of the Company  as  a\r\n\r\ngoing  concern.  The  total price  failing  agreement\r\n\r\nshall  be  fixed by arbitration, and in  arriving  at\r\n\r\nsuch total price the Arbitrator shall have regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  fair market value of the Undertaking, as a going\r\n\r\nconcern,  but  without any allowance being  made  for\r\n\r\ncompulsory purchase.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. and learned Members of the House may wish to\r\n\r\nput  their minds to work on what interpretation could\r\n\r\nbe  put on that Section when you are trying to fix  a\r\n\r\nprice  for  the  take-over of the Singapore  Traction\r\n\r\nCompany,  or  when you are taking over.  Or,  if  you\r\n\r\ncannot  take  it  over  by  an  agreed  price,   what\r\n\r\ninterpretation  an arbitrator would  put  if  he  was\r\n\r\ntrying  to  decide  what the  price  should  be?  The\r\n\r\nphrases  \"the  whole Undertaking\"  and  \"as  a  going\r\n\r\nconcern\"  are  not  as  simple phrases  as  they  may\r\n\r\nappear,  and  I  am sure that the lawyers  will  find\r\n\r\nplenty of employment in deciding what they mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I might also, in regard to the financial\r\n\r\naspects,  quote from a Press cutting from  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange  Gazette.

On the basis of this Report, the  shares\r\n\r\nlooked   a   most  attractive  proposition   at   the\r\n\r\nprevailing  price  of around 26  shillings,  and  the\r\n\r\nquotation, in fact, soon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimproved   to  well  over  30  shillings.

Members  know about, if I can  find  it  in  my\r\n\r\njumble  of papers. It is about the Singapore Traction\r\n\r\nCompany  Accounts for 1954.

I leave it to hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  to  form their own opinions  about  that.

So  why  wait  and  cause  all   the\r\n\r\nuncertainty  of this unsatisfactory state  of  public\r\n\r\ntransport  that  is going on? We  all  know  that  no\r\n\r\npublic  company can run efficiently  if  it  has  the\r\n\r\nSword  of  Damocles  hanging  over  it,  a  cloud  of\r\n\r\nacquisition  in a very, very short time.  This  cloud\r\n\r\nhas  been hanging over the Singapore Traction Company\r\n\r\nfor  many  years,  as a result of which  I  am  quite\r\n\r\ncertain  as much money as possible has been paid  out\r\n\r\nin  dividends  or  in  other ways  instead  of  being\r\n\r\nploughed  back into the Company. That is one  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  why  I think the buses here are  now  by  no\r\n\r\nmeans  a great credit to our City. We do not see  the\r\n\r\nlatest  types of buses which are being run in  London\r\n\r\nby the Road Transport Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we want Government to do is to acquire the\r\n\r\nSingapore Traction Company, and you can take all  the\r\n\r\ntime you like to straighten out how to take over from\r\n\r\nthe  Company, and to go to arbitration for the  price\r\n\r\nthey  ask for. I admit I have not been able to  study\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance particularly well, and  I  would  have\r\n\r\nliked  an  opportunity to study Section 29 and  speak\r\n\r\nafter  the  Adjournment; but, to my mind,  all  these\r\n\r\nthings  can be worked out. There is no such thing  as\r\n\r\nno  strikes  in a Government-owned transport  system.\r\n\r\nWhen  the Labour Government in Great Britain  was  in\r\n\r\npower, there were strikes also, and strikes will have\r\n\r\nto  be  faced by the present Government if  it  takes\r\n\r\nover the Singapore Traction Company. It has got to be\r\n\r\nworked  out, either now or later on, and  why  should\r\n\r\nyou have all this uncertainty of the public having to\r\n\r\nsuffer  a  bad  transport system  which  we  have  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of Government proceeding to acquire this\r\n\r\nCompany,  it  has  now just asked for  permission  to\r\n\r\nexamine  the  transport  system  and  advise  on  its\r\n\r\ndevelopment. It appears to me that this is an attempt\r\n\r\nto build a \"red-tape\" for the Hon. the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nto  practise, using the pair of scissors given to him\r\n\r\nby  his electors. The urgency in this case is that if\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  exercise the right under Section  29  to\r\n\r\npurchase the Singapore Traction Company, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay   have  to  wait  for  seven  years  before   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  arises again, and then  you  will  still\r\n\r\nhave  the  same  prolongation of the  uncertainty  of\r\n\r\nacquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Progressive Party, on the other hand, knows its\r\n\r\nmind  and  has  filed a motion in  the  City  Council\r\n\r\nasking it to exercise its rights under the Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThat   is  our  complaint  today:  that  the   Labour\r\n\r\nGovernment,  instead  of governing  the  country,  is\r\n\r\nspending  its  time  trying to  form  committees  and\r\n\r\ncommissions.  Apart  from the Powers  and  Privileges\r\n\r\nBill,  there  are only three matters of substance  in\r\n\r\ntoday's  agenda -  in two, Government  is  asking  for\r\n\r\ncommittees  to  be formed, and in  the  third  for  a\r\n\r\ncommission. We want Government to govern us and carry\r\n\r\nout  its  duties.  Do  not be afraid  to  do  things.\r\n\r\nAcquire first, and then iron everything out later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very\r\n\r\nunhappy  when I have to agree with any of the remarks\r\n\r\nmade  by some Members on my side of the House because\r\n\r\nthey often agree for very different reasons but I  am\r\n\r\npleased  to say today that the Member for Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lim Koon Teck) has given a reason which I think\r\n\r\nis  fairly  sound and fairly reasonable.  The  Labour\r\n\r\nFront should make up its mind what it is going to  do\r\n\r\nabout  the  Singapore Traction Company. It  came  out\r\n\r\nwith  clear  and concise statements on  its  election\r\n\r\nplatform. If it was thought necessary that we  should\r\n\r\ndo   research   on   social   democracy,   industrial\r\n\r\nrelations,   the  United  States  or  the   Socialist\r\n\r\nRepublic  of Russia, all the rest of it, that  should\r\n\r\nhave  been  in  the election platform. The  long  and\r\n\r\nshort  of it is this - let us have a Commission because\r\n\r\nwe  really  do not know what to do about it.  Let  us\r\n\r\ntherefore take the ipse dixit of someone whom we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  import from the London Passenger Transport\r\n\r\nBoard  and  \"I will tell you who it is on some  other\r\n\r\nappropriate occasion when I am in an awful  situation\r\n\r\nand  then I will bring this rabbit out of the top hat\r\n\r\nand  say, 'I have got the people.'

After what I understand  was  a\r\n\r\nlengthy  recitation  on  many  other  topics  besides\r\n\r\ntransport, of which happily I was only able  to  hear\r\n\r\nthe tail end, I am quite confused now as to where  he\r\n\r\nintends  going. Is he going to take the S.T.C. buses\r\n\r\nand  settle  \"Magpie's\" doubts or is he  not?  Is  he\r\n\r\ndeterred  from  taking  over the  S.T.C. because  he\r\n\r\ncannot understand Section 29? What is the difficulty?\r\n\r\nIs  it  the  price fixing? If it is, well  the  price\r\n\r\nfixing  can  always be settled as a separate  matter.\r\n\r\nThat has nothing to do with the principle whether  or\r\n\r\nnot the Singapore Traction Company should cease to be\r\n\r\na   private  monopoly,  and  become  either  a  State\r\n\r\nmonopoly  or  a State corporation. The  latter  is  a\r\n\r\ncompletely different problem and when Members on this\r\n\r\nside of the House also say that it should be so, then\r\n\r\nI  think  the Labour Front should have confidence  in\r\n\r\ngoing  boldly forward, quite certain that there  will\r\n\r\nbe  no  sniping  at  its flanks.  What  I  am  really\r\n\r\nastounded  at is that the Member for Paya  Lebar  had\r\n\r\nreally given us, quite unintentionally I am sure, the\r\n\r\nevils  of capitalism. When a company is faced with  a\r\n\r\nsituation  which  it knew must come sooner  or  later\r\n\r\nwhen  it first started, when it must face dissolution\r\n\r\nor nationalisation, it deliberately sends out capital\r\n\r\nfrom the country, and runs buses which in his opinion\r\n\r\n(and  I  am  glad to hear that he has good  taste  in\r\n\r\nbuses)  are  a  disgrace. Therefore this  disgraceful\r\n\r\ncapitalist  should be allowed to leave  decently.  He\r\n\r\nshould have all his doubts resolved now. Let us  take\r\n\r\nthem  over  and let us pay them the compensation  for\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite sure that \"Magpie\", whoever he is,\r\n\r\ncannot  be  altogether  unaware  when  he  made   his\r\n\r\nestimate  of the worth of buying shares in a  company\r\n\r\nwhich is going to be taken over, cannot be altogether\r\n\r\nunaware  that  the then Colonial Government  cum  its\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party aides were favourably disposed  to\r\n\r\nthe  susceptibilities of employers who have  to  look\r\n\r\nfor  further  employment in some other  part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  I  do  not  understand  the  change  in   his\r\n\r\nestimation at the tail end of \"Magpie\". I should have\r\n\r\nthought that one of the reasons why the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  for  Paya  Lebar is anxious  that  we  should\r\n\r\nresolve  the  doubts of those who own  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction Company is that it is quite likely  that  if\r\n\r\nthe  matter  persists long enough the  situation  may\r\n\r\nwell  reach  that  point where,  after  an  intensive\r\n\r\ncourse   of   lectures   on  socialism,   capitalism,\r\n\r\nCommunism and the differences between them all,  that\r\n\r\nTransport Company will find that its balance sheet is\r\n\r\nno  longer the test of the worth of the Company.  The\r\n\r\nstocks and shares in the Stock Exchange may take very\r\n\r\nrapid  turns long before the take-over.  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould not be unduly constrained by the thought  that\r\n\r\nif  we  miss  this opportunity we shall not  have  it\r\n\r\nagain for seven years. Laws are made to be unmade and\r\n\r\nto  be  remade.  The  Hon. the Attorney  General  has\r\n\r\npassed one this morning with the greatest of ease.  I\r\n\r\nthink we should not have the slightest difficulty  in\r\n\r\namending  Section 29. Let it never be forgotten  that\r\n\r\nthis  House  cannot bind itself. No  government  can.\r\n\r\nCertainly I do not believe that any government should\r\n\r\nbind  itself  on  the  question of  public  passenger\r\n\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are in fact two very different problems,\r\n\r\none - public  passenger transport as depicted  in  this\r\n\r\nbeautiful  map with red lines and blue lines  growing\r\n\r\nthinner  and  thinner as they depart  away  from  the\r\n\r\nCity.  Two,  the  problem of the  Singapore  Traction\r\n\r\nCompany. One is a long-term problem. The other is  an\r\n\r\nimmediate   one.  In  my  opinion  a  Commission   is\r\n\r\ncompletely irrelevant in so far as it is to help  the\r\n\r\nGovernment make up its mind on the Singapore Traction\r\n\r\nCompany. No one on this side of the House would  deny\r\n\r\nthe  Government  the assistance of  a  Commission  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  and  to explore the question  of  public\r\n\r\nownership  and public transport. Where the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction  Company is concerned, that is  a  different\r\n\r\nmatter.  We,  on this side of the House,  hope  there\r\n\r\nwill be a clear and categorical statement of policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

Let\r\n\r\nthat be clear. The Singapore Traction Company is  not\r\n\r\ngoing to be taken over at this juncture. We regret we\r\n\r\nare   not  distributing  Hari  Raya  bonuses  to   the\r\n\r\nshareholders in London or in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are accused of not running the Government, but of\r\n\r\nmerely   appointing  commissions.  We  do  not   need\r\n\r\ncommissions  to  help us make up our minds.  We  need\r\n\r\ncommissions  in  order  to  assist  us  to  put  into\r\n\r\noperation the ideas which we have in mind. We do  not\r\n\r\nknow  all  the  answers, and we are  not  ashamed  to\r\n\r\nconfess it. We have our policies and they are  clear,\r\n\r\nbut we do need assistance in putting them in force. I\r\n\r\nsee no necessity for taking over the Traction Company\r\n\r\nnow.  We will take it over in due course, but we will\r\n\r\ntake  it  over as part of a whole, not piecemeal,  to\r\n\r\nplease any individual shareholder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The policy we have adopted throughout  is\r\n\r\nto plan ahead without reference to any possible take-over.\"  That is the Chairman's firm asseveration.  He\r\n\r\nis not worried about the take-over. They are planning\r\n\r\nahead on the understanding that the take over may  or\r\n\r\nmay not come about. They quite recognise that they do\r\n\r\nnot  know what the policy might be; they do not  mind\r\n\r\nabout  it apparently in the least, and they are quite\r\n\r\nhappy to make 12 per cent dividend. If it is a matter\r\n\r\nof  whether they are ploughing their capital back you\r\n\r\ncan  argue  about  that  if you  want  to.  They  are\r\n\r\nordering  40  Guy Arab single deck bus  chassis  with\r\n\r\nGardner engines, and pre-selector gear-boxes;  and  a\r\n\r\nfurther  18 if they want them. So they are putting  a\r\n\r\ncertain amount more into action and, of course,  that\r\n\r\nall  increases the price of the take-over if  you  do\r\n\r\ntake-over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree with the argument that we should\r\n\r\nacquire  first and iron everything out afterwards.  I\r\n\r\nhave  spent a long time in trying to explain  why  it\r\n\r\nwas  a  bad  thing to do. I am afraid the Member  for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar  admitted that he had learnt very  little\r\n\r\nfrom what I had said, and I will repeat the old crack\r\n\r\nabout \"I can give you arguments but I cannot give you\r\n\r\nbrains  to  understand them.\" There is no urgency  to\r\n\r\nmake  up  our  minds right now as,  though  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil is rushing into a motion, we have right up to\r\n\r\nthe 5th December to do so. If you want to take it  up\r\n\r\nunder  Section  29  of  the Ordinance,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nparticular  hurry to take it up by  tomorrow  or  the\r\n\r\nnext  day. There is no reason why you should not have\r\n\r\nthe  Commission to give you advice in  three  months'\r\n\r\ntime  and you will still have plenty of time to write\r\n\r\na  letter  if you want to and arrange for  the  take-over.  It is not such a difficult matter as all  that\r\n\r\nto write a letter to the Traction Company if you want\r\n\r\nto; and I cannot think there is anything else much to\r\n\r\nreply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar seems, on the whole,\r\n\r\nto  agree  with me.

Local  government\r\n\r\nservice  is  the place where people learn,  and  this\r\n\r\npolitical education is very necessary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   the  whole  process  of  the  democratic  state.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  more  opportunities  people  get  of\r\n\r\ntaking part in local government, the better it  would\r\n\r\nbe for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, again, I consider that rural and urban\r\n\r\ninterests are conflicting and incompatible  and  that\r\n\r\nit  is  hardly  expected of a small City  and  Island\r\n\r\nCouncil  of 24 (32 if aldermen are included) to  hold\r\n\r\nthe balance between the urgent needs and interests of\r\n\r\nthe  urban  areas and those of the rural  areas.  The\r\n\r\nideals, ways of life and the conception of the art of\r\n\r\nliving of the urban dweller are diametrically opposed\r\n\r\nto  those  of the rural dweller. To rural inhabitants\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  living in areas  far  away  from  the\r\n\r\ncentre of activity, the City and Island Council could\r\n\r\nbecome an impersonal body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also advisable to consider whether it is\r\n\r\ndesirable  to have on this island two authorities - the\r\n\r\nLegislative   Assembly  and  the  City   and   Island\r\n\r\nCouncil - of  such  size  and powers.  The  concept  of\r\n\r\ngovernment  in Singapore, in my view,  should  be  to\r\n\r\nestablish  the  Legislative Assembly as  emphatically\r\n\r\nthe responsible body for the welfare of the island as\r\n\r\na  whole,  while  at  the same  time  bringing  local\r\n\r\ngovernment matters of suitable character much  closer\r\n\r\nto the real control and interests of the rate-payers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in consequence of the foregoing reasons,\r\n\r\nthe  whole question of reform of local government  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  should be considered afresh. To that  end,\r\n\r\nmy  motion indicates the lines on which the suggested\r\n\r\nreforms should take.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to appoint a committee to inquire\r\n\r\ninto  the  desirability of decentralising the  powers\r\n\r\nand  functions  of  the City Council  and  the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard,  and inquire into and make recommendations  on\r\n\r\nthe  desirability  of  setting up  District  Councils\r\n\r\nappropriately   named  and  responsible   for   local\r\n\r\ngovernment functions in different geographical  areas\r\n\r\nof  the island, having regard to the municipal status\r\n\r\nof  the older parts of the city area.

I am  aware  that\r\n\r\nthe   Rendel   Commission  recommended  that   public\r\n\r\nutilities like water, electricity and gas should, for\r\n\r\nthe  time being at any rate, be placed under the City\r\n\r\nand  Island Council.

As Members are  aware,\r\n\r\nI  have  been for over four years connected with  the\r\n\r\nCity Council of Singapore as an elected Councillor.

The decisions taken by a local government\r\n\r\nbody  regulate the day-to-day life of the  population\r\n\r\nand  so  much so that they become part and parcel  of\r\n\r\nthe  life  and  habits  of  the  population.  It   is\r\n\r\ntherefore  very  desirable that the local  government\r\n\r\nbody  should  be brought as close to  the  people  as\r\n\r\npossible,  and that the public in every part  of  the\r\n\r\nisland  should feel that they are closely  associated\r\n\r\nwith   and  are  themselves  responsible  for  taking\r\n\r\ndecisions  which  affect their day-to-day  life,  and\r\n\r\nparticularly   decisions  which  affect   their   own\r\n\r\nlocality.  A  system of allowing the people  in  each\r\n\r\ndistrict  to  regulate their own day-to-day  life  to\r\n\r\nsuit  their  own local conditions would be impossible\r\n\r\nwith   the  establishment  of  an  island-wide  local\r\n\r\ngovernment authority, as is recommended in the Rendel\r\n\r\nCommission's Report.

So,  instead  of\r\n\r\ncarrying on at once with what only a month ago was an\r\n\r\nurgent  measure we are to go three or four  years  in\r\n\r\nreverse to reconsider the ground covered by the  Hill\r\n\r\nReport, the recommendations of the Rendel Commission,\r\n\r\nand  all  the  committee reports and memoranda  which\r\n\r\nhave  been poured out on all these subjects.

Will  it\r\n\r\nbe  economical, will it be expeditious,  will  it  be\r\n\r\nefficient, to have numerous District Councils  dotted\r\n\r\nover the island to carry on rural administration, and\r\n\r\nwhat  will the effect be of making the City  Council,\r\n\r\nor  whatever the Central Municipal Authority will  be\r\n\r\ncalled in the future, even more powerful and more  of\r\n\r\nthe  'big brother' in its relationship with them than\r\n\r\nis  the case with the Rural Board today?

Indeed much is to be lost,\r\n\r\nbecause  as soon as these public utilities leave  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the  City  Council,  their  considerable\r\n\r\nproperties will be subject to assessment from payment\r\n\r\nof which they at present enjoy complete immunity. The\r\n\r\nobvious  result will be evident within six months  or\r\n\r\nso  of the establishment of these corporations,  that\r\n\r\nthe prices of electricity, water and gas will have to\r\n\r\nbe  increased. It has been suggested on more than one\r\n\r\noccasion  that  these  public  utilities  should   be\r\n\r\nremoved  from  political control, but  cannot  it  be\r\n\r\nfairly  argued  that in the last few  years  politics\r\n\r\nhave  seen  to it that rates have not been  increased\r\n\r\ndespite  very  heavy  capital  expenditure  on  these\r\n\r\nundertakings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards paragraph (d) - the reallocation of the\r\n\r\nfunctions and financial responsibilities between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the local authorities - I  am  informed\r\n\r\nthat   exhaustive  recommendations   were   made   to\r\n\r\nGovernment  on the whole of this question  only  last\r\n\r\nyear.  Any  further survey of this field would  be  a\r\n\r\nwaste of time and effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the subject of multi-lingualism and the\r\n\r\nprocedure   for  its  adoption,  is  the   Government\r\n\r\nseriously  implying  that it has  no  well-considered\r\n\r\nplans on how this should be carried out, despite  the\r\n\r\nfact  that it was an important plank in its platform?\r\n\r\nCan it be that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Government, having found it difficult in the last\r\n\r\nfew weeks to make any firm decision of its own in one\r\n\r\nlanguage,  now  wishes  to  pass  on  to  others  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of deciding how to conduct business in\r\n\r\nfour  or more? And indeed, Sir, is not this the  root\r\n\r\ncause  of  this extraordinary eleventh  hour  motion,\r\n\r\nnamely,  that the hon. Members opposite have not  got\r\n\r\nthe  courage of their own convictions? I say to them,\r\n\r\n\"Get  on  and  govern.\"  If you  are  convinced  that\r\n\r\nDistrict  Councils and electricity  corporations  and\r\n\r\ndecentralisation   are  the  best   form   of   local\r\n\r\ngovernment,  then  it  is  your  job  to  draft   the\r\n\r\nnecessary legislation and bring it before this  House\r\n\r\nand  use your majority to get it passed. But  do  not\r\n\r\nexpect  us to do the work for you, so that later  you\r\n\r\nmay  get  all the credit for work that goes on  well,\r\n\r\nand pass on the blame to this side of the House if it\r\n\r\ndoes not. We have the remarkable position whereby the\r\n\r\nGovernment is trying to have the best of both worlds.\r\n\r\nPolicies  are  to  be worked out in committees  by  a\r\n\r\ncoalition of Parties, and executive action then taken\r\n\r\nby the Government Party alone. This is not the way in\r\n\r\nwhich  democratic institutions operate. This  is  not\r\n\r\nthe way in which party government operates. We reject\r\n\r\nthis  policy  of 'passing the buck' and  of  avoiding\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and  shirking  unpopularity,  and  we\r\n\r\noppose  this  motion. Let the hon.  Members  opposite\r\n\r\nmake  their  own  decisions and stand  by  them,  and\r\n\r\ngovern  as  a  popularly elected majority  government\r\n\r\nshould govern. And let them realise that there  is  a\r\n\r\ngrowing  body of public opinion from every  community\r\n\r\nand class throughout the country which considers that\r\n\r\ntheir  actions show that they have been in power  for\r\n\r\nseven weeks too long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must also\r\n\r\nregret  the  somewhat  hasty  about-turn  that   this\r\n\r\nGovernment  has found necessary in a  matter  of  two\r\n\r\nmonths. It is not a matter which should have been  so\r\n\r\nlightly  reversed. When they drafted the  Address  by\r\n\r\nHis  Excellency the Governor, the Government had then\r\n\r\ntaken  stock  of the position and had  at  that  time\r\n\r\ndecided to go on with the City and Island Council\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill.  We  must have more explanation why it  is  now\r\n\r\nthought  necessary  that this whole  Bill  is  to  be\r\n\r\nscrapped and a commission instituted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sympathise with them in viewing the City and\r\n\r\nIsland  Council provisions with a degree of suspicion\r\n\r\nand  of unhappiness. That was, with the exception  of\r\n\r\nthe present Minister for Labour (Mr Lim Yew Hock), a\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party  concept. It  had  its  attractive\r\n\r\nqualities. It was neat; it was simple. You  drop  out\r\n\r\nthe  25th  constituency, and you have 24  nice,  neat\r\n\r\nconstituencies for your City and Island Council.  You\r\n\r\nhave  the  same  machinery  for  elections  and   you\r\n\r\ntransfer half, or more than half the functions  of  a\r\n\r\nlittle   government  like  that  of  the  Colony   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, to another semi-government body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a lot to be said - and I think it should\r\n\r\nbe said much more fully before this debate closes - for\r\n\r\nreviewing  it  from  this point  of  view:  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment feels that a more democratic framework can\r\n\r\nbe  set up to associate more and more people with the\r\n\r\ngoverning and regulating of their own lives;  and  if\r\n\r\nRural  District Councils is one method of  doing  it,\r\n\r\nthen Rural District Councils should be created. But I\r\n\r\nthink this matter has been viewed too lightly. It  is\r\n\r\nnot a matter that can be resolved just by a committee\r\n\r\nor  a  commission, either of this House alone  or  to\r\n\r\ninclude  outsiders. Before this motion is passed,  we\r\n\r\nwould like to have the Government state categorically\r\n\r\nwhy  it was that, within these eight weeks, they have\r\n\r\ndecided that there were cogent and strong reasons  to\r\n\r\nabandon  the  City and Island Council  Bill,  and  we\r\n\r\nwould wish to hear it now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

We had been always fighting to have co-ordination in this small island of Singapore between\r\n\r\nthe City Council, the Improvement Trust and the Rural\r\n\r\nBoard. In the post-war period we had the Hill Report.\r\n\r\nThen we had the recommendations by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRendel Commission.

But\r\n\r\nthe request for an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexplanation from the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  is  a\r\n\r\nlegitimate  one, as I have said, and  the  answer  is\r\n\r\nthis:  We were appointed as a Government on  the  7th\r\n\r\nApril.  In,  I  think, seventeen days we  had  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  a  great deal in order to acquaint ourselves\r\n\r\nwith  our  Ministries,  work  out  a  new  tradition,\r\n\r\norganise  ourselves  as a team, because  it  must  be\r\n\r\nremembered that it is not the Labour Front alone that\r\n\r\nis  the  Government, nor the coalition  that  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment -  as my learned Friend keeps on  insisting\r\n\r\nand  rubbing in to some extent truthfully - and we  had\r\n\r\nto  learn to work as a team, and it was then that  we\r\n\r\nunderstood that there was the City and Island Council\r\n\r\nBill  ready on the stocks which required but a little\r\n\r\namendment for the purpose of adding the multi-lingual\r\n\r\nsections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when it came to consider other matters that may\r\n\r\nbe  cognate  to the multi-lingual sections,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to reserve my position on what I had hoped would\r\n\r\nbe a pleasant surprise-and which I hope still will be\r\n\r\na  pleasant surprise - in matters in relation  to  the\r\n\r\nBills   that   would  be  introduced  ultimately   in\r\n\r\nconnection with the City and Island Council.  But  it\r\n\r\nwas   then  discovered  that  we  were  creating  and\r\n\r\nperpetuating  and strengthening, in a  small  island,\r\n\r\ntwo     bodies - the    Assembly    and    the     City\r\n\r\nCouncil - independent almost of each other,  with  very\r\n\r\nconsiderable  powers,  and  that  the  City  Council,\r\n\r\nthough  allegedly parochial in character, would  have\r\n\r\nsuch  considerable authority that it could flout  the\r\n\r\ndecisions and impede the execution of the policies of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly. That is a dangerous position in a small\r\n\r\nisland, and we see, to some extent, how it is working\r\n\r\ntoday  when hon. Members representing the Progressive\r\n\r\nParty  talked blithely - may I say, to my mind, with  a\r\n\r\ncertain  sense of irresponsibility - about a motion  in\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council to purchase the Traction  Company,\r\n\r\nwithout seeking to co-ordinate their action with  the\r\n\r\naction  of the Government; without seeking to  inform\r\n\r\nthemselves  as to our views when, having issued  that\r\n\r\nnotice to purchase, they come along to us and ask  us\r\n\r\nfor money, and find they cannot have it! When City\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncillors   can   descend   to   the   status    of\r\n\r\nirresponsible  little children,  as  has  been  amply\r\n\r\nproved here today by the words of the Members of  the\r\n\r\nProgressive Party, you can appreciate how very really\r\n\r\ndangerous  the position would be if the City  Council\r\n\r\nwere  given  powers independent of the Assembly,  and\r\n\r\nauthority which could flout our decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we have been attacked for having\r\n\r\ncommissions. One would imagine we had invented  them.\r\n\r\nI,  for  one,  would not be ashamed to have  invented\r\n\r\ncommissions.  But having come to the conclusion  that\r\n\r\nit  was  dangerous to have this island-wide authority\r\n\r\njuxtaposed to this very Assembly, we then went to the\r\n\r\nRendel Commission which gave it birth, and from there\r\n\r\nto  the Hill Commission, and from there to certain of\r\n\r\nour own local experts. The problems are vast ones and\r\n\r\na  commission  can be very helpful,  not  seeking  to\r\n\r\navoid  our  responsibility, as has been so sneeringly\r\n\r\nsuggested,  but  seeking  for  the  welfare  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry  that  all should be given an opportunity  to\r\n\r\nco-operate.  We  have never sought to  make  political\r\n\r\ncapital - that  we leave to the Party  that  makes  the\r\n\r\ncharge - and  I  would like to add this:  that  if  the\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party  and the party representing  Telok\r\n\r\nAyer  do not wish to take part in assisting in  these\r\n\r\ndeliberations for the formulation of a policy,  of  a\r\n\r\nprocedure  for  the  parochial  government  of   this\r\n\r\nisland, they would be very welcome to abstain - we hope\r\n\r\nthey  will have the courage to abstain - or disown  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  who  has spoken so  sneeringly  of  the\r\n\r\ncommission. That is the explanation of the Government\r\n\r\nfor  what  is  called the volte-face.

As the House is probably aware, when  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  was set up in 1949, the King  Edward  VII\r\n\r\nCollege  of  Medicine - then a  Government  department - ceased  to  exist  and  was  incorporated  into   the\r\n\r\nUniversity.  That  meant  that  the  then  Government\r\n\r\nservants  who  formed the staff of the  College  were\r\n\r\ngiven  the option of remaining in Government  service\r\n\r\nor  joining  the University; and it was necessary  at\r\n\r\nthat time to safeguard the right to pension and other\r\n\r\nsuperannuation benefits which those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficers  had. This was done by some Rules  known  as\r\n\r\nthe  University of Malaya (Staff Transfer) Rules, and\r\n\r\nthey  were duly passed and formally ratified. One  of\r\n\r\nthe provisions of those Rules was that an officer who\r\n\r\nhad been pensionable in the Government service should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be eligible for his Government  pension\r\n\r\nand for an additional pension for the period in which\r\n\r\nhe  was  serving  at the University  of  Malaya.  The\r\n\r\nUniversity, which does not itself pay pensions,  will\r\n\r\nrepay  to  the Government the cost of the  additional\r\n\r\npensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, so good; but a number of difficulties were\r\n\r\nthen  discovered. One was that those  Rules  provided\r\n\r\nthat  the pension should be calculated on the  salary\r\n\r\nthe  officer  could reasonably have been expected  to\r\n\r\ndraw had he remained in the Government service. That,\r\n\r\nwe  have agreed, was not equitable, because it  meant\r\n\r\nthat,  in  fact, an officer who joined the University\r\n\r\nand  subsequently obtained promotion, and thereby got\r\n\r\na very much higher salary, could not have his pension\r\n\r\ncalculated on that higher salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difficulty was that these posts no longer\r\n\r\nexist in Government service, so it is really going to\r\n\r\nbe  difficult in ten or fifteen years'  time  to  say\r\n\r\nwhat salary the Government would have paid to a tutor\r\n\r\nor  a  lecturer  if  the  Government  had  then  been\r\n\r\nemploying  tutors or lecturers, which it is  not,  in\r\n\r\nfact, doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another difficulty arose out of the\r\n\r\napportionment between the Government of Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe  Government of the Federation and the  University\r\n\r\nof the financial liabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the upshot of all these difficulties, and some\r\n\r\nrather  prolonged discussions, has been that we  have\r\n\r\nfound  a  solution  which has been accepted  by  this\r\n\r\nGovernment, by the Government of the Federation,  and\r\n\r\nby  the  University, and is also  acceptable  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  concerned.  That solution  can  be  described\r\n\r\nquite  simply:  it  is  that we  should  tackle  this\r\n\r\nproblem  in  the  same way as a  similar  problem  is\r\n\r\ntackled  between different governments. We have  what\r\n\r\nare known as the Colonial Mixed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nService  Pension Rules, and they provide for  exactly\r\n\r\nthis  sort  of  difficulties  where  an  officer  has\r\n\r\nservice with more than one government; for example, a\r\n\r\nman may serve in the Federation, or in Singapore, and\r\n\r\nthen  come  back  to  Singapore,  and  he  has  mixed\r\n\r\nservice. Those rules provide a satisfactory solution.\r\n\r\nWithout going into technicalities, they provide  that\r\n\r\nwhen  the  officer retires, his pension is calculated\r\n\r\non his then salary, and it is apportioned between the\r\n\r\nvarious   authorities   who   have   undertaken   the\r\n\r\nliability.  This  proposal has been accepted  by  all\r\n\r\nparties   concerned,  and  it  has   been   effected,\r\n\r\nauthorised,  by the Rules, to which I  have  referred\r\n\r\nwhich  were  laid in Sessional Paper No.  S.L.  1  of\r\n\r\n1955. And I now seek this Assembly's approval of that\r\n\r\nRule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to add one further point, Sir, and\r\n\r\nthat is I am not quite clear in my own mind, Sir,  as\r\n\r\nto whether it could be held that the Rule of which  I\r\n\r\nam   seeking  approval  commits  the  Government   to\r\n\r\nadditional  expenditure. It will, in fact,  have  the\r\n\r\neffect  of making some light increase in the  pension\r\n\r\nbill -  it  is  extremely difficult  to  estimate  it,\r\n\r\nbecause it depends on the age to which officers  live\r\n\r\nand  the  salaries they draw, and how long they  live\r\n\r\ndrawing  their pensions. But, peradventure, Sir,  you\r\n\r\nshould  have any doubt as to whether, under  Standing\r\n\r\nOrder  No.  33  (2), this does involve a  commitment,\r\n\r\nwithout  prejudice to your ruling  on  that,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to state that I have the consent  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernor to move this motion. I therefore move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M.

M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the Governor's authority to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the Government\r\n\r\nshould  be empowered to authorise expenditure on  new\r\n\r\nservices  up to a limit of $10,000 in each case,  and\r\n\r\nrevotes  of provision approved in the previous  year,\r\n\r\npending the covering approval of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Sir, in connection with new services:\r\n\r\nDuring  the  course  of  the year,  the  Treasury  is\r\n\r\npresented with numerous requests for small  sums  for\r\n\r\nservices  arising out of the day-to-day routine  work\r\n\r\nof  government. These services refer to such  mundane\r\n\r\nmatters   as   the  purchase  of  office   equipment,\r\n\r\naccounting machinery, unexpected repairs to vehicles,\r\n\r\nthe  purchase of new vehicles to replace those  which\r\n\r\nhave  become  unserviceable, donations to  charitable\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  supplements to annual recurrent  votes\r\n\r\nsuch   as  for  telephones,  light,  fuel,  municipal\r\n\r\nservices. The requests involve no principle which  is\r\n\r\nnovel  or  which  is  likely to be  contentious.  The\r\n\r\nrequests  are complete in themselves and  involve  no\r\n\r\ncontinuing  or contingent liability. The amounts  are\r\n\r\nsmall - $l0,000 would cover the largest of them, and  a\r\n\r\ngreat  majority would be considerably less. I  cannot\r\n\r\nsay  that  any of these items are of extreme urgency.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, they are all important. It will be\r\n\r\nconvenient, and the machinery of government will  run\r\n\r\nmore  smoothly,  if  they can be  approved  forthwith\r\n\r\npending the approval of the Assembly, and if they  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  to wait until the submission of  the  next\r\n\r\nschedule  of applications for supplementary votes  to\r\n\r\nthe Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, in connection with revotes: It\r\n\r\nsometimes happens that capital projects such  as  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of a school, a bridge or a road,  which  it\r\n\r\nwas  hoped to complete within one year, cannot be  so\r\n\r\ncompleted. Financial provision for the project lapses\r\n\r\nat  the end of the financial year, but the work  must\r\n\r\ncontinue if loss and harm to the project is not to be\r\n\r\nsuffered.  Similarly, sometimes goods  and  equipment\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nordered  for  delivery within a year,  and  for  some\r\n\r\nreason   or   other  delivery  cannot  be   obtained.\r\n\r\nFinancial  provision lapses and delivery takes  place\r\n\r\nperhaps  very  early in the new year. It  is  clearly\r\n\r\nnecessary  in such cases that the unexpended  portion\r\n\r\nof  the  vote  should be immediately available.  Work\r\n\r\ngoes  on. Wages must be paid. Cost of materials  must\r\n\r\nbe   met.  Payment  must  be  made  when  goods   are\r\n\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said it was clearly desirable that the\r\n\r\nunexpended portion of the provisions for the services\r\n\r\nshould  be  immediately available, and  hon.  Members\r\n\r\nwill  appreciate that considerable difficulties might\r\n\r\narise  if  we  had to await the next sitting  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly   for  approval  to  incur  expenditure.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore   seek  authority  to  approve   unforeseen\r\n\r\nrevotes as and when the need arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection hon. Members will bear in mind\r\n\r\nthat  the projects to which these revotes relate have\r\n\r\nbeen  considered by the Legislature in  the  previous\r\n\r\nyear  and funds have been voted. No new principle  is\r\n\r\ninvolved; no new money is required. I would also  say\r\n\r\nthat  if  this  power is approved, it  will  only  be\r\n\r\nexercised  in  connection with work  which  has  been\r\n\r\nstarted,  or  in  respect of goods  which  have  been\r\n\r\nordered,  and  will  not of course  be  exercised  in\r\n\r\nconnection with work which, for some reason, has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  started or in respect of goods which  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would say that if this delegation\r\n\r\nof  authority is approved, the items for new services\r\n\r\nand  revotes  which are approved under the  delegated\r\n\r\nauthority  will be included in schedules which  will\r\n\r\nbe presented to the Assembly for covering approval at\r\n\r\nthe earliest convenient opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

This is not to say that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will not exercise and conduct  itself  in\r\n\r\nsuch a manner as to be almost beyond reproach, but if\r\n\r\nthe  House  of Commons in Britain does  not  find  it\r\n\r\nnecessary to have this practice of the revote,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  see  why, however cogent, however convenient  it\r\n\r\nmay be, we should have this system in Singapore. This\r\n\r\nis  a  carry-over of the old colonial system where  a\r\n\r\nsmall Legislative Assembly would resolve itself  into\r\n\r\na Committee of Estimates; where a small group of four\r\n\r\nor five unofficials sit on the Finance Committee, and\r\n\r\nwhere  things are done conveniently as  part  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonial machinery. We are leaving behind that  past,\r\n\r\nand  we  like to have this first right - on our way  to\r\n\r\nbecoming a House of the People, of representatives of\r\n\r\nthe  people - to  have  a say in every  expenditure  of\r\n\r\npublic funds. If a project\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  in  operation and cannot be completed before  the\r\n\r\nfinancial year runs out, then it is the duty  of  the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretariat  and the  Hon. the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  see  that the matter  is  put  in  the\r\n\r\npresent year's Estimates, in time for that project to\r\n\r\ngo   on.  A  procedure  whereby  the  Government  can\r\n\r\ncontinue with something it started last year on funds\r\n\r\nwhich  were voted last year, in conditions which  may\r\n\r\nhave  radically altered, and in which the people  and\r\n\r\nits  representatives may feel it necessary no  longer\r\n\r\nto continue expending that money, is not one which  I\r\n\r\nthink should be continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would like to second it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That the words `and revotes of\r\n\r\nprovision  approved in the previous year pending  the\r\n\r\ncovering  approval of this Assembly' proposed  to  be\r\n\r\nleft out, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I am not an expert on the\r\n\r\nconstitutional procedure in the House of  Commons  in\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom  but I suspect  that  work  must\r\n\r\ncontinue  over from one financial year to another  in\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom, and I also suspect, subject  to\r\n\r\ncorrection,  that  provision is made  in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  for revotes.

Perhaps  it  was\r\n\r\nintended  that  it  should be started  in  March  and\r\n\r\nfinished by November. If started in July and  it  has\r\n\r\nto  continue on till the next year it would be  folly\r\n\r\nto  leave that school without a roof until such  time\r\n\r\nas the Assembly met again and would approve funds for\r\n\r\nthe project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very careful to point out, Sir, when I asked\r\n\r\nfor  this power, that it should be exercised with the\r\n\r\ngreatest  discretion,  that  no  new  principle   was\r\n\r\ninvolved,  that  no  new  money  was  involved.

The matter which I  wish  to  raise\r\n\r\nbefore  this House is one of considerable  importance\r\n\r\nnot  only  to  this Assembly, but to  the  people  at\r\n\r\nlarge.  There  are approximately not  more  than  one\r\n\r\nhundred   people  at  any  one  time   watching   the\r\n\r\nproceedings of this Assembly, and it is a  matter  of\r\n\r\nvital  importance that a fair, impartial and unbiased\r\n\r\naccount of the proceedings of this Assembly should be\r\n\r\ngiven  by  agencies which are within the  control  of\r\n\r\nthis  Government.  Neither the  Government  nor  this\r\n\r\nAssembly have any right to dictate how our newspapers\r\n\r\nare to give their accounts of the proceedings in this\r\n\r\nHouse.  But  we  take  strenuous  objection  when   a\r\n\r\nGovernment agency like Radio Malaya, both in its news\r\n\r\nbulletins  and in its monthly accounts of proceedings\r\n\r\nin  the  Assembly, gives an account which leaves  the\r\n\r\nlistener  with  an  impression  which  is  completely\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  that which a person sitting  in  the\r\n\r\nStrangers' Gallery would obtain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that either the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nor the Chief Secretary has in any way been personally\r\n\r\nresponsible for these reports. I would say that it is\r\n\r\npart    of   the   legacy   of   a   colonial   past.\r\n\r\n[Interruption.]    We   should    not    have    such\r\n\r\nunparliamentary language from a person  who  occupies\r\n\r\nso  high  an  office  in  this  country  and  in  the\r\n\r\nhierarchy  of the colonial system. He should  conduct\r\n\r\nhimself  with more propriety and decorum.  He  should\r\n\r\nremember   that   even  if  he  is   not   personally\r\n\r\nresponsible for these reports, he should not, as  the\r\n\r\nMember  responsible for that branch, allow an agency,\r\n\r\nwhich  in more democratic countries in the world  are\r\n\r\nfair  and impartial corporations, to be an instrument\r\n\r\nof government propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to go too far back into the past,\r\n\r\nbut  I  think  whoever listened to the 1.30  news  of\r\n\r\nRadio  Malaya after the emergency meeting last Monday\r\n\r\nwould  have  believed that the House was filled  with\r\n\r\nnothing  but a roaring peroration from the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief   Minister  reading  out  his  lurid   account,\r\n\r\nunchallenged,  of what took place. [Interruption.]  I\r\n\r\nbeg  the  Chief Minister's pardon, but one  finds  it\r\n\r\ndifficult to overcome the habits of a colonial  past.\r\n\r\nIt  is not the Chief Minister. When one thinks of the\r\n\r\nperson in authority one always thinks of the colonial\r\n\r\nofficial  as that person, the person who directs  the\r\n\r\ncourse   of   affairs.  The  Chief  Secretary   spoke\r\n\r\napproximately for some seventy minutes in this House.\r\n\r\nI  could  not believe that report over Radio  Malaya,\r\n\r\nand  I  therefore  went back to  check  my  facts.  I\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that I spoke approximately  five  minutes\r\n\r\nless   than  the  Chief  Secretary,  and  the   Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary's  tirade received almost ten minutes  over\r\n\r\nRadio  Malaya's  1.30 p.m. news, and the  Opposition,\r\n\r\nthe  answer  to his speech, was dismissed in  fifteen\r\n\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if the English Press, or the Chinese\r\n\r\nPress, or the Indian Press, were to do that, we would\r\n\r\nmake  no  complaint.  We  believe  in  Democracy.  We\r\n\r\nbelieve  in the right of a free Press. But we believe\r\n\r\nin  a fair, unbiased public radio corporation. We  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  the  wireless to become an  instrument  of\r\n\r\ngovernment  propaganda,  particularly  in   reporting\r\n\r\naccounts of what took place in this Chamber. The only\r\n\r\nway  in  which  a fair and impartial account  can  be\r\n\r\ngiven, other than by the Hansard publication of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  itself,  would be through an  agency  such  as\r\n\r\nRadio  Malaya.  This  raises  important  matters   of\r\n\r\nprinciple, which previous governments had neither the\r\n\r\ninclination  nor  the will to face.  It  is  only  in\r\n\r\ncolonial  territories,  or in Fascist  countries,  or\r\n\r\ntotalitarian countries that radio stations  are  part\r\n\r\nof  the  government machinery of propaganda. In  more\r\n\r\ndemocratic countries they come under the control of a\r\n\r\nboard of trustees of impartial men of integrity,  who\r\n\r\nrun it in the public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterests. Whilst talking on this point, E would draw\r\n\r\nthe  attention of the Chief Minister to what he  must\r\n\r\nknow is a very important matter, which should receive\r\n\r\nhis  early  attention as soon as he has  settled  the\r\n\r\nmore  urgent  matters which now bedevil his  Cabinet.\r\n\r\nBut this is a matter which must be tackled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reliably understand that the present Director of\r\n\r\nBroadcasting in Singapore is going home on leave  for\r\n\r\nconsultations  with  the Colonial  Office  about  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  such  a  public corporation  for  Radio\r\n\r\nMalaya.   It  is  a  good  sign  that  even  colonial\r\n\r\nofficials  can  learn  and can  try  to  live  up  to\r\n\r\ndemocracy, but I think it is more important  that  we\r\n\r\nin  this  Chamber, who represent the  people,  should\r\n\r\ntake  the  initiative,  and  not  leave  it  to  some\r\n\r\nenergetic colonial official.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to make another point in relation\r\n\r\nto proceedings in this Assembly. The Public Relations\r\n\r\nOffice is rightly an instrument for the dissemination\r\n\r\nof  the  Government's  point  of  view  and  for  the\r\n\r\nproviding of facilities to foreign correspondents and\r\n\r\nother  newspapermen  just as the  Central  Office  of\r\n\r\nInformation    in   Britain.   But    when    foreign\r\n\r\ncorrespondents, immediately after the debate in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  go to the offices of the Public  Relations\r\n\r\nDepartment, and can pick up the speech that was  made\r\n\r\nby  the  Hon. the Chief Secretary, and pick  up  the\r\n\r\nspeech  that was made much later in the  day  by  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Chief Minister, but are unable to find  any\r\n\r\nscripts   of   speeches  made  by  Members   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition, I think the process of using  the  Public\r\n\r\nRelations  Office  as  an  instrument  of  government\r\n\r\npropaganda  is  carried a little bit  too  far.  Here\r\n\r\nagain,  I wish to make it clear that I make no charge\r\n\r\nagainst  either  the  Chief Secretary  or  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister personally. But I wish to draw the attention\r\n\r\nof  this  House, publicly, and on the floor  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly to say that that should not be the case.  We\r\n\r\nare  not  saying  that  it was wrong  of  the  Public\r\n\r\nRelations  Office to provide scripted copies  of  the\r\n\r\nspeech  made by the Chief Minister, nor that  of  the\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary, but they should not have done  that\r\n\r\nto the exclusion of speeches\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade by Members on the other side of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can quite believe that the Chief Secretary and\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister are completely unaware  of  this.\r\n\r\nBut I hope, now that I have brought these matters  to\r\n\r\ntheir  attention, that such a very undesirable  bias,\r\n\r\nboth  in  Radio  Malaya and in the  Public  Relations\r\n\r\nOffice,  should not be allowed to continue. They  are\r\n\r\nmatters   which  relate  very  intimately   to   this\r\n\r\nAssembly. I think the Assembly has the right  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Government that all proceedings in this House, if\r\n\r\nthey  are reported in any way through any agency,  or\r\n\r\nthrough  any  medium, over which this Government  and\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly have any control, however remote, such\r\n\r\nreports should be fair, impartial and unbiased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say last week's Radio Malaya's commentary\r\n\r\non  the proceedings, where eleven speakers who  spoke\r\n\r\non  the  motion were dismissed in one line and  which\r\n\r\nsaid \"eleven other people spoke\", is not one that can\r\n\r\nbe  called  fair or impartial by any stretch  of  the\r\n\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Long speeches which contain\r\n\r\nlong  repetitions  might be cut down  to  one  single\r\n\r\nsentence,  and  a  short speech which  contains  more\r\n\r\nsubstance  and  more facts might occupy  much  longer\r\n\r\nspace  both  through Radio Malaya and  in  the  local\r\n\r\nPress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It just occurs to me, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, that this was the occasion,  I  think,\r\n\r\nwhen the People's Action Party was unable to make  up\r\n\r\nits   mind  and  had  to  abstain  from  voting.  If,\r\n\r\nfollowing  a  65-minute speech which  apparently  led\r\n\r\nnowhere, neither he nor his Party knew which  way  to\r\n\r\nvote  and  had  to  abstain, it hardly  seems  to  me\r\n\r\ndeserving of report in that case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much of my thunder has\r\n\r\nalready  been stolen. I fully share some of the  view\r\n\r\nexpressed  by the Member for Tanjong Pagar  (Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew)  that it is important that the proceedings\r\n\r\nin  this  House  should  be  fairly,  accurately  and\r\n\r\nimpartially reported. It is particularly important at\r\n\r\nthis  time,  Sir,  when in certain quarters  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry there is not that degree of freedom of speech\r\n\r\nwhich  we enjoy here. I support that, and I am  quite\r\n\r\nsure   that  you,  Sir,  will  be  jealous  of   that\r\n\r\nprinciple, and that should you ever feel that  it  is\r\n\r\nbeing  abused by any of those who sit in the Gallery,\r\n\r\nyou will not be slow to exercise the powers given  to\r\n\r\nyou under Standing Order 75.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Sir, I regret that the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar should be so upset, not I think  really\r\n\r\nat  his  lack of publicity, but at his bad publicity,\r\n\r\nand that in his vexation he should feel justified  in\r\n\r\ntrying  to  put  the  blame on to two  really  fairly\r\n\r\ninnocuous Government departments. I realise that  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  legacy  hangs  round  our  necks   like   a\r\n\r\nmillstone, but I hope and trust that other Members of\r\n\r\nthis  House are not so obsessed by the bogey  as  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do assure you, Sir, and other Members of the\r\n\r\nHouse that Radio Malaya seeks to cover the debates in\r\n\r\nthis  House  with a purely factual summary  of  those\r\n\r\ndebates.  It  refrains from opinion, and it  refrains\r\n\r\nfrom  comment.  It endeavours to favour  neither  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  nor the Opposition. Whether  or  not,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it  succeeds in this, to me, very  difficult\r\n\r\ntask must be a matter of opinion, and I should expect\r\n\r\nthat  after  any  given debate the opinions  of  each\r\n\r\nParty in this House probably differ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After our sitting on the 26th of April quite a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people criticised to me the  then  report\r\n\r\ngiven by Radio Malaya of our debate and made the most\r\n\r\nunwarranted suggestion that the People's Action Party\r\n\r\nhad  got  hold of Radio Malaya. That was how  it  was\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member  far  Tanjong  Pagar  got  such   a\r\n\r\ntremendous publicity. I had no hesitation  in  saying\r\n\r\nthen, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI say now, that there was no question of Radio Malaya\r\n\r\nbeing nobbled by the People's Action Party. They were\r\n\r\ndoing their best to give a factual report of what had\r\n\r\nhappened, and I think we are all agreed on  that  day\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member did put up a very good and convincing\r\n\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now, after our last sitting apparently, he\r\n\r\ndoes  not think he got sufficient publicity. He makes\r\n\r\nthe  suggestion  that  on the half-past-one  news,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it was, I got ten minutes, and lie got fifteen\r\n\r\nseconds.  Well,  I would point out that  he  finished\r\n\r\nspeaking -  if  I  remember  rightly - at  about  twenty\r\n\r\nminutes  to one of the clock in this House, that  the\r\n\r\nbulletin put over on the half-past-one news had to be\r\n\r\nprepared  and ready for that half-past-one news;  and\r\n\r\nthat  whilst it did naturally devote a good  deal  of\r\n\r\nits time to a speech which had been completed in time\r\n\r\nfor  it to be summarised, the bulletin went on to say\r\n\r\nthat  a  full  report  would be given  later  in  the\r\n\r\nevening.  So  that I would say that  they  did  their\r\n\r\nutmost, again, to be quite fair. But I do not for one\r\n\r\nminute  accept  the criterion that because  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  speaks for sixty-five minutes the  length  of\r\n\r\ncoverage  in Radio Malaya or in the Press  should  be\r\n\r\ndirectly  related to the length of time he  takes  to\r\n\r\ntell us what is in his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also a very real check. We are not solely\r\n\r\ndependent on Radio Malaya. We have a very strong  and\r\n\r\nrepresentative  Press  section  to  listen   to   our\r\n\r\ndebates, and I think we can rely upon them to correct\r\n\r\nany  unbalance or any human failure on  the  part  of\r\n\r\nRadio Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Public Relations Department, as I\r\n\r\nsee  it  the  position  is  slightly  different.  The\r\n\r\nprimary  function of the Public Relations  Department\r\n\r\nis  to  inform the public of Government policies  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  decisions, and to  give  explanations  of\r\n\r\nGovernment's actions. I think it is a well recognised\r\n\r\npart  of  that function in most territories that  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Relations Department should endeavour to  get\r\n\r\nout texts of important speeches made by Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  know  this  is  not  an  easy  task  for  them  to\r\n\r\ndischarge. They did make a very creditable effort  at\r\n\r\nour  last debate, and they managed to get out  fairly\r\n\r\nfull texts of the speeches made by my hon. Friend the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  and by myself. It  would  have  been\r\n\r\nquite  impractical  for them  to  have  attempted  to\r\n\r\nperform  that  service  for the  Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar, and I do not think, Sir, that that is strictly\r\n\r\npart of their functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Sir, in conclusion, not I hope\r\n\r\nappearing  to  be an arrogant colonial  official,  to\r\n\r\ntry,  if I may, to speak as one who has had now quite\r\n\r\na   number  of  years'  experience  of  speaking   in\r\n\r\nLegislatures; somewhat rashly I would venture to give\r\n\r\nthree tips to the Member for Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tip is that he should not expect that the\r\n\r\ncoverage he will get in the Press and radio  will  be\r\n\r\nrelated to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe time it takes him to speak in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second tip I would give him is that he should\r\n\r\nendeavour  to marshal his arguments and his sentences\r\n\r\nshortly, so that it is easy not only for this  House,\r\n\r\nbut  for  our guests to understand what he is driving\r\n\r\nat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, thirdly, when he indulges in one of his cold,\r\n\r\npenetrating  rapier  thrusts  at  Ministers  on   the\r\n\r\nopposite side of the House to himself, he should make\r\n\r\ncertain,  when he drops his voice, that he  drops  it\r\n\r\ninto  the microphone and not on to the middle of  the\r\n\r\nTable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at 4.15 p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">the 29th of June, 1955.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><div align=\"center\"><i>Wednesday, 25th May, 1955</i></div><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TRADE AND AGRICULTURAL FAIR</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and Industry whether, in view of Government's declared policy \"to foster the expansion of our great\r\n\r\nentrepot trade\" and \"to encourage in all practical ways the development of local industries\", he will consider expanding the Agricultural Fair, announced to be held this year, into a Trade and Agricultural Fair, giving special emphasis to local agricultural and industrial products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Hart:</b> pursuant to his reply [Official Report, 26th April, 1955; Volume 1, No. 2, column 1] supplied the following information:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official records indicate that the value of exports to hard currency countries (American Account Countries and Canada) from Malaya, including re-exports, for the years 1952, 1953 and 1954 were as under: -\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n     1952      M$792.1 million\r\n\r\n     1953      M$590.0    \"\r\n\r\n     1954      M$585.4    \"\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br>There are also certain receipts from tourists, for services rendered, and in respect of personal remittances made to Malaya, but detailed information is not available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct imports into the Federation and Singapore from hard currency areas for the years 1952, 1953 and 1954 were as under: -\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n     1952      M$172.7 million\r\n\r\n     1953      M$ 87.5    \"\r\n\r\n     1954      M$ 92.7    \"\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large remittances are made to American and Canadian Accounts in London for invisible imports. Film royalties payable to American companies represent a considerable item under this heading. These payments are of course the equivalent of hard currency expenditure. Arrangements have also been in force for a number of years to reimburse Indonesia in dollars for the re-export to the U.S.A. of rubber imported from Indonesia. Substantial annual payments are made under this heading. Finally, in order to obtain a complete picture of Malaya's dollar expenditure it would be necessary to take into account the hard currency content of manufactured goods imported by Malaya from other members of the Sterling Area. A typical example is tobacco. Figures for these are not available but it is certain that the gap between hard currency earned and hard currency spent by Malaya is much narrower than the figures for visible exports and imports suggest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no fixed allowance for such imports. The policy in the Federation and Singapore, as in other countries of the Sterling Area, is to permit imports from hard currency sources of any commodity regarded as essential for local economies. In the years in question, a wide range of manufactured products and materials for local industries and of general consumer goods have been purchased. Arrangements exist to enable specific items to be considered on the basis of individual applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sterling Area dollar pool is a central reserve maintained by the United Kingdom into which member countries credit their dollar earnings and from which they are provided with dollars on the basis of the particular needs of each territory. This procedure ensures that the essential hard currency needs of Singapore and the Federation are met, and that full use is made of the hard currency earned by the Sterling area as a whole. Pooling of gold\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand dollar reserves strengthens sterling, enhances its international status and brings nearer the prospect of full sterling convertibility. These factors are all of vital interest to an international trading centre such as Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian and U.S. dollar earnings which accrue to Malaya from the activities of individual traders are sold to banks in Singapore and the Federation at the official rate ruling at the time of sale. These rates are in fact the current market rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MANUAL WORKERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Employment statistics)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Labour and Welfare whether he will state -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the number of manual workers employed in Singapore on (i) 31st March, 1954, (ii) 30th September, 1954, and (iii) 31st March, 1955;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the daily average of applicants for employment at the Government Employment Exchange (i) during 1953, (ii) during 1954, and (iii) during the first four months of 1955; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the daily average placings in employment by the Exchange in the same periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> (a) The number of labourers (as defined by the Labour Ordinance) employed in Singapore on -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 31st March, 1954 was 122,964;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) 30th September, 1954 was 120,088;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) 31st March, 1955 is not yet available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The daily average of new applicants for registration for employment at the Government Employment Exchange -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) during 1953 was 67;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) during 1954 was 70;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) during 1955 (first four months) was 64.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The daily average placings in employment by the Exchange -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) during 1953 was 24;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) during 1954 was 15;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) during 1955 (first four months) was 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>JUNIOR TECHNICAL SCHOOL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Evening classes)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Education whether he will state the numbers of applicants received for evening classes in each of the 16 subjects in the Junior Technical School for the school year which commenced on 2nd May, 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The numbers enrolled in the various evening classes were: -\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n   Building Construction               169\r\n\r\n   Building Quantities                 100\r\n\r\n   Surveying and Levelling              45\r\n\r\n   Structural Engineering               80\r\n\r\n   Mechanical Engineering               97\r\n\r\n   Radio and Telecommunications        158\r\n\r\n   Refrigeration                        10\r\n\r\n   Mathematics                          75\r\n\r\n   General Science                      24\r\n\r\n   Technical Drawing                    56\r\n\r\n   Plumbing                            181\r\n\r\n   Carpentry                            24\r\n\r\n   Gas Fitting                           4\r\n\r\n   Motor Vehicle Work                   73\r\n\r\n   Electricians                         86\r\n\r\n   Brickwork                            -\r\n\r\n                                     -----\r\n\r\n                                     1,182\r\n\r\n                                     -----\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br>All who applied during the week specified in the press notice were admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>X-RAY EXAMINATION OF SCHOOL CHILDREN</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Health whether he will state how many school-children, expressed (i) in terms of the total number of (a) boys and (b) girls and (ii) as a percentage of (a) boys and (b) girls at school, have been X-rayed for signs of tuberculosis in 1952, 1953, 1954 and the first four months of 1955 respectively; what percentage of the total were X-rayed (a) in Government clinics and (b) at the S.A.T.A. clinic on behalf of Government; and what is Government's policy in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.
