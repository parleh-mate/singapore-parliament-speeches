It is  not  possible  to\r\n\r\nexplain  in  detail  the salary  structure  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  service  as  against the qualifications  of\r\n\r\nChinese  school teachers, because the  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Changi, who is absent today, will not be  able\r\n\r\nto  understand  it.  It is not because  the  salary\r\n\r\nstructure   is   complicated,   but   because   the\r\n\r\nqualifications of Chinese school teachers are  more\r\n\r\ncomplicated  than  is  the  salary  structure;  the\r\n\r\nreason  being  that for a long time, while  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools were outside the control\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  my Ministry, the teachers were recruited by the\r\n\r\nschool committees of management without any uniform\r\n\r\nrequirements  at  all  as to their  qualifications.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it is no wonder that the assessment  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese   qualifications   has   caused   so   much\r\n\r\ndifficulty.  If there is any teacher who  does  not\r\n\r\nknow  how  his salary is arrived at by my Ministry,\r\n\r\nthe  proper course open to him is to make enquiries\r\n\r\nfrom my Staff Officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of University degrees and their\r\n\r\nrecognition, I must remind the hon.

The function  of this\r\n\r\nCouncil is to educate the adults who could not  and\r\n\r\ndid not attend either primary or secondary schools.\r\n\r\nThe  Council  are  now conducting about  630  night\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclasses  teaching in almost all languages,  in  the\r\n\r\nAdult  Education Association. Sir, when the  Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution comes to an end, elections to the next\r\n\r\nAssembly will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nready and the voters in Singapore will have to play\r\n\r\na  more  important  part than  they  were  hitherto\r\n\r\ndoing.  Double  the number of Assemblymen  will  he\r\n\r\nelected from more than double the number of voters.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is as important to educate the adults\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  to educate the children, not only as voters but\r\n\r\nalso as parents. If the adults of today are steeped\r\n\r\nin  prejudice or superstition or some sort  of  bad\r\n\r\nbehaviour  of  one kind or another,  naturally  the\r\n\r\nchildren will inherit these habits in spite of  all\r\n\r\nthe  textbook  knowledge pumped into them,  and  we\r\n\r\nwould not be able to get independence in Singapore.\r\n\r\nSo,  Sir, it is important, as I have told  you, to\r\n\r\neducate the adults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen in this Estimate, for the Council for\r\n\r\nAdult  Education,  that only $500,000  is  allowed.\r\n\r\nSir,  we  have  in Singapore, 252,000  children  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprimary schools, 42,000 in secondary schools, 3,000\r\n\r\nin  universities,  and 2,000 in technical  schools.\r\n\r\nTherefore, out of a total of 300,000 children after\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompleting  primary  education,  we  have   roughly\r\n\r\n45,000   children   attending  secondary   schools,\r\n\r\nuniversities  and  technical  schools.  Sir,   what\r\n\r\nhappens to the other 255,000 children? They are not\r\n\r\ngetting  any  further education. At  least  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  these children, apart  from  so  many\r\n\r\nadults  who  wish  to  educate  themselves,   adult\r\n\r\neducation is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to convince the Members of this Assembly, I\r\n\r\nam  quoting from the Annual Report of the Singapore\r\n\r\nCouncil for Adult Education presented to the Annual\r\n\r\nConference on 6th December, 1958, page 1:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Though we hope for a greater expansion in our\r\n\r\nactivities this year, because of the economy  drive\r\n\r\nof  the Government of Singapore, we have had to  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with  consolidating what  we  have  done\r\n\r\nrather than to increase our classes. Originally  we\r\n\r\nhad  planned $613,317 estimate for the year  to  be\r\n\r\nreceived  from  Government grant. This  had  to  be\r\n\r\nreduced to $522,387 estimate. Hence, there has been\r\n\r\nlittle  expansion, and out of the request  for  204\r\n\r\nmore  new classes in basic education, only 51 could\r\n\r\nbe approved. We had to be satisfied again with only\r\n\r\na token grant of $10 for cultural education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be pointed out that though, from\r\n\r\nGovernment,  we  have received $522,387  the  total\r\n\r\nexpenses of the Council have been in the region  of\r\n\r\n$700,000,  the  balance  being  met  from  our  own\r\n\r\nGeneral Fund. In our opinion, in the present  stage\r\n\r\nof  rapid  development in Singapore  and  with  its\r\n\r\nlarge  body  of new citizens, to curtail  our  work\r\n\r\nwould  be disastrous to the community and it should\r\n\r\nbe  strongly urged that it is the responsibility of\r\n\r\nthe  Government to help us to expand our  work.  To\r\n\r\nreduce one adult class means one policeman less.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I will just quote one more sentence from page 6:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Basic Education Committee met on 15th\r\n\r\nOctober,  1958,  and  considered  various  possible\r\n\r\nmeasures.

Members\r\n\r\nwill  notice  in the Estimates that the  grant  for\r\n\r\nnext  year  in respect of the Council for Education\r\n\r\nis  the  same  as the grant for this year.  At  the\r\n\r\noutset, I think I must explain that the Council for\r\n\r\nAdult  Education was formed on one  principle,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is to provide literacy classes for the  adult\r\n\r\npopulation.  It is not supposed to run classes  for\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry,  and  therefore there  must  not  be\r\n\r\nduplication  of classes such as providing  lectures\r\n\r\non   Cambridge  examination  subjects,   commercial\r\n\r\nsubjects and further education. These are being run\r\n\r\nby  my Ministry in many spheres, such as commercial\r\n\r\nschools  running in several centres. We  have  also\r\n\r\nsecondary   commercial  schools.   Therefore,   the\r\n\r\nCouncil  should  not duplicate the work  and  incur\r\n\r\nunnecessary expenditure. The Council should confine\r\n\r\nitself to providing literacy classes for adults for\r\n\r\nwhich  it  is  formed and not embark  on  providing\r\n\r\nclasses  on  further  education,  instituting   law\r\n\r\nlectures and such like subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I admit that the Council's constitution does give\r\n\r\nit very wide powers and room for discretion, but as\r\n\r\nI am entrusted with public funds I cannot allow the\r\n\r\nCouncil   to  go  on  merrily  spending  money   on\r\n\r\nduplicated  work without a check.

It  is  because   this   year   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  and  the Ministry of Education  itself\r\n\r\nhave  started  offering  facilities  for  secondary\r\n\r\nlevel  classes  in  the evening  that  the  Further\r\n\r\nEducation Committee decided to start economising by\r\n\r\ncutting down secondary level classes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.15 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this clears the Minister's anxiety\r\n\r\nthat the Council are spending more money on further\r\n\r\neducation.  I shall quote some figures to  convince\r\n\r\nthe  Minister.  Sir,  the  total  amount  of  money\r\n\r\nallowed  by  the  Ministry to the  Adult  Education\r\n\r\nCouncil is $500,000. Sir, the Minister admits  that\r\n\r\nbasic  education is necessary. For teachers' salary\r\n\r\nand   basic   education  alone,  they  have   spent\r\n\r\n$364,954.   For   teachers'  salary   and   further\r\n\r\neducation  (that  is  what the  Hon, the  Minister\r\n\r\ncomplains  about) - only $36,990 was spent.  But  the\r\n\r\nfees collected from students on basic education is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$129,050;  and  the  students'  fees  for   further\r\n\r\neducation, which the Minister complains  about,  is\r\n\r\n$27,596.90 cents. Sir, this figure shows that, from\r\n\r\nthe grant which this Council have received from the\r\n\r\nMinistry, they have not wasted anything. They  have\r\n\r\nconducted  classes for basic education;  they  have\r\n\r\nalmost  maintained themselves. They have  collected\r\n\r\nfees  from  students for further  education,  which\r\n\r\nwere  sufficient to maintain their classes. I think\r\n\r\nthe  Hon, the  Minister need not be anxious  about\r\n\r\ntheir  wasting money. Actually they are  not.  They\r\n\r\nhave more or less stopped all these classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Does the hon.

Do I understand that there will be  places\r\n\r\nin the evening classes for all the students who are\r\n\r\nnot  able to gain entry into normal schools?  Do  I\r\n\r\nunderstand again that the evening classes  will  be\r\n\r\nrun  on  more or less the same footing as  the  day\r\n\r\nschools,  enabling the students who  join  them  to\r\n\r\ncome  up  to  the  level of Senior  Middle  III  in\r\n\r\nChinese   schools   and   the   Cambridge    School\r\n\r\nCertificate  in the English stream? If  it  is  the\r\n\r\ncase, then I think the people of Singapore will not\r\n\r\nhave  any  grouse at all. It assists them  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal. Of course, when I am talking about this, I do\r\n\r\nnot for one moment forget about students who may be\r\n\r\nat  school  all  the  time and yet  are  unable  to\r\n\r\nbenefit by it. I am aware that there may be a great\r\n\r\nnumber  of  students  whose parents  want  them  to\r\n\r\nbecome  great men - doctors, lawyers and all that - and\r\n\r\nthey cannot even pass Standard V or VI. Now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  useful outlet must be found for such  people,\r\n\r\nand  I wonder if the Minister has in mind plans  to\r\n\r\nassist  them,  to help them with  some  sort  of  a\r\n\r\nvocation  so  that  at that age,  when  they  leave\r\n\r\nschool  and are not able to go for further studies,\r\n\r\nand too young to get a job, they are able to absorb\r\n\r\nsome  useful  learning of some sort at institutions\r\n\r\nwhich  will  train them for a job. I am aware  that\r\n\r\nthe Minister has had that plan in mind for quite  a\r\n\r\nlong  time, but it has not been put into  practice - for reasons which I do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also remind the Minister that there are\r\n\r\nwelfare organizations which are prepared to  assist\r\n\r\nGovernment in that direction. In fact, last year  I\r\n\r\nmade  an  offer to the Minister that the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Boys'  Clubs  has  been  thinking  of  starting\r\n\r\nclasses - in  fact, they have started  classes  which\r\n\r\nteach  motor repairing, wood-work, and  such  other\r\n\r\ncrafts - and  that they would be prepared  to  assist\r\n\r\nthe Ministry in helping these young people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, which I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister   is  the  policy  in  respect  of   youth\r\n\r\nmovements  in  Singapore. We have had the  Ministry\r\n\r\nsending  over to us representatives to sit  on  our\r\n\r\nManagement Committee, to learn and assist the youth\r\n\r\nmovement, the Federation of Boys' Clubs. Previously\r\n\r\nthey  had  an officer sent to us. This officer,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, had notices of meetings sent to him all the\r\n\r\ntime,  but he never attended meetings! However,  we\r\n\r\nare  grateful  to  the  Ministry  for  sending  the\r\n\r\npresent  officer, Mr Peter Lim, to  represent  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   on   our  Committee,   because   he   is\r\n\r\nparticularly  interested in the youth movement  and\r\n\r\nhas   been   very  helpful - suggesting  a   lot   of\r\n\r\nimprovements  and  ways  of co-operating  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistries  for  the  betterment  of  youth.  I  am\r\n\r\ntalking about this co-operation in connection  with\r\n\r\nthe  limited  playing fields we have in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAll this time the Ministry has assured us that they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  help  us out over this matter at the  highest\r\n\r\nlevel;  but  when it comes to actual  practice,  we\r\n\r\nfind the red tape is such that it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalmost  impossible  to make use of  school  playing\r\n\r\nfields!  We  have  put forward  our  views  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  that schools are meant for the youths  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and whether they are within school hours\r\n\r\nor outside school hours, they should be made use of\r\n\r\ninstead  of being left idle. We have not  had  much\r\n\r\nsuccess at that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to know that the\r\n\r\neducation of our young people must not be  confined\r\n\r\nonly  to  classrooms, and to within  the  hours  of\r\n\r\nteaching in schools, but that it should be an  all-round affair, and we should take care of our youths\r\n\r\ninside the schools as well as outside them. If  the\r\n\r\nyouth movements are prepared to help Government  on\r\n\r\nthat  basis,  to look after the young  people  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  out  of school and see  that  they  have\r\n\r\nsomething useful to do, instead of ganging up  with\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  type of people, then Government  should\r\n\r\nhelp  them. I am certain that if the Minister  will\r\n\r\nassure  us  in this House that he will do  so,  and\r\n\r\nthat  he  will give a directive to all his officers\r\n\r\nconcerned  to  give  the youth movements  full  and\r\n\r\ntangible co-operation in helping the young  people,\r\n\r\nit will be appreciated by all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M.

Sir, we  all  know\r\n\r\neducation   is  very  important  in   this   world.\r\n\r\nEducation is a human problem and also a human need,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  health  and housing. We must  pay  particular\r\n\r\nattention  to  education,  particularly   for   the\r\n\r\nyounger set. The Government say they are unable  to\r\n\r\nbuild  more secondary schools on the flimsy  excuse\r\n\r\nthat   they   are  unable  to  recruit   able   and\r\n\r\nexperienced teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must have teachers.

These\r\n\r\nthree totals of grant for Free Text Books amount to\r\n\r\n$151,000  for 1959 as against the $300,000 provided\r\n\r\nfor  this  year. Why has this amount been  reduced?\r\n\r\nSir,  we know very well that free textbooks  should\r\n\r\nbe provided for the children of those who are poor.\r\n\r\nThey  cannot even pay the school fees. They  cannot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npay for the textbooks. So Government has provided a\r\n\r\ngrant  for  free textbooks. But now Government  has\r\n\r\nthe  effrontery to reduce this amount. Why?  I  can\r\n\r\ntell  you  the reason. It is because many of  these\r\n\r\nstudents  have  been kicked out of  school  because\r\n\r\nthey  have  failed in their examinations.  We  know\r\n\r\nvery  well  that  the population  of  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nincreasing. Year in and year out we have  more  and\r\n\r\nmore  children  attending school. I am  quite  sure\r\n\r\nmany people will be affected by this reduced grant.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Ministry of Education doing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect of Government which I\r\n\r\nhave already condemned, and that is, they only know\r\n\r\nhow  to  look  after their own interest.

Do  you  know\r\n\r\nhow  much  worry,  anxiety and trouble  the  school\r\n\r\nchildren went through to prepare themselves for the\r\n\r\nexaminations?   After   having    sat    for    the\r\n\r\nexaminations,  we can imagine their  disappointment\r\n\r\nwhen  they  came back home and the news  broke  out\r\n\r\nthat  the  examination papers could be  bought  for\r\n\r\n$30.  Sir, you know of this situation. The  leakage\r\n\r\nhappened  not only in the English schools but  also\r\n\r\nin the Chinese schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for so many years under the Colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment - I  was  educated in a Government  school\r\n\r\nfor nearly ten years - we never heard of such a silly\r\n\r\nthing  as a leakage of examination papers. We never\r\n\r\nheard  that examination papers could be bought  for\r\n\r\n$30.  If  there are any excuses which the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education  could give, I would  still  not  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied,  because as Minister for  Education,  he\r\n\r\nmust  be  responsible for his Ministry. It  is  his\r\n\r\nduty to see that his Ministry is properly run,  and\r\n\r\nhe  should not blame the Printing Office or anybody\r\n\r\nelse.  He may cry to heaven and earth!

Does the Minister\r\n\r\nknow  that when a parent has four or five children,\r\n\r\nhe  would  naturally prefer them to go to the  same\r\n\r\nschool  or  to  schools nearest his home?

Do\r\n\r\nyou  know  what has happened? I will refer  to  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  a  parent living in my area. One  of  his\r\n\r\nchildren  was studying in Tiong Bahru  School.  The\r\n\r\nnext  child  was  posted to Trafalgar  School.  The\r\n\r\nthird  child,  who was registered  at  Tiong  Bahru\r\n\r\nSchool,  was  given the excuse that there  were  no\r\n\r\nmore  places. They said they were sorry, and  could\r\n\r\nnot  find him a place in Tiong Bahru School. He was\r\n\r\nposted instead to Kim Seng Road (West) School.  The\r\n\r\nfourth  child was transferred to Trafalgar  School.\r\n\r\nImagine a parent having his four children going  to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthree different schools! In addition to the members\r\n\r\nof his family whom he has to support, he has to pay\r\n\r\nrent. He has to pay everything on a salary of, say,\r\n\r\n$150 or $200. With all these commitments, he has to\r\n\r\nsend   four   children  to  different  schools   in\r\n\r\ndifferent parts of the island. Has he enough  time,\r\n\r\nor  can  he  take  the trouble to send  his  little\r\n\r\nchildren to Trafalgar School, Kim Seng Road  (West)\r\n\r\nSchool,  and  Tiong  Bahru  School - three  different\r\n\r\nplaces, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, for one, Sir, send my children every morning\r\n\r\nto school - to three different schools. I do not mind\r\n\r\nthat  much,  Sir, because I can get in my  car  and\r\n\r\nsend  them  off. But can an ordinary  working-class\r\n\r\nparent,  who has four children, do the  same?  Some\r\n\r\nwives  may have lost their husbands, or a housewife\r\n\r\nmay  have  a tiny tot nestling in her arms.  Do  we\r\n\r\nexpect this woman to send her children to different\r\n\r\nschools,  when their ages may be just around  seven\r\n\r\nto  nine years? Is it fair to this poor woman? When\r\n\r\nyou  ask  the principal of a school to put all  the\r\n\r\nchildren  in the same school, he will  say:  \"I  am\r\n\r\nsorry,  I cannot do anything.

The\r\n\r\nexcuse is every time given that it is the Almighty,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Education, or  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation,   who  controls  the  destiny   of   our\r\n\r\nchildren.   The  Minister  may  be   God   in   his\r\n\r\nDepartment, but I have the liberty to speak in this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister then talked about secondary schools.\r\n\r\nHe  said  that  many  children,  on  passing  their\r\n\r\nprimary school examination, would go to a trade  or\r\n\r\na technical school.

For example, we  notice  in  the\r\n\r\npapers   that   15,000  students  sat   for   their\r\n\r\nexaminations, and only 7,000 were accepted, leaving\r\n\r\n8,000  students stranded. Do not forget  that  they\r\n\r\nare  the citizens of tomorrow. These 8,000 students\r\n\r\nwill  be our people. Yet he is talking about  trade\r\n\r\nschools and technical schools. He likes them to  go\r\n\r\nthere. Sir, may I also remind the Minister that  it\r\n\r\nis  the  parents' wish to decide what education  is\r\n\r\ngood  for their children? The Minister has no right\r\n\r\nto  dictate to me and ask me to send my children to\r\n\r\na  trade  school. In my case, I will not listen  to\r\n\r\nhis  advice.  I will choose to send my children  to\r\n\r\nany  school  I like, whether to a trade  school,  a\r\n\r\nsecondary  or a carpentry school, or any  school  I\r\n\r\nlike.

It is also because the Government want\r\n\r\nto  save money, as in the case of the reduction  in\r\n\r\nthe grant of free textbooks, under cover that it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to economise in order to give  education\r\n\r\nfor all.

Members\r\n\r\nnot  to  make any personal references to honourable\r\n\r\nMembers,  but  to get on with the  debate.  We  are\r\n\r\ndebating Government policy, and, therefore, whether\r\n\r\nan honourable Member is an ex-Democrat or not makes\r\n\r\nno  difference.

I wonder whether the Minister for Education\r\n\r\ncan  recollect  what  he  said  yesterday  when  he\r\n\r\nanswered  my first question. What is the policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  right  now  in  building  so  many\r\n\r\nschools  and  granting  so  much  money - even  those\r\n\r\nschools which we call vernacular schools under  the\r\n\r\nitem of Grants-in-Aid - spending so much money -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We have completed the debate\r\n\r\non  Grants-in-Aid  on the honourable  Member's  own\r\n\r\namendment.  He was not here this morning  when  the\r\n\r\nMinister  replied  to  his amendment.  A  vote  was\r\n\r\ntaken, and therefore this topic of Grants-in-Aid is\r\n\r\nnow closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.45 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am fully aware of my\r\n\r\nposition.  The Minister gave me an answer yesterday\r\n\r\nthat he is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  the Minister for Employment. Therefore, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  his duty to answer my query as to what  is  in\r\n\r\nhis mind or in his Government's mind in respect  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  education policy - whether he  has  made\r\n\r\nany  move to co-ordinate our education policy on  a\r\n\r\nPan-Malayan  basis.  That is,  of  course,  what  I\r\n\r\nintended to mean. So I can quote, to show my  point\r\n\r\non  what I already said yesterday on this question,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Sin  Chew  Jit Poh of yesterday's  date.\r\n\r\nThere is a feature article written by a student  by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe name of Tsu-hua, a new graduate from the Senior\r\n\r\nMiddle High School.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December 17th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\"MY ACCUSATION\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name-Tsu-hua\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confession of a newly senior graduated student\".</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to save time I will just quote two\r\n\r\nsentences. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>\"GRADUATION MEANS UNEMPLOYMENT\"</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy  I purposely wish to quote this feature article\r\n\r\nis  that  I want to emphasise the line along  which\r\n\r\nour education policy is taking in this country. The\r\n\r\neducation policy cannot be separated from  language\r\n\r\nand  culture. One curious thing about this  country\r\n\r\nis  that, as I have already explained once or twice\r\n\r\nbefore, on the eve of the Rendel Constitution there\r\n\r\nwas a controversy on multilingualism. It was argued\r\n\r\nthat multilingualism should be introduced into this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  with equal treatment for all  languages;\r\n\r\nfor  example,  by  adopting a bilingual  system  of\r\n\r\neducation in this country. Now, on the eve  of  the\r\n\r\nLennox-Boyd  Constitution, we have a  most  serious\r\n\r\nquestion on language being raised. It is that Malay\r\n\r\nshould be the lingua franca of this country. Sir, I\r\n\r\nwonder  why all political leaders who champion  the\r\n\r\ncause  of  making  the  Malay language  the  lingua\r\n\r\nfranca are not interested in this debate so that we\r\n\r\nmay   be   given   a  more  detailed   explanation,\r\n\r\nespecially  from  someone  who  has  sat   on   the\r\n\r\nEducation Committee. This Committee has decided and\r\n\r\nformulated  our  education  policy - a  policy  which\r\n\r\ngives  equal  treatment to all  schools;  in  other\r\n\r\nwords, English schools, Malay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools,  Chinese  schools and Tamil  schools.  Now\r\n\r\nsuddenly on the eve of the elections, we have  this\r\n\r\nserious question of language being raised, that is,\r\n\r\nMalay  must be made the lingua franca of Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I wish to take this opportunity  to  ask\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Education  whether  it  is   a\r\n\r\npolitical   move  or  whether  it  is  actually   a\r\n\r\nnecessity  for  this  country, especially  when  we\r\n\r\nconsider  the Budget lying in front of us.  We  can\r\n\r\nsee  how  much money is going to be spent on  Malay\r\n\r\neducation and how much money is going to  be  spent\r\n\r\non English, Chinese and Tamil schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish also the Minister for Education to answer\r\n\r\nthis  question.  What improvement  is  expected  in\r\n\r\nintroducing various languages in English  schools'?\r\n\r\nWe  learn  that Chinese is being taught in  English\r\n\r\nschools, Malay in English schools, Tamil in English\r\n\r\nschools. What progress has been made? I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether he has at hand any figures of any survey to\r\n\r\nshow  the  extent of the cultural  stream  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry, and the various cultural influences  which\r\n\r\nhave  an  important bearing on our  life.  Has  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  failed  to  tell  the  people  and  the\r\n\r\nleaders  (of  course,  not  much  blame  should  be\r\n\r\nattached  to  the  Education Ministry  alone)  that\r\n\r\nmultilingual education has already been accepted in\r\n\r\nthis  country as our education policy?  Why  is  it\r\n\r\nthat  on the eve of the elections the question  has\r\n\r\nbeen raised to make Malay the lingua franca in this\r\n\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have figures supplied by my friend, Mr\r\n\r\nGeorge   Thomson,  about  the  various   newspapers\r\n\r\ncirculating in Malaya and Singapore. A large figure\r\n\r\nof  about 400,000 copies a day is given as being in\r\n\r\ncirculation.  But, Sir, you will be surprised  that\r\n\r\namong these 400,000 copies of various newspapers of\r\n\r\nvarious  languages,  the  Chinese  newspapers  have\r\n\r\n210,000  copies,  excluding  magazines,  and  those\r\n\r\nwhich  we  call \"mosquito\" papers. We  are  judging\r\n\r\nonly  from the Chinese language newspapers. Of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish language papers, the figure given is  about\r\n\r\n130,000 to 140,000 copies a day. Malay is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout 30,000 to 40,000 copies a day. Tamil is about\r\n\r\n7  per  cent of the total. Therefore, judging  from\r\n\r\nthe   papers,   we  can  know  which  language   is\r\n\r\ninfluential and which language is popular  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  Yet, Sir, at this juncture  when  we  are\r\n\r\njust  coming towards self-government, we have  this\r\n\r\nlanguage  question being raised again.  I  want  to\r\n\r\nknow why. If I am not wrong, even in the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya, the Chinese Schools Conference on Malay\r\n\r\nhave forced the M.C.A. to have a big conference  in\r\n\r\nIpoh  not long ago to fight for the Chinese to make\r\n\r\nChinese  an official language in the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. On the contrary, Sir, in Singapore  we  see\r\n\r\nsome  ambitious, selfish and shortsighted political\r\n\r\nleaders  who  want to confuse the  issue  again  by\r\n\r\nbringing  up  this  controversy,  since  they  have\r\n\r\nalready  said  that the Progressives were  strongly\r\n\r\nagainst   multilingualism.  Now   where   are   the\r\n\r\nProgressives?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This language problem arises again on the eve of\r\n\r\nthe  Lennox-Boyd Constitution. I wish the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education can give us a clear-cut analysis,  so\r\n\r\nthat  we can recollect what we have agreed  in  the\r\n\r\nAll-Party Committee on Education, and whether  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  is now prepared to persuade the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  to make Malay the lingua  franca  of\r\n\r\nthis  country,  and deny the Chinese language,  the\r\n\r\nEnglish language, the Tamil language, the status of\r\n\r\nofficial languages. What we have agreed to have  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is multi-lingualism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you may be surprised at what connection all\r\n\r\nthis  has with our education policy. I have  quoted\r\n\r\nfrom  a newspaper which says that \"graduation means\r\n\r\nunemployment\". A student, either from  the  primary\r\n\r\nschool  or from Nanyang University, does  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  to do or where to go after graduation.  After\r\n\r\nhe  has  spent, say, 17 years of his  education  in\r\n\r\nChinese,  he  is  told suddenly to  take  up  Malay\r\n\r\nbecause  this country has not accepted the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage as the official language. That would  mean\r\n\r\nmore unemployment. There would be no chance to find\r\n\r\nemployment. Therefore, to me the education  policy,\r\n\r\nespecially one that has a Pan-Malayan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutlook,  is  of vital importance to this  country.\r\n\r\nEvery  language in this multi-racial country should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe respected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a very poor linguist, and I know very little\r\n\r\nof  languages. Yet I do not care. Language is  only\r\n\r\njust  an  instrument  of expression.  The  language\r\n\r\nitself  is,  I  should  say,  a  dead  or  lifeless\r\n\r\ninstrument.  It is only our feelings  and  thoughts\r\n\r\nthat  make  the language lively and beautiful.  Why\r\n\r\nmust  we  deny the Chinese language and the English\r\n\r\nlanguage  their  proper place in our  culture?  Why\r\n\r\nshould  we  elect, on the eve of the elections,  to\r\n\r\nhail  the  Malay language, and make it  the  lingua\r\n\r\nfranca of Singapore? We do not have the courage  to\r\n\r\ntell  our  people  here  that  language  itself  is\r\n\r\nnothing; that it is lifeless. It is the person (his\r\n\r\nthoughts,  his mind and his feelings) who  controls\r\n\r\nand  exercises  it,  and who  uses  it  to  express\r\n\r\nhimself, that counts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many Englishmen in this world today can\r\n\r\nchallenge  the beautiful English, either in  speech\r\n\r\nor in writing, of Mr Nehru? How many English poets\r\n\r\ndare  to  deny that the Indian poet Tagore  is  not\r\n\r\ngreat?  Who can say that, because Tagore and  Nehru\r\n\r\nare  so  expert in the use of the English language,\r\n\r\ntherefore  they  are traitors? That  they  are  not\r\n\r\ngenuine nationalists? Nobody dares to deny that. In\r\n\r\nthis  country, I think none of us has made so  much\r\n\r\nsacrifices as Mr Nehru had when he fought for  his\r\n\r\ncountry's  independence.  It  is  a  shame  to  the\r\n\r\nnational  leaders in this country who have achieved\r\n\r\nhigh  positions.  I  am  not  excluding  myself.  I\r\n\r\ninclude  myself! It is a real shame!  We  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  imprisoned for one day. We have  not  shed  a\r\n\r\nsingle  drop  of  blood. Yet  we  say  we  are  the\r\n\r\nchampions  of  nationalism!  We  must  abolish  the\r\n\r\nEnglish   language!  We  must  deny   the   Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage! Instead, we must hail the Malay language!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have full confidence in and great respect for\r\n\r\nTunku Abdul Rahman's wisdom, sincerity and honesty.\r\n\r\nI bet you, Sir, the U.M.N.O. leaders never fool the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalay  ra'ayat. The Malay ra'ayat have  never  been\r\n\r\nfooled  by  opportunists who say that  if  we  hail\r\n\r\nMalay as the lingua\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfranca,  there  will  be  a  merger  and  all  the\r\n\r\ntrouble in this country can be resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to go a bit deeper into this\r\n\r\nsubject.  We  have read from the Press  that  there\r\n\r\nwere riots in Ceylon, Bombay and Calcutta - three big\r\n\r\ncities.  Over  what,  Sir? Over  the  language  and\r\n\r\ncultural   issues.  After  that,   racial   clashes\r\n\r\nfollowed.  So  this is a serious warning  for  this\r\n\r\ncountry. I hope the Minister for Education can give\r\n\r\nus  an assurance that he will not make Singapore  a\r\n\r\nsecond   Ceylon  and  have  language  and  cultural\r\n\r\nconflicts just over the question of language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.00 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the students in all schools have a full\r\n\r\nassurance  that what they learn in school  will  be\r\n\r\nuseful to the country in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding my speech on the general aspect of\r\n\r\nlanguage, I have two questions to ask the Minister.\r\n\r\nHas he decided to open all available classrooms  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  schools?  From information  I  have  gathered,\r\n\r\nthere  are  vacant classrooms in Chung  Cheng  High\r\n\r\nSchool and Chung Hwa Girls' School.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what is he going to do about the large\r\n\r\nnumbers of over-age students, especially those from\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas? The Minister assured us that they\r\n\r\nwere  going to secondary evening schools.  But  the\r\n\r\nrural  residents have to attend evening schools  in\r\n\r\ntown.  I  think it is quite difficult for  them  to\r\n\r\nattend  evening schools in town. Therefore, I  wish\r\n\r\nthe  Minister will find a solution for those  over-age  students who attend schools in the rural areas\r\n\r\nand  who  are denied the right to attend  secondary\r\n\r\nschools here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed\r\n\r\nsurprised  to  see that the hon.

Sir, the hon. Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\nhas  asked me several questions. I will answer them\r\n\r\none by one. Evening classes are meant for all those\r\n\r\nwho  have, either for one reason or another, failed\r\n\r\nto  get into the secondary section because they are\r\n\r\nover-age  or because they have failed the  entrance\r\n\r\nexamination to the secondary schools. There will be\r\n\r\nplaces  for all these people. There are, of course,\r\n\r\nexceptions.  I  will not make places available  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  already attending day  schools  or\r\n\r\nprivate  schools  and  wanting  to  attend  evening\r\n\r\nclasses  just  to brush up on their studies.  These\r\n\r\nevening  classes are the same as the  day  schools.\r\n\r\nThe  pupils  in these classes will be given,  as  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  stated  in this House many a time,  education\r\n\r\nleading  up  to the Senior Middle III  examination,\r\n\r\nthe   Royal   Society  of  Arts,  and  the   Senior\r\n\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also referred to the youth\r\n\r\nmovement  and  playing field facilities  not  being\r\n\r\nmade  use  of. I wish to inform him that  there  is\r\n\r\nalready  a  section  called  the  Youth  Recreation\r\n\r\nSection in the Ministry of Labour and Welfare under\r\n\r\na  Director  who has been seconded from the  United\r\n\r\nStates  of America. He is working in close  liaison\r\n\r\nwith my Ministry to see that all the playing fields\r\n\r\nare  being made use of and not being left idle; and\r\n\r\nhe  is to co-ordinate all youth activities in  this\r\n\r\nColony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Tamil education, I take this\r\n\r\nopportunity to inform the House that Government has\r\n\r\ntaken over two Tamil schools as Government schools.\r\n\r\nOne  is the St. George's Road Tamil School and  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  is  another Tamil school near  the  Hospital\r\n\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of giving better salaries to Tamil\r\n\r\nteachers with the requisite qualifications is  also\r\n\r\nbeing pursued vigorously, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand I think the Tamil teachers will  have\r\n\r\nno qualms about their salary scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of further Tamil education will be\r\n\r\nthe  subject of discussion by the Education Council\r\n\r\nwhich is being set up under the new education law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tiong Bahru insisted that we\r\n\r\nmust  have teachers at any cost. I hope he can,  by\r\n\r\nmagic, produce them out of a hat! Teachers must  be\r\n\r\ntrained  and it takes time to train them. To  staff\r\n\r\nthe   secondary  schools,  we  must  have  graduate\r\n\r\nteachers  and  it is difficult to get them  because\r\n\r\nthere  are other professions which they would  like\r\n\r\nto  join. The Ministry has been trying to make  the\r\n\r\nteaching  profession as attractive as possible  for\r\n\r\nUniversity  graduates, in  order  to  get  them  to\r\n\r\nbecome teachers or Education Officers. We have  not\r\n\r\nbeen very successful. Therefore, we just cannot say\r\n\r\nthe word and the teachers will be there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also deplored the provision for\r\n\r\nfree textbooks. He accused me of reducing the grant\r\n\r\nfor  free  textbooks  from $300,000  this  year  to\r\n\r\n$151,000 for 1959. I wish he had made some  efforts\r\n\r\nat  getting the facts. It is true in 1958  we  have\r\n\r\nprovided  a  sum of $300,000 but up  to  this  very\r\n\r\nday - in  fact, up to the end of the year - only  about\r\n\r\n$131,000 has been expended under that item. I think\r\n\r\nhon. Members of this House will appreciate that  we\r\n\r\nmust  have a realistic estimate. We cannot come  to\r\n\r\nthis  House  and ask for $500,000 just to  make  it\r\n\r\nimpressive when the expenditure will only be  about\r\n\r\n$100,000. Based on the experience of providing free\r\n\r\ntextbooks  for  1958, we have put  that  figure  at\r\n\r\n$151,000, which is more realistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also mentioned that pupils are\r\n\r\nbeing  thrown  out of classrooms  or  schools  just\r\n\r\nbecause  of free textbooks. I wish he could produce\r\n\r\nfacts  and  give  me evidence of  students  leaving\r\n\r\nschool just because they have no textbooks.  In  my\r\n\r\nthree  years  and  nine months' experience  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education, I have never come across one\r\n\r\nsingle case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also mentioned something about\r\n\r\nthe leakage of examination papers and that I should\r\n\r\nbe  responsible. I gave a statement to  this  House\r\n\r\nnot  so  long  ago  regarding the  leakage  in  the\r\n\r\nEnglish entrance examination. We know the source of\r\n\r\nthe leakage. I cannot certainly be held responsible\r\n\r\njust  because a man became dishonest. I  cannot  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the  workings  of  the  minds  of\r\n\r\npeople, much less the workings of the mind  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tiong Bahru!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also deplored the fact that children had been\r\n\r\nposted to schools far away from their homes.  Well,\r\n\r\nthis  system  of  placing children close  to  their\r\n\r\nhomes  was  instituted by me in 1955 or  1956.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry has been working under great pressure, and\r\n\r\nit  is  almost inevitable that there must  be  some\r\n\r\nchildren who will have to travel a bit further from\r\n\r\ntheir homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself, when I went to school, had to walk six\r\n\r\nmiles  through an estate road to go  to  school.  I\r\n\r\nnever  complained; neither did my parents complain.\r\n\r\nI think the public should not be pampered too much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  want  schools right at their door-step!  They\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  make an effort to go to school. For a  person\r\n\r\nliving in Tiong Bahru to go to Kim Seng Road,  less\r\n\r\nthan  half a mile away, I think that is a very lame\r\n\r\nexcuse indeed to make in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also mentioned that out of the\r\n\r\n15,000   children   who  sat   for   the   entrance\r\n\r\nexamination, about 7,000 would be able to get  into\r\n\r\nthe secondary section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I made a public statement through the\r\n\r\nPress that anyone who passed that examination would\r\n\r\nbe given a place in the secondary section and those\r\n\r\nwho  failed  would be given a place in the  evening\r\n\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that leads me to the question of secondary\r\n\r\neducation, a subject on which the Member for  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru  laboured for a long time. I  think  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  we  are putting secondary education  on  a\r\n\r\nbasis  which  far exceeds that of other  countries.\r\n\r\nEven in very advanced countries like the United\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKingdom, the percentage is only about 25 to 27  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  the  primary  section  going  up  to  the\r\n\r\nsecondary  section.  Now in  this  country  we  are\r\n\r\npromoting about 46 to 50 per cent of them. The crux\r\n\r\nof  the  matter  is - can  we  afford  it?  When  the\r\n\r\nGovernment raise taxes, people shout at us. We have\r\n\r\ncriticisms  from the Opposition. Now what  is  that\r\n\r\nmoney  for?  The money is for providing  education.\r\n\r\nYet, in view of the financial stringency, we cannot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafford  to  give  everyone  a  secondary  education\r\n\r\nmerely  because  he needs it, he wants  it,  or  he\r\n\r\ndemands  it.  The Education Ministry is responsible\r\n\r\nfor  seeing that those who can benefit by  it  will\r\n\r\nget it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Changi touched on the question\r\n\r\nof  a Pan-Malayan education policy, Malay being the\r\n\r\nlingua  franca.  I cannot voice my policy  here  in\r\n\r\nthat  regard.  I have been faithfully carrying  out\r\n\r\nthe recommendations made by the All-Party Committee\r\n\r\non  Education  of which I was the Chairman  and  of\r\n\r\nwhich the hon. Member for Changi was a member. If I\r\n\r\nhad  not faithfully carried them out, I would  have\r\n\r\nheard murmurs of protest. But not one murmur have I\r\n\r\nheard from any member of that Committee saying that\r\n\r\nI  had  failed  in  my duty in carrying  out  those\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  Everyone of  the  recommendations\r\n\r\nhas been implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of Malay being the lingua\r\n\r\nfranca,  I  think that is a political matter  which\r\n\r\nmust  be  decided by the political parties  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming  elections. I am not competent to  formulate\r\n\r\nmy own policy on that matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the vernacular classes being carried on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the English schools, the hon. Member for Changi\r\n\r\nasked whether there was any progress. I told him, I\r\n\r\nthink, in this House and in private, that there  is\r\n\r\nprogress.  The teaching of vernacular languages  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  schools is made compulsory, and the  marks\r\n\r\nobtained  in this examination count in the  record,\r\n\r\nand  every  child  has been made to  take  his  own\r\n\r\nvernacular language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.15 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the vacant places in Chung Cheng and\r\n\r\nChung Hwa Schools, about which the hon.

No.\r\n\r\nOver-age pupils can get, as I say, into the evening\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclasses  for which they are meant, and I  will  not\r\n\r\nopen  them merely because there may be a few  over-age  pupils who want to study in those schools. The\r\n\r\nover-age  pupils can get into the evening  classes,\r\n\r\nincluding those over-age pupils in the rural  areas\r\n\r\nto  which  the hon. Member referred.  If  the  need\r\n\r\narises,  I  will open evening classes in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  to  suit  the convenience of those  over-age\r\n\r\npupils. I think those are the points that I have to\r\n\r\nanswer, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R.

Minister has just said that\r\n\r\nin  the  United States only 26 per cent  are  able,\r\n\r\nafter passing the primary school examination, to go\r\n\r\nto secondary schools, if I heard him correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The United Kingdom!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Then in Singapore almost 50 per cent\r\n\r\nof  the primary school students are able to  go  to\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools. When I quoted my  figures,  the\r\n\r\nMinister did not contradict them. My figures are - in\r\n\r\nEnglish  schools  we  have  145,000  children;   in\r\n\r\nChinese  schools 135,000 children; in Malay schools\r\n\r\n15,000   children  and  in  Indian  schools   2,000\r\n\r\nchildren.  There are approximately 300,000  school-going  children.  Out of this number,  we  have  in\r\n\r\nprimary  schools 250,000 children, taking it  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole,   and  in  secondary  schools  only   42,000\r\n\r\nchildren. That is the 1957 record. In the technical\r\n\r\nschools  there are only 2,000 children and  in  the\r\n\r\nuniversities  there  are 3,000 children.  So,  from\r\n\r\namong  the 250,000 children in the primary schools,\r\n\r\nonly   42,000  children  are  going  to   secondary\r\n\r\nschools.  How  does  the  Minister  reconcile   his\r\n\r\nstatement  that  50 per cent of  the  children  are\r\n\r\nbeing given facilities to go to secondary schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The hon.

Each  year we  take  in  about  20,000\r\n\r\nchildren. The children take six years to reach  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  VI stage where they will have to take  the\r\n\r\nentrance examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that 46 to 50 per cent of the children\r\n\r\nwho  gain  admission to the secondary  section  are\r\n\r\nthose  who have sat for the examination. That means\r\n\r\nnot all the 300,000 sit for the examination surely,\r\n\r\nbut  those  who  sit  for the examination  are  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  VI  classes.  The  hon.

I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  the Chinese Section of the Ministry has  been\r\n\r\nabolished   entirely   and   absorbed   into    the\r\n\r\nadministration. As a result, there have  been  many\r\n\r\ncomplaints   of   inconvenience   raised   in   the\r\n\r\neditorials of the daily newspapers and also in  the\r\n\r\ncolumn   \"Man-in-the-Street\".

Only the Chinese Section knew\r\n\r\neverything  about the Chinese section, and  matters\r\n\r\nnever  went further than that section. Now,  it  is\r\n\r\nbeing  streamlined  and administrative  duties  are\r\n\r\nbeing  separated from professional duties.

We have Chinese\r\n\r\nofficers  who speak Mandarin and other dialects  in\r\n\r\nthe  various Sections. For instance, in  the  Staff\r\n\r\nSection,  we  have a Chinese Inspector  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools helping the Staff Officer to interview  all\r\n\r\nthe Chinese school principals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Professional Section, there are also\r\n\r\nofficers who know the Chinese language dealing with\r\n\r\nprofessional  matters. So the  complaint  that  the\r\n\r\nChinese school principals do not know where  to  go\r\n\r\nto  is  sheer  utter nonsense, uttered without  any\r\n\r\nresponsibility at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irregularity of files missing is another bit\r\n\r\nof sheer nonsense.

I would suggest that  the\r\n\r\nincoming Government should formulate a policy  that\r\n\r\nat  least  one member of a family should have  some\r\n\r\nsort  of  employment. If that is done, the cost  of\r\n\r\ngiving  support from the revenue to the  unemployed\r\n\r\nwill be greatly reduced.

It  is\r\n\r\nvery  sad for me, Sir, to have to inform those  who\r\n\r\ncome to seek my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naid  to get a Singapore Improvement Trust house for\r\n\r\nthem,  that unless they were registered a few years\r\n\r\nago their hope of ever getting one for the next ten\r\n\r\nyears is exactly nil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this situation is aggravated by the private\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  having come to a  grinding  halt:\r\n\r\nfirstly,  because  they are now  unable  to  obtain\r\n\r\nloans   from  building  societies;  and,  secondly,\r\n\r\nbecause  the City Council has suddenly changed  its\r\n\r\npolicy  by  demanding payment for  electricity  and\r\n\r\nwater mains leading to the estate. These charges up\r\n\r\nto  a  few months ago were paid by the City Council\r\n\r\nbased  on  a consumption rate of a period  of  five\r\n\r\nyears.  Now, developers are asked to pay for public\r\n\r\nmains  leading from the last section  on  the  main\r\n\r\nroad  to the estate - and it may be half a mile.  To\r\n\r\ndo  this for an estate of just over 100 houses  may\r\n\r\ncost  $150,000, and this money must be paid to  the\r\n\r\nCity Council before the water and electricity mains\r\n\r\nare  laid  and taken up to the boundaries  of  that\r\n\r\nestate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, housing, next to employment, is the most\r\n\r\nimportant  need in Singapore today  and  we  cannot\r\n\r\npossibly sit tight and do nothing about it.  To  my\r\n\r\nmind,  there  is one solution to that problem,  and\r\n\r\nthat is by studying the growth and position of  the\r\n\r\nillegal houses that have sprung up during the  past\r\n\r\nthree years. These houses are built with plank  and\r\n\r\nzinc  out of the poorest material - in many cases  of\r\n\r\nwaste timber, and the zinc is of the thinnest gauge\r\n\r\nand  will rust and leak within two to three  years.\r\n\r\nIt  is  no use closing our eyes to the defiance  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe law by people who have just gone right ahead to\r\n\r\nbuild  these  houses, and exploit  the  unfortunate\r\n\r\npeople who are short of housing, without submitting\r\n\r\nplans,  without trying to subdivide  the  land  and\r\n\r\nprovide proper drainage or roads. They just  go  on\r\n\r\nto  the  land and build. There are now today  about\r\n\r\n9,000  to  10,000  of  such  houses  and  they  are\r\n\r\ninhabited  by people who have paid from  $3,000  to\r\n\r\n$8,000  per  house,  the price depending  upon  the\r\n\r\ndistance  from the main road. In addition  to  this\r\n\r\ncash payment, they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  to sign leases of 20 to 30 years, under which\r\n\r\nthey have to pay to the owner of the land or to the\r\n\r\nlessee (the developer) $10 or $15 per month, and at\r\n\r\nthe  end of the period they will have to vacate the\r\n\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have studied the position carefully because\r\n\r\nmany  people  have come to ask me to  try  and  get\r\n\r\nthese  houses approved by the City Council  or  the\r\n\r\nRural  Board.  I  have spent much  time  going  and\r\n\r\nseeing these houses and interviewing the people who\r\n\r\nhave  bought  them.  From my own investigations,  I\r\n\r\nhave found that the illegal speculator has made  at\r\n\r\nleast $2,000 per house, and taking an average, say,\r\n\r\nof  $2,000 per house on 10,000 houses, these people\r\n\r\nhave  cleared a fortune of $20 million. No  wonder,\r\n\r\nSir,  this racket is now spreading like wild  fire,\r\n\r\nand  hundreds  of such houses are  going  up  every\r\n\r\nweek. No one can be so blind as not to notice  them\r\n\r\non  the roadside in the course of construction, row\r\n\r\nafter row and street after street. If you will only\r\n\r\ntake  the trouble to look behind these houses,  you\r\n\r\nwill  see  rows  and  rows  going  right  into  the\r\n\r\nhinterland. What better business can you have  than\r\n\r\nthis one? It is better than running a gambling farm\r\n\r\nor even smuggling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the dreadful part of it is this. When these\r\n\r\noperators run out of land, which they have obtained\r\n\r\nwith  the consent of the owners, they simply go  on\r\n\r\nto any vacant land and build without the permission\r\n\r\nof the owners. We know two or three cases where the\r\n\r\nowners  protested; they took action, and  a  murder\r\n\r\nwas  attempted. These operators protect  themselves\r\n\r\nby  making purchasers sign receipts that the houses\r\n\r\nhave been built by the purchaser at his request. To\r\n\r\nmy  astonishment,  there are many  people  who  are\r\n\r\nwilling to pay for such flimsy houses which require\r\n\r\nconstant  repair,  without  light  or  water,   and\r\n\r\nsometimes  no drainage, and they are liable  to  be\r\n\r\npulled down over their ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine the legal aspect as I see it. The\r\n\r\nowner of the land and the speculator have committed\r\n\r\nthree offences under the law. First, by subdividing\r\n\r\nthe  land  without  the approval of  the  Competent\r\n\r\nAuthority; secondly, by granting a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlease  of more than seven years without subdividing\r\n\r\nthe  land; and thirdly, by building houses  without\r\n\r\napproved  plans.  For each of these  offences,  the\r\n\r\nbuilder  is  liable to a fine of $1,000,  and/or  a\r\n\r\nfine  of  $50 a day for a continuing offence  until\r\n\r\nthe  houses are demolished. Sir, this is  indeed  a\r\n\r\nsevere  punishment and I understand some owners  of\r\n\r\nthe  land  and  some speculators have already  been\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Courts, but this is  not  all.  In  my\r\n\r\nhumble opinion, there is no legal liability for any\r\n\r\nof  the occupiers or tenants of such illegal houses\r\n\r\nto  pay the $10 or $15 rent under the lease, for it\r\n\r\nis  a fundamental principle of law that anyone  who\r\n\r\ncomes  to Court for justice must have clean  hands,\r\n\r\nand  I cannot see any Court granting judgment or  a\r\n\r\nwrit  of distress to people on contracts which  are\r\n\r\nbased  on  such  breaches of  the  law.  The  legal\r\n\r\nposition is that if such tenants, who have  already\r\n\r\nbeen  extorted  to  the tune of $2,000  to  $5,000,\r\n\r\nrefuse to pay any further for the right to stay  in\r\n\r\ntheir houses, they cannot be brought to Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must now face the situation squarely. Are\r\n\r\nwe  to  punish  those people who have  parted  with\r\n\r\ntheir savings because they were so desperate for  a\r\n\r\nhouse that they have had to pay for something which\r\n\r\nthey  knew  to be of no value, taking the  risk  of\r\n\r\nbeing  prosecuted in Court and having their  houses\r\n\r\ndemolished? Are we not in part to blame for it?  If\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Improvement Trust had not broken down\r\n\r\nin  its  programme in 1955 and 1956, many of  these\r\n\r\npeople would have got a roof over their heads. What\r\n\r\nhave  we done to discourage the unscrupulous people\r\n\r\nfrom  flouting the law? Clearly, Sir, no government\r\n\r\nin  power and none of us in this House can have the\r\n\r\nheart  to  see  10,000  families  thrown  into  the\r\n\r\nstreets. It is a situation which we must accept but\r\n\r\nwhich   must   not   be   aggravated   under    any\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  The situation is like  a  reservoir\r\n\r\nthat  has  burst  its  darn. There  is  no  way  of\r\n\r\nstopping  the  raging torrent. We can only  control\r\n\r\nits  course or contain it by letting the flood  run\r\n\r\ninto proper sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore make the following suggestions. First,\r\n\r\naccept  illegal  houses which were constructed  and\r\n\r\ninhabited prior to the 31st of December, 1958.  All\r\n\r\nsuch houses, except those which have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilt  against the wishes of the owner of the land,\r\n\r\nshould   be   given  temporary  permits.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nencourage  and  approve  with  all  possible  speed\r\n\r\nschemes   of  private  building  estates  for   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  low-cost houses  for  sale  under\r\n\r\n$6,000. Thirdly, use all the land that is earmarked\r\n\r\nfor  satellite  towns  in the areas  of  Woodlands,\r\n\r\nSembawang  and  Jurong for subdivision  into  small\r\n\r\nlots,  and sell it to the people who will  then  be\r\n\r\nable  to  build  their  own  houses  according   to\r\n\r\napproved  plans.  Fourthly, take drastic  steps  to\r\n\r\nprevent  any  further attemps to build  after  this\r\n\r\nyear by imposing maximum fines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, punishment is not enough. Such illegal\r\n\r\ndevelopment must be contained, and it can  be  done\r\n\r\nif   the  Government  acquire  land  around   these\r\n\r\nsettlements  and then proceed to cut up  this  land\r\n\r\ninto  small  lots  after providing  drains,  roads,\r\n\r\nlight and water. These lots can then be sold to the\r\n\r\npeople  who will have houses to live in.  By  doing\r\n\r\nthis,  you will have stopped the extension of these\r\n\r\nillegal  houses and will have saved private  owners\r\n\r\nfrom  the  headache  of putting watchmen  on  their\r\n\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.45 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reaction to my proposal will be that it\r\n\r\ninfringes upon the Master Plan, but this is not so.\r\n\r\nIt  is  provided for under the Report of  the  Land\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClearance and Resettlement Working Party issued  as\r\n\r\nSessional Paper No. Cmd. 27 of 1956. At page 13,  I\r\n\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is emphasised that considerable reliance is\r\n\r\nplaced in the Master Plan on the continued erection\r\n\r\nof  temporary dwellings on `tolerated' sites in the\r\n\r\nUrban  Area and on rural resettlement in the  Rural\r\n\r\nArea.  They make a significant contribution to  the\r\n\r\noverall   housing   problem,  and   the   estimated\r\n\r\nrequirement of 10,000 permanent houses a year to be\r\n\r\nbuilt to solve the housing problem over the next 20\r\n\r\nyears,  which  is a basic assumption of  the  Plan,\r\n\r\nwould have to be revised if this contribution  were\r\n\r\nnot made.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There  is  under this paragraph a table giving  the\r\n\r\nnames  of  16 kampongs where such houses  could  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  together  with  areas  and  the  numbers  of\r\n\r\nfamilies  which can be housed. I do not propose  to\r\n\r\nread the figures, but I would like hon.

It has taken me, in some cases,\r\n\r\nnearly  two  years to have plans approved  for  100\r\n\r\nhouses, and at that rate, for 10,000 houses it will\r\n\r\ntake an eternity. Therefore, who can blame them for\r\n\r\nbuilding before the plans are approved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why should we then not decide to accept the\r\n\r\nhouses  already built, but from now to decide  that\r\n\r\nanyone who chooses to try and build houses for  the\r\n\r\npublic must conform with the law and provide houses\r\n\r\nat  a  reasonable price and not at an  extortionate\r\n\r\nprice?  The  time  is now ripe because  I  consider\r\n\r\nillegal  houses  have reached a  saturation  point.\r\n\r\nSome  builders are finding difficulty in  disposing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof hastily built houses. Buyers are more selective.\r\n\r\nNow  is the time to move in and build a dam so that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  torrent which has now subsided should  not  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to run wild again. Let us give  notice  to\r\n\r\nintending breakers of the law that after the end of\r\n\r\nthis  year we shall no longer tolerate any  further\r\n\r\naction  to build without plans being approved.  Are\r\n\r\nwe  so  blind that we cannot make use of the  clear\r\n\r\nindication given by these 10,000 houses? They  show\r\n\r\nthat people will help themselves if Government will\r\n\r\nnot,  that they do not have to be pampered and live\r\n\r\nin ten-storey flats with modern facilities; that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Government do not have to spend $60 million  on\r\n\r\nSingapore  Improvement  Trust  houses,  and   after\r\n\r\nhaving spent $60 million, to have to subsidise half\r\n\r\nthe  rent again, thereby running into many millions\r\n\r\nmore. They show that the people are prepared to pay\r\n\r\nthousands  of  dollars for a  shack,  maintain  and\r\n\r\nrepair  it,  and live for years without  light  and\r\n\r\nwater   and  even  drainage.  All  they   want   is\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  provide the land,  subdividing  and\r\n\r\nselling it to them in small lots, and they will  do\r\n\r\nthe  rest. By using a revolving fund of $1 million,\r\n\r\nGovernment will not have to spend a single cent  to\r\n\r\nenable  another 10,000 houses to be built by people\r\n\r\nwho  are  only  too  anxious and  waiting  to  help\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Sir,  this $1 million  can  easily  be\r\n\r\nraised by selling some of the Singapore Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust flats to the people who live in them and  who\r\n\r\ncan  well afford to pay. I believe there is a block\r\n\r\nbuilt  for the particular purpose of being sold  to\r\n\r\ntenants. I think it was at Dawson Road. Surely that\r\n\r\nblock should be sold to provide the money for  this\r\n\r\nscheme.  This  is not the first time  that  I  have\r\n\r\nbrought  to the attention of this House  this  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  position. It has caused me  considerable\r\n\r\nworry.  I have spent much time and trouble studying\r\n\r\nthe  whole position and I think I have presented  a\r\n\r\ncase  to  this House which is reasonable and  which\r\n\r\ncan be accepted by all Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, \"That the sum to\r\n\r\nbe  allotted  for Head D 22 be reduced  by  $10  in\r\n\r\nrespect of subhead 1 therein.\" The hon.

Since I  was\r\n\r\nelected a representative of the people in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1950  to this very day, the main work that  I  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  do for the people of Singapore, especially\r\n\r\nin  my  ward,  is to get housing accommodation  for\r\n\r\nthem.  I  have  been  a constant  nuisance  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Improvement   Trust,   visiting    them\r\n\r\npractically every week and trying to find  out  for\r\n\r\nthose  who have applied for accommodation  for  the\r\n\r\nlast  three or four years, whether they  could  get\r\n\r\nit,  and the answer that I receive week in and week\r\n\r\nout  is practically the same, \"Be patient, and  you\r\n\r\nmight  hear  some favourable results  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Singapore Improvement Trust has not\r\n\r\nbeen successful in tackling the housing problem. As\r\n\r\nhas  been said by the Member for Paya Lebar, we now\r\n\r\nsee  a  lot of illegal houses being built, in spite\r\n\r\nof  the fact that the people who buy them and  live\r\n\r\nin  them know very well that there is no likelihood\r\n\r\nof  staying  in them permanently. This  shows  very\r\n\r\nclearly  that there is a pressing need for housing.\r\n\r\nI am just wondering why, apart from the suggestions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nput  up  by the Member for Paya Lebar - that  is,  to\r\n\r\nlegalise  these  illegal  buildings;  to  encourage\r\n\r\nprivate enterprise to build low-cost housing of not\r\n\r\nmore  than  $6,000; and to sell some of the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nhouses - Government  has not also considered  raising\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nloans from the public. Is it because Government  is\r\n\r\nafraid  that if a loan were to be raised, it  would\r\n\r\nreceive  the  same  response as  the  City  Council\r\n\r\nreceived   some  time  back,  Sir?  Personally,   I\r\n\r\nmaintain  that in spite of the criticisms  made  by\r\n\r\nMembers   of  the  Opposition,  this  is   a   good\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  it has got the confidence  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. I believe that if a loan were to be raised,\r\n\r\nit   would  be  fully  subscribed,  if  not   over-subscribed.  The  people of  Singapore,  especially\r\n\r\nthose  in responsible positions, have a high  sense\r\n\r\nof duty and any stable Government's project to help\r\n\r\nthe  lower income group in a big way will have  the\r\n\r\nsupport of these people because, if they have made\r\n\r\ntheir money in Singapore, I am quite sure they will\r\n\r\nconsider  it  their  duty to  help  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that the Government, which is asking\r\n\r\nfor  $7 million, will not stop at that but that  it\r\n\r\nwill find ways\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  means of providing more houses for the  people\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nlooking  at  Head D22, I am surprised  at  the  low\r\n\r\nfigure that is earmarked for housing for next year.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Estimates, the amount approved for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe three schemes totals over $91 million. In 1957,\r\n\r\n$30 million was paid out; this year, $21 million is\r\n\r\nto  be paid out; but for next year the amount to be\r\n\r\npaid  out is only estimated at $7 million. I cannot\r\n\r\nsee  why  this  figure should be reduced  from  $30\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1957 to $21 million this year and  then\r\n\r\nto  $7 million for next year. It appears to me that\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T. is not pushing ahead with its  housing\r\n\r\nschemes  and  that it is rather backward  with  its\r\n\r\nhousing schemes. To combat this, I am glad that the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  made  an  announcement  in   today's\r\n\r\nSingapore  Standard that the Government will  build\r\n\r\nlow-cost  houses.  I quote from  today's  Singapore\r\n\r\nStandard:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore Government will early next year sell\r\n\r\n100  low-cost houses to Malays whose monthly income\r\n\r\nis below $400.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.00 noon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very good news indeed because this will\r\n\r\nhelp quite a number of people, who have applied for\r\n\r\nS.I.T. houses,  to be housed under  this  low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing scheme. But I am disappointed that this low-cost housing is only for the benefit of the Malays.\r\n\r\nI  would prefer that the Government, in introducing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  scheme,  looks  after the  interests  of  all\r\n\r\ncommunities rather than only one community, because\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is responsible  to  the  whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and not to just one particular community.\r\n\r\nAs  I say, if this scheme is open for allotment  to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neverybody  then  everybody will have  a  chance  to\r\n\r\napply for these houses at low cost. At the moment I\r\n\r\nam  told  that  there are more than 14,000  on  the\r\n\r\nwaiting list for houses. How is the S.I.T. going to\r\n\r\nhouse  all  these 14,000, when only $7  million  is\r\n\r\nearmarked for next year? This is really too slow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.I.T. has been attacked on many occasions for\r\n\r\nits  allocation  system. A  special  committee  was\r\n\r\nrecently  set up to call for suggestions  from  the\r\n\r\npublic, Assemblymen and City Councillors, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  other organizations and political Parties.  It\r\n\r\nis  very disappointing to note that only 21 sent in\r\n\r\nsuggestions for allocation of houses. If there  are\r\n\r\ncriticisms  against the S.I.T., it is the  duty  of\r\n\r\nthe    critics   to   send   in   suggestions   for\r\n\r\nconsideration. I cannot understand why  the  public\r\n\r\nor  political  organisations are not interested  in\r\n\r\nmaking any suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only hope that, with the introduction of\r\n\r\nthis new scheme, it will beat the racket of illegal\r\n\r\nhouses, as quoted by the Member for Paya Lebar.  It\r\n\r\nis  a known fact that illegal houses have sprung up\r\n\r\neverywhere - in the Amber Road area, in  the  Bartley\r\n\r\nRoad  area, and many other places. Cases have  gone\r\n\r\nto  Court,  as  quoted in the papers recently,  and\r\n\r\ncertainly  I agree with the Member for  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nthat it is not the occupants who break the law, but\r\n\r\nthe racketeers. Unfortunately, the law is such that\r\n\r\nalthough  the  buildings  of  the  racketeers   are\r\n\r\nconsidered  to be illegal, the landowner,  ignorant\r\n\r\nof  the  law,  is  also brought to Court.  This  is\r\n\r\nreally   unfair.   When  the   City   Council   was\r\n\r\nconsidering  the question of housing in  the  attap\r\n\r\nareas, which was reported in the newspapers, a  few\r\n\r\nracketeers  get  themselves together  and  started\r\n\r\nbuilding  houses either on their  own  land  or  on\r\n\r\nother  people's land. As quoted by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar,  these  unscrupulous  racketeers  take\r\n\r\nadvantage by selling these illegally erected houses\r\n\r\nto  people who are looking for houses and  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to move in, not knowing that  the  houses\r\n\r\nare  illegal.  And when these people apply  to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil   for   assessment  after  a  few   months'\r\n\r\noccupation,  they  realise that  these  houses  are\r\n\r\nillegal, and the poor tenants are thus victimised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot see why the Government should not stamp\r\n\r\nit  out  now.  As the Member for Paya  Lebar  said,\r\n\r\n\"This  is now the time to step in and stop  further\r\n\r\nillegal   houses.\"   He  has  put   forward   three\r\n\r\nsuggestions one of which is: accept illegal  houses\r\n\r\nwhich were constructed and inhabited prior to  31st\r\n\r\nDecember, 1958. All such houses, except those which\r\n\r\nhave been built against the wishes of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  owner  of the land, are to be given  temporary\r\n\r\npermits.  I fully agree with him, but not with  the\r\n\r\ndate, because there are about 12 to 13 days between\r\n\r\nnow  and  31st December, and when this debate  gets\r\n\r\ninto  the papers after today's sitting, and if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment really considers this scheme acceptable,\r\n\r\nI am afraid the operators will again start building\r\n\r\nillegal  houses within this short period.  We  have\r\n\r\nknown that such houses can be built within a day or\r\n\r\ntwo or overnight, as in the case of Amber Road.  So\r\n\r\nwithin  these  12 days if about 100 houses  can  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  overnight, we will find another few thousand\r\n\r\nhouses  springing up within this short  period.  We\r\n\r\nshould  take  action against those who build  after\r\n\r\ntoday, and that is quite fair. We have relaxed  the\r\n\r\nlaw so much that such operations have been going on\r\n\r\nand  on, and I think the Government should stop  it\r\n\r\nas from today. Only then are we able to protect the\r\n\r\noccupants  of  such  illegal houses.  They  had  to\r\n\r\nborrow money to buy them and, after having borrowed\r\n\r\nmoney  to  pay for them, they find that the  houses\r\n\r\nand  the  land do not belong to them, nor can  they\r\n\r\nstay  in  the houses. If the Government  is  really\r\n\r\naccepting  this scheme, I hope it will not  be  the\r\n\r\n31st  of December, 1958, but it will be from today,\r\n\r\nand  drastic  action should be taken against  those\r\n\r\nwho build houses as from today onwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar said that a fine is not\r\n\r\nsufficient. I agree. What is the use of imposing  a\r\n\r\nfine  on  a  man who puts up a house illegally  and\r\n\r\nbenefited  by  it by a few thousand dollars?  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  fine,  the house should  be  demolished.\r\n\r\nConcrete action should be taken, not on paper only,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  mere words. If a demolition order is issued  by\r\n\r\nthe Court, action should immediately follow and the\r\n\r\nhouse  pulled down. But for those who have  already\r\n\r\nreceived demolition orders, as quoted by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Paya Lebar, I hope the Government will try  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  something so that  the  Court  could  be\r\n\r\ngiven  the  powers  to  withdraw  those  demolition\r\n\r\norders and that they be given assessment, or  given\r\n\r\nthe authority to stay. This requires\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  amendment  to  the law, and  I  do  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will consider taking quick action to  do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Housing made a statement to the Singapore Standard, which I now quote from that\r\n\r\npaper of today's date:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"He said that as far as the Malays were concerned,\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust houses are a failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of them, he said, could not afford to\r\n\r\npay the rent for S.I.T. houses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But  where I am concerned, I think the S.I.T. is  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  and a total failure. It is not only  the\r\n\r\nMalays  who consider the S.I.T. a failure, but  all\r\n\r\nthe   communities  in  Singapore - the  Chinese,  the\r\n\r\nMalays,  the  Indians,  everyone  who  requires   a\r\n\r\nhouse - consider the S.I.T. is a complete failure. So\r\n\r\nthe  sooner the Housing Authority comes into being,\r\n\r\nthe better it is for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Mr Tan Theng Chiang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  have listened to the hon. Member for  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar's views with great interest, because they are\r\n\r\nof considerable merit and because my Ministry is in\r\n\r\nfact  already working along lines similar to  those\r\n\r\nhe  has  outlined. As my Ministry is in  charge  of\r\n\r\nhousing,  Sir, I am still convinced that  the  best\r\n\r\npolicy  for Government in the long run will  be  to\r\n\r\nprovide  permanent housing, as the  saving  in  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  repairs  and maintenance will  eventually\r\n\r\noffset the additional expense of erecting permanent\r\n\r\nbuildings  and  as in \"land-short\"  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nmaximum ultilization of land is desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in view of the present economic\r\n\r\nsituation, limiting the number of permanent  houses\r\n\r\nwhich  can be built, and on the other hand,  taking\r\n\r\ninto  account  the alarming number of  unauthorised\r\n\r\ntemporary houses that have sprung up, it has become\r\n\r\nclear  that a fresh approach to the problem has  to\r\n\r\nbe  made. Our main problem, therefore, is  how  the\r\n\r\npresent  monies  allocated  for  housing  can  most\r\n\r\nprofitably be used for permanent housing needs,  as\r\n\r\nwell as take account of this emergency situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  present policies my Ministry is following  and\r\n\r\nthe  new  approaches being explored to  solve  this\r\n\r\nproblem are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squatters on land required for permanent\r\n\r\ndevelopment    are   either   offered    S.I.T. accommodation  or,  alternatively,   they   are\r\n\r\noffered  a plot of land and a temporary  house.\r\n\r\nOne  of  the  hon.

I  have  read the Budget  and  the  Budget\r\n\r\nspeech.   I   realise  the  difficulties   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the difficulty of geting more  revenue\r\n\r\nand  the  difficulty of meeting more urgent  needs,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  education, medical and other necessities.\r\n\r\nIf we cannot allot more money to housing, that does\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  mean that we can just forget about it. We must\r\n\r\nstart  finding some remedy to improve the situation\r\n\r\nwhere  practicable.  When we mention  housing,  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore automatically  think  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore    Improvement   Trust.   The   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust has two duties to perform - one  is\r\n\r\nhousing and the other is planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen the Singapore Standard this morning,\r\n\r\nwhere the Minister for Local Government, Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing  was  quoted  as saying  that,  as  far  as\r\n\r\nhousing  for the Malays is concerned, the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust is a failure. I would like to  go\r\n\r\nfurther  than that. As far as housing in  Singapore\r\n\r\nis concerned, the Singapore Improvement Trust is a,\r\n\r\nfailure.  When I say that, Sir, I do not mean  that\r\n\r\nthe houses being put up are bad. What they have put\r\n\r\nup is, I think, as good as is expected of them. But\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Improvement Trust is  not  the  only\r\n\r\nbody  which  can  carry out housing development  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Other countries which do  not  have  an\r\n\r\norganisation  like the Singapore Improvement  Trust\r\n\r\nmanage  to solve their housing problem. The private\r\n\r\nindividuals  of  Singapore  have  also  contributed\r\n\r\ntowards  solving the housing problem. If I remember\r\n\r\ncorrectly, Sir, I think the number of buildings put\r\n\r\nup  by private individuals is more or less what the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust has built in all  these\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach of the Singapore Improvement Trust\r\n\r\nto the housing problem is entirely wrong. It thinks\r\n\r\nof  ideals. If we can, we all like to have  ideals.\r\n\r\nBut  if we cannot, let us be practical. Housing  is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  of the three primary necessities of life.  The\r\n\r\nother two are, of course, clothing and food.  If  a\r\n\r\nperson cannot find a nice flat in which to stay, he\r\n\r\nought  to  be satisfied with a room. If  he  cannot\r\n\r\neven  get a room, then he should be satisfied with,\r\n\r\nsay,  a shack or a portion of a shack. If he cannot\r\n\r\nget even that, then he should be prepared to accept\r\n\r\neven a shed, whether there is any enclosure or not.\r\n\r\nOn that question, I think the Singapore Improvement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrust's policy as regards housing is a failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this island, Sir, there are hundreds and\r\n\r\nthousands  of  attap  huts. I do  not  think  these\r\n\r\npeople  would like to stay in them. On the question\r\n\r\nof attap houses, Singapore is not the only example.\r\n\r\nAll  over  Malaya, in fact, most countries  of  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworld  have  this  problem.  I  do  not  think  any\r\n\r\ncountry, however fortunate it may be, can say there\r\n\r\nare  enough houses for its people. I have mentioned\r\n\r\nthe  example of housing in Hongkong some months ago\r\n\r\nin  this House. I was told by the Minister that  is\r\n\r\nnot  good for Singapore. I have personally examined\r\n\r\nthose  buildings,  and I have also  examined  those\r\n\r\nshacks  built by them before they vacated to  these\r\n\r\napartments,  with  some of  the  Ministers  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation. I do agree that living in one room in a\r\n\r\nblock  of  flats with five or six storeys  with  no\r\n\r\nelevators,  is  not  ideal  for  anyone,   and   if\r\n\r\npossible,  we should never do it. But necessity  is\r\n\r\nreally  important  in this matter.  If  you  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  let  them have bigger flats,  with  one\r\n\r\nbedroom,  one  sitting  room,  or  even  when   the\r\n\r\nbathroom and W.C. are attached, then they should at\r\n\r\nleast have a room where they can be protected  from\r\n\r\nthe  weather.  That is the reason why the  Hongkong\r\n\r\nGovernment  put up those flats. That is the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy the housing officers in Hongkong told me to  do\r\n\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there are 15,000 people on the waiting list\r\n\r\nfor  houses,  and there is no chance  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture that they all could be satisfied. So,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  try to find some other solution that can ease\r\n\r\nthis  housing  shortage. I think I can  safely  say\r\n\r\nthat  I have been studying the housing problem  for\r\n\r\nthe last twenty years. Whenever I visit any foreign\r\n\r\ncountries,  whether  in the East  or  the  West  or\r\n\r\nanywhere  else, my primary concern has always  been\r\n\r\nhousing.  Although I am an architect, I  take  more\r\n\r\ninterest in trying to solve the problem of the poor\r\n\r\nman,  by trying to find out how we can provide  him\r\n\r\nwith  the maximum shelter which he can afford, than\r\n\r\nthe problem of how to make the millionaires' houses\r\n\r\nmore beautiful. The millionaire's house may be less\r\n\r\nbeautiful  but he will not suffer as  much  as  the\r\n\r\npoor man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in this respect, the question of housing the\r\n\r\npoor   is  always  close  to  my  heart.  From   my\r\n\r\nexperience for the last twenty years, it  seems  to\r\n\r\nme  that  the officers of the Singapore Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust  who  are responsible for planning  are  more\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  how  to make the  gardens  of  the\r\n\r\nmillionaires beautiful, rather than how to meet the\r\n\r\nnecessities  of  the poor man. They possibly  think\r\n\r\nthat  the  sweat of the poor man could  contaminate\r\n\r\nthe air which the millionaire breathes, and as they\r\n\r\nare  there to protect the millionaires and not  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, they must turn down  whatever\r\n\r\nreasonable  schemes are submitted  by  the  people.\r\n\r\nThey  are not the officers of the people. They  are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  to protect vested interests! They are  there\r\n\r\nto  protect  the  millionaires' gardens!  They  are\r\n\r\nthere  to protect the investors! Even today, having\r\n\r\na  small house or a semi-detached house next  to  a\r\n\r\nbungalow is considered a disgrace to them. It would\r\n\r\nautomatically   bring  down  the  value   of   that\r\n\r\ndistrict. Such is the type of officers we  have  in\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Improvement Trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say, Sir, that personally they have done me\r\n\r\nno wrong. But I am not here to speak for myself.  I\r\n\r\nam  here to speak for the people, and as far as the\r\n\r\npeople  are concerned, all these officers  can  go.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out their duties, they may think,  \"I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  created a few ideal towns. I have a few ideal\r\n\r\nplanning schemes.\" They might even get some  medals\r\n\r\nfrom the Town Planning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstitute. But I can assure the officers  concerned\r\n\r\nthat  these medals which they may have are  stained\r\n\r\nwith  the  blood of the people of Singapore.  Their\r\n\r\nchildren  would be only too pleased to get  rid  of\r\n\r\nthem  as a reminder of their forefathers' crime  to\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you ask the S.I.T. officers concerned, \"What\r\n\r\nis wrong with my plan? Why do you not approve it?\",\r\n\r\nthey  will reply, \"It is not we who do not approve\r\n\r\nit. It is the Committee appointed by the Governor.\"\r\n\r\nI  do not know under what qualifications these  so-called committees have been appointed. But to me  I\r\n\r\ncan  only conclude that they are appointed  because\r\n\r\nthey know nothing about housing so that they can be\r\n\r\nfooled by the officers of the Singapore Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust. I am not exaggerating when I say this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, I wish to quote a case which\r\n\r\noccurred  only two weeks ago. I attended a  meeting\r\n\r\nto  consider  some of the plans. They  concerned  a\r\n\r\nsemi-detached house in Holland Road.  The  officers\r\n\r\nobjected to it. Naturally I asked them what was the\r\n\r\nobjection.  They  said  that  the  area  had   nice\r\n\r\nresidences,  and  the bungalow was a  semi-detached\r\n\r\nhouse.  I  asked what was wrong with it. They  said\r\n\r\nthat  it  did not conform to the amenities  of  the\r\n\r\narea.  I  asked  them  what  amenities  they   were\r\n\r\nreferring  to, since opposite there was a graveyard\r\n\r\nand  there  were a few bungalows. Then I asked  the\r\n\r\nplanning  officer at the meeting whether he  agreed\r\n\r\nthat  the  plan  conformed to the  density  in  the\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan. He replied that he agreed,  but  said\r\n\r\nthat  it still did not conform to the amenities  of\r\n\r\nthe area concerned. So I asked him what he meant by\r\n\r\namenities  and  whether  he  could  explain  to  me\r\n\r\nclearly.  He said it was very easy. Since my  house\r\n\r\nwas   a  semi-detached  one  and  the  others  were\r\n\r\ndetached  houses,  I  was  not  conforming  to  the\r\n\r\namenities. For example, if a house was a two-storey\r\n\r\nbuilding and the other a one-storey building,  that\r\n\r\nwas  not conforming to the amenities. This was  the\r\n\r\nreply  I  received from one of the officers.  So  I\r\n\r\nturned round and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nasked him to consider the whole lot of bungalows at\r\n\r\nMeyer  Road  and the six-storey hotel,  whether  he\r\n\r\nconsidered  the six-storey hotel conformed  to  the\r\n\r\namenities  as reflected by the bungalows  in  Meyer\r\n\r\nRoad. He said no. I was on the point of telling him\r\n\r\nthat maybe it was because he had been so influenced\r\n\r\nby  string-pulling  that  the  word  \"amenity\"  had\r\n\r\nalready changed its meaning. But I thought that  it\r\n\r\nwas no use talking to this type of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not listen to your arguments. As I have\r\n\r\nsaid  before, they have already made up their minds\r\n\r\nbefore you go in. So what is the use of talking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another case, Sir, I went with the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar. After long consideration,  they\r\n\r\nsaid:  \"Well,  I have no objection  now,  but  what\r\n\r\nabout  the  future? You may change.\"  That  is  the\r\n\r\nattitude you get from the Trust. About the  future,\r\n\r\nSir,  who can foretell? Who can foretell what  will\r\n\r\nbe  in  10  years' time? Could we have thought,  10\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  that  we  could  have  such  political\r\n\r\nadvancement in 1958? We never thought of it. We may\r\n\r\nplan, but really there is no way of foretelling the\r\n\r\nfuture.   Such   is  the  type  of   argument   and\r\n\r\nobstruction  put  up  by the Singapore  Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every time I go to Hongkong, I am\r\n\r\nstunned - there is so vast a change that I  sometimes\r\n\r\nthink whether I have gone to the right place.  They\r\n\r\nhave  apartment houses or flats, as you call  here,\r\n\r\n10 and 20 storeys high on the main road. But if you\r\n\r\never  try  to  put  up  such  sort  of  scheme   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, they will ask you first, \"Where is  your\r\n\r\ncar  park?\" Even if you tell them, \"Oh,  these  are\r\n\r\npoor  people; they do not have cars.  They  do  not\r\n\r\nneed  car  parks\", the reply, Sir,  will  be,  \"Oh,\r\n\r\nthese  people will be rich one day. They will  then\r\n\r\nhave  cars.  Where is your solution?\" I told  them,\r\n\r\nSir,  and  we  also  discussed this  fully  in  the\r\n\r\nBuilding  By-laws Revision Committee  in  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil some years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of a car park is not the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the individual. It is almost  the\r\n\r\nuniversal   practice  all  over   the   world   for\r\n\r\nGovernments to solve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  question  of car parks. If you  consider  that\r\n\r\nthere  should be no parking in the streets or  side\r\n\r\nstreets, then you should prohibit parking.  If  you\r\n\r\nare  thinking  of a way to prevent people  parking,\r\n\r\nthen the only thing to do is to impose a fee on it.\r\n\r\nYou  find  it  all over America. I  think  you  can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprobably find it even in Hawaii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, money alone is not sufficient to solve the\r\n\r\nhousing  problem.  We must have  an  atmosphere  in\r\n\r\nwhich  sympathetic consideration is  given  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment officers concerned. It is then  that  we\r\n\r\ncan attract not only foreign capital but also a lot\r\n\r\nof other capital which is now either in the bank or\r\n\r\nsomewhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point about the S.I.T. policy. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Paya  Lebar  has suggested that  S.I.T. flats\r\n\r\ncould  be sold to the people staying there and  the\r\n\r\nmoney could be utilised to build more flats.  I  am\r\n\r\nstrongly in support of that proposal, Sir,If  the\r\n\r\nflats  in  town could be sold, why should  not  the\r\n\r\nfiats built by the S.I.T. be sold too?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion I would like to make is this.\r\n\r\nGovernments  all  over  the world,  especially  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnited  States, are subsidising housing in  another\r\n\r\nform.  They have made available to the people loans\r\n\r\nat a nominal interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that respect, Sir, we do not only solve the\r\n\r\nhousing problem of that particular person, but also\r\n\r\nit   can   be  used  as  the  best  weapon  against\r\n\r\nCommunism.  If  a  person  owns  a  house  or  owns\r\n\r\nproperty  here,  I am sure he is more  attached  to\r\n\r\nthis  country.  He will also have less  hatred  and\r\n\r\nenmity towards those who have property and houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know very well, Sir, that we collect a lot of\r\n\r\nmoney  in  the Employees' Provident Fund  from  the\r\n\r\npublic.  Instead of investing this money  somewhere\r\n\r\nelse - I do not know whether they have or not, but  I\r\n\r\ndo  know that a lot of money in Singapore has  been\r\n\r\ninvested  somewhere else - I would suggest that  this\r\n\r\nmoney  be made available to housing estates towards\r\n\r\nsolving one of the problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question, Sir, concerns squatters. We\r\n\r\nare  very  sympathetic towards them.  Whether  they\r\n\r\nhave  the  right legally or illegally to the  land,\r\n\r\nthey  are  there. Although there are some squatters\r\n\r\nwho  occupy  the land and build houses for  profit,\r\n\r\nmost of them, however, stay there, not because they\r\n\r\nlike  to  stay there but because that is  the  only\r\n\r\nplace  available for them to stay.  The  Government\r\n\r\nhad  recommended certain scales of compensation for\r\n\r\nthese  squatters, but every time it approached  the\r\n\r\nsquatters  with this scheme, it was  always  turned\r\n\r\ndown in the hope of getting something else. I think\r\n\r\nit  is  high time the Government should step in  to\r\n\r\nsolve  the  squatter problem. Without solving  this\r\n\r\nproblem, housing estates could not be built. If  it\r\n\r\nis   considered  by  the  Government   that   those\r\n\r\ndevelopers  should contribute towards the  cost  of\r\n\r\nsolving such a problem, I am all for it. This is  a\r\n\r\nproblem that is facing not only the developers  but\r\n\r\nthe  Government as well. So I think the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  formulate a policy and try  to  assist  the\r\n\r\ndevelopers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Sir, the question of private housing\r\n\r\nseemed  to the Government to be a matter not  worth\r\n\r\nconsidering. They would insist on what they wanted,\r\n\r\nalthough  it  could  easily be  relaxed  under  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  So,  in this respect,  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will consider all these points,  not  as\r\n\r\npoints  of  attack but as points of  suggestion.

When  I say homeless, I mean  they  lost\r\n\r\njust  the  attap shacks, the leantos in which  they\r\n\r\nhad been living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was at that stage that the Hongkong Government\r\n\r\ndecided that it was necessary to take the matter in\r\n\r\nhand  in a big way, and in view of the size of  the\r\n\r\nproblem,  it could only be solved by speed  and  by\r\n\r\nproviding sub-standard housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squatter resettlement housing units to which\r\n\r\nmy   hon, friend  has  referred  are  seven-storey\r\n\r\nblocks,  and  each floor has communal  bathing  and\r\n\r\nlatrine facilities, and the rooms are, to the  best\r\n\r\nof  my  recollection, 10 ft. by 12 ft. in  which  a\r\n\r\nfamily of five are permitted to live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they pay a rent of HK$14 a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this means of putting up substandard basic\r\n\r\nsubsistence housing, it has been possible  for  the\r\n\r\nHongkong  Government to house at the time  I  left,\r\n\r\nabout  a  year ago, between a quarter of a  million\r\n\r\nand  300,000 people who have been accommodated  and\r\n\r\ntaken off the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the squatter problem still remaining\r\n\r\nwas  roughly the same number, about a quarter of  a\r\n\r\nmillion  to 300,000, and of those, some  60,000  to\r\n\r\n70,000  were squatting on rooftops and  there  were\r\n\r\nstill a certain number in the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do suggest that in considering what has\r\n\r\nbeen  done  in  Hongkong and what is desirable  and\r\n\r\nappropriate   for   the   people   of    Singapore,\r\n\r\nparticularly in regard to the standard of  housing,\r\n\r\nit is necessary to remember and put into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperspective the respective problems confronting the\r\n\r\ntwo Governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, in the jungles of\r\n\r\nMalaya  monkeys swing from tree to tree with  their\r\n\r\nlong  prehensile tails.

I do\r\n\r\nnot  agree with the attacks made on the S.I.T.  The\r\n\r\nmatter has been discussed very frequently before. I\r\n\r\nwould  just  remark  in passing  that,  by  quoting\r\n\r\nparticular cases, or a selection of cases, you  can\r\n\r\nmake  anything appear good or anything appear  bad.\r\n\r\nYou must have a much more thorough examination than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I want to point out are two dangers which\r\n\r\nappear  to me to follow possibly from the  sort  of\r\n\r\nspeeches we have had made about the S.I.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if all the faults alleged against the S.I.T.\r\n\r\nwere  true faults, then we would still need to have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  services  and  the controls which  the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nprovides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Not these men!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It may well be that in any public\r\r\n\r\nservice  there  are defects.

The  housing\r\n\r\nand development matters of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore are absolutely vital for the poor  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore - for the workers. And they must not be\r\n\r\nsacrified  to  ruthless  exploitation  by   private\r\n\r\nproperty and private profit-making interests.  That\r\n\r\nis  the thing we have to guard against. That is why\r\n\r\nwe  have to have controls of all sorts, because the\r\n\r\npressure  of  population on the  land  and  housing\r\n\r\nresources   is   so  great  and   the   chance   of\r\n\r\nexploitation  is so great that you  must  have  the\r\n\r\nbest   system  of  controls  you  can.   Inevitably\r\n\r\nwhenever you have controls, you have people who  do\r\n\r\nnot  like  them  and there will be hard  cases  and\r\n\r\nthere  might  even be injustices. This  has  to  be\r\n\r\naccepted.  But you cannot do without them  all  the\r\n\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wish to make is that you must\r\n\r\nhave public services in Singapore. We have heard  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal, as democracy has become more  powerful\r\n\r\nhere, of violent attacks on public servants.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot   referring  to  expatriates - whether  they  are\r\n\r\nEuropean  expatriates,  or Indian  expatriates,  or\r\n\r\nJapanese  expatriates or whoever they may  be - I  am\r\n\r\nreferring  to local boys and girls, educated  here,\r\n\r\nborn  here, brought up here and serving  here,  and\r\n\r\nthese  are the people who are now already beginning\r\n\r\nto say, \"Perhaps I had better move to another place\r\n\r\nbecause this is an intolerable town to work in.\" If\r\n\r\nyou  are a public servant, your mouth is shut,  you\r\n\r\ncannot  reply and you have got to listen to endless\r\n\r\npublic  noisy attacks on you. If those  who  attack\r\n\r\nour public servants succeed in driving them out  of\r\n\r\nthe  territory, they will have nothing  to  replace\r\n\r\nthem with. You cannot replace, at short notice, the\r\n\r\nexperience  and  skill acquired over  a  period  of\r\n\r\nyears.  I  do see the most serious danger  that  if\r\n\r\nthese  attacks go on for the next few years,  there\r\n\r\nwill   be   a   serious  rundown  in  the   already\r\n\r\nhardpressed local officers who have got to carry on\r\n\r\nthe public services of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I hope that I will  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nclarify   one  point  which  has  been  raised   in\r\n\r\nconnection with the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been criticised for making only $7 million\r\n\r\navailable  for  housing this year. I thought,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat I had explained the situation when I presented\r\n\r\nthe   Budget.   There   are  three   reasons.   The\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Estimates  provide   only   for   the\r\n\r\ncompletion  of  work in hand. These  reasons  were,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  the  amount  which we  could  still  make\r\n\r\navailable from reserves was limited. In the  second\r\n\r\ninstance, development in the future would  have  to\r\n\r\nbe  financed mainly from loans, and we did not know\r\n\r\nhow successful we would be in this respect in 1959.\r\n\r\nLastly,  we  did not wish to tie the hands  of  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnext  government  by  commencing  too  many  costly\r\n\r\npublic works. These are the reasons why no more was\r\n\r\nprovided for housing. We merely provided enough  to\r\n\r\nallow the S.I.T. to complete the contracts in hand.\r\n\r\nIt  is not that Government does not appreciate  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportance of housing. I think the expenditure over\r\n\r\nthe   past  four  years  indicates  just  how  much\r\n\r\nimportance Government does attach to housing.  Over\r\n\r\n25  per  cent  of  all development expenditure  was\r\n\r\nspent   on  housing.  I  am  sure  that  the   next\r\n\r\ngovernment will feel much the same way about it  as\r\n\r\nthe  present  Government. It is  a  most  important\r\n\r\nmatter.  I  should imagine that one  of  the  first\r\n\r\nthings that the new Government will do will  be  to\r\n\r\nconsider    housing   in   connection   with    the\r\n\r\nSupplementary Development Estimates which  will  be\r\n\r\nput  forward  once they have decided when  and  how\r\n\r\nmuch they will obtain from a loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I must again draw attention to a\r\n\r\npoint  which I made before, and that is that,  with\r\n\r\nthe  best will in the world, it is doubtful if  any\r\n\r\nfuture  government will be able  to  make  as  much\r\n\r\navailable for housing as we have been able to do in\r\n\r\nthe  past.  The money will just not  be  there.  It\r\n\r\nwould therefore be necessary to make what we obtain\r\n\r\nfor housing go as far as possible, and to think out\r\n\r\nalternative and complementary schemes to  meet  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  it.  It  is  for  these  reasons  that\r\n\r\nGovernment welcomes all the suggestions which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  today. I can assure hon. Member's  that\r\n\r\nall  the  suggestions which have been made will  be\r\n\r\nexamined with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreat  care. Some of them, of course, have  already\r\n\r\nbeen  examined,  or  are in the  process  of  being\r\n\r\nexamined  by Government. I have much sympathy  with\r\n\r\nsome  of the suggestions. I have felt for some time\r\n\r\nthat we should explore the one-room flatlet concept\r\n\r\nmore  thoroughly  than we have done.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, I must point out that our examination of  the\r\n\r\nproblem to date has indicted that it is not as easy\r\n\r\nas  some  hon. Members would suppose. In  point  of\r\n\r\nfact,  Sir,  the cost of a one-room  flatlet  which\r\n\r\nwould  be acceptable to the people of Singapore  is\r\n\r\nnot very much different from the cost of a two-room\r\n\r\nflatlet.  But I think we should examine the  matter\r\n\r\nyet  again and again, because I feel there is  some\r\n\r\nsolution  which will enable us to meet the  housing\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion from the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar that we should create a revolving fund,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to be certain that the  fund  would\r\n\r\nrevolve and that the people who would benefit  from\r\n\r\nit  would  be  able  to repay the  sum  which  they\r\n\r\nborrowed  from the fund. Even if we could  have  an\r\n\r\nassurance on that point, there would still  remain,\r\n\r\nat  this  particular point in time, the trouble  of\r\n\r\nfinding money for the fund. But then again, Sir, if\r\n\r\nthis  scheme were to offer a part solution  to  the\r\n\r\nhousing problem, I am sure the Government will go a\r\n\r\nvery long way to try and provide facilities for the\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hon. Member did mention that he saw no trouble\r\n\r\nin  floating  a loan for housing. With  respect,  I\r\n\r\ndoubt  whether  that is the case. I think  we  will\r\n\r\nfind  it extremely hard to float a loan for housing\r\n\r\nspecifically  and, in any event, Sir, the  proceeds\r\n\r\nof  any  loans which we have to float in the future\r\n\r\nfor development will have to be divided amongst all\r\n\r\nthe projects to which Government attaches priority;\r\n\r\none of which, of course, is housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another hon. Member, Sir, said that the money\r\n\r\nsubscribed to the Central Provident Fund should  be\r\n\r\nused for housing. I think he also said that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney  in the Provident Fund should be invested  in\r\n\r\nthis  territory. On that latter point, Sir, I  have\r\n\r\nevery sympathy and I would say that I hope that the\r\n\r\nBoard of the Provident Fund will in the future  see\r\n\r\ntheir  way to invest rather more locally than  they\r\n\r\nhave done in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point Sir, I would say that we will\r\n\r\nhave  to rely to a very great extent on the support\r\n\r\nof  the Provident Fund for any future loan which is\r\n\r\nfloated  in  Singapore and, as I  said,  we  cannot\r\n\r\ndevote  all  the subscriptions from  that  fund  to\r\n\r\nhousing.  It  would have to be apportioned  amongst\r\n\r\nthe  other  projects  to which Government  attaches\r\n\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I understand that  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nPasir Panjang has brought up two points. One is the\r\n\r\nquestion of money and the other is the question  of\r\n\r\nbuilding standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allocation of money, I think\r\n\r\nthe  Hon, the Financial Secretary has  replied  to\r\n\r\nthat.  With regard to the lowering of standards,  I\r\n\r\nthink  this  morning  the  Assistant  Minister  has\r\n\r\nalready  spoken on this point in his reply  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Paya  Lebar. The prototype  scheme  is\r\n\r\nbeing  studied  and when it has been completed,  we\r\n\r\nshall  be able to come to our conclusions. For  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  this scheme, the standards  are  being\r\n\r\nreduced  in many ways. Maximum densities are  being\r\n\r\nallowed, and certain local government building  by-laws with regard to room space, height of ceilings,\r\n\r\nfoundations, roads, drains and sewerage  are  being\r\n\r\nwaived to agreed standards. However, this scheme is\r\n\r\nonly  in respect of low-cost housing, that is,  for\r\n\r\nhouses  which can be sold for not more than $5,000.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean, of course, that the standard of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall types of houses should be lowered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this morning again, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown did ask why there should  be\r\n\r\npreferential  allotment of money  for  housing  the\r\n\r\nMalays. Sir, Members are aware of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoverty of the members of my community. If we  were\r\n\r\nto  look  at  the social strata of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we will find that in the  case  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese community we have the capitalist class, the\r\n\r\nprofessional  class, the upper  middle  class,  the\r\n\r\nlower   middle   class   and   the   workers.   The\r\n\r\ndistribution is the same with regard to the  Indian\r\n\r\ncommunity.   But  when  it  comes  to   the   Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity, we have no Malay capitalists,  no  Malay\r\n\r\nprofessional  class, no Malay upper  middle  class,\r\n\r\nvery few in the lower middle class; the majority of\r\n\r\nthem  are  workers.  In fact, I  can  say  that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore 99 per cent of my community come  from  a\r\n\r\nclass  drawing  a salary of not more  than  $120  a\r\n\r\nmonth. It is for this reason, Sir, that we on  this\r\n\r\nside  of the House feel that the time has come  for\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  come  forward and  help  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity with regard to housing. Of course, I know\r\n\r\nthat  there  are also members of other  communities\r\n\r\nfaced  with the same difficulties, as poverty knows\r\n\r\nno  communal  barriers, but  to  them  the  housing\r\n\r\nprovided  by the Singapore Improvement Trust  built\r\n\r\non  long-term loans, at lower than normal rates  of\r\n\r\ninterest,  provides  some  relief.  Generally   the\r\n\r\nMalays  find the Singapore Improvement Trust houses\r\n\r\nunsuited to their requirements, as is evidenced  by\r\n\r\ntheir  very sparse representation in the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust  rentals  and  on  the   housing\r\n\r\nregister. The Trust tenant is not asked to  provide\r\n\r\nany  capital contribution towards his own  housing,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  considered equitable  that  the  Malay\r\n\r\nsettler should be assisted in the provision of such\r\n\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not forget, Sir, with regard to housing in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  that  for years now the  Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   has  spent  millions  of   dollars   on\r\n\r\nresettlement  and  compensation; but  there  again,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,   the  Malay   community   has   not\r\n\r\nbenefited at all and I think, Sir, it is  the  duty\r\n\r\nof  this  Government, or of any government  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture,  if it wants to be honest and fair to  all,\r\n\r\nto  see that every citizen of Singapore gets a fair\r\n\r\nshare of the country's wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister has misunderstood what  I  said\r\n\r\nthis  morning.

What I said this morning  was\r\n\r\nthat  I  would be far happier if the same  type  of\r\n\r\nscheme  could  be offered to all other  communities\r\n\r\ninstead   of   introducing  it  for  a   particular\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Financial Secretary gave reasons\r\n\r\nthat  the Government did not want to tie the  hands\r\n\r\nof  the  next  government when  budgeting  only  $7\r\n\r\nmillion   for  housing  next  year.  By   such   an\r\n\r\nexplanation,  do  I  take it that  whilst  this  $7\r\n\r\nmillion  was  provided for in the Budget,  he  took\r\n\r\ninto  consideration  the life  of  this  Government\r\n\r\nwhich  may be up to next April or the life  of  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. which  may  be a matter  of  two  or  three\r\n\r\nmonths, or is it budgeted for a whole year?

They have  asked\r\n\r\nthe  public  to  come forward, as  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown said, to help them in the allocation  of\r\n\r\nhouses. I have received such an invitation,  but  I\r\n\r\nhave declined to appear. The reason is very simple.\r\n\r\nWith   so   very  few  houses  and  with  so   many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplicants, it is just impossible to allocate  them\r\n\r\nto  all  the applicants. No matter how  much  of  a\r\n\r\ngenius  you  are,  you cannot  solve  that  problem\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily if you do not have enough houses. It\r\n\r\nis  like in a state of famine - you have two bags  of\r\n\r\nrice to feed a population of 10,000 people, and you\r\n\r\nare invited to distribute the rice as best you can.\r\n\r\nNo  matter  how  it goes, there will  be  a  larger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber  of people going hungry, and only a few  are\r\n\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I view the problem of housing in a general way. If\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T. were  efficient  in  its  housing  and\r\n\r\nplanning,  the  housing problem  would  not  be  so\r\n\r\nacute.  If  it  cannot build enough  houses,  I  am\r\n\r\ncertain  that  private enterprise could  have  been\r\n\r\nencouraged  by  the  Trust  to  help  build  enough\r\n\r\nhouses. The failure of the Trust can be seen by the\r\n\r\nfact that more than 10,000 unauthorised houses have\r\n\r\nsprung up. There are a few reasons given for  this.\r\n\r\nOne  is  that  anybody who wants to build  a  house\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinds  it very irksome to go to the S.I.T. to  ask\r\n\r\nfor  their  plans to be approved. In fact,  in  the\r\n\r\nminds  of  the people of Singapore, or anybody  who\r\n\r\nwants  to  build a house, the building and planning\r\n\r\nauthorities  of the S.I.T. are more an  obstruction\r\n\r\nto them than a help! In fact, many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  them, when told, \"If you want to build a little\r\n\r\nhouse,  you  must first go to this  department  and\r\n\r\nthen to the S.I.T., and then come back again to the\r\n\r\nother  department,\" feel, \"Well, this is  too  much\r\n\r\nfor  us.  We will rather put up a house in any  old\r\n\r\nway  possible.  We  will face the consequences.  We\r\n\r\nwill  appear  in Court after receiving the  summons\r\n\r\nand  we will happily pay our fines and live in  our\r\n\r\nhouses.\"  Now  such has been the  attitude  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  and,  in many instances, I  regret  to  say\r\n\r\npersonal experience has borne out that fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Planning Department and the Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority had been sympathetic with the public (one\r\n\r\nof  the  officers in the Planning Section  is  very\r\n\r\nhelpful   to  the  public)  the  public  would   be\r\n\r\nencouraged. Now I will say what is the attitude  of\r\n\r\nthis  particular officer that the  people  want  to\r\n\r\npraise him for? You go to him with a problem and he\r\n\r\ntells  you what the situation is. He goes  further,\r\n\r\nand  advises you as to the many ways in  which  you\r\n\r\ncan  utilize  your land or alter your  building  or\r\n\r\nwhatever  it  is to dovetail with the Master  Plan.\r\n\r\nNow,  that  officer has the support of  the  people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngenerally.  Sir, not all officers in Government  or\r\n\r\nin  the Trust are condemned by the people. No, Sir.\r\n\r\nMany  are  praised. We have heard in this  Assembly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npraises  going  out  to so many of  the  Government\r\n\r\nofficers.  Of  course, if there are praises,  there\r\n\r\nmust  be grouses too. I would say that if a  grouse\r\n\r\ncomes from one or two individuals about one or  two\r\n\r\ncivil  servants,  we will say that  their  view  is\r\n\r\nprobably  biased;  they probably  have  an  axe  to\r\n\r\ngrind.  But  if  it is the general opinion  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, whether supported by facts  or\r\n\r\nnot,  there  must be something wrong! I  am  not  a\r\n\r\nbuilder or a developer. I have not put up houses of\r\n\r\nmy own, except public institutions, and yet I speak\r\n\r\nin  this trend not for anything else but merely  to\r\n\r\npoint  out to Government that if there is a grouse,\r\n\r\nthat   grouse   must   be  investigated.   In   all\r\n\r\nprobability,  it  might be justified,  and  if  the\r\n\r\npeople  are  satisfied with Government departments,\r\n\r\nwork  can be done more smoothly. I am certain  that\r\n\r\nwith more people like the Planning Officer I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmentioned just now, Singapore can build houses much\r\n\r\nmore rapidly than we can imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that sometimes it is very difficult for us\r\n\r\nto  say  whether  the Planning  Department  is  the\r\n\r\nauthority for education, or the Education  Ministry\r\n\r\nis  the  authority! I have had a case of  a  school\r\n\r\nwhich  has  to  go  through that  department.  This\r\n\r\nhappened to be in the rural area - the burial  ground\r\n\r\nat  Tan Tock Seng Hospital. According to the Master\r\n\r\nPlan,  if  you have one acre of land, you can  only\r\n\r\nhave five classrooms and no more. I happened to  be\r\n\r\na  Member  of the Select Committee on the Education\r\n\r\nBill,  and  I remember the Minister said,  \"We  are\r\n\r\nvery  short of playing fields and when this  matter\r\n\r\ncomes   up,  we  will  consider  every  case   most\r\n\r\nsympathetically.\" I remember this clearly,  because\r\n\r\nI had his assurance before I withdrew my amendment.\r\n\r\nThen we have cases where the Government agree,  and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neven the S.I.T. agree. I know that it stares us  in\r\n\r\nthe  face - the school at Coleman Street with  little\r\n\r\nplayground  is  allowed  to  carry  on   with   its\r\n\r\nbuilding.  We know that there is another school  in\r\n\r\nTelok  Ayer  Street that is allowed  to  run,  with\r\n\r\npractically  no  playground  at  all.   These   are\r\n\r\nGovernment-aided  schools. Yet I  know  of  another\r\n\r\nschool,  a  Government school, the Stamford  Girls'\r\n\r\nSchool that is built on land with almost no playing\r\n\r\nfield. And yet when any plan goes to the S.I.T. for\r\n\r\na  school building, they insist on large tracts  of\r\n\r\nland as playground for a school, either in town  or\r\n\r\nin  the rural areas. I fail to see eye to eye  with\r\n\r\nthem,  and I fail to see where the co-operation  is\r\n\r\nbetween the Trust and the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with so many unauthorised hr uses coming up in\r\n\r\nthe rural areas, Sir, I think there is also another\r\n\r\nreason,  and that is because the public are  house-hungry. They are prepared to pay anything in  order\r\n\r\nto  have  a  roof  over  them.  This  situation  is\r\n\r\ncreated,  of  course,  as you  know,  by  the  slow\r\n\r\nplanning  and  slow  passing  of  plans,  and  this\r\n\r\nsituation is also exploited by many people. I  know\r\n\r\nthat landowners with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlarge  estates  will not stop at exploiting  people\r\n\r\nwho  want to build houses. I know that they  charge\r\n\r\nsomething like $800 for permission to be  given  to\r\n\r\nthe  person wanting to build a house, say, 20  feet\r\n\r\nby 40 feet; or they give that permission based on a\r\n\r\nfee of a dollar per square foot. The builder has no\r\n\r\nalternative. He has no money to pay for a big piece\r\n\r\nof  land, because land is always sold in big  lots.\r\n\r\nAnd   he  has  to  build.  Again  he  comes  across\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficulties  with  the authorities.  He  dare  not\r\n\r\nbuild his house. Therefore, the racketeers come  in\r\n\r\nto  cash  in on such difficulties. That problem  is\r\n\r\ncreated  by difficulties experienced by the  people\r\n\r\nwanting  to  build their own houses. The racketeers\r\n\r\ncome  in, build the houses and tell them that  they\r\n\r\nhave   been   passed  by  the  proper  authorities,\r\n\r\notherwise  they would not be there.  Money  changes\r\n\r\nhands  and  the  person living in the  unauthorised\r\n\r\nhouse, of course, will receive a summons. He  faces\r\n\r\nthe consequences, not the builder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have advocated in this House many times the\r\n\r\nallocation  of  land for people  wanting  to  build\r\n\r\ntheir  own  houses. I remember on many occasions  I\r\n\r\nhave  related what the squatters did -  they  banded\r\n\r\nthemselves together to pay the land, as in the case\r\n\r\nof  the  Union  Housing Estate in Upper  Serangoon,\r\n\r\nwhere  they got together and bought the  land  from\r\n\r\nthe  landowner. They subdivided the land into  lots\r\n\r\namongst  themselves and built their own  houses  or\r\n\r\nimproved  the  houses  that were  existing  on  the\r\n\r\nestate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support, Sir, the move made by the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar  to  get  the  Government  to  have   a\r\n\r\nrevolving  fund to buy land for attap dwellers.  If\r\n\r\nan  attap dweller or anybody wants to pay a  dollar\r\n\r\nper  square  foot for land on which  permission  is\r\n\r\ngiven  to  him to build, then I see no  reason  why\r\n\r\nanybody who wants to build cannot buy that piece of\r\n\r\nland  from  Government at $1,000 or $2,000 - probably\r\n\r\nnot  at $1 per square foot, but at fifty cents  per\r\n\r\nsquare foot. It will help when the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  have the land, for then they will  dare  to\r\n\r\nsink in their money. There will then be less grouse\r\n\r\nabout this housing shortage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always advocated that Government should\r\n\r\nhelp  the  people to help them solve their  housing\r\n\r\nproblem.  If we have little plots of land laid  out\r\n\r\nproperly,  plans  put  up simply  and  easily,  and\r\n\r\npassed  quickly by the authorities, it  will  go  a\r\n\r\nvery  long  way  towards  helping  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think all\r\n\r\nhon.  Members will agree with me that we are deeply\r\n\r\nimpressed  by  the  Minister for Local  Government,\r\n\r\nLands  and  Housing for his emotional  and  sincere\r\n\r\nreply   about  providing  houses  for   the   Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity. If I am not mistaken, this Government is\r\n\r\nunfortunately only responsible to the Assembly, and\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  does not have direct  administrative\r\n\r\ncontrol  over the planning and housing problems  of\r\n\r\nthe   S.I.T.   Therefore,  the  responsibility   is\r\n\r\nunfortunately  in  the hands of the  energetic  and\r\n\r\nsympathetic  Minister for Local  Government,  Lands\r\n\r\nand  Housing,  who  is close to  the  mass  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.   If  I  may  use  an  English  proverb - the\r\n\r\ntackling of the housing problem up to the last  few\r\n\r\nyears  has  been just like putting the cart  before\r\n\r\nthe  horse. Everything was done to provide for  the\r\n\r\nmiddle class. The middle class, in the mind of  the\r\n\r\nCity planner, is a very important group; they are a\r\n\r\nstabilising  factor in our country;  and  therefore\r\n\r\nall housing projects (although the taxpayers' money\r\n\r\nhas  been  expended  for this  purpose)  have  been\r\n\r\nconcentrated  on building houses and providing  for\r\n\r\nthe convenience of the middle class. Sir, I hate to\r\n\r\nterm  this  the old colonial policy, but  it  looks\r\n\r\nexactly  like  a  colonial policy. It  is  entirely\r\n\r\nremoved  from the poor masses, who cry  out  for  a\r\n\r\nlittle  security and to be able to  live  in  attap\r\n\r\nhouses. But they do not get the chance despite  the\r\n\r\nefforts   of   the   hard-working   Department   of\r\n\r\nInformation  Services  Officers  who  have   issued\r\n\r\npamphlets  and  pictures to  publicise  the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am telling the truth. The kampong folks,\r\n\r\nwhether they are Malays or Chinese, are farmers  or\r\n\r\nfishermen. They just could not care less for the so-called  Master Plan. What do multi-storey buildings\r\n\r\nmean to them? Nothing! They know they cannot afford\r\n\r\nto  pay  the rent to live in them. I wonder whether\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  has any figures at  hand  so  as  to\r\n\r\ninform this House of the number of eviction notices\r\n\r\nthat have been served by the S.I.T. authorities  on\r\n\r\nthose  tenants who have failed to pay  their  rent.\r\n\r\nHow  many  summonses have they served? Why?  It  is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njust because these tenants cannot afford to pay the\r\n\r\nrent.   The  Minister  will  say  that  there   are\r\n\r\nthousands of people who are on the waiting list for\r\n\r\nhouses, and if the tenants cannot pay the rent they\r\n\r\nmust  quit.  The Government do not care where  they\r\n\r\ngo.  The  S.I.T. authorities  serve  the  eviction\r\n\r\nnotices,  and if the tenants fail to pay the  rent,\r\n\r\ntheir furniture is seized and auctioned. The S.I.T.\r\n\r\ncould not care much about the consequences. As long\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  the  tenants are unable to pay the  rent,  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  quit. It is not easy to find a  piece  of\r\n\r\nland. I mentioned yesterday that the landlord knows\r\n\r\nthat  if he wants to make a piece of land valuable,\r\n\r\nhe  must  not allow squatters to settle on  it.  If\r\n\r\nthere  are any squatters, the price will be reduced\r\n\r\nto nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the problem. That is the main reason why\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Local  Government,  Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing  has  moved  to build  a  Malay  settlement\r\n\r\nscheme.  Naturally,  Sir,  he  deserves  the   full\r\n\r\nsupport of this House. I hope that it will be  only\r\n\r\nthe first step. Any government and any Ministry  in\r\n\r\ncharge of housing should bear this problem in mind.\r\n\r\nDo  not  make the silly mistake of supporting  only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  middle class who can well afford to pay a rent\r\n\r\nof  $20 or $30 a month. But do the Government  know\r\n\r\nthat  many  of the poor ra'ayat - whether  Malays  or\r\n\r\nChinese - cannot earn as much as $20 or $30 a  month?\r\n\r\nI  know too well that many farmers in my kampong at\r\n\r\nSiglap  receive  public assistance allowances  from\r\n\r\nthe Department of Social Welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of encouraging people to buy their\r\n\r\nown houses, I have advocated several times that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  ask the S.I.T. to  sell  their\r\n\r\nflats to those tenants who are willing to buy them.\r\n\r\nWith  the money obtained from this sale, Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould build more houses for the lower income group.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  the Minister will reply that  in  some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplaces,  low-cost houses have been put up and  that\r\n\r\nthere are a lot of houses at Paterson Road for  the\r\n\r\nlower   income  group.  But  they  are  still   not\r\n\r\nsufficient. What I would like to advocate is  this:\r\n\r\nstop building multi-storey flats, which are usually\r\n\r\nrented  to tenants who own cars, estates  and  have\r\n\r\nhouses  of  their  own.  I  have  already  made   a\r\n\r\nstatement  that the tenants of S.I.T. flats  often\r\n\r\nhave  two or three wives. Sir, this is, of  course,\r\n\r\nvery  true. These tenants are able to pay the  rent\r\n\r\ncharged  for S.I.T. flats whatever the amount.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should find ways and means  of  raising\r\n\r\nmoney from these wealthy tenants of S.I.T. flats by\r\n\r\ncompelling them to buy their flats. If the  tenants\r\n\r\nfail  to do so, they must quit the flats. The money\r\n\r\nobtained  from this sale could be spent on building\r\n\r\nmore low-cost houses for the lower income group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is to urge the Government to survey\r\n\r\nthe  future.  Is  it possible for the  planners  of\r\n\r\nhousing projects to make a thorough survey  of  the\r\n\r\ncapital  income  of  the population  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbefore any planning of housing projects is started?\r\n\r\nIf the Government are sure that the majority of the\r\n\r\npopulation belong to the middle class, or that  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the wage-earners will be able to pay  a\r\n\r\nrent of, say, $20 per month, then Government should\r\n\r\nbuild more houses at a rental of $20 per month. But\r\n\r\nat  present the majority are not able to  pay  even\r\n\r\nthis  rent.  So it is common for these  tenants  of\r\n\r\nS.I.T. flats  to be served eviction  notices  when\r\n\r\nthey fail to pay their rents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These eviction notices are also served on those\r\n\r\nwho  share  their flats with one or more  families.\r\n\r\nThe   authorities  could  not  understand  why  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntenants   share  their  flats.  Why  cannot   these\r\n\r\nfamilies live in one flat? This is an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomic problem. It is because the tenants  cannot\r\n\r\npay  the high rent charged that they are forced  to\r\n\r\nshare their flats with some other families. The sub-tenants need not be their friends. Any stranger who\r\n\r\ncan  help them pay the rent will be accepted  as  a\r\n\r\nsub-tenant. This is a fact, and yet the S.I.T. have\r\n\r\nno  mercy on them. As long as they find that  there\r\n\r\nare  unauthorised tenants in the flat,  they  force\r\n\r\nthem  to  quit. I cannot understand why.  Everybody\r\n\r\nlikes a comfortable home; everybody likes to occupy\r\n\r\na  whole flat if he can afford it. But if he cannot\r\n\r\npay  or is unemployed, there is no harm in his sub-letting his flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came across a case two weeks ago of an\r\n\r\nunemployed tenant who had been in receipt of public\r\n\r\nrelief  assistance  for nine months,  and  who  was\r\n\r\nsharing  his flat with two bachelors - one a  teacher\r\n\r\nand the other a clerk. But unfortunately, these two\r\n\r\noccupants  were  told  to  quit  when  the   S.I.T.\r\n\r\nauthorities discovered the sub-letting. This tenant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  forced  to  sub-let  his  flat  to  two  other\r\n\r\nfamilies, one a newly-married couple and the  other\r\n\r\na  family of three - husband, wife and a son. But the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. officers also discovered this and the tenant\r\n\r\nwas  told  either to quit the flat or to evict  the\r\n\r\nunauthorised  sub-tenants. The tenant was  prepared\r\n\r\nto  quit,  provided I could find him  accommodation\r\n\r\nthat  is  within his means. This tenant,  and  many\r\n\r\nlike him, cannot afford to pay even the rent of  an\r\n\r\nS.I.T. flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The examples that I have quoted will be\r\n\r\nsufficiently  clear  to show to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLocal  Government, Lands and Housing that the  past\r\n\r\nhousing policy was wrong. The policy was framed not\r\n\r\nto  help  the  lower  income group,  that  is,  the\r\n\r\nra'ayat,  but to benefit the middle class. Actually\r\n\r\nthe  middle  class can, with a little subsidy  from\r\n\r\nGovernment, buy their own houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I wish to extend my hearty\r\n\r\nsupport of the move made by the Minister for  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,   Lands  and  Housing  to   provide   a\r\n\r\nsettlement for the Malays. I only wish that he will\r\n\r\nerect such a settlement not only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the Malays, but also for the attap dwellers  of\r\n\r\nother races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree\r\n\r\nentirely  with  the  remarks of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works that good and  experienced\r\n\r\nofficers  are difficult to find, and that  we  must\r\n\r\nnot  do  anything to discourage them and make  them\r\n\r\nleave  this  place, especially when we are  on  the\r\n\r\nverge of self-government. But I am very shocked  at\r\n\r\nhis  contempt  for  this  House  by  comparing  the\r\n\r\nMembers here to the inmates of the forests  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I thought I did pull the\r\n\r\nMinister up for being unparliamentary. Once I  have\r\n\r\ndone  that, I do not think any other Member  should\r\n\r\ncomment on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Yes, Sir. As regards the one-room flats which I mentioned, there are many such\r\n\r\nexamples put up by the Government as well as by the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. in Singapore. Take, for instance, the  flats\r\n\r\nin  Cross Street, Mosque Street, North Bridge Road,\r\n\r\nKreta Ayer Road and, I think, in Banda Street  too.\r\n\r\nAll these are one-room flats. They share a communal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbathroom and a communal kitchen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the building by-laws, it has been\r\n\r\nprovided,  in  the  case of shop-houses  especially\r\n\r\nwhich  were  originally built for  renting  out  to\r\n\r\ndifferent  families, that for every three  cubicles\r\n\r\nyou  have  to  provide a bathroom,  a  W.C. and  a\r\n\r\nkitchen.  These are for cubicle flats of  not  less\r\n\r\nthan  100 square feet, and in case it exceeds  that\r\n\r\nsize,   the  facilities  should  be  increased   in\r\n\r\nproportion. You will agree, Sir, that this  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  ideal way to house the people. But as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  Sir, these people have not enough money,  so\r\n\r\nthe best way is to spread out to as many people  as\r\n\r\npossible.  Even  if they have the money,  then  the\r\n\r\nquestion   of   rent  arises  again,  because   the\r\n\r\nGovernment is expected to receive rent at least  at\r\n\r\nthe  normal interest rate, even if, as is said, the\r\n\r\nflats are subsidised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Secretary has just mentioned that\r\n\r\nthe  cost of these one-room flats is not very  much\r\n\r\nlower  than  the  two-room flats or the  three-room\r\n\r\nflats.  I think he misunderstood me. What he  means\r\n\r\nby  a one-room flat is - it has a room, a kitchen,  a\r\n\r\nbathroom, a W.C., all self-contained. What I  mean,\r\n\r\nand what Hongkong provides, is this: you have a one-bedroom, a common sitting room; the approach is  by\r\n\r\na  corridor  and a communal bathroom and  W.C. are\r\n\r\nshared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government are fortunate later and can\r\n\r\nprovide  better  accommodation for  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  there  is  no  difficulty  at  all   in\r\n\r\nconverting,  at only little expense, a  one-bedroom\r\n\r\nflat  into  a two-bedroom flat or a flat  with  two\r\n\r\nbedrooms  cum  sitting  room.  But  we  must   face\r\n\r\nrealities  now. What are we going to  do  with  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  now?  What  is  the  use  of\r\n\r\ntalking, \"Yes, you keep quiet now. We will  try  to\r\n\r\nsolve  your  problem  in 20  years'  time.  In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  you  may  die;  but  never  mind,   your\r\n\r\nchildren will benefit by it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What good will that kind of talk serve? Also, are\r\n\r\nwe  sure that the housing problem will be solved in\r\n\r\n20  years' time? I do not see how it is possible to\r\n\r\nprovide   accommodation   as   outlined   by    the\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust  and  other  organisations.   My\r\n\r\npersonal  opinion is that you give those  who  want\r\n\r\nhouses  whatever is possible and then, if  you  are\r\n\r\nfortunate  enough later, you can provide them  with\r\n\r\nbetter  accommodation. By this means, not only  can\r\n\r\nyou  provide more housing for more people, but also\r\n\r\nyou can in a way charge them at the rate which they\r\n\r\ncan afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this question of land. There is no\r\n\r\nreason  why  the Government cannot buy  some  land,\r\n\r\nalthough I know the Government have not much  land.\r\n\r\nBuy  it  and  have it laid out. Have  drains  made;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovide  approaches,  not  necessarily  first-class\r\n\r\nones,  and  sell or let out to the people  who,  in\r\n\r\nturn, can build houses. Or provide them with some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandard  plans which they can get from  the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard, say, for a dollar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know by saying this the architects will be angry\r\n\r\nwith me, but this is the way to help the people, so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  build  with  whatever  money  they\r\n\r\nhave - $3,000 or $5,000 - and build to a type which  is\r\n\r\nmore suitable to their needs. We have an example of\r\n\r\nthis,  Sir. In pre-war days, we had to evict a  lot\r\n\r\nof squatters from the Bukit Berlayer River Basin in\r\n\r\nthe  Harbour Board area. The attap huts there  were\r\n\r\nall  built  hastily. We consulted these people  and\r\n\r\noffered them flats which were built further inland,\r\n\r\nbut  they  were all of the opinion that they  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  have huts. So what we did was to get  the\r\n\r\nland levelled, drained and had the lots marked out.\r\n\r\nWe said, \"Now we give you a lot; you go and build.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same conditions exist now in Aljunied Road. I\r\n\r\nthink it is the Government which have provided  the\r\n\r\nland  there, have it laid out and properly drained.\r\n\r\nI think they must have let it out to the people who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  dehoused  somewhere else. They  have  put  up\r\n\r\nquite  decent  houses there. I am sure  anyone  who\r\n\r\ngoes  and  see  these  houses  put  up  under  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances will agree with me that they are  not\r\n\r\nso bad, for they too provide accommodation like the\r\n\r\nS.I.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very\r\n\r\ngrateful  to  those Members of the House  who  have\r\n\r\nspoken in support of the proposal that I have  made\r\n\r\nthis   morning.   Even  the  Minister   for   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Lands and Housing, and  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary   have  also  given  my  proposal   their\r\n\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only doubt that has so far been raised has\r\n\r\nbeen  the Hon, the Financial Secretary. He says  he\r\n\r\nis  not certain whether the $1 million which I have\r\n\r\nsuggested  should  be created as a  revolving  fund\r\n\r\nwould  indeed  be a revolving fund.  Sir,  from  my\r\n\r\nexperience,  I  can  give him  that  assurance.  If\r\n\r\n10,000  people have already paid $20 million profit\r\n\r\nfor  these  houses,  is  it not  possible  now  for\r\n\r\nanother 10,000 families to find $500 to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$1,000  each to pay for a plot of land after  which\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  have to pay $10 or $15  a  month  as\r\n\r\nrental?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Pasir Panjang has drawn my\r\n\r\nattention  to the Aljunied Housing Estate.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nSir, that is within my area and I can say that when\r\n\r\nit  was  decided  to resettle the people  in  Upper\r\n\r\nAljunied Estate, the original suggestion, I  think,\r\n\r\nwas  made  by  the Hon. the Assistant Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare,  that  the  land  should   be\r\n\r\nparcelled out to the settlers in small plots  after\r\n\r\nwater had been laid on and road paths made. Half of\r\n\r\nthe  lots  were issued in that respect. The  people\r\n\r\nwere  allowed  to  build any type  of  houses  they\r\n\r\nliked. Unfortunately, we had a very prim and proper\r\n\r\nGovernor - His   Excellency  Sir  John   Nicoll.   He\r\n\r\nhappened  to pass that way; he saw what was  taking\r\n\r\nplace,  and he suddenly called a halt to everything\r\n\r\nand said: \"Good heavens! They are now making a slum\r\n\r\nof  that  area  again by having these ugly  houses.\r\n\r\nThey are very comfortable and livable, but they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot pretty, and there is no standard design.\" So he\r\n\r\nstopped the scheme half-way and asked the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust to put up blocks of  flats,  all\r\n\r\none-storey houses, costing $3,000 each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say, Sir, on the whole, these $3,000 flats\r\n\r\nhave  not been satisfactory. They are very low  and\r\n\r\neveryday  I receive complaints of leaks  and  heat,\r\n\r\nand there is a tremendous amount of maintenance  to\r\n\r\nbe done. Whereas on the other side, where a man was\r\n\r\nallowed  to  put  up his own house,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust did not have to pay a single cent\r\n\r\non maintenance. The settler there undoubtedly takes\r\n\r\nin  a  few  more tenants to help him  pay  for  his\r\n\r\nservice  charges,  but they are all  happy  and  no\r\n\r\nfurther demands are made on the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite sure that if the Financial Secretary\r\n\r\nwill  seriously study the position, he  will  agree\r\n\r\nwith me and his doubts will fade away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Hon. the Minister for Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Lands and Housing  has  on  the  whole\r\n\r\naccepted my proposal and says that he will take the\r\n\r\nmatter up, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum of $8,340,000 for Head D22 stand\r\n\r\npart of the Schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope I\r\n\r\nwill  not  be accused of bringing up a  very  stale\r\n\r\nsubject which was raised by me last year.

As I have  said,\r\n\r\nthis  question was raised by me last  year,  but  I\r\n\r\nhave  not  pressed  the matter  further  this  year\r\n\r\nbecause I expected the Government would initiate  a\r\n\r\nmove to arouse public interest.

There is no money even to build schools.  A\r\n\r\nstadium  may  be  considered  a  secondary   matter\r\n\r\ncompared  to  schools. What I  want,  Sir,  is  for\r\n\r\nGovernment  to initiate a move as a test  case,  to\r\n\r\nfind  out whether the public are interested or  not\r\n\r\nin  the  establishment of a sports stadium.

What  I  want   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to do is to find out if  there  is  any\r\n\r\nresponse  because the Hon. the Financial  Secretary\r\n\r\nand the Hon. the Chief Minister last year said that\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  response from the public  and  that\r\n\r\nthere  was no necessity to build a sports  stadium.\r\n\r\nSo  what I want now, Sir, is that Government should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninitiate  a  move  first  and  then  wait  for  the\r\n\r\nresponse.  The Singapore Standard started  a  Cheer\r\n\r\nFund  and money came in. Many kinds of relief funds\r\n\r\nwere  started to collect money for this  and  that,\r\n\r\nand  money  came in. So why not we start a  Stadium\r\n\r\nFund and see whether we get any public response? If\r\n\r\nthe   public   are  not  interested   at   all   in\r\n\r\ncontributing money towards this fund, then  let  us\r\n\r\nscrap  the  whole  issue. But  if  the  public  are\r\n\r\ninterested, after Government has initiated  a  move\r\n\r\nto  start  this  fund, then I think the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  take a keen interest in it and  assure  the\r\n\r\npublic  that they will provide a dollar for  dollar\r\n\r\ncontribution  for  the establishment  of  a  sports\r\n\r\nstadium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not like to compare Singapore with the\r\n\r\nFederation, because the Federation has already  got\r\n\r\na  sports stadium. In fact, it was Singapore  which\r\n\r\nfirst  started  the move to have a sports  stadium,\r\n\r\nbut  today the Federation Government can boast that\r\n\r\nthey have a sports stadium first. When the move for\r\n\r\na  fund is initiated, Sir, I will ask Government to\r\n\r\nset  up  a  Board to administer this fund. Sporting\r\n\r\npersonalities such as those who are involved in the\r\n\r\nOlympic  Games,  football or other  games,  can  be\r\n\r\nnominated  to be trustees of this fund.  When  this\r\n\r\nfund  develops to such an extent that the money  is\r\n\r\nsufficient  to  start looking for a  stadium,  then\r\n\r\nonly  let us look for a site. In the meantime,  let\r\n\r\nus  forget about where the site should be,  or  how\r\n\r\nthe  stadium should be built. What we want  is  let\r\n\r\nthe money come in first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will take this into\r\n\r\nconsideration  and  start  a  fund  as  quickly  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon:</b> May I be given permission to\r\n\r\nspeak on this subject also?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I was just going to remark that my\r\n\r\nleniency has caught up with me!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon:</b> Thank you. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nlast year I spoke a lot on the question of reviving\r\n\r\nthe  Stadium Board and I also requested  Government\r\n\r\nto consider having a stadium in Singapore, but I am\r\n\r\nafraid that all this must have fallen on deaf  ears\r\n\r\nbecause nothing has happened since then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me a stadium in Singapore is a necessity, Sir.\r\n\r\nFirst  and foremost, we are known today as a modern\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncity  and practically all the requirements that  we\r\n\r\nneed  for a modern city are here, except a stadium.\r\n\r\nQuite rightly too, as the Member for Queenstown has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmentioned, Government started a move first  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion of having a stadium, but unfortunately  up\r\n\r\nto  this  day nothing has happened at all.  In  the\r\n\r\nFederation, there are now three stadiums: one,  the\r\n\r\nMerdeka Stadium, one in Penang and one in Malacca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been accused in the Press that the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  sports  has generally  gone  down  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  because we have not got the  facilities\r\n\r\nfor international teams or sports organisations  to\r\n\r\ncome  here  and take part in the games.  Without  a\r\n\r\nstadium   the   standard  cannot  improve.   Sports\r\n\r\norganisations  in Singapore have  done  their  bit.\r\n\r\nMoney  was  lacking, but through the enthusiasm  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  members,  they have managed to  do  whatever\r\n\r\nthey  could  to provide sports for the Colony.  But\r\n\r\nGovernment has not given the least encouragement at\r\n\r\nall.  The  only encouragement Government has  shown\r\n\r\nwas  that,  when our teams were going to  the  last\r\n\r\nAsian   Games  and  the  last  Olympic  Games,   it\r\n\r\ncontributed the meagre sum of $25,000. It is  lucky\r\n\r\nfor the Federation of Malaya that they have a Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  who  is  a  great sportsman  and  Cabinet\r\n\r\nMembers  who  are  sports-minded.  They  have   now\r\n\r\napproved  a  vote  of $100,000 to be  utilised  for\r\n\r\nsports activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am still very worried about it. You will\r\n\r\nrealise  that, on the one hand, we are  spending  a\r\n\r\nlot of money to fight subversive elements, but,  on\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, we are not trying  to  stop  them\r\n\r\nbecause we allow the youth of Singapore to go  into\r\n\r\ndance-halls,  cinemas and coffee-shops  instead  of\r\n\r\nspending  their time on the playing  fields.  As  I\r\n\r\nhave said over and over again the question is this.\r\n\r\nAre  the people really interested in sport and  can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe sports stadium be filled? I can say, and I have\r\n\r\nsaid  so  before, that there are at  least  300,000\r\n\r\npeople   in   Singapore  directly   or   indirectly\r\n\r\ninterested  in  sport; and  if  we  have  a  sports\r\n\r\nstadium here and we invite international teams  and\r\n\r\nsports organisations to come here and take part  in\r\n\r\nsports, it will act as an incentive to our athletes\r\n\r\nto  better their standard. As it is now,  they  can\r\n\r\nonly  compete among themselves and the standard  is\r\n\r\nnot  high.  If we have a sports stadium,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nathletes  of Singapore will say, \"We will  have  to\r\n\r\nimprove our standard and put up a good show against\r\n\r\nvisiting teams.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, Sir, I really beg the incoming\r\n\r\nGovernment   to  consider  this  matter  seriously,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  a  good thing  for  the  youth  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to be of sound mind and to have a healthy\r\n\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, eleven years have passed since this\r\n\r\nstadium business first saw the light of day, and my\r\n\r\nrecollection of all the details may not be strictly\r\n\r\naccurate, but I think the basis of what I  now  say\r\n\r\nis accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were interested parties, I think probably\r\n\r\nabout  eight years ago, who thought it would  be  a\r\n\r\nvery  good  thing to have a stadium  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nGovernment  thought that it would  assist  them  to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nform  a stadium if they could show that they had  a\r\n\r\nlarge  measure of public support. An  Ordinance  in\r\n\r\nconnection  with  the creation  of  a  stadium  was\r\n\r\npromulgated.  A Stadium Board was set  up.  It  was\r\n\r\nthen  left to the Board to work out plans  for  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of a stadium. Many years elapsed, but\r\n\r\nthe  Board  was  not able to do  more  despite  the\r\n\r\npromise of land from Government for a site for  the\r\n\r\nstadium. The Stadium Board was able to put up  many\r\n\r\nproposals  for  the stadium, but no proposals  were\r\n\r\nput  up whatsoever for financing the stadium, other\r\n\r\nthan  that Government should put up the money. When\r\n\r\nthe  matter  was  last  discussed  at  considerable\r\n\r\nlength in this Chamber, it was made clear to  those\r\n\r\npeople  who were responsible for the idea  that  if\r\n\r\nthey could show that there was financial support in\r\n\r\nSingapore for a stadium, Government would  be  only\r\n\r\ntoo  prepared to assist. So far, no indication  has\r\n\r\nbeen  given of any desire on the part of the people\r\n\r\nin  Singapore to contribute financially towards the\r\n\r\ncost  of a stadium - and there the matter lies. There\r\n\r\nis  no  need  for Government to start a  fund.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown can start a fund. Or he  can\r\n\r\nstart  the necessary propaganda to start a fund  to\r\n\r\nshow to the Government that the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nare prepared to support financially a stadium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the need for a stadium, we have an\r\n\r\nexcellent stadium at Jalan Besar which, even on its\r\n\r\nbest days, is probably a quarter full. What we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow being asked to do is to put the money to create\r\n\r\na  vast  stadium which will be nothing more than  a\r\n\r\nwhite  elephant.  Perhaps on one occasion  in  four\r\n\r\nyears it may be half full. For the rest of the time\r\n\r\nit will merely be a liability which Government will\r\n\r\nhave to meet from its own resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the statement that there are no\r\n\r\nstadiums  in  Singapore  for  sport,  we  have   an\r\n\r\nexcellent  track  at Farrer Park We  have  numerous\r\n\r\nswimming  pools where people can learn to swim  and\r\n\r\neven  attain  Olympic standards. We  have  numerous\r\n\r\nplaying  fields where the various football  leagues\r\n\r\ncan play their games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the suggestion that a stadium would be\r\n\r\na sound measure to counter subversion, it is merely\r\n\r\na  means  of  encouraging people not to play  games\r\n\r\nthemselves  but  to  attend games - rather  like  the\r\n\r\ncrowd  who  attended  a display  of  gladiators  in\r\n\r\nancient  Rome - and  to  offer  them  facilities  for\r\n\r\nbetting on the outcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if this money were available for a stadium,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would  much prefer to use  it  to  provide\r\n\r\nfacilities for people to play games rather than  to\r\n\r\nwatch 11, 22 or 30 people playing games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospect of getting any international events\r\n\r\nto  be held in Singapore could not take place  more\r\n\r\nthan once in four years at the outside, and only on\r\n\r\nthese occasions would the stadium be full.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, the hon. Members who raised this and\r\n\r\nwho  are so interested in the matter might be  well\r\n\r\nadvised to devote their attention to other matters,\r\n\r\nand  to let this drop. But as I have said, Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthey  can  show beyond a shadow of doubt that  they\r\n\r\ncan  raise  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  $2\r\n\r\nmillion  or  more  required to  create  a  stadium,\r\n\r\nGovernment will be prepared to consider the  matter\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if\r\n\r\nGovernment will make a statement that they will  be\r\n\r\nwilling to provide the land and will be prepared to\r\n\r\ncontribute  a  dollar for a dollar  of  the  public\r\n\r\nsubcription, and to allow the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic to have a voice in the administration of the\r\n\r\nstadium  and share in its profits, I am quite  sure\r\n\r\nit  is  not  mere wishful thinking on my part  that\r\n\r\nthere will be big support for a stadium. I can tell\r\n\r\nthe  House, Sir, that if Government can  give  that\r\n\r\nassurance,  within  one  week  a  hundred  thousand\r\n\r\ndollars will be raised. The question of it being  a\r\n\r\nwhite  elephant  will  not arise  at  all,  because\r\n\r\nholding games there will help to pay for its upkeep\r\n\r\nto  a very great extent; of that I am very definite\r\n\r\nand  certain. To say that the stadium will only  be\r\n\r\nfilled  once  a  year  or once  in  four  years  is\r\n\r\nincorrect.  It is not that only one kind  of  sport\r\n\r\nwill be held there but also other sports too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have today in Singapore, Sir, are only\r\n\r\nplaying  fields.  We have plenty of  them,  but  no\r\n\r\nstadium.  I think the Hon, the Financial  Secretary\r\n\r\ndoes   not   realise  that,  to  invite  teams   of\r\n\r\ninternational  repute to come here, there  must  be\r\n\r\nsome  way. But what is that way? I think next  year\r\n\r\neight  international  soccer teams  are  coming  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  compete. Now, what have  we  got  to\r\n\r\noffer  them? A big city of Singapore with a stadium\r\n\r\nno  better  than Malacca's! I am not talking  about\r\n\r\nthe  Federation capital in Kuala Lumpur, or Penang,\r\n\r\nbut  Malacca.  The Malacca stadium is  much  better\r\n\r\nthan  the playing fields that we have here. Is this\r\n\r\nnot true? I have said we have no real sportsmen  on\r\n\r\nthese  Benches.  The incoming Government,  if  they\r\n\r\nhave  some  Members who are going to be Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Cabinet and who are sports-minded, will, I  am\r\n\r\nsure,  be  a  great help not only to  sportsmen  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  but  to  the City of Singapore,  because\r\n\r\nthen  we will have a place where healthy and clean-living  people can gather together instead of  what\r\n\r\nwe now have - a mixed assortment of clubs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I just want to point out, Sir, that to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the Government gives  the  money  is\r\n\r\nperhaps  short-circuiting the argument.

To attack or  criticise  a\r\n\r\nmember of the Stadium Board is really uncalled  for\r\n\r\nand  unwarranted. I was a member of that Board  and\r\n\r\nit put up several suggestions to the Government. At\r\n\r\nno   time   did  the  Government  ever   think   of\r\n\r\nconsidering   any   suggestions.   The    Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary was also a member of that Board,  and  he\r\n\r\nwas  very  adamant  in  his  attitude  towards  the\r\n\r\nsuggestions  put up. To come here  now  and  attack\r\n\r\nmembers of the Board is nonsense and uncalled  for.\r\n\r\nThis  Board  did put forward suggestions,  but  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment was not in the least interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of funds, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\nasking  the Government to provide funds right  now.\r\n\r\nWhat  I am asking them to do is to start a fund-put\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  to  a  test case, to find out whether there  is\r\n\r\npublic response or not. It may take three years  to\r\n\r\nget  that money; or it may take five years. By that\r\n\r\ntime  a new government will have come in, and there\r\n\r\nmay be an excess of income over expenditure. We may\r\n\r\nhave  a surplus rather than a deficit, and by  that\r\n\r\ntime  the  Government could well provide money  for\r\n\r\nthe Stadium. Why talk about cutting this or cutting\r\n\r\nthat?  If  I  am  insisting that Government  should\r\n\r\nprovide  the  money now, then I will  have  to  put\r\n\r\nforward  suggestions to cut down  the  building  of\r\n\r\nschools or universities, or to increase taxes.

I  do\r\n\r\nnot  want to repeat what I have said last year. The\r\n\r\nJalan  Besar  Stadium and the Farrer  Park  running\r\n\r\ntrack   belong  to  the  City  Council,   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, which is responsible for the running of\r\n\r\nthis  country, cannot even provide a decent stadium\r\n\r\nof international standard.

To say that the stadium\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay be half-full is out of the question. If you  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  a  stadium, how can you attract  foreign\r\n\r\nathletes to come here? If the Olympic Games  should\r\n\r\nbe  held here, would other countries be prepared to\r\n\r\ncome  here if we could not have a stadium  to  hold\r\n\r\nthe  Games? Why say that the stadium may  be  half-full,  or quarter-full, or that it may be  a  white\r\n\r\nelephant? There is no question of it being a  white\r\n\r\nelephant. During certain times of the year, it  can\r\n\r\nbe  opened to schools, organisations, sports clubs,\r\n\r\nand  so  forth. These are the facilities that  will\r\n\r\nattract  them here. We talk of tourism; we talk  of\r\n\r\nattracting tourists to come here. Cannot we attract\r\n\r\nsportsmen  to come here if we have a decent  sports\r\n\r\nstadium?

With the creation of a new department,  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Recreation Division in the Social Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment, I think the Government should  try  and\r\n\r\nbuild  more  community halls for community  centres\r\n\r\nrather than omit this item in the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community centres play a very important part in\r\n\r\nhelping  the  Government  on  many  matters.  These\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  provide  out  of  their   funds\r\n\r\namenities for their own members and they also  help\r\n\r\nthe  Government in many respects, like  health  and\r\n\r\ncitizenship registration. A case of such assistance\r\n\r\nis  seen  in  the recent polio epidemic  where  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres volunteered their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservices  to  register children for  polio  vaccine\r\n\r\nvaccination.  Another case is  the  time  when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   introduced  citizenship  registration.\r\n\r\nMost  of the community centres also offered to help\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Government  in  the  registration  of   alien\r\n\r\ncitizens   for  Singapore  citizenship.  This   has\r\n\r\nrelieved  the Government appreciably. Some  centres\r\n\r\nalso have their own volunteer police to guard their\r\n\r\nareas or estates. This also helps the Police. There\r\n\r\nare   many  other  kinds  of  work  done  by  these\r\n\r\ncommunity centres which help the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at the moment, I understand, three types\r\n\r\nof  community  centres. One  is  sponsored  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  assisted by  the  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment.   The  second  is  sponsored   by   the\r\n\r\nresidents in S.I.T. estates and is provided by  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. with  a  clubhouse at a nominal  rent.  The\r\n\r\nthird type is organized by the residents living  in\r\n\r\nkampongs  or  villages. Now for the first  type  of\r\n\r\ncommunity centre, Government provide money to build\r\n\r\nits  own community hall, and provide furniture  and\r\n\r\nother necessities of the centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second type, the management\r\n\r\ncommittee   has  to  raise  funds  to  upkeep   its\r\n\r\namenities.  In  most cases, some of  these  centres\r\n\r\ncannot be self-sufficient and have to depend on the\r\n\r\nrunning  of open-air cinemas at 10 cents per  head.\r\n\r\nWith this little income these community centres can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanage to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third type of community centre is in kampongs\r\n\r\nor  villages and it does not have any facilities at\r\n\r\nall.  Some of these centres, I understand,  do  not\r\n\r\neven  have a clubhouse. Such a centre can be  found\r\n\r\nin West Coast Road. They have to function within  a\r\n\r\nChinese temple. This is not right, Sir, because  it\r\n\r\nis   the   responsibility  and  the  duty  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to provide community halls so  that  the\r\n\r\nresidents living in the area could gather together.\r\n\r\nexchange  views  or  to create a  closer  community\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeeling.  I do hope that the Government  will  look\r\n\r\ninto  this matter seriously and try and assist,  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  possible, the underprivileged - I term  them\r\n\r\nunderprivileged  because  most  of  them  are   not\r\n\r\nassisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have every sympathy\r\n\r\nfor  the  hon.

I have  seen\r\n\r\nthe  Report of the Estimates Committee for the year\r\n\r\n1957.  In it the then Director of Public Works  was\r\n\r\nasked  for  his opinion about the houses  built  by\r\n\r\nIdeal  Homes in Whitley Road. His reply, Sir,  was,\r\n\r\n\"If  I had $30,000 I would rather throw it into the\r\n\r\nSingapore  River  than buy one  of  those  houses.\"\r\n\r\nThese  were exactly his words. I did not  fabricate\r\n\r\nthem  myself. Such was the attitude of  the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks Department officers, and I believe it is  the\r\n\r\nopinion  of the public officers now. If  these  are\r\n\r\nthe type of people who really have no intention  of\r\n\r\ntrying  to cut down expenditure for the Government,\r\n\r\nthen  how can we expect them to reduce the cost?  A\r\n\r\nlot of building schemes have been put up in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimates  which are very much more expensive  than\r\n\r\nthose put up by the public. Sir, there are so  many\r\n\r\nreasons. The Estimates could be very high,  or  the\r\n\r\ncost  also  could have been very high. One  reason,\r\n\r\nSir, is the corruption of the officers concerned. I\r\n\r\nam  not accusing anybody because I have no evidence\r\n\r\nto  show that the officers are corrupted. Secondly,\r\n\r\nit  is  that they put up too luxurious  a  type  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  to suit circumstances and needs. Thirdly,\r\n\r\nthey  specify  a  lot of expensive materials  which\r\n\r\nshould  never be there. When I criticised the  cost\r\n\r\nof the Polytechnic last year, I was asked by one of\r\n\r\nthe members of the Board of Governors to go and see\r\n\r\nthe  opening  of  the tenders.  I  refused  to  go,\r\n\r\nbecause  by looking at the opening of the  tenders,\r\n\r\nit  would only satisfy me that the tenders were not\r\n\r\nmade up specially for the occasion. What I mean  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  tenders were properly sent  in  and  not\r\n\r\nsubstituted later. But I had never any intention of\r\n\r\nseeing  it,  and  it  was  never  my  intention  to\r\n\r\ncriticise  the  Polytechnic  costs  on  account  of\r\n\r\nunderhand  methods of tendering. As  I  have  said,\r\n\r\nSir,  there are many reasons that could put up  the\r\n\r\ncost of a building: for instance, like putting a $3 - finish  to  a  block of flats at Leonie  Hill;  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  of  putting brass hinges  in  servants'\r\n\r\nquarters,  because I have examined a  copy  of  the\r\n\r\nspecification  of one of the jobs. I have  designed\r\n\r\nmany buildings of millionaires, and I have not even\r\n\r\non  one  occasion  put  brass hinges  in  servants'\r\n\r\nquarters.  The cost of brass hinges  is  about  ten\r\n\r\ntimes  that  of steel hinges. If the  brass  hinges\r\n\r\nlast  twenty years, and the steel hinges last  only\r\n\r\ntwo  years, then I would say the cost is justified.\r\n\r\nI  know  very  well, Sir, that a  door  with  steel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhinges  will definitely last as long as  that  with\r\n\r\nbrass  hinges.  So why push up the cost  ten  times\r\n\r\nhigher? Is there any justification for it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time we criticise the Public Works\r\n\r\nDepartment for the high cost of building, they  say\r\n\r\nit  is because their buildings are much better than\r\n\r\nthose  built  by people outside. But  have  we  any\r\n\r\nevidence  to substantiate such statements  made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry?  If  people can  build  a  flat  for\r\n\r\n$15,000 and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment's flat costs $45,000, there is something\r\n\r\nwrong  with  the Government. But have  they,  after\r\n\r\nhaving inspected the flats and schools built by the\r\n\r\npublic at one-third the cost, come back and made  a\r\n\r\nreport  on  how  much difference there  is  in  the\r\n\r\ncosts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, they can do no wrong. The white men can do\r\n\r\nno  wrong.  The  devils are only  the  Asians.  The\r\n\r\ndevils are the Members who come and complain in the\r\n\r\nHouse. That is the kind of attitude adopted by  the\r\n\r\nMinister   and  his  colleagues - when  I   say   his\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  I mean his subordinates.  So  how  can\r\n\r\nthey expect to cut down the cost of buildings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the cost of P.W.D. building is 20 per cent or\r\n\r\n30 per cent higher, for instance, we can understand\r\n\r\nthat;  but  if  it is 200 per cent  higher  and  no\r\n\r\nexplanation  is  given whatsoever  except  to  say,\r\n\r\n\"Our's   is   the  best!\" - are  the   Public   Works\r\n\r\nDepartment  buildings the best? Even  if  they  are\r\n\r\nslightly  better  than  others,  are  their   costs\r\n\r\ncheaper than others? Definitely not!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said about the Polytechnic, the\r\n\r\nsquandering  of  public funds must stop,  and  stop\r\n\r\nnow.  If  the Minister thinks that he is unable  to\r\n\r\nset  up  an  inquiry, or bring  down  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nbuildings, then I think he should not stay  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

The selection of unemployment relief\r\n\r\nrecruitment  is done by the Labour Ministry,  which\r\n\r\nhas  the  appropriate facilities, and I  would  not\r\n\r\nwish to attempt to outline the methods there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand there has been some difficulty in\r\n\r\nfilling  some of the projects initially  when  they\r\n\r\nwere  seeking to recruit in the rural  areas  where\r\n\r\nthe  works are to be carried out. The tendency  has\r\n\r\nbeen  to give more employment to people in the town\r\n\r\nand move them out to the rural areas where work has\r\n\r\nto   be  done.  The  works  in  hand  so  far   are\r\n\r\nimprovement of rural roads and tracks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Serangoon will be happy to\r\n\r\nnote that some work is starting on the Yio Chu Kang\r\n\r\nRoad improvements. It is not the sector in which he\r\n\r\nis  interested. There will be some very large-scale\r\n\r\nwork  in connection with the runway at the Airport.\r\n\r\nI  think  I  better not prejudice  other  works  by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreferring  to them ahead of the time at which  they\r\n\r\ngo  into operation, since the developments  are  to\r\n\r\nsome  extent conditioned by the experience obtained\r\n\r\nas the work goes forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Serangoon referred to the need\r\n\r\nfor   improvements  of  Yio  Chu  Kang   Road   or,\r\n\r\nalternatively, for some other roads to be  made  up\r\n\r\nto  get  the  quite heavy traffic out of  Serangoon\r\n\r\nGarden  Estate for those who want to get  into  the\r\n\r\nCity.  I  have  been living just  beyond  Serangoon\r\n\r\nGarden Estate now for about eight months and I have\r\n\r\nhad the opportunity of experiencing traffic on this\r\n\r\nroad.  It  is certainly a very inadequate road  for\r\n\r\nthe  load  of traffic it has to carry, particularly\r\n\r\nremembering the children, pedestrians, and bicycles\r\n\r\nin addition to the motor-car traffic and the buses.\r\n\r\nBut  I must remind the hon. Member that this  is  a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter  for  the local authorities.  The  money  is\r\n\r\nprovided  to  the Rural Board from the  Government,\r\n\r\nbut  the  decision and the action  rests  with  the\r\n\r\nlocal  authorities.  It  is  up  to  them  to  give\r\n\r\ninstructions to the executive engineer to carry out\r\n\r\nthe works. It is not for me to take upon myself  to\r\n\r\ninstruct  the local authorities as to what decision\r\n\r\nthey should take.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can perhaps cheer his anxious heart by telling\r\n\r\nhim that in the months after I had moved into that\r\n\r\narea,  I  did take the trouble to time my  journey\r\n\r\nfrom  my house to my office. I filled up one  page\r\n\r\nof  my notebook - 16 journeys. From the door of  the\r\n\r\nhouse  to  just beyond the traffic lights  at  the\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar police station is one mile,  and  that\r\n\r\nmile took me the following times:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 minutes 15 seconds; 3\ufffd minutes; 2 minutes 50\r\n\r\nseconds;  2  minutes  45  seconds;  3  minutes  20\r\n\r\nseconds;  3  minutes  50  seconds;  3  minutes  30\r\n\r\nseconds;  3  minutes  20  seconds;  3  minutes  25  seconds;  4  minutes   5\r\n\r\nseconds;  3  minutes  45  seconds;  3  minutes   5\r\n\r\nseconds; 2 minutes 20 seconds; and 7 minutes and 5\r\n\r\nseconds-that was when part of the road was up  and\r\n\r\nthere was a considerable block.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget precisely what the average speed comes\r\n\r\nto, but it is obviously between 15 and 20 miles an\r\n\r\nhour  over a one-mile stretch, and there  are  two\r\n\r\ntraffic  lights to be negotiated. So the  road  is\r\n\r\nnot an excessively slow-moving road on an average.\r\n\r\nIf  the unhappy motorist finds himself behind  two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  three buses, all of them stopping at  all  the\r\n\r\nbus  stops, he will have a very exasperating  time\r\n\r\nindeed.  But,  nevertheless,  the  average  of  my\r\n\r\nfigures is not a too discreditable average.  I  am\r\n\r\nmore  concerned  personally about  the  danger  to\r\n\r\nhuman  life,  or the difficulty to the  public  in\r\n\r\ngetting  across the road without excessive danger.\r\n\r\nThe  children, the hawkers and the people  who  do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot own motor cars come much nearer to my heart in\r\n\r\nthis  matter than the motor-car owner  who  loses,\r\n\r\nperhaps, two minutes of his life in traversing one\r\n\r\nmile.
