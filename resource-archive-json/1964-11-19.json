Otherwise an\r\n\r\nincrease  in the regular labour force for an occasional overflow\r\n\r\nof  work would mean a redundancy problem when the volume of work\r\n\r\nreturns to normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one particular case, the regular labour force expressed\r\n\r\naversion  to  the work of removal of sludge in the  Ulu  Pandan\r\n\r\nSewerage  Disposal  Works because of the unpleasant  smell,  and\r\n\r\nasked to be taken off these duties. This work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\nhas therefore been given out to contract since the end of 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in certain fields of unskilled labour such as grass\r\n\r\ncutting,  planting of grass along road sides and side tables  of\r\n\r\nroads,  the  efficiency  of the regular labour  force  is  being\r\n\r\nchecked  against  work allocated on contracts in  order  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether   departmental  labour  is  keeping  up  its   rate   of\r\n\r\nproductivity.  There has been a tendency in the  regular  labour\r\n\r\nforce  to slow down the pace of work in order to create overtime\r\n\r\non  public  holidays  and Sundays. If this trend  persists,  the\r\n\r\nproductivity of the regular labour force will become  lower  and\r\n\r\nlower and finally ludicrously uneconomic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem is now widespread in all Government Departments\r\n\r\nwhere  overtime can be created by slowing down the pace of work.\r\n\r\nThe  Government is having a committee to look into  this  matter\r\n\r\nwith a view to removing the temptation to slow down productivity\r\n\r\nin  order to create overtime. Unless this problem is solved, the\r\n\r\ndisparity  between  departmental labour  and  work  let  out  on\r\n\r\ncontract will make it absurd for the Government to continue  its\r\n\r\npresent  policy of high daily wages at the minimum of $4.55  per\r\n\r\nday  for  unskilled labour, with double and treble overtime  for\r\n\r\nSundays and public holidays. The Government is sure that most of\r\n\r\nits  union  leaders are keen to protect their honest  and \r\n\r\nhard-working  members and will want to eradicate malpractices \r\n\r\nleading to   deliberate  malingering  and  absenteeism.Absenteeism  is\r\n\r\nsometimes as high as 25 per cent on a week day and as low  as  3\r\n\r\nper  cent on a public holiday when treble pay obtains.  In  some\r\n\r\ncases, drivers of lorries have earned as much as $380 per  month\r\n\r\nand  workers  have  earned  more than  $200  per  month  through\r\n\r\nartificially  created  overtime giving them  incomes  more  than\r\n\r\ntheir supervisors. This problem has become more and more vicious\r\n\r\nover the last six to seven years. A possible solution would seem\r\n\r\nto  lie, as in the case of the Singapore Port Authority, in  the\r\n\r\nabolition  of overtime through the introduction of shift  duties\r\n\r\nat rates of pay which guarantee that the total\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake-home pay will be at least 26 days full wages per month  for\r\n\r\neach worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will be discussing this matter with the unions\r\n\r\nto  work  out a solution which will do justice not only  to  the\r\n\r\nhonest and industrious workers but also to the tax-payers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigues (Telok Blangah)</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

On the  one\r\n\r\nhand, we are trying to do our very best to expedite the work  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government; and on the other hand, there is a request  here\r\n\r\nwhich says, why did I not consult the trade union? It would have\r\n\r\ntaken  me  at least six months to get an answer from them  if  I\r\n\r\nwere  to  consult them whether contract labour could be used  or\r\n\r\nnot.

Such\r\n\r\ncomplaints have been ventilated in the Press from time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  time,  the architects' profession have openly clamoured  for\r\n\r\nsome  form  of regulation of building construction so  that  the\r\n\r\nrelationship  between  the  developer  and  house  purchaser  is\r\n\r\nproperly  set  out,  and  even  certain  members  of  the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession  have  been alarmed at the very  one-sided  contracts\r\n\r\nwhich house purchasers have to enter into with the developer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One may well ask why, in a system such as we have in Singapore,\r\n\r\nany  government interference with the laws of demand and  supply\r\n\r\nis  necessary. The answer is simple. While the Government  tries\r\n\r\nto  satisfy  the housing necessity of the lower and lower-middle\r\n\r\nincome groups by providing public housing for sale or for  rent,\r\n\r\nit  has always been assumed that the private sector will provide\r\n\r\nfor   those  who  would  wish  to  live  in  better   types   of\r\n\r\naccommodation  than  those provided at  public  expense.  Hence,\r\n\r\nwhile we are aware that 14,000 to 16,000 units of housing may be\r\n\r\nrequired  each year, our efforts have been directed to supplying\r\n\r\nonly 10,000 to 12,000 units annually, leaving the remaining\r\n\r\none-third  or  so  to  be  supplied by private enterprise.  This  is\r\n\r\nhealthy  in so far as the State should not have the monopoly  of\r\n\r\nproviding housing, private enterprise should participate in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our city areas, and better type of housing should\r\n\r\nbe built at the same time as low cost housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, because of shortage of land, varying building\r\n\r\nconditions and the upward trend of prices of building materials,\r\n\r\nthere   are   many  uncertainties  in  the  housing  development\r\n\r\nbusiness.    While   certain   well   established    development\r\n\r\norganisations  with  proper  financial  backing  and  managerial\r\n\r\nexperience are able to cope with the changing situation  and  to\r\n\r\ndeliver  the  goods  in accordance with the terms  of  agreement\r\n\r\nentered   into  with  the  purchaser,  the  existence  of   such\r\n\r\nuncertainties  has  given birth to a spate of  mushroom  housing\r\n\r\ndevelopers  who use every opportunity to make quick  profits  at\r\n\r\nthe expense of the house purchaser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  a  situation where the purchaser is acutely aware  that  the\r\n\r\nlimited amount of money he has to purchase a house\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmight  soon  be  insufficient due  to  rising  land  prices  and\r\n\r\nbuilding costs, it is not surprising that he will be prepared to\r\n\r\nenter  into agreements which are so patently one-sided and  most\r\n\r\ndisadvantageous  to  him. Many of these agreements  provide  for\r\n\r\nrefunds  of deposit to the purchaser without any special reason;\r\n\r\nincrease in the price of the property to be purchased;  no  time\r\n\r\nlimit  for  the completion of the house; a free hand in  varying\r\n\r\nthe  materials to be used and in the alterations to the detailed\r\n\r\nplans; and various additional items of expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of such unscrupulous practices by certain\r\n\r\ndevelopers,  many house purchasers have been properly  swindled.\r\n\r\nIn  the  eyes of the law, there is little they can do  about  it\r\n\r\nbecause the agreement they have entered into is perfectly legal.\r\n\r\nSuch  purchasers have, therefore, little redress; they  can,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  withdraw  and have their money back, often  many  years\r\n\r\nafter  paying the initial deposit, but by that time land  prices\r\n\r\nand  prices of properties would have gone up to such  an  extent\r\n\r\nthat he would feel properly cheated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the speculative developer, it is clear that he\r\n\r\nhas no intention of delivering the goods early; what he wants is\r\n\r\nto make use of the purchaser's money for as long as possible. He\r\n\r\nenters  into a series of land speculations, promising  flats  or\r\n\r\nhomes  for  one set of purchasers after another,  while  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime either acquiring, mortgaging and re-mortgaging whatever\r\n\r\nland he has got in the hope of cashing in on rising land values,\r\n\r\nor  if  land  values do not rise fast enough,  using  the  money\r\n\r\ncollected as deposits for other types of business. All  this  is\r\n\r\nmost unhealthy for the economy of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this legislation now before the House is to\r\n\r\ngive  a  certain  amount  of protection to  the  innocent  house\r\n\r\npurchaser  by preventing the excesses of the building developers\r\n\r\nand  by bringing all housing developers under the proper control\r\n\r\nof Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long term, the other more important purpose of this Bill\r\n\r\nis  to  ensure  that  we encourage the establishment  of  proper\r\n\r\nhousing  developers who will contribute their share  to  the  re-development of the City of Singapore. As you know, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  are  now going in a big way into the problems  of  the\r\n\r\nlarge scale re-development of our City. The Government does  not\r\n\r\nintend  to  do, and cannot do, all the re-development  but  will\r\n\r\nwelcome  private  participation. In fact, it is  the  considered\r\n\r\nview  of  the  Government that every effort should  be  made  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the greater part, if not all of the re-development\r\n\r\nof  our  City, should be done by private enterprise.  The  State\r\n\r\nwill  only  ensure  that the conditions  of  urban  renewal  are\r\n\r\ncongenial  for private participation. It will acquire the  land,\r\n\r\ndo  away with fragmented ownership, provide for the resettlement\r\n\r\nof  existing  tenants,  rehousing them in new  housing  estates,\r\n\r\nreplan the area on a comprehensive basis and make available \r\n\r\nsizeable  plots to private enterprises to develop in accordance with\r\n\r\na pre-planned pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that this can come about, there must exist in the\r\n\r\nState sufficient development organisation and institutions  with\r\n\r\nthe  proper financial backing and managerial experience to  make\r\n\r\nserious large-scale capital investments. There will not  be  any\r\n\r\nplace  for unscrupulous speculators and opportunists. Hence  the\r\n\r\nneed  now  to weed out such opportunists in order to foster  the\r\n\r\nhealthy   growth   of   sound  development  organisations.   The\r\n\r\nexperience gained in developing houses for sale will go  a  long\r\n\r\nway  towards  training  these developers in  the  techniques  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment for long term investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House will seek to enforce control over\r\n\r\nthe  operations  of  building  developers.  It  lays  down  that\r\n\r\ndevelopers, whether a company or individual or partnership,  can\r\n\r\nonly  operate  with sufficient capital under a licence.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  a company, it must have a paid up capital of not  less\r\n\r\nthan $500,000, and in the case of a partnership or individual, a\r\n\r\ndeposit of $100,000 will have to be made with the Controller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Controller to be appointed under the Bill will be vested\r\n\r\nwith  wide  powers. He may, at any time after  the  grant  of  a\r\n\r\nlicence, vary or revoke any conditions of the licence or  impose\r\n\r\nconditions  or additional conditions on the licence.  There  is,\r\n\r\nhowever,  a  provision for appeal to the Minister  in  any  case\r\n\r\nwhere  the  developer  is dissatisfied  by  the  action  of  the\r\n\r\nController. The use of the words \"Housing Developers\"  will  now\r\n\r\nbe  regulated,  and  no one can now carry  on  the  business  of\r\n\r\nhousing development without a licence. Stringent control will be\r\n\r\napplied  on  housing  developers  and  every  licensee  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  exhibit in his office a copy of his  last  audited\r\n\r\nbalance  sheet and the full names and particulars of all persons\r\n\r\nwho are in control and management' of the business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housing developer will be required to appoint an auditor to\r\n\r\nmake  a  report upon his annual balance sheet and accounts,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Controller  is  furthermore empowered  to  investigate  the\r\n\r\nbooks,  accounts  and  transactions of  the  developer,  or  the\r\n\r\nMinister may order the Controller or an Inspector to investigate\r\n\r\ninto   the  affairs  of  a  licensed  housing  developer.  Where\r\n\r\npurchasers   are  dissatisfied,  the  Minister  can   order   an\r\n\r\ninvestigation  into the affairs of a licensed housing  developer\r\n\r\nif an application is made by not less than five purchasers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain circumstances, such as a housing developer being\r\n\r\nunable  to meet his obligations, or if he conducts his  business\r\n\r\nin  a manner detrimental to the purchasers or the public, or  if\r\n\r\nhe  informs  the  Controller that  he  is  unable  to  meet  his\r\n\r\nobligations,  the  Minister may direct a  company  or  board  to\r\n\r\nassume control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will empower the Minister to make rules for the\r\n\r\npurposes  of  the  Ordinance in such matters as  regulating  the\r\n\r\nadvertisements  of the housing developer, the use  of  names  of\r\n\r\nhousing  estates,  the  payments and  deposits  to  be  made  by\r\n\r\npurchasers  at various stages of construction of the house,  the\r\n\r\nforms of contracts to be used by the housing developer, and  the\r\n\r\nconditions in the contract which, if used, will be void.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a prohibition in the Bill to prevent a person, who\r\n\r\nbecomes bankrupt, or suspends his payments or compounds with his\r\n\r\ncreditors,  or  if he is convicted of an offence  involving  dishonesty or fraud, from being a director, manager or secretary of\r\n\r\na licensed housing developer company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister will be empowered to exempt any person, group of\r\n\r\npersons, society, company or statutory board from the provisions\r\n\r\nof the Ordinance. There are also transitional provisions for the\r\n\r\nlicensing of housing developers who were in business before  1st\r\n\r\nNovember, 1964, and who may not be in a position to comply fully\r\n\r\nwith  the requirements of the Bill. In such circumstances,  when\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  becomes law, they may be granted provisional  licence\r\n\r\nwith or without conditions, for a period which may extend up  to\r\n\r\nfive years, and which may be revoked at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting this legislation, careful consideration has been\r\n\r\ngiven  to  all  the complaints that have been  received  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  as well as those made in the Press. I would also  wish\r\n\r\nto  thank  the  Bar  Committee for making  suggestions  for  the\r\n\r\nformulation  of  the  principles of this  Bill.

There are, of course,  many\r\n\r\ndecent  business  men  who develop housing  estates,  and  their\r\n\r\nservice to society is acknowledged as an effective corollary  to\r\n\r\nthe Government's policy of providing decent living standards for\r\n\r\nthe people. Over the past few years,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Government has concentrated on building flats for the people\r\n\r\nin  the lower income group because this is the group that really\r\n\r\nneeds  Government assistance. This has left people in the middle\r\n\r\nand  upper  income groups to look to private housing  developers\r\n\r\nfor  houses.  Once a man's combined family income  is  up  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  $800  per month, it is left to himself  to  find  a\r\n\r\nhouse.  But  this  does not mean that he must  be  left  to  the\r\n\r\nwolves.  Many  of these people, especially in the middle  income\r\n\r\ngroup,  are  ordinary working people who dream of  purchasing  a\r\n\r\nhouse. They sweat and toil to save enough money at least for the\r\n\r\ninitial  deposit  for a house, foregoing many  of  the  ordinary\r\n\r\npleasures  of  life.  When  they are exploited  by  unscrupulous\r\n\r\ndevelopers, their dream of a house of their own is shattered and\r\n\r\nthe attendant hardships are of some magnitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not allow racketeers disguised in the name of housing\r\n\r\ndevelopers  to  rob  the fruits of prosperity  of  our  society.\r\n\r\nProsperity must be shared. So is the wealth of our country.  The\r\n\r\ncommon  man has every right to expect a decent house of his  own\r\n\r\nand  to  lead  a  decent life. We must not allow  racketeers  to\r\n\r\nfrustrate  his  hopes. And if racketeers make  false  plans  and\r\n\r\npromises  to rob them of their hard-earned savings,  it  is  the\r\n\r\nduty of the Government to suppress these racketeers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few racketeers in the housing business are nothing more\r\n\r\nthan  harmful parasites who live on the sufferings  of  innocent\r\n\r\npeople. They have probably no land, no concrete plans, and  even\r\n\r\nno  business  capital. Newspaper advertisements  and  flamboyant\r\n\r\nbrochures  and  pamphlets are published to  lure  deposits  from\r\n\r\ninnocent  buyers. The deposits so made constitute their  working\r\n\r\ncapital with which they purchase land, not with the intention of\r\n\r\nbuilding  houses  thereon  immediately,  but  with  an  eye   to\r\n\r\nspeculative profit. They wait for some time until the  price  of\r\n\r\nland increases and then notify the people who have booked houses\r\n\r\nthat in the light of the increased price of land,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  increased price over that originally agreed must be paid for\r\n\r\nthe house, and in some cases they even return the deposit, after\r\n\r\nhaving  made  money  out of the accumulated deposits,  with  the\r\n\r\ntrite excuse that the booking has been cancelled. In some cases,\r\n\r\na  transfer fee in addition to the deposit is demanded and  when\r\n\r\nthe  frustrated buyer finally demands back the deposit, he  gets\r\n\r\nit,  but not the transfer fee. If the buyer, on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nhad deposited the money in a bank he would have earned interest,\r\n\r\nbut when caught in the web of these racketeers he not only loses\r\n\r\nhis transfer fee but the interest that he would have earned. The\r\n\r\nracketeer  has  always the upper hand - he  tosses  the  coin  and\r\n\r\nconfidently  expects to call always \"Heads,  I  win,  tails  you\r\n\r\nlose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the shrewder ones, however, give an appearance of\r\n\r\nlegitimacy. They make the price attractively low to lure buyers,\r\n\r\nbut  what  the  unsuspecting buyer does not  know  is  that  the\r\n\r\ndeveloper  has  deliberately excluded from the price  he  quotes\r\n\r\nvery  important  items such as septic tank,  electrical  cables,\r\n\r\netc.  When the house nears completion, and the buyer is  already\r\n\r\nfirmly  committed, the developer confronts the buyer for  a  few\r\n\r\nthousand  dollars more for the laying of cables or  installation\r\n\r\nof  a septic tank, and so on. What can the buyer do but pay  the\r\n\r\nadditional  amount  demanded, for he  cannot  live  in  a  house\r\n\r\nwithout  basic necessities like lighting and modern  sanitation?\r\n\r\nIt  is sad to say that today there are already some house buyers\r\n\r\nwho  are in a very ridiculous and pitiful position; living in  a\r\n\r\nmodern house without modern sanitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know of developers who, in the final stages of\r\n\r\nbuilding,  suddenly tell the buyers that they have to  pay  more\r\n\r\nthan  the agreed price on the pretext that prices have generally\r\n\r\nincreased.  In a few instances, resolute buyers have  joined  to\r\n\r\nresist such developers with some measure of success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now cite cases of housing companies which have caused\r\n\r\nhardship to house-buyers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first case I would like to cite is that involving the\r\n\r\nJurong  Park  Limited at No. 38 Jurong Road,  8\u00bc  milestone.  In\r\n\r\n1962,  this  company published advertisements in the  newspapers\r\n\r\nannouncing  its  proposed housing estate.  These  advertisements\r\n\r\nattracted  many  school  headmasters  and  teachers  in  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools  in  the Jurong area because it presented them  with  an\r\n\r\nexcellent  opportunity to obtain adequate housing  accommodation\r\n\r\nclose  to  their place of work. Many of them booked houses,  but\r\n\r\nmore  than  2\u00bd years have elapsed since then, and the estate  is\r\n\r\nnot  even in its first phase of building programme. I also  know\r\n\r\nof  one  particular person, a friend of mine, who  had  dealings\r\n\r\nwith  this same company. He was so eager to get a house in  this\r\n\r\nestate  that he paid $2,500 to the company as a transfer fee  to\r\n\r\nbook  one  and, in addition, he paid $1,000 as initial  deposit.\r\n\r\nHis  hopes, however, were doomed to despair for, when  6  months\r\n\r\nlater  he  visited the site, he found to his consternation  that\r\n\r\nthe  site remained nothing more than the original wasteland that\r\n\r\nit was. There was no sign of building, not even a bulldozer or a\r\n\r\nbuilding contractor's temporary office. He, therefore, wrote  to\r\n\r\nthe company asking when the house would be complete. The company\r\n\r\nreturned  him  the deposit of $1,000 he had paid, informing  him\r\n\r\nthat  his booking had been cancelled and that he would  have  to\r\n\r\nlook  for a house elsewhere. The same letter also threatened  to\r\n\r\ntake  legal action against him for sending copies of his  letter\r\n\r\nto  the  Government. There was no mention of the $2,500  he  had\r\n\r\npaid  as a transfer fee to book the house; it would appear  that\r\n\r\nthis amount had vanished, not into thin air as would commonly be\r\n\r\nsaid, but, I am sure, into the pockets of someone in the company\r\n\r\nand permanently lost to the person who paid\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second case involves the Singapore Trading Company,\r\n\r\nLimited,  of  Nos.  4 and 4-1 Collyer Quay,  which  has  several\r\n\r\nbuilding projects in Singapore. I am mentioning only one housing\r\n\r\nestate  in particular, namely the Hillview Estate which is  also\r\n\r\nin the Jurong area. About the middle of 1961, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  Trading Company, Limited, advertised in  the  Press\r\n\r\nabout  this estate. They also printed a pamphlet giving  details\r\n\r\nof  their  scheme and inviting applications. They  called  it  a\r\n\r\n\"Save  $5  to  own a house\" scheme. In my view, this  is  highly\r\n\r\nsuspect. However, this is a small point and I do not propose  to\r\n\r\ngo   further  into  it.  The  pamphlet  asked  people  who  were\r\n\r\ninterested  in  the  scheme to apply to  the  Singapore  Trading\r\n\r\nCompany, Limited. But when they did apply and, after several discussions, decided to buy such a house, surprisingly enough  they\r\n\r\nwere  asked  to sign the usual agreement not with the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTrading Company, Limited, but with an entirely different company\r\n\r\ncalled  the  Popular Estates Limited. Though I am  not  familiar\r\n\r\nwith  this  sort of thing, it appears odd to me  that  one  firm\r\n\r\nshould offer houses for sale and another firm should be a  party\r\n\r\nto  the  agreement. It would seem to me that this is a  ruse  to\r\n\r\noutwit  the  purchasers  because the company  that  offered  the\r\n\r\nhouses  for  sale cannot be held responsible if the houses  were\r\n\r\nnot  built  according to the original specifications printed  in\r\n\r\nthe  pamphlet.  This would give the second company,  the  actual\r\n\r\nparty  to  the  transaction,  an opening  to  sell  houses  very\r\n\r\ndifferent from the original specifications, and the buyer  would\r\n\r\nhave  no  legal  right  of remedy against  either  company.  The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Trading  Company, Limited, and  the  Popular  Estates\r\n\r\nLimited  are,  however, in the same premises  and  the  Managing\r\n\r\nDirector  of both these firms is one called Seah Boon Heng.  Mr\r\n\r\nSeah very recently made a generous donation to the building fund\r\n\r\nof  the  St. John's Ambulance Brigade and thereby obtained  some\r\n\r\npublicity  in  the  Press as a philanthropist.  If  the  harvest\r\n\r\nreaped by racketeering is transformed into a donation and  makes\r\n\r\nthe donor a philanthropist, may we be spared in future from such\r\n\r\na travesty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come back to the Hillview Estate in Jurong. Three years\r\n\r\nhave passed but the Hillview Estate is hardly in the first phase\r\n\r\nof  building activity. The worried and indignant purchasers have\r\n\r\njoined forces and formed an \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassociation   to   protect  themselves  against  the  unscrupulous\r\n\r\ndevelopers. I commend them for the action that they have  taken.\r\n\r\nAccordingly,  the  Hillview Estate House  Owners  and  Residents\r\n\r\nAssociation was registered on 15th July, 1964, as a society.  On\r\n\r\n1st  of June, 1964, three years after the purchase agreement was\r\n\r\nsigned and when the Association was still in its pro-tem stage,\r\n\r\nthe  pro-tem  Secretary issued a circular to its  members,  the\r\n\r\ncontents  of  which will clearly signify their plight.  I  quote\r\n\r\nbelow a few significant paragraphs. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Vendor [that means the Company] in his last letter dated\r\n\r\n26th  February, 1964, assured us that the whole project  was  expected to the completed within the next five months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then three good months have passed and there seems to be\r\n\r\nno  sign of completion even after the lapse of five months. Work\r\n\r\nseems  to be in progress, but only at a very slow unsteady pace,\r\n\r\nwhich  could mean that the target date could be dragged  on  for\r\n\r\nanother year or so.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was three years after the purchase agreement was signed.\r\n\r\nIt went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We also note from our inspection of the site that the Car\r\n\r\nPorch is not in accordance with the requirements. The drive  way\r\n\r\nto  the  Porch  is  at a very bad angle in practically  all  the\r\n\r\nhouses. We have, therefore, insisted to the vendor that  at  all\r\n\r\ncosts the drive way must be flat or parallel to the ground.  You\r\n\r\ncould   undoubtedly   expect   a   further   delay   over   this\r\n\r\nrepresentation.  Nevertheless,  we  expect  to  attain  our  aim\r\n\r\npatiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter dated 28th May, 1964, has been received by all\r\n\r\nhouse-owners  from the vendor recommending that house-owners  consider\r\n\r\nto build on their own retaining walls in front, back and side of\r\n\r\nour  land,  which  we are aware will cost well over  a  thousand\r\n\r\ndollars.  This  extra unnecessary expenditure  could  have  been\r\n\r\navoided had the developer taken greater care while planning  the\r\n\r\nsite. We have no intention of suffering over-errors committed by\r\n\r\nthe  developer.  Moreover,  there is  nothing  specific  in  our\r\n\r\nagreement to the effect that such expenditure must be  borne  by\r\n\r\nhouse-owners.  Therefore,  the Committee  has  decided  to  seek\r\n\r\nfurther legal advice to put such shortcomings right.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the common plight faced by the house purchasers who fell\r\n\r\ninto  the merciless grip of these sharks in the building  trade.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, however, the law is used to tie up the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurchasers  in  what  is almost always a one-side  agreement  in\r\n\r\nwhich,  unfortunately enough, lawyers play the vital  role,  and\r\n\r\nthe purchasers are at the receiving end. The law, of course,  is\r\n\r\nan  honourable profession and it is most unfortunate that in the\r\n\r\nname of the law dishonourable documents are drawn up to fix  the\r\n\r\ninnocent buyers. Because the legal requirements are met in these\r\n\r\ndocuments,   it  is  almost  impossible  to  bring  unscrupulous\r\n\r\ndevelopers  to court if they failed to fulfil their obligations.\r\n\r\nThe  documents  are framed in such a way that the  developer  is\r\n\r\ncompletely  free to change specifications, raise the  price  and\r\n\r\nuse any material he likes, and it is more than likely that these\r\n\r\nwould  be  inferior ones. There are possibly other ramifications\r\n\r\nin  this  type  of  racketeering but, because  I  have  not  got\r\n\r\nsufficient information on them, I do not propose to go into them\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of legislation to curb and control housing\r\n\r\ndevelopers  and  to  protect home buyers, a fertile  field  will\r\n\r\nexist for avaricious developers. Like vicious man-eating sharks,\r\n\r\nthey  always hunt for their prey. The Government has, therefore,\r\n\r\na duty to protect society from them. A firm line has to be drawn\r\n\r\nbetween legitimate business and bubble. The bubble must  not  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  form and if already formed we must  take  steps  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the public is protected before the bubble  bursts.\r\n\r\nLegitimate  business  serves  a  useful  purpose  in   that   it\r\n\r\ncontributes  to economic and social development but the  bubble,\r\n\r\non  the other hand, lives on the sufferings of the people and is\r\n\r\ntherefore absolutely anti-social.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other instances and I hope members of the\r\n\r\npublic,  especially  the purchasers, who are  victims  of  these\r\n\r\nbuilding  sharks, will come forward to give information  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  Controller  to  be  appointed  under  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  so  that remedial action can be taken against  these\r\n\r\nsharks in the building trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is these sharks that have spoilt the good name of the\r\n\r\nbuilding trade, and it is these sharks that the Government seeks\r\n\r\nto control and suppress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I personally have no special love or hatred for these\r\n\r\nhousing  developers.

In recent months  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  serious deterioration of the cattle problem  and  large\r\n\r\nherds  of  cattle have been found roaming about built-up  areas,\r\n\r\neven  in  the City centre, causing a health nuisance and causing\r\n\r\ndamage to property, plants (and even of life!). Urgent action is\r\n\r\nnow  required  to control this problem as these wandering  herds\r\n\r\nseem  to  have increased in numbers. As the development  of  the\r\n\r\nCity  proceeds with increasing tempo, it is necessary  to  bring\r\n\r\nthis  problem  under firm and effective control  if  our  health\r\n\r\nstandards  are not to deteriorate. The fact that there  is  less\r\n\r\nand  less  land  for  cattle  grazing  in  the  State  must   be\r\n\r\nrecognised,  and  where  cattle grazing could  once  take  place\r\n\r\nwithout  serious  consequences, this is no  longer  possible  in\r\n\r\nSingapore today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cattle also present a problem in that they damage private\r\n\r\nand public property and tend to pollute water courses, drop dung\r\n\r\non  public  streets and other public places; and, in short,  con\r\n\r\nstitute  a  serious  health  menace.  Cowdung  constitutes   an\r\n\r\nexcellent source of breeding for flies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the control of different aspects of cattle was\r\n\r\ncovered  by  three  different authorities. Firstly,  the  Health\r\n\r\nDepartment was concerned only with the control of cattle insofar\r\n\r\nas  the licensing of cattle sheds and the sale of milk and  milk\r\n\r\nproducts was concerned. Secondly, the Police were concerned with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstray  cattle  under the Minor Offences Ordinance. Thirdly,  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production  Department have  been  concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nanimal husbandry aspects of cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is principally to control cattle\r\n\r\nwithin  the  State, including stray cattle, for the preservation\r\n\r\nof  public health. The Police are too preoccupied and  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  deal with stray cattle which  anyhow  present  a\r\n\r\nhealth  problem also. This will be done by total prohibition  of\r\n\r\ncattle in certain areas which may be declared by the Minister as\r\n\r\nrestricted  areas. In such restricted areas, no  cattle  of  the\r\n\r\ncategory described in the Minister's order may be kept  at  all;\r\n\r\nif  found, such cattle will be liable to seizure and disposal by\r\n\r\nthe  Health  Authorities without compensation.  In  other  areas\r\n\r\nwhich are not declared as restricted areas for cattle within the\r\n\r\nState,  the  keeping of cattle will be permitted  under  licence\r\n\r\nissued  by the Director of Medical Services. Here too,  this  is\r\n\r\nsubject to the proviso that such cattle shall be confined to the\r\n\r\nlicensed  place  specified  in the  licence  and  shall  not  be\r\n\r\npermitted  outside such licensed place except  upon  penalty  of\r\n\r\nseizure  and  disposal  without  compensation.  The  Bill   also\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the necessary powers to control the movement  and\r\n\r\ntransport of cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for penalties for owners of cattle or those\r\n\r\nin charge of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe cattle for non-compliance of the provisions of this Bill  or\r\n\r\nRegulations thereunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is in the phase of rapid development and is becoming\r\n\r\na  complex  urban  development. In this  situation,  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible to allow cattle within its developed and built-up area.\r\n\r\nThey  present a serious health problem (besides other  problems)\r\n\r\nand  the measures sought in the Bill are for an effective  means\r\n\r\nof controlling the cattle for the preservation of public health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the\r\n\r\nBill. - [MrYong Nyuk Lin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read\r\n\r\na Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now adjourn to a date to be\r\n\r\ndetermined by the Leader of the House.\" - [Mr S.
