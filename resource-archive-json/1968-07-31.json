Local manufacturers are  encouraged  to\r\n\r\nmake maximum use of these facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two aspects to standards.

There\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  a change in the nature  of  persons\r\n\r\nunemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, the bulk of unemployed - in fact, more\r\n\r\nthan three-quarters - are teenagers or youths of 20\r\n\r\nor  21  looking for their first jobs. It cannot  be\r\n\r\nsaid  that  extensive unemployment among  teenagers\r\n\r\nand  youths,  however regrettable it  may  be  from\r\n\r\nother  viewpoints, imposes acute hardship on  these\r\n\r\nunemployed,  for  they will be  living  with  their\r\n\r\nparents  and  at  least  will  have  their  regular\r\n\r\nsupplies  of  the  necessities  of  life  -   food,\r\n\r\nclothing, shelter and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the case of unemployment of laid-off base\r\n\r\nworkers, the majority will be the prinicipal bread-winners  of  their families. Prolonged unemployment\r\n\r\nwill  cause  distress not only to  the  unemployed;\r\n\r\nsuch  distress  will  extend to  their  dependants,\r\n\r\nincluding, of course, their children. This gives  a\r\n\r\nnew twist to the problem of unemployment, grave and\r\n\r\ndifficult though it already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis. In recognition of this fact, the Government has\r\n\r\nintroduced  legislation whereby lump  sum  benefits\r\n\r\npayable  to  laid-off workers will be paid  into  a\r\n\r\nCentral  Fund from which monthly payments  will  be\r\n\r\nmade  to  ensure that the imprudent do not squander\r\n\r\nthe  capital sum in a spending spree. But these are\r\n\r\npalliatives. The solution is to get them  new  jobs\r\n\r\nand if need be, to train them for new jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not deal with the steps which Government\r\n\r\nis  taking in various fields to meet this challenge\r\n\r\nto  our  economic stability. I need only  emphasise\r\n\r\nwhat my colleagues and I have been saying all these\r\n\r\nmonths.  The  crucial years ahead will demand  from\r\n\r\neveryone a considerable degree of exertion and even\r\n\r\nsacrifice. It will be a long and difficult  period,\r\n\r\nbut  if we can see through the years up to 1973  or\r\n\r\n1974, with our economy on an even keel, we can then\r\n\r\nlook   forward  to  a  resurgence  of  growth   and\r\n\r\nprosperity after that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These difficulties were not foreseen in 1967 when\r\n\r\nthe Commission under the chairmanship of Mr G.  J.\r\n\r\nHarvey entered into their lengthy deliberations  on\r\n\r\nthe  salary structure and conditions of service  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil service. This, of course, was not  their\r\n\r\nfault, but nevertheless their recommendations  must\r\n\r\nbe    considered   in   the   light   of    changed\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal and perhaps the most valuable work\r\n\r\nof  the  Commission relates to variable allowances.\r\n\r\nThe  Commission has recommended that the  time  has\r\n\r\narrived   to   abolish  variable  allowances.   The\r\n\r\nCommission arrived at this view on the basis of two\r\n\r\nconsiderations.  First, the  permanent  pensionable\r\n\r\npay  of civil servants should be based on long-term\r\n\r\nconsiderations, but in times of instability, it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  add  a  temporary,  non-pensionable,\r\n\r\naddition  to  this pay. Second, wages and  salaries\r\n\r\nshould  depend on services rendered and not on  the\r\n\r\nmarital status of the employee. In other words, the\r\n\r\nrate for the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission, taking into account the stability\r\n\r\nin  the cost of living since 1961, considered  that\r\n\r\nretention  of variable allowances is not justified,\r\n\r\nnor  should marital status of an officer decide how\r\n\r\nmuch pay he or she should get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the Commission recommended that the\r\n\r\nwhole  of variable allowances be consolidated  into\r\n\r\nbasic  pay.  This  would mean an  increase  in  the\r\n\r\npensionable emoluments of civil servants.  It  will\r\n\r\nalso  mean  an  increase  in  the  annual  cost  of\r\n\r\npensions which is estimated at $1.3 million a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts this recommendation of the\r\n\r\nSalaries  Commission. I want to stress that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  an  exercise  in general pay increase  but  of\r\n\r\nconsolidating a temporary allowance into total pay.\r\n\r\nThe  Salaries  Commission further  recommends  that\r\n\r\nofficers transfer into the new salary scales on the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  their present total pay. The  Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not accept this recommendation. No doubt  the\r\n\r\nCommission  was moved by considerations of  economy\r\n\r\nin  requiring  that  officers of different  marital\r\n\r\nstatus should enter at different points in the  new\r\n\r\nsalary  scales. The Government is of the view  that\r\n\r\nin  this  consolidation exercise, since the purpose\r\n\r\nis to remove anomalies arising from marital status,\r\n\r\nconversion   should  be  calculated   without   the\r\n\r\nlimitations  imposed by marital status.  This  will\r\n\r\nresult  in an increase in total emoluments  payable\r\n\r\nto  women officers, bachelors, and married officers\r\n\r\nwithout  children. The additional cost is estimated\r\n\r\nat $\u00bc million a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the consolidation exercise, the\r\n\r\nCommission  has  streamlined  the  general   salary\r\n\r\nstructure.  The  number of salary scales  has  been\r\n\r\nreduced.  For instance in Division I, the  existing\r\n\r\n34  salary  scales have been replaced by six  basic\r\n\r\nscales and 22 scales which are segments or parts of\r\n\r\nthe  basic scales. In Division II, the existing  44\r\n\r\nsalary scales are replaced by 14 basic scales  plus\r\n\r\n13  scales  which are segments or  parts  of  basic\r\n\r\nsalary scales. A similar tidying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  takes  place  in respect of  Division  III  and\r\n\r\nDivision  IV salary scales. In the case of Division\r\n\r\nIV  salary  scales, the process of tidying  up  has\r\n\r\nbenefited,   perhaps   quite  adventitiously,   the\r\n\r\nholders  of a large number of pasts. I shall  refer\r\n\r\nto this subject at a later stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts the general replacement of\r\n\r\nexisting scales in the new salary structure subject\r\n\r\nto  modifications  in respect of particular  salary\r\n\r\nscales with which I will deal in detail when I come\r\n\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission made recommendations in respect of\r\n\r\nsalaries.  These  recommendations fall  into  three\r\n\r\ngroups.   First,  the  Commission,  after  weighing\r\n\r\nrepresentations made by staff associations or staff\r\n\r\nrepresentatives,  recommended increases  in  salary\r\n\r\nscales  of  specific posts. Second, the  Commission\r\n\r\nrecommended a general increase in Division I salary\r\n\r\nscales   and  in  all  Superscale  posts  in   that\r\n\r\nDivision.  Third,  the  Salaries  Commission   drew\r\n\r\nattention to the inadequacy of salary scales of the\r\n\r\ntechnical grades, though it made no recommendations\r\n\r\nin  this  respect. I will deal with each  group  of\r\n\r\nrecommendations in turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first deals with certain specific salary\r\n\r\nscales. These relate to the following: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The Medical Ancillary Service and the Nursing Service;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The Library Service;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Honours and Pass Graduates in the Education Service;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Guard and Escort Unit, the Airport Auxiliary Police;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Fire service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the Medical Ancillary Service,\r\n\r\nwhich  comprises Almoners, Dieticians, Occupational\r\n\r\nTherapists  and  Radiographers, the Commission  did\r\n\r\nnot  consider the Executive Officers salary  scale,\r\n\r\non  which  they are now placed, the right  one  and\r\n\r\nrecommended an improved scale. The maximum  of  the\r\n\r\nrecommended salary scale, which is $925 p.m., is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigher by about $40 than the all-in salary scale at\r\n\r\nthe  maximum  of the present scale. Similarly,  the\r\n\r\nCommission did not consider that the Nurses  salary\r\n\r\nscale  should  be  related to the salary  scale  of\r\n\r\nClerical Officers, and also recommended an improved\r\n\r\nscale.  In  the case of Nurses the maximum  on  the\r\n\r\nscale  is  about  $48  per month  higher  than  the\r\n\r\npresent  all-in maximum. An increase at the maximum\r\n\r\nof  $36 has also been recommended by the Commission\r\n\r\nfor  Assistant Nurses and Midwives. The  Government\r\n\r\naccepts  in  full the recommendations  on  improved\r\n\r\nsalary  scales  for the Medical Ancillary  Service,\r\n\r\nNurses, Assistant Nurses and Midwives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to accept the improved\r\n\r\ngradings  for the posts of the Library  Service  of\r\n\r\nDirector,  Deputy  Director and Librarian  and  the\r\n\r\nimproved  salary scales for Higher Library Officers\r\n\r\nand   Library  Officers  as  recommended   by   the\r\n\r\nCommission.  The salaries payable to the  Director,\r\n\r\nDeputy   Director  and  Librarian  will  be   those\r\n\r\nappropriate  to  the  grades as recommended,  which\r\n\r\nwill  be different from that actually shown in  the\r\n\r\nReport in view of the decision of Government not to\r\n\r\nincrease salaries in Division I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission recommended that the salary scales\r\n\r\nof  Honours  and  Pass graduates in  the  Education\r\n\r\nService be improved. They recommended a new  salary\r\n\r\nscale  for each of the grades of graduates  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  that  Division  I  salary  scales  will   be\r\n\r\nimproved. The Government accepts the recommendation\r\n\r\nof  the  Salaries  Commission for  improvements  in\r\n\r\nsalary scales of Honours and Pass graduates in  the\r\n\r\nEducation  Service relative to the general  run  of\r\n\r\nsalary  scales. Since Government is  not  accepting\r\n\r\nthe  recommendation of the Commission for a general\r\n\r\nincrease   in   Division  I  salary   scales,   the\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  salary  scales  in  the  Education\r\n\r\nService will take this into account. A differential\r\n\r\nof  $150 a month is observed throughout the  length\r\n\r\nof  the scales of Honours and Pass graduates in the\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nService. For Honours graduates  the  salary\r\n\r\nscale will be as follows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$700x50-800/850x50-l,250/\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,300x50-1,500\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Pass graduates the salary scale will be\r\n\r\n$550x50-650/700x50-1,150/1,200x50-1,350.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Salaries Commission recommends the following\r\n\r\nsalaries  for  Teachers-in-Training  who  are  Non-Graduates.  For  four  categories  of  Teachers-in-\r\n\r\nTraining, that is, the School Certificate Teachers-in-Training,     Technical    Teachers-in-Training,\r\n\r\nDomestic  Science  Teachers-in-Training  and  Mixed\r\n\r\nFarming Teachers-in-Training, for these four grades\r\n\r\nthey  recommend  a pay of $l90xl0-2l0.  For  Higher\r\n\r\nSchool Certificate Teachers-in-Training $295: $315;\r\n\r\nfor  Craft  Trainee Teachers-in-Training $335;  for\r\n\r\nTeachers-in-Training  with  a  Technician   Diploma\r\n\r\n$425: $445: $465. For Trained Teachers, who are Non-graduates,  the  Commission  recommends  a   common\r\n\r\nsalary  scale of $295x20-335/385x20-505/560x25-660/750x35-925 p.m. into which all non-graduate\r\n\r\ntrained  teachers would be offered  the  option  to\r\n\r\nconvert. This new salary scale is based on the  new\r\n\r\nTeachers' Training College trained teacher's  scale\r\n\r\nwith   an   additional  increment.  The  Government\r\n\r\naccepts this recommendation. Where teachers  refuse\r\n\r\nthe  option offered they will be allowed to  remain\r\n\r\non  the  existing salaries with variable  allowance\r\n\r\npersonal to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission is of the view that there should\r\n\r\nbe  no distinction between members of the rank  and\r\n\r\nfile  of  the Regular Police Force, the  Guard  and\r\n\r\nEscort Unit and the Airport Auxiliary Police Force,\r\n\r\nand  recommends  that  the three  Units  should  be\r\n\r\nplaced  on  the same salary scales and they  should\r\n\r\nreceive  the  same training. These  recommendations\r\n\r\nare  not  accepted. The whole object  of  having  a\r\n\r\nGuard  and  Escort Unit is to have a less expensive\r\n\r\nforce  to  perform  simpler  duties  which  require\r\n\r\nsimpler  training. The same is true of the  Airport\r\n\r\nAuxiliary Police Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the Fire Service, the Commission\r\n\r\nrecommended that so far\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  the  subordinate  staff  are  concerned,  i.e.,\r\n\r\nLeading Firemen and Firemen, those employed in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Fire  Brigade and their counterparts  in\r\n\r\nthe  Airport  Fire Section should be  on  the  same\r\n\r\nsalary   scale.   The   Government   accepts   this\r\n\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending a review of salary scales by a future\r\n\r\nSalaries  Commission,  which  it  recommended,  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Court made certain  interim\r\n\r\nawards  in respect of outstanding cases before  it.\r\n\r\nThe awards are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Midwives:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Pupil Midwives: Temporary Allowance of $6 p.m. after the first year of training;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Staff Midwives: Temporary Allowance of $12 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Senior Midwives: Temporary Allowance of $15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Timescale Clerks in the Postal and Telecommunications Department: Interim Allowance of $15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Customs Officers:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Customs Officers: Interim Allowance of $10 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Customs Officers: Interim Allowance of $15 p.m. Senior Grade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since these interim allowances were awarded\r\n\r\npending the establishment of new salary scales  for\r\n\r\nthe grades concerned by the Salaries Commission, it\r\n\r\nis  logical that these allowances should  disappear\r\n\r\nas  and when the new salary scales are implemented.\r\n\r\nIn  respect of Midwives and Timescale Clerks in the\r\n\r\nPostal   and  Telecommunications  Department,   the\r\n\r\nCommission  made  this clear, when  it  recommended\r\n\r\nthat  these  officers should transfer  to  the  new\r\n\r\nsalary  scales  recommended for  them  without  the\r\n\r\naddition  of  this interim allowance. Although  the\r\n\r\nCommission   is  silent  in  respect   of   Customs\r\n\r\nOfficers,  it  is logical to infer  that  the  same\r\n\r\nprinciple of conversion should apply to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere   officers  prefer  to  retain  the   interim\r\n\r\nallowance, they will be permitted to do so but they\r\n\r\nwill  have  to remain on the unrevised scales  with\r\n\r\nvariable allowance personal to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission found the present schemes of\r\n\r\nservice  for the Technical Grades to be  inadequate\r\n\r\nand  unsatisfactory and recommended an  examination\r\n\r\nand   re-organisation  of  these   services.   This\r\n\r\nrecommendation is accepted and it is proposed  that\r\n\r\nthis  review  be conducted by an ad  hoc  Committee\r\n\r\ncomprising the Deputy Secretary (Establishment)  as\r\n\r\nChairman,    and    representatives    from     the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications   Department,    Public    Works\r\n\r\nDepartment and the Broadcasting Department, all  of\r\n\r\nwhom  should  be technical personnel,  as  members.\r\n\r\nThis  Committee  could  be  asked  to  examine  and\r\n\r\nrecommend  a  suitable structure for the  technical\r\n\r\ngrades and the appropriate salary scales for  these\r\n\r\ngrades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I referred a moment ago to Division IV grades.\r\n\r\nThe Commission considered the existing scales which\r\n\r\nhave annual increments varying from $2 per month to\r\n\r\n$8  per  month  to be unrealistic.  The  Commission\r\n\r\nconsidered  that  increments on the  salary  scales\r\n\r\nshould  be of meaningful size and in the new scales\r\n\r\nfor  Division IV, the increments range from  $5  to\r\n\r\n$15.  Most  of  the recommended salary  scales  for\r\n\r\nDivision IV show some increases at the maximum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts this recommendation of\r\n\r\nthe Salaries Commission. The Government proposes to\r\n\r\ngo  further than the Salaries Commission in respect\r\n\r\nof  Division  IV salary scales. Hon.  Members  know\r\n\r\nthat  contributors  to the Central  Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nwill,  in the course of the next few years, receive\r\n\r\nadditional    benefits   by   way    of    enhanced\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  the Fund  by  the  employer.  In\r\n\r\neffect,  this  means  that the Government's  daily-rated  workers  as  compared with the  monthly-paid\r\n\r\npensionable   employees   will   enjoy   additional\r\n\r\nbenefits, which will total 5 per cent of their pay.\r\n\r\nEmployees of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivate firms contributing to the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund   will   also  receive  these  benefits.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment considers that pensionable employees  in\r\n\r\nDivision  IV  salary  scales  and  promotion  posts\r\n\r\nattached  to  Division  IV  salary  scales,  should\r\n\r\nreceive   an   increase   of   approximately   this\r\n\r\nproportion,  in instances where the revised  salary\r\n\r\nscales have not given these increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the recommendations for general\r\n\r\nincrease  in  Division  I  salary  scales  and   in\r\n\r\nSuperscale posts. The Commission reported that  \"it\r\n\r\nwas  the  general view of both private and official\r\n\r\nwitnesses  that  the current level of  remuneration\r\n\r\nand other service conditions relating to Division I\r\n\r\nSuperscale     Officers,    including     Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries,  Heads of Departments  and  Specialist\r\n\r\nOfficers  at  these  levels were  not  sufficiently\r\n\r\ncompetitive in relation to salary and conditions of\r\n\r\nservice  obtaining  in  the  private  sector\".  The\r\n\r\nCommission  were satisfied that this  general  view\r\n\r\nwas  correct,  and  taking all  the  evidence  into\r\n\r\naccount, they were satisfied that there was a  case\r\n\r\nfor  an  increase  in the pay of the  higher  civil\r\n\r\nservants,  and  recommended  salary  increases  for\r\n\r\nofficers in the Superscale grades as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superscale Grade C: an increase in existing all-in pay of $2,350 a month to $2,750.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superscale Grade D: an increase in existing all-in pay of $2,170 a month to $2,500\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superscale Grade E: an increase in existing all-in pay of $2,070 a month to $2,350.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superscale Grade F: an increase in existing all-in pay of $2,020 a month to $2,250.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superscale Grade G: an increase in existing all-in pay of $1,920 a month to $2,150.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This represents increases ranging from $230 p.m. to\r\n\r\n$400 p.m. at the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission commented that most of the\r\n\r\nwitnesses who appeared before the Commission stated\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfringe  benefits, such as free cars, interest-free\r\n\r\nloans for certain specific purposes, entertainment\r\n\r\nallowances,  etc.,  for  senior  staff  were  more\r\n\r\nfavourable  in the private sector. The  Commission\r\n\r\nhad   no   doubt   that   fringe   benefits   were\r\n\r\nconsiderable and attractive in the private sector,\r\n\r\nbut  felt that the present differences between the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  and  the private  sector  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter had to be accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the Administrative Service, the\r\n\r\nCommission reported as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The evidence we received from the private\r\n\r\nsector  on  salary  scales paid  to  their  middle\r\n\r\nExecutive  Grades  covering  a  wide  variety   of\r\n\r\noccupations  indicated that the salaries  paid  to\r\n\r\nAdministrative Officers in Government  during  the\r\n\r\nfirst  3  years of their career compare favourably\r\n\r\nwith  those  of their counterparts in the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  but  that  thereafter  salaries  in   the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  are bigger than  those  paid  for\r\n\r\nAdministrative Service Officers.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Also,  most  witnesses \"agreed that industry  and\r\n\r\ncommerce   nowadays   offer   better   and    more\r\n\r\nopportunities for advancement for a  good  Honours\r\n\r\nDegree  graduate than exist in the Civil Service\".\r\n\r\nIn  the  light  of this evidence,  the  Commission\r\n\r\nrecommended  additional increments at the  maximum\r\n\r\nto the salary scale for Administrative Officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with regret that I have to inform the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  the recommendations of  the  Salaries\r\n\r\nCommission  in respect of Superscale Officers  and\r\n\r\nDivision  I  Officers are not  acceptable  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Salaries  of Superscale  Grades  will\r\n\r\nremain  the  same  as  at  present,  except   that\r\n\r\nvariable  allowances  will  be  consolidated  into\r\n\r\npensionable  pay.  For the Administrative  Service\r\n\r\nthe Commission recommended a scale as follows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$800 x 50 - 900/950 x 50 - 1,050/1,200 x 50 - 2,000 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government proposes the following scale : -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$900 x 50 - 1,000/1,050 x 50 - 1,400/1,450 x 50 - 1,850 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related salary scales in Division I will follow a\r\n\r\nsimilar pattern maintaining approximately the same\r\n\r\ndifferential with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Administrative Service Scale. Details of  all\r\n\r\nsalary scales and method of conversion will be set\r\n\r\nout  in a forthcoming Treasury Circular. When  the\r\n\r\nwhole   country  is  being  enjoined  to  put   in\r\n\r\nadditional  effort without thought of  recompense,\r\n\r\nthis  is  not  the proper moment  to  introduce  a\r\n\r\ngeneral increase in the pay of top civil servants,\r\n\r\nhowever  much  they may deserve it.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  it  is necessary that the Government  takes\r\n\r\ncertain action to ensure that there is no drift of\r\n\r\nthe  best talent in the civil service into private\r\n\r\nenterprise. Government proposes to achieve this by\r\n\r\ntwo  measures.  First, to carry out more  frequent\r\n\r\npromotion  exercises. There is a large  number  of\r\n\r\nposts in the civil service establishment which are\r\n\r\nnot substantively filled in the upper echelons  of\r\n\r\nthe  service. This is because of the policy of the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission to promote only officers\r\n\r\nof  outstanding  merit. Everyone will  agree  that\r\n\r\nthis policy of the Public Service Commission is  a\r\n\r\nsound  one.  Nevertheless, nearly  10  years  have\r\n\r\npassed  since  the Malayanisation  exercises  were\r\n\r\ncompleted. University graduates recruited into the\r\n\r\ncivil service since then and others promoted  from\r\n\r\nthe ranks into the Administrative Service have  by\r\n\r\nnow  ample  time  and opportunity  to  demonstrate\r\n\r\ntheir  worth. This may be the appropriate occasion\r\n\r\nto  carry out an extensive promotion exercise.  In\r\n\r\nthis way, the meritorious will be rewarded without\r\n\r\nrecourse  to a general increase in salaries  which\r\n\r\nwill  benefit both the outstanding officer as well\r\n\r\nas those not deserving of reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy has its limitations. Officers on the\r\n\r\ntop   ladder,  i.e.,  the  Permanent  Secretaries,\r\n\r\noccupying  substantive  posts  on  Superscale  'C'\r\n\r\ncannot  climb further. Therefore, it is  necessary\r\n\r\nto  revise  the  structure of the  top  Superscale\r\n\r\nposts.  The  Government proposes to introduce  two\r\n\r\nSuperscale posts. Superscale 'B' with a total  pay\r\n\r\nof  $2,700 a month and Superscale 'A' at $3,000  a\r\n\r\nmonth.  Substantive  holders  of  Superscale   'C'\r\n\r\nappointments will be considered in the forthcoming\r\n\r\npromotion  exercise for promotion to Superscale  B\r\n\r\nand A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of these Superscales B and A\r\n\r\nwould  mean that the salary structures of  the  top\r\n\r\nechelons  of  other  services,  for  example,   the\r\n\r\nJudicial   Service  and  some  senior  appointments\r\n\r\noutside the normal ranks of the civil service, such\r\n\r\nas  the  Chairman of the Public Service Commission,\r\n\r\nwill have to be revised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of Medical and Dental Officers, the\r\n\r\nCommission recommended as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'While it is reasonable in our view to have some\r\n\r\nregard  to the standard of remuneration of  general\r\n\r\npractitioners and consultants in private  practice,\r\n\r\nwe  think  that the type of work and conditions  of\r\n\r\nemployment  of  those in the private sector  differ\r\n\r\nmaterially  from  most  of those  employed  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment service. The pattern of the working life\r\n\r\nof  a  private  practitioner is entirely  different\r\n\r\nfrom  those  performed  by Government  Medical  and\r\n\r\nDental Officers.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Nevertheless,   it   was  the   opinion   of   the\r\n\r\nCommission  that \"there is considerable  weight  in\r\n\r\nthe  arguments mentioned above for improved  salary\r\n\r\nscales for Medical and Dental Officers in order  to\r\n\r\nattract  and  retain officers in the Service\".  For\r\n\r\nthese  officers, the Commission recommended  salary\r\n\r\nscales  which provide for a substantial jump  after\r\n\r\nthe bar in the third year of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government does not accept this recommendation of\r\n\r\nthe   Commission.  The  shortage  of  doctors   and\r\n\r\ndentists     which    doubtless    induced     this\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of the Commission has  come  to  an\r\n\r\nend,  and  doctors and dentists in  the  Government\r\n\r\nservice  will convert in the normal way to the  new\r\n\r\nsalary scale of $1,100x50-1,400/1,450x50-1,850 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission expressed the opinion that the\r\n\r\npresent  quantum of Specialist Allowance  fixed  in\r\n\r\n1958 needed revision. Specialists in the Government\r\n\r\nmedical   service  represent  a  group  of   highly\r\n\r\nqualified   and  experienced  personnel   who   are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the maintenance of high  standards\r\n\r\nof  medical practice not only in Government service\r\n\r\nbut   outside  it.  Evidence  was  given   to   the\r\n\r\nCommission that the personal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemoluments  did not provide a sufficient  incentive\r\n\r\nfor  these  officers to remain  in  the  Government\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission recommended that the existing\r\n\r\nrates  of  Specialist  Allowance  for  Medical  and\r\n\r\nDental Specialist should be increased. They further\r\n\r\nrecommended  that  the existing  classification  of\r\n\r\nSpecialist  into the categories of  Clinical.  Non-Clinical  and Administrative Specialist be  reduced\r\n\r\nto  two categories of Clinical Specialists with the\r\n\r\nsame allowance and Administrative Specialists.  For\r\n\r\nSuperscale  G  Specialists, the allowance  of  $250\r\n\r\np.m. for Clinical Specialist and $200 p.m. for Non-Clinical  Specialist should be raised to $500  p.m.\r\n\r\nIn  respect of Superscale E, the allowance of  $500\r\n\r\nfor  Clinical  Specialist and $350 for Non-Clinical\r\n\r\nSpecialist  should  be  raised  to  $750  p.m.   No\r\n\r\nincreases  were  recommended for the Administrative\r\n\r\nSpecialist in Grades G and E, but the allowance for\r\n\r\nthe  Administrative Specialist in Superscale C  has\r\n\r\nbeen  recommended to be raised from  $200  to  $500\r\n\r\np.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government accepts this recommendation except in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  Administrative  Specialist  posts   in\r\n\r\nSuperscale  C. The question of Specialist  pay  for\r\n\r\nAdministrative Specialists in Superscale  Grades  G\r\n\r\nand   E   needs  to  be  further  considered.   The\r\n\r\nCommission   has   made   no  recommendations   for\r\n\r\nincreases  in  these  grades.  This  may  lead   to\r\n\r\ndifficulties in that a. Specialist on posting to an\r\n\r\nAdministrative  position will suffer  reduction  in\r\n\r\npay.  As  a  result of this policy,  Administrative\r\n\r\npositions in the Medical Service may be held by the\r\n\r\nless  meritorious  so  far  as  medical  skill   is\r\n\r\nconcerned.  Of  course,  no  one  will  argue  that\r\n\r\nAdministrative skills and Medical Specialist skills\r\n\r\ngo together. Nevertheless, the virtual exclusion of\r\n\r\nbest specialist skills from making any contribution\r\n\r\nto administrative efficacy is disturbing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the added complication that if doctors\r\n\r\nperforming administrative functions in Grade G  and\r\n\r\nE posts were to get very substantial allowances, as\r\n\r\ncompared with their counterparts in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Administrative Service, they would, in fact, be\r\n\r\ngetting more pay for doing the same type of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth  are  working together to  find  a  mutually\r\n\r\nsatisfactory solution to this very tricky problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission recommended that where an officer\r\n\r\nis  acting in a post because it is vacant  and  not\r\n\r\nbecause  the incumbent is on leave, he should  draw\r\n\r\nacting  allowance of the full difference in  salary\r\n\r\nup  to  a  maximum of $250 a month. The  Government\r\n\r\naccepts  that acting allowances should be increased\r\n\r\nto  two-thirds of the difference in salary up to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  $250  a  month  as  against  half  the\r\n\r\ndifference  and a maximum of $200 p.m, at  present.\r\n\r\nIt does not agree to the full difference being paid\r\n\r\non the grounds that if an officer is considered fit\r\n\r\nto  receive the full difference he should have been\r\n\r\npromoted substantively. Another reason is that many\r\n\r\nofficers  act in higher posts as a result  of  pure\r\n\r\nchance simply because they happen to be on the spot\r\n\r\nand not because of proven merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not accept the recommendation\r\n\r\nof  the  Commission that an officer with 20  years'\r\n\r\npensionable  service should not  lose  his  pension\r\n\r\nentirely if he were to be dismissed on disciplinary\r\n\r\ngrounds.  The Government accepts the recommendation\r\n\r\nthat  an  officer  retired in the  public  interest\r\n\r\nshould  retain  some  of his  pension  rights.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment also accepts the recommendation  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission  that  benefits payable  in  respect  of\r\n\r\ninjury  or  death  arising in the  course  of  duty\r\n\r\nshould be improved. Government does not accept  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of a scheme to provide  for  widows\r\n\r\nand  dependants of pensioners in view of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the Widows and Orphans Pension Scheme,  which\r\n\r\nprovided  for this, was unpopular and was abolished\r\n\r\nas a result of representations from staff unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards retirement benefits, the Commission\r\n\r\nmade far-reaching recommendations on changes to the\r\n\r\nPensions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRules. It noted that it would not be practicable to\r\n\r\noffer  provident fund benefits in addition  to  the\r\n\r\npension  scheme. The Commission also expressed  the\r\n\r\nopinion that the quantum of pensions payable  under\r\n\r\npresent regulations is adequate. However, the terms\r\n\r\nof  eligibility,  in its opinion, are  too  rigidly\r\n\r\ndetermined  by  the present Pensions Ordinance.  It\r\n\r\nrecommended  a more flexible system. In particular,\r\n\r\nit  recommended  that  a  pensionable  officer  who\r\n\r\nleaves  the  service after 20 years of  pensionable\r\n\r\nservice should not lose his entire pension, even if\r\n\r\nhe  has not reached the age of optional retirement.\r\n\r\nGovernment accepts the need for more flexibility in\r\n\r\nthe  present Pensions Ordinance. It does not accept\r\n\r\nthe  recommendation that officers  with  20  years'\r\n\r\nservice  should  retain  some  pension  rights   on\r\n\r\nleaving the service prematurely. The Commission has\r\n\r\nnot  made any recommendations in respect of quantum\r\n\r\nof pensions to he retained in such instances, it is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  decide on this. If the quantum  were\r\n\r\nfixed at too low a level, the new benefits may well\r\n\r\nbe  regarded  as derisory. On the other  hand,  any\r\n\r\nsubstantial concession on this point may lead to an\r\n\r\nundesirable   exodus  of  talent  from   Government\r\n\r\nemployment into the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the Government has decided that,\r\n\r\nsubject to the approval of the President acting  on\r\n\r\nthe  advice of the Cabinet, officers with 20  years\r\n\r\nof  pensionable  service may  be  retired  on  full\r\n\r\npension  rights  without recourse  to  disciplinary\r\n\r\nproceedings  as administered by the Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission in the case of retirement in the  public\r\n\r\ninterest.  This  will enable Government  to  retire\r\n\r\nofficers whose continued employment would be of  no\r\n\r\nadvantage  to  the  service  without  reducing  the\r\n\r\nmarket  value  of  the officer in  his  search  for\r\n\r\nemployment in the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission covered a wide field and made\r\n\r\nrecommendations  on  a  large  number  of  detailed\r\n\r\npoints.  For instance, it recommended  that  a  Pay\r\n\r\nResearch   Unit  be  established  to  undertake   a\r\n\r\ncontinuous study of relative pay in jobs within the\r\n\r\ngovernment service and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween  government service and the private sector.\r\n\r\nIt   made  recommendations  on  translators   fees,\r\n\r\nmedical   benefits,  rentals  paid  by   government\r\n\r\nemployees, privileges of free supply of electricity\r\n\r\nand water and on numerous other matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not be appropriate for me to enter into\r\n\r\neach  and  every  recommendation.  These  will   be\r\n\r\ndescribed in a Treasury paper which will be  issued\r\n\r\nshortly. In most instances, the recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthe Commission have been accepted. In some, further\r\n\r\nstudies are needed before a decision can finally be\r\n\r\nmade, and in a few instances the recommendation  of\r\n\r\nthe Commission has not been accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general review of pay and conditions of service\r\n\r\nof  the whole civil service is a complex and  major\r\n\r\nundertaking,  bearing in mind that  the  Government\r\n\r\nemploys  more than 50,000 employees. Implementation\r\n\r\nof  these  proposals  or amendments  of  them  will\r\n\r\nconstitute a major administrative exercise. I  have\r\n\r\nindicated  the Government's position in respect  of\r\n\r\nthe major recommendations of the Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that the Government has not\r\n\r\naccepted   any   salary  increases   except   those\r\n\r\nrecommended  for a few specific grades,  i.e.,  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Ancillary  Service, the  Nursing  Service,\r\n\r\nMidwives  and  Graduate  Teachers.  The  Government\r\n\r\nagrees  to  the recommended improvements for  these\r\n\r\nofficers  because  they  have  been  made  by   the\r\n\r\nCommission  after  a  very careful  study  and  are\r\n\r\nconsidered  justifiable based on their relationship\r\n\r\nwith  other grades in the civil service. Where  the\r\n\r\nCommission's recommendations are accepted, I do not\r\n\r\nexpect much difficulty in having them implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Government has decided at present not to\r\n\r\naccept  the  recommendation of the  Commission,  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  will be given to trade  unions,  staff\r\n\r\nassociations   and   others   affected   to    make\r\n\r\nrepresentations   to  the  Treasury   or   to   the\r\n\r\nappropriate Ministry before a final\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecision  is  taken.

The  National\r\n\r\nTrades  Union Congress is most reasonable,  and  it\r\n\r\ndid recommend that bonus should be negotiable up to\r\n\r\na  maximum  of one month. Anything more  than  that\r\n\r\nshould  be  for  mutual  negotiation  or  agreement\r\n\r\nbetween employer and employee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated earlier, the payment of annual\r\n\r\nbonus  is  very  important to the workers,  because\r\n\r\nthey  require money especially at the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nyear  for  expenses  incurred  during  the  various\r\n\r\nreligious  festivals. In addition, if  the  workers\r\n\r\nhave  families, they will need extra money  to  buy\r\n\r\nschool  uniforms,  school  books,  etc, for  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  In  this  respect, we therefore  request\r\n\r\nthat  (a) bonus should be negotiable (b) it  should\r\n\r\nbe  up  to  a limit of one month, and (c)  anything\r\n\r\nmore  than that should be by mutual consent between\r\n\r\nthe  employer  and employees. It is  quite  natural\r\n\r\nthat  the workers will definitely know how to  save\r\n\r\nany surplus money after incurring various expenses.\r\n\r\nUnless  they get their annual bonus, their  chances\r\n\r\nof saving money are almost negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause read a Second time and added to the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with amendments; read a Third time\r\n\r\nand passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ARBITRATION (INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT DISPUTES)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That\r\n\r\nthe Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill seeks to ratify the\r\n\r\nConvention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes\r\n\r\nbetween States and Nationals of Other States, which\r\n\r\nSingapore signed on 2nd February, 1968, so that the\r\n\r\nInstrument of Ratification of the Convention can be\r\n\r\ndeposited with the World Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convention is a code of international conduct\r\n\r\nwhich   Singapore,   trying  to   attract   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment,  should adopt as it is an assurance  to\r\n\r\nforeign   investors  that  disputes   about   their\r\n\r\ninvestments  here would be submitted to arbitration\r\n\r\nby  the  International  Centre  for  Settlement  of\r\n\r\nInvestment  Disputes, which has  its  seat  in  the\r\n\r\nWorld Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centre has jurisdiction over any legal\r\n\r\ndisputes  arising  directly out  of  an  investment\r\n\r\nbetween  a  contracting state  and  a  national  of\r\n\r\nanother contracting state, which the parties to the\r\n\r\nConvention  consent in writing  to  submit  to  the\r\n\r\nCentre. However, any contracting state may  at  the\r\n\r\ntime  of ratification of the Convention or  at  any\r\n\r\ntime  thereafter notify the Centre of the class  or\r\n\r\nclasses  of  disputes which it would or  would  not\r\n\r\nconsider  submitting  to the  jurisdiction  of  the\r\n\r\nCentre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would, therefore, be necessary to enact\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  enable  Singapore  to  ratify  the\r\n\r\nConvention.

It provides for  the\r\n\r\nsettlement of disputes between a contracting  state\r\n\r\nparty  like Singapore and a national of  a  foreign\r\n\r\nstate.

That\r\n\r\nbeing so, why subscribe to this Convention at all,\r\n\r\nbecause   our  courts,  I  think,  are   certainly\r\n\r\ncredible  enough  and capable enough  of  settling\r\n\r\nsuch disputes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Parliamentary Secretary has stated, the\r\n\r\nprocedure  that  is intended to  be  adopted  with\r\n\r\nregard to the registration of awards would be  the\r\n\r\nprocedure that is at the moment being carried  out\r\n\r\nin  our  High Court. There again the procedure  of\r\n\r\nour  courts is being adopted. That being the case,\r\n\r\nI  do  not  see  why we should subscribe  to  this\r\n\r\nConvention  in  the first place.  Apart  from  the\r\n\r\nquestion  that it derogates from our  sovereignty,\r\n\r\nthe  Convention also provides for the  utilisation\r\n\r\nof  a  substantial  part of the procedure  of  our\r\n\r\ncourts and, therefore, our courts.

I think\r\n\r\nthe  labour  movement would associate itself  with\r\n\r\nsuch  a  timely  act  to gain  the  confidence  of\r\n\r\nprospective international financial investors. The\r\n\r\nRepublic  has  already established  for  itself  a\r\n\r\nreputation for respect for law and order, and  the\r\n\r\nmove  to give legal protection to investors  is  a\r\n\r\nmove  in the right direction. The adoption of  the\r\n\r\nBill  will definitely strengthen the image of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic and its people. We have all witnessed  on\r\n\r\nnot  too few occasions when other governments have\r\n\r\nruled without any respect for the agreements  they\r\n\r\nhave entered into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of the Arbitration (International\r\n\r\nInvestment  Disputes)  Bill  into  law   and   its\r\n\r\nenforcement    will    necessarily    mean     the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the International Convention  on\r\n\r\nthe  Settlement  of  Investment  Disputes  between\r\n\r\nStates  and  Nationals  of Other  States  and  the\r\n\r\nregistration by the Republic's High Court  of  the\r\n\r\naward   of  the  International  Centre   for   the\r\n\r\nSettlement  of  Investment  Disputes.  The  direct\r\n\r\neffect of accepting the Convention will mean  that\r\n\r\nthe Republic does not live by arbitrary rules. The\r\n\r\nArbitration  (International  Investment  Disputes)\r\n\r\nBill   does   not  necessarily  imply   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Singapore expects to have  disputes\r\n\r\nwith foreign investors. It is, however, vital that\r\n\r\nthere   must   be   the  international   machinery\r\n\r\navailable  to settle the disputes. The Arbitration\r\n\r\n(International  Investment  Disputes)  Bill   will\r\n\r\noffer  the machinery. Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nbeg to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, may I allay the doubts\r\n\r\nraised by the Member for Serangoon Gardens?

This\r\n\r\nis  provided  by  Article 26  of  the  Convention.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,  the Articles are  attached  to  the\r\n\r\nBill as a Schedule. Article 26 reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Consent of the parties to arbitration under\r\n\r\nthis Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be\r\n\r\ndeemed   consent  to  such  arbitration   to   the\r\n\r\nexclusion of any other remedy.

That Act\r\n\r\nintroduced  a  new concept of ownership,  and  flat\r\n\r\nowners registered under that Act may have doubts as\r\n\r\nto  what their property tax position is, since they\r\n\r\nare  owners of property situated \"in the  air\"  and\r\n\r\nthus  somewhat  different from the  usual  type  of\r\n\r\nownership attached to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, a new paragraph (e) is added to the\r\n\r\nproviso to section 2 of the Property Tax Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe  new paragraph seeks to ascertain, firstly, who\r\n\r\nthe owner of each such lot or flat \"in the air\" is.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  it states that the annual value  of  the\r\n\r\nflat  is to be assessed in the same manner  as  any\r\n\r\nother  freehold  estate in land. And,  thirdly,  it\r\n\r\nexcludes the land on which the flats are built from\r\n\r\nassessment  when the flats are already individually\r\n\r\nassessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of property comprised in a statutory\r\n\r\nland  grant  or lease of State land or a  lease  of\r\n\r\nproperty  for a period exceeding three years  by  a\r\n\r\npublic  authority,  another  paragraph  2  (f)   is\r\n\r\ninserted.  Firstly, it deems the grantee or  lessee\r\n\r\nof  such  land  to  be the owner  for  purposes  of\r\n\r\nassessing  annual value. Secondly, it provides  for\r\n\r\nthe  assessment of property to be conducted in  the\r\n\r\nsame  way as if they are freehold estates in  land.\r\n\r\nAnd thirdly, it disallows deductions for premium or\r\n\r\nrent   payable  to  the  Government  so  that  full\r\n\r\nproperty tax may be levied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present situation is that when such lands are\r\n\r\nleased with a prohibition against sub-letting,  the\r\n\r\nlessee is not regarded as the owner for purposes of\r\n\r\nthe  Property Tax Ordinance and so no tax is  paid.\r\n\r\nWhere  there is no prohibition against sub-letting,\r\n\r\nthe  lessee is regarded as the owner and pays  tax.\r\n\r\nBut  the law at present allows the lessee to deduct\r\n\r\nthe proportionate amount of the tax paid or (in the\r\n\r\ncase of Government leases) the rent payable to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been considerable difficulty in\r\n\r\ncollecting  property tax in such cases  and  it  is\r\n\r\nhoped   that   with  the  introduction   of   these\r\n\r\namendments, full property tax will be collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public authority for this purpose is then\r\n\r\naccordingly defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next amendment affects section 17 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  At  the  moment,  when  a  building  is\r\n\r\ndemolished  or removed, the owner of such  property\r\n\r\nis  required to give written notice of such changes\r\n\r\nto   his  property  to  the  Chief  Assessor.   The\r\n\r\namendment  now  requires this notice  to  be  given\r\n\r\nwithin  15  days  from the date  of  completion  of\r\n\r\ndemolition or removal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same section, the Comptroller is empowered\r\n\r\nto  tax the owner of such property according to the\r\n\r\nexisting  annual  value ascribed to  the  property,\r\n\r\neven  though  it is demolished or removed.  In  the\r\n\r\namendment,  he  is given the option of  taxing  the\r\n\r\nowner according to a revised annual value instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6 (7) is next amended in view of the\r\n\r\ndelays encountered in the collection of the amounts\r\n\r\npayable  in  lieu  of  property  tax  from   public\r\n\r\nauthorities  and  bodies corporate.  To  discourage\r\n\r\nundue lateness in payment of such contributions, it\r\n\r\nis  now  stipulated that should  payments  be  made\r\n\r\nlater  than the third week from the end of  January\r\n\r\nor  July  of  each year, the unpaid  sum  shall  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as  arrears of property tax that  can  be\r\n\r\nrecovered  with  interest at  the  prevailing  bank\r\n\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, an amendment is made to transfer the\r\n\r\npower  of  appointing officers under the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nfrom the President to the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Tang See Chim].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That\r\n\r\nthe Bill be now read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to enable Singapore to become a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  International Finance  Corporation\r\n\r\n(I.F.C.), which is an affiliate organisation of the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank.

This   section   in  the   1957   Ordinance\r\n\r\ncorresponds to Article 58 of the Constitution. Both\r\n\r\nthe provisions require a citizen who is a minor  to\r\n\r\ntake  the  oath  of  renunciation,  allegiance  and\r\n\r\nloyalty  within  twelve  months  of  his  attaining\r\n\r\nmajority.

It has  been  found\r\n\r\nfrom  practical experience that it  would  be  more\r\n\r\ndesirable  to have a panel from whom may be  chosen\r\n\r\ntwo  members  to form such a Committee of  Inquiry.\r\n\r\nThis  will  expedite the hearing  of  appeals.

Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be\r\n\r\nnow read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, like the Employment Bill, is an\r\n\r\nattempt     to     rationalise    employer-employee\r\n\r\nrelationship   with  a  view  to   attracting   new\r\n\r\ninvestments  and increasing the efficiency  of  our\r\n\r\ntrading  and  industrial  enterprises.  This  Bill,\r\n\r\nunlike  the Employment Bill, deals with the  rights\r\n\r\nand  responsibilities of management. Efficiency  of\r\n\r\nan enterprise depends on effective management, more\r\n\r\nso  as  our  commercial and industrial  enterprises\r\n\r\nbecome more modernised, more complex and bigger  as\r\n\r\nthey  must  if  they are to hold their  own  in  an\r\n\r\nincreasingly  competitive world.  The  more  highly\r\n\r\norganised our economy becomes, the more up-to-date,\r\n\r\nresourceful   and  imaginative  must   become   our\r\n\r\nmanagement methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade unions have never questioned the rights\r\n\r\nof  management  to manage, first, as  a  matter  of\r\n\r\ncommon-sense and, second, because these rights  are\r\n\r\ncommon  law  rights. But whatever  the  theory  the\r\n\r\nrights  of  management have  over  the  years  been\r\n\r\neroded, perhaps not as a conscious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy,  by trade unions. What this Bill seeks  to\r\n\r\ndo  is to restore these rights of management to the\r\n\r\nemployers by making common law rights into  statute\r\n\r\nlaw.  No  rights  are  being taken  away  from  the\r\n\r\nworkers  because  the workers never  claimed  these\r\n\r\nrights,  even though some of these rights have,  in\r\n\r\npractice, been denied to management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not restoring these rights to management\r\n\r\nmerely out of a sense of justice and fair play, but\r\n\r\nbecause   we  are  convinced  that  unless   proper\r\n\r\nmanagement  functions are allowed to  be  performed\r\n\r\nunhampered  there would be little  or  no  economic\r\n\r\nexpansion  or  fresh investments.  No  investor  or\r\n\r\nentrepreneur is going to risk millions  of  dollars\r\n\r\nif  he has not the final say and the responsibility\r\n\r\nto  decide how the enterprise should be run.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  saying  that unions have deliberately  claimed\r\n\r\nthe  rights  of management because then they  would\r\n\r\nalso  have to take on the responsibilities that  go\r\n\r\nwith  it. But unwittingly they have trespassed into\r\n\r\nthis sphere by querying the right of management  to\r\n\r\nhire,  fire,  promote and transfer employees  where\r\n\r\nthese  are  necessary to enhance the efficiency  of\r\n\r\nthe  enterprise. Yet the essence of  management  is\r\n\r\nthe  ability of the management to deploy its labour\r\n\r\nresources and skills in the most effective and most\r\n\r\nrational way - and central to this is to be able to\r\n\r\nrecruit  the most qualified worker, to promote  the\r\n\r\nmost  able,  to get rid of the inefficient  and  to\r\n\r\ntransfer  a worker where he is most needed.  These,\r\n\r\nto  a certain extent, involve judgment but, by  and\r\n\r\nlarge, the judgment of the management should be the\r\n\r\ndecisive one because if its judgment is erratic and\r\n\r\nill-informed  the enterprise sooner or  later  goes\r\n\r\nbankrupt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that management rights cannot be\r\n\r\nabused  or  improperly or unintelligently exercised\r\n\r\nby  management. We have, therefore,  in  this  Bill\r\n\r\nprovided such safeguards as we can against flagrant\r\n\r\nabuse  of  management rights, but laws have  to  be\r\n\r\ndesigned for normal behaviour. It is reasonable  to\r\n\r\nassume that most employers are interested, as  most\r\n\r\nworkers are, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nefficiently   managed   and  therefore   profitable\r\n\r\nenterprises. One cannot make laws on the assumption\r\n\r\nthat  employers  are going into business  with  the\r\n\r\nprimary  objective of hiring, firing and  promoting\r\n\r\nworkers arbitrarily and unfairly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abuses and malpractices there will always be, and\r\n\r\ninroads  into rights and privileges will always  be\r\n\r\nmade  by  one  party  or the other  which,  in  the\r\n\r\nultimate,  can  become detrimental  to  the  public\r\n\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Relations Ordinance, which was\r\n\r\nenacted  in  1960, gives expression to Government's\r\n\r\ndeclared  policy of industrial peace with  justice.\r\n\r\nThough the law has worked satisfactorily generally,\r\n\r\nexperience   in  working  it  has  shown   that   a\r\n\r\nreappraisal  is  necessary  to  eliminate   certain\r\n\r\nfundamental  areas  of latent  dispute  which  have\r\n\r\ncaused  serious concern to us, because in  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  cases this has resulted  in  shattering\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  Singapore's ability to  create  the\r\n\r\nnecessary    conditions    to    attract    foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments, encourage industrial development,  and\r\n\r\ngenerate  much-needed employment opportunities  for\r\n\r\nour people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you some figures of work stoppages\r\n\r\nfrom  1960 to 1967, that is, during the last  seven\r\n\r\nyears.  The  total number of stoppages during  this\r\n\r\nperiod  of  some eight years was 389,  involving  a\r\n\r\nloss  in man-days of 1,284,029; the peak years were\r\n\r\nof course 1961, 1962 and 1963. It will be seen that\r\n\r\nthe  number of man-days lost is colossal. It  is  a\r\n\r\nloss  which  could have crippled a country  of  our\r\n\r\nsize  and in our position, but fortunately  because\r\n\r\nwe  in Singapore are made of sterner stuff, we have\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  survive. What is even more interesting\r\n\r\nis  a study of the causes of these disputes. Of the\r\n\r\ntotal  of  389 disputes, 106 or about 27  per  cent\r\n\r\narose  out of dismissals while another 120 or about\r\n\r\n30 per cent were due to a number of other reasons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  included  demotion, discontinuance  of  life\r\n\r\ninsurance   scheme,   discrimination   in   filling\r\n\r\nvacancy,  grading of staff, recruitment of workers,\r\n\r\nreorganisation, transfer of company doctor, warning\r\n\r\nletters, and not least of all, a union's demand for\r\n\r\ndismissal  of an employee. These disputes  indicate\r\n\r\nthat   there   is  no  clear  demarcation   between\r\n\r\nmanagement functions and trade union functions. One\r\n\r\ncan  seriously  ask  whether in  such  a  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs any new employer would set up factories  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  if  there  is  no  clear  dividing  line\r\n\r\nbetween   the  functions  of  management  and   the\r\n\r\nfunctions of trade unions. This Bill is therefore a\r\n\r\nbid  to create the necessary framework within which\r\n\r\ncertain industrial matters between the employer and\r\n\r\nworker  can  find  a new basis for  a  new  working\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the major clauses of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend section 16 of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance by providing that a trade  union  of\r\n\r\nemployees, the majority of whose members consist of\r\n\r\nemployees working in subordinate positions, may not\r\n\r\nseek recognition in respect of employees who are in\r\n\r\nmanagerial  or  executive positions.  The  existing\r\n\r\nprovisions of subsection (2) of section  6  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  merely stipulate that a trade  union  of\r\n\r\nemployees,  whose  constitution and  rules  do  not\r\n\r\npermit  it  to  admit  as  members  any  class   of\r\n\r\nemployees,  may not seek recognition in respect  of\r\n\r\nthat  class of employees. But the constitution  and\r\n\r\nrules of a trade union may be drafted so widely  as\r\n\r\nto  embrace all grades and categories of  employees\r\n\r\nfrom the office boy up to the managing director. In\r\n\r\nany   commercial  or  industrial  undertaking,  the\r\n\r\nsupervisory  category  of employees  constitutes  a\r\n\r\nminority of the total number of employees. A  trade\r\n\r\nunion  ostensibly works on the democratic principle\r\n\r\nthat  the  will  of  the  majority  prevails,   but\r\n\r\nsometimes  this principle cuts across the interests\r\n\r\nof  the minority. As the minority of employees  are\r\n\r\nin supervisory or executive grades, one often finds\r\n\r\nthat  such  a  principle is incompatible  with  the\r\n\r\nenforcement of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscipline.   And  discipline  is   undeniably   a\r\n\r\nnecessary  prerequisite for effective and efficient\r\n\r\nmanagement.  Separate representation  of  different\r\n\r\ncategories  of  employees is  nothing  new  and  is\r\n\r\naccepted in the highly industrialised countries  of\r\n\r\nEurope  and  America.  Further,  it  has  been  our\r\n\r\nexperience  that  the provisions  of  the  existing\r\n\r\nsection  16  of the Industrial Relations  Ordinance\r\n\r\nhave not been effective in minimising the incidence\r\n\r\nof   disputes  on  the  question  of  trade   union\r\n\r\nrepresentation  which,  in practice,  attempted  to\r\n\r\nembrace  managerial or executive  employees.  There\r\n\r\nis,  therefore, a need for legislative intervention\r\n\r\nin this regard to regularise the position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 17 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and a new subsection is now included  to\r\n\r\nprovide   that   certain   fundamental   management\r\n\r\nfunctions  are not negotiable. These functions  are\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the promotion of an employee;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the internal transfer of an employee;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the recruitment of staff;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the retrenchment of an employee;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) the dismissal or reinstatement of an employee;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) the assignment or allocation of duties or\r\n\r\nspecific tasks to an employee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is undoubtedly true that such functions are\r\n\r\ncommon  law  rights and that, therefore,  it  would\r\n\r\nappear unnecessary to give further legal effect  to\r\n\r\nsuch  rights.  However, as I said,  experience  has\r\n\r\nshown  that  the line between management  functions\r\n\r\nand  trade union functions becomes blurred  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of heated negotiations, with neither  side\r\n\r\nknowing  where one's right begins or ends.  It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   necessary  to  define   clearly   what\r\n\r\nmanagement  functions are, just as it is  important\r\n\r\nto  delineate trade union functions to eliminate an\r\n\r\narea  of  dispute  which  has  caused  considerable\r\n\r\nconcern in regard to the industrial progress\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. But unfettered  rights  there\r\n\r\ncannot be, because rights also beget obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers are subject to human failings just as\r\n\r\ntrade unions are, and these human failings can lead\r\n\r\nto  aberrations.  It  is, therefore,  necessary  to\r\n\r\nbuild   in   certain  safeguards  to  protect   the\r\n\r\nemployees.  For instance, the right of an  employer\r\n\r\nto   transfer  an  employee  is  subject   to   the\r\n\r\nrequirement that the exercise of such a right  does\r\n\r\nnot entail a change to the detriment of an employee\r\n\r\nin regard to his terms of employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the right of an employer to terminate\r\n\r\nthe  services of an employee can only be  exercised\r\n\r\non  the grounds of redundancy or reorganisation  of\r\n\r\nthe employer's profession, business, trade or work.\r\n\r\nThe  trade  unions, however, have apprehensions  in\r\n\r\nthis  regard. In view of the fact that retrenchment\r\n\r\ncan   only  be  carried  out  on  the  grounds   of\r\n\r\nredundancy  or  reorganisation, the  employer  will\r\n\r\nhave in fact to show that this is so. What the Bill\r\n\r\nintends  to  achieve is merely  that  the  employer\r\n\r\nshould have the prerogative to decide which of  his\r\n\r\nemployees  should go, not just on the principle  of\r\n\r\n\"last in, first out\", but more on the principle  of\r\n\r\n\"least efficient, first out\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employer would naturally want to retain\r\n\r\nefficient workers if be wants to run his enterprise\r\n\r\nsuccessfully. The principle of \"last in, first out\"\r\n\r\nprevents him from retaining useful employees  in  a\r\n\r\nredundancy  or reorganisation exercise.  The  fears\r\n\r\nexpressed  in this regard are, therefore,  somewhat\r\n\r\nexaggerated  because in any case of  abuse  by  the\r\n\r\nemployers,  remedial  measures  can  be  instituted\r\n\r\nunder  section 72 if the circumstances warrant  the\r\n\r\nappointment of a Board of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the right of an employer to dismiss an\r\n\r\nemployee  is  subject  to  certain  restraints   as\r\n\r\nprovided for in an amendment to section 34  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance as embodied in paragraph\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) of clause 8. An employee dismissed without just\r\n\r\ncause  or  excuse  by an employer may,  within  one\r\n\r\nmonth  of  his  dismissal, make through  his  trade\r\n\r\nunion,  representations in writing to the  Minister\r\n\r\nto  be  reinstated  in his former  employment.  The\r\n\r\npurpose  of  directing  dismissal  cases   to   the\r\n\r\nMinister is to provide for more speedy machinery to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  individual cases of  dismissal  and  to\r\n\r\nprevent the Industrial Arbitration Court from being\r\n\r\nbogged  down  by prolonged arguments over  isolated\r\n\r\ncases. If the objective of the Bill is achieved and\r\n\r\nhigh  employment created, we can expect the  supply\r\n\r\nof  jobs  to  outrun the demand for  jobs.  Such  a\r\n\r\nsituation  would  be  a natural  bar  to  employers\r\n\r\nwanting  to  terminate  the services  of  employees\r\n\r\nbecause employees will be able to choose jobs  from\r\n\r\nseveral alternatives that are open to them. In  any\r\n\r\ncase,  the more efficient and useful a worker,  the\r\n\r\nless are the chances of his losing employment,  and\r\n\r\nimproved performance and productivity will become a\r\n\r\nnatural deterrent to unjust dismissals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, whilst the employer is given the right\r\n\r\nto  assign or allocate duties or specific tasks  to\r\n\r\nan  employee, this right is qualified by  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  such  assignment or allocation  must  be  con\r\n\r\nsistent or compatible with the terms of employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 24 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to  provide  that  the  duration  of   a\r\n\r\ncollective  agreement should be for  a  minimum  of\r\n\r\nthree  years and a maximum of five years as against\r\n\r\nthe  existing provisions for a minimum of 18 months\r\n\r\nand  a maximum of three years. The reason for  this\r\n\r\nextension  is to enable stability to be  maintained\r\n\r\nin the level of terms and conditions of service for\r\n\r\na longer period. This would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlead to more effective and efficient administration\r\n\r\nof  an undertaking and enable entrepreneurs to plan\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.
