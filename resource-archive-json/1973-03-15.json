I will talk about  bus\r\n\r\nshelters again today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I fully agree in principle with the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Communications  that  this   is   a\r\n\r\nquestion of priority, and that the profits of  bus\r\n\r\noperators should at present be ploughed  back  for\r\n\r\nthe purchase of new buses and other rolling stock,\r\n\r\nI  still  feel that there is a lot yet to be  done\r\n\r\nfor our bus commuters generally. I would therefore\r\n\r\nlike   to   turn  to  the  Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and urge his Ministry  to  look  into\r\n\r\nthese questions again to see if his Ministry could\r\n\r\nexpedite  the provision of bus shelters  to  those\r\n\r\nbus  stops  which do not as yet have any  form  of\r\n\r\nshelters  at  all  at  the moment,  especially  in\r\n\r\nhighly populated residential areas created by  his\r\n\r\nMinistry.  First,  I would like to  suggest,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the Ministry should try to secure additional\r\n\r\nfunds for the construction of as many bus shelters\r\n\r\nas  possible  within the shortest  possible  time,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  existing Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  estates. Toa Payoh New Town is  a  case  in\r\n\r\npoint,  where  bus  commuters  have  been  put  to\r\n\r\nunnecessary inconvenience for the last few  years.\r\n\r\nSecond,  Sir,  is  the transfer  of  part  of  the\r\n\r\nexecutive functions of the PWD to the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board. I would like to  suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  and Development Board  should,  when\r\n\r\nconstructing new housing estates or new  towns  in\r\n\r\nfuture, be responsible for the construction of bus\r\n\r\nshelters,  instead of the present  practice  where\r\n\r\nthe PWD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstructs these shelters years after the  estates\r\n\r\nwere  completed.  This  is  to  ensure  that   bus\r\n\r\nshelters are provided for bus commuters as part of\r\n\r\nessential  facilities,  just  as  car  parks   are\r\n\r\nprovided  for  private car owners in  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   as   a  Member   of   Parliament\r\n\r\nrepresenting a rural constituency, I would like to\r\n\r\ntouch  upon  the pressing problems of the  kampung\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are all very glad that over the recent\r\n\r\nyears  there  have  been  political  and  economic\r\n\r\nstability,  commercial and industrial  prosperity,\r\n\r\nas  well  as  an  improvement in the  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.  The Government has one unchanging policy,\r\n\r\ni.e, to try its best to narrow the gap between the\r\n\r\nrich  and  the poor, and to do away with  all  the\r\n\r\nslums.  According to the results achieved  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  the past decade, we are  confident\r\n\r\nthat  one day our people will be able to enjoy  as\r\n\r\ngood  a  life as possible. In fact, the people  in\r\n\r\nthe  suburban  areas  are now  enjoying  the  same\r\n\r\nstandard of living as those in the urban areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are still some people living in\r\n\r\ndilapidated  attap  huts;  the  whole  family   is\r\n\r\ncrammed  in  a dilapidated attap hut.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthey  also  want to save up and move into  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flats  so as to enjoy better conditions  of\r\n\r\nliving, and where sanitary and other amenities are\r\n\r\nbetter.  However, the policy of the Housing  Board\r\n\r\nin  the  allocation of flats is \"first come  first\r\n\r\nserved\". There is no favouritism. Of course, I  am\r\n\r\nnot  disputing this. However, I must say  that  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  the high building rate of  the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  in  the  past few years - one housing  unit\r\n\r\nevery 40 to 50 minutes - there is still a shortage\r\n\r\nof  flats. This means that the supply is less than\r\n\r\nthe  demand,  and so for the immediate  future  we\r\n\r\ncannot meet the housing needs of the people. Under\r\n\r\nthese  circumstances,  the  people  in  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome group have no alternative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nbut to continue to live in dilapidated attap huts,\r\n\r\nwhich are like dungeons. This is a fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, attap huts differ widely from brick and\r\n\r\ncement houses. An attap hut is built of plank  and\r\n\r\nattap,  and therefore gets damaged easily after  a\r\n\r\nperiod of inclement weather. So from time to time,\r\n\r\nit  needs to be repaired, for which the consent of\r\n\r\nthe  landlord  will have to be sought.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany dilapidated huts and houses, with the pillars\r\n\r\nand  beams  in a state of near-collapse.  However,\r\n\r\nwithout  getting the sympathetic approval  of  the\r\n\r\nlandlord,  the tenant simply cannot or  would  not\r\n\r\ndare  repair  such  a  house.  Some  tenants  have\r\n\r\napproached the Planning Department, or the  proper\r\n\r\nauthority, for permission to repair the house, but\r\n\r\nwithout any success. In the meantime the holes  in\r\n\r\nthe roof are growing bigger, the pillars and beams\r\n\r\nless firm, and the walls begin to crack. Living in\r\n\r\nsuch  a structure is not only unhygienic, but also\r\n\r\ndangerous. While there is prosperity in all fields\r\n\r\nof economic activity and our standard of living is\r\n\r\nimproving  every  year,  the  existence  of  these\r\n\r\ndilapidated   houses   is   a   blemish   to   our\r\n\r\nenvironment. It is a smear in the rosy picture  of\r\n\r\nour   economic   progress.  So   the   authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned should try to remedy this situation  for\r\n\r\nthe  sake  of our people, and thereby  erase  this\r\n\r\nblemish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the fact that the Housing Board is\r\n\r\ngoing  all out to build as many flats as possible,\r\n\r\nmany  applicants still have to wait for  at  least\r\n\r\nthree  years or more before any flat is  allocated\r\n\r\nto  them. Sir, immediate needs cannot be solved by\r\n\r\nlong-term  plans or measures. Since landowners  do\r\n\r\nnot  allow  tenants  to repair  their  dilapidated\r\n\r\nhouses,   the  Government  should  exercise   some\r\n\r\nflexibility in the control of repairs  to  houses.\r\n\r\nOf  course, Sir, I do not mean that these  tenants\r\n\r\nshould  be  allowed to rebuild their  houses  with\r\n\r\nmaterials other than the original, so as to change\r\n\r\nthe structure entirely. What I have in mind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  that tenants should be allowed to repair their\r\n\r\nattap  roof  with  attap  material.  This   is   a\r\n\r\nreasonable  request, and the landlords should  not\r\n\r\nbe  unreasonable. They should not deny the tenants\r\n\r\nthe  permission  to  carry out  repairs  to  their\r\n\r\nhouses because in the first instance the landlords\r\n\r\nhad  given their consent to the tenants  to  build\r\n\r\nhouses on their property. The landlords should  he\r\n\r\nmore  humane and reasonable. The Government should\r\n\r\nlook  after the affairs of the people.  It  should\r\n\r\nsympathise with their predicament and try to solve\r\n\r\ntheir problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the suggestion that I am going\r\n\r\nto  make  is  practicable. I think  this  sort  of\r\n\r\napplication  can  be  referred  to  the  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative    Committee   of   the    respective\r\n\r\nconstituency.  Perhaps they can be entrusted  with\r\n\r\nthe  task  of helping these people. The  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative    Committee   can    consider    any\r\n\r\napplication  for  the repair  of  an  attap  house\r\n\r\nbecause they are in close contact with the  people\r\n\r\nin  the  locality. They are in a position to  know\r\n\r\nwhat  kind  of  material is  to  be  used  in  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  the  house in question.  If  such  a\r\n\r\nprocedure  can  be  devised by the  Government,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  will go a long way towards solving  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of the rural people. The Government  will\r\n\r\nalso get their full support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mean to say that we should supervise\r\n\r\nthe  work  of the department concerned, for  which\r\n\r\nthe  Minister is responsible. I have  raised  this\r\n\r\nquestion in this House because I have come  across\r\n\r\nmany  such instances and have consulted  with  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  concerned  but  without  any   result.\r\n\r\nTherefore I have raised this matter in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in the Housing and Development Board  Annual\r\n\r\nReport  it was stated that (a) the Board has  been\r\n\r\ndirected mainly towards planning and building more\r\n\r\nand  better houses in an improved environment; (b)\r\n\r\nthat  with  effect  from  1st  January,  1972  the\r\n\r\ndefects liability period assumed by the Board  has\r\n\r\nbeen  extended  from  six  months  to  12  months.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Board has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  taken  steps to ensure that contractors  can\r\n\r\ncarry   out   their   contracts  efficiently   and\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily.  All these are indeed  commendable\r\n\r\nmoves  on  the part of the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard. We all agree, Sir, that over the years  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board has made tremendous\r\n\r\nprogress in the field of public housing and  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal. Prices and rentals of flats built by  the\r\n\r\nBoard  have  remained static for many years.  This\r\n\r\nhas   in  no  small  measure  contributed   to   a\r\n\r\nsuccessful  check on inflation. However,  Sir,  as\r\n\r\nstated  in  the  report there is  still  room  for\r\n\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to touch\r\n\r\non  some problems which, I hope, will receive  the\r\n\r\nconsideration of the Minister. On the question  of\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of flats constructed by the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board, I would like to  bring  to\r\n\r\nthe notice of the Minister the poor quality in the\r\n\r\nconstruction   and  finishing  of   the   recently\r\n\r\nconstructed  six-storey blocks  of  flats  in  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  Central. The windows in these flats are  of\r\n\r\nthe  old-fashioned wooden louvred types  that  are\r\n\r\nvery  common  in Chinatown. Many of these  windows\r\n\r\ncannot  be properly closed as the latches are  not\r\n\r\nproperly  aligned. The floors are uneven  and  the\r\n\r\ndoors  cannot be properly closed. In  one  of  the\r\n\r\nflats,  two  doors have had to be replaced.  These\r\n\r\ndefects  show up only after some time has elapsed,\r\n\r\nusually  12 months after the occupiers have  moved\r\n\r\nin. These defects may be caused by the weather  or\r\n\r\nnegligence on the part of the contractors. I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board will conduct  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  of  these flats and put right the  defects\r\n\r\nmentioned  and,  if  necessary,  take  appropriate\r\n\r\naction against the contractors responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the system of tendering rentals\r\n\r\nfor  shop houses and hawker stalls in the  Housing\r\n\r\nand    Development   Board   estates   has    some\r\n\r\ndisadvantages. This is especially evident  in  the\r\n\r\ntendered  rentals for eating houses.  The  minimum\r\n\r\nrental for an eating house set by the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board is usually $770 per month, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  has  been tendered for as much as  $3,000  per\r\n\r\nmonth. In order to recover the costs and also make\r\n\r\na  profit,  the tenants sub-let as many stalls  as\r\n\r\nthe  shop  houses can accommodate, at  rentals  of\r\n\r\n$100 or $300 each per month, depending on the type\r\n\r\nof  food  sold. As a result, the tenants and  sub-tenants\r\n\r\noften encroach on public areas, like five-foot\r\n\r\nways  and  even car parks. The  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board is therefore compelled  to  take\r\n\r\naction  against such offenders much to the chagrin\r\n\r\nof the stall-holders and the residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of hawker centres, the rentals\r\n\r\nare  fair and there is no distinction. It  is  $35\r\n\r\neach  per month for all categories of food-stalls,\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  whether the  tenant  sells  ice-water,\r\n\r\nkachang  puteh, or runs a mini-restaurant.\r\n\r\nPreviously  the rental was $55 for  a  stall,  but\r\n\r\nthis was reduced on account of a subsidy given  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government. Sir, I would say that the subsidy\r\n\r\nis  not  utilised to best advantage. I would  have\r\n\r\nthought that the money so allocated should be used\r\n\r\nto  build  more hawker centres to accommodate  the\r\n\r\nmany  hawkers who are still plying in the streets.\r\n\r\nSome hawkers are very affluent. However, I am  not\r\n\r\nagainst successful hawkers as such, In fact,  this\r\n\r\nis  a  good sign of progress. They can send  their\r\n\r\nchildren  for  higher studies and enjoy  the  good\r\n\r\nthings in life. However, they should not be  on  a\r\n\r\nsubsidy.  Subsidies should only be given to  cases\r\n\r\nof  hardship, for example, those receiving welfare\r\n\r\nassistance, those affected by resettlement, widows\r\n\r\nand  physically handicapped persons. To illustrate\r\n\r\nmy point, I would inform the House that near Block\r\n\r\n18   in  Toa  Payoh,  which  was  formerly  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency  but  it  is  now  in  the  Kim  Keat\r\n\r\nconstituency, there are two stalls selling Hokkien\r\n\r\nmee.  They are barely ten feet apart. One  pays  a\r\n\r\nmonthly rental of $150 to the eating-house tenant,\r\n\r\nand  the  other pays only $35 to the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board. Both stall-holders  are  doing\r\n\r\nvery  well.  Therefore, I would suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board should  in  future\r\n\r\nconsider building hawker centres of various  sizes\r\n\r\nand fix\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  rentals according to the type of  food  sold.\r\n\r\nThis  will  minimise  the anomalies  that  are  so\r\n\r\nevident now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the development of new satellite towns,\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board has endeavoured\r\n\r\nto    provide   adequate   facilities   for    the\r\n\r\nrecreational  needs  of  the  residents,  such  as\r\n\r\nplaygrounds,  sports complexes and other  communal\r\n\r\nfacilities. As an illustration, I would quote some\r\n\r\nprojected population figures as stated in the  HDB\r\n\r\nannual  report:  Queenstown  150,000;  Toa   Payoh\r\n\r\n190,000;  Telok  Blangah 120,000; Bedok  New  Town\r\n\r\n150,000; Kallang Basin New Town 100,000. With more\r\n\r\nand more people moving into these housing estates,\r\n\r\nthere is also a need to provide facilities for our\r\n\r\nyouths.  Other than community centres, the  youths\r\n\r\nhave  no  other  place to go to  for  guidance  on\r\n\r\nrecreational  and social matters. There  are  many\r\n\r\nyouth organisations and voluntary organisations in\r\n\r\nSingapore  which  are prepared to  participate  in\r\n\r\ncommunity activities in housing estates.  But  due\r\n\r\nto  the lack of proper premises they are not  able\r\n\r\nto  perform their community work effectively.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  rightly  identified  the  various\r\n\r\nproblems  faced by our youths, e.g, drug addiction\r\n\r\nand juvenile delinquency, hence, the setting up of\r\n\r\na special committee to look into these problems. I\r\n\r\nthink the Housing and Development Board can play a\r\n\r\nuseful  role  in this direction. The Board  should\r\n\r\nallow  the  various youth organisations and  other\r\n\r\nrecognised  voluntary  organisations  to  set   up\r\n\r\nbranches in housing estates. This could be done by\r\n\r\nconverting  a  portion of the void  areas  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  blocks of flats in housing  estates  into\r\n\r\npremises  and  leasing them to these organisations\r\n\r\nat nominal rentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  can  I  be permitted to raise a  very  small\r\n\r\npoint  in  regard  to the Housing and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  policy? I was thinking of raising it  under\r\n\r\nHead  1401, Ministry of Finance, but I believe  it\r\n\r\nmay  be more appropriate to mention it under  this\r\n\r\nHead?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, while the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board flats cater for the lower income\r\n\r\ngroup,   there  is  a  particular  group   in   my\r\n\r\nconstituency  where this housing scheme  does  not\r\n\r\napply.  I refer, Sir, to the middle income  group.\r\n\r\nAt  the  moment the combined family income of  all\r\n\r\napplicants for Housing Board flats must not exceed\r\n\r\n$1,500  per  month. In the debate  on  the  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement  last week, many Members in  this  House\r\n\r\nspoke  of  the  rising  cost  of  living  and  the\r\n\r\nspeculative rise in prices of private  houses  and\r\n\r\nflats.  Since it is now simply impossible for  the\r\n\r\nmiddle   income  group  to  keep  pace  with   the\r\n\r\nspiralling  prices, I would like  to  suggest  and\r\n\r\nplead  that  the  Housing  and  Development  Board\r\n\r\nshould begin to cater for the middle income group.\r\n\r\nThe  ceiling  of  $1,500 per  month  total  family\r\n\r\nincome  should  therefore  be  raised.  This  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  add  on to the waiting list  of  60,000\r\n\r\napplicants,   and  the  period  of  waiting   will\r\n\r\nprobably  be  longer  than  two  years  for   many\r\n\r\napplicants. But I am sure those applicants in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  income group would not mind the long  wait\r\n\r\nso  long  as they know that finally they  will  be\r\n\r\nable to own a flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise one or two\r\n\r\npoints on this subject. I sympathise with what the\r\n\r\nMember  for Paya Lebar has said just now,  namely,\r\n\r\nthe  plight of unauthorised house dwellers.  There\r\n\r\nare  many  illegal structures in the rural  areas.\r\n\r\nThe  reason is that the rural people were not able\r\n\r\nto  get  the  approval of the Planning  Department\r\n\r\nwhen  they  built  their houses. Therefore,  their\r\n\r\nhouses are now regarded as unauthorised. It  would\r\n\r\nseem  that the authorities concerned have not been\r\n\r\nlooking into their problems. The tenants of  these\r\n\r\nunauthorised  houses  were  able  to  build  their\r\n\r\nhouses  because at first there was no interference\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government. Then after a long lapse  of\r\n\r\ntime,  these houses have fallen into  a  state  of\r\n\r\ndisrepair, and it is only natural that they should\r\n\r\nwant to carry out repairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when they make applications for\r\n\r\nrepairs   to   their  unauthorised   houses,   the\r\n\r\nauthorities  concerned wanted to know  whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  building permission was granted in the  first\r\n\r\nplace.  Otherwise their applications  for  repairs\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  approved. If it is possible,  they\r\n\r\nwould like to rebuild their houses, but they could\r\n\r\nnot do so if they had no money. Therefore, after a\r\n\r\nlapse of one or two years, more and more parts  of\r\n\r\nthe  house would dilapidate and perhaps a  portion\r\n\r\nof  the  building might collapse. So when they  do\r\n\r\nsomething  about  it, the authorities  would  turn\r\n\r\nround  and  say,  \"Your building  is  illegal  and\r\n\r\nunauthorised. You must pull it down.\" Hence,  many\r\n\r\nMembers from the rural constituencies have  raised\r\n\r\nthis  matter  again and again. The occupiers  have\r\n\r\nsaid  that they have lived there for more than  10\r\n\r\nyears and that they only need to do minor repairs.\r\n\r\nIt  is not a newly constructed unauthorised house.\r\n\r\nWe  are put in a very difficult position when  our\r\n\r\nconstituents, who have lived there  for  so  long,\r\n\r\napproach  us. But there are some newly constructed\r\n\r\nunauthorised houses too. I think it is  not  right\r\n\r\nto  allow  such a situation to drag on. We  should\r\n\r\nfind ways and means to help them. I would like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  to the Minister concerned whether  it  is\r\n\r\npossible   for  him,  in  conjunction   with   the\r\n\r\nCitizens'    Consultative   Committee    of    the\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  to  find  out   the   number   of\r\n\r\nunauthorised  houses  in the rural  constituencies\r\n\r\nand their condition. I hope the Minister concerned\r\n\r\nwould consider this matter sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is with regard to flats.\r\n\r\nNowadays, many people hope to purchase flats. Many\r\n\r\nof  them  apply  to purchase three-  or  four-room\r\n\r\nflats.  This shows the success of the Government's\r\n\r\nhome  ownership scheme. Sir, I have come across  a\r\n\r\ncase  where  a block of four-room flats  had  been\r\n\r\nallocated to the purchasers, but more than 90  per\r\n\r\ncent  of them did not move into their flats within\r\n\r\nthe first three months or more. They wanted to lay\r\n\r\nmosaic  on  the floor and carry out some  interior\r\n\r\ndecorations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question I would like to raise is this.\r\n\r\nIn  future, just before the completion of a  block\r\n\r\nof  flats,  will the Government consider allotting\r\n\r\nthe  flats to the purchasers in advance? Inquiries\r\n\r\ncould then be sent out to them to find out whether\r\n\r\nthey  want to have any interior decorations  made.\r\n\r\nOr can permission be granted for the purchasers to\r\n\r\ncarry  out decorations during the final stages  of\r\n\r\nthe  building  construction? I  think  this  is  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  request  and a  practical  suggestion,\r\n\r\nparticularly at a time when we are experiencing  a\r\n\r\nshortage  of  building materials and labour.  This\r\n\r\nwill   save   a  lot  of  unnecessary   additional\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  Otherwise,  in  the  cases  I   have\r\n\r\nreferred  to, the flat owners would  have  to  get\r\n\r\ntheir  own contractors to lay the mosaic  flooring\r\n\r\nor  other  interior decorations.  In  some  cases,\r\n\r\ncement floors have to be chipped in order that the\r\n\r\nnew  flooring  material  could  be  laid  out.  If\r\n\r\neverybody uses the lifts to carry heavy  loads  of\r\n\r\ncement   and   other   building   materials    for\r\n\r\nreflooring, the lifts could be damaged. This is  a\r\n\r\nwaste  of labour and material. Therefore, I  hope,\r\n\r\nin  future, the Housing Board will allow  interior\r\n\r\ndecoration and flooring to be done just before the\r\n\r\ncompletion of a block of flats, as in the case  of\r\n\r\nprivate housing. Arrangements can be made for  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board contractors to lay the new flooring\r\n\r\nmaterial  and  carry  out the interior  decoration\r\n\r\nrequired, at the expense of the purchasers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W.

And we have to make the best\r\n\r\nuse  of  these monies according to the  priorities\r\n\r\nfor bus shelters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present policy is to provide bus shelters,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  near  clinics and  hospitals;  secondly,\r\n\r\nnear schools and, thirdly, in housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also made the suggestion that the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  bus shelters should  be  transferred\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Public Works Department to the  Housing\r\n\r\nand   Development  Board.  This   will   lead   to\r\n\r\ncomplication  because as soon as a housing  estate\r\n\r\nis  built  and the roads are completed and  become\r\n\r\npublic   roads,   they   then   come   under   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the Public  Works  Department.\r\n\r\nMany  Members have made requests for bus  shelters\r\n\r\nin  their  constituencies and have  not  got  them\r\n\r\nwithin  the time they want them. I myself  had  to\r\n\r\nwait  one or two years before getting bus shelters\r\n\r\nin  Tanglin. But there are priorities - priorities\r\n\r\nbetween   constituencies   and   also   within   a\r\n\r\nparticular constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Paya Lebar and Bukit Panjang\r\n\r\nhave   almost  the  same  grouses.  This   is   in\r\n\r\nconnection  with  building  permits  and  planning\r\n\r\npermission. They should be interested to know that\r\n\r\nthe Building Surveyor's Department was reorganised\r\n\r\nand  set up as the Building Control Division under\r\n\r\nthe Public Works Department on the 1st of February\r\n\r\nlast  year. The procedures for obtaining  approval\r\n\r\nfor effecting urgent repairs and minor alterations\r\n\r\nto  attap houses and similar structures have since\r\n\r\nbeen simplified and the application forms revised.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Members are interested, I have copies  of\r\n\r\nthe  application  forms in my file  for  them.  To\r\n\r\nprovide  on-the-spot service  and  advice  to  the\r\n\r\npublic, sub-offices have been established at Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  District  Office (Rural West),  Serangoon\r\n\r\nDistrict Office (Rural Central) and at the  former\r\n\r\nMidwives' Maternity Centre (Rural East)  in  Jalan\r\n\r\nEunos.  To further assist the public, the Building\r\n\r\nControl Division will shortly be issuing a booklet\r\n\r\non  the  do's  and dont's of building activity  to\r\n\r\ninform  the public of the procedures to  be  taken\r\n\r\nbefore any building works are carried out. If  you\r\n\r\nput  up  an unauthorised house five years ago  and\r\n\r\nthen  want  to  renew or repair it, naturally  you\r\n\r\nwould  not  get permission because your  act  five\r\n\r\nyears ago was illegal in the first place. You\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  got  to put that right before you  ask  for\r\n\r\npermission  to carry out repairs. But  there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  many  cases where the original building  was\r\n\r\nauthorised and application is made for repairs  or\r\n\r\nminor  alterations and at the  end  of  which  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  becomes larger or even taller. Then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, the builder is in trouble and runs to  his\r\n\r\nMember of Parliament.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to accept the suggestion that the Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committee  be  given  authority   to\r\n\r\napprove  or  disapprove building plans either  for\r\n\r\nbuilding repairs or renewals might lead to  chaos,\r\n\r\nas  far  as  planning and building  is  concerned.\r\n\r\nEither we have control, or we do not have control.\r\n\r\nMy  sympathies are with the Members of  Parliament\r\n\r\ncomplaining.  I  have  similar  problems   in   my\r\n\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can now deal with the other matters raised\r\n\r\nby  the  Member  for  Bukit  Panjang.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of additions and alterations to  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flats before the purchasers move in.  As  I\r\n\r\nunderstand   him,  balloting  should  take   place\r\n\r\nperhaps  one,  two  or  three  months  before  the\r\n\r\nbuilding is completed so that alterations  can  be\r\n\r\neffected   with  the  least  inconvenience.   This\r\n\r\nappears  to be an admirable suggestion.  This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  done  in  the past. But this also  leads  to\r\n\r\ncomplaints from those who do not want  to  put  in\r\n\r\nany  additions or alterations or those who do  not\r\n\r\nwant mosaic floors. They grumble and say, \"What is\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  selling  me a  flat  if  it  is  not\r\n\r\ncompleted?\"  So  either way we hear  grouses.  The\r\n\r\nMember  himself suggested that, whilst people  are\r\n\r\nin  occupation of the flats, the lifts are used to\r\n\r\ncarry  cement  or  mosaic,  common  corridors  are\r\n\r\nthereby  littered, the lifts themselves get  dirty\r\n\r\nand  even go out of order. This is the reason  why\r\n\r\nthe Housing and Development Board wants to control\r\n\r\nalterations   to  Housing  Board  flats.   Without\r\n\r\ncontrol,  your neighbour upstairs may  be  hitting\r\n\r\nthe  ceiling  down to you. This is why  the  Board\r\n\r\nmust  have some sort of limited control. Otherwise\r\n\r\ntenants  of  other  floors and  other  units  will\r\n\r\ncomplain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can go on to the suggestion by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  River  Valley, he suggests  that  the  income\r\n\r\nlimit  for  buying a Housing Board flat be  raised\r\n\r\nbeyond the present $1,500 a month. Sir, the income\r\n\r\nlimit for home owners was, in fact, increased from\r\n\r\n$1,200 a month to $1,500 a month with effect  from\r\n\r\n1st July, 1971. A few thousand people applied, but\r\n\r\nthey  could only apply for 5-room flats. They have\r\n\r\nwaited more than 18 months. They have not got  any\r\n\r\nflat.  The  first of these few thousand will  only\r\n\r\nget  their  flats  at the end of this  year,  when\r\n\r\nabout  192 units at Farrer Road will be completed.\r\n\r\nTo  increase the income limit would appear  to  be\r\n\r\ndesirable so as to look after the middle class, or\r\n\r\nthe  lower middle class if you like, but this will\r\n\r\nonly lengthen the waiting period and waiting list.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  agree with the Member that  something\r\n\r\nshould be done for this group of people. All I can\r\n\r\nsay  is  that at the moment we cannot do anything.\r\n\r\nThere  are  priorities. The Member for Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\ncomplains that some of his constituents  have  had\r\n\r\nto  wait nearly three years before getting housing\r\n\r\naccommodation. If we were to increase  the  income\r\n\r\nlimit,  I think more Members will grumble  because\r\n\r\ntheir constituents in the lower income groups will\r\n\r\nhave to wait a longer time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps Members are interested in the numbers\r\n\r\nregistered to purchase Housing Board flats. As  at\r\n\r\nlast month, there were 56,000. But I wish to point\r\n\r\nout that of the 56,000, approximately 20,000 or 36\r\n\r\nper  cent  are  already in occupation  of  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard flats. In other words, they are tenants now.\r\n\r\nThey  want  to  better themselves. Their  families\r\n\r\nhave  grown  probably. They are at the  moment  in\r\n\r\noccupation  of  one  or two-room  flats.  So  with\r\n\r\nrising  affluence they get more money, the  family\r\n\r\ngrows,  and  they  want to buy a  bigger  flat.  A\r\n\r\nfurther breakdown of these 20,000 or 36 per  cent,\r\n\r\nwho are already in flats, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 per cent are existing owners wanting to change\r\n\r\ntheir purchased flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24 per cent are existing tenants wanting to\r\n\r\npurchase, instead of renting Housing Board flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 per cent are immediate relatives now staying\r\n\r\nwith registered tenants or owners in Housing Board\r\n\r\nflats,  but  they  want  to  purchase  their   own\r\n\r\nseparate accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining 64 per cent or 36,000 applicants\r\n\r\nare  not living in Housing Board flats. If you add\r\n\r\nthis  figure  to  the 25,000 applicants  who  have\r\n\r\nregistered to rent, the total would exceed 50,000.\r\n\r\nWe hope to build 25,000 or 30,000 units this year.\r\n\r\nIf  we  complete 30,000 units, we would have  done\r\n\r\nwell.  But  then  there is still  the  balance  of\r\n\r\n20,000 and more will register throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThough my sympathies are with the suggestion  made\r\n\r\nby the Member for River Valley, all I can tell him\r\n\r\nnow is: be a little patient; their turn will come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh has registered some\r\n\r\nvalid complaints. He complains about certain  six-storey\r\n\r\nblocks  of flats in Toa Payoh  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  badly constructed. First, I am glad to  note\r\n\r\nthat the Member has pointed out that these defects\r\n\r\nwere not immediately apparent but only arose after\r\n\r\nsome  time. The Member will be happy to note  that\r\n\r\nremedial  action is being taken on the  six-storey\r\n\r\nblocks  referred  to, and the doors,  windows  and\r\n\r\nfloors will be put right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh also suggested that the\r\n\r\nsystem of tendering sometimes does not work out to\r\n\r\nbe  fair  or perhaps practical. Sir, in  order  to\r\n\r\ngive  everybody  a fair chance to  obtain  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  shop  premises, the lettings of  the  shops\r\n\r\nmust  be  by competitive public tender,  otherwise\r\n\r\nyou will have complaints of bias and corruption. I\r\n\r\nwould  be  happy to consider any alternative  fair\r\n\r\nform  of letting out that can be suggested by  any\r\n\r\nMember   of  Parliament.  Because  of   the   keen\r\n\r\ncompetition   for  shops  in  certain   locations,\r\n\r\ntendered rentals are higher than elsewhere. As for\r\n\r\nthe rent of $35 of certain stalls, the subsidy was\r\n\r\ngiven at the persistent request of some Members of\r\n\r\nParliament. I am glad to hear one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\nMember saying now that he is not in favour of this\r\n\r\nsubsidy because it does not work out to be fair in\r\n\r\nall cases. He pointed out the case of two hawkers,\r\n\r\nboth  doing well and one paying $170 a  month  for\r\n\r\nspace  in  a shop and the other paying $35  for  a\r\n\r\nstall  space.  To  withdraw  this  subsidy,  after\r\n\r\nhaving   given  it,  would  only  lead   to   more\r\n\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's other suggestion was to let youth\r\n\r\norganisations  -  perhaps he is  thinking  of  boy\r\n\r\nscouts and girl guides -- occupy some space within\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  so that they  can  organise  and\r\n\r\ncarry  out their activities. This is a good  idea.\r\n\r\nBut  can  I point out that we have been approached\r\n\r\nby  many  organisations - religious organisations,\r\n\r\ncharitable  organisations and other  organisations\r\n\r\nlike the boy scouts - for space within the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  estates.  Frankly, we have not  got  enough\r\n\r\nspace.  To  allow one would be to let in  all  the\r\n\r\nothers.  That would mean less units of  flats  for\r\n\r\nthe people. There is, of course, the suggestion to\r\n\r\nlet them use the open space at the ground floor of\r\n\r\nevery   multi-storey  block  of  flats.  But   the\r\n\r\npractice  of  the Housing Board is to  leave  this\r\n\r\nspace  open and free, and for a good reason: there\r\n\r\nis  fresh  air  and children may move  around.  To\r\n\r\nblock up the space would only be a step backward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have dealt with all the queries, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to offer a suggestion, as invited  by\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  just  now,  with  regard  to   the\r\n\r\ntendering of shop houses in Housing Board estates.\r\n\r\nIn  my  question, I was referring to eating houses\r\n\r\nonly.  As  far  as  shops  or  other  trades   are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the  present system is  working  quite\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily.  But for eating houses,  will  the\r\n\r\nMinister consider restricting the number  of  sub-lettings?\r\n\r\nIn  other words, if the minimum  rental\r\n\r\nfor an eating house is $770 per month depending on\r\n\r\nthe  floor space available, the tenant should  not\r\n\r\nbe allowed to sublet, say, more than four\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  five  hawker stalls. This will then discourage\r\n\r\nthem  from tendering high prices, because it  will\r\n\r\nbe at the expense of the consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is a matter of clarification\r\n\r\nwith  regard to the void area at the foot of  each\r\n\r\nblock of flats in Housing Board estates, which  is\r\n\r\nnow the common practice to leave it open. I am not\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that we block up the  whole  area.  In\r\n\r\nfact, most of the blocks are very large, and there\r\n\r\nis  ample space. What I was suggesting is to allow\r\n\r\na  small  portion of space, sufficient  for  these\r\n\r\norganisations  to use it as a base of  operations.\r\n\r\nThis  will  help  to encourage  them  to  organise\r\n\r\nactivities which can be conducted in the remaining\r\n\r\nvoid areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  just  now that the procedure for repairs  to\r\n\r\nattap houses and so on has been simplified. I want\r\n\r\nto   find  out  from  the  Minister  whether   the\r\n\r\nsimplified procedure has removed the need for  the\r\n\r\nconsent  of  the  owner for  repair  works  to  he\r\n\r\ncarried  out. Some landlords are very unreasonable\r\n\r\nand  they simply refuse to sign the form  for  the\r\n\r\nrepairs. They just simply refuse to sign. In  some\r\n\r\nother  cases,  the  landowner  may  be  away  from\r\n\r\nSingapore. So if the tenant were to wait  for  the\r\n\r\nlandlord  to  return to sign the form,  what  will\r\n\r\nhappen  to the attap house which is in a state  of\r\n\r\ndisrepair?  My question is, can the  procedure  be\r\n\r\nrevised  in such a way as to remove the  need  for\r\n\r\nthe  landlord's signature so that repair work  can\r\n\r\nbe carried out immediately?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampung Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\ninterested  in the reply given by the Minister  in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the question raised by the Member  for\r\n\r\nKim Keat. The Minister has said that the money for\r\n\r\nbus  shelters would have to be spent on a priority\r\n\r\nbasis. He also said that priority was to he  given\r\n\r\nto   bus  shelters  near  clinics,  hospitals  and\r\n\r\nschools. Sir, I had made a request three years ago\r\n\r\nfor  bus shelters near Still Road Clinic, near the\r\n\r\nTelok Kurau Secondary School, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Jalan  Daud and Jalan Eunos primary  schools,\r\n\r\nbut I wonder why they have not been erected. These\r\n\r\nare places which the Minister has considered to be\r\n\r\npriorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, the roads in these places are\r\n\r\nalso  in a state of disrepair. When it rains,  the\r\n\r\nwater  is splashed by passing vehicles on  to  bus\r\n\r\npassengers.  So pedestrians or bus commuters  have\r\n\r\nto  avoid standing near these puddles of water,  I\r\n\r\nwant  an assurance from the Minister as to whether\r\n\r\nor not he will give priority to erect bus shelters\r\n\r\nat the places I have mentioned just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I fully sympathise with the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Paya  Lebar in connection with his complaints\r\n\r\nagainst  the necessity for landlords to put  their\r\n\r\nsignatures  on  applications  for  repairs  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried out. Sir, since you are not there  to  see\r\n\r\nfor  yourself,  it is very difficult  for  you  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the hardships suffered by the  people.\r\n\r\nSome   landlords  simply  refuse   to   sign   the\r\n\r\napplication, as indicated by the Member  for  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar. Sometimes the landlords resort to extorting\r\n\r\nmoney  from tenants who want to carry out  repairs\r\n\r\nto  their houses. They demand exorbitant  sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney  before  they  put their  signature  on  the\r\n\r\ndocument. So if the poor rural people have not got\r\n\r\nenough  money, the landowners will  not  sign  the\r\n\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister also mentioned\r\n\r\njust  now  that  buildings must be  controlled.  I\r\n\r\nagree  with  him that there must be some  form  of\r\n\r\ncontrol.  But, at the same time, we must not  only\r\n\r\nlook  at  the legal side of the matter,  but  also\r\n\r\nthink of the human side of it. Some of these attap\r\n\r\ndwellers are living under difficult conditions. In\r\n\r\nfact, I have come across one such case. So I  took\r\n\r\na  picture of this house which was in a  state  of\r\n\r\ngreat  disrepair and dangerous for people to  live\r\n\r\nin. I then wrote to the Minister about it and,  in\r\n\r\nthe end, some arrangements were made. There can be\r\n\r\nother similar cases, or cases\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  the house is badly damaged. There may  also\r\n\r\nbe  cases of attap dwellers who, with better means\r\n\r\nwould  want to provide their families with  better\r\n\r\namenities.   So   they  ask  for   permission   to\r\n\r\nreconstruct  the  building and to  partition  more\r\n\r\nrooms   within   the  same  space.   But   usually\r\n\r\npermission is not granted. So they have no choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are cases where about 30 people live\r\n\r\nin  a  house occupying only 1,000 square  feet  of\r\n\r\nland.  The  place is definitely overcrowded.  They\r\n\r\nhave  no choice but to stay in it. So they  extend\r\n\r\nthe existing house illegally to get more rooms.  1\r\n\r\nhope   the  Minister  will  consider  such   cases\r\n\r\nsympathetically. In the case where the size  of  a\r\n\r\nfamily   has  increased  considerably,  permission\r\n\r\nshould be granted to them to partition more rooms.\r\n\r\nTheir lot should be improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister also said that if the CCC is\r\n\r\ngiven  the  power  to deal with  applications  for\r\n\r\nrepairs   and  so  on,  there  may  be  chaos   or\r\n\r\nconfusion.  However, I think  the  CCC  should  at\r\n\r\nleast  be permitted to do something, such  as  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of certifying the existence of  the\r\n\r\nunauthorised  houses, some of which  were  put  up\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  So the CCC would be able  to  certify\r\n\r\nthis  fact.  I  think  that is  quite  proper  and\r\n\r\nadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by the Member for Paya Lebar, CCC\r\n\r\nmembers  are supposed to be the community  leaders\r\n\r\nwho  have  been living in the area for many  years\r\n\r\nand  they are quite acquainted with the conditions\r\n\r\nthere.  They  know  what is going  on.  So  if  an\r\n\r\nunauthorised house has been in existence for  many\r\n\r\nyears, and if it is certified by the relevant CCC,\r\n\r\nthen  I  think their applications should be  given\r\n\r\nsympathetic consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  refer  to my earlier remarks  about  the\r\n\r\nconstruction   of  bus  shelters.   I   was   only\r\n\r\nsuggesting that the Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nshould,   in  future,  be  responsible   for   the\r\n\r\nprovision of bus shelters in new satellite  towns.\r\n\r\nThis is because I cannot under-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nstand  why millions of dollars had been  spent  by\r\n\r\nthe Housing and Development Board on the provision\r\n\r\nof  car parks in Housing Board estates, and not  a\r\n\r\nsingle cent has been spent on the provision of bus\r\n\r\nshelters.  In this respect, I wonder  whether  bus\r\n\r\ncommuters  are regarded as second-class  Citizens.\r\n\r\nWhy  do we look after the haves, who own cars, and\r\n\r\nneglect the have-nots who have to depend on public\r\n\r\ntransport   and   whose  continued   support   and\r\n\r\npatronage of public transport services is much  to\r\n\r\nbe  welcomed? I think they deserve the comfort and\r\n\r\nconvenience I have suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My plea is to ask the Ministry to make the lives\r\n\r\nof  bus commuters less miserable than what  it  is\r\n\r\ntoday.  I  believe a senior member of the  Housing\r\n\r\nand Development Board sits on the Board of the Bus\r\n\r\nServices Licensing Authority, and therefore  there\r\n\r\nshould   be   no   difficulty  in   planning   and\r\n\r\nestablishing   bus  routes  and   allocating   bus\r\n\r\nshelters in new public housing estates. I do  feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  Housing  and Development  Board  should\r\n\r\nprovide  bus shelters as they have been  providing\r\n\r\ncar  parks in Housing Board estates. I would  like\r\n\r\nto ask if the Minister concerned is satisfied with\r\n\r\nthe  present  state of affairs in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nprovision of bus shelters in Housing Board estates\r\n\r\ncreated  by  his Ministry, and if  he  would  take\r\n\r\nsteps to improve the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I will deal with the last Member\r\n\r\nfirst.  I  think he has got the wrong end  of  the\r\n\r\nstick. I explained earlier why it was the PWD that\r\n\r\nbuilt bus shelters. It is because bus shelters are\r\n\r\non  public  roads,  the responsibility  for  which\r\n\r\nfalls  on the PWD. Hence, car parks within housing\r\n\r\nestates  are  the responsibility  of  the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard.   The   Housing   Board   also   does   not\r\n\r\ndiscriminate between the haves and the  have-nots.\r\n\r\nOtherwise  they  would not  be  building  so  many\r\n\r\nflats.  To  suggest  that  tenants  with  cars  in\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  estates  are  the  haves  is  also\r\n\r\nperhaps  not true. Otherwise they should also  not\r\n\r\nbe living in Housing Board estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for permits to renew or repair premises the\r\n\r\nrule is that if you want to build a new house,  or\r\n\r\nto  reconstruct a house, or to effect  substantial\r\n\r\nalterations  to  a  building,  you  must  get  the\r\n\r\nowner's  permission.  If the  repairs  are  merely\r\n\r\nrepairs  to  the  roof, you will not  require  the\r\n\r\nowner's  permission. We realise that  some  owners\r\n\r\nwill  not  give permission. There is a  law  which\r\n\r\nsays that you cannot build on someone else's land.\r\n\r\nTo  get  rid of this law will not be fair  to  the\r\n\r\nowners.  If  you  build an unauthorised  house  on\r\n\r\nsomeone's land, he will not put his signature to a\r\n\r\npermit either to renew, repair, or rebuild. But we\r\n\r\ndo  enforce  the law with humanity. As the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong has pointed out, he has referred cases\r\n\r\nto  me.  We  have  been rather  lenient.  We  have\r\n\r\npostponed   demolitions.  We  have  extended   the\r\n\r\nperiods. But it is part of the Member's job to get\r\n\r\nthese extensions, and it is part of my job to  run\r\n\r\nthe   department,  and  sometimes  we   agree   to\r\n\r\npostponements of demolitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can now briefly deal with the Member for\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh.

The clearance exercise  by  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice has been carried out recently. Hundreds  of\r\n\r\nfamilies and shops will be affected. Sir,  no  one\r\n\r\nin his right mind will go against the Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  of development of this village.

Govindaswamy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Primary Production Department has done\r\n\r\na  lot  to  promote  the poultry  and  pig-rearing\r\n\r\nindustry.  To  a certain extent it has  helped  to\r\n\r\nlower  the cost of living and to make poultry  and\r\n\r\npigs  an  export  commodity. We  have  been  self-sufficient\r\n\r\nin  these  two  items  of  production.\r\n\r\nRecently  orchid growing has been  encouraged  and\r\n\r\npromoted,  and people in the rural areas  are  now\r\n\r\ngrowing  orchids and exporting them. In this  way,\r\n\r\nwe  have  been  able to earn considerable  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange. However, the cultivation of orchids  has\r\n\r\ngiven  rise  to  the  question  of  land.  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived  complaints  from the  farmers  that  the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department does not allow  them\r\n\r\nto cultivate orchids around the Sembawang Research\r\n\r\nStation  because the Department itself is carrying\r\n\r\nout  a  large  scale experiment on orchid  growing\r\n\r\nthere.  Therefore, the farmers are not allowed  to\r\n\r\ngrow orchids around that area. I feel that this is\r\n\r\nnot   right.   Although  the  Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment has other plans too, I feel that before\r\n\r\nthey  are implemented, the farmers should be given\r\n\r\ntemporary permits to carry on with their  business\r\n\r\nof orchid growing so that their income will not be\r\n\r\naffected. When the Department decides to carry out\r\n\r\nits  programme, it will then not be  too  late  to\r\n\r\nstop  the farmers from growing orchids around  the\r\n\r\nstation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  should  implement  a  scheme  to  grow\r\n\r\nvegetables  on a big scale. Most of the vegetables\r\n\r\nwe  consume are imported from abroad. The cost  of\r\n\r\nvegetables   is  rising.  Formerly   a   kati   of\r\n\r\nvegetables  costs only 20 cents; now it  costs  80\r\n\r\ncents  per  kati.  It  seems  that  the  price  of\r\n\r\nvegetables will continue to rise. This will affect\r\n\r\nthe  livelihood of the people. Since  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department has done quite well  in  the\r\n\r\nrearing  of  pigs and poultry, I think  it  should\r\n\r\ncarry  out  research to find out the best  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich to grow vegetables. It should encourage our\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfarmers  to  grow vegetables on a big  scale,  and\r\n\r\nshould give them more land to grow vegetables.

This  has\r\n\r\nresulted in higher costs to the farmers, and  they\r\n\r\ntherefore suffer a loss of income. Has the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department taken  steps  to  help  the\r\n\r\npoultry and pig-rearing farmers by finding out the\r\n\r\nreason  for  the increase in the price  of  animal\r\n\r\nfeed, and whether such a price hike is justified?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  draw  the  attention of the  Minister  to  the\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  inshore illegal trawlers  along  the\r\n\r\neast  coast.

It is regrettable  to\r\n\r\nnote  that even now they are still operating; thus\r\n\r\ndestroying  the fishing nets, crab  nets  and  the\r\n\r\npupus, or fishing traps, of our inshore fishermen.\r\n\r\nSir, even the spawns of fish were destroyed in the\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Citizens' Consultative Committee,\r\n\r\nthrough   the  Katong  District  Office,   and   I\r\n\r\npersonally  too, have written several  letters  of\r\n\r\ncomplaint  to the Head of the Fisheries Department\r\n\r\nabout   this,  but  we  have  failed  to   get   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory   reply.   Although   the   Fisheries\r\n\r\nDepartment, in conjunction with the Marine Police,\r\n\r\nhave  mounted more than ten raids but only a  very\r\n\r\nfew of them were arrested. Even among the very few\r\n\r\nwho  were arrested, one of them managed to  escape\r\n\r\nunder the very eyes of the Fisheries officers  and\r\n\r\nthe  Marine Police. This happened on the night  of\r\n\r\n25th  June,  1972, when two illegal trawlers  were\r\n\r\narrested and while they were being towed  back  to\r\n\r\nthe depot, one of them escaped.

As a result,  they  are\r\n\r\nnow  being  threatened by the  illegal  operators.\r\n\r\nSir, I wish to draw the attention of the House  to\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that whenever the Fisheries  Department\r\n\r\nconducts  a  raid of this nature on  a  particular\r\n\r\nnight, the illegal trawlers would stay away. I  am\r\n\r\nvery suspicious of this and perhaps there has been\r\n\r\na  leakage  of information. This is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\ngreat  importance,  and I hope the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nlook  into  this  matter  with  urgency.  If  such\r\n\r\nillegal  operations are not stopped, I  am  afraid\r\n\r\nthat the inshore fishermen might take the law into\r\n\r\ntheir  own  hands,  as they have  lost  faith  and\r\n\r\nconfidence  in the Fisheries Department.  In  that\r\n\r\nevent  I  want  to  make it  very  clear  that  my\r\n\r\nCitizens' Consultative Committee and I myself will\r\n\r\nnot  be  responsible for any eventual consequences\r\n\r\nthat  may  happen, and at any moment now,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhope  I  will  get a satisfactory reply  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

As  a  result,\r\n\r\nthe  price  of fresh mutton and beef has  gone  up\r\n\r\nenormously.

With regard to\r\n\r\nillegal  trawling,  I fully share  the  sentiments\r\n\r\nexpressed by my good friend, the Member for Changi\r\n\r\nand  I would also like to make a similar complaint\r\n\r\nto  the Minister for Law and National Development.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for  Changi just now  mentioned  that\r\n\r\nthere  has been illegal trawling operations  along\r\n\r\nthe east coast of the Republic, but I think it has\r\n\r\nextended  to the north-east sector too, i.e, into\r\n\r\nthe Straits of Johore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, illegal trawling has caused considerable\r\n\r\nharm  and is threatening the livelihood of a  good\r\n\r\nnumber of inshore fishermen in my constituency.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve   complaints  have  been   made   to   the\r\n\r\nDepartment  concerned. Action, in fact,  has  been\r\n\r\ntaken,  but  somehow these illegal  trawlers  come\r\n\r\nback.  Members  of this House have  just  heard  a\r\n\r\nvivid  illustration  of what may  eventually  take\r\n\r\nplace  if  no stern or proper action is  taken  to\r\n\r\ndeprive  these  illegal trawlers of  trawling  not\r\n\r\nonly in the Straits of Johore but also in the east\r\n\r\ncoast. I am told that these illegal trawlers prowl\r\n\r\nthe  Straits of Johore only in the early hours  of\r\n\r\nthe  morning between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. I must make\r\n\r\nit  clear  that  I  was told  that  the  Fisheries\r\n\r\nDivision of the Primary Production Department  has\r\n\r\nbeen watchful over this matter and that the Marine\r\n\r\nPolice has also come into the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to give an idea of how the illegal trawlers\r\n\r\noperate,  allow  me to say this. These  boats  are\r\n\r\npretty  small, but quite highly powered. They  are\r\n\r\nunlicensed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nboats  and  each is manned generally by  three  or\r\n\r\nfour  young  men. When they are Out trawling,  the\r\n\r\nboats  are completely without lights. That is  why\r\n\r\nin  the  process  of this illegal  trawling,  they\r\n\r\ndamage  the  surface nets and other  fishing  gear\r\n\r\nbelonging  to  the inshore fishermen.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nwhen  such things happen, tempers rise.  And  when\r\n\r\ntempers  rise,  you  can bet  that  violence  will\r\n\r\nresult.  Therefore I echo the plea of  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Changi  that the Fisheries Department  should\r\n\r\ntake   stronger  measures  to  eradicate   illegal\r\n\r\ntrawling.  I  suggest that when the  operators  of\r\n\r\nillegal   trawlers  are  caught,  the   Department\r\n\r\nconcerned should press for stiffer sentences,  not\r\n\r\nonly   to   impose  heavier  fines  but  also   to\r\n\r\nconfiscate  both the boat and fishing  gear.  This\r\n\r\nwill, I hope, deter them. Thus, we would not  only\r\n\r\nprotect  the  livelihood of the inshore  fishermen\r\n\r\nagainst  threats  but  also  prevent  any  serious\r\n\r\nconsequences  from arising, which the  Member  for\r\n\r\nChangi has rightly pointed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point I wish to raise is in regard\r\n\r\nto   the  United  Nations  Development  Programme-sponsored\r\n\r\nFishing Training Centre and the  Fishing\r\n\r\nTraining School Vessel. Members will notice  that,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  a  lot of money has been spent  on  the\r\n\r\nrunning  of this project. The Government  together\r\n\r\nwith the T.JNDP have jointly organised courses  to\r\n\r\nencourage more of our youths to take to the sea. I\r\n\r\nam told that there is good response to the courses\r\n\r\nrun  by  the training centre. But when  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  attended such courses go out to fish, a good\r\n\r\nnumber  of  them simply leave the boats  on  their\r\n\r\nreturn. The main reason may be attributed to their\r\n\r\nhaving  to stay for a long period away from shore,\r\n\r\nand  sea-sickness. In this respect,  after  having\r\n\r\nspent  a  lot of money on training them,  the  net\r\n\r\nresult  is that only a handful really stay behind.\r\n\r\nThis is therefore far from satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also told that a few companies are involved\r\n\r\nin offshore and deep-sea fishing activities. But a\r\n\r\nlarge proportion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  their boats are actually otter trawlers.  Most\r\n\r\nof  these  otter  trawlers are based  in  Kangkar,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  part of my constituency. I am happy  to\r\n\r\nsay   that   the   complaints  about   piracy   in\r\n\r\ninternational   waters,   especially   near    the\r\n\r\nHorsburgh   Lighthouse,  have  somewhat   reduced.\r\n\r\nThanks  to the relevant Government department  for\r\n\r\ntheir prompt action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all this, I wonder what the Minister\r\n\r\nhas in mind to overcome all the problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Members  for  Changi and  Punggol  have  both\r\n\r\nraised  the problem of illegal trawling operations\r\n\r\nin  the  east coast and the Straits of  Johore.  I\r\n\r\nwould  now like to tell the Minister that  similar\r\n\r\nactivities are going on in the west coast, namely,\r\n\r\nJurong.  The  Members for Changi and Punggol  have\r\n\r\nalready   given  a  detailed  account   of   these\r\n\r\noperations  and the harm they have caused  to  our\r\n\r\ninshore  fishermen.  When these  illegal  trawlers\r\n\r\noperate  along the coast, they destroy  or  damage\r\n\r\nthe   nets   and  fishing  gear  of  our   inshore\r\n\r\nfishermen.   And   when  this   happens,   certain\r\n\r\nconsequences will result. That is why the  inshore\r\n\r\nfishermen  hate  these illegal trawler  operators.\r\n\r\nHence,  I  urge  the Minister to  adopt  stringent\r\n\r\nmeasures  to stop such illegal trawling operations\r\n\r\nalong our coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like to bring up\r\n\r\nhas  already  been  mentioned by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang.   Although   the   Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  has  done a lot for our  farmers,  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the farmers has not improved.  There\r\n\r\nare various reasons for this. For example, the pig-rearers\r\n\r\nin our country have been leading  a  very\r\n\r\nmiserable  life. Last year, there  was  a  drastic\r\n\r\ndrop in the price of pigs, and they lost a lot. At\r\n\r\nthe   beginning  of  this  year,  there   was   an\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  the price of pigs.  However,  the\r\n\r\nprices  of  animal feed have gone up.  Thus  their\r\n\r\ngains have been set off. The prices of animal feed\r\n\r\nhave gone up because of the increase in the prices\r\n\r\nof   raw  materials  in  the  supplier  countries.\r\n\r\nHowever, the price at source has come down but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  prices of animal feed have not come  down.  I\r\n\r\nwould like the Minister to investigate this matter\r\n\r\nand help our pig farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Anson touched on the\r\n\r\nfoot  and  mouth disease of animals. This  disease\r\n\r\nhas posed a grave threat to our livestock farmers.\r\n\r\nAs a result the Malaysian Government has imposed a\r\n\r\nban  on  imports of our poultry to Malaysia,  thus\r\n\r\ncausing hardship to our poultry farmers. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether our Government can help the  farmers\r\n\r\nto  petition the Malaysian Government to lift  the\r\n\r\nban.  According  to  the  experts,  this  kind  of\r\n\r\ndisease will not spread to poultry and I therefore\r\n\r\nhope  that  our  Minister will  help  our  poultry\r\n\r\nfarmers in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, starting with the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang.  He  complains  about  the  banning  of\r\n\r\norchids   being  grown  around  the   experimental\r\n\r\nstation. I find this hard to believe. One does not\r\n\r\nneed   permission  from  the  Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  grow  orchids  in  Sembawang,   or\r\n\r\nTanglin,  either  in  your  house  or  even  on  a\r\n\r\ncommercial scale. But if you want to grow  orchids\r\n\r\non  a  commercial scale, then it must be  on  land\r\n\r\nproperly  zoned \"agricultural\". So it is not  true\r\n\r\nthat  the  Primary Production Department does  not\r\n\r\nallow  people  to  grow  orchids.  In  fact,   the\r\n\r\nDepartment  has  been encouraging  the  commercial\r\n\r\ngrowth of orchids in the Republic because it is  a\r\n\r\nvaluable foreign exchange earner. Figures for  the\r\n\r\nlast  three years show a steady increase in  total\r\n\r\nvalue. 1970, $1.2 million; 1971, $1.8 million; and\r\n\r\n1972, $2.6 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the price of feed-meal, about which two\r\n\r\nMembers   complained,  unfortunately   we   cannot\r\n\r\nproduce  feed-meal  for pigs in Singapore  without\r\n\r\nimporting  the necessary raw materials.  The  rise\r\n\r\nand  fall  in  prices of feed-meal is  subject  to\r\n\r\nworld  competitive  prices.  As  we  get  our  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials for animal feed-meal from abroad, we are\r\n\r\nsubject  to world prices, depending on demand  and\r\n\r\nsupply. At present, the prices have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngone up and, unless we subsidize the price of  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials for feed-meal, there is nothing  we  can\r\n\r\ndo except to pay what foreign sellers demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang wants the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department to  grow  vegetables  on  a\r\n\r\nlarge  scale.  Several Members  want  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction to chase illegal trawlers.  But  it  is\r\n\r\nrefreshing to hear the Member for Jurong say  that\r\n\r\nthe  Primary Production Department has done a  lot\r\n\r\nfor the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for trawlers, the Member for Punggol has\r\n\r\npointed  out,  it  is  difficult  to  catch  these\r\n\r\nillegal trawlers. The Department together with the\r\n\r\nMarine Police, have done their best. Some trawlers\r\n\r\nhave  been  caught, and some have  escaped.  Early\r\n\r\nthis  year,  the  Member for Changi  informed  the\r\n\r\nDepartment that there was a resurgence of  illegal\r\n\r\ntrawling activities. The Department, together with\r\n\r\nthe  Marine Police and the District Office  (Rural\r\n\r\nEast),  immediately carried out a number of raids.\r\n\r\nIn  the  month of February alone, a  total  of  12\r\n\r\nraids  were conducted between the hours of 8  p.m.\r\n\r\nand 4 a.m. However, no trawlers were sighted. I do\r\n\r\nnot  know what the answer is. Perhaps there  is  a\r\n\r\nleakage  of  information, either  in  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department, or the District Office,  or\r\n\r\nthe  Marine Police, I do not know. But if you have\r\n\r\nevidence of leakage, your proper course is to make\r\n\r\na  report  to  the Corrupt Practices Investigation\r\n\r\nBureau.  To  press for heavier fines or penalties,\r\n\r\nthis  would  really depend on what  the  Judge  or\r\n\r\nMagistrate  will  impose.  But  perhaps   we   can\r\n\r\nconsider revising existing legislation to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  heavier penalties against offenders. But  let\r\n\r\nme  assure all three Members who complained,  that\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  Jurong, Changi  or  Punggol,  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production Department would  welcome  any\r\n\r\ninformation  and advice as to the effective  means\r\n\r\nto  catch  and deal with offenders. I  agree  with\r\n\r\nthem  entirely  that illegal trawling  around  our\r\n\r\nshores  will lead to considerable damage not  only\r\n\r\nto  the fishermen's gear, net, or whatever it  is,\r\n\r\nbut also to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na shortage of fish. There would not be fish around\r\n\r\nour waters unless we stop illegal trawling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Anson, I find it difficult\r\n\r\nto  follow  him.  He  talks of  \"unnecessary  mass\r\n\r\nslaughter\"  with  respect to the  foot  and  mouth\r\n\r\ndisease.  Let  me assure him that  the  slaughter,\r\n\r\nhowever  unfortunate, was very necessary in  order\r\n\r\nto confine the disease within the precincts of the\r\n\r\nquarantine   station.  The   disease   was   first\r\n\r\ndiscovered amongst cattle. As a result,  400  head\r\n\r\nof  cattle  had  to  be destroyed,  some  with  no\r\n\r\nsymptoms  of foot and mouth disease. At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  there  were  4,000  head  of  sheep  in  the\r\n\r\nquarantine   station,  completely  free   of   the\r\n\r\ndisease.  But  soon  after  the  cattle  had  been\r\n\r\ndestroyed,  the  disease spread  to  some  of  the\r\n\r\nsheep. We had no alternative but to slaughter  all\r\n\r\n4,000  head  of  sheep.  However  regrettable  and\r\n\r\nunpleasant  the action might be, it  was  for  the\r\n\r\nsafety of the other animals in Singapore that  can\r\n\r\nbe  infected by this disease. But to say that some\r\n\r\nof this diseased meat got out and was consumed,  I\r\n\r\nhope   not  in  Anson,  is  bordering  on  rumour-mongering.\r\n\r\nLet me assure the Member that  no  such\r\n\r\nmeat  left  the station. No animal, in  fact,  was\r\n\r\nallowed  to leave the quarantine station,  whether\r\n\r\nit was dog, cat, horse, cattle or sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be perhaps interested to know the\r\n\r\npresent  position.  So  far  we  have  managed  to\r\n\r\nconfine  and  eradicate this  disease  within  the\r\n\r\nstation.  There  is no evidence  or  sign  of  the\r\n\r\ndisease   having   spread  beyond   the   station.\r\n\r\nContinued  vigilance  is being  exercised  by  the\r\n\r\nstaff  of  the Primary Production Department.  All\r\n\r\ndogs    and    cats   which   were    quarantined,\r\n\r\nunfortunately longer than necessary as a result of\r\n\r\nthe  outbreak,  were  all  released  on  the  26th\r\n\r\nFebruary, last month. It is intended to leave  the\r\n\r\nquarantine station as it now is, that is  to  say,\r\n\r\nno  animal will be allowed into the station or out\r\n\r\nof  the  station,  for about  another  month  more\r\n\r\nbefore operations can go back to normal. But  even\r\n\r\nwhen operations resume, it will begin with only  a\r\n\r\nfew animals. We do not want another 4,000 sheep\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing  in  and  suffer  another  outbreak  of  the\r\n\r\ndisease, causing all of them to be slaughtered. So\r\n\r\na  test  period with few animals will have  to  be\r\n\r\nundergone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong rightly complains about\r\n\r\nthe  ban  of poultry, as a result of the foot  and\r\n\r\nmouth  disease in Singapore. But foreign bans  are\r\n\r\nnot within our control. Poultry is not affected by\r\n\r\nfoot  and  mouth disease, nor are eggs. But  if  a\r\n\r\nforeign country decides to ban the import  of  our\r\n\r\npoultry or eggs as a result of our foot and  mouth\r\n\r\ndisease,  there  is nothing we  can  do  about  it\r\n\r\nexcept to appeal to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi wanted particulars of the\r\n\r\nFishing  Training Centre. The Member has  not  got\r\n\r\nall  his  facts right. The UNDP-sponsored  Fishing\r\n\r\nTraining Centre runs two courses. One is the  deck\r\n\r\ncourse,  which is to train navigators and  fishing\r\n\r\ntechnicians,  and the other is the engine  course,\r\n\r\nwhich   is  to  train  fishing  vessel  and  shore\r\n\r\nengineers. So far two batches comprising  a  total\r\n\r\nnumber  of  60  trainees have graduated  from  the\r\n\r\ncentre.  Our  records show that out of  the  first\r\n\r\nbatch  of trainees, about 50 per cent are employed\r\n\r\non fishing and other vessels, whilst the remaining\r\n\r\n50  per cent are employed in shipyards and related\r\n\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these one-year courses, the\r\n\r\nCentre also conducts short-term courses from  time\r\n\r\nto time. So far, a total of four courses of two to\r\n\r\nthree  months'  duration have been  conducted  for\r\n\r\ninshore  fishermen who wish to switch to off-shore\r\n\r\nand  deep-sea fishing. A one-week course has  been\r\n\r\nconducted  for  captains of fishing  trawlers.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  Centre also serves  as  the  focal\r\n\r\npoint for dissemination of technical knowledge  to\r\n\r\nfishermen  and fishing companies. The Member  must\r\n\r\nrealise  that deep-sea fishing means a hard  life,\r\n\r\nand  not everyone is prepared to go out for  weeks\r\n\r\nor  months  and  then return to Singapore  and  to\r\n\r\ntheir family thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for flatted factories, I have not forgotten\r\n\r\nthe remarks I made in this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  last  year.  But my  Ministry  has  made  a\r\n\r\nrecommendation to the Ministry of Finance for  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of flatted factories. It has  gone  to\r\n\r\nand fro, between National Development and Finance,\r\n\r\nand  we have not got their approval as yet. It  is\r\n\r\nnot my practice to come here and put the blame  on\r\n\r\nanother  Ministry.  But as I have  to  answer  the\r\n\r\nMember, all I can say is that National Development\r\n\r\nhas  not  slipped on this proposal. We  have  made\r\n\r\nrecommendations to Finance who are considering the\r\n\r\nmatter.  It  is again a question of priority,  and\r\n\r\nhow  much  money they can afford to put aside  for\r\n\r\nthis project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  the Minister to listen carefully to  what  I\r\n\r\nhave to say. He said that it is not necessary  for\r\n\r\nanyone  to get a permit to plant orchids. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  tell him that the place in  question  is\r\n\r\nsomewhere near the Sembawang experimental station.\r\n\r\nThis  land  on  which the farmers intend  to  grow\r\n\r\norchids is leased to them on TOLs. When they  want\r\n\r\nto  grow  orchids on this TOL land, which is  also\r\n\r\nsome sort of agricultural land, they were told  to\r\n\r\napply  to the Primary Production Department for  a\r\n\r\nlicence to grow orchids. When they wanted  to  put\r\n\r\nup  a  fence, they were also told to apply  for  a\r\n\r\nlicence.    When    they   made   the    necessary\r\n\r\napplications, they were informed that the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department might not be likely to  give\r\n\r\nthem  a licence as the experimental station has  a\r\n\r\nbig  scheme in mind. So the farmers complained  to\r\n\r\nme, and I went to see the authorities concerned on\r\n\r\ntheir  behalf.  I  informed them  that  since  the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department had no immediate use\r\n\r\nof the land then they could perhaps grant them the\r\n\r\nlicence  and  later  withdraw it  after  they  had\r\n\r\nactually  implemented the scheme. So  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister was not informed of this, and that is why\r\n\r\nhe  does not know about the matter. Actually it is\r\n\r\nnot   necessary   for   the   Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment to issue any licence at all. If  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  case  that anybody who wants to grow  orchids\r\n\r\ncould go ahead with it, then it is very good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about the growing of\r\n\r\nvegetables  which  I have just  referred  to.  The\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production Department has done a  lot  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  vegetable farming and  I  praise  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  for its efforts. Perhaps the  Minister\r\n\r\ndid  not listen carefully to what I have said. The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Jurong has also praised  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department for what  it  has  done  in\r\n\r\nrespect of vegetable farming. I mentioned this  in\r\n\r\nthe hope that the Ministry concerned can encourage\r\n\r\nmore farmers to go into vegetable farming in order\r\n\r\nto  reduce  the  price  of vegetables,  because  I\r\n\r\nmyself buy vegetables often. But the Minister does\r\n\r\nnot  buy vegetables himself, and therefore he  may\r\n\r\nnot know that the price of vegetables has gone up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am really\r\n\r\nsurprised the Minister said just now that he would\r\n\r\nconsider   amending  the  legislation  to   impose\r\n\r\nheavier  penalties, jail sentences or confiscation\r\n\r\nof  the vessel. However, I remember the hon. Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  stated in a function at the Tanah  Merah\r\n\r\nBesar  Community Centre on the 26th of June, 1971,\r\n\r\nthat   illegal  activities  must  be  stopped   by\r\n\r\nimposition  of heavier penalties and even  jailing\r\n\r\nthe  operators, if necessary. This speech was made\r\n\r\ntwo  years  ago, but since then nothing  has  been\r\n\r\ndone. The Prime Minister's statement has not  been\r\n\r\ntaken heed of. This is very much regretted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether the Minister could assure\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Members for Punggol and Jurong  that  a\r\n\r\nspecial  highly secret operation will  be  carried\r\n\r\nout  against these illegal operators.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  just now, I am very suspicious over the fact\r\n\r\nthat  whenever  a raid is to be carried  out,  the\r\n\r\nillegal  trawler is never around. Sir, I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will listen to the pleas of all the three\r\n\r\nMembers here, myself included, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, there is a little\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding between the Member for  Sembawang\r\n\r\nand  me.  He agrees with me that there is no  need\r\n\r\nfor  a  permit.  But in this particular  case,  he\r\n\r\nspeaks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  a  Temporary Occupation Licence,  which  means\r\n\r\nthat  the land belongs to the State. The land  may\r\n\r\nhave  been let out on licence not for the  growing\r\n\r\nof  orchids, so that if he wants to grow  orchids,\r\n\r\nhe  seeks  the permission of the Land  Office  who\r\n\r\nrefers  him  to the Primary Production Department.\r\n\r\nAnd  in this case, the Department recommended that\r\n\r\nthe licence to grow orchids on the land should not\r\n\r\nbe  granted  because Sembawang  Station  wants  to\r\n\r\nenlarge. That is the reason. It has got nothing to\r\n\r\ndo with permits generally for orchids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wants the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  grow vegetables.  They  are  doing\r\n\r\ntheir  best  not  to  grow vegetables  themselves,\r\n\r\nbecause  if they do then they would be accused  of\r\n\r\ncompeting unfairly with the poor farmers. What the\r\n\r\nDepartment  has,  in  fact, done  is  to  go  into\r\n\r\nhydroponics and mushroom cultivation.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nsubject  on  which some amendments will  be  moved\r\n\r\nlater. The Department has successfully grown fresh\r\n\r\nmushrooms,  and  if this can be  cultivated  on  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  scale,  it is good  for  Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nwould invite the Member for Sembawang to buy  some\r\n\r\nof  these mushrooms at about $3 or $4 a kati.

As I understand\r\n\r\nit, the present port facilities are not sufficient\r\n\r\nfor  us  because there are several ships anchoring\r\n\r\nalongside  the  wharf, and it is not  possible  to\r\n\r\ncram them. This has caused some difficulty in  the\r\n\r\nloading   and   unloading  of  fish.   Since   our\r\n\r\npopulation is increasing, more fish is needed  for\r\n\r\nlocal  consumption. I, therefore, feel that  there\r\n\r\nis  an urgent need to expand the facilities at the\r\n\r\nfishing port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is also a need to set up a\r\n\r\npermanent office at the Central Fish Market. I had\r\n\r\ntouched on this question during the Budget  debate\r\n\r\nlast  year. When I brought up this matter at  that\r\n\r\ntime, the Minister replied that he would recommend\r\n\r\nto  the  Jurong  Town  Corporation  to  set  up  a\r\n\r\npermanent  office there for the use  of  the  fish\r\n\r\nmerchants. He can refer to Hansard, Vol. 31,  col.\r\n\r\n1205,  dated  22nd March, 1972. I would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  inform us of the progress,  if  any,\r\n\r\nwhich has been made in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the question of management of the\r\n\r\nCentral  Fish  Market. Recently  I  have  received\r\n\r\nseveral  complaints  that many  petty  thefts  are\r\n\r\ntaking  place at the fish market. Sometimes  whole\r\n\r\ncrates of fish and prawns are stolen. I know  that\r\n\r\nthere  are about 3,000 people going in and out  of\r\n\r\nthe  fish market every night. There might be  some\r\n\r\nbad  hats among the crowd, and they impose certain\r\n\r\ndifficulties   in   respect  of   management   and\r\n\r\nsecurity. Therefore, there can be no excuse at all\r\n\r\nfor  relaxation in management and control  of  the\r\n\r\nfish  market. Perhaps when we issue entry  passes,\r\n\r\nwe  should  scrutinise  the  applicants  carefully\r\n\r\nbefore issuing them with passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt  the same time the authorities concerned should\r\n\r\nalso  maintain  close  liaison  with  the  Police.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  it  might be useful if the  Police  could\r\n\r\nsend  some officers there during auction  time  in\r\n\r\norder to reduce the incidence of thefts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, judging from the\r\n\r\nMember's remarks, the fishing port and fish market\r\n\r\nin  Jurong have been successful, and that  is  why\r\n\r\nmore space is required. First, the Member will  be\r\n\r\nglad  to know that a sum of $195,000 will be spent\r\n\r\non   extension  work.  The  work  started  on  8th\r\n\r\nFebruary and the completion date is around  August\r\n\r\nthis   year.  The  extension  work  involves   the\r\n\r\nconstruction of three more bays, each 70  feet  by\r\n\r\n120  feet, at the auction area of the Fish Auction\r\n\r\nMarket.  Secondly,  there is provision  of  proper\r\n\r\naccommodation  for  six ice-crusher  stalls  which\r\n\r\nwill replace the present temporary stalls sited at\r\n\r\nthe end of the existing market. There will also be\r\n\r\nthe  installation  of a salt water  pump  to  pump\r\n\r\nwater  from  the sea to facilitate more  efficient\r\n\r\ncleaning of the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the request of more space for the\r\n\r\nretailers,  I am still pursuing that  matter  with\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Finance. I agree with the  Member\r\n\r\nthat more space should be provided, as some of the\r\n\r\nfishmongers are renting space from the  authorised\r\n\r\ntenants and paying rather exorbitant rents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for stealing at the market, there are several\r\n\r\nofficers  on  duty there. At the  peak  auctioning\r\n\r\nperiod  there are about 3,000 people  mingling  in\r\n\r\nthe   market.  This  is  bound  to  lead  to  some\r\n\r\nsquabbles  and  arguments between wholesalers  and\r\n\r\nretailers.  After all it is a fish  market.  There\r\n\r\nhave  been  a  few cases of theft of fish  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket.  The gates of the port are manned  by  two\r\n\r\nsecurity  guards. These guards are retired  Police\r\n\r\nofficers,  and  their duties are to check  persons\r\n\r\nentering  the  fishing port. However,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid, there are about 3,000 people each night,  in\r\n\r\naddition  to about 500 vehicles. It is  impossible\r\n\r\nto check each and every person entering the market\r\n\r\nwithout\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncausing a long queue and much inconvenience to the\r\n\r\nfish  retailers who go to the market to buy  fish.\r\n\r\nHowever,  spot checks are made from time to  time.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Jurong can rest assured  that  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  concerned will look into  his  further\r\n\r\nsuggestion and try to improve the running  of  the\r\n\r\nport and the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister seems to have omitted  the  point  I\r\n\r\nraised  about  the permanent office  in  the  fish\r\n\r\nmarket.

The position is  as\r\n\r\nfollows. At the moment there are temporary offices\r\n\r\nmade of wooden planks for the fish merchants. They\r\n\r\nare  not satisfied with such facilities. Each unit\r\n\r\nis  very  small, and it is very hot  in  the  day.\r\n\r\nAfter  four years certain planks of the wall  have\r\n\r\nbeen  attacked by white ants. They have  therefore\r\n\r\nrequested  whether the Jurong Town Corporation  or\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of National Development can  provide\r\n\r\nthem with more permanent offices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> There is some misunderstanding on\r\n\r\nthis  matter.

In fact, a number\r\n\r\nof  commercial companies engaged in the  catching,\r\n\r\nauctioning and processing of fish have constructed\r\n\r\ntheir own offices in the Jurong fish port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI heard the same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanswer  last  year.

There is no doubt  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  done much in  looking  after  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of the rural people. For many  years  now\r\n\r\nthe  Government has allocated large sums of  money\r\n\r\nfor   the  development  of  the  rural  areas   by\r\n\r\nproviding  facilities  such  as  street  lighting,\r\n\r\nwater  and  electricity supplies and  so  on.  All\r\n\r\nthese facilities have led to improving the lot  of\r\n\r\nthe  people in the rural areas. However, this does\r\n\r\nnot  mean that all the problems pertaining to  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas  have  been solved.  There  is  still\r\n\r\nplenty of room for improvement. In view of this, I\r\n\r\nfeel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the provision of $3.2 million for this  year\r\n\r\nis obviously not enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past years large sums of money have\r\n\r\nbeen  allocated for the improvement of  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  For instance, every year the provision  of\r\n\r\n$100,000 to $120,000 was allotted to Sembawang for\r\n\r\nthe  extension of public facilities. But this year\r\n\r\nthere  is  a reduction in the provision,  the  sum\r\n\r\nvoted  being only about $20,000. What  can  we  do\r\n\r\nwith  this meagre sum of money? In order that  the\r\n\r\nvarious   construction  works  in  the   Sembawang\r\n\r\nconstituency  can be carried out successfully,  we\r\n\r\nshould  increase this provision. I  remember  that\r\n\r\nduring  the  Budget debate last  year,  I  made  a\r\n\r\nrequest that, for the financial year 1973-74,  the\r\n\r\nprovision for the rural areas should be increased.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister told me then that he would take note\r\n\r\nof  my  request. However, after one year it  seems\r\n\r\nthat  he  has  forgotten about  this  matter.  The\r\n\r\nprovision for this subhead is actually the same as\r\n\r\nthat  for  the last financial year.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nincrease.   The   sum  is  still  $3.25   million.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I will continue to request the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Law and National Development to appeal to the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance to pay more attention to  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the rural people and allot more money\r\n\r\nnext year for the various development projects  in\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas  so that the  rural  people  can\r\n\r\nachieve  the same rate of progress and  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nsame  standard  of living as those  in  the  urban\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the vote for the rural areas has not\r\n\r\nbeen  increased, the provision should be  utilised\r\n\r\nto   get  the  maximum  benefit.  We  should  also\r\n\r\nencourage the rural people and national servicemen\r\n\r\nto  do voluntary work or gotong royong the various\r\n\r\nGovernment projects so as to reduce expenditure. I\r\n\r\nwill  avail myself of this opportunity and mention\r\n\r\na  gotong  royong project that took place  on  the\r\n\r\n10th of March and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwhich  was  carried out successfully. Two  hundred\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen  from the  Seletar  and  Ayer\r\n\r\nRajah  Barracks toot part. Hundreds  of  villagers\r\n\r\nfrom  Sembawang  also responded to this  voluntary\r\n\r\nroad  project. According to the PWD,  the  project\r\n\r\nwas scheduled to be completed in four days. But it\r\n\r\nwas  completed  two days ahead of  schedule,  thus\r\n\r\nsaving a lot of expenditure for the Government.  I\r\n\r\nwould  also  avail myself of this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\npraise  the good performance put up by the 200-odd\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen  from  the  Ayer  Rajah   and\r\n\r\nSeletar  Barracks. I must also thank the villagers\r\n\r\nand  the  people  from the community  centres  for\r\n\r\ntheir  help in this project. They have  put  up  a\r\n\r\ngood  performance. They have saved Government some\r\n\r\nmoney  and  also contributed a great deal  towards\r\n\r\nthe  good relationship between the ordinary  folks\r\n\r\nand  the  soldiers. Therefore, we  must  encourage\r\n\r\nthis kind of co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to say that the distribution of\r\n\r\nthe   vote  for  the  various  projects   is   not\r\n\r\nappropriate. For instance, the provision  for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of agricultural and kampung roads  is\r\n\r\nonly  $750,000. This is insufficient. One  of  the\r\n\r\nproblems   facing   the   rural   areas   is   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  roads  and  usually  the  amount\r\n\r\nprovided is inadequate. The vote for the extension\r\n\r\nof  water  supply  is $1.5 million.  Though  water\r\n\r\nsupply  is very important, I feel that in  certain\r\n\r\nareas,  more roads should be constructed. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  the  Minister to pay attention to  this.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is  any  surplus  from  the  vote  for  the\r\n\r\nextension of water supply, I hope it will be  used\r\n\r\nfor the building of more roads in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind hon.

However, to the disappointment of  Members\r\n\r\nfrom the rural constituencies, the amount provided\r\n\r\nfor  road construction for 1973-74 is the same  as\r\n\r\nthat  for  1972-73, i.e, only $750,000. When  this\r\n\r\nmeagre sum is divided and allocated to the various\r\n\r\nrural constituencies, each rural constituency will\r\n\r\nget not more than $60,000. This sum is usually not\r\n\r\nenough  to metal one agricultural road, let  alone\r\n\r\nsetting  aside  a certain amount  for  repairs  of\r\n\r\nexisting roads. Although the rural areas have been\r\n\r\nshrinking    due    to    industrialisation    and\r\n\r\nurbanisation,  there are still  many  rural  areas\r\n\r\nwhere roads, drainage systems and social amenities\r\n\r\nhave  to  be provided. The rural folks  want  good\r\n\r\nroads.  No  road is considered good if it  is  not\r\n\r\nmetalled.  A  laterite road or even a quarry-waste\r\n\r\nroad  will not resist wear and tear caused by  the\r\n\r\nweather.  Therefore,  it is  subjected  to  damage\r\n\r\nevery  other year. Sometimes the amount  spent  on\r\n\r\nrepairs is quite sizable. If we add up the  repair\r\n\r\ncosts of a road over a period of 10 years, the sum\r\n\r\nmight  well  be enough to metal a road.  Since  we\r\n\r\nhave a surplus in our budget, I fail to understand\r\n\r\nwhy  the Government cannot set aside a bigger  sum\r\n\r\nof  money  to metal all the rural roads. When  all\r\n\r\nthe  roads are metalled, the Government only  need\r\n\r\nto  spend a small sum for the maintenance  of  the\r\n\r\nroads, such as the patching up of pot-holes. So in\r\n\r\nthe  long  run, it is more economical to  metal  a\r\n\r\nroad than to repair it every now and then. I would\r\n\r\ntherefore urge the Parliamentary Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development, who is also the\r\n\r\nChairman   of   the  Urban  and   Rural   Services\r\n\r\nCommittee, to seriously take note of my suggestion\r\n\r\nand recommend a bigger sum for the construction of\r\n\r\nroads for 1974-75.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to suggest to the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  that  the  various projects  should  be\r\n\r\nadequately supervised. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise, through lack of supervision  and\r\n\r\nthe  poor quality of work of the contractors,  the\r\n\r\nproject  is  ruined as soon as it is completed.  I\r\n\r\nhave invited the Parliamentary Secretary to make a\r\n\r\nsite  visit to Jurong to see for himself the  poor\r\n\r\nquality  of work of the contractors. I am thankful\r\n\r\nto  him for accepting this invitation. He has seen\r\n\r\nfor  himself  the  standard of work  done  by  the\r\n\r\ncontractors.   Sir,   to   repair   the   damages,\r\n\r\nadditional  expenditure has to be  incurred.  This\r\n\r\nis,  therefore,  tantamount to a waste  of  public\r\n\r\nfunds.  I  would urge the Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nconcerned to look into this matter seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should not\r\n\r\ntake  more than two minutes.

Over the past few years, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has done something for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe rural areas. Although the performance has been\r\n\r\nquite satisfactory in itself, on the whole, it  is\r\n\r\nnot adequate enough when compared to the high rate\r\n\r\nof  progress  and development in the urban  areas.\r\n\r\nThe  feeling  is  that the rural areas  are  still\r\n\r\nbackward.  But if we compare the present  rate  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the rural areas with that of a  few\r\n\r\nyears ago, it could be excusable, because at  that\r\n\r\ntime  our economy was such that we came to a stage\r\n\r\nwhen the spirit was willing but the body was weak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has said that with the\r\n\r\nbuoyant  economy and with a surplus budget,  there\r\n\r\nare  favourable conditions for the  Government  to\r\n\r\nallocate  more  sums of money for the  improvement\r\n\r\nand  progress of the rural areas, particularly  in\r\n\r\nregard to the metalling of roads, the construction\r\n\r\nof  drains  and  the  provision  of  other  social\r\n\r\namenities so as to make it possible for the  rural\r\n\r\npeople to enjoy the modern facilities in life.  It\r\n\r\nis   therefore   regrettable  to  see   that   the\r\n\r\nallocation  for 1973-74 is the same  as  that  for\r\n\r\n1972-73.  As was pointed out by the other Members,\r\n\r\nit  is  also  my hope that a bigger  sum  will  be\r\n\r\nprovided  for  1974-75.  Even  if  the  amount  is\r\n\r\ndoubled it may not be enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Lee. May I remind Members\r\n\r\nagain that this means less time for the Minister\r\n\r\nto answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  various  rural MPs who have  spoken  on  this\r\n\r\namendment  have requested for more funds  for  the\r\n\r\nrural   areas.  This  is  a  matter  of   urgency.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  our past experience,  the  sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney  allotted for the construction of  roads  in\r\n\r\nthe rural areas were not adequate. In fact, I feel\r\n\r\nthat  if  we  had  really  understood  the  actual\r\n\r\nconditions in rural areas, we would conclude  that\r\n\r\nthere  had been a wastage of funds. First of  all,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  vote was insufficient, metalling  of\r\n\r\nthe road had to be done in stages. And if the work\r\n\r\nwas phased out over a matter of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\none or two months it would not be too bad; but the\r\n\r\nphasing was done over two to three years. So, if a\r\n\r\nroad  was  metalled in three phases  over  a  long\r\n\r\nperiod  of  time, then a lot of money  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  wasted. When the first part of the road  was\r\n\r\nmetalled,  people were quite happy about  it,  but\r\n\r\nthe  second  and  other parts  of  the  road  were\r\n\r\ndifficult  to pass. When the second  part  of  the\r\n\r\nroad  was metalled, the first part began  to  show\r\n\r\nsigns  of  damage and in need of repair.  When  it\r\n\r\ncame to metalling the third part of the road,  the\r\n\r\nfirst  part  of the road would have  gone  into  a\r\n\r\nstate  of  disrepair.  This is  a  very  difficult\r\n\r\nsituation. Unless the situation is remedied, a lot\r\n\r\nof  money would be wasted. We should allocate more\r\n\r\nfunds to metal the full stretch of the road all at\r\n\r\nthe  same time. We must think of the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  rural  people.  You can speak  to  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople,  and they will tell you that although  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has spent a lot of money to develop the\r\n\r\nroads in the rural areas, the actual situation  is\r\n\r\nsuch  that throughout the whole year or throughout\r\n\r\ntheir  whole  life, they will not be able  to  set\r\n\r\nfoot  on  a completely metalled road, and  at  the\r\n\r\nvery best, the road has been partly metalled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pointing out all these matters with the\r\n\r\nmain  aim  of supporting the appeals of the  rural\r\n\r\nMPs,  that  is, for more funds next year  for  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas.  The Government must  consider  this\r\n\r\nappeal  very seriously and in all earnestness.  In\r\n\r\nthat  way, we will not let down the rural  people.\r\n\r\nInstead  we  will be able to give  them  a  better\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I thank Members for their\r\n\r\nsupport. Somehow I feel that their remarks  should\r\n\r\nhave  been addressed to a different Ministry.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development, like the Members\r\n\r\nthemselves,  feels  that  more  money  should   be\r\n\r\nallocated  for  projects of  the  URSC.  Even  the\r\n\r\nChairman  of the URSC would be happier if  he  had\r\n\r\nmuch  more  money  to divide between  the  various\r\n\r\nconstituencies and the various\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprojects. Whether it is for water, electrification\r\n\r\nor  roads,  we  have to divide this sum  of  $3.25\r\n\r\nmillion  amongst the various projects. If they  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  that the amount of $750,000 is  enough\r\n\r\nfor  rural  roads, let me assure them that  though\r\n\r\nthese  divisions are made for the different items,\r\n\r\nmoney  allocated for, say, water, if unspent,  can\r\n\r\nbe  used  for roads. And if one constituency  does\r\n\r\nnot use its funds, as Tanglin last year, the funds\r\n\r\nare  re-allocated  to another  constituency.  This\r\n\r\ngoes  round.  Sometimes  we  spend  more  in   one\r\n\r\nconstituency than what has been allocated  to  it,\r\n\r\nand  in  some  constituencies we spend  less.  The\r\n\r\ndivision is a fair one between the constituencies.\r\n\r\nWe   divide  into  rural,  sub-rural,   urban   or\r\n\r\nsuburban. Their ratio of 1: 3 : 5 is multiplied by\r\n\r\npopulation and area. Hence the allocation. As  far\r\n\r\nas  is  possible,  the rural areas  get  the  most\r\n\r\nmoney.

Memebers of the House have pointed\r\n\r\nout that in some places where pedestrain overhad bridges and \r\n\r\nunderpasses. Sir, I would like to point out to Members of this \r\n\r\nHouse that whilst Government apportions public \r\n\r\nfunds for the construction of overhaead pedestrain bridges. \r\n\r\nThis could mean that pedestrians, instead of making use of \r\n\r\nsuch bridges, simply dash across the roads.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I can best illustrate my point by citing the example\r\n\r\nof the overhead pedestrian bridge built near the unction of \r\n\r\nTampines Road and Upper Serangoon Road, where there is a \r\n\r\ntraffic light. There are several schools in the area, and I \r\n\r\nnotice that, in the evenings oand sometimes in the mornings, \r\n\r\nvery few students only seem to want to make use of the \r\n\r\noverhead crossing. The others will simply dash across to the \r\n\r\nmiddle of the road, stop short at the divider, and continue \r\n\r\nwith their hazardous way of crossing the road. Sir, in spite \r\n\r\nof the safety-first \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncampaigns having been mounted on a number of occasions, and for \r\n\r\nwhich our Minister of State for Education had the privilege to \r\n\r\nopen, it still does not drive home the importanat point that \r\n\r\nGovernment constructs these overhead bridges and underpasses for \r\n\r\nthe pedestrains to corss roads safely. Perhaps primary and \r\n\r\nsecondary schools should be told to encourage their students to \r\n\r\nmake use of such pedestrain crossings, because during peak hours \r\n\r\ntraffic is very heavy and it is a danger to their safety if they \r\n\r\ndo not make use of such crossing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether the Minister will look into the\r\n\r\npossiblility fo condstructiong some shops along these \r\n\r\nunderpasses so that it will attarct pedestrains to make use of \r\n\r\nthem. I have been to  countries overseas where they have shops \r\n\r\nalong subways and underpasses. I see that  a lot of \r\n\r\npedestrains when they wlak along these subways and \r\n\r\nunderpasses, do look around. It will not be a dull moment. In \r\n\r\nthe case of Singaproe, whilst it may be ture that some PWD \r\n\r\nengineers may say: \"look, in Singapore the ground is a it soft \r\n\r\nand water-logged\", I think Members will agree that there is a \r\n\r\nproblem to be looked into. If we are to build unerpasses, it \r\n\r\nis up to the engineers and planners to think of ways and means \r\n\r\nto overcome such problems and ot merely taking the easy way \r\n\r\nout by saying, \"All right, we build an overhead bridge. \r\n\r\nWhether or not the public makes use of it is not our concern. \r\n\r\nIf they still want to run across the road instead of using the \r\n\r\noverhead crossing ro underpass, that is their fault.\" No, Sir, \r\n\r\nfar from it. Because a lot of money has been spent on it, this \r\n\r\nmatter has been brought up several times in this House.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Sir, there has been talk about introducing\r\n\r\nlegislation against jaywalking. Id do nto think that that is a \r\n\r\nwise move, because I personally believe in relentless \r\n\r\npersuaion, especially in our schools, because our adult \r\n\r\npopulation may not pick up that habit easily, as can be seen \r\n\r\nat bus stops where instead of lining up they would \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclamber to get into the bus. This habit has got to be inculcated \r\n\r\nin the young. I hope the Minister concerned will give it every \r\n\r\nconsideraton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, let me first assure the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol that the Ministry of National Development is not \r\n\r\nlooking for an easy way out. At the request of many MPs, \r\n\r\noverhead bridges have been built. Having built the bridges, \r\n\r\nif pedestrains refue to use them, my Ministry cannot do \r\n\r\nanything except to pass legislation, which the hon. Member \r\n\r\nconsiders undesirable.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the constructin of underpasses, this is very expensive\r\n\r\nand can be justified only in very special circumstances, e.g. \r\n\r\nunder Anderson Bridge leading to Queen Elizabeth Walk. Even if \r\n\r\nfunds are available, the feasibility of building and underpass \r\n\r\nwill depend on the location and a number of technincal \r\n\r\nfactors. Beyong that, Sir, I have nothing further to add, \r\n\r\nexcept that in my view it is desirable to build more overhead \r\n\r\nbridges. In fact, we intend to do so because some of out raods \r\n\r\nare becoming impasable to pedestrains. For example, if you \r\n\r\nwant to cross Bukit Timah Road or Dunearn Roads, you only hope \r\n\r\nis the pedestrain bridge. And there are many schoools along \r\n\r\nboth roads which require overhead bridges. If overhead bridges \r\n\r\nare used, then the number of accidents along roads over which \r\n\r\nthese bridges are built will be cut down.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> sir, if overhead bridges are used, I see the\r\n\r\njustification in expendign public funds. But I would like to \r\n\r\nclarify the disagreement of the Minister when I say that maybe \r\n\r\nhis PWD engineers looked for the easy way out. The easy way \r\n\r\nout simply means this. If there is a request for an overhead \r\n\r\npedestrain crossing, then some period of time must be given to \r\n\r\nevaluate as to the need to put up the overhead crossing. That \r\n\r\nis to say, when such a crossing is put up, pedestrains will \r\n\r\ndefinitely make use of them. But if pedestrians do not make \r\n\r\nuse of them,\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  is nothing more anyone can do about it.  \r\n\r\nHowever,  I  quite agree with what else  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMinister has said just now, and I do not  wish  to\r\n\r\nprolong the argument.

Would the Minister  be  kind\r\n\r\nenough  to  inform the House as  to  who  will  be\r\n\r\nconducting the study, and how long will it take?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the object of the Central Area\r\n\r\nExpressway is to relieve traffic congestion and to\r\n\r\nmake the Central Area more easily accessible,  the\r\n\r\nconsequence  may  quite possibly adversely  affect\r\n\r\nthe  urban  environment and the  economic  use  of\r\n\r\nspace.  With the implementation of this Expressway\r\n\r\nand improvement of other existing roads, more cars\r\n\r\nwould  be  attracted  and expected  to  enter  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Area.  Unless,  of course,  supplementary\r\n\r\npolicies     and    measures    are     introduced\r\n\r\nsimultaneously to effectively control the  vehicle\r\n\r\npopulation in the Central Area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the Minister would also be kind\r\n\r\nenough to inform the House whether steps have been\r\n\r\nor will be taken soon to formulate policies and to\r\n\r\nintroduce  measures to discourage and control  the\r\n\r\nuse of private cars in certain congested parts  of\r\n\r\nour city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, may I first thank the Member for\r\n\r\nhis  suggestions. He has expressed some fears over\r\n\r\nwhich  my Ministry is genuinely concerned. As  for\r\n\r\nthe  Feasibility and Engineering Study for Central\r\n\r\nArea Expressway, this study will be conducted by a\r\n\r\nconsulting firm, or consortium firms, specialising\r\n\r\nin  traffic  engineering, planning or  engineering\r\n\r\neconomics. The study will be in two phases.  Phase\r\n\r\nI  involves the updating of traffic projections to\r\n\r\n1982  and 1992, preparation of economic evaluation\r\n\r\nof   the  expressway  system,  recommendation   of\r\n\r\nalignments and interchange layouts, and comparison\r\n\r\nof  alternative  schemes. This  phase  would  take\r\n\r\nabout  seven  months  to  complete.  Phase  II  is\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  detailed designs,  specifications\r\n\r\nand  estimates,  and  will  take  a  further  nine\r\n\r\nmonths.   The  P.W.D, will  offer  a  counterpart\r\n\r\npersonnel in this phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with or without the proposed expressway,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  more cars on the  road  with  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  our national economy. The Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  has taken steps to increase the taxes  on\r\n\r\ncars,  but I doubt whether this will prevent  more\r\n\r\ncars  being bought and driven on our roads  unless\r\n\r\nthe   tax  is  further  raised.  But  I   am   not\r\n\r\nencouraging him to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that we have to do something about\r\n\r\nour  transport and parking problems.  The  parking\r\n\r\npolicy  will,  in  fact,  be  reviewed  when   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Mass Rapid  Transit  Study,\r\n\r\nnow   being   conducted   by   the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nCommunications,  are  finalised.   Some   of   the\r\n\r\nfindings  of this Study will be used as  data  for\r\n\r\nthe proposed Central Area Expressway Project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other suggestion that cars or even\r\n\r\nvehicles should not be allowed into certain  parts\r\n\r\nof  the  city, we had tried a pilot scheme to  ask\r\n\r\nowners of cars to park in Kallang.

If  50,000 or 70,000 people  go  to  the\r\n\r\nNational  Stadium  for the  opening  of  the  SEAP\r\n\r\nGames, it is obvious that everyone cannot drive up\r\n\r\nthere.  It  is also pretty obvious that the  motor\r\n\r\ncars or buses in which they travel will have to be\r\n\r\nparked  not  immediately next to the  Stadium  but\r\n\r\nperhaps a little further away, in Beach Road or in\r\n\r\nthe   old  People's  Association  ground.  It   is\r\n\r\nphysically impossible for everyone to drive up  in\r\n\r\ngrand  fashion and alight at the entrance  to  the\r\n\r\nNational Stadium at Kallang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I would like to thank\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for his very fine explanation.
