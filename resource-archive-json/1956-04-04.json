He\r\n\r\nwas never satisfied, Sir, unless everything was done\r\n\r\nproperly and efficiently, and, as you have said,  he\r\n\r\nhad  a detailed knowledge of Parliamentary procedure\r\n\r\nwhich was of great benefit to everyone of us in this\r\n\r\nHouse and in the previous Legislative Council; and he\r\n\r\nhad,  what is more, Sir, an intense loyalty to  the\r\n\r\nprinciples   and   traditions;   of   Parliamentary\r\n\r\ngovernment.

He  was  always  respectful   and   yet\r\n\r\ndignified, but he was insistent on anything he  held\r\n\r\nto  be  right; and both this Assembly, Sir, and  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Legislative Councils owe him a great  debt\r\n\r\nof  gratitude for his knowledge and his wisdom,  and\r\n\r\nwe shall sorely miss his guidance in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully share the regrets that have been expressed\r\n\r\nthat  his  keen  sense  of  responsibility  and  his\r\n\r\nrefusal  to  spare himself in the  service  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  have overtaxed his health so that  he  now\r\n\r\nhas  to give up this work to which he was so devoted\r\n\r\nand  in  which he so excelled.

The police  had  been\r\n\r\napprehensive  before  the rally  that  any  incident\r\n\r\nmight set off serious disorders. The collapse of the\r\n\r\nplatform  before  the speeches started  disorganised\r\n\r\nthe   arrangements  and  disrupted  the  loudspeaker\r\n\r\nsystem,   and  the  rally  then  divided  into   two\r\n\r\ngroups - one group round the platform and one group in\r\n\r\nfront  of the terminal building. Around the platform\r\n\r\nthere was a state of disorder. There were shouts  to\r\n\r\nbeat  up  the police on duty and some of  the  crowd\r\n\r\nbegan  to  pick up missiles to throw at the  police.\r\n\r\nPolitical  leaders there tried to quieten the  crowd\r\n\r\nand  songs, such as \"Unity is strength\", were  sung.\r\n\r\nAfter  about  half  an  hour  the  crowd  round  the\r\n\r\nplatform moved over to the terminal building to hear\r\n\r\nthe  speeches,  but owing to the  breakdown  of  the\r\n\r\nloudspeakers, they could not do so. At four  minutes\r\n\r\npast  six the Parliamentary delegation and  most  of\r\n\r\nthe  political leaders left. A large section of  the\r\n\r\ncrowd did not realise that the meeting was over  and\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  shout and make a lot of noise.  About\r\n\r\nthis  time  it began to rain and most of  the  crowd\r\n\r\nstarted  to  move  off;  but about  3,000  remained,\r\n\r\nsinging and shouting. There was also some dancing. A\r\n\r\nsection  of this crowd sought shelter from the  rain\r\n\r\nin  the  terminal  building,  breaking  through  the\r\n\r\ndoors.  As  they  were  disorderly  and  were  doing\r\n\r\ndamage,  the  police ejected them from the  building\r\n\r\nand a police cordon was posted outside the building.\r\n\r\nThe;  singing  and dancing continued and  it  became\r\n\r\nclear that this crowd of about 3,000 was excited and\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  and  demanding to hear  their  leaders\r\n\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police on duty were jeered and taunted by\r\n\r\nyouths  in  the crowd and three spaces were  cleared\r\n\r\nfor dancing. At about 6.40 p.m. the chanting became\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  excited  and  a  number of  youths  were  seen\r\n\r\nworking up their companions, lobbing pieces of wood,\r\n\r\npoles  and banners at the police who remained steady\r\n\r\nat  their  posts. Suddenly a section of  this  crowd\r\n\r\npicked  up  stones from a heap of rubble  and  threw\r\n\r\nthem  at the police and at the building. The stone-throwers  were mainly youths and the  stoning  was\r\n\r\nstarted  by  a  small group whose  numbers  quickly\r\n\r\nincreased  to  about 300 or more.  The  police  then\r\n\r\nmoved forward with batons, using their raincoats as\r\n\r\nshields against the stones, and for about 15 minutes\r\n\r\nthe  crowd  alternately fell back before the  police\r\n\r\nand  advanced  again throwing stones, until  finally\r\n\r\nthey were dispersed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group of several hundred attacked the\r\n\r\npolice  field  post and the St. John Ambulance  post\r\n\r\nwith bottles and stones. They also were dispersed by\r\n\r\nthe police and the whole area was finally cleared at\r\n\r\nfive minutes past seven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 police officers suffered minor injuries and 15\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public were treated for  injuries,\r\n\r\nall  of  them minor except one, who was admitted  to\r\n\r\nthe  hospital with cut in the head. One police  van,\r\n\r\nsome police radio equipment and a St. John ambulance\r\n\r\nwere damaged and most of the windows in the terminal\r\n\r\nbuilding  were  smashed.  Eight  persons  have  been\r\n\r\narrested and charged with rioting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police had been apprehensive of disorder\r\n\r\nbecause  of slighting references made to the police\r\n\r\nat  several  P.A.P. meetings  and  because  of  the\r\n\r\ncampaign  in the Press by a large group of so-called\r\n\r\nChinese  cultural associations and students  during\r\n\r\nthe  previous  two weeks protesting against  police\r\n\r\nrefusals  to issue licences for the performance  of\r\n\r\nsongs and dances of Communist  meaning. These\r\n\r\norganisations held a further protest meeting at  the\r\n\r\nBadminton Hall immediately prior to the mass  rally.\r\n\r\nAfter  it,  at  about 4 p.m., some  4,000  to  5,000\r\n\r\nyouths  from that meeting marched in an orderly  and\r\n\r\ndisciplined  manner to the rally.   They  carried  a\r\n\r\nlarge  banner depicting the Communist dove of peace.\r\n\r\nWhen  they  encountered police officers  on  duty,\r\n\r\nthere was organised shouting of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMerdeka.

A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill, Sir, is fully explained\r\n\r\nin  the  Explanatory  Note attached,  and  there  is\r\n\r\nlittle I think I need add.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill does two things. It requires the\r\n\r\nregistration  of  the name of the child  within  one\r\n\r\nyear  from the date of its birth and gives a  period\r\n\r\nof  one  year in which the name of the child can  be\r\n\r\nchanged,  as  I understand not infrequently  happens\r\n\r\nhere.  As  the  law  now stands,  the  name  can  be\r\n\r\nregistered on payment of a fee for a period of seven\r\n\r\nyears from the date of birth. This has caused a good\r\n\r\ndeal  of  trouble over the admission of children  to\r\n\r\nschools.   When  parents  come  to  register   their\r\n\r\nchildren,  they  find  that  the  birth  certificate\r\n\r\neither has not got a name on it, or it has the wrong\r\n\r\nname  on  it,  and  they then  have  to  go  to  the\r\n\r\ninconvenience   and  expense  of  making   statutory\r\n\r\ndeclarations  to get the uncertainty put  right.  On\r\n\r\ngeneral  grounds as well, it is desirable  that  the\r\n\r\nname  of  the child should be registered as soon  as\r\n\r\npossible after the child has been born. So the  Bill\r\n\r\nrequires  that  the name shall be registered  within\r\n\r\none  year.  Provision  is,  however,  made  for  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar-General in special cases to allow the name\r\n\r\nto be registered up to seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second main provision of this Bill is that it\r\n\r\nends  the temporary provision which was made in 1946\r\n\r\nextending the period for registration to make up for\r\n\r\nthe  loss  of time during the period of the Japanese\r\n\r\noccupation.  That temporary provision is  no  longer\r\n\r\nrequired  and  will  be  ended  when  this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nenacted. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The Commission found that  the\r\n\r\nexisting system of licensing procedures followed was\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory, and in this respect they recommended\r\n\r\nthat  there  should be a single Licensing  Authority\r\n\r\nfor  the whole island and that this Authority should\r\n\r\nnot  consist  of an elected body of members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic;  and  they  further  recommended  that,   in\r\n\r\nsetting  up  such a Licensing Authority, due  regard\r\n\r\nmust  be  given  to  the  special  position  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Traction  Company  under  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction Ordinance. This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill  accepts  these recommendations  and  seeks  to\r\n\r\nimplement them. It sets up a single Authority and  a\r\n\r\ncommon system following very closely section 326  of\r\n\r\nthe Municipal Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it may be helpful at this stage if I\r\n\r\ncomment  on  certain clauses in the Bill.  Clause  3\r\n\r\nprovides that the Authority shall consist of  public\r\n\r\nservants.  It is intended at present that we  should\r\n\r\nhave  three  public  servants as  an  immediate  and\r\n\r\nessential   step   to  obtain  a  single   Licensing\r\n\r\nAuthority.  Later  it  would be  desirable  that  we\r\n\r\nshould have an expert - probably a single expert - who,\r\n\r\nafter  becoming a public servant, would be appointed\r\n\r\nas  the Licensing Authority. That would be following\r\n\r\nparagraph 134 (v) of the Hawkins Report, but for the\r\n\r\ntime  being  we are following paragraph 245  of  the\r\n\r\nreport for the interim stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may be interested to know the particular\r\n\r\nofficers  we  have in mind for the  Authority.  They\r\n\r\nwould  be  the  President of the City  Council,  the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the  Rural Board,  and  the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the  Ministry of  Communications  and\r\n\r\nWorks. This would provide that the interests of  the\r\n\r\nurban  and  rural areas were adequately  represented\r\n\r\nand  that  the Ministry concerned with the operation\r\n\r\nof the Ordinance was also represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I should refer perhaps to one\r\n\r\namendment  I  have to move. It was found  after  the\r\n\r\nBill  had been printed that, in fact, the definition\r\n\r\nof \"public servant\" would be held not to include the\r\n\r\nPresident  of  the City Council. It seems  a  highly\r\n\r\nlegal  point to me, but in any case we have  cleared\r\n\r\nit up by an amendment which will make it quite clear\r\n\r\nthat he is a public servant for the purposes of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the general directions in clause 4, certain\r\n\r\nrecommendations are made in the Hawkins Report as to\r\n\r\nwhat,  for  the  interim  period,  would  be  proper\r\n\r\ndirections. These are found in paragraph 246 of  the\r\n\r\nreport.  These  recommendations would  be  that  the\r\n\r\nLicensing  Authority  should  not,  at  this  stage,\r\n\r\nattempt to achieve any major reorganisation  of  the\r\n\r\nroutes and that it should,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  time  being,  confine  itself  to  new  or\r\n\r\nextended  routes  where at present no  services  are\r\n\r\nprovided. Further, that for the time being, licences\r\n\r\nshould  be limited to six months, as they have  been\r\n\r\nin  the  past.  If  later we have  a  single  expert\r\n\r\nserving  as  the  Authority, it will  no  doubt  be\r\n\r\nappropriate  that  we should cancel  or  modify  the\r\n\r\ndirections given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 (2) follows section 326 of the Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  and  the point about not  exceeding  one\r\n\r\nyear  might be queried by hon. Members who will have\r\n\r\nnoted in the report that it is suggested that if  we\r\n\r\nwere to maintain a system of separate ownership  for\r\n\r\nthe  different bus companies, a period of a year for\r\n\r\nthe  licence is insufficient and they should have  a\r\n\r\nlonger  period so that they would have some security\r\n\r\nand encouragement to invest fresh capital. I am glad\r\n\r\nto  report, however, that although this Bill and the\r\n\r\nHawkins Report have been before the public, there is\r\n\r\nno  sign whatever of any absence of applications  by\r\n\r\nthe  bus  companies to extend their routes.  On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary, the particular urgency of this Bill arises\r\n\r\nfrom  the  fact  that  such an  enormous  number  of\r\n\r\napplications  are pending and should  not  be  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  under  the old system. It is the view  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  in  agreement  with  the  report,  that\r\n\r\nseparate  ownerships cannot, as things are,  produce\r\n\r\nan efficient transport system which really meets the\r\n\r\nneeds of the travelling public, and consequently  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  take  any action  which  is  likely  to\r\n\r\nperpetuate that system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proviso to clause 5 (2) may possibly raise a\r\n\r\nquery  somewhere, and I might deal  with  that  now.\r\n\r\nThis proviso is necessary because of sections 32 and\r\n\r\n63  of  the Singapore Traction Ordinance. I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink   I  need  quote  those  rather  lengthy   and\r\n\r\ncomplicated  sections, but if anybody wants  to,  he\r\n\r\ncan  go into them. But, briefly, where the Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction Company is referred to in this Bill,  both\r\n\r\nin  the proviso to clause 5 (2) and elsewhere, it is\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  necessary that we should  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  they  have a charter and they have to  operate\r\n\r\nunder  it as long as they have not been taken  over.\r\n\r\nIt would be highly contrary to public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npolicy  to  deprive them of the charter  which  they\r\n\r\nhave been given by law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be moving one or two other minor\r\n\r\namendments,  Mr  Speaker, in  the  course  of  this\r\n\r\ndebate. They are not of any great significance. They\r\n\r\nare  minor consequential and drafting changes.

Will he please wait until\r\n\r\nwe have reached the Committee stage?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, previously\r\n\r\nthe  licensing authority for omnibuses  was  in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  the  City Council and the  Rural  Board.\r\n\r\nDuring  that  period we have many bus routes  coming\r\n\r\ninto  operation, and, according to my  observations,\r\n\r\nwe  find that some of the bus routes are confined to\r\n\r\nthe  city  area whereas others are mainly  in  rural\r\n\r\ndistricts. The difficulty encountered by  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople to come down town is indeed immense. Take the\r\n\r\ncase of a person coming down from the R.A.F. base at\r\n\r\nSeletar to Tanjong Pagar. He will find that  he  has\r\n\r\nto  change  buses twice. Now we hope that all  these\r\n\r\ndifficulties will be overcome by the setting up of a\r\n\r\nsingle  Authority which will take over the functions\r\n\r\nexercised  previously by the City  Council  and  the\r\n\r\nRural Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally believe that any services provided\r\n\r\nshould work for the benefit of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlarge  numbers of people instead of for the  benefit\r\n\r\nof  companies, and I hope that when this Bill  comes\r\n\r\ninto operation, the Licensing Authority will bear in\r\n\r\nmind  this fact - that it is to license buses not  for\r\n\r\nthe  convenience or profit of the companies but  for\r\n\r\nthe convenience of the people using them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be interesting, Sir, to know why the\r\n\r\npowers  vested in the hands of the City Council  and\r\n\r\nthe Rural Board previously should be transferred  to\r\n\r\na  single  Licensing Authority,  and  why  a  larger\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people should not be more preferable  on\r\n\r\nthis board. I will raise this question again when it\r\n\r\ncomes up during the Committee stage and will propose\r\n\r\nan  amendment to this effect. We feel, in fact, that\r\n\r\nit  would  be better to have more people on  such  a\r\n\r\nboard to determine the routes of buses. We feel that\r\n\r\nnot  only should the people at the top of the public\r\n\r\nservice be given a voice to determine the routes  of\r\n\r\nbuses,  because  they have good judgment,  but  also\r\n\r\npeople  who know the rural folks or town  folks  who\r\n\r\nare  using the buses should also be given  a  voice.\r\n\r\nThey  are the people who are going to use the buses.\r\n\r\nThey are the people who know the difficulties or the\r\n\r\ninconvenience encountered, and not people  who  ride\r\n\r\nto  and  from their offices in cars. This should  be\r\n\r\nborne  in mind, and that is why I feel that to  have\r\n\r\nthree persons to serve as the Licensing Authority is\r\n\r\nnot enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, today we are coming to a stage where\r\n\r\nwe  are  asking  for equality for all.  We  are  not\r\n\r\nfighting  for  any one section of the public.  If  a\r\n\r\ncertain  law is applicable to A, it must be  equally\r\n\r\napplicable  to  B and to C and to other  people.  We\r\n\r\nfind  that,  because  of the  old  system,  we  have\r\n\r\npreferential treatment for one company  and  another\r\n\r\nkind  of treatment for another company. I feel  that\r\n\r\nthat is wrong and that, if this Assembly is fighting\r\n\r\nfor  equality and shouting at the top of  its  voice\r\n\r\nthat it is fighting for equality, then even in small\r\n\r\nmatters we should also fight for equality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have here a company that has been given a\r\n\r\ncharter,  a  company  that  is  taxed  at  a   fixed\r\n\r\npercentage.  This company will be able to  go  ahead\r\n\r\nwith  expansion  feeling very secure  that  it  will\r\n\r\nrecoup its capital. If this company has trouble with\r\n\r\nits  workers, or if its buses get out of  order,  it\r\n\r\nneed  not  lose money on that account. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  other bus companies have to take  out  a\r\n\r\nlicence for each of their buses; and whether the bus\r\n\r\nruns  for 30 days in a month or one day in a  month,\r\n\r\nthe  companies  have still to pay the  same  licence\r\n\r\nfees. If there is a strike, which may or may not  be\r\n\r\ntheir   fault,  they  may  lose,  because  the   bus\r\n\r\ncompanies  will  still have to  pay  their  fees.  I\r\n\r\ncertainly feel, Sir, that in an instance like  this,\r\n\r\nif   we   cannot  remove  the  special  preferential\r\n\r\ntreatment  given  to  one  company,  it  should   be\r\n\r\npossible  for  us to move the other  way  round  and\r\n\r\nallow   the  other  bus  companies  to  enjoy  equal\r\n\r\nadvantages. Is that not equality? Is that  not  what\r\n\r\nwe  are fighting for? When that charter or when that\r\n\r\npreferential   treatment   has   been   removed   by\r\n\r\nnationalisation,  then let us subject  all  the  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies to the same level of taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, licensing as envisaged in this Bill on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of  half  a year  or  one  year  is  not\r\n\r\nconducive to the expansion of the bus companies,  if\r\n\r\nI  am  to invest some money in a project, I must  be\r\n\r\nreasonably sure that it will help me to go on  until\r\n\r\nat least my bus is out of order or condemned; but if\r\n\r\nI have to buy a new bus at great cost and after half\r\n\r\na  year  find  that the licence has been  suspended,\r\n\r\nthen I may not want to put in as much money into the\r\n\r\nbusiness as I would like to. I ask you, Sir, when  a\r\n\r\nsituation like this develops, who suffers? It is not\r\n\r\nthe Government, but it is the people who will not be\r\n\r\nprovided with such facilities. It is the people  who\r\n\r\nlive far away in rural areas who will not be able to\r\n\r\nget their buses as frequently as they should get.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  such  a matter should be looked  into  very\r\n\r\ncarefully and the period of licensing extended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is\r\n\r\nnot  a  great deal I wish to say on this Bill except\r\n\r\nthis.  I assume that, as the Government has accepted\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations of the Transport Commission  in\r\n\r\nso  far  as  it  has agreed to set  up  a  Licensing\r\n\r\nAuthority  at  the  transition stage,  it  has  also\r\n\r\naccepted  the  recommendation  to  nationalise   the\r\n\r\ntransport system in accordance with the Labour Front\r\n\r\nplatform.  That  being  so,  I  consider  that   the\r\n\r\nMinister  should tell us more clearly what the  next\r\n\r\nsteps are which the Government proposes to take.  It\r\n\r\nis   unreasonable  to  keep  the  bus  companies  in\r\n\r\nsuspense  in  this matter. It means  that  they  are\r\n\r\nunable  or unwilling to plan improvements  in  their\r\n\r\nservices,   and  this  means  that  the  unfortunate\r\n\r\ntravelling  public will suffer. This House  and  the\r\n\r\ntravelling  public have a right  to  know  what  the\r\n\r\nprecise  intentions  of  Government  are.  Will  the\r\n\r\nMinister  tell  us  whether or  not  the  Government\r\n\r\nproposes to carry out its election promises?' On the\r\n\r\nassumption  that  it intends to do so,  we  consider\r\n\r\nthat the next step to take is to appoint as soon  as\r\n\r\npossible  a  transport and traffic expert  who  will\r\n\r\nhave to undertake the task of nationalisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Some interesting points were\r\n\r\nraised, Mr Speaker, in this debate. We had  a  very\r\n\r\nfervent address to open with - that the Authority must\r\n\r\nserve  the people - but it was rather confused.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot think that the hon. Member quite grasped what it\r\n\r\nis all about, but he spoke with great enthusiasm for\r\n\r\nthe  rights  of  the people and I  fully  share  his\r\n\r\nsentiments.  I  have  no  doubt  at  all  that   the\r\n\r\nAuthority  will  serve the people  to  the  greatest\r\n\r\ndegree  that  they  can be served  in  the  existing\r\n\r\ncircumstances where an inefficient past  system  and\r\n\r\nthe   very  naturally  competitive  claims  of   bus\r\n\r\ncompanies have created what is, in fact, a very  bad\r\n\r\nsystem  where  services cannot run  efficiently  and\r\n\r\nwhere the public suffers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member was concerned about equality of\r\n\r\ntreatment   for  the  companies,  and,  of   course,\r\n\r\nequality is a very desirable thing; but I am  afraid\r\n\r\nthat  if  you have a millionaire and you cannot  tax\r\n\r\nhim,  it  is not practical policy that we must  make\r\n\r\neverybody  into millionaires, which is broadly  what\r\n\r\nhe was suggesting. If the Singapore Traction Company\r\n\r\nhas special privileges by charter, the hon. Member's\r\n\r\nsolution  is that we should give all other companies\r\n\r\nequal  privileges  and then proceed  to  nationalise\r\n\r\nthem!  A delightful thought, that having given  them\r\n\r\nextra privileges we then pay them for the privileges\r\n\r\nwe have given them, and thus charge the unhappy tax-payer  a  further large sum of money  for  conceding\r\n\r\nwhat we should not have conceded at all! I am afraid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  this  is not a very wise financial policy  and\r\n\r\none which I certainly could not advocate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also anxious that six months is the\r\n\r\npractice and that a year is the maximum under clause\r\n\r\n5  (2)  for  the grant of a licence, and  that  this\r\n\r\nmight prevent people from putting fresh capital into\r\n\r\nseeking  to  expand new routes. He is  living  in  a\r\n\r\nhappy state of ignorance. If he had referred to  his\r\n\r\nown  Party  Members in the City Council, they  could\r\n\r\nhave  informed him that there are no  less  than  63\r\n\r\napplications  now  outstanding for consideration  by\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council. With this Bill already published\r\n\r\nand  if  he regards 63 applications under the shadow\r\n\r\nof  nationalisation as intimidating the capitalists,\r\n\r\nI  can  assure  him  that they  are  not  so  easily\r\n\r\nintimidated. There is no sign at present of a drying-up  of  the desire of the companies to expand  their\r\n\r\nservices.  Therefore, that particular scare  on  his\r\n\r\npart,  I  can  assure him, is quite unnecessary.  He\r\n\r\nneed   have  no  apprehensions  as  to  the  present\r\n\r\nsituation.  The  companies are only too  anxious  to\r\n\r\nobtain  more routes in order, no doubt, to reap  the\r\n\r\nbenefit in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede asked that we\r\n\r\nshould state our policy. This is a favourite request\r\n\r\nwhich comes up again and again. I can bring out  our\r\n\r\nlittle  green  booklet  which  says  that  we   will\r\n\r\nnationalise  the public passenger transport  system,\r\n\r\nbut  I  think I might usefully say a few words about\r\n\r\npolicy  in general since the Opposition are  anxious\r\n\r\nfor  it.  Nationalisation is our policy and for  the\r\n\r\npurposes of this industry, that means that  we  must\r\n\r\nuse  public ownership to bring industry under public\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suggest that the Minister\r\n\r\nconfine himself to the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Very well, Mr Speaker, I have no\r\n\r\nparticular desire to elaborate on our policy. It can\r\n\r\nbe  dealt with later, but not in this debate. But if\r\n\r\na question is put down, we can certainly provide for\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is nothing else, Mr Speaker, for me\r\n\r\nto  answer in reply except to say that the need  for\r\n\r\nan  expert to deal with the situation is very  fully\r\n\r\nrealised.  Nobody  supposes that  a  body  of  three\r\n\r\npublic  officers  will, by the mere  fact  of  being\r\n\r\nappointed, become immediately traffic experts. All I\r\n\r\ncan  say  is that they will undoubtedly be far  more\r\n\r\nefficient  than  the very large  body  of  popularly\r\n\r\nelected  people  who  have  been  dealing  with  the\r\n\r\nsituation in the past. The point that the larger the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people dealing with traffic  routes  the\r\n\r\nbetter  is  a  fantastic  misunderstanding  of   the\r\n\r\nsituation.  The  damage to the transport  system  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, the whole muddle and confusion  that  now\r\n\r\nexist  have arisen because there has been this large\r\n\r\nnumber of heads all representing people of different\r\n\r\nareas  and  all with confused views. The result  has\r\n\r\nbeen  serious inefficiency in the transport  system,\r\n\r\nbecause  there  has  not  been  a  proper  means  of\r\n\r\nexercising control over the licensing. I do not wish\r\n\r\nto  express  opinions about it, but it is  perfectly\r\n\r\nclear that the transport map of Singapore at present\r\n\r\nis  a mess, and as long as you continue to have  the\r\n\r\npresent  system, you will merely get more  and  more\r\n\r\ninto  a  mess. Very radical steps will be needed  to\r\n\r\nget   the   mess  cleared  up  and  to   provide   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory system for the future, but those  steps\r\n\r\ncannot  be  taken  immediately.  They  have  to   be\r\n\r\nprepared for and provided for. But what we can do is\r\n\r\nto set up a Licensing Authority which will ensure at\r\n\r\nleast   that   the   situation  does   not   further\r\n\r\ndeteriorate  and  that we do  maintain  as  much  of\r\n\r\nreason and wisdom in the allocation of routes as  is\r\n\r\npossible.

I  personally feel that the chaos is  due  to\r\n\r\npeople  who, though they are dealing with licensing,\r\n\r\nknow  nothing about what is best for the  people.  I\r\n\r\nhave heard that the three Government servants to  be\r\n\r\nappointed are the President of the City Council, the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the  Rural Board,  and  the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the  Ministry of  Communications  and\r\n\r\nWorks. They are all fine men, Sir, but I think  that\r\n\r\nthey  all  ride in cars and that whatever news  they\r\n\r\nhave  about the convenience of using buses  is  only\r\n\r\nsecond-hand. They do not have first-hand experience,\r\n\r\nand  I  believe that if we leave licensing  to  such\r\n\r\npeople alone, you might have fair licensing but  you\r\n\r\nwill  not  have efficient licensing.  You  may  have\r\n\r\nservices  to  which bus owners might  agree,  but  I\r\n\r\ndoubt whether these people will come to the question\r\n\r\nof making them convenient for the people using them.\r\n\r\nThese  three public servants must be assisted.  That\r\n\r\nis  the reason why I propose that amendment.

It is one which has previously  been\r\n\r\nconsidered  and  I have, in fact,  had  one  or  two\r\n\r\nletters from members of the public to say that  they\r\n\r\nthought there might be a case for putting members of\r\n\r\nthe public on this Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out the extremely invidious\r\n\r\nand  unpleasant position any such man would have  to\r\n\r\noccupy.  There is considerable money to be made  out\r\n\r\nof  securing a new route, and consequently a  burden\r\n\r\nof coffee-shop talk does attach itself to the people\r\n\r\nwho have the duty of allocating routes. It would  be\r\n\r\nextremely  hard on anybody not a public  servant  to\r\n\r\nhave to bear that weight of contention when he says,\r\n\r\n\"I think we should give this route and we should not\r\n\r\ngive  that.\" He has to make a choice - \"I have to give\r\n\r\nit  to  this company and not to that company.\" These\r\n\r\nare  painful and difficult decisions and  it  is  an\r\n\r\nunnecessary  burden to impose. To find some  men  to\r\n\r\ncarry that burden seems to me to be unnecessary. The\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  envisages that these two men  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  voice the opinions of the public, but,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  the  public have every facility  for  voicing\r\n\r\ntheir  opinions either in this Assembly or elsewhere\r\n\r\nor in the newspapers or by direct representations to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister dealing with transport.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nspecial  advantage  in having their  representations\r\n\r\ndirectly    on    the   Authority   itself.    Their\r\n\r\nrepresentations   can  reach  the  Authority   quite\r\n\r\nsuccessfully. If we put two people on, who will each\r\n\r\nnecessarily  reside in some particular district,  to\r\n\r\nthem  will attach the suspicion that they  are  more\r\n\r\ninterested  in  their  own district  than  in  other\r\n\r\ndistricts.  It  would  expose  them  again  to   the\r\n\r\nquestion   of   doubt.  These  are   the   sort   of\r\n\r\ndisadvantages   which  would  follow   without   any\r\n\r\ncorresponding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadvantages  in  getting, in fact, any better  advice\r\n\r\nthan  is available anyhow, and which would be  fully\r\n\r\ntaken  into  account by the various responsible  and\r\n\r\nsenior  officers who are envisaged for  the  interim\r\n\r\nperiod as the Licensing Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the hon.

This\r\n\r\nHighways  Co-ordination Committee will be  available\r\n\r\nand  will be used for consultative purposes  by  the\r\n\r\nLicensing  Authority  when it is  dealing  with  the\r\n\r\nproblems of specific routes and whether they  should\r\n\r\nbe   granted  or  not.  The  Highways  Co-ordination\r\n\r\nCommittee  includes  the  City  Council,  the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard, the planners of the S.I.T., the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nVehicles'  Office, the Public Works  Department  and\r\n\r\nthe  Police, and thus covers effectively the  wisdom\r\n\r\nof  this  country, such as it is,  in  dealing  with\r\n\r\nmatters  of  transport  and road  communications.

Very\r\n\r\ndetailed  notes have been added to the  Bill.  These\r\n\r\nnotes draw attention to and they explain all changes\r\n\r\nwhich have been made to the present law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and main object of this Bill, Sir, is to\r\n\r\nconsolidate  and bring up to date our  pensions  law\r\n\r\nwhich  is now 27 years old and has been amended  and\r\n\r\nneeds consolidating and revising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second main purpose of this Bill is to provide\r\n\r\none  uniform  scheme of pensions and gratuities  for\r\n\r\nall  members of the public service of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthat  will  do  away with the invidious  distinction\r\n\r\nwhich  previously existed between those  members  of\r\n\r\nthe public service who were on what was known as the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Establishment  and  whose  pensions   and\r\n\r\ngratuities  were governed by the Singapore  Pensions\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  and  the other set of  officers  in  the\r\n\r\npublic service here who used to be on what was known\r\n\r\nas  the Malayan Establishment and were on a separate\r\n\r\nseries of pension regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making this consolidating Bill, we have\r\n\r\nextended  to all officers in the public service  the\r\n\r\npension   factor  of  one  six-hundredth   (1/600th)\r\n\r\ninstead     of    one    seven-hundred-and-twentieth\r\n\r\n(1/720th)-1/600th being the factor which  previously\r\n\r\nwas applied to officers on the Malayan Establishment only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of other comparatively minor changes have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  in  the Bill. They are  improvements  to\r\n\r\nbring the law into line with modern practice and, as\r\n\r\nMembers  will see from the Comparative Table printed\r\n\r\nat  the  very end of the Bill, we have, to  a  great\r\n\r\nextent,  followed the legislation which was  enacted\r\n\r\nin the Federation in 1951. There is one change which\r\n\r\nperhaps  I  should mention at this  stage  which  is\r\n\r\npeculiar to Singapore in the sense that we  are  not\r\n\r\nin  line with the Federation on it; and that is that\r\n\r\nwe have made a change in what is known as the normal\r\n\r\nage for compulsory retirement. That at present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  55  and in this Bill, clause 9 (a) changes  that\r\n\r\nfor officers joining the service after this Bill has\r\n\r\nbeen   enacted  whose  normal  age  for   compulsory\r\n\r\nretirement  will  be 60. We have made  this  change,\r\n\r\nSir,  to  take account of the fact that the  general\r\n\r\nage of the population here has become higher than it\r\n\r\nused  to  be, and with the expansion of  the  public\r\n\r\nservice  we feel that the Government can  no  longer\r\n\r\nafford  to allow officers to retire at an  age  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  still  capable  of  giving  further  good\r\n\r\nservice  to the public. The change, as I have  said,\r\n\r\nwill only be applied to officers joining the service\r\n\r\nafter this Bill comes into force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been under consideration for a long\r\n\r\ntime  and has been discussed in great detail in  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Service Joint Council, and the Staff Side  of\r\n\r\nthat   Council  have  accepted  the  Bill  and   the\r\n\r\nregulations as they are printed, subject only to one\r\n\r\nreservation. That reservation is that the Staff Side\r\n\r\nreserve   the  right  at  a  later  date   to   make\r\n\r\nrepresentations asking for an option to retire to be\r\n\r\ngiven  to officers at 45, whereas now it is 50.  The\r\n\r\nStaff  Side  are not, at the moment,  pressing  that\r\n\r\npoint  but  they wish to be free to raise  it  later\r\n\r\nshould they so decide, and in the meanwhile they  do\r\n\r\nnot wish the enacting of this Bill to be delayed  on\r\n\r\nthat account. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we note the\r\n\r\nstatement of the Hon. the Chief Secretary  that  the\r\n\r\nStaff  Side  of the Civil Service has  accepted  the\r\n\r\nBill   with  the  reservation  that  they  can  make\r\n\r\nrepresentations   as   to  the   optional   age   of\r\n\r\nretirement. I wish to place on record the  point  of\r\n\r\nview of my Party that, with rapid Malayanisation  of\r\n\r\nthe   civil  service,  it  becomes  more  and   more\r\n\r\nimperative  that  experienced local officers  should\r\n\r\nstay in the service for a much longer time than they\r\n\r\nwere previously allowed. But at the same time it may\r\n\r\nbe  in the interest of the country as a whole if the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the Committee  on  the  Age  of\r\n\r\nRetirement, which were published on 19th  September,\r\n\r\n1952, were given careful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration, and enacted in an amendment  to  this\r\n\r\nBill. This Committee's Report at page 7 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"(a)  that  an  officer  be  allowed  to  retire  on\r\n\r\npension,  and  that  the Government  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nrequire him so to retire, when, or after, he reaches\r\n\r\nthe  age of 45, or completes 20 years in the  public\r\n\r\nservice,  whichever is the later; provided  that  at\r\n\r\nthe  age  of  50 it should be possible  for  him  to\r\n\r\nretire  or  be  retired irrespective  of  length  of\r\n\r\nservice;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)\r\n\r\nbelow, the age of 55 shall continue to be the age at\r\n\r\nwhich Government officers will normally retire;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are in agreement with the\r\n\r\nprinciples set out in clause 9 of the Bill that  the\r\n\r\nnormal age of retirement henceforth for officers who\r\n\r\njoin  the service after the passing of this Bill  be\r\n\r\nraised  to  60.  It  may seem inconsistent  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  support the recommendation contained in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee's Report that there should be an  optional\r\n\r\nage  of  retirement for serving officers  of  45  or\r\n\r\nafter 20 years' service, whichever is the later. But\r\n\r\none must consider the problem historically. Sometime\r\n\r\nbefore the war the Government first, I think, in the\r\n\r\n1930's began to recruit local officers in the  civil\r\n\r\nservice. It meant, in effect, that the most capable,\r\n\r\nthe  best  educated  and  those  with  the  greatest\r\n\r\ncapacity  to contribute to the political development\r\n\r\nof this country joined the civil service. By British\r\n\r\ntraditions,  the  civil service is  neutral.  It  is\r\n\r\nthere - the  bureaucratic machinery  that  politicians\r\n\r\ncan  mount  and  operate. But in the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  they  discovered very early on that,  unless\r\n\r\nthis  rule was relaxed, it meant that a large number\r\n\r\nof  capable men would be debarred from giving a much\r\n\r\nbigger  contribution by having a hand in the shaping\r\n\r\nof  the  political future of the country. When  this\r\n\r\nCommittee made this recommendation, I feel that such\r\n\r\nconsiderations must have weighed on its mind. It  is\r\n\r\nan open secret that there are many serving officers,\r\n\r\nboth in the Federation and in Singapore, who are men\r\n\r\nwho   could   contribute  more  to  the   political\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  this  country  than  the  host   of\r\n\r\npoliticians  that  have so far presented  themselves\r\n\r\nbefore the electorate of this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry.  We therefore wish to place on  record  our\r\n\r\nhope  that  in  the  not too distant  future,  after\r\n\r\nfurther  discussions and consultations  between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Staff Side Council, an  amendment\r\n\r\nto  this Bill, when it is passed, will be put before\r\n\r\nthis House incorporating the main recommendations of\r\n\r\nthis Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

They have been translated into the  actual\r\n\r\nconduct of our policy both domestic and foreign.  We\r\n\r\nare  parties  to  the Atlantic Charter,  the  United\r\n\r\nNations  Charter,  the  Potomac  Charter,  and   the\r\n\r\nPacific  Charter. In  them  we  have,  with   other\r\n\r\nfriends,  dedicated ourselves to the goal  of  self-government  and independence of all countries  whose\r\n\r\npeople  desire  and  are capable  of  sustaining  an\r\n\r\nindependent existence. During the past 10  and  more\r\n\r\nyears 600 million men and women in nearly a score of\r\n\r\nlands   have,   with  our  support  and  assistance,\r\n\r\nattained  nationhood. Many millions more  are  being\r\n\r\nhelped  surely  and steadily toward self-government.\r\n\r\nThus, the reality and effectiveness of what we  have\r\n\r\ndone is a proof of our sincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, we know that political independence cannot\r\n\r\nalone  assure  men and nations full  opportunity  to\r\n\r\npursue   happiness  and  to  fulfil  their   highest\r\n\r\ndestiny.  There  is,  likewise,  need  for  economic\r\n\r\nsustenance and growth. This, too, we have helped  to\r\n\r\nprovide.  We  seek to develop with  others  a  large\r\n\r\nvolume of mutually beneficial trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise we seek, through technical assistance,\r\n\r\nthe Colombo Plan and other programmes we support, to\r\n\r\nhelp   economic  progress  in  the  less   developed\r\n\r\ncountries and to raise the living standards of their\r\n\r\npeoples. In these programmes we have not sought  nor\r\n\r\ndesired  extension of either economic  or  political\r\n\r\npower.  The purpose is not to dilute but  to  enrich\r\n\r\nand secure their freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While resolutely pursuing these aims, which are\r\n\r\nthe  products of our faith in God and in the peoples\r\n\r\nof  the  earth, we shall eagerly grasp  any  genuine\r\n\r\nopportunity to free mankind of the pall of fear  and\r\n\r\ninsecurity which now obscures what can and should be\r\n\r\na glorious future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">ANTHONY EDEN.\"</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in these sonorous terms, Sir, that two great\r\n\r\nleaders   of   the  free  world  have  shown   their\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of the cry of subjugated  people  for\r\n\r\nfreedom and have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromised  their unselfish aid and support - moral  and\r\n\r\nmaterial.  In the context of this Declaration,  Sir,\r\n\r\nSingapore's struggle is but part of a world  pattern\r\n\r\naccepted  as  natural,  as  healthy  and   even   as\r\n\r\npraiseworthy. There is therefore no need to  explain\r\n\r\nwhy  we want independence and no need to explain  to\r\n\r\nthese  statesmen why we want freedom, but the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and the President have made it clear  that\r\n\r\ntheir  support and assistance is conditional on  two\r\n\r\nfactors.  The  first is that the  people  desire  an\r\n\r\nindependent existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prior to Merdeka Week, I freely admit that I\r\n\r\nwas  genuinely alarmed at assertions  made  in  very\r\n\r\nresponsible  quarters that the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwanted to pursue their normal vocations and were not\r\n\r\ninterested in political advance and that the call of\r\n\r\nMerdeka   came   from   a   strident   minority   of\r\n\r\nintellectuals.  It seemed to me, Sir,  that  such  a\r\n\r\nview  could  have  very dangerous repercussions  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It then seemed to me that it  was  vital\r\n\r\nthat  we should impress upon all observers who could\r\n\r\ninfluence the Colonial Office of the truth, and this\r\n\r\nhad to be done before the 23rd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen in other parts of the world and we\r\n\r\nsee today the tragic cost of wisdom after the event.\r\n\r\nWe wanted none of this wisdom after the event and  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  say for myself, Sir,  I  am  deeply\r\n\r\ngrateful  to all Parties in this House, and  to  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the Press, for recognising the peril and\r\n\r\nawakening  the people of Singapore to  the  dangers.\r\n\r\nDespite   a   sectional  campaign  of  vilification,\r\n\r\ndistortion and sometimes plain filth, the deep swell\r\n\r\nof  the  people's wish came through the  smokescreen\r\n\r\nclearly and firmly and I am glad to say that I  have\r\n\r\nnot  since heard any single responsible person  deny\r\n\r\nthat  the  great majority of the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nactively  desire an end to colonial rule. Sir,  that\r\n\r\nfirst  condition  of the Washington Declaration  can\r\n\r\ntherefore be taken to be admittedly satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second condition is that the people are\r\n\r\ncapable  of sustaining an independent existence.  In\r\n\r\nthe Colonial Office, this is transformed into that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfamous   three-word  question  before  which   every\r\n\r\ncolonial delegation trembles. The question is,  \"Are\r\n\r\nyou  viable?\"  That  means  merely,  Sir,  \"Are  you\r\n\r\ncapable   of  surviving  economically  without   any\r\n\r\nspecial  external  economic  assistance?\"  and   the\r\n\r\nanswer  for  Singapore is \"Definitely, yes!\"  It  is\r\n\r\ntrue,  Sir, we receive assistance, for which we  are\r\n\r\ngrateful, from the Colonial Development and  Welfare\r\n\r\nFund.  We  receive some assistance from the  Colombo\r\n\r\nPlan. They are helpful but they are not essential to\r\n\r\nour  economy. We go to London, Sir, to seek the gift\r\n\r\nof  our  freedom. We go to seek no  gift  of  money,\r\n\r\neither in subsidy or in interest free loan or  under\r\n\r\nany  other  name  whatsoever. Singapore  financially\r\n\r\nundertakes  to  stand on its own  feet.  The  second\r\n\r\ncondition of the Washington Declaration, signed  but\r\n\r\ntwo  months ago by the Prime Minister of the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  is  therefore fulfilled  and  we  can  now\r\n\r\ntruthfully  say  to  the United Kingdom  Government,\r\n\r\n\"Singapore is a ripe opportunity for the exercise of\r\n\r\nthose noble, humanitarian principles embodied in the\r\n\r\nWashington Declaration. Help us to our feet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) says,\r\n\r\n\"What  is this freedom?\" It is independence we seek.\r\n\r\nThat  is  absolute.  It is independence  within  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Commonwealth, and that is no  qualification\r\n\r\nof  the absolute as the Prime Minister of India  has\r\n\r\nso clearly demonstrated. Why do we want to be within\r\n\r\nthe  Commonwealth? Sir, the Commonwealth is a United\r\n\r\nNations  within the United Nations - a  more  flexible\r\n\r\ninstrument  for  co-operation because  there  is  no\r\n\r\nconstitution;  a  more efficient instrument  because\r\n\r\nthe  close  day-to-day relations of  the  individual\r\n\r\nmembers make for a practical partnership. The  over-emphasis  on  European  interests  is  progressively\r\n\r\ndisappearing and the concept of the Commonwealth  is\r\n\r\nemerging  as the most powerful instrument for  peace\r\n\r\nand  freedom in the world of today. Furthermore, let\r\n\r\nus remember, we who survive by virtue of our trading\r\n\r\nactivities, that our trade is appreciably within the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore is prepared to contribute in full  measure\r\n\r\nto  the  defence  requirements of the  Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  welcome an  equal  opportunity  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the Commonwealth's policies Singapore,\r\n\r\nSir,  would be proud to be a partner with the  other\r\n\r\nindependent States within this association known  as\r\n\r\nthe Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having reached this formula, Sir, of independence\r\n\r\nwithin the Commonwealth as the framework of our  own\r\n\r\ndesires,  we  must  look at the vital  interests  of\r\n\r\nother territories in this area. We do recognise that\r\n\r\nSingapore is a very important fort in the  defence\r\n\r\nstrategy of the Commonwealth and its allied  nations\r\n\r\nof   the  free  world.  This  is  known,  and  quite\r\n\r\nerroneously, as the problem of the external  defence\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. I say quite erroneously, Sir, because\r\n\r\nit  has  nothing whatever to do with the defence  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as such. The primary factor is the defence\r\n\r\nof  the  other members of the Commonwealth  and  the\r\n\r\nallied nations from Singapore and not the defence of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Now, Sir, having clarified this  concept\r\n\r\nof external defence, the question does arise: should\r\n\r\nSingapore concede to the Commonwealth the  right  to\r\n\r\nuse  this  island as a fort? We are realists - I  hope\r\n\r\nall of us - and, as realists, we first face the brutal\r\n\r\nfacts  and the outstanding one is that we could  not\r\n\r\nrefuse  it  even  if we wanted to. As  a  reasonable\r\n\r\npeople,  we face realities and accept them. This  is\r\n\r\nthe reality we must face: that Singapore is vital to\r\n\r\nthe  free  world strategy to a point that  makes  it\r\n\r\nunreasonable and impractical to refuse its use as  a\r\n\r\nfort.  In  these  circumstances,  I  understand  all\r\n\r\nParties   are  agreed  that  we  should  allow   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth through the United Kingdom the  fullest\r\n\r\nfacilities for their defence needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to add this for myself, for some\r\n\r\nMembers  on the Government Benches and I  trust  for\r\n\r\nsome  Members on the Opposition Benches.  There  are\r\n\r\nother  reasons both moral and material which support\r\n\r\nthis decision. There are those of us, and of them  I\r\n\r\nam  one,  who believe with all our hearts  that  the\r\n\r\ninstitution of parliamentary democracy is the finest\r\n\r\npolitical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstitution for the full development of the  people.\r\n\r\nWe  believe it is an institution worth fighting and\r\n\r\nworth  dying  for. We believe Singapore should  take\r\n\r\nits place shoulder to shoulder with the other States\r\n\r\nof  the Commonwealth and the free world in any armed\r\n\r\nstruggle  to  defend  the  ideals  of  freedom   and\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy.  We  also   believe   that\r\n\r\nSingapore should shoulder the obligations as well as\r\n\r\nthe  privileges of its unique geographical  position\r\n\r\nand  finally, Sir, it may seem sordid but it  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant point, I would remind Members of the House\r\n\r\nthat  one-sixth of our labour force is  employed  by\r\n\r\nthe  armed forces and the contribution of the  armed\r\n\r\nforces   to   our  economy  is  quite  considerable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, whether we approach this problem  as\r\n\r\npractical  men  only or whether we  approach  it  as\r\n\r\npractical and moral men, the answer is the same.  We\r\n\r\nare  all agreed that concurrently with independence,\r\n\r\nwe  will  give  all  necessary  control  for  United\r\n\r\nKingdom   defence  commitments.  This  agreement   I\r\n\r\nunderstand all Parties are prepared to undertake  to\r\n\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, external defence is to some extent\r\n\r\naffected  by  external  relations  and  by  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity.  In  the realm of external  relations,  we\r\n\r\nseek  for Singapore the right of full relations with\r\n\r\nother   States   both   within   and   without   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth - the  right to appoint  ambassadors  and\r\n\r\nHigh  Commissioners, in fact, the full right  of  an\r\n\r\nindependent territory - and we are agreed  that  where\r\n\r\naction in the realm of external affairs affects  the\r\n\r\nexternal  defence commitments of the United Kingdom,\r\n\r\nwe  shall  act  in consultation with  Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment. Sir, let there be no misunderstanding on\r\n\r\nthat.  In  matters of peace and war,  in  all  major\r\n\r\nmatters    which   affect   the   external   defence\r\n\r\ncommitments of the Commonwealth, we are prepared  to\r\n\r\nagree   to   accept  the  advice  of  Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment and to follow it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question, Sir, which has been actively\r\n\r\noccupying  our  minds  is the question  of  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity and especially two aspects of it. The first\r\n\r\naspect   is:  to  what  extent  the  Government   of\r\n\r\nSingapore which wants inde-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npendence can be said to be able to maintain internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  with its own forces. Now, Sir,  since  the\r\n\r\nwar,  we  have  had a really delightful  arrangement\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation.  By  this  arrangement,   the\r\n\r\nFederation raises all the military forces  necessary\r\n\r\nfor  Malaya's defence purposes and Singapore  raises\r\n\r\nall  the  naval forces necessary for the defence  of\r\n\r\nthe  coast of Malaya. I trust that I need not remind\r\n\r\nMembers   of   this   House  that  Malaya   includes\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Sir,   this  arrangement   has   worked\r\n\r\nexclusively  for the benefit of the Federation.  The\r\n\r\nFederation has a Federation Regiment which is  being\r\n\r\nused  only in the Federation and we on our part  are\r\n\r\nspending  many millions of dollars every year  on  a\r\n\r\nNavy employing 84 per cent Federation subjects whose\r\n\r\noperational  duties are almost wholly in  Federation\r\n\r\nwaters  for  Federation  purposes.  We  receive   no\r\n\r\npayment  at all for these services. It can therefore\r\n\r\nbe  seen that we have no regular army units. We have\r\n\r\na  part-time  trained Singapore Military  Force.  We\r\n\r\nhave a particularly costly Navy beyond our immediate\r\n\r\nneeds  and  of  little value for  internal  security\r\n\r\npurposes and we have a well-trained Police Force  of\r\n\r\nsome  six  thousand persons. I am advised, Sir,  and\r\n\r\nthis  I  am  prepared  to  believe,  that  this   is\r\n\r\ninadequate for the maintenance of order in the event\r\n\r\nof  an  organised  and  maliciously  directed  major\r\n\r\noutburst  of violence. In the light of this  advice,\r\n\r\nthe   Government  is  proceeding  apace   with   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of an operational Singapore  Battalion\r\n\r\nby the 1st of April, 1957; and let me say this, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am told that even that may be difficult. We would\r\n\r\nbe  quite ready to raise two Battalions if that were\r\n\r\npossible  within the time. Even with that additional\r\n\r\nBattalion,  which is expected to be  operational  in\r\n\r\nApril,  1957,  we are advised that  it  would  be  a\r\n\r\nmatter of prudence for us to enter into arrangements\r\n\r\nwhereby  the Government of Singapore can  call  upon\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Forces for assistance in the event  of\r\n\r\nour  Forces being inadequate for the restoration  of\r\n\r\ninternal  security. We are very ready to enter  into\r\n\r\nany arrangement of that character, but it seems that\r\n\r\nthere is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  possibility that the United Kingdom  may  not  be\r\n\r\nprepared to give military assistance in the event of\r\n\r\ncomplete  breakdown of internal security  unless  it\r\n\r\nhas some control over the normal conduct of internal\r\n\r\nsecurity in this area. Frankly, Sir, our view of the\r\n\r\nmatter  is  very  simple. To cede any  control  over\r\n\r\ninternal   security  is  to  make   a   mockery   of\r\n\r\nindependence. We are or we are not free and  if  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's  Government insists on  control  over  our\r\n\r\ninternal security Forces, the Labour Front will  be\r\n\r\nno party to any agreement that may be arrived at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other facet of this question, Sir, is that the\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces may well desire some form of guarantee\r\n\r\nthat  the  external  defence installations  and  the\r\n\r\narrangements for external defence efficacy would not\r\n\r\nbe  prejudiced  by  a serious deterioration  of  the\r\n\r\ninternal  security position. Sir, this  question  is\r\n\r\nunder  very active consideration by Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  forming the All-Party Delegation and  by  our\r\n\r\nConstitutional  Adviser and I can say  that  we  are\r\n\r\nhopeful  that some acceptable formula can be arrived\r\n\r\nat. I do wish it understood, Sir, that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore go to this Constitutional Conference in  a\r\n\r\nspirit  of  utmost reasonableness prepared  to  seek\r\n\r\nwhat  is  just for all parties and not only what  is\r\n\r\nright for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have outlined, Sir, broadly, the framework of\r\n\r\nour  aspirations worked out with full  consideration\r\n\r\nfor  the interests of the United Kingdom as we  know\r\n\r\nit,  for  it must be understood that apart  from  an\r\n\r\nabortive attempt made from Switzerland for a  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of Colonial Office attitude on some of\r\n\r\nthe  issues,  I  have not been  in  touch  with  the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office either directly or  indirectly  and\r\n\r\nwhen  we do meet in London, we must anticipate  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  a contribution of  ideas  from  the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office  which  may materially  affect  our\r\n\r\nthinking   on  the  approach  to  the   problem   of\r\n\r\nprotecting  United  Kingdom  interests  within   the\r\n\r\nframework of our desire for an end to colonial rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, Sir, the answer to the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  (Mr Ede) is that we seek full  legislative\r\n\r\nautonomy   and   equality  in  status   with   other\r\n\r\nindependent members of the Commonwealth. We seek  an\r\n\r\nend  to  Official Members of the Council, an end  to\r\n\r\nOfficial  and Nominated Members of the Assembly  and\r\n\r\nan  end to all the Governor's veto powers. In  fact,\r\n\r\nSir,  under  the type of constitution  we  envisage,\r\n\r\nthere   will   be   no   Governor.   Her   Majesty's\r\n\r\nrepresentative  will have only  the  decorative  and\r\n\r\nnecessary  functions associated  with  the  monarchy\r\n\r\nunder parliamentary rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one other aspect of our talks in\r\n\r\nLondon on which I wish to touch. It is a matter that\r\n\r\nhas  been hovering like a small but persistent cloud\r\n\r\non the political horizon since first we took office.\r\n\r\nI  refer  to the citizenship question. I  think  the\r\n\r\nHouse is aware that the Labour Front considers  that\r\n\r\nthere  can be no true democracy unless there  is  an\r\n\r\nhonourable  solution of the citizenship problem.  It\r\n\r\nis  our  hope that the issue of citizenship will  be\r\n\r\nsolved   by  the  creation  of  a  single  Singapore\r\n\r\nnationality by the Singapore Independent  Act  which\r\n\r\nwe  seek  from  the United Kingdom to establish  our\r\n\r\nfreedom.  The House is aware of the firm  assurances\r\n\r\nof my hon. Friend the leader of the Alliance that he\r\n\r\nwould  support  provisions for  a  single  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship. Nevertheless, Sir, there does exist the\r\n\r\npossibility that the provision for citizenship  will\r\n\r\nbe  manoeuvred out of the main constitutional  talks\r\n\r\nand  should  that occur, Sir, I give the House  this\r\n\r\nassurance:  that  the  Labour  Front  Ministers   as\r\n\r\nMinisters of the Singapore Government will press  in\r\n\r\nLondon  and,  later, in Singapore, for a  clear  and\r\n\r\nearly  finalisation  of  this  issue  whatever   the\r\n\r\npolitical cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps it will be appropriate at this\r\n\r\njuncture  to  deal with some of the  objections  and\r\n\r\nwith  some  of the arguments we have heard  advanced\r\n\r\nagainst  the fulfilment of our aspirations.  We  who\r\n\r\nare  here are Malayans and it may well be that these\r\n\r\nobjections   will  not  find  voice  or   sufficient\r\n\r\nexpression  of  a  stridency  which  they  do   find\r\n\r\noutside,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  I  think  it is important that  the  people  of\r\n\r\nMalaya should know what the objections are and  that\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore should know what the answers\r\n\r\nare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one I will take, Sir, is one that is\r\n\r\nbeloved  of  Colonel Blimp. It goes  something  like\r\n\r\nthis:  \"Singapore was a swamp with  a  few  malarial\r\n\r\nfisherfolk. We bought it. We paid for it.  We  own\r\n\r\nit.  With our brains and capital, we made it one  of\r\n\r\nthe  greatest ports in the world and if you  do  not\r\n\r\nlike it, you can take a running jump to the land  of\r\n\r\nyour forefathers.\" Sir, the principal element in the\r\n\r\ngrowth of Singapore is its geographical position  at\r\n\r\na  time  of increasing trade between East and  West,\r\n\r\nand  not  even Blimp has suggested that the colonial\r\n\r\npower  should take credit for Singapore being  where\r\n\r\nit  is  or for the opening up of trade between  West\r\n\r\nand  East.  The  second main element of  Singapore's\r\n\r\ngrowth   is  the  amazing  adaptability,  mercantile\r\n\r\nacumen and vitality of our people and here, Sir,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  dishonest not to concede, and we  concede\r\n\r\nfreely,   that  British  administrative  traditions,\r\n\r\nBritish commercial acumen and British capital played\r\n\r\na  key  role in the commercial development  of  this\r\n\r\nport;  but  to  seek to hog the whole  credit  is  a\r\n\r\nshameless  perversion  of  the  truth - the  truth  of\r\n\r\nmagnificent co-operative effort between the  various\r\n\r\nraces,  both Eastern and Western, resident  in  this\r\n\r\nisland  for more than a century. Sir, even  if  this\r\n\r\nwere  not  so, even if it were not that  Singapore's\r\n\r\nprosperity is due to no single race but to practical\r\n\r\nand  harmonious partnership between different races,\r\n\r\nand  even if one could accept the legalistic concept\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  is owned by the United  Kingdom,  I\r\n\r\nwould  remind Members that one can own land but  one\r\n\r\ndoes not own human beings. Colonialism may have been\r\n\r\nadequate at a time when all were equally transients.\r\n\r\nToday  when  we  have more than a million  domiciled\r\n\r\ninhabitants, it is utterly untenable. Colonialism in\r\n\r\nsuch  circumstances,  Sir, corrupts  the  ruler  and\r\n\r\nwarps the ruled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having referred to Blimp, Sir, I think it would be\r\n\r\nappropriate to take cognizance, by way of  contrast,\r\n\r\nof a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroup of responsible British mercantile men who have\r\n\r\nwritten to me and agreed to the publication of their\r\n\r\nletter  indicating that they consider the  interests\r\n\r\nof   British   capital  and  British  community   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are identical with the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. This is the first gesture  of\r\n\r\ngoodwill and understanding on the part of this  very\r\n\r\nimportant community and I welcome it as one welcomes\r\n\r\nthe first flowers of Spring; for let this be clearly\r\n\r\nunderstood: the British community may be transients;\r\n\r\nBritish  capital  is not transient. British  capital\r\n\r\nhas  played  a  vital  role in  the  development  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and it has a vital role to  play  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture   development  of  Singapore.  We  need   the\r\n\r\nactivities  of  British capital and British  capital\r\n\r\nneeds the outlet of facilities of Singapore. We  can\r\n\r\nboth  benefit,  and  benefit  richly,  if  there  is\r\n\r\nstatesmanlike   acceptance  of  the  realities   and\r\n\r\ngenuine desire for friendly and honest co-operation.\r\n\r\nSir,  may  I take the opportunity of expressing  the\r\n\r\nhope  that  today at least Mr Sutherland,  who  has\r\n\r\nbeen  appointed to represent British capital in this\r\n\r\nAssembly, will be equal to his opportunity and  will\r\n\r\nbe  adequate  to interpret this new spirit  infusing\r\n\r\nthe  British community when he approaches the issues\r\n\r\ninvolved in this motion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another objection, Sir, which we have heard is\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  is too small to be  an  independent\r\n\r\nterritory.    Researches   of   our   constitutional\r\n\r\nadvisers,  Sir,  have  proved  that  Singapore  will\r\n\r\nlearn, when our memorandum to the Secretary of State\r\n\r\nis  published, that Singapore can proudly  take  its\r\n\r\nplace as an elder brother to many of the independent\r\n\r\nStates  who are members of the United Nations today,\r\n\r\nolder in the status of population and income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still another objection, Sir, is that the true\r\n\r\ndestiny  of  Singapore is as part of the concept  of\r\n\r\nthe great Malayan nation and that we should not seek\r\n\r\nindependence - an independence without meaning - outside\r\n\r\nthat  concept. I think this House is aware that  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  the Government of Singapore have  since\r\n\r\nlast  August repeatedly shown their realisation that\r\n\r\nonly unity between the Federation and Singapore  can\r\n\r\nbring into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing  a truly great Malayan nation and that without\r\n\r\nsuch  unity,  there  is grave  danger  to  the  very\r\n\r\nsurvival of both entities. I would like to make this\r\n\r\nclear,  Sir. We have both officially and  informally\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  suggested  to  the  Government  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation that urgent consideration should be given\r\n\r\nto  the  question of a merger so necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nhealthy growth of both units, but consideration  has\r\n\r\nbeen  as  repeatedly postponed first on  the  ground\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  as  a strategic  base  would  never\r\n\r\nachieve independence and could only be a drag on the\r\n\r\nFederation  which  was seeking its own  independence\r\n\r\nand  now,  Sir, on the ground that the  issue  would\r\n\r\ndelay  and  complicate  the recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission  on the Federation's future constitution.\r\n\r\nWe,  who  represent the people of Singapore in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  are deeply conscious of the elemental  truth\r\n\r\nthat  neither  territory can go far  along  separate\r\n\r\nways  and that in unity we have the potential  of  a\r\n\r\nnation  of  strength and stature. Also as  practical\r\n\r\nmen,  we  say  we cannot await the pleasure  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  before we seek an end to colonial  rule.\r\n\r\nOur   desire   for   a  merger  is  concurrent   but\r\n\r\nsubordinate   to   our  desire  for   freedom   from\r\n\r\ncolonialism.  One does not conflict with  the  other\r\n\r\nand if we do achieve independence, we shall still be\r\n\r\nhoping that the Federation will be equal to the rich\r\n\r\nopportunities which today's circumstances offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An objection of more substance, Sir, that seems to\r\n\r\nfind  an  echo  amongst some of our people  is  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  pursuing the goal of independence  at\r\n\r\nfar  too  rapid a pace. I do appreciate the courtesy\r\n\r\nof  our opponents in not reminding the Labour  Front\r\n\r\nthat   our  Four  Year  Programme  calls  for  self-government within four years but we, Sir, who  never\r\n\r\nseek  to shirk the truth, are conscious of that  and\r\n\r\nbeing conscious we say in all sincerity, \"Today,  we\r\n\r\nknow, delay could be, would be, fatal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since coming to office, Sir, we have learned that\r\n\r\nthe problem of Communism is of a far graver and more\r\n\r\npressing  character than we understood as  citizens,\r\n\r\nthat Communism is utilising\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe mask of nationalism in order to gain support and\r\n\r\nthrough  this  technique  is  endangering  the  very\r\n\r\nexistence  of  the people of this  island.  We  have\r\n\r\nlearned  that  you  cannot ask a subject  people  to\r\n\r\nassist  the colonial power to exterminate Communism.\r\n\r\nWe  of the Labour Front-Alliance Government have for\r\n\r\ntwelve  months been bedevilled in having  to  divide\r\n\r\nour  energies  between the struggle for  an  end  of\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule  and the struggle  against  the  true\r\n\r\nenemy of the people - the Communists. In such division\r\n\r\nof  effort, Sir, lies failure. Experience has taught\r\n\r\nus  also that it is in the highest degree unwise  to\r\n\r\nuse  the Oliver Twist technique of taking a  little\r\n\r\nand  being ready to go back for more. That way  lies\r\n\r\ninstability,  and  political  instability  in   this\r\n\r\nterritory is the very meat of Communism and  is  the\r\n\r\nvery  poison,  Sir, of our commercial existence.  We\r\n\r\nhave been reminded of this by the outgoing President\r\n\r\nof  the Singapore Chamber of Commerce but he did not\r\n\r\nindicate  the way to stability. Maybe the  way,  and\r\n\r\nthe  only way that any honest man can see,  was  one\r\n\r\nthat  was unpalatable to him. We believe, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nstable  conditions can only be achieved if there  is\r\n\r\nan  end to our struggle with the United Kingdom  and\r\n\r\nif   there  is  an  honourable  agreement  for   the\r\n\r\nforeseeable future guiding our relations. It is only\r\n\r\nif  we can feel, \"This is it. This is the end of our\r\n\r\nstruggle\",  that we can turn round and move  forward\r\n\r\nas  a  free  people united firmly  in  the  will  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  against the leprous forces of this  foreign\r\n\r\nideology  we call Communism. That is the only  hope,\r\n\r\nSir, to stability and the time is now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are those who say. \"Go slow.\" Sir, when the\r\n\r\nembryo in the egg grows to the point of being  ready\r\n\r\nto  peck its way through to the free world and fresh\r\n\r\nair, does it make any sense to say. \"Go slow, little\r\n\r\nchicken.  Stay a few more days there. Grow  stronger\r\n\r\nand  bigger  so that you can better meet the  wicked\r\n\r\nweather  of  this  world\"?  To  go  slow  in   those\r\n\r\ncircumstances  would mean death. To stay  longer  in\r\n\r\nthat  egg  would mean suffocation. Unless, Sir,  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore can, in the words of Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNehru,  \"savour the sensation of freedom\", the  time\r\n\r\nwill  be  too late to call upon them for  that  mass\r\n\r\ndynamic  effort  to meet the peril that  is  already\r\n\r\nwithin our gates. It is not the bullets of the armed\r\n\r\nforces that will save us from Communism. It is  only\r\n\r\nthe  spirit of the people and you can only have that\r\n\r\nspirit  if  the people are free. So, Sir, though  in\r\n\r\nour humility we have originally envisaged four years\r\n\r\nfor  self-government, we say, \"After twelve  months'\r\n\r\nexperience, in all sincerity, today is not too  soon\r\n\r\nfor independence.\" In fact, Sir, the brutal truth is\r\n\r\nthat today may be too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have earlier indicated what I consider to\r\n\r\nhave been the very valuable activities of the public-spirited  people of Singapore during  Merdeka  Week.\r\n\r\nOne  aspect  of  Merdeka  Week,  however,  Sir,  has\r\n\r\nbrought  to  light an objection that was  till  then\r\n\r\ndormant. The disorderly conduct of a small crowd  at\r\n\r\nthe  end of the rally of the 18th of March has  been\r\n\r\nso  exaggerated, so repeatedly played up in an  able\r\n\r\nPress  campaign that it has transformed the incident\r\n\r\ninto   fantastic   proportions   with   considerable\r\n\r\npsychological  repercussions. Sections  of  minority\r\n\r\nraces  in  Singapore  who till then  were  happy  to\r\n\r\nenvisage  the  possibility  of  an  early   end   to\r\n\r\ncolonialism have been whipped up to a pitch of  fear\r\n\r\nof  possible subjugation by the Chinese  people.  As\r\n\r\none  man put it, Sir, \"If freedom means the rule  of\r\n\r\nthe majority, you are going to replace the arrogance\r\n\r\nof  the  Englishman by the arrogance of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nWhat  do we benefit? We prefer the devil we know  to\r\n\r\nthe devil we do not know.\" Sir, an insidious part of\r\n\r\nthis  campaign has been to associate the dangers  of\r\n\r\nCommunism  with  the  natural  predominance  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese in a democracy. Sir, the minority races are,\r\n\r\nin  fact, somewhat confused as to what they fear. It\r\n\r\nis  a  composite  picture of fearing  what  one  man\r\n\r\ncalled,  \"Peking Merdeka\". Sir, in every  democratic\r\n\r\ncountry, there are minorities and the protection  of\r\n\r\nminority  rights is inherent in the very concept  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.    Sometimes,    such    protection    is\r\n\r\nincorporated in a constitution. At other  times,  it\r\n\r\nis just understood, Sir. It is part of the very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbreath of that concept of political institutions  we\r\n\r\ncall  \"parliamentary democracy\". For democracy  does\r\n\r\nnot  merely mean the rule of the majority. It  means\r\n\r\nthe  rule  of the majority taking full consideration\r\n\r\nof  the  needs  and the interests  of  all  minority\r\n\r\nraces. Merdeka does not mean, Sir, and it can  never\r\n\r\nmean,  the  replacement  of  English  arrogance   by\r\n\r\nChinese  arrogance, English rule  by  Chinese  rule.\r\n\r\nMerdeka means the replacement of English rule by our\r\n\r\nown  rule,  the rule of the people of  Singapore  of\r\n\r\nwhom  the majority are Chinese, and we can naturally\r\n\r\nexpect  that  they will be prominent and predominant\r\n\r\nin  shaping the policies of Government. It  is  very\r\n\r\nwrong,  Sir,  to  assume that  our  Chinese  fellow-\r\n\r\ncitizens would find the wine of power so heady as to\r\n\r\ngo  berserk  and seek the destruction of  legitimate\r\n\r\nminority  interests. It is wrong  not  to  give  our\r\n\r\nfellow-citizens the credit for the very real virtues\r\n\r\nwhich they possess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, Sir, that in the past few months,\r\n\r\nthere  has been greater prominence placed on certain\r\n\r\nunhappy  aspects of the activities of small sections\r\n\r\nof  our  country's population but let  us  recognise\r\n\r\nthat,  for generations, the Chinese have had a  very\r\n\r\nraw deal. I am of a minority race through centuries,\r\n\r\nSir. I  can  recognise and feel for  discriminatory\r\n\r\ntreatment towards minority races and my heart  feels\r\n\r\nand  understands the bitterness in the hearts of the\r\n\r\nChinese    who   have   for   generations   received\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory  minority  race  treatment  in   this\r\n\r\nterritory. This is the heritage of decades but  when\r\n\r\nthey receive full recognition, full participation in\r\n\r\ngovernment  and when, in fact, they find  that  they\r\n\r\nare  largely  responsible for  the  conduct  of  the\r\n\r\ngovernment,  I  believe that there will  flower  not\r\n\r\nChinese   arrogance  but  the  Chinese  virtues   of\r\n\r\nreasonableness  and of justice. The  Chinese  are  a\r\n\r\nvital  race and they have a great deal to contribute\r\n\r\nto  the future. We should rather look forward to the\r\n\r\nflowering  of  their virtues in  common  with  other\r\n\r\nraces  in this territory under the just reign  of  a\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only argument of any validity which I\r\n\r\nhave  heard  is that in normal times my analysis  of\r\n\r\nthe   development  of  the  Chinese   community   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  might  be right but today  we  are  going\r\n\r\nthrough  an  abnormal period of  militant  Communist\r\n\r\nexpansion rampant in Asia viewing Singapore  as  the\r\n\r\nideal point for further expansion in South-East Asia\r\n\r\nand,  in  these  conditions,  we  can  expect  heavy\r\n\r\npressure  of  indoctrination on local  citizens  for\r\n\r\nsubversive  Communist purposes and  that,  in  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  we  can expect tactics  to  maintain\r\n\r\nbitterness,  to  maintain and  sharpen  inter-racial\r\n\r\nantagonism  and to prevent consolidation of  Chinese\r\n\r\nloyalty  and co-operation to the land. It is  argued\r\n\r\nthat  Communists are never in the majority when they\r\n\r\ntake  power but act as a well-disciplined  minority.\r\n\r\nTheir technique is to mislead workers, peasants  and\r\n\r\nstudents, to work up discontent and chaos  and  then\r\n\r\nby  surprise  action to seek to slit the  throat  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy and take over control and once in control,\r\n\r\nSir,  that is the end of human liberties; for though\r\n\r\none  can  turn  out the Progressive Party - one  might\r\n\r\neven  hope  to  turn out the Labour Front  Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment - once   a  Communist   or   a   Communist-camouflaged  Party is in power, there  are  no  more\r\n\r\nelections and all is tyranny. I will not deny,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  that  is the danger. It is a very real  danger\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  not  a danger which we  can  escape  by\r\n\r\nrefusing  to grow. It is not a danger we can  escape\r\n\r\nby  remaining  a  Colony. It  is  a  danger  we  can\r\n\r\novercome only if the people of Singapore can act  as\r\n\r\na  united,  intelligent and loyal  group,  and  this\r\n\r\nincludes  the Chinese people as well as all minority\r\n\r\nraces.  We  must act as one to preserve our  freedom\r\n\r\nand  the  heritage  of  our children.  This  is  our\r\n\r\ndanger. This is also our opportunity and a wonderful\r\n\r\nand  dynamic  opportunity; for in the face  of  this\r\n\r\ndanger,  we must be conscious that we either produce\r\n\r\na  united people with full co-operation between  all\r\n\r\nraces,  with  full  trust  between  all  races   and\r\n\r\ncomplete  loyalty of all races to Singapore,  or  we\r\n\r\nperish. If we succeed, Sir, we might well make  this\r\n\r\nsmall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoint  on the map of the world the centre of  a  new\r\n\r\nstabilising force for the whole of Asia.

I have lived under it all\r\n\r\nmy   life  and  I  hate  Communism  because  I  hate\r\n\r\ncolonialism and because Communism is a more  vicious\r\n\r\nand more brutal concept of colonialism. If I thought\r\n\r\nthat  independence would bring about the tyranny  of\r\n\r\nCommunism in this territory, I would fight  Merdeka.\r\n\r\nI  do say, Sir, I believe that it is through Merdeka\r\n\r\nthat there is any hope of reaching safety and I  say\r\n\r\nto  the  people of Singapore - all races - that we  must\r\n\r\nhave  faith in ourselves. We must have faith in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  This is the road of life, Sir, the road  of\r\n\r\nnatural  growth through freedom with all its dangers\r\n\r\nand  with  all its opportunities and the  road  lies\r\n\r\nthrough Merdeka.

Because  my  forefathers\r\n\r\nmigrated for purely selfish economic reasons to what\r\n\r\nthey call the South Seas, a whole generation of some\r\n\r\ntwo  million  Chinese are today left in Malaya  with\r\n\r\nMalaya  as their only home and, necessarily thereby,\r\n\r\nthe  sole  object of their loyalty.  The  generation\r\n\r\nthat  I  belong  to  grew up under British  colonial\r\n\r\nrule.  It is always easy to say, \"Let us forget  the\r\n\r\npast.  After  all, that was colonialism.  It  was  a\r\n\r\nmistake.  Now,  let us get together and  let  us  be\r\n\r\nfriends.\"  Commendable sentiment, Sir,  and  one  to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  would subscribe if I found that there  was\r\n\r\nsufficient sincerity on the other side. If I believe\r\n\r\nthat  the British are no longer interested in either\r\n\r\neconomic,   political  or  military  advantages   to\r\n\r\nthemselves  more than to me, then there would  be  a\r\n\r\nbasis  for friendly, comradely cooperation. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  problem which faces Britain and the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the high-sounding words have died down,\r\n\r\none  has to search one's conscience and say,  \"Am  I\r\n\r\nhappier  this  way  or that way?\"  Speaking  for  my\r\n\r\nParty,  I  do  not think that we have the  slightest\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  we are happier if British control  were\r\n\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have thought myself that the first part of\r\n\r\nthe  preamble  would  have embarrassed  the  British\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister.  It  was  only  recently  that  the\r\n\r\nconstitution of British Guiana was suspended. It was\r\n\r\nsaid  that there, a great error had been made; that,\r\n\r\nin  fact, self-determination is only possible  where\r\n\r\nyou  have  an educated and an enlightened electorate\r\n\r\nand not where you have largely an uneducated mass of\r\n\r\npeople incapable of thinking for themselves but  led\r\n\r\nby  political extremists. I shall come back to  that\r\n\r\npoint at a later stage, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second half which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"And its belief that the long term welfare of\r\n\r\nSingapore  lies  in  close and friendly  cooperation\r\n\r\nwith   the   United  Kingdom  and  the  Commonwealth\r\n\r\nterritories;\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I think it is safe to say that no country in Asia or\r\n\r\nindeed  any  part  of the world, unless  it  is  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States of America or the Soviet  Union,  can\r\n\r\nstand  by itself and pursue a completely independent\r\n\r\npolicy. We live in an age where balance of power  in\r\n\r\nthe  old  sense  of the word has been modified  into\r\n\r\nbalance   of  regional  power  groups.  The  British\r\n\r\nCommonwealth is such a power group and as long as it\r\n\r\nis to the interest of countries like India, Pakistan\r\n\r\nand  Ceylon to stay within the British Commonwealth,\r\n\r\nthen  it might be to our interest to be part of this\r\n\r\nco-operative  experimental  enterprise.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthere  were  the  cynics who,  when  India  got  her\r\n\r\nindependence  and  stayed within  the  Commonwealth,\r\n\r\nsaid  that  it was not without an eye to  the  large\r\n\r\nsterling  balances then owing by the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nto  the  Indian Government. I would like to  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the Indian leaders honestly and sincerely felt\r\n\r\nthat  perhaps the old world concept of narrow, rigid\r\n\r\nnationalistic boundaries and racialistic  approaches\r\n\r\nshould  slowly give way to a wider and more liberal,\r\n\r\na  more humane and satisfying fellowship of all men.\r\n\r\nThe  British Commonwealth is perhaps unique  in  the\r\n\r\nhistory of empires in that it did not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrumble  into dust and break away into its component\r\n\r\nparts  when  the  centrifugal force broke  down.  If\r\n\r\nthere  had not been World War II, if there  had  not\r\n\r\nbeen  the Japanese occupation, a lot of things  that\r\n\r\nwe talk about today would not have happened. The old\r\n\r\npattern broke down after the end of the Second World\r\n\r\nWar.  The astonishing thing is that even though  the\r\n\r\npower  which governs by force is gone, a new pattern\r\n\r\nof  that  empire, perhaps at this stage an amorphous\r\n\r\nconcept, has somehow emerged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us in Singapore, or even if we were to add the\r\n\r\nFederation; for us in Malaya, it is not possible  to\r\n\r\nmake  any decisive changes in the course of  history\r\n\r\nin  South-East  Asia. There are bigger, larger  and\r\n\r\nmore  decisive forces than Malayan nationalism.  But\r\n\r\none thing is certain. We cannot survive by ourselves\r\n\r\nin  the international world unless we also belong to\r\n\r\nsome  group. It may well be that, like Siam, we  can\r\n\r\nplay off one side against the other and always trust\r\n\r\nto  the  United Nations Security Council to  prevent\r\n\r\neither  of the two big power blocs from toppling  us\r\n\r\non  to  their  side irrevocably. But  for  the  time\r\n\r\nbeing, as long as some 300 million Indians find that\r\n\r\nit  is  an  advantage to remain within  the  British\r\n\r\nCommonwealth,  there is no reason why seven  million\r\n\r\nMalayans should not continue on a friendly basis the\r\n\r\nassociations  of  trade  and  commerce   and   other\r\n\r\ncultural  activities that have existed  for  over  a\r\n\r\nhundred years between us and the British. All  this,\r\n\r\nof course, presupposes that after April, we will get\r\n\r\na constitutional advance. I hope we will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three things that the British Government\r\n\r\ncan  do:  meet  us the whole way, meet us  somewhere\r\n\r\nalong the way, or not budge at all. Taking the three\r\n\r\nalternatives in the reverse order, if  they  do  not\r\n\r\nbudge  at  all:  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  has\r\n\r\nalready  indicated that he does not propose to  stay\r\n\r\nin  office.  In other words, the British  Government\r\n\r\nmust be prepared to revoke the constitution and  run\r\n\r\nSingapore  once  again as a Crown  colony  in  every\r\n\r\nsense  of  the  word.  The long-term  consequences - I\r\n\r\nwould not say the immediate conse-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquences,   for   those   can   be   controlled   and\r\n\r\ncontained - of such a policy would be catastrophic  to\r\n\r\nthe   British.   Whether   it   would   be   equally\r\n\r\ncatastrophic to Malaya depends upon one's  point  of\r\n\r\nview,  whether one believes in \"revolution\" as  used\r\n\r\nby Marxists or whether one believes in revolution as\r\n\r\nused  by Laski. I prefer, not because I am incapable\r\n\r\nof warlike activities, the evolutionary approach. It\r\n\r\nis  less  painful and everybody feels a  little  bit\r\n\r\nbetter about it when it is all over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe for one moment that Her Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  the  United  Kingdom  is  completely\r\n\r\nignorant  of  the underlying political situation  in\r\n\r\nMalaya  and,  therefore, I am  personally  convinced\r\n\r\nthat   it   would  take  a  lot  of   other   secret\r\n\r\nconsiderations  before the British Government  says,\r\n\r\n\"No, and absolutely no!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other two alternatives, if one were to\r\n\r\nput  them in the balance, the logical conclusion  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  British Government will find it  wise  to\r\n\r\nmeet  us all along the way. To meet us part  of  the\r\n\r\nway  would  just  sour any possible political  kudos\r\n\r\nthat might be obtained from a graceful withdrawal. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  any country in the  world  can  more\r\n\r\ngracefully   withdraw  from  an  already   untenable\r\n\r\nposition  than the British. I think they understand,\r\n\r\nand  I  hope  the six prominent gentlemen  from  the\r\n\r\nBritish  House  of Commons will help the  others  to\r\n\r\nunderstand,   that  this  is  almost   \"an   already\r\n\r\nuntenable position\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Party manifesto says, \"We believe in\r\n\r\nimmediate independence.\" Perhaps the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister will forgive me if I spend a few minutes in\r\n\r\nexplaining   to  the  House  why  the   P.A.P. has\r\n\r\napparently departed from this stand. So many  things\r\n\r\nhave  happened in Singapore since the elections held\r\n\r\nin March last year that sometimes one feels that one\r\n\r\nhas  lived  through a decade, not just a  year.  One\r\n\r\nthing  is  fairly  certain. No individual  political\r\n\r\nforce is in control in Malaya. The British when they\r\n\r\nput  in  the Rendel Constitution believed, and  they\r\n\r\nthought they were right in believing, that it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  lead  to  a  mild,  gradual  phasing  of  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  stages  of evolution  towards  this  very\r\n\r\ndesirable state of self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. took the lid off the last\r\n\r\nelections and out popped the Labour Front.  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nthis  three-cornered  fight  that  is  going  on  in\r\n\r\nMalaya - the   British,   the   Communists   and   the\r\n\r\nNationalists - the position will not  be  re-patterned\r\n\r\nif  the  British freeze the constitution.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nsimple  problem if one approaches it from the  local\r\n\r\nman's point of view. Every time the Communist fights\r\n\r\nthe  British, the Nationalist says to himself,  \"Ah,\r\n\r\ngood,  that will weaken him and perhaps I will  come\r\n\r\nin.\"  Every  time the Nationalist gives the  British\r\n\r\none hard knock, the Communist says, \"Good show. That\r\n\r\nwill knock him out. Then I will come in.\" As long as\r\n\r\nthe  British are here the common target, the  common\r\n\r\nfoe  are the British. It is not possible to face the\r\n\r\nquestion  \"What Malaya are we going  to  have?\"  The\r\n\r\nimmediate  question  is, \"Can  we  get  rid  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish?\"  A  very  eminent old  gentleman  who  was\r\n\r\nknighted by the British Government and who is  still\r\n\r\nvery much alive once told me in an unguarded moment,\r\n\r\nwhich  might  have  cost him the revocation  of  his\r\n\r\nknighthood  if he had been overheard, \"I don't  like\r\n\r\nthe Communists but every time they beat the British,\r\n\r\nI  say  'Good,  I have got a better  chance  to  win\r\n\r\nnow.'\"  It is the most natural sentiment,  the  most\r\n\r\nnatural reaction when you are fighting a common foe.\r\n\r\nWhen the British fought the Germans, they were great\r\n\r\nfriends  with  Marshal Stalin and  they  fought  the\r\n\r\nGermans  together. I say that if  such  a  situation\r\n\r\ngoes on much longer, the outcome will be victory  to\r\n\r\nthe  local  force that is more tightly organised  to\r\n\r\nseize  power.  Eventually a point  will  be  reached\r\n\r\nwhere, like the French in Indo China, the Colony  is\r\n\r\nno  longer worthwhile, and then they say. \"Well, let\r\n\r\nus  call  a  halt to it\" and, as in Indo-China,  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party  being the most  tightly  organised\r\n\r\ngroup naturally took the leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been two patterns of development in\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia since the war. One  is  the  Indian\r\n\r\npattern and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  is  the Indo-Chinese pattern. In  the  Indian\r\n\r\npattern,  you had a nationalist group there  leading\r\n\r\nthe fight against the British long before the Indian\r\n\r\nCommunist Party ever came into being. They  had  the\r\n\r\ninitiative.  They  had  the organisation.  They  had\r\n\r\nattracted all the men with the guts and the  ability\r\n\r\nand the desire for freedom. When the time came, they\r\n\r\nwere able to assume power as of right, for power  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  counter to be bargained for and handed over.\r\n\r\nPower is something to be fought for and won. If  you\r\n\r\nhave  the  wherewithal to take it  and  to  run  it,\r\n\r\nnothing will stop you. The difficulty for Malaya  is\r\n\r\nthat,  unlike India, there was a Communist  movement\r\n\r\nsome   thirty  years  before  the  first  spark   of\r\n\r\nnationalism  spread and caught  fire.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nproblem  which we face today in Malaya, not just  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  though  some people  in  the  Federation\r\n\r\nmight  wish  to  believe that the situation  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation is something different. It is a situation\r\n\r\nwhich is endemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Party believes in an independent,\r\n\r\ndemocratic,   non-Communist   Malaya:   independent,\r\n\r\nbecause we want to get rid of the British or anybody\r\n\r\nelse  who  wants  to  run this country;  democratic,\r\n\r\nbecause we want to elect our leaders by popular  and\r\n\r\nfree  elections; non-Communist, because we want free\r\n\r\nelections,  not  a  choice on a  straight  one-Party\r\n\r\nticket, and because we do not want to be involved in\r\n\r\na  fight  between  two world power blocs  and  power\r\n\r\nideologies. To a certain extent, it might be  termed\r\n\r\nan  escapist  philosophy. It may be that  ultimately\r\n\r\none  has to choose. The time may come. When it does,\r\n\r\nperhaps India will have to opt, and when India opts,\r\n\r\nI  think the whole of South-East Asia will opt  with\r\n\r\nher.  The destiny of Malaya will be determined  more\r\n\r\nby  forces  outside  Malaya than  by  forces  inside\r\n\r\nMalaya. No one could have foreseen after the war the\r\n\r\ntremendous change that would occur when the Imperial\r\n\r\npowers  disappeared from Asia.  No  one  could  have\r\n\r\nforeseen  the  emergence of a tightly organised  and\r\n\r\neffective  China.  No one could have  believed  that\r\n\r\nwithin ten years of the end of the war, the British\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment would decide that the time had come for a\r\n\r\nradical  change of policy. It took them a long  time\r\n\r\nto decide this. They tried General Templer first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I may be wrong in my appraisal of the\r\n\r\nsituation.  I  may  be wrong in believing  that  the\r\n\r\nBritish  have weighed the situation and have decided\r\n\r\nthat  the  best way to meet such a situation  is  to\r\n\r\nremove  themselves from the Malayan political arena.\r\n\r\nIf  I  am  wrong, then I have no choice and then  it\r\n\r\nbecomes  a straightforward fight between the British\r\n\r\nversus  the rest. But if I am right in my  appraisal\r\n\r\nof  the  situation, that if the British have decided\r\n\r\nthat  in  any  event they will lose and  they  would\r\n\r\nrather  lose to those who might carry on the liberal\r\n\r\nforms   of   government  which  the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nreferred to as parliamentary democracy, then, if  we\r\n\r\ncan  provide  that  other  force,  I  think  British\r\n\r\ninterest - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Instead  of  going  the   whole\r\n\r\ndistance,  we  therefore go  part  of  the  distance\r\n\r\ntowards independence. But I must say this: no  self-respecting Nationalist can say that that would be  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  state of affairs  for  any  length  of\r\n\r\ntime.  I  do  not know about Oliver Twist.  I  never\r\n\r\nliked Charles Dickens. But I do know this. As a step\r\n\r\ntowards independence and to seek common ground  with\r\n\r\nevery political Party in this House, we join in this\r\n\r\ndemand  that  we  should  have  the  status  of   an\r\n\r\nindependent State conceding or offering an agreement\r\n\r\nwhereby we lose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  foreign affairs and defence.  This  can\r\n\r\nonly  be  a  phase. It is impossible for  it  to  be\r\n\r\notherwise.  No man can formally postulate  that  you\r\n\r\nwill  be  always  not quite a full  man.  There  are\r\n\r\nforces in Asia more powerful than the British. It is\r\n\r\nmy hope that all the Nationalist groups in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Malaya will be alive to the identity  of  their\r\n\r\ncommon  interests  and  will  together,  not  as  an\r\n\r\nindependent Singapore and an independent  Federation\r\n\r\nbut  together,  as one unit, seek, in  the  not  too\r\n\r\ndistant future, that complete nationhood. Either you\r\n\r\nfight for that, or else you give up the struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After April, we will probably have a new\r\n\r\nconstitution. It will probably be one which  can  be\r\n\r\nrevoked - a revocable constitution - but the change that\r\n\r\nwill  take  place  in  the mind  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is an irrevocable one, just as the  change\r\n\r\nthat took place with the Rendel Constitution was  an\r\n\r\nirrevocable change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The astonishing thing about political events in\r\n\r\nSingapore is that very few realise at the time  they\r\n\r\nhappen  the  full  significance of the  events.  The\r\n\r\nProgressive Party did not know nor did they  imagine\r\n\r\nthat  when  they  gave  way to  adult  suffrage  and\r\n\r\nautomatic  registration, it meant political  suicide\r\n\r\nfor  a  small  English  educated  middle-class-based\r\n\r\nParty, and I do not think this House, when it agreed\r\n\r\nto  multi-lingualism, really understood  that  there\r\n\r\nwas  a  permanent  change in the  whole  concept  of\r\n\r\ngovernment in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

I take it that the hon.\r\n\r\nMember's  speech is on Malayanisation in  connection\r\n\r\nwith the Merdeka Mission?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is so, Mr Speaker, Sir. I fully understand the line of\r\n\r\ndemarcation you have allowed on this motion  on  the\r\n\r\nadjournment,  that I can only speak  in  so  far  as\r\n\r\nMalayanisation   is  connected  with   the   Merdeka\r\n\r\nMission.  Of  course, it does to  a  certain  extent\r\n\r\nconscribe the limits of the subject that I  wish  to\r\n\r\ncover  but  I  shall endeavour to  keep  within  the\r\n\r\nlimits you have laid down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is common knowledge that the\r\n\r\nMerdeka  Delegation is going to  take  with  it  the\r\n\r\nSecretary of the Malayanisation Commission to advise\r\n\r\non  matters connected therewith. I  think it is also\r\n\r\ncommon knowledge that the Director of Personnel (Mr\r\n\r\nHigham) will also be in London presumably to  advise\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies on\r\n\r\nmatters connected with Malayanisation and personnel.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  do not understand is what we are  going  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss   with  the  Secretary  of  State  for   the\r\n\r\nColonies.  In  the  sitting  last  month   of   this\r\n\r\nAssembly, the Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary indicated that he hoped that nothing  will\r\n\r\nbe  said  which  will  put the scare  into  European\r\n\r\nofficers. He then stood up and gave them a firm  and\r\n\r\ncategorical  assurance that until these matters  had\r\n\r\nbeen discussed in London, there will be no change in\r\n\r\nthe  status  quo.  As far as I can  see,  the  only\r\n\r\nmatter we want discussed and which the Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState  for  the  Colonies can  conceivably  want  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss with us on the question of Malayanisation is\r\n\r\nthe subject of abolition terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Colonial Paper 197 of 1946, which is now\r\n\r\nfamous or notorious by the repeated number of  times\r\n\r\nit  has  been cited by the local Staff Side  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service, the then Secretary of State for  the\r\n\r\nColonies stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If progressive advancement along the road to self-government within the framework of the British\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  of  Nations is to be  a  reality,  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Services of the Colonies must be adapted  to\r\n\r\nlocal  conditions, and must to the greatest possible\r\n\r\nextent be staffed by local people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can see, there is no quarrel with the\r\n\r\nprinciple of Malayanisation to the greatest possible\r\n\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are six terms of reference in the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission set out in the  letter  of\r\n\r\nappointment signed by the Hon. the Chief  Secretary.\r\n\r\nIt says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"And whereas the Governor in Council has deemed it\r\n\r\nexpedient  and  in the interests of  public  welfare\r\n\r\nthat  a  diligent and full examination  and  inquiry\r\n\r\nshould forthwith be made into the following matters,\r\n\r\nnamely:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Schemes of Service and the present\r\n\r\nstaffing  of  all  Government Departments  and\r\n\r\nAgencies  with a view to recommending measures\r\n\r\nto  ensure  the  more  rapid,  systematic  and\r\n\r\ncomplete Malayanisation of the Public Service;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The possibilities of including or expanding\r\n\r\ndegree  or diploma courses of study in  Public\r\n\r\nAdministration and Social Studies with a  view\r\n\r\nto enabling the Government to draw on a larger\r\n\r\nfield of graduates for the Public Service  and\r\n\r\nfor   that   purpose  to  consult   with   all\r\n\r\neducational authorities;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The existing schemes of training including the\r\n\r\nmaking   of  recommendations  for   the   more\r\n\r\nintensive  training of local  officers  within\r\n\r\nGovernment departments and agencies;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The abolition terms which might be offered to\r\n\r\nexpatriate officers in the Public Service and the\r\n\r\nmaking of recommendations in respect thereof;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Public Services Commission Ordinance, 1949\r\n\r\n(No. 55 of 1949) and its operation and to make such\r\n\r\nrecommendations as may be deemed necessary;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The question of Pan-Malayan departments in\r\n\r\ntheir   relationship   to   the   policy    of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Six  terms of references and not one of them, except\r\n\r\nNo.  4 which is \"the abolition terms which might  be\r\n\r\noffered\",  concerns the Secretary of State  for  the\r\n\r\nColonies.  The Secretary of State for  the  Colonies\r\n\r\nhas a right to discuss with the future government of\r\n\r\nSingapore  the  question of what its civil  servants\r\n\r\nshould  be  paid off with and by whom.  But  on  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  Malayanisation,  on  the  five  other\r\n\r\nmatters  set  out  in  the  instructions  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernor  to  the Commission, there is no  room  for\r\n\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister said on the Budget\r\n\r\ndebate   when   he  pressed  the  appointments   and\r\n\r\nupgrading of certain Europeans in certain expatriate\r\n\r\nposts   that  he  was  awaiting  the  Malayanisation\r\n\r\nCommission's Report. We have the Report now. It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  tabled  for  over a month. It  is  an  interim\r\n\r\nReport insofar as it has further reports to make  on\r\n\r\ngovernment  agencies but there is no further  report\r\n\r\non  the question of Malayanisation of the government\r\n\r\nitself.  I  must  say that we are disappointed  that\r\n\r\nthere  has  been no Government policy formulated  in\r\n\r\nany  White Paper. This has led to uncertainty as  to\r\n\r\nthe  extent to which the Report will be accepted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government. We then said that  the  Report  was\r\n\r\ncoming  and before it was even published, we  had  a\r\n\r\nfeeling that it might not be a sort of Report  which\r\n\r\nwill  delight the hearts of those who wanted freedom\r\n\r\nto  come slowly to Malaya. We are happy to see  that\r\n\r\nin this Report in which every political Party had  a\r\n\r\nmember  or representative who signed the Report,  it\r\n\r\nis  suggested, broadly speaking, that we can do away\r\n\r\nwith expatriate staff in about two or three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think it is fair\r\n\r\nto press the Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister for a clear declaration of policy. I expect\r\n\r\nthe Hon. the Chief Secretary will answer what is the\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention. One thing is clear: if it is\r\n\r\nthe intention of the Colonial Office to make this  a\r\n\r\nbargaining counter, we shall resist. Merdeka  or  no\r\n\r\nMerdeka, Malayanisation goes on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

So much the\r\n\r\nbetter, but even without Merdeka, let us take charge\r\n\r\nof the control room, as this Report puts it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are parts of this Report which I think\r\n\r\nthe  House would forgive me if I make reference  to.\r\n\r\nThe introduction reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Self-government would be an empty phrase unless\r\n\r\nthe   government  is  entirely  or  almost  entirely\r\n\r\ncarried out by the people of the country and to have\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Service staffed by expatriates  at  the\r\n\r\nhighest   levels   where  policy   formulation   and\r\n\r\nexecution  take  place would be  derogatory  to  the\r\n\r\ndignity  of the people of a self-governing  country.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  self-government and  Malayanisation  are\r\n\r\nclosely  related,  and  in  order  to  satisfy  this\r\n\r\nlegitimate aspiration complete Malayanisation should\r\n\r\nas  far as possible not lag behind the attainment of\r\n\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to place the subject in its proper setting\r\n\r\nwe  should see it in historical perspective. History\r\n\r\nshows that a group of people can only function as an\r\n\r\nentity  if  there is cohesion within the group,  and\r\n\r\nthis   cohesion  does  not  depend  merely  on   the\r\n\r\nhomogeneity of the population but on the sameness of\r\n\r\npurpose  created  by  the  stimulus  of  the  common\r\n\r\ngeographical  and human environment,  and  can  only\r\n\r\nexist if the people are thrown together to brave the\r\n\r\nsame dangers and share the same fate.

Any  Party  that\r\n\r\nwithdraws  from this Report will find  itself  in  a\r\n\r\nvery  uncomfortable position in the  next  election,\r\n\r\nand   there   will  be  a  next  election   if   the\r\n\r\nconstitution is not suspended.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the English educated class that  hopes\r\n\r\nto man the administrative machinery in the immediate\r\n\r\nfuture   when   the  white  man  leaves,   I   hope,\r\n\r\ngracefully, can, if given the opportunity, rise  up\r\n\r\nto  the  situation which confronts this country.

[Interruption.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, we say when we go to London\r\n\r\nwith  this  Merdeka Mission, we  are  not  going  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  the rights or wrongs of Malayanisation  and\r\n\r\nthe  speed at which we will do it. We are  going  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss what the Secretary of State for the Colonies\r\n\r\nhas a right to discuss, namely, abolition terms - what\r\n\r\nshall we pay them for the misfortune of having  made\r\n\r\ntheir  careers  in a country that grew  to  maturity\r\n\r\nwhilst  they  were  serving. But  if  there  is  the\r\n\r\nslightest suggestion that we will discuss details of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation policy, I think it is only fair  that\r\n\r\nwe should tell the Staff Side which has made all the\r\n\r\nrepresentations  to  the  Malayanisation  Commission\r\n\r\nthat it will be so discussed in order that they  can\r\n\r\nalso   have   their  views  put  to   the   Colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Forgive me, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nI  would  remind  the House that this Malayanisation\r\n\r\nCommission was appointed by the Government and  that\r\n\r\nMalayanisation is a policy which was  outlined  from\r\n\r\nthe Chair by His Excellency the Governor on the 22nd\r\n\r\nof  April,  1955, and that in effect for  the  first\r\n\r\ntime in Singapore's history, Malayanisation has been\r\n\r\na  reality from the moment that this Government came\r\n\r\ninto office because there has been no recruitment as\r\n\r\nfrom   that  time  except  with  the  consent,  full\r\n\r\nknowledge   and  full  debate  of  the  Council   of\r\n\r\nMinisters  in  respect of each and every  individual\r\n\r\ncase  where it has been considered necessary to  put\r\n\r\nup  a suggestion that we should take in expatriates.\r\n\r\nSir,  with  this  background,  this  Government  had\r\n\r\nappointed this Commission. It is the confidence that\r\n\r\nthis  Government had in the men which has  put  them\r\n\r\nwhere they are. It seems to me as somewhat absurd to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that this Government intends  to  welch  on\r\n\r\nMalayanisation except, of course, in order  to  give\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. credit  for  seeking  to  act  in  loco\r\n\r\nparentis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of the delay in putting a\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper before this Assembly after the  receipt\r\n\r\nof  the  Malayanisation Commission Report, I thought\r\n\r\nit has been explained fully and I thought that there\r\n\r\nwas no question of ambiguity. The Secretary of State\r\n\r\nfor  the Colonies and, in fact, the Colonial Office,\r\n\r\nat  all times, in similar cases, take the view  that\r\n\r\nthey have a certain responsibility to the people  of\r\n\r\nthe  country and the Colonial Office has in the case\r\n\r\nof  the Federation of Malaya, as well, considered it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  investigate the  sufficiency  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service after attainment of independence  for\r\n\r\nthe discharge of the normal duties of government.  I\r\n\r\nsay,  Sir,  that this did occur when the  Federation\r\n\r\nDelegation   went  to  England,  contrary   to   the\r\n\r\nassertion made by the Member for Tanjong Pagar,  and\r\n\r\nI  know  for  a  fact that it will occur  when  this\r\n\r\nDelegation  goes up to London: that the  issue  will\r\n\r\nhave to be considered and the Colonial Office will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseek  to be satisfied that after independence, there\r\n\r\nis, in this territory, an adequate civil service for\r\n\r\nthe normal needs of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the liberty of interrupting the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar when he said, \"Merdeka or no Merdeka,\r\n\r\nMalayanisation comes first\" because I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant to realise this: to us, at least to us  of\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front Coalition Government, Merdeka comes\r\n\r\nfirst.
