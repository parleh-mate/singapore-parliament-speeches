E. Lim (Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Sir, mobile number\r\n\r\nportability  refers  to the ability of  mobile  customers  to\r\n\r\nretain  their telephone number when they switch  between  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  mobile  operators.   IDA  mandated  mobile  number\r\n\r\nportability  since  the start of mobile  competition  on  1st\r\n\r\nApril 1997, when M1 entered the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several technical solutions can be used to achieve\r\n\r\nmobile  number portability.  In line with IDA's principle  of\r\n\r\ntechnology  neutrality,  IDA did  not  mandate  which  method\r\n\r\noperators  should  use.  Up until now, the implementation  of\r\n\r\nmobile number portability has been industry-driven.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDA recognises that the current mobile number\r\n\r\nportability  solution adopted by the mobile operators  has  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of limitations.  Specifically, SMS messages  are  not\r\n\r\nportable.  This means that a user cannot receive SMS messages\r\n\r\nsent  to  his original number once he switches to a different\r\n\r\nmobile  operator.  Given the high usage of SMS in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  the projected proliferation of mobile data services, the\r\n\r\nlack of SMS portability could become a significant barrier to\r\n\r\nmigration between mobile operators.  This would then  inhibit\r\n\r\nmobile competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limitation on SMS portability can be overcome.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this requires additional investments by the  mobile\r\n\r\noperators, and the end users could end up bearing the  higher\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the potential impact on both the mobile\r\n\r\noperators  and  customers, IDA has decided to re-convene  the\r\n\r\nMobile  Number Portability (MNP) Working Group  so  that  the\r\n\r\nmobile  operators  could engage in a discussion  of  all  the\r\n\r\nimplications   of  a  migration  to  a  full  mobile   number\r\n\r\nportability solution.  This would allow IDA to weigh the pros\r\n\r\nand  cons,  including the likely impact on consumers,  before\r\n\r\ndeciding  whether or not it is timely to mandate full  number\r\n\r\nportability.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, the Minister's\r\n\r\nreply  was  actually  referring to call  forwarding  and  SMS\r\n\r\nportability,  but  I am actually talking about  retention  of\r\n\r\ntelephone  numbers for mobile phone users.  So I  believe  he\r\n\r\nhas not answered the question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, call forwarding is a way to achieve\r\n\r\nnumber   portability.   In  other  words,  if  one   switches\r\n\r\noperators, yes, he will get a new telephone number.   But  if\r\n\r\nsomeone calls his old telephone number, he will still receive\r\n\r\nthe  call.  So, in that sense, his number has not changed  to\r\n\r\nthe people who are calling him, and that makes it portable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, we pay for the call forwarding,\r\n\r\nand  that  is the point I am trying to make.  Is the Minister\r\n\r\naware that in other countries, where MNP has been introduced,\r\n\r\nit has resulted in greater convenience for consumers?  It has\r\n\r\nalso resulted in cheaper telephone rates, and it has also not\r\n\r\naffected the profitability of telephone companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Yes, I am aware that a number of\r\n\r\ncountries  implement  a  full  network-based  mobile   number\r\n\r\nportability  system.  But this is a much  involved  technical\r\n\r\nsolution.  It does require setting up a database of  numbers,\r\n\r\nas  we are told, and it does require additional investment by\r\n\r\nthe  mobile  operators.  This will increase the cost  to  the\r\n\r\nmobile operators, and this cost must work, in some way,  into\r\n\r\nthe  system of charging users.  But, of course, the potential\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  this  is that it would make  competition  more\r\n\r\nviable in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  mobile  telephony industry, and therefore  this  is  the\r\n\r\nreason why we are taking another look at the issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no free lunch, so to speak.\r\n\r\nAt  the  end of the day, if we want the convenience  of  this\r\n\r\nservice,  if  we  want the convenience  of  keeping  our  own\r\n\r\ntelephone number, there is a solution to it.  But this is the\r\n\r\nsolution that is not costless, and therefore we will have  to\r\n\r\nweigh  carefully the pros and cons of whether or  not  it  is\r\n\r\nadvantageous  to introduce this.  Right now, those  who  want\r\n\r\nnumber portability pay for the service, and they pay a charge\r\n\r\nof  several  dollars  a month, and they get  the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nnumber  portability.   But  if we  implement  a  network-wide\r\n\r\nsolution,  then  all users will have to pay  for  the  higher\r\n\r\ncost,  whether or not they change the telephone numbers.   So\r\n\r\nthere are pros and cons, and this is what we will weigh out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, am I right in saying that in\r\n\r\nimplementing  a full MNP system in Singapore, it  would  cost\r\n\r\nabout $100 million which, in the larger context of things, is\r\n\r\nreally  not  very expensive?  On the point of paying  charges\r\n\r\nfor  full MNP, is the Minister aware that, in Hong Kong,  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of MNP resulted in a 60% drop  in  tariffs,  as\r\n\r\noperators  braced themselves for the change and  they  became\r\n\r\nmore  competitive?   Actually,  in  the  end,  the  consumers\r\n\r\nbenefited.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, tariffs will change in response to\r\n\r\ncompetition  in the marketplace.  I am not sure  exactly,  in\r\n\r\nthe case of Hong Kong, whether it changed only because of MNP\r\n\r\nimplementation.  But, certainly, to the extent that you  have\r\n\r\ngot  competition in the marketplace, competition  will  drive\r\n\r\nrates  to competitive levels.  And this is what we intend  to\r\n\r\ndo  in  the  Singapore marketplace, which is to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  competition in the marketplace, and we  have  that\r\n\r\ntoday.  This is why, as I said yesterday in this House,  that\r\n\r\nwe   have   a  very  high  level  of  mobile  usage,   mobile\r\n\r\npenetration.   That  shows that the existing  model  has  not\r\n\r\nhindered the growth of the marketplace.  Nonetheless, we will\r\n\r\nlook  at the matter.

Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Sir, before I take Members\r\n\r\nthrough  some of the initiatives that the Ministry is putting\r\n\r\nin  place  to  help  Singaporean  families  with  care-giving\r\n\r\nresponsibilities,  let me answer some specific  questions  on\r\n\r\nthe family that were raised yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki asked if MCDS has a \"family policy\". We have\r\n\r\nwidely-known  principles  that  undergird  all   our   social\r\n\r\npolicies.   May I take this opportunity to remind  Dr  Maliki\r\n\r\nthat these are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, family is the building block of society. Family\r\n\r\nties  are the key factors in rooting Singaporeans.  They  are\r\n\r\nthe ties that bind us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, family is the first line of care and support. This\r\n\r\nprinciple is applied even in the implementation of our social\r\n\r\nsafety  net.  So, whenever an applicant comes in through  the\r\n\r\nCDC,  we will check his family background to ensure the level\r\n\r\nof  support  that he has.  So, family, as the first  line  of\r\n\r\nsupport, is a very important consideration in everything that\r\n\r\nwe do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, strong and stable families are critical for the\r\n\r\nwell-being  of individuals, and for our nation.  If  families\r\n\r\nare weak, they will undermine the first two principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family, as a building block of our society, is an\r\n\r\nimportant  principle for us in Singapore.  But we  know  that\r\n\r\nfamily  is a personal domain, and we respect that.   But  the\r\n\r\nhealth of society rests on the health of the family.  This is\r\n\r\nsomething that we should not forget.  Thus, the role  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is to provide the support, the infrastructure,  to\r\n\r\nenable  the family to fulfill its roles and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nI suppose we should support this, and not supplant it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki also asked about the role of fathers and\r\n\r\nhusbands  - a very interesting topic.  There is the emotional\r\n\r\ntug-of-war  between a father who feels he is doing everything\r\n\r\nand  earning an income, and a homemaker, or a working mother,\r\n\r\nwho  is  exhausted and frustrated, because she is not getting\r\n\r\nthe support and involvement from her spouse.  Couples need to\r\n\r\nexamine not only how much time each parent spends with  their\r\n\r\nchildren,  but  also  the type of activities  that  they  are\r\n\r\nengaged in.  While it is much easier for mothers, because  of\r\n\r\nthe way a mother's role has been socially conditioned, it  is\r\n\r\nunfortunately  less straightforward for fathers.   But  I  am\r\n\r\npleased to note that, increasingly, fathers too want to enjoy\r\n\r\nthe  joys of parenthood or fatherhood.  Judging from the good\r\n\r\nresponse the Centre for Fathering has been receiving, fathers\r\n\r\nwant a role to play in the family too.  More recently, I have\r\n\r\nbeen  told  by  some mothers that the way to  encourage  good\r\n\r\nfathering  is  for  mothers to withdraw from  some  areas  of\r\n\r\nactivities, in order to provide some opportunity for  fathers\r\n\r\nto be good fathers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to congratulate my parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Dr  Maliki, for having taken the first  steps  to\r\n\r\nstart  Forum  Adam last year, a seminar aimed  at  empowering\r\n\r\nMalay  men  to embrace a fair-share of parenting.  The  event\r\n\r\nattracted  the highest number of 300 Malay men attending  any\r\n\r\nFamily  Life  Education Conference.  Today,  the  publication\r\n\r\nVisi  Adam  serves  to empower many Malay  fathers  on  their\r\n\r\nfathering skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having fathers who are equally involved as mothers in\r\n\r\nthe parenting partnership is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na fundamental tenet on what it means to be a family.  Sir, my\r\n\r\nMinistry  promotes this underlying principle in  the  various\r\n\r\neducation programmes conducted by our community partners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng asked whether the civil service would extend\r\n\r\nthe  5-day  unrecorded paid leave for looking  after  a  sick\r\n\r\nchild  to  fathers as well.  MCDS will work with  the  Public\r\n\r\nService Division to review this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Mdm Halimah asked about the implementation of\r\n\r\nfamily  care  leave.   Again,  MCDS  cannot  implement   this\r\n\r\nunilaterally.   We  will have to consult the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nDivision for the civil service, and the Working Committee  on\r\n\r\nWork-Life, comprising officials from MCDS, NTUC, MOM and SNEF\r\n\r\nand,  of  course,  Mdm  Halimah  who  is  a  member  of  this\r\n\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have discussed, so far, some of the programmes\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  embarked  and  will  be  embarking  upon   to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  family.  Let me now turn  to  the  range  of\r\n\r\nservices and care options that my Ministry will implement  in\r\n\r\norder  to help Singapore families stay strong.  We know  that\r\n\r\nwith the trend towards nuclear families, smaller families and\r\n\r\ndual-income   households,   families   will   require    more\r\n\r\nassistance,  especially in the area  of  childcare.   I  will\r\n\r\ndescribe  what are the things that my Ministry  is  doing  to\r\n\r\nincrease  some  of the care options and improved  access  for\r\n\r\nchildcare for families in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are committed to increasing the range of the\r\n\r\nchildcare options to help parents to fulfill their role.  For\r\n\r\na  start, we have launched the Baby Bonus Scheme as a way  to\r\n\r\nhelp  parents to meet the financial needs of their  children,\r\n\r\nespecially when they are young.  But parents do require  more\r\n\r\noptions in terms of childcare so that they will help them  to\r\n\r\nbalance   their   work   and  their  life.    Flexible   work\r\n\r\narrangements and part-time work for parents are becoming more\r\n\r\nprevalent  these days, and this is because of  the  increased\r\n\r\nawareness among both families and businesses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout family-work practices.  More couples, especially women,\r\n\r\nare  also  working part-time during the early years of  their\r\n\r\nchildren's development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of this, on top of the current subsidies\r\n\r\nfor  full-day and half-day childcare programmes which we have\r\n\r\ngiven  to  families, my Ministry will now grant  a  pro-rated\r\n\r\nchildcare subsidy to both working and non-working mothers for\r\n\r\nflexible  childcare programmes in licensed childcare centres.\r\n\r\nUnder  this  flexible  childcare  scheme,  parents  will   be\r\n\r\neligible  for a pro-rated childcare subsidy when  they  place\r\n\r\ntheir  children in a childcare centre that offers  programmes\r\n\r\nfor  a minimum of two half-days every week.  This scheme will\r\n\r\nbe  implemented in January next year, and my Ministry has set\r\n\r\naside $5 million for this financial year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong and Dr Lily Neo have asked for more\r\n\r\nhelp  for  parents  with young infants, especially  below  18\r\n\r\nmonths.  As Members will know, childcare operators can  offer\r\n\r\ninfant care services for children as young as two months old,\r\n\r\nprovided  of  course  they comply with certain  requirements,\r\n\r\nboth  physical  and staffing, because these  are  very  young\r\n\r\nchildren.   Therefore, we need a certain type of skills  set.\r\n\r\nSuch  requirements, as we know, are critical because  of  the\r\n\r\nsafety  and  well-being  of our young  children.   Currently,\r\n\r\nthere  are eight centres providing infant care services  but,\r\n\r\nat the end of the day, we will have to allow market forces to\r\n\r\ndictate the supply and demand for infant care services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also asked whether higher subsidies could be\r\n\r\nprovided  for infant care.  Besides the childcare subsidy  of\r\n\r\n$150   and   $75   for   working  and   non-working   parents\r\n\r\nrespectively, there are two other subsidy schemes that can be\r\n\r\nused for fees at infant care services.  First, of course,  is\r\n\r\nthe  Baby Bonus Scheme, which provides cash payment  for  six\r\n\r\nyears  -  $500 per year for the second child, and $1,000  per\r\n\r\nyear  for  the third child.  The Government also matches  the\r\n\r\nparents'  contribution, so it is a co-payment scheme,  dollar\r\n\r\nfor  dollar, up to a maximum of $1,000 for the second  child,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$2,000 for the third child.  This works out to be about  $125\r\n\r\nand   $250   per  month  for  the  second  and  third   child\r\n\r\nrespectively, and these can be used to pay fees at the infant\r\n\r\ncare   centres.   The  second  scheme  is  what  I  mentioned\r\n\r\nyesterday.  The Centre-Based Financial Assistance Scheme  for\r\n\r\nChildcare   (CFAC)  is  available  for  low-income  families.\r\n\r\nTogether, these subsidies can help families cope with  infant\r\n\r\ncare fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while affordability is an issue, it is equally\r\n\r\nimportant  that  parents are provided with childcare  options\r\n\r\nother  than centre-based options.  As Ms Irene Ng has pointed\r\n\r\nout, studies have shown that home care, especially by one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  of  the  parents, by a mother or father, or a consistent\r\n\r\ncaregiver, is far superior to a centre-based option.  Infants\r\n\r\nare  better  cared  in a family setting  where  they  receive\r\n\r\nindividualised  care.  I am, therefore, pleased  to  announce\r\n\r\nthat my Ministry is piloting the Family Day Care Service as a\r\n\r\ncare  option, especially for infants and toddlers who require\r\n\r\ngreater  individual care and attention.  The Family Day  Care\r\n\r\nScheme  provides  home-based care  for  children  by  trained\r\n\r\ncaregivers, who are mainly housewives and retirees.  It  will\r\n\r\nprovide  a flexible care arrangement that will allow  parents\r\n\r\nto work and to work out mutually acceptable arrangements with\r\n\r\nthe caregiver.  So it is an arrangement whereby they can work\r\n\r\ntogether with the caregiver.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this scheme, which we are piloting now with both\r\n\r\nthe  Southeast and Southwest CDCs, the councils will help  us\r\n\r\nto recruit and maintain a list of caregivers who can care for\r\n\r\nchildren in their homes.  The councils will also support them\r\n\r\nwith  information  and  training.  After  the  training,  the\r\n\r\nservice  refers and matches the caregivers with  the  parents\r\n\r\nwho  have  no  full-time  care for their  children.   We  are\r\n\r\nputting  aside  $150,000 this year for this  initiative.   So\r\n\r\nfar,  from  what we have heard from the two CDCs,  they  have\r\n\r\nreceived  many  enquiries about this scheme, and  the  actual\r\n\r\nmatching and referrals are expected to pick up soon.  The two\r\n\r\nCDCs  will  also maintain a list of short-term  or  temporary\r\n\r\ncaregivers to provide parents with occasional care  services.\r\n\r\nSome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparents may not need such a service on a frequent basis,  but\r\n\r\nthey may need such service because they have to go out and do\r\n\r\nsomething else and, therefore, they can rely upon this list.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Charles Chong and Dr Lily Neo also asked for\r\n\r\nmore  childcare  centres.   At  the  moment,  there  are  608\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres  operating  in  Singapore  offering  about\r\n\r\n50,400  places, and the take-up rate is only about  76%.   So\r\n\r\nthere  is  still  extra capacity.  Since  the  delegation  of\r\n\r\nchildcare  development  to  CDCs,  the  CDCs  have  played  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  role in identifying sites for childcare  centres\r\n\r\nthat  are  both convenient to parents and, at the same  time,\r\n\r\nmeeting  the  local  needs.  This year, we  plan  to  develop\r\n\r\nanother  60  childcare centres, which will give an additional\r\n\r\n3,700 places for children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong also asked for better training for\r\n\r\nchildcare  teachers.   I am pleased to  inform  Members  that\r\n\r\nsince 1985, MCDS has had a training system to ensure a steady\r\n\r\nsupply of trained childcare personnel.  The quality and level\r\n\r\nof their training have a direct impact on the quality of care\r\n\r\nprovided   by   our  centres.   We  stipulate  the   training\r\n\r\nrequirements currently, and all centre supervisors  have  the\r\n\r\nrequired    Certificate   in   Pre-School   Management    and\r\n\r\nAdministration.   In addition, 65% of all childcare  teachers\r\n\r\npossess  the Certificate in Pre-School Training.  Last  year,\r\n\r\nwe   took  the  process  one  step  further.   MCDS  and  MOE\r\n\r\nestablished  a  joint training framework for  all  pre-school\r\n\r\npersonnel, and a joint pre-school qualification accreditation\r\n\r\ncommittee was formed to set training guidelines and  accredit\r\n\r\npre-school teacher training courses.  To further enhance  the\r\n\r\nprofessionalism  and the quality of childcare  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nMCDS   announced  in  1999  new  training  requirements   for\r\n\r\nchildcare centre personnel.  All centre supervisors,  and  at\r\n\r\nleast one teacher per centre, must possess a Diploma in  Pre-School Education by the end of 2004, and all teachers must be\r\n\r\ntrained  at  the Certificate in Pre-School Teaching  by  this\r\n\r\ndate.  Based on the projected number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraining  places provided by 15 training agencies that  offer\r\n\r\naccredited  training  courses, there are sufficient  training\r\n\r\nplaces to meet this current demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides providing more childcare options, my Ministry is\r\n\r\nalso  committed  to improving the quality of  childcare.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry,  with the help of partners, such as the Association\r\n\r\nof Early Childhood Educators (Singapore) (AECES) will also be\r\n\r\nimplementing training programmes for informal caregivers  for\r\n\r\nchildren, such as maids or relatives.  Short courses will  be\r\n\r\noffered   in  different  languages  which  will   equip   the\r\n\r\ncaregivers  with  basic  skills  of  caring  for  our   young\r\n\r\nchildren.   They  will  impart knowledge  on  physical  care,\r\n\r\nhygiene,  first-aid and, of course, child  development.   The\r\n\r\ncourse will be launched by the end of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides helping families in childcare, sometimes\r\n\r\nfamilies  have other concerns requiring temporary assistance.\r\n\r\nMdm  Cynthia  Phua  has  raised some  concerns  about  making\r\n\r\naccessibility  better for families.  She has  also  suggested\r\n\r\nthe  setting  up of one-stop support centres to provide  such\r\n\r\nfrontline   service  for  the  families.    Currently,   this\r\n\r\nfrontline  function is undertaken by Family  Service  Centres\r\n\r\n(FSCs).   Members  of the public who need  advice  on  family\r\n\r\nmatters and they are not sure whom to contact, they can  call\r\n\r\nthe  FSC helpline at the toll-free number 1800-8380100.  This\r\n\r\nis  a  first-stop telephone hotline for families.  Once  they\r\n\r\nmake  the  call, it will be directed to the FSC  serving  the\r\n\r\narea where the resident is living in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FSCs, as we know, are the first-stop neighbourhood-based\r\n\r\nfocal  point providing social services to families  and  they\r\n\r\nmanage  four  core  programmes -  casework  and  counselling,\r\n\r\ninformation  and  referral, family education,  and  outreach.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  if  a family approaches an FSC  for  financial\r\n\r\nassistance,  they  will  be  counselled  and,  if  necessary,\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the nearest CDC which administers  the  various\r\n\r\nschemes.   FSCs  also have the expertise to  deal  with  most\r\n\r\nfamily  problems, but if specialised expertise or  assistance\r\n\r\nis needed, they will work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclosely  with CDCs and other organisations.  So, coordination\r\n\r\nand   networking  among  the  social  service  providers  are\r\n\r\nimportant  steps to ensure that families get  the  help  that\r\n\r\nthey need, timely and effectively.  At the moment, there  are\r\n\r\nabout  35 FSCs operating in Singapore.  One more FSC will  be\r\n\r\nestablished next year in Chua Chu Kang, and each FSC serves a\r\n\r\npopulation  of  between  80,000 and 160,000  residents.   And\r\n\r\nbased  upon what we have seen, this is adequate to  meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds of our family and our community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these initiatives and programmes relating to\r\n\r\nthe  family  that  I  have mentioned, must  only  be  matched\r\n\r\nrightly by a change in mindset about care-giving roles within\r\n\r\nthe  family.  We cannot but stress the impact of the couples'\r\n\r\nmarital  health  on family well-being.  In the  first  place,\r\n\r\nfull  and  equal  partnership in a marriage  can  help  share\r\n\r\nstress and offer mutual support and this, of course, in  turn\r\n\r\ncontributes to work-life balance.  Furthermore, children  are\r\n\r\naffected  by  their  parents'  relationship  to  each  other.\r\n\r\nLoving,  cooperative 2-parent families are clearly  the  best\r\n\r\nenvironment for today's children to be raised.  Both sets  of\r\n\r\nparents,  therefore,  need  to share  the  care-giving  role.\r\n\r\nFather care is as important as mother care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can now turn to the subject on the elderly, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank  all the MPs who have spoken  on  the  issues\r\n\r\npertaining to our seniors.  Mr Charles Chong, Chairman of the\r\n\r\nGPC for Community Development and Sports, has asked about the\r\n\r\nprogress  of  the work of the Inter-Ministerial Committee  on\r\n\r\nthe  Aging Population.  I am pleased to inform the House that\r\n\r\nthe  work  of the Committee is bearing fruit.  To date,  over\r\n\r\n80% of the recommendations have been or being implemented.  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  are  quite familiar with some of them.   The  more\r\n\r\nrecent  developments include, of course, the  Lift  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme,  the  Five-year Eldercare Master  Plan  which  was\r\n\r\nlaunched  last  year, the Severe Disability Insurance  Scheme\r\n\r\nand, of course, the provision for barrier-free access in  all\r\n\r\nour MRT and LRT stations.  The infrastructure is being put in\r\n\r\nplace to prepare for an aging population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are a few outstanding recommendations that are\r\n\r\nstill  being studied, and these pertain primarily to  changes\r\n\r\nto  the  Central Provident Fund and the implementation  of  a\r\n\r\nportable medical benefits system.  All these recommendations,\r\n\r\nas   Members  will  agree,  have  a  tremendous   impact   on\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Therefore, we should take a prudent  approach\r\n\r\nin  implementing  some of these recommendations.   Hence,  we\r\n\r\nshould study them thoroughly before coming to a decision.  Mr\r\n\r\nCharles  Chong is probably aware that the CPF issues and  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  portable medical benefits are  currently  being\r\n\r\nstudied by the Economic Review Committee (ERC).  And  as  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee, Mr Mah Bow  Tan,\r\n\r\nwill be releasing a more detailed progress report on the work\r\n\r\nof the IMC soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I can turn to the issue of social integration,\r\n\r\nMs  Irene  Ng spoke passionately yesterday about making  sure\r\n\r\nthat  there is a place for the elderly, and not for us to  be\r\n\r\noverly  focusing  on the young.  I think we need  a  balance.\r\n\r\nSocial integration and active aging are the corner-stones  of\r\n\r\nour national effort to achieve successful aging in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe want to achieve this with three strategies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, of course, promoting positive mindsets and\r\n\r\nattitudes  towards aging and older people.  Second,  creating\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  stretch the productive  potential  of  our\r\n\r\nseniors  and tap their wealth of experience, particularly  in\r\n\r\nways  in which we can promote inter-generational contact  and\r\n\r\nbonding.   Finally, as Mr Charles Chong has  rightly  pointed\r\n\r\nout,  strengthening our community-based services  to  support\r\n\r\nfamilies  in caring for their frail elderly members in  their\r\n\r\nown homes.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate on these three strategies. One key\r\n\r\nsuccess factor, of course, is society's mindset, and Dr  Lily\r\n\r\nNeo has rightly raised that as a challenge for us to discuss.\r\n\r\nWe  have already taken a systematic approach to have a public\r\n\r\neducation programme year round, in order to promote  positive\r\n\r\nattitudes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntowards  aging  and  older people.  Our  target  audience  is\r\n\r\nacross all sectors, including the elderly.  We have and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  collaborate with various  Government  and  non-Governmental   organisations  to  promote   positive   public\r\n\r\nattitudes  through  public  and professional  forums,  talks,\r\n\r\nmedia campaigns and production of resource materials on aging\r\n\r\nissues.   We also have the annual Senior Citizens'  Week  and\r\n\r\nGrandparents'  Day  as  forums to promote  active  aging  and\r\n\r\nrespect  for  our  seniors.   But  Members  will  agree  that\r\n\r\nchanging  mindsets will take time, and it  will  require  the\r\n\r\ncollective  effort of everyone in our society, including  the\r\n\r\nelderly.  To this end, I am glad to learn that many community\r\n\r\norganisations  are taking the lead to promote positive  aging\r\n\r\nand  senior volunteerism.  For example, in last year's Senior\r\n\r\nCitizens'  Week,  more  than  40  community  clubs  organised\r\n\r\nprogrammes and activities for the elderly and their families.\r\n\r\nThe  Central  Singapore CDC, which I was  closely  associated\r\n\r\nwith, has launched a programme to rope in elderly volunteers,\r\n\r\nwho  then  read  to  primary school children  every  week,  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  called  Read  and Reach  Programme.   The  Retired\r\n\r\nSeniors  Volunteer  Programme  (RSVP)  conducts  a  mentoring\r\n\r\nprogramme  for  school  children.  Last  year,  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation Senior Citizens' Network launched the SPICES  for\r\n\r\nLife Programme.  This programme is designed to motivate older\r\n\r\npeople  to learn to pick up new skills, such as IT.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthat we could see more of such community organisations coming\r\n\r\nforward to help us spread the message.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must recognise that in the life cycle, at different\r\n\r\ntimes,  at different points in our lives, our needs  will  be\r\n\r\ndifferent  and  therefore,  we  need  to  prepare  for  them.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my Ministry will intensify all our efforts to work\r\n\r\ntogether  with  other agencies to promote  what  we  call,  a\r\n\r\nculture of planning for the various transitions in our  life,\r\n\r\nincluding aging or the so called \"third age\".  The key, as Mr\r\n\r\nMaidin has rightly pointed out, is to start early.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second thrust, both Mr Maidin and Mr Zainul\r\n\r\nhave spoken about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiving  our seniors productive and meaningful roles to  play.\r\n\r\nOver the next 4-5 years, MCDS will place greater emphasis  on\r\n\r\nprogrammes to develop the potential of our seniors.  We  have\r\n\r\nlaunched  the Active Seniors Programme. We have set aside  $5\r\n\r\nmillion for this programme over the next four years to  pilot\r\n\r\ninnovative  projects  designed to tap  the  talents  and  the\r\n\r\nexperience  of  older Singaporeans for  the  benefit  of  our\r\n\r\ncommunity.  I am pleased to inform the House that  the  first\r\n\r\nsix projects are currently being implemented.  We welcome any\r\n\r\nother  proposals from anyone or any community  organisations.\r\n\r\nThese projects will involve over 2,000 senior volunteers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has asked specifically if senior volunteers\r\n\r\ncan  be reimbursed for incidental expenses, such as transport\r\n\r\nand  what  have  you.  Some of the VWOs, for  example,  RSVP,\r\n\r\nSingapore   Action   Group  of  Elders   (SAGE)   and   Lions\r\n\r\nBefrienders, are already doing so and we will promote this as\r\n\r\na best practice for others to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul and Ms Irene Ng also raised issues about\r\n\r\ngrandparenting   and  the  need  to  foster  greater   inter-generational interaction.  Besides community involvement, our\r\n\r\nelderly  can continue to play a valuable role in the  family,\r\n\r\nby promoting family value and transmitting positive values to\r\n\r\ntheir grandchildren. The role of grandparents will evolve  in\r\n\r\ntandem  with  our more educated elderly population.   Towards\r\n\r\nthis  end, MCDS supports public education programmes  related\r\n\r\nto grandparenting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng will also be happy to learn that we are also\r\n\r\ndeveloping more facilities that will bring the young and  old\r\n\r\ntogether.   The  Neighbourhood Link  is  one  such  facility,\r\n\r\nlocated  in studio apartments and HDB void decks.   The  Link\r\n\r\nmobilises  volunteers  of  all  age  groups  to  help   needy\r\n\r\nresidents in the community.  I visited one in Toa Payoh, well-located, not too far from the town centre, and they have lots\r\n\r\nof  activities  for the senior citizens to engage  themselves\r\n\r\nin. With the help of the VWOs, we can continue to engage them\r\n\r\nin other types of activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The co-location or close location of services for\r\n\r\ndifferent  age  groups also promotes social  integration,  as\r\n\r\ndoes joint programming.  The Tampines 3 in 1 Family Centre is\r\n\r\nan  example of co-location of services for the young and  the\r\n\r\nold  under  one  roof.  Children from the  student  care  and\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres are brought to the eldercare centre  daily\r\n\r\nfor  them to mingle with the seniors.  Another example is our\r\n\r\nSingapore  Boys' Home located in Jurong, next  to  the  Saint\r\n\r\nJoseph's  Home.  This proximity allows our boys to  help  out\r\n\r\nregularly  at  the  home and befriend the  elderly  residents\r\n\r\nthere.   The  experience has been a mutually beneficial  one.\r\n\r\nThe   elderly  are  able  to  share  with  the  young   their\r\n\r\nexperiences, the history of Singapore and, in some instances,\r\n\r\nwe found that they act as mentors to the boys.  And the boys,\r\n\r\nin turn, bring companionship to the old.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul also asked whether we have studied the\r\n\r\nexperiences  of  other  countries  with  regard   to   inter-generational  programming.  Sir,  we  have  visited   several\r\n\r\ncountries, including Japan and Hong Kong, which face  similar\r\n\r\nageing  challenges  as we do.  We will be visiting  Australia\r\n\r\nand  the  United  Kingdom  to learn  not  just  about  inter-generational  issues,  but also about aged  care  and  policy\r\n\r\nmeasures.   Where  feasible, we  will  adopt  some  of  these\r\n\r\nlearning  points. We have to adapt them to the local  context\r\n\r\nand perhaps also expand on our range of programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now onto care for the aged. Mr Charles Chong also\r\n\r\nhighlighted  the impact the ageing society will have  on  the\r\n\r\ncare-giving   role.    Currently,  our  range  of   eldercare\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  services and facilities are run by close  to  70\r\n\r\nvoluntary  welfare organisations.  Over the next four  years,\r\n\r\nwe  will step up these services to better support families in\r\n\r\nthe  care  for  the  elderly at home.  The initiatives  being\r\n\r\nplanned for include 400 additional day care places, more home\r\n\r\nhelp  services,  gerontological counselling, case  management\r\n\r\nand a wide range of respite care services.  In planning these\r\n\r\nservices,  my Ministry will work closely with the  respective\r\n\r\nCDCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to meet the rising demand, not only for a wider\r\n\r\nrange, but for a higher quality of services, I think we  need\r\n\r\nto  bring  new  players  into the  field  of  community-based\r\n\r\nservices.   This will, of course, inject fresh ideas  on  how\r\n\r\nservices can better meet changing demands, and be more  cost-effective in meeting these demands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting this July, my Ministry will introduce a new\r\n\r\nincentive framework to encourage more cooperatives to provide\r\n\r\neldercare  programmes for seniors in the community, beginning\r\n\r\nwith   day  care  and  home  help  services.   The  incentive\r\n\r\nframework will have two elements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the extension of Government subsidy to\r\n\r\ncooperatives   that  run  these  services.   Second,   making\r\n\r\nsubsidised premises available to cooperatives to set  up  and\r\n\r\nrun the services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next 2-3 years, MCDS will also implement\r\n\r\nfurther measures to encourage private operators to enter  the\r\n\r\neldercare field.  One key initiative is a user-subsidy system\r\n\r\nin  which  an  elderly Singaporean, who meets the eligibility\r\n\r\ncriteria, will receive a subsidy, regardless of which service\r\n\r\nprovider  he  goes  to.   So there is  portability.   Another\r\n\r\ninitiative  is  to set aside 10-20% of the premises  reserved\r\n\r\nfor  eldercare services for commercial operators to bid  over\r\n\r\nthe next five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is also constantly reviewing our subsidy\r\n\r\npolicy   to   ensure  that  services  remain  affordable   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Last year, we introduced differential  subsidy\r\n\r\nrates  for  elderly  services such that  lower  income  users\r\n\r\nreceive a higher level of subsidy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS has recently reviewed the eligibility criteria and\r\n\r\nI  am  pleased to announce that we will be raising the income\r\n\r\nceiling for the 50% subsidy from $500 to $700.  This revision\r\n\r\nwill  potentially  benefit our seniors who  are  in  the  per\r\n\r\ncapita  family income  range of $500-$700 and  who  need  day\r\n\r\ncare services or sheltered accommodation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will address the specific suggestion of Mr\r\n\r\nAng Mong Seng to set up a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity  senior  citizens' institute.   I  agree  that  our\r\n\r\ncommunity facilities should also cater to the needs of  older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Currently, there is already an infrastructure\r\n\r\nin place to organise various activities for our seniors.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  as  Members know, they can sign up for  courses  in\r\n\r\ncommunity   clubs,   participate  in   sports,   social   and\r\n\r\nrecreational  activities organised by  our  Senior  Citizens'\r\n\r\nClubs.  Today, there are 112 Senior Citizens' Clubs or groups\r\n\r\nin  the  Southwest CDC alone.  Among them,  73  have  set  up\r\n\r\nmutual  care  and  support groups among their  members.   For\r\n\r\nthose who need a job, they can approach the CDC concerned for\r\n\r\nassistance.  I am happy to inform Mr Ang that my Ministry  is\r\n\r\nnow  working  with Southwest CDC to set up two  Neighbourhood\r\n\r\nLinks at Jurong East and Chua Chu Kang respectively.  Instead\r\n\r\nof  building a new facility, we would like to suggest that Mr\r\n\r\nAng  may  want to work with the CDC first to see how best  we\r\n\r\ncan  leverage  on the existing infrastructure and  facilities\r\n\r\nand  the  two neighbourhood links that we are proposing  with\r\n\r\nSouthwest   CDC,  so  that  we  can  better  coordinate   the\r\n\r\nprogrammes and services to meet the needs of our elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed most of the concerns\r\n\r\nraised yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, can I make a point of\r\n\r\nclarification?  The FSC has the undertone of  the  VWOs.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  rich  Family Service Centre  in  Bishan  is  a\r\n\r\nChristian  organisation.  I know that some  families  do  not\r\n\r\nwant to go there.  That is the reason why I asked for the CDC\r\n\r\nto  be  the front-line office for such family service support\r\n\r\ncentres  and,  at  the same time, they can  also  handle  the\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I do not necessarily\r\n\r\ndisagree  with the Member that the CDC can play  that  value-added  role.  In terms of FSCs where there are such barriers,\r\n\r\nit  is  better  for us to work with the FSCs to  lower  those\r\n\r\nbarriers  so  that  people of different faiths  or  different\r\n\r\nraces will feel comfortable.  In fact, our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexperiences have shown that in some other FSCs, such  as  the\r\n\r\nMarine Parade FSC, the number of Malay clients there has been\r\n\r\nincreasing in the last few years. There are ways in which  we\r\n\r\ncan  lower the barriers to make FSCs more effective, in terms\r\n\r\nof  reaching out to a wider clientele. Certainly, if the CDCs\r\n\r\nare  prepared  to  take that role, I am sure  we  could  work\r\n\r\ntogether with the CDCs, so that they could play the role of a\r\n\r\nfront-line  office.  I think this is best left to the  Mayors\r\n\r\nto consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  in  January this year, announced that Inter-Racial\r\n\r\nConfidence  Circles (IRCCs) will be formed to  foster  inter-racial   and  inter-religious  rapport  among  the  different\r\n\r\ncommunities through regular interactions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The descriptions and objectives of the IRCCs resemble\r\n\r\nthat  of goodwill communities that were formed shortly  after\r\n\r\nthe  racial  riots  in   Singapore during  the  1960s.  These\r\n\r\ncommunities  were eventually replaced by the CCCs  and  other\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations.  IRCCs are now being formed  as  an\r\n\r\nextension of the CCCs.  Have we come a full circle?   In  the\r\n\r\n1960s,  there  were  numerous  kampongs  and  villages   were\r\n\r\ninformal but acknowledged leadership, in the form of  village\r\n\r\nheadmen or penghulus, had evolved over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, times have changed. Our housing and\r\n\r\nresettlement policies, although assuring better  ethnic  mix,\r\n\r\nhave  broken  up the informal but influential  leadership  as\r\n\r\npenghulus   and   their   flocks   were   dispersed   through\r\n\r\nresettlement   throughout  the  island  and  these   kampongs\r\n\r\nvanished.  It is now harder to find acknowledged penghulus or\r\n\r\nvillage  headmen in our new HDB estates, but we should  still\r\n\r\ntry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRCCs are likely to see greater success in fostering\r\n\r\ninter-religious rapport as religious leadership  in  mosques,\r\n\r\ntemples  and churches are still quite clearly defined.  Could\r\n\r\nthe Minister give us an update on the formation of the IRCCs,\r\n\r\nand  how successful have IRCCs been in inducting acknowledged\r\n\r\ncommunity leaders who are not already serving in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations?  Are IRCCs, that have already  been\r\n\r\nformed, clear on their composition, objectives and methods on\r\n\r\nhow they should go about achieving the desired outcomes?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Chairman, it\r\n\r\nhas been more than 40 years that the People's Association has\r\n\r\nbeen involved in the development of community work.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  involvement of Malay activists in the PA  activities  is\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory.  This does not mean that the  involvement  of\r\n\r\nMalays  in  community activities in general is reducing.   It\r\n\r\ncan be said very accurately that many Malays are involved  in\r\n\r\ncommunity  activities  but only with organisations  that  are\r\n\r\nrelated to the mosques and Malay/Muslim bodies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay community does enjoy social interaction and is\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  the  problems of  others.   I  believe  that\r\n\r\nincreasing   the  involvement  of  the  Malay  community   in\r\n\r\ngrassroots activities, such as the RCs, CCCs, is one way  for\r\n\r\nus   to   strengthen   inter-community   relations   at   the\r\n\r\nconstituency level. The Malay community's involvement in  the\r\n\r\nactivities of the People's Association is important and  must\r\n\r\nbe encouraged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the question is: why is the involvement of\r\n\r\nthe Malays in the People's Association activities so lacking?\r\n\r\nWhat  measures  can  be taken to enhance  their  involvement?\r\n\r\nMaybe  the  People's Association needs to use  more  suitable\r\n\r\nstrategies  and  approach  and it should  take  into  account\r\n\r\nefforts to attract more Malay activists.  One group we should\r\n\r\nbe  concerned about in our efforts to enhance the involvement\r\n\r\nof  the  Malays in the People's Association's activities,  is\r\n\r\nthe young or the youths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, not long ago, the People's Association had\r\n\r\ncarried out a study to identify the interest and needs of the\r\n\r\nMalay community in terms of community activities.

Secondly,  based\r\n\r\non the study, what measures have been taken to enhance the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvolvement   of   the  Malay  community  in   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation's activities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Prime Minister's Goh\r\n\r\ninitiative of forming the IRCCs has sparked off a  number  of\r\n\r\ncultural  and  bonding programmes, aimed  at  bringing  about\r\n\r\ncultural and religious appreciation and understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether enough\r\n\r\nmeasures have been taken to prepare our community leaders and\r\n\r\ncommunity  to cope with the events of a terrorist  attack  or\r\n\r\nriot  in Singapore.  I am well aware that our security forces\r\n\r\nand  civil defence force are fully prepared to deal with such\r\n\r\nexigencies.  Nonetheless, are our ordinary folks prepared  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with such an occurrence - God forbid - or a terror were\r\n\r\nto  transpire?  Could we have a regular television and  radio\r\n\r\nprogramme to educate our ordinary folks, especially  the  old\r\n\r\nand  the young, on what they ought to do, and how they  ought\r\n\r\nto  react,  if  such  a situation were to  take  place?   For\r\n\r\nexample,  would  the  Minister  consider  putting  out   some\r\n\r\nprogrammes  on  how the community leaders and  community  can\r\n\r\nmanage their emotions in a very tense-filled atmosphere  that\r\n\r\nis normally an aftermath after such an event?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main point that I would like to raise here is\r\n\r\nthat our community leaders and community need to be aware of,\r\n\r\nand knowledgeable about, how to respond during any emergency.\r\n\r\nThey  cannot completely depend upon the efforts of our  civil\r\n\r\ndefence  officers to tell them what to do during such  times.\r\n\r\nIn  this  connection, what types of programmes are in  place,\r\n\r\nand are there sufficient funds earmarked for these programmes\r\n\r\nto  raise  the awareness level of our community  leaders  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  so  that  they will know how to  respond?   In  my\r\n\r\nopinion, some crisis management education programme  must  be\r\n\r\nin place so that our community leaders and the community will\r\n\r\nknow  how  to react to these crises.  Such crisis  management\r\n\r\nprogrammes are also required in schools and at the workplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, Singapore's rate of\r\n\r\nvolunteerism,  when  compared  to  the  developed  countries,\r\n\r\nappears to be rather dismal.  The National Volunteers  Centre\r\n\r\nwas  formed in July 1999, as a joint initiative of  MCDS  and\r\n\r\nthe people sector.  Its mission is to promote volunteerism as\r\n\r\na  way  of life across all sectors and all levels of society.\r\n\r\nIn  so  doing, the Centre hopes to root Singaporeans,  bridge\r\n\r\nsocial  stratification, and increase interaction,  to  foster\r\n\r\ndeeper community bonding, thereby strengthening the heartware\r\n\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These objectives sound very similar to that of CDCs when\r\n\r\nthey  were  formed  just  two years  earlier,  in  1997.   In\r\n\r\nadopting the \"many helping hands\" approach, MCDS should  also\r\n\r\nbe  careful  to  avoid wasteful duplication of  services  and\r\n\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister tell us what additional measures have\r\n\r\nbeen taken to increase the rate of volunteerism in Singapore?\r\n\r\nAnd VWOs also need to upgrade their services and professional\r\n\r\nstandards to meet the new challenges of an ageing population,\r\n\r\ngrowing social problems, and higher levels of stress  in  the\r\n\r\nfamily.  Given the tough economic climate, more assistance to\r\n\r\nthe voluntary sector is necessary.  I was therefore delighted\r\n\r\nto  hear  the  Minister  announced yesterday  the  additional\r\n\r\nassistance  that will be extended to VWOs.  I am  also  quite\r\n\r\namazed  that he was able to predict exactly what I was  going\r\n\r\nto ask for in my speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the future challenge\r\n\r\nfacing  Singapore  is  not  just  building  more  and  better\r\n\r\nhardware,  but  rather to get Singaporeans in tune  with  the\r\n\r\nsoftware that seeks to develop strong community ties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This challenge to build strong community ties is, to my\r\n\r\nmind, greater than building the infrastructure.  For many  of\r\n\r\nthe grassroots organisations, the question is how do they get\r\n\r\nmore and better people motivated to volunteer their time  and\r\n\r\nservices within the community.  This is an essential part  of\r\n\r\ngetting  people  to take greater ownership of  the  community\r\n\r\nthat they live in.  As my colleague before me\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  said earlier, our participation rate in volunteerism  is\r\n\r\ndismal.   If  I  may just give the figures, in Singapore  our\r\n\r\nvolunteerism rate stands at 9.3% compared to 25%  for  Japan,\r\n\r\nand 55% for the United States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of volunteers, typically, in Singapore, the\r\n\r\nvolunteers  comprise the young and retired Singaporeans.   It\r\n\r\nis  difficult  to  get  those in  the  middle  age  group  to\r\n\r\nparticipate.  Sir, you will agree with me that  at  9.3%,  we\r\n\r\nare  a  far  cry away from the benchmark set by the developed\r\n\r\ncountries elsewhere.  I believe that if we want to build  our\r\n\r\nsoftware  by increasing community bonding within our society,\r\n\r\nwe  must  work  towards increasing the rate of  participation\r\n\r\namongst  Singaporeans.  We know, and we heard  earlier,  that\r\n\r\nthe  National  Volunteer Centre was set up for this  purpose,\r\n\r\nand  that purpose being to promote volunteerism in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn  this  regard,  I  would like to ask  the  Minister  three\r\n\r\nquestions.  First, whether the National Volunteer Centre  has\r\n\r\nmade  much  progress  since its formation,  in  getting  more\r\n\r\nvolunteers to come forward to give off their time and  energy\r\n\r\nto  serving  the community, and to give us an update  of  its\r\n\r\nprogress.   Second, whether or not we can  inculcate  in  our\r\n\r\nyoung a greater spirit of volunteerism that goes beyond  just\r\n\r\nthe perfunctory community service programmes organised by the\r\n\r\nschools  just  to  fulfil its curricula  requirements.   And,\r\n\r\nlastly, whether we can bring volunteerism down, even further,\r\n\r\nto  the grassroots organisations by organising smaller groups\r\n\r\nwithin  each block to encourage residents there in  community\r\n\r\nliving.   Presently,  the  RCs  typically  look  after  11-12\r\n\r\nblocks.  It is not possible for them to pay attention to  all\r\n\r\nthe residents, in all the blocks, and to be aware of all that\r\n\r\nis happening within the community.  By having a smaller group\r\n\r\nin  each  block, it would help the volunteers better able  to\r\n\r\ncreate  a  sense  of community and a sense of belonging,  and\r\n\r\nthus  strengthen community bonding.  I hope the Minister  can\r\n\r\nrespond to the comments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Sir, I agree with\r\n\r\nmany of the points raised by my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolleagues  earlier.   In fact, as a young  multi-racial  and\r\n\r\nmulti-religious country, I believe we will continue  to  face\r\n\r\nchallenges that can either unite or divide our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, I believe that Singaporeans from all\r\n\r\nethnic  and religious groups, share a similar desire  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  we  will  continue to live harmoniously, hopefully,  no\r\n\r\ntensions, no riots, no bloodshed.  We have not had  any  ugly\r\n\r\nincident for more than three decades.  But the problem is  we\r\n\r\ncannot guarantee that this will forever be so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I remember correctly, there were several times when\r\n\r\nthe  temperature rose, and it became somewhat  tense.   Often\r\n\r\ntimes,  it  started  not  as a local  problem.   Instead  the\r\n\r\nsituation  was  actually imported from  real  tensions  which\r\n\r\nhappened elsewhere.  However, due to the active work  of  our\r\n\r\nsecurity  officers, we managed to avoid things  from  getting\r\n\r\nworse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in maintaining racial and religious harmony, I\r\n\r\ndo  not believe it is a good idea for us to rely entirely  on\r\n\r\nour  security  apparatus to do the job.  Instead,  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  all of us, the people of Singapore, from all races  and\r\n\r\nreligions,  should take it as part of our national  duty,  to\r\n\r\nbuild  and  improve  upon  inter-racial  and  inter-religious\r\n\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we need to be able to see each other as part of\r\n\r\nthe big Singapore family.  And as a family we need to reach a\r\n\r\nhigher  level of comfort in the way we deal with one another.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to take care of each other and willingly  help  one\r\n\r\nanother.   And  we  should not let anyone  to  be  sidelined,\r\n\r\nalienated, discriminated, or marginalised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no responsible citizen should leave things to\r\n\r\nchance  when  it  comes to inter-racial  and  inter-religious\r\n\r\nharmony.  I believe we should all play a part.  And  we  need\r\n\r\nto  enhance our social and community bonding in times when we\r\n\r\nare  living in peace and harmony.  I think it is too late  to\r\n\r\nwant to do something when things have already turned ugly. It\r\n\r\nis  like our young men in National Service.  They need to  do\r\n\r\ntheir in-camp and reservist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduties,  and  they are kept prepared to deal  with  difficult\r\n\r\nsituations  whenever it arises.  And we all  hope  that  they\r\n\r\ncould measure up to it when the time comes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, we should all do our best to establish\r\n\r\ntrust  among our people, such that we would be able  to  keep\r\n\r\ncalm and not easily be aroused and fall prey to calls of riot\r\n\r\nand bloodshed.  The real danger in difficult and tense times,\r\n\r\nas   we  can  learn  from  past  incidents,  and  the  recent\r\n\r\nhappenings  in  Gujarat, is the spread of rumours  and  lies,\r\n\r\ndesigned to infuriate different groups against one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are most vulnerable if we lack trust and a sense\r\n\r\nof  one  people,  one nation.  But if we  are  successful  in\r\n\r\nbuilding bonds between the races, we can be resilient  enough\r\n\r\nto  face such trying times and remain a stable and harmonious\r\n\r\ncountry.   I sincerely hope that more Singaporeans  from  all\r\n\r\nraces  and all walks of life will come forward to spend  time\r\n\r\nto  keep  Singapore a safe place, not only for ourselves  but\r\n\r\nalso  for our children and the future generation.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany  ways  for  us to do so, through various  organisations,\r\n\r\nthrough  volunteerism, through the  IRCC.   And  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister, in this case, could share with us his assessment of\r\n\r\nprogress  in  community  bonding,  inter-racial  and   inter-religious   harmony  in  Singapore,  and   what   else   need\r\n\r\nSingaporeans do or do not do in order to maintain and improve\r\n\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, much has\r\n\r\nbeen  talked  about on the need to maintain social  cohesion.\r\n\r\nIt  is  even  more critical for a multi-racial  society  like\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Sir,  the  CDCs were formed  in  1997  with  the\r\n\r\nprimary task of maintaining and enhancing the level of social\r\n\r\ncohesion  in  our society.  Since 1997, the CDCs  have  taken\r\n\r\ndifferent  shapes  and sizes, and today  we  have  five  CDCs\r\n\r\nmanaged by full-time Mayors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the CDCs, the People's Association, with\r\n\r\nits fleet of grassroots organisations, has also been actively\r\n\r\ninvolved in implementing programmes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  aim to enhance social cohesion.  To this end,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister the following questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much has been spent by each CDC in programmes that\r\n\r\naim  to  promote social cohesion?  How do these CDCs  measure\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion?   What are the outcome indicators  used  by\r\n\r\nCDCs  in  ascertaining the effectiveness of their programmes?\r\n\r\nHow much have been achieved thus far, and how much more do we\r\n\r\nneed  to  do?   Has there been any systematic  evaluation  of\r\n\r\nthese  programmes?  If there are, what are the findings?   If\r\n\r\nnot, are there plans to evaluate these programmes?  With  the\r\n\r\nexpanded size of the CDCs, how do they ensure social cohesion\r\n\r\nin their respective geographical areas?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the programmes developed by the CDCs and other\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations oftentimes set the stage and provide\r\n\r\nopportunities for Singaporeans to interact.  However, we have\r\n\r\noften heard the common lament that it is the same people  who\r\n\r\nare  participating in these activities.  If this is so,  what\r\n\r\nis  the profile of Singaporeans who are not actively involved\r\n\r\nin   social   programmes  organised   by   these   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations?  How do MCDS and the CDCs plan to engage  this\r\n\r\ngroup of Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the responsibility of ensuring that social cohesion\r\n\r\nis  enhanced  should not be limited to the  community  sector\r\n\r\nalone.   We  need  to  ensure that  the  other  sectors,  the\r\n\r\nemployment,  the schools, etc, also consciously work  towards\r\n\r\nenhancing  social  cohesion.  To this  end,  may  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  the  extent to which MCDS works  with  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  in enhancing social cohesion in the workplace?   What\r\n\r\nprogrammes have been in place to facilitate this process?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we discussed the issue of social cohesion, we\r\n\r\nmust  also go beyond inter-ethnic relation.  Sir, our society\r\n\r\nis  as hierarchical as any other modern society.  We do  have\r\n\r\ndifferent  levels  of social classes.  Social  cohesion  must\r\n\r\nalso address the relationship between the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent  social classes.  In this regard,  may  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  what is the level of participation of residents  in\r\n\r\nprivate estates in the programmes that aim to promote  social\r\n\r\ncohesion  organised  by  CDCs and  grassroots  organisations?\r\n\r\nSir, as we attempt to narrow the economic divide between  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  social  classes,  we  should  also  work   towards\r\n\r\nnarrowing  the  social  divide.   The  state  of  our  social\r\n\r\ncohesion  is  indeed the responsibility of every Singaporean.\r\n\r\nWe must ensure that Singaporeans understand the circumstances\r\n\r\nthat Singapore is facing, and take ownership of the issue and\r\n\r\nthe  need  to  improve  our  level  of  social  cohesion.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  Ministry, and its related agencies,  can  do\r\n\r\nthat much in providing opportunities for Singaporeans, but if\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  do  not respond, these efforts  would  only  be\r\n\r\nfutile.  Of course, the Ministry should continue its best  to\r\n\r\nattract  and  assist  Singaporeans to identify  and  own  the\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, when we talk\r\n\r\nabout   community  bonding,  normally  we  turn   to   social\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  But the CDCs' experience in the last six months,\r\n\r\nparticularly when we embarked on \"jobs, jobs, jobs\",  it  has\r\n\r\ngiven another dimension to this idea of community bonding and\r\n\r\nsocial  bonding, and I would like to call that the  \"economic\r\n\r\nglue\"  to social cohesion.  I would like to urge the MCDS  to\r\n\r\nexploit the current economic downturn to better forge bonding\r\n\r\nand  social cohesion among our people.  I would like  to  see\r\n\r\nthe   MCDS,   for  example,  to  encourage  the  better-offs,\r\n\r\nparticularly those who have benefited from the IT  boom,  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  are knowledgeable in IT knowledge, to impart  and\r\n\r\nwork  with the other groups, especially those in need of help\r\n\r\nto  promote,  not only better dissemination of knowledge  but\r\n\r\nalso  better  bonding.   I  would be  most  grateful  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister  could share with us MCDS' programmes that put  into\r\n\r\npractice this idea of economic glue to social bonding.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I note with pleasure the\r\n\r\nbudgetary provision for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndouble  tax  deductions to individuals and  corporations  who\r\n\r\ncontribute monies to Institutions of Public Character.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, philanthropy extends beyond giving money to\r\n\r\nthe  needy.  Philanthropy also means giving of our  time  and\r\n\r\nenergy to cater to the needs of the needy in our society.  If\r\n\r\na  society  is  to forge those bonds that make  for  national\r\n\r\ncohesion,  then one of our unsung heroes or heroines  is  one\r\n\r\nwho  makes  the time and the effort to volunteer his  or  her\r\n\r\nservice at these institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers carry a range of out-of-pocket expenses\r\n\r\nassociated  with their work.  The contributions of  time  and\r\n\r\nmoney  made  by volunteers in an emergency situation  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  as  endowments bestowed on the community.   These\r\n\r\nendowments are funded by both volunteers and their employers.\r\n\r\nFor  those  volunteers who are self-employed, their endowment\r\n\r\ncontributions could be substantial.  This situation contrasts\r\n\r\nwith  the  treatment  of  reservists and  the  Armed  Forces,\r\n\r\nvolunteers of another kind.  Where both the participants  and\r\n\r\ntheir employers get many statutory-based tax concessions  and\r\n\r\nother benefits, these are funded by the community through the\r\n\r\ntax  system  to  encourage  their  commitment  and  continued\r\n\r\nparticipation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteerism and community service are a strong and\r\n\r\nimportant  tradition for our nation to cultivate.   Expanding\r\n\r\nopportunities for senior service befits an ageing  population\r\n\r\nlike  Singapore's.  The population of older adults is growing\r\n\r\nrapidly,  and  it  is expected that the ageing  of  the  baby\r\n\r\nboomers  will  accelerate  this growth.   Seniors  today  are\r\n\r\nliving longer than ever before and can often anticipate up to\r\n\r\n30  years  of  productive post-retirement years.   Retirement\r\n\r\nshould be a time of economic security and physical well-being\r\n\r\nand  should also provide seniors more opportunities to  serve\r\n\r\ntheir communities.  Singapore should consider the setting  up\r\n\r\nof  a  national vehicle for senior volunteerism.  This senior\r\n\r\nvoluntary  programme  can  work  with  non-profit  self-based\r\n\r\ngroups,  schools  and  other civic organisations  to  provide\r\n\r\nopportunities for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans of all ages to serve their communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior volunteer group can use the talents, skills\r\n\r\nand experiences of older Singaporeans to help solve problems.\r\n\r\nMembers can help meet a wide range of community needs,  serve\r\n\r\none-to-one  with  young people with special needs,  and  help\r\n\r\nother seniors live independently in their homes.  This senior\r\n\r\ngroup  can organise themselves into various categories,  like\r\n\r\nthe  Retired  and  Senior  Volunteer  Programme,  the  Foster\r\n\r\nGrandparent Programme and the Senior Companion Programme.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  you may argue that the best volunteers will  be  the\r\n\r\nones  who do the job quietly and efficiently, taking the lead\r\n\r\nwithout taking public recognition, knowing full well that the\r\n\r\nhard work and dedication will be recognised in due time, but,\r\n\r\nuntil  then,  happy  with  the  knowledge  that  a  task  was\r\n\r\ncompleted  and  perhaps a life enriched, taking  satisfaction\r\n\r\nfrom  the  wisdom found.  In the first Analect of  Confucius,\r\n\r\n\"To  remain  unoffended, and to feel  no  discomposure,  even\r\n\r\none's  ability  and  accomplishments remain  unrecognised  by\r\n\r\nothers.\"   Is  that not, after all, expected of a  person  of\r\n\r\ncomplete virtue?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Government and the community must\r\n\r\nrecognise   that  it  costs  to  be  a  volunteer.    Without\r\n\r\nappropriate official recognition and support, many volunteers\r\n\r\nhave  begun  to question whether their commitment and  effort\r\n\r\nare  appreciated.  Politicians, judges and the community  may\r\n\r\napplaud the unselfishness of volunteerism, but the values  of\r\n\r\na fair go and equity are also key elements of our Singaporean\r\n\r\nethos and need to be shown to volunteers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managing volunteer participation to ensure the long-term\r\n\r\nsustainability of volunteerism, for example, in the emergency\r\n\r\nservices, will become a significant focus for Singapore after\r\n\r\nSeptember 11.  Many of the agencies in which volunteers serve\r\n\r\nhave vigorous volunteer recruitment, motivation and retention\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  which  include suitable  forms  of  rewards  and\r\n\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister how many individuals, who offer\r\n\r\ntheir  services in the form of time and effort on a voluntary\r\n\r\nbasis to Institutions of Public Character, are recognised for\r\n\r\ntheir voluntary spirit?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the seniors, would the Minister look into\r\n\r\ngranting  some  seed  funding to support a  senior  voluntary\r\n\r\ngroup  which could be the source supplier for volunteer work?\r\n\r\nThis will help to sustain volunteerism in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, Singapore\r\n\r\nis  fast becoming a globalised state.  This is inevitable  if\r\n\r\nwe  were  to plug into the world economy.  But as  we  become\r\n\r\nglobalised,  more  and more of our young generation  will  be\r\n\r\nworking  abroad.  At the same time, an increasing  number  of\r\n\r\nour  children  are  also going overseas for their  education.\r\n\r\nThis  in itself is not necessarily a bad thing.  However,  as\r\n\r\nmore  and more Singaporeans are going overseas, the issue  of\r\n\r\nnational identity and rootedness becomes more acute.  We need\r\n\r\nto  address  this issue urgently or we will risk  losing  our\r\n\r\nyounger  generation.  Home ownership, Sir, is  no  longer  an\r\n\r\neffective  means  to hold them back.  We need  a  new  raison\r\n\r\nd'etre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what programmes\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry  has to address this issue.   Perhaps  I  could\r\n\r\nsuggest a two-pronged approach to reach out to the hearts  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  These are: passion and participation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passion: passion for Singapore, passion for the\r\n\r\ncommunity, passion for the family and passion for friendship.\r\n\r\nFamily  and  community  bonding is an  important  element  in\r\n\r\nfostering   rootedness.   I  have  spoken  to  a  number   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who are contemplating migration.   One  of  the\r\n\r\nmajor  reasons that is holding them back is the  relationship\r\n\r\nthey have with their family members here and their friends in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Sir, I would like to urge the Minister  to  look\r\n\r\ninto  programmes  and  initiatives that would  encourage  our\r\n\r\npeople  and help them build closer relationships and stronger\r\n\r\nbonds with their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfamily  members  and their friends.  This is particularly  so\r\n\r\nfor  the younger generation.  This way, their roots here will\r\n\r\nbe  strengthened.  For this purpose, perhaps we can designate\r\n\r\npart of the Marina Esplanade as a Youth Corner, to allow  our\r\n\r\nyounger  generation  to hang out and to  make  friends.   The\r\n\r\nplace must, firstly, be youth-friendly.  We can also organise\r\n\r\nwholesome and exciting activities, not boring ones, that will\r\n\r\nengage the young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation: active citizenship and participation in\r\n\r\nnation  building.  One of the factors that are  pushing  some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  away is the sense that they have  no  place  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   They  have  to choose between  being  nobody  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  or  being somebody in a less competitive  country.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot reduce the competitive spirit, but I would like to\r\n\r\nappeal to the Ministry to create more space for Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nand give them greater opportunity to participate in important\r\n\r\nmatters  such as nation building.  This will make  them  know\r\n\r\nand  feel  that they have an important role to  play  in  the\r\n\r\nmaking  of  Singapore, that they have a say in shaping  their\r\n\r\ncollective   future.   This  way,  we  can   promote   active\r\n\r\ncitizenship and strengthen the sense of belonging.   We  must\r\n\r\ntake  the feedback from the people seriously.  Change, if  we\r\n\r\nagree  to  the feedback, and explain if we do not agree  with\r\n\r\nthem.   Otherwise, we may end like what some of the residents\r\n\r\nsay about feedback - feed, but nothing comes back.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, national identity and rootedness cannot be\r\n\r\ndeveloped  overnight.  We have come quite a long  way,  given\r\n\r\nthe  short history that we have.  However, more needs  to  be\r\n\r\ndone  and  can  be done.  I believe passion and participation\r\n\r\nare  the  keys  to  building a strong national  identity  and\r\n\r\nactive citizenship.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, yesterday I spoke about\r\n\r\ngrowing  old.   It  is always a pleasure to  talk  about  the\r\n\r\nyouth, for after all they are our future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Community Development and Sports\r\n\r\nhas  identified one of its objectives as being rooting  youth\r\n\r\nwith our shared values.  I think that is a very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant  area, and I am glad that the Ministry  has  chosen\r\n\r\nthat  as one of its key objectives.  But I would like to just\r\n\r\nraise  a few questions in the context of shared values \"in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  world\" which, I think, the Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nspoke about when he tabled the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are indeed facing a very different world. More and\r\n\r\nmore  of  our  youths are travelling, studying overseas,  and\r\n\r\nthey  will  imbibe  the kind of values  which  may  be  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent  from ours.  Looking at those kinds of  challenges,\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the programmes in place to make us root our  youth\r\n\r\nbetter  to  the kind of changing world and, more importantly,\r\n\r\nthe  changing Singapore?  There are very serious  issues  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  faces, especially post-911, which,  I  think,  the\r\n\r\nyouth  must  understand  fully, eg, what  multi-racialism  is\r\n\r\nabout, what are the challenges facing a young society,  which\r\n\r\nis very keen on nation building, especially in the context of\r\n\r\nour multi-racial, multi-religious Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to share with us,\r\n\r\nagain, the thinking and the programmes which the Ministry has\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  what it means by rooting our  youth  with  our\r\n\r\nshared values.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, it is heartening\r\n\r\nto  note  that  the standard of corporate governance  in  our\r\n\r\npublic  companies in Singapore has improved in recent  years.\r\n\r\nThis  follows  a  gradual  implementation  of  the  Code   of\r\n\r\nCorporate  Governance practices recommended by the  Corporate\r\n\r\nGovernance  Committee some 1 1/2 years ago.  There  has  also\r\n\r\nbeen  some adoption of better governance practices among  the\r\n\r\nlarger    private   companies,   including   having   greater\r\n\r\ntransparency and more independent audit committees and  board\r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in the area of non-profit charitable\r\n\r\norganisations, there are currently no such practice codes  to\r\n\r\nguide  and strengthen the management of large sums of  public\r\n\r\nmonies.   For  example,  from time to time,  there  has  been\r\n\r\npublic  disquiet or criticism over the use of funds by  large\r\n\r\ncharitable organisations,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  NKF,  Community Chest, and so on.   I  believe  greater\r\n\r\noversight   of   charitable   organisations,   through    the\r\n\r\nformalisation of a proper governance code similar  to  public\r\n\r\ncompanies,  may  help  strengthen  and  further  enhance  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of Singaporeans who contribute to charities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formulation of a Code of Good Governance\r\n\r\nPractices  for  charitable organisations  is  indeed  timely.\r\n\r\nWhy?   Because  in  the  recent Budget debate,  DPM  Lee  has\r\n\r\nproposed  that  double tax relief be given for  donations  to\r\n\r\nInstitutions of Public Character (IPC).  IPC status  is  also\r\n\r\nmade more readily available for qualifying charitable private\r\n\r\nfoundations.  Sir, I see this as part of the national  effort\r\n\r\nto encourage more Singaporeans to donate to charities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the promulgation of such a code rests with\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner of Charities under the Ministry of Finance,\r\n\r\nand  MCDS'  role  is  just  to help promote  more  charitable\r\n\r\ngiving.   Nevertheless, I would like to ask the  Minister  if\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry  is  working closely with MOF and  the  various\r\n\r\nagencies under his charge to develop and implement a Code  of\r\n\r\nPractice  for fund-raising, in line with the national  effort\r\n\r\nto  promote transparency and ensure greater accountability in\r\n\r\nthe  use of public monies, which include charities.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  recommend that this be looked into so  that  public\r\n\r\naccountability can be strengthened and that kind and generous\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  can  be assured that their money  is  going  to\r\n\r\nwhere their hearts want it to go.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, let's all be charitable\r\n\r\nbut, I am sure, not with time, I am sure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have set ourselves the laudable task and mission\r\n\r\nof  becoming a gracious society.  But we all know that we are\r\n\r\nstill  far  from  that  target, the Small  Kindness  Movement\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding.    The  call  for  TUP  (Toilets   Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme) and kiasuism are some of the examples to show that\r\n\r\nwe  still  have  some way to progress.  But I am  very  happy\r\n\r\nindeed  to  see the Deputy Prime Minister and the  Government\r\n\r\npromoting philanthropy.

I agree that  we  must\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   show   our  care  and  concern   for   fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, and to contribute as members of our society  to\r\n\r\nworthy projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to add that while the Government\r\n\r\nin  being  generous in the new areas which they are  offering\r\n\r\ntax  rebates, I would like to also propose that  perhaps  for\r\n\r\nthose  organisations without IPC status, the Government could\r\n\r\nalso  consider on a project-to-project basis, worthy projects\r\n\r\nand  good programmes, which I think deserve community support\r\n\r\nand philanthropy.  Perhaps, the Government could also look at\r\n\r\nthem on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I like to thank\r\n\r\nMembers for all their charitable remarks for MCDS.  First,  I\r\n\r\nlike  to thank Mr Charles Chong and other Members for raising\r\n\r\ntheir  concerns  about social cohesion.  We all  are  equally\r\n\r\nconcerned that this is an important area.  But let me try and\r\n\r\naddress  this in a larger context before I take some specific\r\n\r\nissues.   As I see it, there are two very important concerns:\r\n\r\nfirst, the communal divide, and, second, the material divide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first describe what I see as the fundamental\r\n\r\nprinciples  of managing communal relations for  the  last  40\r\n\r\nyears.   Basically,  there are three  principles.   First,  a\r\n\r\nsecular  government  that \"holds the  ring\"  and  takes  firm\r\n\r\naction against disruptive elements.  Second, equal access  to\r\n\r\nall  communities  to  basic  services,  that  is,  education,\r\n\r\nhousing,  medical care, and so on. In this way, no one  group\r\n\r\nwill  feel denied or marginalised.  And, third, the principle\r\n\r\nof meritocracy, where everyone advances by his own merit, not\r\n\r\nbecause he belongs to a certain group, race or religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this model for maintaining communal harmony has\r\n\r\nserved us well for more than four decades of nation building.\r\n\r\nA  Survey on Social Attitudes commissioned by my Ministry and\r\n\r\nconducted in the first half of 2001, found that 9 out  of  10\r\n\r\nSingaporeans were generally satisfied with race relations  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, with the Malays being slightly more likely  to  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied than the Chinese and the Indians.  The Survey  also\r\n\r\nfound  that  a  vast  majority of  Singaporeans,  about  97%,\r\n\r\nthought it was good to have people of different races  living\r\n\r\nin  the  same  neighbourhood.  And  not  only  that,  98%  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans were comfortable with the idea of allowing their\r\n\r\nchildren to play with children of other races.  There were no\r\n\r\nsignificant differences between the different races  in  this\r\n\r\nregard.  So across-the-board, everyone feels comfortable  for\r\n\r\ntheir  son to play with the son of a neighbour who  may  come\r\n\r\nfrom a different group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost 9 in 10, or 89%, of Singaporeans found their\r\n\r\nneighbours  helpful and friendly, and with Malay Singaporeans\r\n\r\nbeing  slightly  more  upbeat than their  Chinese  or  Indian\r\n\r\ncounterparts.   82% of Singaporeans thought that  they  could\r\n\r\nturn to their neighbours for help in times of need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in general, based upon the survey that we had done\r\n\r\non  attitudes, communal relations look to be  good.   But  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  you must remember this survey was conducted  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  half  of  2001.   And foremost in  the  minds  of  us,\r\n\r\nundoubtedly, in Mr Zainul Abidin's mind, events of  September\r\n\r\n11 and, of course, December 2001 have placed some stresses on\r\n\r\nour  communal  relations.   My Ministry  will  be  conducting\r\n\r\nanother  survey to see whether or not the views have changed.\r\n\r\nSo  the  first  set of surveys will help us to establish  the\r\n\r\nbaseline  for  us to manage or to understand  where  communal\r\n\r\nrelations are going.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even before the event of September 11, the Survey\r\n\r\non  Social  Attitudes  found  that,  whilst  Singaporeans  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  are  satisfied  with communal  relations,  there  is\r\n\r\nactually  one very striking difference - younger Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwere significantly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nless  satisfied with race and religious relations than  older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans above 30 years of age.  So we need to understand\r\n\r\nbetter  the  reasons for this generational  difference  which\r\n\r\ncould   be   rooted  in  the  life  experiences  of   younger\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share what Mdm Ho and Mr Maidin have raised that\r\n\r\nour  people  are  our  core aspect of defence.   How  we,  as\r\n\r\ncitizens,  respond to the events of late 2001, or  indeed  to\r\n\r\nany crisis, such as terrorist attack on our country, would be\r\n\r\ncritical  to  the  test of our cohesion  and  maturity  as  a\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the HDB housing policies and efforts by the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association and MOE in the community and schools, we\r\n\r\nhave  tried  to  maintain  an  integrated  environment  where\r\n\r\ndifferent  races  can mingle.  The survey findings,  I  cited\r\n\r\nearlier, show how our inter-racial ties are good, but I think\r\n\r\nwe need to build more upon this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the promotion of harmonious communal relations\r\n\r\nis an on-going journey that all communities in Singapore have\r\n\r\nto take and we will have to adapt as we go along.  The coming\r\n\r\nof  age of a younger generation of Singaporeans means that we\r\n\r\nneed   to   re-energise   our   efforts   at   inter-communal\r\n\r\ncommunication,  to  re-discover  each  other  if   need   be,\r\n\r\nespecially in relation to what has happened in the  last  few\r\n\r\nmonths.   Each  community in every generation will  have  new\r\n\r\nviews,  new  mindsets, new influences and,  maybe,  even  new\r\n\r\nblind  spots.  So we cannot assume that the foundations  that\r\n\r\nunderlay  the comfort level among older Singaporeans  can  be\r\n\r\nunderstood,  appreciated,  or even replicated,  by  different\r\n\r\ngenerations.   Indeed, a new generation  will  have  to  work\r\n\r\ntogether  to  create  their  own comfort  zones  and  comfort\r\n\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communal harmony does not mean that each community\r\n\r\ninsisting  on  having its way.  Indeed, all communities  must\r\n\r\nlearn  to  give  and to take, and no community should  labour\r\n\r\nunder  the  false  impression that they are always  the  ones\r\n\r\nhaving to make concessions.  What\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  needed  is an understanding and readiness to  accommodate\r\n\r\none another in the interest of the greater national good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is where I believe the various grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations,  community-based  organisations,  schools  and\r\n\r\nInter-Racial  Confidence Circles (IRCCs) can  play  a  useful\r\n\r\nrole.   In  response to our Prime Minister's call, there  are\r\n\r\nnow about 38 IRCCs created and they are made up of leaders of\r\n\r\ndifferent  ethnic groups and organisations in the  community.\r\n\r\nThey  organise programmes to help residents better appreciate\r\n\r\none  another's culture and religion.  By July this  year,  we\r\n\r\nhope  to form IRCCs in all constituencies.  Mr Charles  Chong\r\n\r\nhas asked us about the composition and how successful we have\r\n\r\nbeen.   From  the  best  of my knowledge,  in  terms  of  the\r\n\r\ncomposition,  we have been able to attract the non-grassroots\r\n\r\norganisation type into the IRCCs.  But having said  that,  we\r\n\r\nare leaving it to the various IRCCs.  So you may form an IRCC\r\n\r\nof  10  members.   It  does not mean you should  stop  at  10\r\n\r\nmembers.  You can continue to expand and bring in new leaders\r\n\r\nthat  you  think will be helpful in your IRCC.   These  IRCCs\r\n\r\nwill  play  an  important role, should  there  be  a  crisis,\r\n\r\nbecause  they will help to maintain calm and manage relations\r\n\r\nin the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are also embarking on many activities to promote\r\n\r\nracial  harmony.  I believe such cross-cultural  appreciation\r\n\r\nand  interaction  from young will help to pave  the  way  for\r\n\r\nbonds and friendships to be cemented across the races.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the effort to get to know one another must take\r\n\r\nplace  from the ground up and from the young.  And the effort\r\n\r\nmust  also  be sustained.  The learning must start with  what\r\n\r\neach  community is all about - the identities,  the  beliefs,\r\n\r\nthe  values  and  the  practices.  The  learning  must  cover\r\n\r\nuniqueness,  but  more  importantly,  it  must  also  address\r\n\r\ncommonalities - what are the values and objectives  that  all\r\n\r\ncommunities  share that bind us together,  in  spite  of  our\r\n\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to share with you an example. I am sure\r\n\r\nother Members can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelate  to  the same example.  Just recently, the Kolam  Ayer\r\n\r\nIRCC organised a group of grassroots leaders and residents to\r\n\r\nvisit  the Sri Mariamman Temple and the Taoist Man  Sun  Fook\r\n\r\nTuck Chee Temple, both in Jalan Besar GRC.  Participants from\r\n\r\ndifferent  religions found that they all pray  for  the  same\r\n\r\nthing - harmony, peace, prosperity and happiness.  So when we\r\n\r\nrecognise  the things that we share in common and hold  dear,\r\n\r\nstronger bonds can be developed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the second potential area that\r\n\r\ncould  affect social cohesion, and that is a growing material\r\n\r\ndivide.   As  mentioned by some Members in the House,  income\r\n\r\ndisparity  is  inevitable in a globalised economy  that  pays\r\n\r\nknowledge  workers a premium but where the pay  of  unskilled\r\n\r\nworkers  is  constantly being beaten down by  cheaper  labour\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  Disparity itself is not a bad thing, but a  sense\r\n\r\nof  divide can be dangerous.  So we need to build bridges and\r\n\r\nbonds  across  all levels of society as well  as  all  social\r\n\r\nclasses.   We  need a culture where the more  successful  are\r\n\r\nmotivated  to \"give back to society\" and help those  who  are\r\n\r\nless successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now address some of the concerns raised by\r\n\r\nMembers - Mr Charles Chong, Mr Maidin, Mdm Ho and Mr Sin Boon\r\n\r\nAnn.  They have all called for more Singaporeans to be active\r\n\r\ncitizens  and to volunteer their time to help those  who  are\r\n\r\nless fortunate.  First, Mr Charles Chong and Mr Sin Boon  Ann\r\n\r\nhave  pointed out that our volunteerism rate, which is  9.3%,\r\n\r\nlags  behind  some other developed countries.  Although  this\r\n\r\nfigure looks small, I believe there is a growing interest  in\r\n\r\nvoluntary   service,  and  there  is  a   lot   of   informal\r\n\r\nvolunteering   by   Singaporeans,  such   as   helping   your\r\n\r\nneighbours,  keeping an eye on the house  of  your  neighbour\r\n\r\nwhen they are away on holiday, feeding the cat, and the like.\r\n\r\nThese  are  all not captured in the statistics.  So  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  an  under-reporting.  More than anything  else,  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  be complacent, we should work towards increasing\r\n\r\nthat rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the core, the people sector is made up of ordinary\r\n\r\npeople  who are moved to do something, big or small, for  the\r\n\r\nwider community.  I could cite many heartwarming examples but\r\n\r\nlet me just mention one:  Rachel Ong, a very successful young\r\n\r\nprofessional,  who helped to start a programme called  Thumbs\r\n\r\nUp  to help teenagers build their self-esteem and reach their\r\n\r\npotential.  She also roped in her friends, many of  whom  are\r\n\r\nbusy  young  professionals, to volunteer with the  programme.\r\n\r\nThe  programme achieved overwhelming response from over 6,000\r\n\r\nstudents  in less than a year.  I see people like Rachel  and\r\n\r\nher friends as part of a bridge across the material divide in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have raised the point on how we should\r\n\r\nappreciate the efforts of volunteers.  Mdm Ho touched  a  bit\r\n\r\non  some  of  the  incentives which  are  given  to  National\r\n\r\nServicemen.  I am not sure whether she is suggesting that  we\r\n\r\nshould  give  tax  rebates  to volunteers.   But  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nfinancial  incentives  are not the  only  reason  why  people\r\n\r\nvolunteer their time and resources.  How do we actually value\r\n\r\nand  quantify volunteers' time and contributions  across  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  activities?   It is a very difficult  question  to\r\n\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are important factors that help volunteers to come\r\n\r\nforward,   such  as  the  supportive  family  and  supportive\r\n\r\nemployers,   the  desire  to  contribute,  and  a  fulfilling\r\n\r\nvolunteering experience.  Obviously, they must feel fulfilled\r\n\r\nwhen  they  go down to the schools, or to the home,  or  even\r\n\r\nhelping out in the neighbourhood.  People just do not want to\r\n\r\nfeel  that they are wasting their time.  Today, more educated\r\n\r\nvolunteers  seek meaningful volunteering opportunities  which\r\n\r\ncapitalise on their skills and they have to fit in with their\r\n\r\nown work-life commitments because there are other demands  on\r\n\r\ntheir time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many volunteers may also find it increasingly difficult,\r\n\r\ngiven  their time constraints, to commit themselves  for  too\r\n\r\nlong to any one particular cause or programme.  They may have\r\n\r\nan hour a week, or two days a month, that they can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontribute.   How  do you slot that into  the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary  organisation is a challenge for  all  of  us.   So\r\n\r\nvolunteer  host organisations will have to respond creatively\r\n\r\nto these trends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, other than attracting more volunteers, a\r\n\r\ncritical  challenge that we face is to help the organisations\r\n\r\nstrengthen  their  capabilities  to  manage  volunteers  more\r\n\r\neffectively,  and thereby nurture a culture that  appreciates\r\n\r\nand recognises volunteers.  Previously, volunteering means we\r\n\r\nare spending time on a particular project organised by a VWO.\r\n\r\nWe  came forward and gave our time without really knowing the\r\n\r\ndetails of the project.  Now, we need to better manage  those\r\n\r\nexpectations because some of them may not have the luxury  of\r\n\r\ntime as some others may have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Volunteer Centre (NVC) works closely\r\n\r\nwith  the volunteer host organisations to put in place a good\r\n\r\nvolunteer   management   practice,   for   example,   through\r\n\r\nconsultancy and training.  There are various awards  also  to\r\n\r\nrecognise volunteers' contributions.  At the highest  levels,\r\n\r\nthese  include the President's Social Service Awards and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, the National Day Awards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NVC will not replace the CDC, but they will\r\n\r\nplay  a  complementary role in fostering  community  bonding.\r\n\r\nThe  NVC  is  actively partnering CDCs to support  volunteer-driven  programmes  at the community level.   As  a  national\r\n\r\nbody,  what the NVC will do is to set standards in  volunteer\r\n\r\nmanagement  practices  and  administer  national  awards  for\r\n\r\nvolunteer coordinators and volunteer host organisations.   So\r\n\r\nthe  NVC  will  therefore augment, or value  add,  the  CDC's\r\n\r\nefforts  by  providing consultancy and  advice  on  volunteer\r\n\r\nmanagement practices and training.  Promoting volunteering is\r\n\r\njust  one of the ways in which CDCs encourage their residents\r\n\r\nto have a strong sense of ownership in the local community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the matter of philanthropy.\r\n\r\nBefore  that,  Mdm Ho has made two specific suggestions,  ie,\r\n\r\nfunding  for a senior citizens' volunteer group.  I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier, in my speech,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we have launched a $5 million fund for an active senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  programme.   Six projects have  been  approved  and\r\n\r\nthese  projects  are  meant  to promote  specifically  inter-generational  bonding and to engage our senior citizens.   So\r\n\r\nany  group  is welcome to submit proposals to this particular\r\n\r\nproject so that they tap the money for the purpose which  Mdm\r\n\r\nHo has suggested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address another point. Mdm Ho may know that\r\n\r\nthere  are already existing senior citizens organisations  at\r\n\r\nthe national level, such as RSVP and SAGE. So these are again\r\n\r\norganisations  that could easily tap on the funds  which  are\r\n\r\nmade  available, through the Ministry, to run programmes,  to\r\n\r\ndraw  upon  the  volunteers and make sure  that  they  remain\r\n\r\nactive and engaged within the community.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sin Boon Ann has also asked what else can be\r\n\r\ndone and what sort of impact have we made after the formation\r\n\r\nof the NVC.  We did a volunteer benchmark survey in 2000.   I\r\n\r\ndo  not have the results of the survey here.  But we will  do\r\n\r\nanother  survey this year to assess the progress.  There  are\r\n\r\nother  signs of progress that NVC has made an impact.   There\r\n\r\nis greater awareness, and the media has helped us in terms of\r\n\r\npromoting  some  of  the good examples.  Last  year  was  the\r\n\r\nInternational  Year of Volunteers 2001, so  we  had  a  whole\r\n\r\nrange  of programmes.  One particularly interesting programme\r\n\r\nis  \"Volunteer as a Family\" that was promoted by the NVC.  So\r\n\r\nthere  are  many efforts in place.  I hope Members  can  wait\r\n\r\nuntil  the second survey, when we can do an analysis  of  the\r\n\r\nprogress of our efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Sin also suggested that in order to promote\r\n\r\nthe  sense of volunteerism, we should try and work  with  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations to build smaller units  instead  of\r\n\r\nthe  RCs.   I  am  sure Members have heard  about  the  Block\r\n\r\nRepresentatives.  I understand some constituencies  have  it,\r\n\r\nsome  do  not.  But these are schemes, that I agree  with  Mr\r\n\r\nSin, that we could work towards, forming\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmaller  units,  because some of the estates may  have  grown\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  we need small and nimble units.   There  is\r\n\r\nnothing  to prevent that from happening.  I am sure we  could\r\n\r\nwork with PA on how we can further push this process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a strong and close-knit society, the more\r\n\r\nsuccessful  must see it as their responsibility to  help  the\r\n\r\nless   successful.    We   have  many   examples   of   early\r\n\r\nphilanthropists,  such as Dato Lee Kong Chian,  Dr  Lim  Boon\r\n\r\nKeng,  the various Arab families, such as the Aljunieds,  the\r\n\r\nAlkaffs  and  the Alsagoffs, Mr Mohammed Eunos  Abdullah,  Mr\r\n\r\nGovindasamy  Pillai, and many others who have contributed  to\r\n\r\nthe building of modern Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To nurture a supportive environment and charitable\r\n\r\ngiving, my Ministry will work with our partners, such as  the\r\n\r\nNational  Council of Social Service and the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nCharities  under IRAS, to promote the value of  philanthropy,\r\n\r\nto    support   informed-giving   and   to   strengthen   the\r\n\r\naccountability  of  charities.   The  public  will  be   more\r\n\r\nconfident    about   supporting   charities,   if   charities\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  that  they are responsible in fund-raising,  and\r\n\r\nwise and prudent in using the donated funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to set the pace, the Community Chest will increase\r\n\r\nits  efforts  to reach out to the donor community.   ComChest\r\n\r\nwill  keep  donors  regularly updated on  its  work  and  the\r\n\r\nresults  of their donations.  It will continue to  give  full\r\n\r\nand  transparent  accounts of its stewardship  of  the  funds\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with Mr Chew Heng Ching that we must\r\n\r\nensure that charities remain accountable and responsible.  My\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  working  closely with the National  Council  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Service  (NCSS) to draw up a code of good  governance\r\n\r\nfor  voluntary welfare organisations this year.  NCSS is also\r\n\r\ndeveloping codes and guidelines for VWOs, covering areas such\r\n\r\nas  programme development, financial accountability and fund-raising practices.  NCSS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso organises workshops for VWOs on these topics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCSS is also studying the feasibility of requiring its\r\n\r\nmembers  to comply with a code on fund-raising practices,  in\r\n\r\norder for the donors to continue to enjoy tax exemption.  The\r\n\r\ncode will address many issues including, for example, how  to\r\n\r\ndeal with fund-raising appeals that are being made after  the\r\n\r\ntarget  has  been  achieved.  Another issue  is  fund-raising\r\n\r\nethics,  eg,  the  use  of  children  and  how  children  are\r\n\r\napproached to raise funds for charities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also working on requiring Institutions\r\n\r\nof  Public  Character  (IPCs) and charities  to  place  their\r\n\r\nessential  profile and financial information on the Internet.\r\n\r\nThis  will give donors and members of the public easy  access\r\n\r\nto  information on how donations are disbursed and the  types\r\n\r\nof  activities which are being funded and undertaken  by  the\r\n\r\nIPCs  and  the charities.  MOF has sought feedback  from  the\r\n\r\npublic  and  they are supportive.  So my Ministry is  working\r\n\r\nwith  NCSS  and MOF to provide more information online  about\r\n\r\nsuch  best  practices so that donors can make  more  informed\r\n\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to note that NCSS is helping the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  set up an online donation portal  on  the  e-Citizen  website  by the end of this year.  The  portal  will\r\n\r\nmake  it easy for people to donate to Institutions of  Public\r\n\r\nCharacter  of  their choice.  It will also  have  information\r\n\r\nabout  the  participating IPCs to help promote more  informed\r\n\r\ngiving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to strengthen community bonding among Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nwe   need   a   good  infrastructure  and  strong   voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations  to serve as effective platforms for  community\r\n\r\nparticipation.  However, most importantly, it is people  like\r\n\r\nyou  and  me,  who  are  at the heart of  it  all,  community\r\n\r\nleaders, volunteers and citizens, stepping forward as  active\r\n\r\ncitizens to make a difference to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I can now address some of the specific concerns\r\n\r\nraised by Members.  Both Mr Gan Kim Yong and Mr Zainul\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbidin  have raised pertinent questions on the rootedness  of\r\n\r\nour  youths and how to keep them engaged and young.   Mr  Gan\r\n\r\nhas  made  an interesting suggestion of a programme based  on\r\n\r\npassion  and participation.  Somehow, it did not  escape  me,\r\n\r\nbut  the acronym is PAP!  We share the Member's concern, Sir.\r\n\r\nIndeed, with increased globalisation and ease of connectivity\r\n\r\nwith the rest of the world, our youths will increasingly  see\r\n\r\nthemselves  as global citizens.  This is not a bad  thing  in\r\n\r\nitself.   It becomes a challenge, however, if their sense  of\r\n\r\nglobal citizenship replaces or outstrips their attachment and\r\n\r\ncommitment to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Zainul that our young is our future, and\r\n\r\nwe recognise that for our youths to become effectively rooted\r\n\r\nto  Singapore, they must be informed and engaged in  national\r\n\r\nissues.   They must also feel that they have a stake  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety through active involvement in various programmes.  We\r\n\r\nhave, for example, the National Education programme which  is\r\n\r\nconducted  by  MOE, and the various Government  agencies  are\r\n\r\npart of the Government's effort to educate, expose and engage\r\n\r\nour  young  Singaporeans.  The National Youth  Council  (NYC)\r\n\r\norganises and supports programmes, such as the National Youth\r\n\r\nSeminar,  Prime Minister's dialogue with young  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nthe   Polytechnic   Forum  and  ITE  Seminar,   where   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans can express their views on national  issues  and\r\n\r\nplay a part in policy making.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was involved in some of these seminars, and I\r\n\r\nhave   found  our  youths,  far  from  being  detached  about\r\n\r\nSingapore,  are  passionate  about  some  of  the  issues  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and they are prepared to raise their ideas without\r\n\r\nany  inhibitions.   The  Youth Expedition  Project  organised\r\n\r\njointly by the NYC and the Singapore International Foundation\r\n\r\nbrings  youths to another country to experience, reflect  and\r\n\r\ndiscuss  issues concerning the country they visit and  relate\r\n\r\nthese lessons to Singapore.  Such experiences will strengthen\r\n\r\ntheir  conviction  about their roles and obligations  towards\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CDCs have also created many platforms for the\r\n\r\nactive involvement of our youths in the community.  The \"Dare\r\n\r\nto  Dream  Fund\" administered by the Northeast  CDC  and  the\r\n\r\n\"Young  Leaders Community Project\" by the Northwest CDC  and,\r\n\r\nif  I  may  add,  the  \"High-5 Youth Award\"  by  the  Central\r\n\r\nSingapore  CDC are some good examples of ways to attract  the\r\n\r\nyoung into community involvement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Volunteer Centre has also been working with\r\n\r\nthe   schools   to  interest  their  students  in   community\r\n\r\ninvolvement and volunteer projects.  I am glad to report that\r\n\r\nin  a  recent National Volunteer Centre survey, it was  found\r\n\r\nthat almost one-third of those between 15 and 24 years of age\r\n\r\nhave  done some form of voluntary work.  My Ministry believes\r\n\r\nthat  by engaging our youths in discussions and allowing them\r\n\r\nto  turn  their  ideas  into  deeds  through  youth-initiated\r\n\r\ncommunity projects, we build in them a sense of ownership and\r\n\r\nbelonging.  The issue of rooting our young is, of  course,  a\r\n\r\nmulti-faceted one.  Yet, I think it boils down to  one  thing\r\n\r\nwhich  Mr  Gan has pointed out - creating ties that bind,  to\r\n\r\nfriends and families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can provide social anchors for our youths, be it\r\n\r\nthrough  strengthening family ties, education,  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor community participation, or simply involving them in more\r\n\r\nof our discussions, we will be sending a strong signal to our\r\n\r\nyouths  that we value them and that they belong to Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  assure Members of the House that my Ministry will continue\r\n\r\nto work with other agencies to create and sustain these ties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have answered most of the queries. I have\r\n\r\nmentioned  about  IRCCs.   At an appropriate  time,  we  will\r\n\r\nreport on the progress of the various efforts of the IRCCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has raised some concerns about whether or not\r\n\r\nwe are going beyond the usual people that we are engaging in.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to assure Members that we are also  concerned\r\n\r\nabout  that.  Obviously, in order to attract more people,  we\r\n\r\nhave to bring in new faces, but this is where volunteer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanagement becomes a very important aspect of how we are able\r\n\r\nto draw some of these people, not only in terms of programmes\r\n\r\nbut to be able to contribute their time and resources to some\r\n\r\nof the programmes that we conduct.  I do agree with him, as I\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier, that we have to bridge the social classes,\r\n\r\nand  this is where our appeal to the more successful to  come\r\n\r\nforward is indeed something that we will continue to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul has mentioned specifically about how we root\r\n\r\nour  young in relation to what has happened, ie, 911.   Later\r\n\r\non,  I  will  touch on what MUIS is trying to do  beyond  the\r\n\r\nconfines of just the Malay-Muslim community, to reach out  to\r\n\r\na  cross-section of the non-Muslim community,  including  the\r\n\r\nyoung.  I hope the hon. Member can bear with me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with respect to the suggestion by Mr Gan Kim\r\n\r\nYong  that  perhaps a place in Marina Esplanade be set  aside\r\n\r\nfor  youths, we do have a place in Orchard Road,  called  the\r\n\r\nYouth  Park,  which  is  meant for  our  young.   Other  than\r\n\r\nphysical  spaces,  I  would  like  to  assure  Members   that\r\n\r\nopportunities  for our young to contribute  their  ideas  are\r\n\r\navailable  and continue to increase, eg, the efforts  by  the\r\n\r\nRemaking Singapore Committee.   The Committee is reaching out\r\n\r\nto a whole cross-section of people, including our young.  The\r\n\r\nsame thing was done during the Singapore 21 exercise in which\r\n\r\nI  was  involved.  We will reach out to the school  students,\r\n\r\nthe polytechnics, the JCs and the universities, to create not\r\n\r\nonly physical spaces but also virtual spaces for them to come\r\n\r\nforward  to  contribute ideas and suggestions.  I know  there\r\n\r\nare  programmes being undertaken by the CDCs with some  youth\r\n\r\ngroups  to carry out programmes to further entrench  some  of\r\n\r\nthese youths who have come forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered most of the queries raised\r\n\r\nby Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I think the Minister has not\r\n\r\nanswered my questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it if he could answer my questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I would like to thank\r\n\r\nMdm Halimah for reminding me.  Mdm Halimah has asked in Malay\r\n\r\nabout   the   People's  Association's  survey  on  grassroots\r\n\r\nparticipation  and efforts in strengthening  racial  harmony.\r\n\r\nDr  Maliki has also raised about the efforts of the CDCs  and\r\n\r\nthe People's Association in enhancing social cohesion and how\r\n\r\nthis can be measured.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to add that I chaired a committee in\r\n\r\nPA to look into how we can strengthen participation among the\r\n\r\nvarious communities in Singapore.  We have launched a  couple\r\n\r\nof  programmes through the various groups that we have in the\r\n\r\nCCs.  But, if I could seek Mdm Halimah's indulgence, Minister\r\n\r\nof  State,  Mr  Chan  Soo  Sen, will address  some  of  them,\r\n\r\ntogether with the other issues that both Mdm Halimah  and  Dr\r\n\r\nMaliki have raised in their cuts on PA and CDCs, and we  will\r\n\r\ngive a more complete reply to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, in September 2000, the Committee\r\n\r\non  Sporting Singapore (CoSS) was set up to review  and  make\r\n\r\nstrategic  recommendations on how sports  should  be  further\r\n\r\ndeveloped   in  Singapore.   The  main  Steering   Committee,\r\n\r\ncomprising three Ministers and a Minister of State, had  four\r\n\r\nequally  high-powered sub-committees.  These  committees  met\r\n\r\nbetween September 2000 and May 2001, and involved almost  the\r\n\r\nentire  sporting fraternity in Singapore.  The objective,  in\r\n\r\nthe  words  of the former Minister for Community  Development\r\n\r\nand Sports, ie, yourself, Sir, was \"To question fundamentals,\r\n\r\ndiscuss possibilities, re-examine priorities and explore  our\r\n\r\ndreams  for  sports in Singapore.\"  The Committee  eventually\r\n\r\nsubmitted  its report with 40 recommendations that would  set\r\n\r\nthe  directions  for  sports development  in  Singapore.   To\r\n\r\nimplement  these  recommendations, the  Government,  together\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore Pools, has committed $500 million  over  five\r\n\r\nyears  to  sports.   Could the Minister give  us  a  progress\r\n\r\nreport on the implementation of these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40  recommendations?  How successful have we been  in  moving\r\n\r\ntowards  our  \"Sports For Everyone\" objective of achieving  a\r\n\r\nsports participation rate of one in every two Singaporeans by\r\n\r\nthe  year  2005?  In \"Sports Excellence\", what measures  have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken to ensure that we stand a good chance of emerging\r\n\r\none of the top 10 sporting nations in Asia by 2010?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our efforts to promote \"Sports Excellence\" and\r\n\r\n\"Sports For Everyone\", I would also like to urge the Minister\r\n\r\nnot to overlook the sporting needs for the disabled.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nmore  grants  could  be  provided for  the  Singapore  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil  for  the  disabled.   Our  disabled  sportsmen   and\r\n\r\nsportswomen  appear  to  be  bringing  home  more  medals  in\r\n\r\ninternational  meets  compared to our  able-bodied  athletes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  more  of our sports facilities should  be  disable-friendly, and the future sports school should admit promising\r\n\r\ndisabled athletes in order that they, too, can realise  their\r\n\r\nfull sporting potential.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir,  MCDS has set two very challenging objectives:  (1)   By\r\n\r\n2010, Singapore will be one of the top 10 sporting nations in\r\n\r\nAsia;  (2)   50%  of Singapore citizens could  take  part  in\r\n\r\nsports activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can formulate some strategies to fulfil these\r\n\r\nobjectives, I think we can achieve the objective of  becoming\r\n\r\none  of  the  10 sporting nations in Asia or the  third  best\r\n\r\nsporting  nation in Southeast Asia. There are many  countries\r\n\r\nin  Asia,  such  as  China, India, Japan,  Korea,  Australia,\r\n\r\nTaiwan  and  Hong Kong which are very strong in  sports,  and\r\n\r\ncertainly stronger than Singapore in this aspect.   Thailand,\r\n\r\nVietnam  and  Malaysia  are the strong  sporting  nations  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asian countries.  In order for us to  achieve  the\r\n\r\nobjective of becoming one of the 10 sporting nations in Asia,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  be  in the top 3 positions in  Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I attended a SEA Game in Malaysia. I found\r\n\r\nthat the standard of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsports   in  the  Southeast  Asian  countries  has   improved\r\n\r\nsignificantly. I am sure we are all familiar with  the  story\r\n\r\nof  the  tortoise  and  the hare. If  the  tortoise  is  well\r\n\r\nprepared  and perseveres all the way, he will beat  the  lazy\r\n\r\nhare  who  relaxes  in  mid-stream. Therefore,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve the objective laid down by the MCDS to become one  of\r\n\r\nthe top 10 in Asia, I have two suggestions to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Singapore Sports Council should meet up with\r\n\r\nall the National Sports Associations to find out what are the\r\n\r\nreasons for their inability to excel.  Athletes and sportsmen\r\n\r\nshould discuss ways to improve their skills and techniques to\r\n\r\nbring  out  their best performance.  Second, we should  award\r\n\r\nscholarships to our sportsmen and sportswomen, sportsboys and\r\n\r\nsportsgirls  to  go  overseas for  further  studies,  and  to\r\n\r\nreceive  professional  training  there,  in  order  to   have\r\n\r\nbreakthroughs in their respective sports. Then, we may have a\r\n\r\ngood  chance of fulfilling our objective of becoming  one  of\r\n\r\nthe top 10 sporting nations in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, in the budget for MCDS, there is\r\n\r\nan  allocation  of  $21.8 million for the  sports  and  youth\r\n\r\nprogramme. According to the budget, this money is mainly  for\r\n\r\nthe  implementation  of the Committee on  Sporting  Singapore\r\n\r\nProgramme.  I would like the Minister to enlighten the  House\r\n\r\nas to the details of the sports and youth programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the recommendations of the CoSS, the\r\n\r\nGovernment agreed to give a grant of $500 million to  promote\r\n\r\nsports  to  be  spread over five years.   I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  inform the House how much of this  money  comes\r\n\r\nfrom   Singapore  Pools,  and  how  much  is  actually   from\r\n\r\nGovernment funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, one of the pillars for the\r\n\r\nvision  of  a  sporting Singapore is \"Sports  for  Everyone\".\r\n\r\nStatistics  have shown that adults who take up  sports  start\r\n\r\nwhen  they are young. To achieve this vision, we must put  in\r\n\r\nresources to get our children active when they are in school.\r\n\r\nPresently, there is this stark\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmissing  link.  We are not reaching out to the young  in  the\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose the setting up of an Inter-Ministry Committee for sports for everyone and excellence for\r\n\r\nour  school children by the Education Ministry and the  MCDS.\r\n\r\nThere is a nice fit.  MCDS has the vision, the expertise  and\r\n\r\nthe  funding,  especially the facilities,  but  MOE  has  the\r\n\r\nstudents,  that  is MCDS' target customers.  Without  working\r\n\r\nclosely  with the caregivers of the students, the  principals\r\n\r\nand  the  teachers,  MCDS would not  be  able  to  reach  the\r\n\r\nstudents to encourage an active sports lifestyle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lack of sporting facilities in schools.\r\n\r\nSchools  have limited spaces so they would only pick the  few\r\n\r\nsports  which  they have the facilities.   In  my  daughter's\r\n\r\nschool  I  observe they play soft tennis in the school  hall,\r\n\r\nabout  30-40  students  at one time, congested  with  a  long\r\n\r\nwaiting  queue  to just hit the ball.  Within one  hour,  the\r\n\r\npoor  kid  is  only able to hit about three rounds  of  three\r\n\r\nballs each.  They cannot even enjoy the game, the sun and the\r\n\r\nfeeling  of  perspiration.   So  how  do  we  achieve  sports\r\n\r\nexcellence?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should tap on the community facilities among the\r\n\r\nschools.  For  example, the CCs could bring in  the  regional\r\n\r\nsports and fitness facilities nearer to the community so that\r\n\r\nstudents   could   tap   on  these   facilities   with   less\r\n\r\ntransportation   problems.   We  could  also   identify   the\r\n\r\ncommunity facilities and have a central booking system  where\r\n\r\nthe   regional  sports  office  could  manage  so  that   all\r\n\r\norganisations in the community could fully maximise  the  use\r\n\r\nof these facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a lack of sports facilitators and\r\n\r\ncoordinators.   The teachers are doubling up these  roles  in\r\n\r\nschools.   Some  do  not  even  know  the  sports  they   are\r\n\r\ncoordinating.  Let me quote my personal experience.  In  view\r\n\r\nof   the   shortage  of  teacher  coordinators,   a   teacher\r\n\r\ncoordinator asked a Primary 3 student to learn from a page of\r\n\r\n30-40  questions and then take a 10-question  test  paper  in\r\n\r\norder to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  eligible to become a student scout.  The answers given by\r\n\r\nthe  student  must  be perfect, with the capital  letters  in\r\n\r\nplace.   MCDS  could  support these  schools  with  trainers,\r\n\r\ncoaches or sports volunteers who know the games.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should expand the concept of volunteers into the\r\n\r\nsports  arena.   MCDS has done a great job for volunteers  in\r\n\r\nsocial  and community work itself.  We should extend this  to\r\n\r\nthe  sports arena.  I thereby urge the adoption of an  Inter-Ministry  approach to provide for an integrated  approach  to\r\n\r\nsports  for everyone and excellence, especially to the school\r\n\r\nchildren and to lay the foundation for excellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, in our effort to promote sports\r\n\r\nfor everyone and to achieve our objective of one in every two\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  being involved in sports, we must  ensure  that\r\n\r\nsports complexes are available as basic infrastructure in all\r\n\r\nour  HDB  housing estates where the majority of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nlive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sporting complexes should have, as a basic\r\n\r\nrequirement, facilities for track and field, an indoor sports\r\n\r\nhall and a swimming pool. Facilities that can be utilised  by\r\n\r\nas  many  residents  as possible, such as  a  swimming  pool,\r\n\r\nshould take priority over facilities that only a few can  use\r\n\r\nat any one time, such as a tennis court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister consider ensuring that all our HDB\r\n\r\nhousing estates, including Pasir Ris New Town, have a  sports\r\n\r\ncomplex with at least the basic facilities mentioned earlier?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, to be a\r\n\r\nsporting  nation,  we  need to have  the  appropriate  sports\r\n\r\ninfrastructure in Singapore.

Some  of\r\n\r\nthe  designs or facilities are obsolete while others  require\r\n\r\nimmediate  upgrading.   We need to develop  a  Masterplan  to\r\n\r\nupgrade and rebuild our sports complexes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore should aim to host more world sports\r\n\r\nevents.

They range from the\r\n\r\nformer Malaysia Cup to even the recent Singapore Rugby 7.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kallang area indeed contains some of the symbols of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore heartbeat that we are striving to build so that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans can identify with.  In the Budget debate in  the\r\n\r\nHouse  here  last year, in your capacity as the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development and Sports then, you  told  the  House\r\n\r\nthat the Government intends to redevelop the National Stadium\r\n\r\ninto an integrated sports hub which will provide Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwith  a world-class venue to watch top level sports, as  well\r\n\r\nas provide excellent facilities for sports participation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Kallang area has historical heritage value for\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  is  used  for  a  wide  variety  of  sporting\r\n\r\nactivities for the participation of both the young  and  old.\r\n\r\nIt  is an area where Singaporeans could use and develop their\r\n\r\nsports  talents and yet be a good venue for healthy lifestyle\r\n\r\npursuits and family recreation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am given to understand that commercially, land use in\r\n\r\nthe  Kallang  area, as calculated by MOF and  URA,  may  have\r\n\r\nbetter yield from other uses besides sports, especially  with\r\n\r\nthe  proposed location of the new MRT line there.

Over the last 10 years, 514\r\n\r\nlives were lost through drowning.  Drowning can be attributed\r\n\r\nto  a number of reasons, such as the design of waterways  and\r\n\r\npools, management of water facilities, and the knowledge  and\r\n\r\nskills  of  users.  But drowning can be prevented  if  proper\r\n\r\ntraining and measures were undertaken by the authorities, the\r\n\r\nwater  facility  operators and the people.  Experiences  from\r\n\r\nother  countries have proven that drowning prevention efforts\r\n\r\nhave  been  successful in saving lives.  One key strategy  in\r\n\r\ndrowning prevention is to promote the understanding of  water\r\n\r\nsafety among our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, water thrills, but it can kill if you do not\r\n\r\nunderstand   water   and  its  dangers.   Sadly,   not   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans understand water and water safety. That  is  why\r\n\r\nwe  often  read  about drowning cases in the  papers.   These\r\n\r\ndrownings  can be prevented. For example, if a  child  cannot\r\n\r\nswim, he should not be allowed to be in a wave pool or should\r\n\r\nat  least  wear  a life jacket, in addition to  a  buoy  when\r\n\r\nplaying  in  a wave pool. Wave pools are designed for  strong\r\n\r\nswimmers to have fun, and they are dangerous to weak or  non-swimmers.  The simple lack of such knowledge will  cause  the\r\n\r\nloss of lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to help reduce drowning in Singapore, I would\r\n\r\nlike to urge the Minister to take the lead in spearheading  a\r\n\r\nwater  safety  or drowning prevention campaign in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis   programme  should  reach  out  to  all   Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nincluding  domestic maids.  Sir, I wish to ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nthe following questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the Ministry's plan to increase water\r\n\r\nsafety knowledge and skills among Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Can the Ministry form a committee to review the\r\n\r\nwater safety measures in our pools and beaches?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the plans to prevent further drowning in\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, just to alert Dr Teo,\r\n\r\nhe  asked what the Minister is going to do to take the  lead.\r\n\r\nI just want to inform him that the Minister cannot swim, so I\r\n\r\nam not sure whether I can take the lead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Charles Chong has asked about the progress in\r\n\r\nimplementing  our sporting plan.  Mr Ang Mong Seng  has  also\r\n\r\nasked about our plans to achieve our sports excellence target\r\n\r\nwhich  is for Singapore to be among the top sporting  nations\r\n\r\nin  Asia  by  the year 2010.  Allow me to give the  House  an\r\n\r\nupdate.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government committed an additional $500\r\n\r\nmillion  over five years to our Sporting Singapore Plan,  and\r\n\r\nthis  was allocated to three broad areas:  Sports Excellence;\r\n\r\nSports for All; and the sports industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our aim in Sports Excellence is that Singaporean\r\n\r\nathletes should be able to compete against the very  best  in\r\n\r\nAsia  by  2010.   We  have a number of initiatives  from  the\r\n\r\nSporting Plan to achieve this, but let me just address  three\r\n\r\nof these key areas which have made some progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first, as Members would have rightly noted, is the\r\n\r\nsetting up of the Sports School which will be operational  in\r\n\r\n2004.   This  is  one  of  the major recommendations  in  the\r\n\r\nSporting  Singapore blueprint.  The Singapore  Sports  School\r\n\r\nwill  have a high standard of sports training.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  it  will  have a very flexible academic  curriculum  to\r\n\r\ncater to the training and the competition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschedules of the students.  This will ensure that the student\r\n\r\nathletes  will have access to quality education,  even  while\r\n\r\nthey  train.   The  Sports  School  will  also  be  admitting\r\n\r\ntalented, disabled student athletes, who can integrate in the\r\n\r\nmainstream  school system.  Graduates from  the  school  will\r\n\r\nform  a  significant part of the base of the future  sporting\r\n\r\ntalent  that  will  help us to achieve our Sports  Excellence\r\n\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second initiative, which was also touched by Mr Ang\r\n\r\nMong  Seng, is that the Singapore Sports Council is currently\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  a comprehensive review of the National  Sports\r\n\r\nAssociations   (NSAs).   This  review  will  help   establish\r\n\r\nstrategic directions, targets, as well as key programmes  for\r\n\r\nthe NSAs.  Increased support in funding and manpower will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  deserving NSAs so that they will  be  much  better\r\n\r\nequipped, to not only promote their sport to the masses,  but\r\n\r\nalso to select and develop elite athletes in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third key measure is a comprehensive support package\r\n\r\nfor  the  training  of  all national athletes.   Elite  level\r\n\r\nsporting  performance  requires  dedication,  commitment   of\r\n\r\nathletes  for  a  very  long period of  time.   SSC  has  put\r\n\r\ntogether the Athlete Career and Training Scheme (ACT),  which\r\n\r\nis  a customised and enhanced support package to enable elite\r\n\r\nathletes to commit to full-time training, either locally,  or\r\n\r\noverseas,  for a period of 2-4 years.  Some of  our  swimmers\r\n\r\nare now overseas under this programme.  This package includes\r\n\r\nliving  allowance,  training grants, study  grants,  coaching\r\n\r\nfees, and training and competition expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the three key measures, my Ministry and the\r\n\r\nSSC  are  also reviewing what we call the \"Sports  Excellence\r\n\r\nDelivery  System\".   This  will  cover  issues  like   talent\r\n\r\nidentification, youth development, sports science and  sports\r\n\r\nmedicine, career counselling and planning, and the developing\r\n\r\nof   expertise   of   coaches  and   officials.    With   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the current, and possibly new  initiatives,\r\n\r\nwe  are confident that we will be able to compete against the\r\n\r\nbest in Asia by 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second area of Sports for All, I am pleased to\r\n\r\nreport  that the sports participation rate has improved  from\r\n\r\n24% in 1992 to 38% in 2002.  I would just highlight two areas\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  focusing  on to help  us  improve  the  sports\r\n\r\nparticipation rate.  The first, of course, relates to  sports\r\n\r\ncomplexes  managed  by  the SSC.  Mr Charles  Chong  and  Mdm\r\n\r\nCynthia  Phua, both asked whether sports complexes  could  be\r\n\r\nprovided  at  more locations.  Dr Teo Ho Pin has  also  asked\r\n\r\nabout  our  plans to upgrade and rebuild some of  our  sports\r\n\r\ncomplexes in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the SSC's masterplan for Sports Facilities,\r\n\r\nSingapore is divided into 13 sports zones.  Each sports  zone\r\n\r\nhas  a population size of about 200,000, and should enjoy  at\r\n\r\nleast  an  outdoor running track, a football field, a  sports\r\n\r\nhall, a swimming complex and a tennis and squash centre.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, Sir, in the Pasir Ris New Town, which is within the\r\n\r\nChangi-Pasir  Ris  Tampines sports zone, it  has  a  swimming\r\n\r\ncomplex  and  a sports hall at Tampines Avenue 5,  about  two\r\n\r\nkilometres  from Pasir Ris New Town.  But, Sir,  the  SSC  is\r\n\r\nconsidering building another sports hall and a tennis  centre\r\n\r\nat Pasir Ris New Town.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In setting out these guidelines, the SSC has to take\r\n\r\ninto  account the cost effectiveness of operating the  sports\r\n\r\ncomplexes.  The SSC is currently reviewing the masterplan for\r\n\r\nfacilities  up  to  the year 2010.  Among other  things,  the\r\n\r\nreview  will look into the adequacy of our sports facilities,\r\n\r\ntypes of facilities to be provided, as well as the upgrading,\r\n\r\nrebuilding, or phasing out of older facilities.  This  review\r\n\r\nwill  therefore look at how sports facilities can  be  better\r\n\r\npatronised   by   integrating  them  with   other   community\r\n\r\nfacilities,  and  how the cost of operations  of  the  sports\r\n\r\ncomplexes  can  be  minimised.  SSC will  endeavour  to  seek\r\n\r\nfeedback   from  various  sources,  such  as  the  users   of\r\n\r\nfacilities,  grassroots organisations, as they undertake  the\r\n\r\nreview.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Mdm Cynthia Phua that the shared use\r\n\r\nof  the  facilities is the way forward and  we  have  started\r\n\r\nworking in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  direction.   For instance, to address the  shortage  of\r\n\r\nplaying  fields,  the SSC and the Ministry of  Education  are\r\n\r\nembarking on a pilot scheme to share school fields within the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Under the pilot scheme, seven school fields would\r\n\r\nbe  opened up for community use outside curriculum time.  The\r\n\r\nSSC  will  maintain these fields, and manage the use  of  the\r\n\r\nplaying fields, after schooling hours.  Concurrently, we  are\r\n\r\nalso  opening  up temporary vacant lots of land  for  use  as\r\n\r\ninterim  sports  fields.   Two  of  such  sites  will  become\r\n\r\navailable  shortly,  one at Ubi Avenue 1  and  the  other  at\r\n\r\nMarina  South.  With these new initiatives we hope to  create\r\n\r\nmore opportunities for Singaporeans to enjoy the benefits  of\r\n\r\nsports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area that we are focusing to promote Sports\r\n\r\nFor  All  is to expand, and strengthen our network of  sports\r\n\r\npartners.   The  idea  is  to multiply  our  efforts  through\r\n\r\nencouraging  more  sports partners  to  support  and  deliver\r\n\r\nsports  programmes.  Mdm Cynthia Phua has suggested  a  joint\r\n\r\ncommittee between MCDS and MOE so that we can promote  sports\r\n\r\namong the students.  I would like to inform her that we  have\r\n\r\nstarted a programme with the schools to encourage the schools\r\n\r\nto  hire  trainers,  to help those who  are  not  the  school\r\n\r\nathletes to participate in sporting activities.  Well over 30\r\n\r\nschools are now involved.  With a bit of funding from the SSC\r\n\r\nthey are now able to open up sporting opportunities for those\r\n\r\nwho  otherwise would not be involved in sports.  And this  is\r\n\r\nbest  left to the schools to decide.  Some of them have  even\r\n\r\nengaged  the  parents of the students as  trainers.   In  one\r\n\r\nparticular  school I visited, the mothers were very  actively\r\n\r\ninvolved  in some of the sporting events together with  their\r\n\r\nchildren  and  the  trainers, to  ensure  that  the  children\r\n\r\ncontinue to participate in some of these sporting events.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial support, as I mentioned, Sir, where\r\n\r\napplicable, will be provided to these partners.   With  their\r\n\r\nnew  role as facilitator and catalyst, the SSC also hopes  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  more coordinated approach to the planning of  sports\r\n\r\nprogrammes and competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has also asked about the support for\r\n\r\nthe  disabled sports.  I want to assure him that  the  sports\r\n\r\nagencies, representing the disabled sports in Singapore, will\r\n\r\nalso be part of the network which I have just mentioned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third pillar is sports industry. The Singapore\r\n\r\nSporting  Plan also called for the development  of  a  sports\r\n\r\nindustry.   I  wish to report that we have been working  very\r\n\r\nclosely  with the Singapore Tourism Board, as sports  tourism\r\n\r\nis  one  of  the key pillars of the sports industry.   In  FY\r\n\r\n2001,  we  organised a number of prestigious sporting  events\r\n\r\nwhich  proved  to  be  popular  with  both  Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\ntourists.   Dr  Teo must have known this. We  had  Singapore-Manchester United and Singapore-Liverpool matches, as well as\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Rugby  7, which was  just  recently  held  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Sir, our aim is to have a range  of  prestigious\r\n\r\nsports  events that are commercially viable and are  able  to\r\n\r\nhelp establish Singapore as a regional hub for sports events.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSC has also formed a sports marketing team to build up\r\n\r\nits  sports industry capabilities.  In time, Sir, we hope  to\r\n\r\nbe able to nurture sports related enterprises as the industry\r\n\r\ngrows.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tan Soo Khoon has drawn our attention to the\r\n\r\nbudget on youth and sports.  The $21.8 million is part of the\r\n\r\n$500  million  Singapore Sporting Fund.  We are  tapping  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Sporting Fund to help schools in  terms  of  youth\r\n\r\ndevelopment  for  sports.  In fact, in our arrangements  with\r\n\r\nthe  NSAs, one of the key items in the NSAs is that  we  want\r\n\r\nthem to have a youth development programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, Mr Tan has also asked how much of the\r\n\r\n$500  million comes from Singapore Pools.  I wish  to  inform\r\n\r\nthe  House that $375 million, or 75% of the money, is donated\r\n\r\nby Singapore Pools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Chew Heng Ching both asked\r\n\r\nabout the redevelopment plans of the National Stadium.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment has agreed, in principle, to replace the  National\r\n\r\nStadium  with  a multi-purpose sports hub, which  is  also  a\r\n\r\nmajor  recommendation  of the Sporting  Singapore  blueprint.\r\n\r\nThe  present National Stadium at Kallang, which was built  in\r\n\r\n1973,  is  now  inadequate for our objective of developing  a\r\n\r\nsports  industry.  The sports stadia of today are  no  longer\r\n\r\nbuilt  just  for sports alone.  They are designed for  multi-purpose   use,  with  facilities  such  as  retail   outlets,\r\n\r\nrestaurants, hotels, to attract customers to the stadium,  on\r\n\r\na daily basis.  It is therefore important that we upgrade the\r\n\r\nNational  Stadium  as  it is a vital  infrastructure  to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our sports industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of a new sports hub will give Singapore\r\n\r\nthe edge to compete with the world's best in attracting major\r\n\r\nsporting  events.   Besides being  a  world-class  venue  for\r\n\r\nsports  and  entertainment event, it will also  be  a  unique\r\n\r\nlifestyle centre with sports as a major theme, and an icon in\r\n\r\nthe  landscape of Singapore.  As Mr Chew has rightly  pointed\r\n\r\nout, there is a new MRT station running nearby, that could be\r\n\r\nintegrated in the plans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has engaged a team of consultants to conduct\r\n\r\na  feasibility  study of this project.  The study  will  look\r\n\r\ninto  issues such as the possible location of the sports hub.\r\n\r\nWe  still  have to find out what is the best type  of  sports\r\n\r\nfacilities  to include, possible events we could  stage,  and\r\n\r\nthe  business  models which we use to ensure its  operational\r\n\r\nviability.  Sir, we aim to submit our recommendations to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment by the end of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of water safety, Dr Teo has asked what\r\n\r\nare the water safety measures for the prevention of drowning.\r\n\r\nI  remarked  earlier  that  I do not  swim,  but  I  am  also\r\n\r\nconcerned  about drowning because my two young  children  are\r\n\r\nalso  learning  how  to swim.  The Singapore  Sports  Council\r\n\r\noperates  28  public  swimming complexes  in  Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nemploys qualified lifeguards to ensure water safety for these\r\n\r\npools.  The SSC also trains lifeguards, conducts water safety\r\n\r\nrelated  courses, and run \"Learn to Swim\" programmes for  the\r\n\r\ngeneral public.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntotal  expenditure on all water safety related activities  is\r\n\r\napproximately $6.1 million per annum.  SSC has  introduced  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of water safety measures including a \"Learn to  Swim\"\r\n\r\nscheme  to  teach non-swimmers to swim.  As of 31st  December\r\n\r\n2001,  more  than  222,000 people have participated  in  this\r\n\r\nprogramme.   The  SSC  also  started  the  National  Survival\r\n\r\nSwimming  Awards  (NASSA) scheme in 1979,  to  promote  water\r\n\r\nsafety knowledge and survival swimming skills.  To date, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  has produced more than 250,000 people  who  have\r\n\r\nundergone  proficiency tests.  The NASSA scheme is  currently\r\n\r\npromoted through 55 test centres, with more than 400  testers\r\n\r\nand  swimming instructors supporting the scheme.   The  NASSA\r\n\r\nsyllabus was reviewed and revised last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, SSC collaborated with the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation   who   launched  the  NASSA   Excellence   Schools\r\n\r\nPerformance Award (ESPA) and Water Safety Enrichment modules.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to enable secondary school students to learn  about\r\n\r\nwater  safety  knowledge and survival swimming skills  within\r\n\r\nthe  school curriculum hours.  Dr Teo, as the Chairman of the\r\n\r\nNASSA  Advisory  Committee, has said recently  in  the  press\r\n\r\nconference  that  there  were  plans  to  extend  the   NASSA\r\n\r\nExcellence  Schools  Performance Award  to  primary  schools.\r\n\r\nSir, we are supportive of this and glad that he is helping to\r\n\r\nraise  the  awareness of water survival  skills  amongst  our\r\n\r\nstudents.  The SSC is also working closely with the Singapore\r\n\r\nLife  Saving Society (SLSS), to promote water safety  through\r\n\r\nthe  NASSA  scheme by producing publicity materials  such  as\r\n\r\nposters and brochures to educate members of the public.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  SSC  will continue to train and educate members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  on  water  safety to prevent  drowning  incidents  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  My Ministry will look into Dr Teo's suggestion of\r\n\r\nforming  a  committee to review the water safety measures  in\r\n\r\nour pools and beaches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered most of the queries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I propose to take the break now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and\r\n\r\ntook the Chair of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Now, the Muslims are\r\n\r\nentering  an era with greater challenges.  So, MUIS needs  to\r\n\r\nmake  some refinements for the good of the community and  the\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Internet age, there are groups that desire to\r\n\r\nextend  their  influence around the globe.  Muslims  here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are not exempted.  But, what worries me are  groups\r\n\r\nthat  try  to  abuse  the religion for  political  and  other\r\n\r\npurposes.   They  desire to spread extremism  and  militancy.\r\n\r\nThis can be troublesome to all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want external elements to influence local\r\n\r\nMuslims  by  breeding extreme attitudes and stand that  could\r\n\r\ntarnish  the good name of our Muslims and affect  the  inter-racial  and inter-religious harmony here.  The arrest of  the\r\n\r\nJemaah  Islamiyah members was a clear example.   We  need  to\r\n\r\ntake  a  firm  stand  so  that such occurrence  will  not  be\r\n\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe MUIS should take appropriate steps to help the\r\n\r\nMuslims  in  this  country to maintain  the  correct  Islamic\r\n\r\nattitude  and  behaviour, which is  to  be  moderate  in  all\r\n\r\nthings.  Extremism has no place in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIslam,  worse still, any activity  involving  terrorism.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  believe that Muslims should be in the forefront  in\r\n\r\nthe fight against extremist activities, especially those that\r\n\r\ninvolve terrorism.  The Muslim community should instead be  a\r\n\r\npillar in promoting all good values and in developing healthy\r\n\r\nrelations among people, regardless of race or religion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that local Muslims are very concerned because\r\n\r\nthere  are some external groups which are damaging  the  good\r\n\r\nname  of  Islam by using religion as a tool in their campaign\r\n\r\nof  terror and militancy. They claim to be Muslims, yet their\r\n\r\nactions are all contrary to Islamic values and teachings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that if all Muslims in this country could\r\n\r\nstrengthen  their belief that Islam is all about  moderation,\r\n\r\nand it teaches its followers moderation, it would not be easy\r\n\r\nfor  any outside group to sway them to the wrong path. As  we\r\n\r\nequip  ourselves based on the do's and don'ts of Islam,  even\r\n\r\nif  there are attempts by external elements, we would be able\r\n\r\nto reject extremism and deviations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested to know how MUIS can help our Muslims to\r\n\r\nstay  on  course  with  the correct  Islamic  teachings  that\r\n\r\npromote  peace and harmony.  Can MUIS do more to ensure  that\r\n\r\nwrong and deviationist teachings will not take root here?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under AMLA, it is known that there are provisions\r\n\r\nto appoint a Mufti in Singapore and also the establishment of\r\n\r\na   Fatwa   Committee.   This  is  because   of   the   heavy\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Mufti and the Fatwa Committee to stress\r\n\r\nthe stand on issues regarding Islamic regulations and laws in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to be used as a guideline for Muslims here.   This\r\n\r\nis  a  highly respected institution in the Muslim  community.\r\n\r\nThe  views or decisions taken by the Mufti or Fatwa Committee\r\n\r\nare  used in guiding the Muslim community.  This has  been  a\r\n\r\nlong  tradition,  maybe  hundreds of  years,  in  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity,  and  I  see this system has  proceeded  smoothly.\r\n\r\nHowever, with this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem, it does not mean that people who have differing views\r\n\r\ncannot  give their opinions. It has been a tradition  in  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community  whereby those  who  are  learned  and  are\r\n\r\nscholars in the religious field should feel that it is  their\r\n\r\nresponsibility to give their views  to the Mufti or the Fatwa\r\n\r\nCommittee,  if there are certain aspects that they  find  not\r\n\r\nvery  accurate  and  sufficient attention  is  not  given  to\r\n\r\ncertain matters by the Fatwa Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Maidin, could you wind up your speech,\r\n\r\nplease?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Malay): This should be done in writing to the Mufti\r\n\r\nand  not  to  the  press  that could lead  to  confusion  and\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding.  This is especially so  if  there  are  too\r\n\r\nmany  groups giving their views on certain issues and I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister if there are still opportunities for\r\n\r\nthe religious scholars and teachers to give their views.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I wish there were more\r\n\r\nMembers  in  the  House because halal cuts  can  be  just  as\r\n\r\nsumptuous!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut on MUIS, Sir. Why cut now?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS or the Islamic Religious Council's role in\r\n\r\nsecular  Singapore is unique.  Singapore may be  secular  but\r\n\r\neven  that  brand  of  secularism  is  unique.   I  call  it:\r\n\r\nsecularism  with  a soul.  The tudung issue  notwithstanding,\r\n\r\nSingapore is not anti-religion.  In fact, religion is allowed\r\n\r\nto play its role in forging a harmonious and cohesive society\r\n\r\nin  our  Singapore.   After all, MUIS is a  statutory  board,\r\n\r\nappearing under the MCDS' care and budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the cut, yes, the budget cut, I was surprised to\r\n\r\nsee a 4% dip in Government grants to MUIS.  I do realise that\r\n\r\nMUIS  has  for  some time now been receiving a larger  income\r\n\r\nfrom its own zakat collection (tithes), but even that tap  is\r\n\r\nfacing a decrease, because of the economic downturn.  I  also\r\n\r\nrealise that there are quarters, though a minority, who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeel  that  MUIS  should  not bother  about  funds  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, for fear of being controlled, but I think that is\r\n\r\nbeing   myopic  and  to  the  detriment  of  the  community's\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS, identified by the PM as one of the key pillars for\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim  community  and which Minister  Yaacob  has  also\r\n\r\nhighlighted as a critical player to achieve his vision of the\r\n\r\nCommunity of Excellence, deserves all the help it can muster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially true, post September 11. The tasks\r\n\r\nahead  for  MUIS are even more formidable, both in forging  a\r\n\r\nclear  world view for the Malay/Muslim community and to  help\r\n\r\nit  uplift,  in the light of the new and changing world,  and\r\n\r\nalso   in   promoting   better   understanding   with   other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   MUIS  needs new tools  and  added  resources.\r\n\r\nMUIS needs to groom scholars who studied not just in Al Azhar\r\n\r\n(in  Cairo) and Makkah/Medina (in Saudi Arabia) but also from\r\n\r\nnew centres of Islamic learning in other more plural and open\r\n\r\nsocieties like Jordan, Morocco, or even in the US and Europe.\r\n\r\nStudies  in  Islamic tenets and jurisprudence are basic,  but\r\n\r\nequally   important  are  studies  of  contemporary   Islamic\r\n\r\nsocieties  and issues, including how they meet the challenges\r\n\r\nof  social  change, modernisation and living in  this  plural\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS needs all the resources to tackle these\r\n\r\nchallenges.  It should also engage scholars and intellectuals\r\n\r\nfrom other parts of the Muslim world to work with our leaders\r\n\r\nto  face  these tasks.  MUIS must also work closely with  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  religious  leaders on  issues  affecting  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is not the time for the community to be passive and\r\n\r\nself-defeating.   Neither  should the  community  be  finger-pointing   all  the  time.   The  community  does  itself   a\r\n\r\ndisservice by being insular.  It is time to look out  and  be\r\n\r\nbold  about the fresh changes that are taking place  in  this\r\n\r\nnew and different world.  The community must feel and act  as\r\n\r\nan  integrated  part of society in Singapore and  the  bigger\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing  a  Muslim  does  not make me less  a  Singaporean,  as\r\n\r\nanybody  else in this House.  The community has to  stand  up\r\n\r\nand  stand tall in being counted as moderates who believe  in\r\n\r\ntolerance,  working  together as a  team,  whether  to  fight\r\n\r\nterrorism  or  to build a better future for our children  and\r\n\r\ngrandchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, the arrests of 13 operatives of Jemaah Islamiyah is a\r\n\r\nserious wake-up call to most Singaporeans.  Not only did  the\r\n\r\nnews  make  Singaporeans  realise  how  real  the  threat  of\r\n\r\nterrorism  is,  it  also  highlighted  the  reality  of   how\r\n\r\nvulnerable we can be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the leader of the 13 arrested is a self-proclaimed religious leader sets a new dimension and presents\r\n\r\na    critical   challenge   to   Singapore.    Religion   has\r\n\r\ntraditionally  been  a  close and personal  matter  to  every\r\n\r\nindividual.   However,  events in the  world  have  suggested\r\n\r\nstrongly  that  it  is  no  longer a  personal  matter.   The\r\n\r\nsituation  is  critical  for a multi-religious  society  like\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every religion often presents its followers with a\r\n\r\nset  of  values and beliefs that they should embrace.   These\r\n\r\nare then translated into behaviours.  To some, religion is an\r\n\r\nabstract   phenomenon  that  is  difficult   to   understand.\r\n\r\nFollowers  look  up to religious teachers  for  guidance  and\r\n\r\ndirection,  especially  when they are  faced  with  difficult\r\n\r\ndecisions to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like teachers in academic schools, religious\r\n\r\nteachers  also  have the moral and ethical responsibility  to\r\n\r\nprovide  sound  teachings.  What  is  more  critical,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  is  that  religious teachers  must  understand  the\r\n\r\ncontext  in which its followers are practising the  religion.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore,  for  example, I think it  is  the  moral  and\r\n\r\nethical  responsibility of every religious  teacher  to  help\r\n\r\ntheir  respective  followers understand  and  practise  their\r\n\r\nreligions  within  the context of a multi-religious  society.\r\n\r\nThis  implies the need to place higher value to  the  greater\r\n\r\ngood  of society than the interest of the individual.   I  am\r\n\r\nsure that every religion aspires to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachieve  greater  good  for society that  its  followers  are\r\n\r\nliving in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is sufficient evidence around the world that show\r\n\r\nthe charisma of religious leaders can influence the behaviour\r\n\r\nof  his or her followers.  To this end, I would like to raise\r\n\r\nthe  issue of the qualification and registration of religious\r\n\r\nteachers  in Singapore.  We must set a mechanism in place  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  religious  teachers  who  conduct  classes   in\r\n\r\nSingapore are qualified and have the necessary qualification.\r\n\r\nThe recent incident of the JI operatives is an example of how\r\n\r\nthe  situation  may  be detrimental to the  security  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry and how it can threaten social cohesion and religious\r\n\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the group is a self-professed religious\r\n\r\nteacher  whose  qualification and credentials have  not  been\r\n\r\nestablished.   We are fortunate that the group  was  arrested\r\n\r\nbefore  any  mishaps could happen.  We cannot take  any  more\r\n\r\nchances.   In this case, may I ask the Minister-in-charge  of\r\n\r\nMuslim  Affairs  if MUIS has any plans to register  religious\r\n\r\nteachers  who  conduct classes for Muslims in  Singapore.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand that it will be an arduous task to do as there are\r\n\r\nmany classes that are taking place in residential homes.  The\r\n\r\nvalue,  however,  is  that the register  will  enable  Muslim\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  be  certain that they  are  indeed  getting\r\n\r\nreligious guidance from qualified teachers.  I feel  that  it\r\n\r\nis  better  if  the public is informed on what measures  that\r\n\r\ncould  be  taken  should they suspect a particular  religious\r\n\r\nteacher of improper teachings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier the critical point that religious\r\n\r\nteachers  should teach their respective religion  within  the\r\n\r\ncontext of our multi-racial and multi-religious society.   In\r\n\r\nthe  case  of the Muslim community, for example, we generally\r\n\r\nfind  that  many  of our religious teachers  are  trained  in\r\n\r\nuniversities in countries where the Muslim community are  the\r\n\r\nmajority.    Oftentimes,  they  learn  the   experience   and\r\n\r\npractices of these communities.  As the Muslim community here\r\n\r\nis a minority, situations and practices for the Muslims\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay be different here compared to countries where the Muslims\r\n\r\nare   a   majority.   Indeed,  there  are  minority   Islamic\r\n\r\ncommunities  of excellence in other parts of the  world.   In\r\n\r\nour  effort  at  attaining  the  vision  of  a  community  of\r\n\r\nexcellence,  may  I  suggest  that  MUIS  provide  attachment\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for  these  religious teachers  to  go  to  these\r\n\r\ncountries and understand how Islam is practised by a minority\r\n\r\ncommunity  par  excellence.  They can  then  bring  home  the\r\n\r\nwealth   of   experience  and  teach   the   community   more\r\n\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): One of MUIS'\r\n\r\nmajor successes has been in the implementation of the mosques\r\n\r\nbuilding  programme.  With the community's  contribution  and\r\n\r\nthe  collection  machinery  of  the  CPF  Board,  the  mosque\r\n\r\nbuilding  programme  has  been  our  meaningful  achievement.\r\n\r\nSince  the  first generation Muhajirin mosque was  built,  we\r\n\r\nhave   witnessed  increasing  improvements  in  quality   and\r\n\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it seems that many of these new mosques had to\r\n\r\nexpand  the space for prayers by fixing awnings or by  adding\r\n\r\nseveral floors to cater to various needs.  This requires more\r\n\r\nfunds.   The  result  is  that  many  of  these  mosques  are\r\n\r\ncontinuously  finding ways to raise funds.   In  fact,  there\r\n\r\nhave  been  occasions when several mosques compete  to  raise\r\n\r\nfunds at the same time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, many older mosques which are usually\r\n\r\nin  a  state of disrepair also need attention.  Over the past\r\n\r\nyears,  several older mosques had been rebuilt or were  given\r\n\r\nextensive  upgrading.   Each  project  requires  millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are some mosques that continue to\r\n\r\norganise  fund  raising projects even though their  upgrading\r\n\r\nwork  had been completed. They felt a need to raise funds  to\r\n\r\nsustain  other activities. I wish to know if the building  of\r\n\r\nnew  mosques  will be an on-going programme  or  will  it  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  within  a  certain  timeframe.   Can  the   Mosque\r\n\r\nBuilding Fund afford to build one new mosque within a year or\r\n\r\n18 months?  If not, will MUIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nencourage those who can afford it, to increase their  monthly\r\n\r\ncontributions?  As many Muslim workers have lost  their  jobs\r\n\r\nin  this  difficult  time, it will  have  an  impact  on  the\r\n\r\ncollection of this fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the building of new mosques can be completed within a\r\n\r\ncertain  timeframe, is there a possibility  that  the  Mosque\r\n\r\nBuilding Fund that is collected through the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund  Board  be allocated for the upgrading or rebuilding  of\r\n\r\nthe  old  mosques?  Aside from these, I understand that  many\r\n\r\nmosques in fact have large surpluses or savings.  Can we  set\r\n\r\naside, for instance, 10% of these funds, for the building  of\r\n\r\nnew mosques and the repair of the old ones?  As our resources\r\n\r\nare  limited,  I think we need to explore new  and  effective\r\n\r\nmeans  to  meet the needs of both our new and old mosques.  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister could clarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, compulsory\r\n\r\neducation  will  take  effect in  the  year  2003.   The  Act\r\n\r\nrecognises  the  importance of education  and  ensuring  that\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean  child  is given  ample  opportunities  to\r\n\r\neducation  in  our national schools.  Sir, we also  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  education  is  indeed  the  social  leveller  and   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to be able to survive in the knowledge  economy,\r\n\r\nthey  must possess a minimum level of education and a set  of\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students of full-time Islamic religious schools, or\r\n\r\nmadrasahs,  have  been given an exception on  condition  that\r\n\r\nthey  also sit for the PSLE examination and obtain a  minimum\r\n\r\ngrade.   I  believe that madrasah students and their  parents\r\n\r\nare  aware of the need for them to also be prepared  for  the\r\n\r\nnew  economy.   Whether they graduate and seek employment  in\r\n\r\nthe  religious  sector or other sectors,  the  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nskills-set  obtained will enhance their relevance and  indeed\r\n\r\nemployability in the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, running a school is no easy matter. It requires\r\n\r\nresources  and  expertise.  The focus of madrasahs  has  been\r\n\r\nreligious  education.  The inclusion of Mathematics,  English\r\n\r\nand  Science  in  their  curriculum  will  indeed  create   a\r\n\r\nchallenge for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmadrasahs.  In this regard, I would like to ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nin charge of Muslim Affairs the following questions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the level of PSLE result that the madrasah\r\n\r\nstudents  must  attain when compulsory education  comes  into\r\n\r\neffect?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How are the madrasahs gearing up in meeting up this\r\n\r\nnew  expectation?  Do the madrasahs have the needed resources\r\n\r\nand   expertise  to  prepare  their  children  for  the  PSLE\r\n\r\nexamination?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What is the role of MUIS in ensuring that the\r\n\r\nmadrasahs stay focused on providing religious education  and,\r\n\r\nat the same time, meeting the standards set?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) What is the role of MUIS in curriculum development\r\n\r\nin the madrasahs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Are there plans for the madrasahs to collaborate\r\n\r\nwith  the  national schools in terms of sharing of resources,\r\n\r\neg, use of science laboratories, etc?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs'\r\n\r\nvision of a community of excellence, the madrasahs should aim\r\n\r\nto  be an institution of excellence in the country and in the\r\n\r\nregion.   The  madrasahs will continue to serve an  important\r\n\r\nfunction  for  the  Muslim  community.   They  will   produce\r\n\r\ngenerations  of  religious  teachers  and  scholars  for  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also recognised, however, that not all madrasah\r\n\r\ngraduates will become religious scholars and teachers.   Some\r\n\r\nmay  be bankers, teachers, administrators, and so on.  I have\r\n\r\nseen  graduates  of madrasahs succeed in our  local  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  They are indeed role models for the others who\r\n\r\nhave  set  their eyes on tertiary education.  The  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  Act is a boost to these students as  they  acquire\r\n\r\nthe  requisite set of knowledge and skills.  It sets a  stage\r\n\r\nfor  madrasahs  to  succeed in attaining  the  vision  of  an\r\n\r\ninstitution of excellence.  I would like to encourage MUIS to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  play  an active role in helping  the  madrasahs\r\n\r\nexcel  in  its  work.   As  the religious  authority  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry, MUIS should set the directions for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmadrasahs and assist the madrasahs secure the resources  that\r\n\r\nthey need to achieve their mission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in taking the lead role on the development of the\r\n\r\nMuslim   scholars  in  Singapore,  MUIS  should  also   guide\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  and its students on training opportunities  abroad\r\n\r\nin  universities in countries where the Islamic community  is\r\n\r\nthe  minority community. This will provide greater  relevance\r\n\r\nto  the application of acquired knowledge when they return to\r\n\r\nSingapore  as religious teachers and scholars.   I  encourage\r\n\r\nMUIS  to  take a more proactive role in guiding the madrasahs\r\n\r\nand their students in this regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singapore is undergoing major changes in its\r\n\r\neconomic  and  social landscape, so do the other  social  and\r\n\r\nreligious institutions.

Many\r\n\r\norganisations  seem to be in constant need  to  raise  funds.\r\n\r\nShould  these organisations be required to raise funds  while\r\n\r\nthey  are  also  expected to provide  a  good  service?   And\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  constantly demanding even  higher  quality\r\n\r\nservice, even though they are in a group who needs help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Ministry ensure that our VWOs need not spend too\r\n\r\nmuch  time  worrying about fund raising so  that  they  could\r\n\r\naccord  more time and energy to excel further in the services\r\n\r\nthey  provide?  Can MCDS and the National Council  of  Social\r\n\r\nService assist our VWOs in this respect?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I also raise some of the issues of catering to\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of people who do not speak good English.   It  is\r\n\r\nwell known that some people can communicate best in their own\r\n\r\nlanguage, be it Chinese,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalay or Tamil.  Many of them speak broken English and  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  we  should expect them to explain  clearly  their\r\n\r\nproblems in English, especially to welfare workers.   Neither\r\n\r\nshould  we  expect them to understand clearly all the  advice\r\n\r\nand counselling if they are given only in English.\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I know if MCDS is working to cater to the needs\r\n\r\nof  these  people?   One  example is  those  who  are  Malay-speaking.  I have seen some of them who come to my  MPS,  and\r\n\r\nwhen  I  referred them to other agencies, they told  me  they\r\n\r\nhave tried and it is very difficult to communicate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that, in Singapore, many Malay families and youths\r\n\r\nare  also  facing social problems.  Yet, I am  not  convinced\r\n\r\nthat  there are enough provisions made by social agencies  to\r\n\r\ncater to them.  I hope the Minister can enlighten me.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I understand that the National\r\n\r\nCouncil   of   Social  Service  has  developed  a   programme\r\n\r\nevaluation  system  to  assess  VWOs'  programme  output  and\r\n\r\noutcome.   This,  I  also understand, has  resulted  in  some\r\n\r\nprogrammes  of VWOs not being funded.  I would like  to  know\r\n\r\nthe  objective  of  implementing such a system  and  how  the\r\n\r\nsystem  works.   I  would also like  to  know  what  are  the\r\n\r\ncriteria  of  the  evaluations,  and  under  what  evaluation\r\n\r\nresults would a particular programme not be funded.  How many\r\n\r\nprogrammes   have  been  disqualified  so   far   after   the\r\n\r\nevaluations and why are they disqualified?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern that such a system measures\r\n\r\nquantitative output of the service provided rather  than  the\r\n\r\nqualitative service.  So I would like to request the Minister\r\n\r\nto clarify this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I would like to thank\r\n\r\nall  the Members who have raised issues relating to MUIS  and\r\n\r\nthe  Malay-Muslim  community.  Let me take those  cuts  first\r\n\r\ntogether, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first respond to Mr Maidin's question on how\r\n\r\nMUIS,  a very important institution, can help our Muslims  to\r\n\r\nstay on course with the right Islamic values and beliefs  and\r\n\r\nguard  against deviant teachings.  Sir, MUIS is committed  to\r\n\r\nbuilding an exemplary Muslim community as an integral part of\r\n\r\nthe   multi-racial  and  multi-religious  Singapore  society.\r\n\r\nThere  are  a few important principles which MUIS  subscribes\r\n\r\nto.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Singapore Muslim community's experience has\r\n\r\nshown  that  Islam is consistent with progress.  Muslims  can\r\n\r\nprogress  in  tandem  with other communities  without  losing\r\n\r\ntheir religious identity.  Secondly, one can be a good Muslim\r\n\r\nand  a  good  citizen,  and  these  are  not  opposing  aims.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Muslims must reach out to other communities to build\r\n\r\nmutual  understanding and trust, and vice versa.  MUIS  plays\r\n\r\nan  important  role  in  helping to strengthen  bonds  across\r\n\r\ncommunities  and  presenting  the  religion  in   the   right\r\n\r\nperspective to both Muslims and non-Muslims, and  MUIS  leads\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim community in evolving the practice of  the  faith\r\n\r\nwhich is true to Islam and, more importantly, appropriate for\r\n\r\nmulti-racial and multi-religious Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS reaches out to Muslims in a number of ways. For\r\n\r\nexample,  through the weekly Friday sermons in  the  mosques,\r\n\r\nMuslims  are guided on the right religious values  and  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities to forge a better future for themselves, the\r\n\r\ncommunity  and the nation.  In another instance, as mentioned\r\n\r\nby  Mr  Maidin,  fatwas  or rulings which  serve  to  clarify\r\n\r\nIslamic jurisprudence are important in guiding Muslims on the\r\n\r\nsound practice of the Islamic faith.  Through fatwas, Muslims\r\n\r\nare  guided in the practical application of Islam in response\r\n\r\nto  emerging issues and developments in society.   The  Fatwa\r\n\r\nCommittee  is a very high-level committee which is  in  MUIS,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  chaired, rightly so, by the Mufti and  comprises\r\n\r\nIslamic  scholars with sound judgement and who have extensive\r\n\r\nexperience  in  Islamic jurisprudence.  Fatwas are  religious\r\n\r\nrulings and they are binding on the Muslim community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Maidin has asked whether there are opportunities for\r\n\r\ngroups  to express their opinions on the Fatwa Committee.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  inform  the  Member  that  the  channels  of\r\n\r\ncommunication  are  constantly open.   Groups  who  may  have\r\n\r\nopinions  on certain matters that they would like to  express\r\n\r\nare more than welcome to write to the office of the Mufti, or\r\n\r\nto express them through letters and use the MUIS website.  So\r\n\r\nthere  are  many opportunities which are open to  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  who may want to express some of their  views,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is something which we welcome.  In fact, MUIS,  on  its\r\n\r\nown  part, has set out to meet the various stakeholders, both\r\n\r\nwithin   the  Muslim  and  the  non-Muslim  communities,   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  further  some of their concerns,  and  these  are\r\n\r\ninputs  which will be fed back to the Fatwa Committee as  and\r\n\r\nwhen  an  issue  which is important to the  Muslim  community\r\n\r\nneeds  to be deliberated.  I would like to assure the  Member\r\n\r\nthat  the Fatwa Committee will not turn away any feedback  or\r\n\r\nany information that may be useful for their deliberations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the matter of religious teachers, we know that\r\n\r\nmany  Muslims  receive teaching and guidance  from  religious\r\n\r\nteachers.   MUIS  ensures that religious  teachers  are  well\r\n\r\nqualified  and  able  to guide Muslims appropriately  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext   of  multi-racial  Singapore.   MUIS,  for  example,\r\n\r\nconducts  training  and  orientation programmes  to  mosques,\r\n\r\nimams  or  religious leaders on the positive roles that  they\r\n\r\ncan  play in guiding the Muslim community towards growth  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   For  example, the \"Nadwah,  Imam  and  Khatib\"\r\n\r\n(NIK)   programme  is  a  platform  for  imams   to   discuss\r\n\r\ncontemporary  issues  and their implications  to  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity.   So there is a process of engaging  between  MUIS\r\n\r\nand  the  various religious leaders within the  community  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  they receive timely information and  understand\r\n\r\nsome of the important concerns at the national level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Mohamad Maliki has raised the issue of\r\n\r\nregistering  religious teachers.  MUIS maintains  a  list  of\r\n\r\nqualified religious teachers.  The list is being updated  and\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformation  will be made available on the  MUIS  website  in\r\n\r\nJuly this year.  This will enable the public to make informed\r\n\r\ndecisions when engaging religious teachers.  For parents  who\r\n\r\nare  keen  to  engage  private religious teachers  for  their\r\n\r\nchildren,  my advice, Sir, is to engage teachers who  are  on\r\n\r\nthe  MUIS  list.   MUIS ensures that all our  mosques  engage\r\n\r\nqualified  religious teachers on its list.  Other  providers,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Malay/Muslim  organisations and  private  education\r\n\r\ncentres,  also  provide religious classes to  complement  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of  the  mosques.  MUIS will look into  the  private\r\n\r\nservice  providers  market to ensure that the  standards  are\r\n\r\nalso maintained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS' public education effort this year will\r\n\r\npromote  greater understanding about Islam among non-Muslims,\r\n\r\nas  well  as  educating Muslims of the need for  balance  and\r\n\r\nmoderation  in practising their religious beliefs  in  multi-religious  Singapore.  MUIS and the mosques are  engaging  in\r\n\r\ngoodwill  visits,  talks,  joint activities  with  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations,  and organisations such as NTUC,  schools  and\r\n\r\nChinese clan associations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, together with the partners, MUIS will continue to\r\n\r\nundertake its full slate of religious development and  social\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  I would like to assure Mr Zainul Abidin  Rasheed\r\n\r\nthat  there is no cause for concern that good programmes will\r\n\r\nbe  curtailed  for lack of resources.  Funding for  the  MUIS\r\n\r\nadministration has increased steadily from 1998 to 2001.   In\r\n\r\n2002, because of the preceding year, where there was negative\r\n\r\ngrowth, the funding will be slightly adjusted downwards.  But\r\n\r\nI do not think there is cause for concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above the grant to cover MUIS administration,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has also, since 1999, provided MUIS  with  an\r\n\r\nannual matching grant of up to $1.3 million for programmes to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  Malay-Muslim families.  MUIS  has  also  seen  an\r\n\r\nincrease in zakat collections from $6 million in 1995 to  $14\r\n\r\nmillion  in  2001, due to greater awareness among Muslims  of\r\n\r\ntheir religious obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for full-time education conducted by madrasahs, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  assure  both Mdm Halimah,  who  raised  this\r\n\r\nquestion  earlier, and Dr Maliki, that MUIS and the madrasahs\r\n\r\nare working closely on preparations for compulsory education.\r\n\r\nThey  are  working  hard to ensure that  the  first  madrasah\r\n\r\ncohort to sit the PSLE in 2008 are adequately prepared and to\r\n\r\nreach  the benchmark of 175 at the PSLE level.  The  madrasah\r\n\r\ncurriculum  is  being  reviewed to improve  the  teaching  of\r\n\r\nIslamic   subjects  as  well  as  the  teaching  of  English,\r\n\r\nMathematics, Science and the mother tongue.  Curriculum  time\r\n\r\nfor  English,  Mathematics  and  Science  subjects  will   be\r\n\r\nincreased   without  diluting  the  teaching   of   religious\r\n\r\nsubjects.   The  madrasahs  have also  hired  more  qualified\r\n\r\nEnglish, Mathematics and Science teachers, and provided their\r\n\r\nteachers  with  training  to  improve  their  skills.    MUIS\r\n\r\nprovides financial assistance through the Madrasah Fund.  The\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  can  then  use these funds to  top  the  teachers'\r\n\r\nsalaries or go for teachers' training.  MUIS coordinates with\r\n\r\nMOE to ensure that the children who are unable to get a place\r\n\r\nin  the madrasahs when CE takes place, can still register for\r\n\r\nthe  national  schools.  MUIS and the madrasahs are  actively\r\n\r\nlooking  at  programmes to enable their students to  interact\r\n\r\nwith  students  of  other races and appreciate  the  national\r\n\r\nperspective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on some specific suggestions by Mr Zainul Abidin\r\n\r\nabout  how  we  should  continually engage  new  scholars  or\r\n\r\nscholars  from  different parts of  the  world  in  order  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  greater  understanding of  how  Islam  should  be\r\n\r\ncontextualised in the context of a multi-racial Singapore,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to assure the Member that we are constantly doing\r\n\r\nthat.   There  may not be a formal programme, but  there  are\r\n\r\nefforts to reach out to various scholars who are out there in\r\n\r\nthe Muslim world who have a better understanding of how Islam\r\n\r\nshould  develop in a multi-racial setting.  Last  year,  MUIS\r\n\r\nled  a  delegation to the US to meet some of the scholars  in\r\n\r\nAmerica  as  there is some similarity between the context  of\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim  minority  there  and  the  Muslim  minority   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I would like to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassure the Member that we will constantly be on the look-out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, at the same time, I believe that the Member will\r\n\r\nagree with me that we should be finding ways to develop  some\r\n\r\nindigenous capability within Singapore - scholars of our  own\r\n\r\nwho  are able to guide the Muslim community in a context that\r\n\r\nis ever-changing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has also suggested some very good ideas about\r\n\r\nattachment  programmes for our uztaz.  I would certainly  ask\r\n\r\nMUIS  to study that.  Personally, I think such exposure  will\r\n\r\nhelp   them   in   terms  of  understanding  how   Islam   is\r\n\r\ncontextualised in those areas which are similar to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has also asked what steps can Muslims take if\r\n\r\nthey  detect  that there are teachers who are teaching  Islam\r\n\r\nnot  in  the  correct manner.  I would urge  any  Muslims  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  if  they  come across such incidents,  the  first\r\n\r\nthing  they should do is to refer to the office of the  Mufti\r\n\r\nor  the  MUIS  website  and  we  will  follow  up  with  some\r\n\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Mosque Building Fund, Mr Maidin\r\n\r\nhas raised some very interesting suggestions.  First, let  me\r\n\r\ngive  an  update  on the mosque building programme  before  I\r\n\r\nanswer  specifically  some  of the  questions  raised  by  Mr\r\n\r\nMaidin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nineteen mosques have been built under the Mosque\r\n\r\nBuilding  Fund  programme  since its  launch  in  1975.   The\r\n\r\nbuilding  programme  for  mosques is  dovetailed  with  HDB's\r\n\r\nbuilding   programme.   Two  mosques  are   currently   under\r\n\r\nconstruction  - in Bukit Panjang and Sembawang  respectively.\r\n\r\nConstruction of a mosque in Bishan is expected  to  start  in\r\n\r\n2003.   I  am also pleased to announce that a mosque will  be\r\n\r\nbuilt in Sengkang new town.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In time to come, with the need for new mosques having\r\n\r\nbeen  largely met through the mosque building programme, MUIS\r\n\r\nwill  focus  more  on working with mosques to  upgrade  their\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mosque Building Fund is currently required to fund\r\n\r\nthe building of new mosques.  The current collection is about\r\n\r\n$3.5 million per year.  But the cost of a new mosque is about\r\n\r\n$10  million  and, therefore, it takes about three  years  of\r\n\r\ncollection  to  build  a new mosque.  Mr Maidin's  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  the Mosque Building Fund be used for mosque maintenance\r\n\r\nand upgrading work can be considered when the mosque building\r\n\r\nprogramme  is  completed, which it must one day.   The  older\r\n\r\nmosques  can  be  considered for upgrading first.   MUIS  can\r\n\r\nstudy  this and work with the mosques on the phasing  of  the\r\n\r\nupgrading programmes for the various mosques.  MUIS will also\r\n\r\nlook  into Mr Maidin's suggestion for mosque surpluses to  be\r\n\r\nused to help fund building and upgrading of mosques.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the matter of the role of MUIS with madrasah, a\r\n\r\npoint raised by Dr Maliki, I would like to assure him that we\r\n\r\nare in constant contact with madrasah operators in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  committee that is looking into  the  curriculum\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the  madrasah and, through  this  curriculum\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  we hope to address the concerns  raised  by  Mr\r\n\r\nMaidin that, in the teaching of Islam, we have to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  teachings are contextualised to the context in which our\r\n\r\nstudents  will  grow up as Singaporeans.  The development  of\r\n\r\nthe  curriculum will take that line.  We have commissioned  a\r\n\r\nconsultant to look into this.  It will take a number of years\r\n\r\nto  roll  out but I am sure, with time, we will  be  able  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  curriculum which is suited  to  our  needs  as  a\r\n\r\nminority here in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on the issue raised by Mr Maidin on\r\n\r\nVWOs.   Mr  Maidin  has  expressed  concern  about  Voluntary\r\n\r\nWelfare  Organisations (VWOs) having to  spend  time  raising\r\n\r\nfunds.   I  agree  with  him that this is  a  valid  concern,\r\n\r\nespecially  for  smaller VWOs.  That is why  we  set  up  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Chest.  It is there, set up to relieve VWOs of fund-raising  and to allow them to focus on the running  of  their\r\n\r\nservices.   VWOs  that  are  running  programmes  which   are\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  the  community can apply for funding  from  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Chest.  However, there are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVWOs  which choose to raise funds on their own.  I  encourage\r\n\r\nthem to partner one another and to share their resources.  To\r\n\r\nminimise  the  fund-raising burden and avoid  donor  fatigue,\r\n\r\nVWOs  should  set  reasonable fund-raising targets  based  on\r\n\r\ntheir needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Government support to VWOs, I have earlier\r\n\r\nhighlighted a $7 million increase in annual recurrent funding\r\n\r\nto  VWOs and, of course, the setting up of the VWO Capability\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund  of  $30  million  over  five  years.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  also introduced double  tax  deductions  for\r\n\r\napproved  donations.  So, I would like to assure  the  Member\r\n\r\nthat  my  Ministry places the highest importance on  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  our services are able to cater to Singaporeans who need\r\n\r\nthem regardless of language, race or religion.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, our social service agencies are\r\n\r\nresourceful  and  able  to  cater to  clients  with  specific\r\n\r\nlanguage  requirements.  I cited the example earlier  of  the\r\n\r\nMarine  Parade  FSC where well over 30% of  the  clients  are\r\n\r\nMalays and Malay-speaking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the instances where the agency staff are not able to\r\n\r\nspeak  the client's language, the agency taps on the  network\r\n\r\nof  volunteers or partners, such as self-help groups, to help\r\n\r\nin  the  translation and working with the clients.  The  VWOs\r\n\r\nalso send their staff for training which help them understand\r\n\r\nthe specific needs of the different communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above these social services that cater to all\r\n\r\nraces,  we  recognise  that  there  are  specific  needs   of\r\n\r\ndifferent  ethnic communities that require special attention.\r\n\r\nHence,  Government matching grants are given to the self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  to  look into programmes to help under-achievers  and\r\n\r\nother  niche  areas.   However, as  the  Prime  Minister  had\r\n\r\nindicated  recently,  self-help groups should  not  duplicate\r\n\r\nservices   provided  by  other  organisations,  but   instead\r\n\r\ncollaborate with or tap on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservices  of other providers. The partnership approach  would\r\n\r\nprevent  us  from  swinging  unwittingly  to  an  undesirable\r\n\r\nscenario,  where more and more social services and programmes\r\n\r\nare organised along ethnic lines.  At the end of the day, our\r\n\r\napproach  is for the social service agencies to work together\r\n\r\nwith  partners who can provide the expertise.  I am heartened\r\n\r\nby the experience of the various FSCs that I have visited and\r\n\r\nthey  are able to be resourceful and reach out to either  the\r\n\r\nCDCs  or  the  self-help groups to try and meet some  of  the\r\n\r\ndemands which are unique to the different communities here in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have answered most of the questions. I will now\r\n\r\nask my MOS, Mr Chan Soo Sen, to reply to Mr Low.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Sir, Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked\r\n\r\nabout the programme evaluation system applied to the VWOs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme evaluation system is like management by\r\n\r\nobjective  as  in  staff evaluation.  In the  case  of  staff\r\n\r\nevaluation,  the boss and the subordinate sit down  together,\r\n\r\nagree  on  certain performance indicators, and then based  on\r\n\r\nthese  performance  indicators, the  staff's  performance  is\r\n\r\nevaluated.   With this, there is a good understanding  as  to\r\n\r\nwhat is supposed to be achieved, to what extent all these are\r\n\r\nbeing achieved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme evaluation system is the same thing. The\r\n\r\nNCSS works together with the voluntary organisation concerned\r\n\r\nand  they  agree  on  a  certain set of programme  evaluation\r\n\r\ncriteria. At the end of a certain number of months, or at the\r\n\r\nend  of  each  year,  they will sit down  and  evaluate.  The\r\n\r\nprogramme evaluation system is not directly linked to funding\r\n\r\nin  the sense that it will not be as obvious as saying  that,\r\n\r\n\"Look, you only achieve 75% of your indicators and therefore,\r\n\r\nI  only  give you 75% of the funding\".  It is not like  that.\r\n\r\nPerformance   indicators  provide  a   common   currency   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  communication between the NCSS  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary organisation being evaluated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know of any programme that was dropped because\r\n\r\nof   the  programme  evaluation  system  as  yet.   Programme\r\n\r\nevaluation  is  still  very  new.   I  can  understand   some\r\n\r\nvoluntary  organisations  may  initially  feel  uncomfortable\r\n\r\nabout  the  programme evaluation system, just  like  me  when\r\n\r\nmanagement  by objective was first introduced  in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.   I  was  a civil servant then.  I  also  felt  very\r\n\r\nuncomfortable.  But as the years go by, I find  that  I  have\r\n\r\nbetter  communication with my boss on what I am  supposed  to\r\n\r\ndo.  At  the  end of it, I feel better; he feels  better  and\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  is  minimised.  I  am  confident  programme\r\n\r\nevaluation will likewise be well accepted.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> May I seek a clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister?

In other words, I wish to know  how\r\n\r\ndo  we ensure that we have a means of checking that they  are\r\n\r\nactually qualified to teach and can teach the right  kind  of\r\n\r\nmaterials in Islam.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

If need be, I will find the details and  pass\r\n\r\nit  to  the Member.

But  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that the funding method to VWOs has been  changed,\r\n\r\nfrom  one which is from organisation to programme.  So  there\r\n\r\nis  no link even with the evaluation system.

In fact, I would say it is very good for the VWOs  to\r\n\r\nhave  a list of performance indicators when it comes to fund-raising.    If  increasingly,  we  look  to  corporates   for\r\n\r\nsponsorship, the corporates would want to know that when they\r\n\r\ndonate  a  certain amount of money, what would their donation\r\n\r\nadd  to the achievement of the voluntary organisation.  Also,\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the indicators that we can give them so that  they\r\n\r\ncan  satisfy their shareholders that by donating that  amount\r\n\r\nof  money, they have got all those social services delivered.\r\n\r\nAnd  have  the  performance indicators actually provided  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary  organisations with a good currency to  communicate\r\n\r\nwith  the potential donors, to win over their confidence and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, win over their funding.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, the People's Association was\r\n\r\nformed  in  1960  under the Prime Minister's  Office.

Since\r\n\r\n1985,  the Association has been placed under the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development and Sports.

To  bridge the digital divide in Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nfollowing initiatives could go a long way:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Specific needs and problems of the digital have-nots in using ICT should be researched. Here, agencies like\r\n\r\nIDA can help PA in playing a key role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Customise IT training tailored to the specific\r\n\r\nneeds of these digital have-nots need to be made available at\r\n\r\nvery  low  cost.  Here, GROs and CDCs and organisations  like\r\n\r\nthe  People Developer can take the lead.

The\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association  is a public  body  and  it  should  be\r\n\r\npolitically neutral.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, ever since its establishment in the mid-60s, the PA\r\n\r\nhas  played  a  very  important role in  rallying  grassroots\r\n\r\nsupport  for  the  PAP.  This is not  right,  Sir.   Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister clarify if this is not an abuse of State funds?   If\r\n\r\nthe real objective of PA is to serve the people, then why did\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  Government deny legally elected  MPs  from  serving\r\n\r\ntheir  wards  by appointing PAP candidates who  lost  in  the\r\n\r\nelections as grassroots advisors?  It is so strange that  all\r\n\r\nthe grassroots advisors are all Members of Parliament, except\r\n\r\nin Potong Pasir and Hougang constituencies.  Can the Minister\r\n\r\njustify  why  the PA is not appointing Mr Chiam,  Member  for\r\n\r\nPotong  Pasir and Mr Low, Member for Hougang, as the official\r\n\r\ngrassroots  advisor respectively?  Can the  Minister  explain\r\n\r\nwhy  he  allowed the PA to appoint the losers in the  general\r\n\r\nelection as grassroots advisors instead?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, the CDCs have been doing a\r\n\r\ntremendous job in very many diverse activities and programmes\r\n\r\nsince their formation in 1997.  With all CDCs now having full-time  Mayors, these organisations are well-placed to do  even\r\n\r\nmore for the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than five years since their inception, it may\r\n\r\nbe  timely to do an evaluation on the progress that has  been\r\n\r\nmade by CDCs so far.  The Prime Minister, in his National Day\r\n\r\nRally  speech  on  17th August 1996 said  that  CDCs  are  to\r\n\r\nrekindle the old community spirit of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmutual  help  where the more able and successful should  help\r\n\r\nthe  less able and less well-off as they used to do and  were\r\n\r\nrespected for doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community, especially those who receive help would\r\n\r\nnaturally respect the successful who have looked after  them,\r\n\r\ninstead of resenting their success.  Now more than five years\r\n\r\nlater,  on 5th January 2002, the Prime Minister, in a  speech\r\n\r\nat  the Mayor's swearing-in ceremony, reiterated the message.\r\n\r\nHe  said the CDCs should not be mistaken as welfare agencies.\r\n\r\nElaborating,  the Prime Minister said that in order  to  bond\r\n\r\nthe   community,  CDCs  would  have  to  mobilise  the   more\r\n\r\nsuccessful  Singaporeans to look after  those  stuck  at  the\r\n\r\nlower  rungs of the ladder.  Could the Minister tell  us  how\r\n\r\nsuccessful  have  CDCs  been getting more  able  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  helping the less able?  Have we  been  able  to\r\n\r\nestablish appropriate performance indicators for our CDCs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the budget for CDCs has also been increased from\r\n\r\n$19  million in 1997 to $153 million in 2001, and  will  rise\r\n\r\nfurther  as they take on more programmes, like looking  after\r\n\r\nthe  elderly  and setting up branch offices.  With  more  and\r\n\r\nmore  public funds being allocated to CDCs, would it  not  be\r\n\r\ntimely  then for CDCs to be regulated by its own  Act  rather\r\n\r\nthan remain under the umbrella of the PA Act?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each CDC should also be required to furnish an annual\r\n\r\nreport  of their income, expenditure, and their achievements,\r\n\r\nsimilar to that currently being done by the Town Councils.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I declare my interest as\r\n\r\nMayor of North East CDC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently Radio 93.8 started a series of programmes where\r\n\r\nthey interviewed Mayors and staff of the CDCs, to explain and\r\n\r\nto  talk  about the CDCs.  To my surprise, most of those  who\r\n\r\nwere  interviewed by Radio 93.8 claimed that  they  were  not\r\n\r\naware  of what CDC was all about, and that they did not  even\r\n\r\nknow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  their Mayors were, despite the fact that we have carried\r\n\r\nout  quite a number of activities.  Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon said\r\n\r\non  the programme that South West CDC had 500 activities, and\r\n\r\nI  am sure a lot other CDCs have equally impressive number of\r\n\r\nprogrammes to talk about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the PA and the Minister-in-charge would\r\n\r\nexplain  the  thinking  behind the CDC.   I  know  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  himself  has been a champion of CDC  and  has  made\r\n\r\nquite  a number of speeches explaining CDC's role.  But,  CDC\r\n\r\nis  an evolving entity.  In fact, a number of the Mayors were\r\n\r\ndoing  part-time  before, and only  last  term  we  have  MPs\r\n\r\nserving  as  full-time  Mayors.   So  in  the  nature  of  it\r\n\r\nevolving,  from  a  role  which I think  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nexplained  as  \"to  play  a bonding role  to  provide  social\r\n\r\ncohesion\",  it has over the last six months spent  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ntime  and  energy on \"jobs, jobs, jobs\".  So I think  in  the\r\n\r\nlight of this evolving profile and nature of CDC, I hope  the\r\n\r\nPA  and  the Minister-in-charge will explain the profile  and\r\n\r\nthe thinking behind the role of CDC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, Mr Charles Chong asked why PA\r\n\r\nshould not be under the Prime Minister's Office, and he  also\r\n\r\nmentioned that there were instances in the past when  the  PA\r\n\r\nwas  under  other Ministries.  In fact, this was  so.   Since\r\n\r\n1960  till  1979, the People's Association was put under  the\r\n\r\ncharge of four different Ministries - from Ministry of Labour\r\n\r\nto  Ministry of Social Affairs, to Ministry of Culture,  then\r\n\r\nMinistry of Social Affairs, Ministry of Interior and  Defence\r\n\r\nand  back  to  Ministry  of Culture.  It  depended  on  which\r\n\r\nMinister  the  Prime Minister appointed as  Deputy  Chairman.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why  in 1995, in order to avoid this  switching  of\r\n\r\nMinistries,  PA  was  put under the Prime Minister's  Office.\r\n\r\nBut,  then  when  the  role of the then  Ministry  of  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs  was  reviewed, and Ministry of Community Development\r\n\r\n(MCD)  was  formed,  the decision was that  PA  actually  had\r\n\r\nsynergy with the roles of the new MCD because MCD and PA were\r\n\r\nboth promoting social cohesion, racial harmony, communication\r\n\r\nbetween  the Government and the community.  Hence PA was  put\r\n\r\nunder the new MCD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So one way of looking at Mr Charles Chong's question is\r\n\r\nit  really  does  not  matter.  Through all  these  years  of\r\n\r\nmoving,  the  People's Association continues to perform.   It\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  come out with new programmes, it continues  to\r\n\r\nmove  ahead,  it  continues to serve the  community.   Today,\r\n\r\nunder  the  Ministry  of  Community  Development  and  Sports\r\n\r\n(MCDS),  PA and MCDS continue to benefit from their  synergy.\r\n\r\nI feel MCDS is a good place to place PA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked how much jurisdiction the\r\n\r\nMinister had over People's Association.  PA has actually been\r\n\r\nquite autonomous in their work, as long as they stick to  the\r\n\r\ncharge  given  to  them by the PA Act.   This  fact  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant  than how much jurisdiction the Minister  has  over\r\n\r\nthe   People's   Association.   The  People's   Association's\r\n\r\nChairman  remains the Prime Minister.  He usually appoints  a\r\n\r\nMinister  to  be the Deputy Chairman, and at this  particular\r\n\r\npoint  of time, my Minister and I are on the PA Board.   But,\r\n\r\nbased  on history, even if we are not on the Board,  PA  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to perform what it is supposed to perform.   So  it\r\n\r\nactually does not matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the digital divide which Mr Zainul Abidin\r\n\r\nasked, I would say that that particular budget item under the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association  is  to  highlight  PA's  role  in  the\r\n\r\nNational  IT  Literacy  Programme.  I think  the  House  will\r\n\r\nprobably  know  that  the Ministry of Manpower  and  Infocomm\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Authority  of  Singapore  (IDA)  introduced  the\r\n\r\nNational  IT  Literacy  Programme.   The  objective  of   the\r\n\r\nprogramme  is  to train 350,000 Singaporeans in computer  and\r\n\r\nInternet basics, by April 2004.  The People's Association has\r\n\r\nbeen  given the role of training 90,000 people, out of  these\r\n\r\n350,000.   So,  we  have been conducting IT courses  in  four\r\n\r\nofficial  languages,  targeting senior citizens,  homemakers,\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders, those who have not been  trained  in  IT\r\n\r\nbefore.   We  have about 20,000 residents who have  undergone\r\n\r\ntraining  at about 40 community centres as well as  community\r\n\r\nclubs.  We jointly organise these training\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourses with commercial training agencies, as well as various\r\n\r\nIT training centres.  In addition, we also have two roving IT\r\n\r\nvans to bring IT classrooms to the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On working with IDA and other agencies, I want to assure\r\n\r\nMr  Zainul that we work very closely with IDA and many  other\r\n\r\nagencies.  In fact, we also work with voluntary organisations\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Retired  Seniors Volunteer  Programme  (RSVP),  the\r\n\r\nmosques, the Singapore Association for the Deaf, as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe  various  self-help  groups  in  realising  what  we  are\r\n\r\nsupposed to do in this IT masterplan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked a question on PA that any Opposition\r\n\r\nMember  would ask.  He asked probably on behalf of  Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nand  Mr Low, but I think both have asked this question  many,\r\n\r\nmany  times,  and the answer is still the same.   He  got  it\r\n\r\nright.   The  People's Association is a Government  statutory\r\n\r\nboard.  It is not part of the PAP.  The PAP MPs draw a  very,\r\n\r\nvery clear line between our PA activities, as well as our PAP\r\n\r\nbranch  activities.  We do not hold our branch activities  in\r\n\r\nthe  community centres.  I can assure him of  that.   We  are\r\n\r\nvery  professional about it.  And since it  is  a  Government\r\n\r\nstatutory board, members of the public can come and  use  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  take part in the programmes,  regardless  of\r\n\r\npolitical  affiliation.  But, when it comes  to  picking  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  charge,  the Government, like picking  people  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of other Government agencies, will have to  look  for\r\n\r\npeople who have the same vision, share the same objective, in\r\n\r\norder  to  do  this  job  of leading the  various  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we put the Opposition Members as the Advisors of the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations, we can be sure that the grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations will be politicised.  There will be no  end  of\r\n\r\nquarrels between the People's Association, who is supposed to\r\n\r\nbe  a  Government  body,  and the  ward  which  is  with  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.   This will not serve the objective of  achieving\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion.  We owe it to the residents to ensure  that\r\n\r\npolitics stays out of our community centres.  That is why PAP\r\n\r\nstays out of the community centres and we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappoint people in charge to make sure that politics stays out\r\n\r\nof the community centres and the grassroots organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, Sir, I think Mdm Halimah also asked about the\r\n\r\nissue of involving Malays, especially younger Malays, in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centre activities.  We have to acknowledge that  we\r\n\r\nwould like to have more participation by the Malays, as  well\r\n\r\nas  Indian Singaporeans, in our community centres.  After all\r\n\r\nthe objectives of our community centres are to achieve social\r\n\r\ncohesion,  racial  harmony, as well as better  communication.\r\n\r\nWe  admit that we have quite a lot of work to do still.  But,\r\n\r\nwe  are trying.  We have a few schemes to deliberately try to\r\n\r\nencourage more Malay residents to join us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association has adopted a policy to co-locate some of the community centres with voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations  some  of  which  are  from  the   Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity.   This is for greater synergy, and to encourage  a\r\n\r\nwider network of Singaporeans to visit the community centres.\r\n\r\nFor    example,   Telok   Ayer-Hong   Lim   Green   Community\r\n\r\nCentre/Pondok Glam - that is one of the co-locations; Kampong\r\n\r\nUbi Community Club/Singapore Diki Barat Federation - that  is\r\n\r\nanother co-location; Singapore Hadra and Kampong Association,\r\n\r\nthat  is  also  in  Kampong Ubi; Toa Payoh Central  Community\r\n\r\nBuilding  has got Majlis Pusat, and Pasir Ris East  Community\r\n\r\nBuilding  and  the  Association of Muslim Professionals.   We\r\n\r\nhope   that   such  co-locations  will  improve  inter-ethnic\r\n\r\ninteraction and cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah may also be pleased to note that amongst the\r\n\r\nyouth  movement, we have what we call Project Prompt.   Under\r\n\r\nProject Prompt, if the youth programme can involve more  than\r\n\r\n25%  non-Chinese, PA will give them a small additional grant.\r\n\r\nSo  far,  there  are, I understand, more than 100  programmes\r\n\r\nbeing given such grants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of the IRCCs, as my Minister has\r\n\r\nexplained in much details earlier, we believe that there will\r\n\r\nbe  even  more opportunities for inter-ethnic interaction  in\r\n\r\nour community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now go over to the Community Development\r\n\r\nCouncils.  I think both Mr Zainul as well as Mr Charles Chong\r\n\r\nasked   about  the  progress  of  the  Community  Development\r\n\r\nCouncils.   First of all, in the speech given  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in 1996, as well as in 2002, that Mr Charles  Chong\r\n\r\nquoted,  he  sketched out the long-term vision of Singapore's\r\n\r\ncommunity.   There  should be very good social  cohesion,  of\r\n\r\nkampong  spirit, of the more successful willing to  help  the\r\n\r\nless  successful, and as a result achieve a good  feeling  of\r\n\r\nrootedness.   It is a very, very long-term vision,  which  we\r\n\r\nwill  all  be striving for.  CDCs were only established  five\r\n\r\nyears  ago in 1997.  So, of course, we still have a long  way\r\n\r\nto go.  However, I have to say that the Community Development\r\n\r\nCouncils  have  made very good progress.  It  is  becoming  a\r\n\r\nlocal  administration which is relevant to the lives  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents.  Since they were initiated in 1997, the CDCs  have\r\n\r\nbeen  building up their role as mobilisers of public, private\r\n\r\nand  community resources, to bring about a more cohesive  and\r\n\r\nharmonious society.  They reach out to the more successful to\r\n\r\nhelp   the  less  able,  for  example,  through  their   many\r\n\r\nvolunteers' programmes as well as joint programmes  with  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary  organisations.  The CDCs  also  deliver  community\r\n\r\ndevelopment  programmes, ranging from  arts  appreciation  to\r\n\r\nlife-long  learning to healthy lifestyle, to  Racial  Harmony\r\n\r\nDay, as well as Grandparents Day.  So, they have a very, very\r\n\r\nwide  range  of  social programmes as well as social  service\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs have also tried to achieve a good balance of\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders, professionals as well as other talents in\r\n\r\ntheir ranks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, which I believe is a very, very important year\r\n\r\nfor  the CDCs, the CDCs successfully took on a wide range  of\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  public  services from the  Ministries.   This\r\n\r\nincludes  social assistance and social service  schemes  from\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Community Development and Sports (MCDS) since\r\n\r\n1st April 2001, as well as the Primary Care and Partnership\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScheme  (PCPS)  from  the Ministry  of  Health.   If  Members\r\n\r\nrecall, PCPS is actually a scheme where senior citizens  from\r\n\r\nthe  lower income group, with a certain card, can go and  see\r\n\r\nthe  participating GPs who are in private practice,  so  that\r\n\r\nthey do not have to always go to the polyclinics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs, together with grassroots organisations, help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  who  missed out on the CPF Top-up  Scheme  and\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens  who did not participate in  the  MediShield\r\n\r\nScheme for the elderly, to sign up for the schemes.  The CDCs\r\n\r\nalso  work with the CPF Board and the Ministry of Finance  to\r\n\r\nadminister CPF top-ups as well as the New Singapore Shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that CDCs have benefited from synergy on the\r\n\r\nground,  as  well  as  with the Ministries,  because  of  the\r\n\r\nparticipation of the CDCs.  Because CDCs have been doing very\r\n\r\nwell,  in  November 2001, we decided that it should aim  even\r\n\r\nhigher. That is why full-time Mayors were appointed, and  the\r\n\r\nCDCs were consolidated from nine to become five, each with  a\r\n\r\npopulation of roughly half a million or so.  We believe  that\r\n\r\nthis is probably an optimal size.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being closer to the people, the CDCs have been able to\r\n\r\noffer  a  more  convenient and personalised  service  to  the\r\n\r\nresidents.  I must say that even for those services that  are\r\n\r\ndelegated from the Ministries to the CDCs, the CDCs have been\r\n\r\ndoing  very  well.   The processing time,  for  example,  for\r\n\r\npublic assistance cases has improved, partly because CDCs are\r\n\r\ncloser to the ground, so they know the residents better.  And\r\n\r\npartly  also because they are closer to the ground, they  are\r\n\r\nsubject  to more pressure to settle cases early, so the  CDCs\r\n\r\nwork  harder.   All  these  are  to  the  advantage  of   the\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the current economic recession, like what Mr\r\n\r\nZainul  said, the CDCs have been very, very active in helping\r\n\r\nthe  retrenched  workers,  by augmenting  interim  short-term\r\n\r\nfinancial  help  with  career counselling,  job-matching  and\r\n\r\nskills upgrading, retraining opportunities,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand so on.  In fact, I would say that all the Mayors come  up\r\n\r\nwith  excellent  ideas and they are all different.   Maybe  I\r\n\r\nwill just list a few.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Mayor Othman Haron Eusofe of South East CDC\r\n\r\npiloted  a  training and employment programme for child  care\r\n\r\nand domestic help to increase the employment opportunities of\r\n\r\nits  residents in the informal service sector.  I think  that\r\n\r\nis very innovative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayor Teo Ho Pin has been actively introducing jobs from\r\n\r\nvarious companies, like Sembawang Shipyard and TIBS,  to  the\r\n\r\nresidents  of  North West CDC, and, therefore,  bringing  the\r\n\r\nemployers and the potential employees closer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayor Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has launched the South West CDC\r\n\r\ncommunity portal and e-job messaging system where job seekers\r\n\r\nare  informed through SMS and/or e-mail of their  success  in\r\n\r\njob-matching facilitated by the CDC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to just looking for jobs, I think the CDCs\r\n\r\nhave   also   supported  the  CCCs  in  forming  Inter-racial\r\n\r\nConfidence Circles as well as working with other bodies  such\r\n\r\nas  schools, companies and voluntary welfare organisations to\r\n\r\nform Harmony Circles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayor Zainul Abidin Rasheed of North East CDC introduced\r\n\r\nthe  home-stay  programme aimed at promoting  greater  inter-racial  understanding.  And Mayor Othman  initiated  a  South\r\n\r\nEast  CDC racial harmony youth ambassadors programme.   Mayor\r\n\r\nHeng  Chee How - I have not forgotten him - Central Singapore\r\n\r\nCDC,  has  harmony circles working with self-help groups  and\r\n\r\nother  community  organisations, like  the  Hindu  Endowments\r\n\r\nBoard  and  Singapore Khalsa Association, to promote  greater\r\n\r\ninter-racial harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the CDCs have done quite a bit. Of course,\r\n\r\nsome of the residents still say that, \"Look, I actually still\r\n\r\ndo  not  know about the CDC.\"  And I think Mayor  Zainul  has\r\n\r\nexpressed  a certain amount of disappointment there.   But  I\r\n\r\nwould say, keep trying.

In  fact,  through the various  programmes,  we  have\r\n\r\nalready touched the life of many, many Singaporeans.   If  we\r\n\r\ncan touch the lives of even more Singaporeans, everybody will\r\n\r\nrecognise  the  CDC.   So,  I  would  say,  do  not  be   too\r\n\r\ndisappointed.   It is still early days yet.  Looking  at  the\r\n\r\nprogress  that we have achieved so far, I think we have  done\r\n\r\nquite  well.  Give us a little bit more time.  I  think  life\r\n\r\nshould be kind to the CDCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered all the questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I have three\r\n\r\nclarifications  for the Minister of State.  What  vision  and\r\n\r\nwhat  objective are the Minister referring to?  Has he  tried\r\n\r\nany  of  the Opposition MPs to realise that their vision  and\r\n\r\nobjective are quite close to the PA?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second clarification. Just because it is an Opposition\r\n\r\nMP,  the  grassroots  organisations become  politicised.   It\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  politicised  when  the  PAP  candidates   are\r\n\r\nappointed as grassroots advisers.  Is that the case?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third clarification. If the Minister wants politics to\r\n\r\nstay out, should not the elected MP stay in as the grassroots\r\n\r\nadviser instead?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, that is why the PAP MPs are the\r\n\r\ngrassroots   advisers,  not  the  head  of   the   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisation.  We are only there to advise.   So  he  got  it\r\n\r\nright there.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The MOS, in his answer, says the\r\n\r\nPA's  objective is social and community bonding.  CCCs,  RCs,\r\n\r\nthe  community centres are non-political.  And he  said,  \"We\r\n\r\ndraw  a very clear line.\"  I want to know from him how  clear\r\n\r\nthe line is, and how sure he is about what he says.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, I think I have not answered Mr\r\n\r\nSteve  Chia's  questions completely.  So I shall  answer  his\r\n\r\nquestions first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not say that the Opposition Members do not share\r\n\r\nthe objective of, for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexample,  social cohesion.  I am just saying that  Opposition\r\n\r\nMPs,  by  their  nature, would have to  oppose  some  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  policies,  and that would include  some  of  PA's\r\n\r\nprogrammes and the methods of implementation, and so on.   In\r\n\r\ndoing  so,  bearing in mind the kind of passion that  I  hear\r\n\r\nwhen  this subject was discussed in the Committee of  Supply,\r\n\r\nwe  risk getting the grassroots organisations from opposition\r\n\r\nward  into political conflicts with the People's Association,\r\n\r\nrather  than  concentrating on helping the residents  improve\r\n\r\ntheir lot.  That basically is my point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the PAP, are very clear about this point.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we draw a clear line.  All Government  programmes\r\n\r\ncan  be  political to the extent that if we do a good job  in\r\n\r\nany  Government  programme,  for example,  in  education,  or\r\n\r\ntransport,  we will get greater support in the  next  General\r\n\r\nElection.   So  if we do a very, very good job  in  achieving\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion,  racial  harmony,  and  we  achieve  better\r\n\r\nsupport in the next General Election, I would say that  there\r\n\r\nis nothing wrong, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister of State seems to be\r\n\r\nconfused with social cohesion, community cohesion and support\r\n\r\nfor  the nation to one that is ensuring bonding with the PAP.\r\n\r\nWould he clarify that?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Since when did I say \"bonding with the\r\n\r\nPAP\"?

Among other things, the\r\n\r\namendment  introduces  a compulsory retirement  age  for  key\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders in the CCC and CCMC.  The key posts  that\r\n\r\nare  now  subject  to an age limit of 65  years  include  the\r\n\r\nChairman,  Secretary and the Treasurer.  This rule  does  not\r\n\r\ntake into consideration the number of years in office or  the\r\n\r\nability  of  potential  office-holders and  indicates  ageism\r\n\r\nwhich  stems from a negative view of ageing and old age.   It\r\n\r\nalso  fails to realise that there are many people  who  after\r\n\r\nretirement from a full and rewarding career, at the age of 62\r\n\r\nyears  or  older,  now  have more  time  to  be  involved  in\r\n\r\ncommunity service,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narmed with a life-time of experience and knowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enforcing a prohibition based solely on the arbitrary\r\n\r\nage  of  65  years, in favour of nurturing  new  and  younger\r\n\r\nleaders  to  keep  up  with  the  changing  expectations  and\r\n\r\naspirations  of  the  residents  they  serve,  reflects   the\r\n\r\npreoccupation  that  we  are still a  youth-oriented  society\r\n\r\nwhen,  in reality, we are among the fastest ageing population\r\n\r\nin  the  world.   Although  the new  rules  appear  to  allow\r\n\r\nexceptions,  provided specific approval has been obtained  by\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Association, it does not indicate  under  what\r\n\r\ncircumstances would approval be granted.  Could the  Minister\r\n\r\nindicate  what percentage of grassroots leaders in these  key\r\n\r\npositions are aged 65 years and above, and tell us  why  this\r\n\r\nrule  is even necessary, when it is well within the authority\r\n\r\nof the advisers of the grassroots organisations to appoint or\r\n\r\nreplace non-performing or unsuitable grassroots leaders?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, to look at this particular issue,\r\n\r\nwe  have to see things in context.  We are only talking about\r\n\r\nthe Chairman, the Secretary and Treasurer of the CCCs and the\r\n\r\nCCMCs.   About  17% of the current incumbents  of  these  key\r\n\r\nposts  are  above  65 years old.  This policy  of  compulsory\r\n\r\nwithdrawal was for leadership renewal.  It is not because  of\r\n\r\nageism.   We recognise that there are many grassroots leaders\r\n\r\nwho  are  still able to contribute, even though they  are  65\r\n\r\nyears  old.   But the key leadership positions  of  Chairman,\r\n\r\nSecretary   and  Treasurer  required  more  attention,   more\r\n\r\ncommitment of energy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grassroots leaders have been asking why should we not\r\n\r\nhave an upper limit on the number of terms that incumbents in\r\n\r\nkey  leadership  positions should  serve.   In  many  of  the\r\n\r\nassociations, the Chairman cannot serve more than two  terms,\r\n\r\nbecause  they consider that it is important to have a dynamic\r\n\r\nleadership.    PA  had  been  considering  the  matter   very\r\n\r\ncarefully  for  quite some time before coming  out  with  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of retirement age at 65 years old for the Chairman,\r\n\r\nthe Secretary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the Treasurer.  If we do not do that, some of the younger\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders would find that they have no chance,  and\r\n\r\nwould not want to come forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are Chairmen, Secretaries and\r\n\r\nTreasurers who are still very vibrant and still very alert at\r\n\r\n65  years.  And there may be certain grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nwhere, if the Chairman steps down right now, there may be  no\r\n\r\none  to  take over.  Under such circumstances, if the advisor\r\n\r\nputs  up an appeal, the People's Association will look at  it\r\n\r\nand  will  usually agree.  But, of course,  we  will  do  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  remind the advisors that,  \"Well,  you  should\r\n\r\nconsider  succession  after this term.\"   Even  our  national\r\n\r\nleadership talks about succession all the time.  So  why  not\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations?  If there is no succession,  there\r\n\r\nis  no new life, and the grassroots organisations will not be\r\n\r\ndynamic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when these key grassroots leaders retire, there are\r\n\r\nstill plenty of opportunities for them.  There are many other\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisation postings for them, if they still want\r\n\r\nto  serve.  And for the deserving ones, they can be appointed\r\n\r\neither  as  Patron,  Honorary  Chairman  or  Immediate   Past\r\n\r\nChairman.   All these options are there because the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation values long serving grassroots leaders.  We  want\r\n\r\nto  recognise them, we want them to continue to be associated\r\n\r\nwith  the grassroots movement, and we want them to come  back\r\n\r\nto  attend  our functions with certain official  position  of\r\n\r\nimportance,  and  they can still give  advice  to  the  newer\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders who may have taken over.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to summarise by saying again this is\r\n\r\nnot  ageism.   It  is for leadership renewal  which  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant  for  any organisation.  It will be  good  for  our\r\n\r\ngrassroots movement and we implement it with flexibility.  If\r\n\r\nthe  advisors have good reasons to want to have specific  old\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leader  to  serve one  more  term,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nproblem.  We will look at it and we will probably agree.  And\r\n\r\nalso,   very   importantly,  we  make  sure  that   deserving\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders retire with dignity as well as with a good\r\n\r\ntitle that they deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I would like to seek\r\n\r\nclarification  from the Minister of State.  The  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState,  on  two  occasions, stated that the 65-year  old  age\r\n\r\nlimit  is  for leadership renewal.  But is he aware that  the\r\n\r\nregulation  prohibits  not only the  re-appointment  but  the\r\n\r\nappointment  itself.   This means  that  even  before  he  is\r\n\r\nappointed, if he is 65 years old, he cannot be appointed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, as I said, if there are specific\r\n\r\ngood  grassroots leaders that any of the advisors here  would\r\n\r\nwant  to  appoint for good reasons, please let me  know.

In  the  present\r\n\r\neconomic  climate, there will be increasing  demands  on  our\r\n\r\nVWOs for help.  There will also be increasing competition for\r\n\r\nthe  charity dollar.  The National Council of Social Service,\r\n\r\nthrough the Community Chest, raises approximately $42 million\r\n\r\na  year to serve 314,000 clients through 130 programmes.   By\r\n\r\ncontrast,  according  to  its website,  the  National  Kidney\r\n\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraises  $59 million a year to provide for the 1,900  patients\r\n\r\ndialysing under the NKF programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both are fine organisations doing excellent work, but\r\n\r\nMembers  may agree with me that it appears that the  ComChest\r\n\r\nseems  to  have less presence and less reach in the minds  of\r\n\r\nthe average Singaporean.  This will have an inevitable effect\r\n\r\non its ability to raise funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to consider helping to level\r\n\r\nthe  playing field for the Community Chest and its stable  of\r\n\r\nfunded  agencies by assisting NCSS to revamp  and  strengthen\r\n\r\nits  publicity  and  fund  raising capability  to  match  the\r\n\r\njuggernaut of the NKF.  This is not to mention the  needs  of\r\n\r\nmany  other non-funded VWOs, who do not come under  the  NCSS\r\n\r\nfunding  umbrella but who have to raise their own funds.   At\r\n\r\nthe  very least, I would like ComChest to be able to  compete\r\n\r\non  an  equal  footing  with the NKF in  persuading  schools,\r\n\r\ncommunity  organisations,  Government  agencies  and  private\r\n\r\nsector  organisations  that there are many  other  worthwhile\r\n\r\ncharities  in  Singapore, and that they too  deserve  funding\r\n\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, very briefly, I am glad to report\r\n\r\nthat  the  Chairman of ComChest, Ms Jennie  Chua,  recognises\r\n\r\nthis  problem.

I am concerned about the\r\n\r\nimportant  role that systems in the environment  of  juvenile\r\n\r\noffenders  play  in their rehabilitation.   There  are  three\r\n\r\nquestions  I  would like to ask.  One, is  the  role  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily.  The Children and Young Persons Act was amended  last\r\n\r\nyear to allow the courts to mandate parents to be involved in\r\n\r\nthe  rehabilitation of juvenile offenders.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nask the Minister, to-date, what is the extent of the parental\r\n\r\ninvolvement   in   the  rehabilitation  of   these   juvenile\r\n\r\noffenders,    especially   in   relation   to    professional\r\n\r\nintervention,  rather  than just merely celebrating  Mother's\r\n\r\nDay  and  Father's Day together.  Second, is on the  role  of\r\n\r\nschools.   Oftentimes,  I  have heard  pleas  by  residential\r\n\r\ninstitutions  that  have  difficulty placing  these  juvenile\r\n\r\noffenders  back  to school.  May I know what is  the  current\r\n\r\nsituation   right   now?   Are  the   children   facing   any\r\n\r\ndifficulties  getting  back  to  school?   And,   third,   is\r\n\r\ncommunity  involvement.   What  is  the  level  of  community\r\n\r\ninvolvement   in  the  rehabilitation  of  these   offenders,\r\n\r\nespecially   in   relation  to  the  role   that   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  can  play in helping these juvenile  offenders\r\n\r\nrehabilitate?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, time is running out. I will give\r\n\r\nDr  Maliki  a more detailed explanation later.  But  I  would\r\n\r\nsay,  very  briefly,  that it was only  last  year  that  the\r\n\r\nChildren  and  Young Persons Act was amended to  mandate,  in\r\n\r\ncertain cases, parents' involvement in the rehabilitation  of\r\n\r\nchildren  and young persons.  So far, 20 parents of  juvenile\r\n\r\noffenders  in  the Homes and 50 parents of probationers  have\r\n\r\nbeen  given such orders, and they have done their job.  As  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  this is still early days.  The Act was passed  at  the\r\n\r\nend  of  last year and it is hardly six months away.  But  we\r\n\r\nhave  already  seen very good promises.  Given  a  period  of\r\n\r\ntime,  few  years  perhaps, we will be able  to  report  good\r\n\r\nresults.   Involvement of the schools, self-help  groups  and\r\n\r\nthe  community  is  something  that  MCDS  always  tries   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate, and we will continue to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (5), Dr Lily Neo.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, due to time constraint,\r\n\r\ncould I be given the permission to skip amendment No. (5) and\r\n\r\nto go on to amendment No. (6) instead?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, you can.

Elderly abuse is seldom reported, and\r\n\r\nthis  is even more so in our Asian society where filial piety\r\n\r\nand  respect  for  the  elderly  is  traditional  and  highly\r\n\r\nregarded.   Sir,  it is to be noted that abused  elderly  are\r\n\r\nunlikely  to  report  on  their  own  families  for  fear  of\r\n\r\nembarrassment  and fear of losing whatever care  and  support\r\n\r\nthey  may  have.  The lack of awareness and support  services\r\n\r\nhere is a contributory factor to this situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey which was conducted from May 1994 to December\r\n\r\n1997 on those who were 65 years or older who presented to the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Department for non-accidental trauma or complaints\r\n\r\nof  other acts of cruelty showed that in 58.8% of cases,  the\r\n\r\nassailants  were the daughters-in-law or sons.   The  average\r\n\r\nage  of the elderly was 74.6 years old and a majority of them\r\n\r\nwere ambulatory but had chronic medical illnesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protection from persons causing hurt, continual\r\n\r\nharassment, threat, wrongful confinement is spelt out in Part\r\n\r\nVII  of  the Women's Charter (Chapter 353 of the 1997 Revised\r\n\r\nEdition).   Under this Chapter, the victim can  apply  for  a\r\n\r\nProtection  Order.  Elderly abuse is not a  problem  seen  in\r\n\r\nisolation.  It is an integral part of family\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviolence.  Successful intervention may indirectly help  other\r\n\r\nvictims caught in the same cycle of violence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elderly abuse can be classified into four types: (1)\r\n\r\ninfliction  of  pain  and  injury;  (2)  debilitating  mental\r\n\r\nanguish;  (3)  unreasonable  confinement;  and  (4),  willful\r\n\r\ndeprivation  by caretaker of services necessary  to  maintain\r\n\r\nmental  and  physical health.  I believe that  abuse  of  the\r\n\r\nelderly  will  increase  in  tandem  with  our  fast   ageing\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge MCDS to campaign for better\r\n\r\nawareness, targeting especially the relatives and friends  of\r\n\r\nthe  victims  to let them know that help can  and  should  be\r\n\r\nsought for victims.

The successful pursuit of excellence\r\n\r\nin   sports   manifested   by  victories   in   international\r\n\r\ncompetitions   enhances   our   national   pride   and    our\r\n\r\ninternational standing.  This represented a marked shift from\r\n\r\njust providing for sports for all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, success in sports has that magic effect of\r\n\r\nstrengthening community bonds.  I remember in the  1970s  and\r\n\r\n1980s,  when  we  played in the Malaysia Cup,  regardless  of\r\n\r\nrace,   language   or  religion,  everyone   cheered   as   a\r\n\r\nSingaporean.   Chinese, Malays and Indians  sat  and  cheered\r\n\r\ntogether, rain or shine, each time the national team  played.\r\n\r\nAnd I remember well the Kallang Roar, which was heard loudest\r\n\r\nway  up  in Shah Alam, when we last won the Cup in 1994.   We\r\n\r\ndid not need any Inter-Racial Confidence Circle then to bring\r\n\r\nus  together.  I remember that when someone shouted  \"referee\r\n\r\nkayu\"  or \"kelong\", all of us knew what it meant and  we  all\r\n\r\nshouted  in  unison.  Such was the nationalistic fervour  and\r\n\r\nthe  powerful  bind  that pulled us together  every  time  we\r\n\r\ntasted success and glory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has given its support to the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Committee, 40 in all, with a  generous\r\n\r\ngrant  of $500 million under the Athletes Career and Training\r\n\r\n(ACT)  scheme, which will go some way in helping  to  make  a\r\n\r\nquantum leap in sports development.  The CoSS' target  is  to\r\n\r\nmake Singapore one of the top 10 sporting nations in Asia  by\r\n\r\nthe  year 2010.  The question I wish to pose now is:  can  we\r\n\r\nget  there?   Can  we produce champions who  can  become  our\r\n\r\nsports  heroes and icons, people who can instill  a  national\r\n\r\npride in us and enhance our international prestige?  In other\r\n\r\nwords, can we win?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our recent record of achievements has not been\r\n\r\nencouraging.  Our best\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperformance in the Southeast Asian Games was way back in 1983\r\n\r\nwhen  we  won  50  gold medals when the Games  were  held  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, finishing fourth out of nine countries,  and  even\r\n\r\nedging  out Malaysia.  In the last SEA Games, we won only  22\r\n\r\ngold  medals, finishing sixth out of 10 countries, ahead only\r\n\r\nof  lightweights  like  Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia  and  Brunei.\r\n\r\nCompare  this  with  Malaysia's 111  golds,  Thailand's  103,\r\n\r\nIndonesia's  72, Vietnam's 33 and the Philippines'  30.   And\r\n\r\nthat is only the Southeast Asian Games.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take football as another example. In 1998, Singapore\r\n\r\nwas  ranked  94th in the world and 12th in Asia.   Today,  we\r\n\r\nhave  slipped to 115th in the world and 22nd in  Asia.   Goal\r\n\r\n2010,  getting into the finals of the World Cup, is, at best,\r\n\r\na dream.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not had much to boast of lately. In the 1950s,\r\n\r\nwe  had household names like Wong Peng Soon in badminton.  In\r\n\r\n1960, Tan Howe Liang became our only Olympic hero when he won\r\n\r\na  silver  medal for weightlifting.  Over the years,  we  had\r\n\r\nother  notables like Junie Sng, Ang Peng Siong  and  Joscelin\r\n\r\nYeo.   We  were not exactly deprived, but sports heroes  have\r\n\r\nbeen few and far in between.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An oft-heard excuse for not producing champions is that\r\n\r\nwe  are a small nation and, as our population is small, we do\r\n\r\nnot  have  the large base from which to tap sporting  talent.\r\n\r\nThis  cannot  be  further  from the  truth.   India,  with  a\r\n\r\npopulation  of one billion people, is not exactly  known  for\r\n\r\nsporting  achievements,  except  maybe  for  cricket.    And,\r\n\r\nindeed,  Ireland, a country with a population  comparable  to\r\n\r\nthat  of Singapore, can produce a team for this year's  World\r\n\r\nCup.  So, too, Denmark.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we produce champions? I do not want to repeat\r\n\r\nwhat  is stated in the Report of the CoSS, but I wish to make\r\n\r\na  few  points.   First of all, we need to develop  a  sports\r\n\r\nculture  in Singapore.  This is a point which was highlighted\r\n\r\nin the report.  It seems to be the starting point.  Australia\r\n\r\nis  a  sports power because, amongst many other factors,  its\r\n\r\npeople are just crazy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  sports.   We,  therefore, need to raise  the  people's\r\n\r\ninterest  and awareness in sports.  In turn, sports  needs  a\r\n\r\nhigh  profile in the country.  We need participants,  but  we\r\n\r\nalso  need spectators who talk sports, watch sports and cheer\r\n\r\nfor sports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we need to identify talent early. Tiger Woods\r\n\r\nbecame  the  champion he is today because he started  hitting\r\n\r\naround  with  a golf club at the age of three.  South  Korean\r\n\r\nwoman golfer, Park Se Ri, also started playing the game  when\r\n\r\nshe  was  at a tender age, at around five or six.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsuggesting that we start arming our little toddlers with golf\r\n\r\nclubs  or  badminton  rackets, but  an  early  identification\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  sporting talent, beginning  with  our  primary\r\n\r\nschools, can be a starting point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can import foreign talent as a short cut. People\r\n\r\nlike Jing Jun Hong and Li Jia Wei and, now new citizens, like\r\n\r\nLi  Li  and Jiang Yan Mei, have done a lot for us.  And  they\r\n\r\nserve  as good role models for others.  But they cannot evoke\r\n\r\nthe same kind of passion as home-grown talents like Wong Peng\r\n\r\nSoon,  Tan  Howe Liang or Ang Peng Siong.  We need  to  start\r\n\r\nthem young, real young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have heard that some schools have even dropped\r\n\r\ngames  like  soccer and hockey from their CCA.   Even  Siglap\r\n\r\nSecondary  School,  I read recently, is a  school  known  for\r\n\r\nproducing  top  athletes in the past, most  noticeably,  Chee\r\n\r\nSwee Lee who won our last athletic gold in the Asian Games in\r\n\r\nTehran  in  1974.  The school had decided to drop its  annual\r\n\r\nsports  day, citing practical constraints for this  decision.\r\n\r\nThis  school, which was once a track and field power base  in\r\n\r\nthe  1960s  and 1970s, will now no longer be able to  produce\r\n\r\nnational champions.  Contrast this with what is happening  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia. There, the Ministry of Education has embarked on  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  produce world-class sports  stars  by  getting\r\n\r\nprimary  school  students to be active  in  sports.   It  has\r\n\r\nrealised  that  at the secondary level, it  is  too  late  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  true sports potential.  It has to start  in  primary\r\n\r\nschool  to ensure that a continuous stream of talent  can  be\r\n\r\nproduced and nurtured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  overall aim, in its own words, is for the country to  be\r\n\r\nable to produce its own David Beckham and Tiger Woods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know we have a sports talent identification\r\n\r\nprogramme,  but  we must ensure that talent is  spotted  very\r\n\r\nearly  and  not  too late.  The establishment of  the  sports\r\n\r\nschool  in  2004 to provide for students with the ability  to\r\n\r\npursue  excellence  in sports and academic  studies  is  very\r\n\r\nencouraging.   It  will be headed by a person  who  is  well-regarded.   But I heard from the grape vine that one  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst  things  this gentleman will be doing when  the  school\r\n\r\nopens  is  to  retire,  as by then,  he  would  have  reached\r\n\r\nretirement age.  I am a bit worried about this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with this early identification of talent must be a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  spirit.   Sports is all about  competition.   It\r\n\r\nmeans  not  being afraid to beat the other guy  in  order  to\r\n\r\nexcel and win.  It is heartening for me to read that the  old\r\n\r\nboys of Raffles Institution are not happy that they have lost\r\n\r\nthe  school's rugby championship title to ACS for many years.\r\n\r\nThey  have gotten together to raise $1 million to help  their\r\n\r\nAlma  Mater  regain the title.  This is the kind of  fighting\r\n\r\nspirit I like to see, people rallying behind to support their\r\n\r\nfavourite team, and the team fighting all the way to win.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was a student, my school, Anglo-Chinese School and a few others like RI and Chinese High,\r\n\r\nwere always fighting it out annually to be the top school  in\r\n\r\nathletics.   ACS  was,  of  course, the  undisputed  swimming\r\n\r\nchampion  for many years. Dr Tan Cheng Bock told me  recently\r\n\r\nthat  ACS always beat RI in swimming was because the  RI  had\r\n\r\nswimmers  like Mr Goh Chok Tong!  Sir, I would  like  to  add\r\n\r\nthat  the reason ACS was strong in swimming was because  they\r\n\r\nhad  swimmers  like  Mr  Chiam See Tong.   Luckily,  this  is\r\n\r\nprobably the only thing that Mr Chiam can ever beat  the  PAP\r\n\r\nin.   But  such was the spirit of competition in those  days,\r\n\r\nboth with competitors and the spectators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get to the top, we need money, which is what this\r\n\r\nspeech  is all about.  The Government has been very  generous\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits $500 million grant, but it might not be enough to produce\r\n\r\nsports  stars.   As we have heard earlier from the  Minister,\r\n\r\nthe  $500  million  is  spread  over  three  things:   sports\r\n\r\nexcellence, sports for all and sports industry.   So,  sports\r\n\r\nexcellence is not going to be getting very much.   Even  some\r\n\r\nof the National Sports Associations have told me that they do\r\n\r\nnot  feel the effects of the $500 million trickling  down  to\r\n\r\nthem.   The  operating expenditure of the Sports Council  has\r\n\r\nalso  been  reduced:  $45 million in 2001, $39  million  this\r\n\r\nyear.   Even this year's reduction represents a re-allocation\r\n\r\nof funds to the sports and youth programme under CoSS.  It is\r\n\r\nstill transferring from one pocket to another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it in another perspective for Members. David\r\n\r\nBeckham, we all know who he is. He is paid $1 million a month\r\n\r\nand  there  are  22  others like him in the  team.  They  are\r\n\r\nprobably  paid less, but they are just one such team  out  of\r\n\r\nmany  other teams in the football league in England. The  ACT\r\n\r\ngrant  can help push towards sports excellence.  But I  think\r\n\r\nwe  need  more to make a quantum leap and sustain it  over  a\r\n\r\nlong  period.  It takes more than five years if  we  want  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  constant stream of stars.  The report of CoSS states\r\n\r\nthat  it takes 8-12 years to have an athlete of international\r\n\r\nstandard.  Sports excellence must therefore be assured  of  a\r\n\r\nconstant stream of funds.  But where do we get the money?   I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister  for Finance does  not  see  this  as  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to further increase GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a suggestion, ie, it is time for us\r\n\r\nto  revisit  Singapore Pools.  Singapore  Pools,  if  Members\r\n\r\nrecall, was formed in 1968 to legalise forms of gambling.  It\r\n\r\nran the first Toto and later on, the Singapore Big Sweep,  4D\r\n\r\nand  now sports betting.  It was clearly stated then that its\r\n\r\nnet  proceeds  would go towards the building of  the  Kallang\r\n\r\nSports Complex, which would include the National Stadium  and\r\n\r\nother sports facilities.  If we further recall, the Big Sweep\r\n\r\ntickets even carried a picture of the National Stadium for  a\r\n\r\nlong  time.  To cut a long story short, we built our National\r\n\r\nStadium  with funds from Singapore Pools by early  1973.   In\r\n\r\n1980, Singapore Pools was no longer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  company  owned by the Ministry of Finance.   It  became  a\r\n\r\nsubsidiary of Temasek Holdings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Pools' earnings are huge. Last year, it made $114\r\n\r\nmillion  before  tax. Singapore Pools is one  of  the  finest\r\n\r\ncorporate  citizens  in Singapore.  It  gives  generously  to\r\n\r\nsports,  charities,  the  arts, even  funding  the  Esplanade\r\n\r\nTheatres on the Bay.  I applaud its generous contributions to\r\n\r\nmany worthy causes.  I know that Singapore Pools has provided\r\n\r\nthe large part of the $500 million ACT grant.  But like many,\r\n\r\nI believe that Pools can do more.  Perhaps it is time now for\r\n\r\nthe  Government to reconsider Pools' original  mission  of  a\r\n\r\ndirect link between its earnings and the promotion of sports,\r\n\r\nif  we  are to find the large funds to help us achieve sports\r\n\r\nexcellence.  With its large earning capacity, Singapore Pools\r\n\r\ncan  be  the long-term provider of large funds to  sports  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair, Sir, to do this, if we want more money from\r\n\r\nPools,   I   am   sure  Singapore  Pools   will   want   more\r\n\r\naccountability.  As a benefactor, it would want to  know  how\r\n\r\nwell  the  money is spent and what results are  produced.  We\r\n\r\nneed to have a kind of accountability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, we need to build sports heroes.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when the name of Fandi Ahmad was on the lips\r\n\r\nof  everyone  in Singapore, young and old. Everyone  probably\r\n\r\nknew  him better than they knew who their MP was.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nparticularly  worried about this. Fandi was not  world-class,\r\n\r\nbut  he  was our best of that time.  He was a rallying  point\r\n\r\nfor  the  people, an icon and a role model.  I hope that  one\r\n\r\nday  we  will be able to produce another Fandi who can  evoke\r\n\r\nthe  same passion and nationalistic pride in us, but one with\r\n\r\nthe class of Beckham or Ronaldo.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank Mr Tan Soo Khoon for his kind words regarding\r\n\r\nsports  development in Singapore.  Personally, I do not  have\r\n\r\nanything  to  disagree with him on the  points  that  he  has\r\n\r\nraised.  With regard to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow  Pools should change, I suppose that is a matter that  is\r\n\r\nbest  left  to the Ministry of Finance and Temasek  Holdings,\r\n\r\nand  not for the Ministry of Community Development and Sports\r\n\r\nto decide.  Let me clarify two things first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, he mentioned twice that the $500 million\r\n\r\nis  for  the ACT scheme.  The $500 million is the budget  for\r\n\r\nthe  Committee of Sporting Singapore (CoSS).  ACT is just one\r\n\r\npart  of  the  programme under CoSS.  Secondly, he  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  the principal of the Singapore Sports School,  Mr  Moo,\r\n\r\nwill be retiring soon. From what I have been told, he is less\r\n\r\nthan  55  years of age.  So he is definitely not retiring  as\r\n\r\nyet.  That  is  why  we recruited him for the  sports  school\r\n\r\nbecause  we  know  that he will be able to  lead  the  school\r\n\r\ntowards what we want to achieve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I certainly do not disagree with everything that Mr\r\n\r\nTan  has mentioned -  we need to build sports heroes, we need\r\n\r\nto spend a bit more. The $500 million that has been allocated\r\n\r\nby  the  Government and Singapore Pools is  actually  towards\r\n\r\nthat  end.   The  three  pillars that I mentioned  earlier  - sports  excellence, sports for all, sports  industry  -  will\r\n\r\nultimately build towards the kind of excellence that we want.\r\n\r\nI think we have to take the approach of building up the base,\r\n\r\nas  he  has  rightly mentioned, and that we need to  build  a\r\n\r\nsports   culture.  We  are  trying  to  increase  the  sports\r\n\r\nparticipation rate towards 50% by 2005.  We will try as  much\r\n\r\nas  possible to encourage as many people as possible to  take\r\n\r\nup  sports.  We certainly do not disagree with Mr Tan's point\r\n\r\nabout  getting the schools involved.  I am not quite familiar\r\n\r\nwith  some  of  the schools' programmes, but I do  know,  for\r\n\r\nexample, schools, like Saint Andrew's Junior School,  have  a\r\n\r\nvery  intense programme in rugby where some of the  kids  who\r\n\r\ngraduate,  can  go on to Saint Andrew's Secondary  School  so\r\n\r\nthat they can continue with their passion in rugby.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports School will therefore feed off some\r\n\r\nof  the  primary schools which are involved in  some  of  the\r\n\r\nsports programmes that they have undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  hope  to  be  able to attract swimmers  from  the  feeder\r\n\r\nschools that have gone to ACS.  They might consider going  to\r\n\r\nthe  sports  school where intense training will be undertaken\r\n\r\nfor  their passion for swimming and for other sports that  we\r\n\r\nhave  identified  as  important  in  order  to  build  sports\r\n\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in terms of building up sports excellence, we\r\n\r\nare  revamping the National Sports Associations  (NSAs).   Mr\r\n\r\nTan's  feedback that some NSAs have told him that  they  have\r\n\r\nnot seen the effect of the $500 million is because we have to\r\n\r\nbe  very  careful on how we spend this money.  As Mr Tan  has\r\n\r\nmentioned,  accountability is very important.  What  we  have\r\n\r\ndone is to make sure that we have a system in place.  We have\r\n\r\nrecently  launched a system to evaluate the NSAs and classify\r\n\r\nthe  sports according to core, merits and others.  This would\r\n\r\nallow  them to receive different funding levels.  The  system\r\n\r\nis  transparent.  It will allow them to evaluate  where  they\r\n\r\nare  in  terms of the ranking system, and what more  do  they\r\n\r\nneed  to  do  in order to improve.  In all of our discussions\r\n\r\nwith the NSAs, we make it clear that governance is important,\r\n\r\nand  how they must manage the sporting fraternity.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nwe  also  talk about developmental programmes - what are  the\r\n\r\nthings  that they should do in order to develop the  athletes\r\n\r\nunder their charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier in the CoS debate about programmes\r\n\r\nfor  youth  development,  which  the  NSAs  are  supposed  to\r\n\r\nundertake.  In this regard, I would like to add that NSAs are\r\n\r\nalso  working with some of our CDCs to ensure that  we  start\r\n\r\nyoung.  When I was the Mayor of Central Singapore, we started\r\n\r\na  football league for young kids.  We worked through the FAS\r\n\r\nto  get  support  from Home United, which is  located  within\r\n\r\nCentral  Singapore.   The programme is  well-received  by  my\r\n\r\nresidents  at  that time and we have, since then,  started  a\r\n\r\nsecond  centre  in Bishan Stadium. The first  centre  was  at\r\n\r\nBeatty Secondary School. There are efforts along the way,  be\r\n\r\nit  directly through the schools or in collaboration with the\r\n\r\nschools, with the CDCs and the NSAs to encourage more  people\r\n\r\nto take up sports of their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterest.   I  understand that Southeast CDC  has  also  been\r\n\r\nworking   with  Geylang  United  to  bring  sports   to   the\r\n\r\nheartlands,  especially soccer because  there  is  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ninterest, and to start young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third pillar is the sports industry. I agree with\r\n\r\nMr  Tan that we need the base, and people who are prepared to\r\n\r\npay  to  watch and then to support.  Like Mr Tan, I  grew  up\r\n\r\nwith the Kallang Stadium.  I was part of the Kallang roar.  I\r\n\r\nremember those matches.  I think it is very good for us to be\r\n\r\nable to achieve that sort of support.  Earlier this year,  we\r\n\r\nhad  the Singapore Rugby 7. Mr Speaker himself was the  Guest\r\n\r\nof Honour. I was there in my capacity as Sports Minister. The\r\n\r\natmosphere was fantastic.  There was a lot of support.  There\r\n\r\nwere  a lot of expatriate community members because they have\r\n\r\na  passion for rugby.  I suspect beer supplies went  up  over\r\n\r\nthat  weekend, because there was a lot of involvement by  the\r\n\r\ncommunity for that particular event.  The sporting spirit was\r\n\r\nindeed  very remarkable because, at the end of the day,  even\r\n\r\nthough  they  may  be English or other supporters,  but  when\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  game  between  Fiji  and  Samoa,  they  always\r\n\r\nsupported the underdog, and cheered the underdog on. That was\r\n\r\nthe  kind of spirit that I saw, and I think most of us in the\r\n\r\nsporting  fraternity will agree that we want to achieve  that\r\n\r\nkind of level of participation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have anything else to add other than the fact\r\n\r\nthat I agree with him on the kind of fighting spirit that  we\r\n\r\nsee  now  of the old Rafflesians in order to lead the revival\r\n\r\nof  the rugby team in Raffles.  My brother was a rugby player\r\n\r\nfrom RI.  He is also very disappointed.  I am sure Mr Zainul,\r\n\r\nwho  was  his  contemporary  in  RI,  is  also  disappointed.\r\n\r\nSomething  needs to be done. We applaud such  spirit.   Where\r\n\r\npossible, SSC will come in and help the schools, as  we  have\r\n\r\ndone.   As  I  mentioned earlier in my reply, we are  working\r\n\r\nwith schools in order for schools to encourage those who  are\r\n\r\nnormally not keen in taking up sporting activities to engage.\r\n\r\nThese  are  not  competitive sports, but it  allows  them  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  a sport of their interest.  Developing  that\r\n\r\nbase  is  very important.  It is a pyramid.  We  develop  the\r\n\r\nbase and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustry,  so  that we can get people to participate.   As  I\r\n\r\nhave mentioned earlier, we are looking into redeveloping  the\r\n\r\nKallang  Stadium, to revamp it into something which  is  new,\r\n\r\nnot  like  the  old  stadium, something that  can  promote  a\r\n\r\nlifestyle and attract people there throughout the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, in terms of the pyramid at the top, we\r\n\r\nhave, as he has mentioned, the athlete programme, the ACT, to\r\n\r\nhelp  some of our top athletes.  We give them support.   Some\r\n\r\nof  them  have been sent overseas.  I know the recent winner,\r\n\r\nSports  Girl  of  the Year, is now in California,  undergoing\r\n\r\nintensive  swimming  programme while  pursuing  her  studies.\r\n\r\nThese are efforts that we have put in place.  Whether we will\r\n\r\nneed  more money or not the $500 million is there.   We  have\r\n\r\nonly  spent about $35 million.  We have just started,  so  we\r\n\r\nhave  to be very careful.  At the end of five years, we  have\r\n\r\nto go back to Government if we need more, I suppose.  But the\r\n\r\n$500 million does not include the money that we will need  in\r\n\r\norder  to  redevelop  the Kallang Sports  Stadium.   For  the\r\n\r\nmoment,   our  assessment  is  that  $500  million  will   be\r\n\r\nsufficient  for  the next five years for us to  lay  some  of\r\n\r\nthese  foundations.  Beyond that, we will  probably  have  to\r\n\r\nreview, and go back to Government for the funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONCLUSION OF DEBATE IN COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon.

But  I\r\n\r\nrelish the opportunity, really, to address the House, because\r\n\r\nit  gives me the opportunity to thank hon.

Alas, and to my dismay,  not\r\n\r\nonly  does this list remain, I also have had to add new names\r\n\r\nto the number that I have.  Henceforth, one of my missions in\r\n\r\nlife now is to shorten this list as this session progresses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, I have actually enjoyed the debate, despite my\r\n\r\ndemeanour  and  my  body language.  I am impressed  with  the\r\n\r\ndepth,  breadth  and  texture of the  speeches,  and  by  the\r\n\r\nvariety  of  views expressed.
