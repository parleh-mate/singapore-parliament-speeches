The late Mr\r\n\r\nGovindasamy had not been well for more than a year\r\n\r\nand Members are aware of that fact. He could have\r\n\r\nretired last December but he chose to continue to\r\n\r\nserve his constituents, the Party and the trade\r\n\r\nunions. He was re-elected with a thumping majority\r\n\r\nlast December. He was sworn in only last Monday and\r\n\r\nlooked forward so much to taking part in our\r\n\r\nforthcoming debate. What a pity it is that he died\r\n\r\nthis morning in the prime of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Govindasamy was for long a staunch supporter of\r\n\r\nthe  workers and he was their fiery champion in  this\r\n\r\nHouse. They will miss him and so will we. But knowing\r\n\r\nMr  Govindasamy.  I think he would  not  want  us  to\r\n\r\nadjourn for his sake. The funeral will be held  later\r\n\r\nthis afternoon, and those Members who are not due  to\r\n\r\nspeak today can attend the funeral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I place on record, Sir, the deep sympathy of\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House for his loss.

He called upon Members of the House,\r\n\r\nespecially those not holding office, to subject every\r\n\r\nmajor policy to the closest scrutiny. In this current\r\n\r\ndebate we will miss the late Member for Radin Mas. He\r\n\r\nwas a good friend and his was a cheerful presence  in\r\n\r\nthis  House.  Our thoughts must go to his  widow  and\r\n\r\nchildren.  Our  thoughts also today must  go  to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Merah who lies stricken in hospital.\r\n\r\nThose  of us who are present in the House today  will\r\n\r\nsurely  heed  the call of the President  and  do  our\r\n\r\nduty. There is much to debate and there will be  more\r\n\r\nto do afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address, the President warned Singaporeans\r\n\r\nagainst soft options. There have been none. There can\r\n\r\nbe none. Our people have paid their way, all the way.\r\n\r\nThe  General  Elections  of 1  976  demonstrate  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are sophisticated; they reject  attempts\r\n\r\nby  opposition parties to beguile them with  promises\r\n\r\nof \"something for nothing\" and \"everything for less\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More Singaporeans today pay income tax than 10\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  In  1965 only 4% of the population  paid\r\n\r\nincome  tax;  today 8% do so. And the Singaporean  is\r\n\r\npaying more as well. In 1965 he paid, in the form  of\r\n\r\nincome  tax, property tax, estate duty, customs  and\r\n\r\nexcise,  about  l0% of his per capita income.  Today,\r\n\r\nthe Singaporean pays something closer to 20%. Only in\r\n\r\nthis  way  has  it been possible for Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  the quality of life that they do. It is  never\r\n\r\ntrue  that the best things in life are free. We  have\r\n\r\nto  work for them. Teachers do not teach our children\r\n\r\nfor  free. Doctors do not minister to their  patients\r\n\r\nfor  free. The Housing and Development Board does not\r\n\r\ngive   away  apartments.  But  the  productivity   of\r\n\r\nSingaporean  and  their  contribution  to  the  state\r\n\r\ncoffers, make it possible for the state to subsidize,\r\n\r\nnot  give for free, education, medical treatment  and\r\n\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asian societies lay great store by proper\r\n\r\neducation. Singapore is no exception. At the risk  of\r\n\r\nrepeating  the obvious, we must guard against  \"over-education\".\r\n\r\nIn another island-economy. Taiwan,  there\r\n\r\nare  university graduates who do translations to earn\r\n\r\n$2.50  a  day while carpenters earn $25 a  day.  Lest\r\n\r\nMembers  conclude  that this is an Asian  phenomenon,\r\n\r\nthe  \"job crisis\" plagues advanced economies as well.\r\n\r\nIn   France, universities  are  described   as   the\r\n\r\n\"unemployment machine\", because half the graduates in\r\n\r\nrecent  years cannot find jobs. From America  in  the\r\n\r\nnorthern  hemisphere to Australia in the  south,  the\r\n\r\nstory  is  the  same.  We cannot  waste  our  limited\r\n\r\nresources to educate people who do not meet the needs\r\n\r\nof  our  economy. We cannot afford any waste. Of  all\r\n\r\nthe  countries in the world. Singapore  is  the  most\r\n\r\ndependent on imported food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to strike the right balance between\r\n\r\nhigher  standards  of education so  much  desired  by\r\n\r\nparents, and the proper type of education to  provide\r\n\r\ntheir children with a bright future. The Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation   is  to  be  congratulated  on   correctly\r\n\r\nemphasising technical education which includes  trade\r\n\r\nand  artisan  programmes conducted by the  Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining Board. I believe,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhowever,   that  we  must  constantly  ask  ourselves\r\n\r\nwhether  we  are  doing  enough  to  train  Singapore\r\n\r\nprofessionals, in the banks, the insurance companies,\r\n\r\nin  the fields of personnel management and the  like.\r\n\r\nall  of which are vital to the growth of our economy.\r\n\r\nThe   work  of  artisans  must  be  complemented  and\r\n\r\nsupported  by that of professionals. The strength  of\r\n\r\nour economy is vital to our national resilience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the President noted, the Americans have departed\r\n\r\nfrom  Vietnam and Thailand. There are new governments\r\n\r\nin  Vietnam,  Laos  and Cambodia.  There  is  only  a\r\n\r\nresidual and miniscule Western presence in Asia. When\r\n\r\nthe Western powers depart, the political institutions\r\n\r\nthey  leave behind invariably go by the board.  Very,\r\n\r\nvery  few of the countries of Asia and Africa,  which\r\n\r\nbecame independent after World War II, have continued\r\n\r\nto work the democratic system they inherited; such  a\r\n\r\nsystem consists of more than one political party  and\r\n\r\nassumes  the  holding of periodic elections  for  the\r\n\r\npeople to choose their representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, for the third time, the people have\r\n\r\nreturned the PAP to all the seats in this House. Such\r\n\r\na situation is possible in the British Parliament. It\r\n\r\nhas  not  happened,  but that is  another  story.  It\r\n\r\nalmost happened in the then Federation of Malaya. The\r\n\r\nTunku's  party, campaigning on a platform of Merdeka,\r\n\r\nwon 51 of the 52 contested seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members well know, there are variations within\r\n\r\nthe  democratic system as described above.  Countries\r\n\r\nin  the  Commonwealth which adopted  the  Westminster\r\n\r\nmodel   will   find  it  difficult  to  describe   as\r\n\r\ndemocratic a government in which the chief executive,\r\n\r\nthe President, is not elected, nor the Vice-President\r\n\r\nnor  the  Cabinet  Ministers. This was  the  case  in\r\n\r\nAmerica after Watergate. Yet American writers  insist\r\n\r\nthat   democracy   in  America  exists   and   indeed\r\n\r\nflourishes. In that country, for the first  30  years\r\n\r\nafter  1776, there was a loosely-structured one-party\r\n\r\nsystem  of  government.  During  George  Washington's\r\n\r\nfirst   presidency,  all  important  differences   of\r\n\r\nopinion  were expressed within the government  party,\r\n\r\nand the government party\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  a  party of stability, dedicated to  the  belief\r\n\r\nthat  the  first imperative of government  in  a  new\r\n\r\nnation  was to govern and sustain itself. Two  pieces\r\n\r\nof  legislation  passed  in 1798  are  of  particular\r\n\r\ninterest to new nations. The Aliens and Sedition Acts\r\n\r\ngave  the  President the power to order  out  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  any alien whom he thought dangerous  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  peace  or whom he had reasonable  grounds  to\r\n\r\nsuspect  of  plotting  against his  government.  Such\r\n\r\naliens  did not have recourse to courts of  law.  The\r\n\r\nSedition  Act was intended to cope with citizens,  or\r\n\r\naliens,  who  too severely criticised the government.\r\n\r\nIt  was  a  serious offence \"to publish  a  false  or\r\n\r\nmalicious  writing  against  the  Government  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States, the President or Congress  with  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of stirring up hatred or resistance  against\r\n\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps we have more to learn from\r\n\r\nthe   Americans   than  merely  their   science   and\r\n\r\ntechnology,  their  management skills  and  marketing\r\n\r\nknow-how.  But  let  us look ahead.  A  book  on  the\r\n\r\n\"Limits  to  Growth\" listed five basic  factors  that\r\n\r\ndetermine growth on this planet: population increase.\r\n\r\nagricultural   production,   nonrenewable    resource\r\n\r\ndepletion, industrial   output    and    pollution\r\n\r\ngeneration.  On  a global scale, it  is  argued  that\r\n\r\nunless  mankind voluntarily imposes limits to growth.\r\n\r\ndisaster  will follow. Opposite viewpoints exist,  of\r\n\r\ncourse. They argue that conditions in the world  will\r\n\r\nbecome better and brighter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is Singapore headed for? We do not even\r\n\r\npossess two of the factors listed which affect growth\r\n\r\n-  agricultural production and non-renewable resource\r\n\r\ndepletion.   None  of  us  would  want  to   generate\r\n\r\npollution unnecessarily. Must we inevitably reach our\r\n\r\nlimits   to   growth?  Or  can  we  go   on   growing\r\n\r\nindefinitely?  As  a  still  emerging  LDC  (or  less\r\n\r\ndeveloped country), we have no option but to  try  to\r\n\r\ngrow.  Except  population-wise. We have  very  finite\r\n\r\nresources. Ingenuity and technology can overcome some\r\n\r\nof  the  limiting factors. As we run out of  land  to\r\n\r\nbuild  houses, we build high-rise apartments; and  we\r\n\r\nreclaim land from the sea. As we run out of roads, we\r\n\r\ncut\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nback  on cars and we consider travelling underground.\r\n\r\nAs  the growth of our entrepot trade slowed down,  we\r\n\r\nindustrialised;  and we developed banking,  insurance\r\n\r\nand  ancillary services to provide a living  for  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have overcome the limitations of our Island by\r\n\r\nlinking  our national economy with international  and\r\n\r\nregional  economies.  The leadership,  political  and\r\n\r\nbureaucratic, have undoubtably given some thought  to\r\n\r\nthe long-range problems that confront our mini-state.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of  Defence, for  example, for  which\r\n\r\nstrategic  planning is of the utmost  importance, is\r\n\r\nconsidering  National  Service  for  women,  as   the\r\n\r\npopulation  growth  slows down  because  Singaporeans\r\n\r\naccept  that \"Two is Enough\". We have done very  well\r\n\r\nso  far in the face of formidable odds. In the short-run,\r\n\r\nthere will be difficulties, but these  are  not\r\n\r\ninsurmountable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what of the long-term? Let all of us in this\r\n\r\nHouse,  and others outside who are in the  public  as\r\n\r\nwell as in the private sectors, give more serious and\r\n\r\nsustained consideration to our long-term development.\r\n\r\nThe  discussion of matters of our economic well-being\r\n\r\nleads  us  to  what I believe to be the  nub  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident's Address, which also received attention in\r\n\r\nthe  several  Addenda  of  the  Prime  Minister,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education and the Minister for Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are told what we must not do as a\r\n\r\npeople. We must \"not abandon the cardinal precepts of\r\n\r\nour long-proven culture systems\". We must not seek to\r\n\r\nmodel   our   lives  on  \"Western  mores  and   their\r\n\r\ncontemporary  life-styles\".  Our  children  will   be\r\n\r\ntaught not to adopt the \"life-style and values of the\r\n\r\nWest  that  are  alien  and pernicious  to  Singapore\r\n\r\nsociety.\"  We  are  advised to \"unequivocably  uphold\r\n\r\nAsian  precepts\" and to provide our  young  with  the\r\n\r\n\"necessary  cultural ballast against the  erosion  of\r\n\r\ntraditional norms and values\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what are these important, desirable things? The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister tells us what we ought not to be;  we\r\n\r\ncannot  be  \"a  simple copying of either  China, the\r\n\r\nMalaysian archipelago, or India, from whence most of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour ancestors came. Nor can we be a copy of Britain.\"\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  for  Culture  enjoins  us  to  develop\r\n\r\nSingapore's \"rich cultural heritage derived from  the\r\n\r\nMalay,  Chinese,  Indian  and western  civilisations,\r\n\r\nand,  through their cross-fertilization, to evolve  a\r\n\r\nnational   identity.\"  The  Minister  for   Education\r\n\r\nbelieves  that he has an action plan - \"to  inculcate\r\n\r\nsocial discipline and national identity and to  imbue\r\n\r\nin pupils moral and civic values\" through the subject\r\n\r\ncalled Education For Living. I am happy that we  have\r\n\r\nbegun to discuss this crucial subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have far to go before Singaporeans possess\r\n\r\ncharacteristics   that   can   identify    them    as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, that  set us apart  from  others.  For\r\n\r\nSingapore   to  thrive,  we  have  to   engender   in\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  an intense and passionate devotion  and\r\n\r\nlove  for  country.  This cannot be  legislated  into\r\n\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a student, I recall seeing a film based on the\r\n\r\nlife  of  Chopin, composer, and pianist. He quit  his\r\n\r\nhomeland. He won fame. He enjoyed himself. He was the\r\n\r\n\"constant companion\" of the leading woman's libber of\r\n\r\nthe age. One day, a Polish thought struck him. He was\r\n\r\nreminded   that   his  country  lay   under   foreign\r\n\r\ndomination  and that his compatriots were  suffering.\r\n\r\nTo  bring  home to Chopin the fact that he seemed  to\r\n\r\nhave  forgotten his country, his visitor poured  into\r\n\r\nhis  hands a little bag of earth brought from Poland.\r\n\r\nAnd  Chopin wept as he saw and felt his native  soil.\r\n\r\nHe  gave  concerts to raise money for  his  country's\r\n\r\nstruggle  for  freedom. And in so  doing  ruined  his\r\n\r\nhealth and died. It is a romantic story but it is the\r\n\r\npatriotism that matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was therefore saddened to hear over RTS the other\r\n\r\nnight  that  three  of our National Service  officers\r\n\r\n(two  of  them  medical doctors and one a  university\r\n\r\nstudent)  called up for National Service had  shirked\r\n\r\ntheir  responsibility. These men have no  patriotism.\r\n\r\nThey took all that Singapore can give them. Then they\r\n\r\npacked up and quit. They had put self above all else.\r\n\r\nThese   few  are  exceptions  but  they  were   well-instructed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we go about inculcating patriotism? We start\r\n\r\nwithout  some of the advantages enjoyed by other  and\r\n\r\nolder  nations, such as a historical state with  some\r\n\r\nclaims  to greatness, the existence of some inspiring\r\n\r\nmonuments,  memories  of  a  long, heroic   struggle\r\n\r\nagainst  foreign invaders and colonizers.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nhave the answers. But the answer does not lie in  the\r\n\r\nmisbegotten subject Education For Living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that our children, in addition to knowing\r\n\r\ntheir  mother tongue, must also learn the history  of\r\n\r\nthe  countries whence their ancestors came, why  they\r\n\r\ncame,  what they had to endure, what factors  enabled\r\n\r\nthem  to survive, to develop and to prosper, and  how\r\n\r\nthey  have come to found a nation - Singapore. Indeed,\r\n\r\nas   a  matter  of  deliberate  policy,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nencourage  our children to identify with  places  and\r\n\r\nevents, and especially people in Singapore. Who  was\r\n\r\nCheang Hong Lim who had a square named after him  and\r\n\r\nwho  until  recently was represented in  this  House?\r\n\r\nWhat  of  Hoo Ah Kay, popularly known as  Whampoa, a\r\n\r\nname  given to an electoral division, which was  once\r\n\r\neliminated, then resuscitated? Many Members represent\r\n\r\nconstituencies  named after people whose  lives  have\r\n\r\nmeaning, interest and instruction for our young, such\r\n\r\nas  Aljunied, Braddell, Kuo Chuan and Mountbatten.  I\r\n\r\nmust  not  forget MacPherson constituency represented\r\n\r\nby the Minister for Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we have a shared and active knowledge of our\r\n\r\npast  as  a means to appreciate the contributions  of\r\n\r\nthe  people who settled here, then we can dream of  a\r\n\r\ncommon  future. When will Singaporeans begin to  have\r\n\r\nsuch  a  dream? A dream such as an American  freedom-fighter\r\n\r\nhad. Martin Luther King in his  most  famous\r\n\r\nspeech, made just before he was assassinated, said,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in\r\n\r\nthe  American  dream   I have a dream  that  my  four\r\n\r\nlittle  children will one day live in a nation  where\r\n\r\nthey  will not be judged by the colour of their skin,\r\n\r\nbut by the content of their character.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last one dozen years we\r\n\r\nhave begun to build a new Singapore, independent  and\r\n\r\nsovereign. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nphysical   landscape   has  changed   almost   beyond\r\n\r\nrecognition in many parts of our island. However, our\r\n\r\nchildren  need  to  possess a  common  hope  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture, a  vision  common to them all,  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ndream, which   will  inspire   them,   create   new\r\n\r\nsensitivities  and  release their energies  to  build\r\n\r\nupon  what  we have already achieved. Then  when  our\r\n\r\nchildren  raise their glasses to a toast Wo  Kuo  Wan\r\n\r\nSuay  they  will be pledging, \"My country, will  live\r\n\r\n10,000 years\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin  support  of  the  Motion of the  Member  for  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the Elections of 1976 showed that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  received  strong  support  from  the\r\n\r\nworking  classes including those who were  relatively\r\n\r\nless  well-off, for example, those who lived in  one-room\r\n\r\nflats in HDB premises. The Ministry  of  Labour\r\n\r\nreport  of  the labour force survey. 1976,  indicated\r\n\r\nthat  27% of employed persons received under  $200  a\r\n\r\nmonth, while 42% received between $200-$399, and this\r\n\r\namounts  to nearly 70% of the population of  employed\r\n\r\npersons. And it could not have been but that the bulk\r\n\r\nof  these  people and their family connections  voted\r\n\r\nfor us. It should therefore be the Government's right\r\n\r\naim to continue to devote as much of its resources as\r\n\r\npossible towards improving the lot of these people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last elections, some opposition\r\n\r\ncandidates moved hither and thither chattering  about\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  caring society as though this Government\r\n\r\ndid  not  care  for  the people. Included  among  the\r\n\r\ngoodies  many  opposition candidates were  trying  to\r\n\r\nsell  was  the offer of subsidised living. Correctly,\r\n\r\nas  the  Member for Ulu Pandan has pointed  out,  the\r\n\r\nvoters  refused  to  buy  this.  It  is  not  through\r\n\r\nsentimental concepts that the quality of life of  our\r\n\r\npeople  is best improved but that our compassion  for\r\n\r\nour  people  should be the basis of  sound,  careful,\r\n\r\ndetermined planning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  execution of policy to bring about  improvements\r\n\r\nfor our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the years since 1959 through a careful\r\n\r\nhusbanding of our resources, spending has  been  made\r\n\r\npossible  on improved provisions towards  building  a\r\n\r\nbetter  society  all  round.  Whatever  the  area  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  effort  a Member of Parliament  may  find\r\n\r\nhimself  particularly interested in,  he  can  assure\r\n\r\nhimself  of  significant successes achieved  in  that\r\n\r\nparticular area of Government activity. For  example.\r\n\r\nI  have  been  particularly interested in educational\r\n\r\ndevelopment and I have tried to make myself a  little\r\n\r\nknowledgeable regarding Government's efforts in  this\r\n\r\narea.  There  is  no  doubt  that  by  any  criteria.\r\n\r\nincluding those applied by foreign education experts.\r\n\r\nthe  Government's achievements in education have been\r\n\r\nimpressive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burden of the Education Ministry, in the\r\n\r\naddendum, is  the  qualitative  improvement  of  our\r\n\r\neducation  provision, which can only be a consequence\r\n\r\nof  the Government's past practical achievements, one\r\n\r\nof which most people think has been in overcoming the\r\n\r\nproblem  of numbers by giving a place to every  child\r\n\r\nin  primary  school.  Certainly  this  has  been  one\r\n\r\nattainment  but,  in my mind, one of the  outstanding\r\n\r\nachievements  has  been in the breakthrough,  number-wise\r\n\r\nas  well as in terms of the diversification  of\r\n\r\nprovisions,  in the area of secondary  schooling.  In\r\n\r\n1959,  the  percentage of persons of the correct  age\r\n\r\nenrolled  in primary schools was 88%. In  1975, this\r\n\r\npercentage  rose to over 98%. In 1959, the percentage\r\n\r\nof  persons  of  correct  age enrolled  in  secondary\r\n\r\nschools  was  19% while in 1975 the  number  rose  to\r\n\r\nabout  50%. More significantly Secondary I enrolments\r\n\r\nincreased from 11.5% in 1959 to nearly 55%  in  1975.\r\n\r\nnamely  the enrolment in Secondary I rose from  about\r\n\r\n4.000  to  over 30,000. While Primary I enrolment  of\r\n\r\nthose  persons aged 6 increased by nearly 27% between\r\n\r\n1959  and  1975, the enrolment  in  Secondary  I  of\r\n\r\npersons  aged 12 increased by more than 7 1/2 times.  As\r\n\r\nsecondary education was closely related to better job\r\n\r\nopportunities, does this not show how practically and\r\n\r\nrealistically the Government cared?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, the then Finance Minister who is now\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister showed with  what  dismay  he\r\n\r\nviewed  the  problem of providing education  for  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  number  of  children  having  to   attend\r\n\r\nschool.  The  Minister said [Hansard, Vol.  11,  col. 785, 25.11.59]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The large number of babies born every year may be a\r\n\r\nwelcome  testimony to the virility of the  population\r\n\r\nbut   it   Sets  in  Store  problems  of  nightmarish\r\n\r\nproportions for the Finance Minister.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this not display anxiety? Does this not show\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government cared in such a  way  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment showed itself financewise firmly committed\r\n\r\nto  educational development? From 1960 to the present\r\n\r\nyear, allocations for education have shown continuous\r\n\r\ngrowth. In 1964, despite a fall in the GNP and also a\r\n\r\nfall  in  Government recurrent expenditure generally.\r\n\r\neducational recurrent expenditure went up  9.2%  over\r\n\r\nthe previous year's expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other MPs who are interested in other fields may\r\n\r\nwell record the same sense of responsible concern  in\r\n\r\nother areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from concern being expressed in policy\r\n\r\naction  there are indications, throughout the various\r\n\r\naddenda of more specifically humane considerations  -\r\n\r\nfor  example: the concern for industrial  safety  and\r\n\r\nhealth expressed in the very concrete steps that  are\r\n\r\nbeing  planned,  including the  establishment  of  an\r\n\r\noccupational   safety  and  health   institute;   the\r\n\r\nthinking  manifested in the intention of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Health to lay greater emphasis on primary  health\r\n\r\ncare, preventive medicine and health education;  the\r\n\r\nsympathy  for  the old expressed in the establishment\r\n\r\nof   the   home  nursing  foundation.  Such  measures\r\n\r\nillustrate  a  practical concern for  people, not  a\r\n\r\nsentimental indulgence in vague expressions of care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, going through the various addenda to\r\n\r\nthe  President's Address, one is struck by  the  very\r\n\r\ntangible, material, concrete, rational,  hard-headed\r\n\r\nproposals  outlined. Although the addenda  relate  to\r\n\r\ngeneral policy declarations, we can read\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout   percentage  growth, extension  of   national\r\n\r\nservice   to  women,  National  Wages  Council,   the\r\n\r\nexpansion of the domestic telephone network,  and  so\r\n\r\non,  including even the trite (but still  particular)\r\n\r\nintention  of  the Ministry of Science  to  launch  a\r\n\r\nfollow-up to the Science and Industry Quiz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when we stray to some areas covered by the\r\n\r\naddenda  on the Education and Culture Ministries,  we\r\n\r\nfind  that  we have wandered into a rather misty,  if\r\n\r\nnot  actually foggy environment, where the  landscape\r\n\r\nhas  become diffused, and the configuration a  little\r\n\r\nblurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture is concerned with evolving\r\n\r\na   national  cultural  identity  and  will  organise\r\n\r\nactivities  to promote a better appreciation  of  our\r\n\r\ncultural  heritage,  and in the process  protect  our\r\n\r\nyoung  against the erosion of traditional  norms  and\r\n\r\nvalues. Later on, Sir, when we come to the debate  in\r\n\r\nthe Committee of Supply, I hope we will hear from the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned, the specifics of such action  as\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry  intends to take. I  remember,  Sir,  a\r\n\r\nbitter  complaint from an official  of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation about what a budget official once  asked.\r\n\r\nIt seems that at a meeting with budget officials, the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association representative stated that  his\r\n\r\nagency  was involved in efforts to build a  sense  of\r\n\r\nnational identity, and inculcate the right values  in\r\n\r\nour  people. The Treasury official was very impressed\r\n\r\nand  asked the PA official how many good Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthe  PA  had  produced. Perhaps the  question  was  a\r\n\r\nheartless one, but it indicates the difficulty  of  a\r\n\r\nhard assessment of this thing called \"values\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this difficulty, Sir, we find the addendum\r\n\r\non  the  Ministry of Education declaring  that  great\r\n\r\npains will be taken to ensure that pupils imbibe  the\r\n\r\ntried, not simply tried and tested Asian cultural and\r\n\r\nmoral  values but the tried and tested Asian cultural\r\n\r\nand moral values. I shall ask the Ministry to tell me\r\n\r\nsince  they  appear  to have already  identified  the\r\n\r\ntried and tested virtues, what these virtues are  and\r\n\r\nhow they propose to teach these values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the pillars of development\r\n\r\nin  our  society has been the success in  our  family\r\n\r\nplanning policy. With an appropriate reduction in the\r\n\r\ngrowth of our population we are now able to plan  for\r\n\r\nmeasures  more  effectively, measures that  it  would\r\n\r\nhave  been difficult to envisage as possible even  10\r\n\r\nyears ago, because money that we will now be able  to\r\n\r\nspend on these measures would otherwise have gone  on\r\n\r\nthe  spending of less and less money on more and more\r\n\r\npeople.  Yet in some ways family planning would  have\r\n\r\ngone  against the traditional grain. Family  planning\r\n\r\nis  a  modern  idea in the sense it  is  administered\r\n\r\ntoday. Traditional agrarian cultures (whether east or\r\n\r\nwest) would extol the virtues of a large family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show that values may be difficult to determine.\r\n\r\nand undergo change, let us just observe what they are\r\n\r\ndoing  to Confucius in China today. They are  calling\r\n\r\nhim  sage  of  the  reactionary classes.  Yesterday's\r\n\r\nConfucian  stipulation  of  three  cardinal   guides,\r\n\r\nnamely, that subject must be guided by sovereign, son\r\n\r\nmust be guided by father, and wife must be guided  by\r\n\r\nhusband, has  been described in Mao-thought  as  the\r\n\r\nauthorities   -   political,   clan   and   masculine\r\n\r\nauthorities  - that are the embodiment of  the  whole\r\n\r\nfeudal  system  and  ideology  and  the  thick  ropes\r\n\r\nbinding   the   Chinese  people,   particularly   the\r\n\r\npeasants.  It is interesting to note how the  Chinese\r\n\r\ntoday reject male chauvinism - a point that this all-male\r\n\r\nhouse might find worthy to note. In China again,\r\n\r\ntoday,   the  ideologues  have  attributed  a  highly\r\n\r\nsinister political motivation to the Confucian aim of\r\n\r\nYu chiao wu /ui which was traditionally taken to mean\r\n\r\ngiving education irrespective of class barriers. This\r\n\r\nhas  been described by Chinese communists as  humbug,\r\n\r\nas  they think that Confucian modes were designed  to\r\n\r\nmake  the masses pliable instruments in the hands  of\r\n\r\nthe rulers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when you think of literature as containing\r\n\r\nlessons,  in a spate of criticism of Water Margin  in\r\n\r\n1975,  Chairman Mao was noted as having  pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat the merit of the book Water Margin lay precisely\r\n\r\nin the portrayal of capitulation - meaning, of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse,  capitulation to the feudal  principles;  and\r\n\r\nMao  pointed  out  that  Water  Margin  served  as  a\r\n\r\nteaching material by negative example to help all the\r\n\r\npeople  recognise capitulationism.  Even  Ge  un  suo\r\n\r\nneng, an  lao fen p'ei will change if the  communist\r\n\r\nmillennium is attained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk of values, therefore, let us talk of\r\n\r\nvalues - for what purposes, just like the Chinese  in\r\n\r\nChina  today  discuss their values in  terms  of  the\r\n\r\npolitical   aims  and  in  terms  of  the   practical\r\n\r\ncondition of their society today. What is the kind of\r\n\r\nsociety  we want to develop? Let us start  with  this\r\n\r\nidea that we want a society that is reasonably secure\r\n\r\nand  properly educated with reasonable prospects  for\r\n\r\neconomic  advancement. We therefore  stress  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment, dissemination of modern techniques  and\r\n\r\nrational attitudes with full exploitation of the mass\r\n\r\nmedia  to  disseminate those attitudes and to  change\r\n\r\ntraditional  outlooks  that  stand  in  the  path  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  in  the path of  modernisation.  We\r\n\r\nrealise  the  importance  of  industrialisation   and\r\n\r\nurbanisation,  the  establishment  of  a   management\r\n\r\nelite,  bureaucratisation  that  is  necessary,   the\r\n\r\nespousal  of  analytic intelligent  modes  of  social\r\n\r\nappraisal, the  inculcation of  a  sense  of  common\r\n\r\ndestiny  and belonging and the inculcation of  humane\r\n\r\nand  loyal regard as between one citizen and another.\r\n\r\nI do not think that this is an unreasonable statement\r\n\r\nof social aim for Singapore. But whether people agree\r\n\r\nwith  me  totally, or disagree with what I have  said\r\n\r\npartially or even totally, there must be a social aim\r\n\r\nunderlying  the kind of values we want  to  give  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be illustrated by the experience of Japan.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  Japanese experienced the  emergence  of  a\r\n\r\nmodern constitutional government and the build-up  of\r\n\r\ntheir  administrative  system  of  a  modern  unified\r\n\r\nstate, the education system underwent changes.  There\r\n\r\nemerged  a two-tier structure of education  in  which\r\n\r\nelementary  education confined to basic literacy  and\r\n\r\nnumeracy   attached  importance  to   ethics,   moral\r\n\r\neducation  to  foster  Japanese  citizens  who  would\r\n\r\nacquire the ethics of the family system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   pledge  allegiance  to  the  family   and   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  At  the  apex,  the  educational   system\r\n\r\npositively  adopted  the modern civilisation  of  the\r\n\r\nWest,  emphasised  science,  developed  an  elite  to\r\n\r\nengage  in  the  operation of modern  technology  and\r\n\r\nmanagerial organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasise. Sir, that in their basic\r\n\r\neducation, the Japanese emphasised the importance  of\r\n\r\nfostering  Japanese values. In our  case  instead  of\r\n\r\nstressing Singapore references, as the Member for Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan  has  recommended, we are  thinking  of  Asian\r\n\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I have very serious doubts as to whether such a\r\n\r\nthing  as \"Asian values\" really exist... It may exist\r\n\r\nas  an  image but it has no reality. If  it  has  any\r\n\r\nmeaning  at  all  it  is merely a convenient  way  of\r\n\r\ndescribing the heterogeneous, conflicting and complex\r\n\r\nnetwork  of beliefs, prejudices and values  developed\r\n\r\nin the countries which for geographical purposes have\r\n\r\nbeen grouped as being in Asia'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are not my words, although I agree fully\r\n\r\nwith them. These words constitute a quotation from  a\r\n\r\nrecent  publication. Asian Values and  Modernisation.\r\n\r\npage  95, and belong to our own Foreign Minister  who\r\n\r\ngoes on later to emphasise that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`there is much in traditional values (whether Asian,\r\n\r\nWestern  or  African) which are far more  modern  and\r\n\r\nmore  likely  to  give impetus to modernisation  than\r\n\r\nsome contemporary values.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am making is that we have to ponder and\r\n\r\nselect, and the basis is what I have already referred\r\n\r\nto  -  relevance to Singapore's development  and  her\r\n\r\npeople's harmonious living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a further point has to be made. It is not\r\n\r\nonly  the  children in our schools  who  need  to  be\r\n\r\neducated   to   values   that  will   contribute   to\r\n\r\nSingapore's development and the harmonious living  of\r\n\r\nour  people. The adult citizens of our Republic  have\r\n\r\nto  be  continually exposed to the play of influences\r\n\r\nthat  will  result  in  further  improvement  to  our\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sooner we get rid of the idea that education is\r\n\r\nprincipally the responsibility of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Education Ministry, or that education takes place\r\n\r\nin a certain location, for example, schools, within a\r\n\r\ncertain period in a day, viz, according to the  class\r\n\r\ntime-table, on certain days, that is those  that  are\r\n\r\nnot  school holidays - the sooner we get rid of  this\r\n\r\nidea  that  education is confined to a certain  place\r\n\r\nand time, the better. It is our people as a whole who\r\n\r\nneed  continuing education, not only those of  school\r\n\r\nage.  In  Singapore those who are receiving education\r\n\r\nor  who  have recently received education are exposed\r\n\r\nto  a whole weight of influence of those who have not\r\n\r\nbeen fortunate recipients of much schooling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study of the Labour Ministry's report on the\r\n\r\nlabour  force survey, 1976, would show  that  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  number of persons over 10 years  of  age,  23%\r\n\r\nhave received secondary education and beyond. At  the\r\n\r\nsame time. 23% have never attended school. The higher\r\n\r\nthe age group the higher the percentage of those with\r\n\r\nlittle  schooling or none at all. I have learnt  from\r\n\r\nthe   Social  Welfare  Department  that   they   have\r\n\r\nestimated that for 1974, among the population over 50\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n94%  had less than secondary education while 83%  had\r\n\r\nno qualifications attained whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, out of a total of over 910,000 economically\r\n\r\nactive  persons, of those under 30, 48% have received\r\n\r\nschooling  up  to secondary school and beyond,  while\r\n\r\nonly  3 1/2%  have never attended school.  This  is  our\r\n\r\nachievement. However, of those above 40,  1 5%  have\r\n\r\nreceived schooling up to secondary level and  beyond,\r\n\r\nwhile 45% have never attended school. In addition, of\r\n\r\nthose above 40 in the economically active population,\r\n\r\n40%  have less than secondary education. This  is  in\r\n\r\naddition  to the 45% who have never attended  school.\r\n\r\nIf  we  assume  that  one of our treasured  Confucian\r\n\r\nvalues still prevails - that of the influence of  the\r\n\r\nelders  over  younger persons - then we  must  reckon\r\n\r\nwith  the  problem of the influence of the relatively\r\n\r\nunschooled  over  the relatively better  schooled.  I\r\n\r\nmust  make  it  clear  that those  with  less  formal\r\n\r\nschooling can and do certainly convey good values  to\r\n\r\nour  younger  citizens. But the  pace  of  change  in\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmakes  it necessary for those in the older age groups\r\n\r\nto  be continually exposed to such influences as will\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the harmonious growth of our  society.\r\n\r\nAnd  in  my mind, the Education Ministry may well  be\r\n\r\nthe   least  qualified  to  perform  this  task.  The\r\n\r\nEducation Ministry does not even seem to be  able  to\r\n\r\nhighlight  effectively  the work  of  its  own  Adult\r\n\r\nEducation Board, judging by the \"press\" the  AEB  was\r\n\r\ngiven in the addendum on the Education Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, other Ministries have seemed to understand\r\n\r\nbetter  the  importance of continuing education.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance has contributed significantly  to\r\n\r\neducational  investment through  its  joint  training\r\n\r\nschemes,  and other programmes; and we see  from  its\r\n\r\naddendum  that  it will spend more  on  its  training\r\n\r\ncentres,  and  that  it has a programme  in  view  to\r\n\r\ninduce  owners  or managers of small  enterprises  to\r\n\r\nlearn to optimise use of personnel and equipment  and\r\n\r\nimprove marketing capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Ministry of Labour has its Productivity\r\n\r\nBoard   which  will  help  further  in  training   of\r\n\r\nsupervisors    and   junior   and   middle-management\r\n\r\nexecutives.  The Ministry of Health  has  stated  its\r\n\r\nobjective  of  organising  regular  national   health\r\n\r\ncampaigns;  I  have  no  doubt that  the  Environment\r\n\r\nMinistry which as a training and education department\r\n\r\nhas its own programmes of public instruction which  I\r\n\r\nhope  will  include education in the  area  of  anti-pollution\r\n\r\nmeasures. And, of course, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture as we have seen has its own activities geared\r\n\r\ntowards the cultural development of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing indicates that we have a very\r\n\r\nefficient   infrastructure,  spread  throughout   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  network, for public  education.  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  there is one theme that this network should  go\r\n\r\nall  out to stress, and that is, the Singaporean  has\r\n\r\nto  be given example in as many ways as possible, of\r\n\r\nhow  he  has to balance his own self-interest against\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of the other person,  for  this  other\r\n\r\nperson represents the interest of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be done in many tangible ways. For example,\r\n\r\nin the civil service and statutory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbodies  -  I  know they are working hard  on  this  -\r\n\r\nefforts  should be made constantly to  temper  action\r\n\r\nwith humane consideration. It should be made clear to\r\n\r\nmotorists  prone  to selfishness and irresponsibility\r\n\r\nthat  they  will not get away, as they are  doing  in\r\n\r\nlarge   numbers, with  what  we   should   consider\r\n\r\nunSingaporean  behaviour. Those  employers,  managers\r\n\r\nand  supervisors  whose negligence or  even  lack  of\r\n\r\nforethought has caused industrial accidents  or  ill-health\r\n\r\nshould  be  given  their  own   lessons   on\r\n\r\nconsideration  and responsibility. At  the  level  of\r\n\r\norganisation of neighbourhood groups in HDB and other\r\n\r\nareas,  the  emphasis should be on consideration  and\r\n\r\ncooperation.  Here  the question  of  noise  nuisance\r\n\r\narises.   Perhaps   the  Government   could   explore\r\n\r\nthoroughly  the feasibility of stricter measures  and\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  combat noise  pollution.  Those  who\r\n\r\noffend  in other forms of pollution should be brought\r\n\r\nto book with despatch. In all these areas, Government\r\n\r\nagencies  should set a special example. We must  also\r\n\r\nremember that in national service everything must  be\r\n\r\ndone to instil in national servicemen a proper regard\r\n\r\nfor one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the improved deployment of police national\r\n\r\nservicemen  to fight crime, the quality of  behaviour\r\n\r\nof people towards one another should improve with the\r\n\r\nadded  sense  of security gained. And we  should  not\r\n\r\nforget  our old people. Many of our very old  people.\r\n\r\nbecause  many  of  them  were foreign-born,  have  no\r\n\r\nrelatives or few people to depend on. The burden will\r\n\r\nnot be great for the State to give greater assistance\r\n\r\nto such cases, although we should stress that the old\r\n\r\nshould  be taken care of by their children or nearest\r\n\r\nrelatives, as far as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir,I refer to the expressed intention of\r\n\r\nFinance  to introduce a new style budget. It  is  not\r\n\r\nclear  what the details are, and I hope you  are  not\r\n\r\nthinking  that I have made a startling jump from  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  inculcation  of  human  values  to  the\r\n\r\nquestion of budget. Actually, Sir,I suspect that our\r\n\r\nnew  style budget will contain elements of  what  has\r\n\r\nbeen  described  as  Programme,  Planning,  Budgeting\r\n\r\nSystem    (PPBS).   This   system   was   at    first\r\n\r\nenthusiastically adopted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  United  States during  the  time  of  Lyndon\r\n\r\nJohnson  who  thought  of this  system  as  a  modern\r\n\r\nmanagement tool that would enable a finer life to  be\r\n\r\nbrought to every American at the least possible cost.\r\n\r\nThe expectations were inflated. However, for whatever\r\n\r\nbudget  system we adopt, there will still remain  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  for  good interpersonal relations  between\r\n\r\nFinance officials and officials from other ministries\r\n\r\nin  order  to make the system work. Here  is  another\r\n\r\narea  where  good  example  of  Singaporeans  working\r\n\r\ntogether may be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nfully support the Motion moved by the Membei for  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan in expressing our thanks to the President  for\r\n\r\nhis Address at the opening of this Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general tenor of the President's Address and\r\n\r\nthe various ministerial policy statements is that  we\r\n\r\nmust  work  even  harder, keep  costs  in  check,  be\r\n\r\nvigilant,  so  that we may achieve a modest  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate of 6-8% per annum. Few Singaporeans,  if\r\n\r\nany,   should   dispute  this  and   the   underlying\r\n\r\nphilosophy of the Government, \"From each his best, to\r\n\r\neach his worth\", as we in Singapore are like men in a\r\n\r\nboat  rowing upstream. We have to keep on rowing just\r\n\r\nto remain stationary. To make progress we have to row\r\n\r\nwith  all  our might. If we stop rowing  we  will  be\r\n\r\npushed  back  by the current. This is the inescapable\r\n\r\nfact of life of nations without natural resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresidential Address has not stated whether the  6-8%\r\n\r\nexpected  growth  rate is real growth  or  growth  in\r\n\r\nmonetary terms. I presume it is the former. Still, it\r\n\r\nwould  be  interesting to know what sort of inflation\r\n\r\nrate  has  been allowed for. The world is fearful  of\r\n\r\nanother  bout of inflation. Inflation hits  different\r\n\r\npeople  with different force. It may be good for  the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen but it crushes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe salaried employees and the lower income group. In\r\n\r\nreviving the vitality of our economy, it is  my  hope\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  being  done  without  the  orchestral\r\n\r\naccompaniment of inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also do not know whether the expected growth in\r\n\r\nthe country will be export-led or generated mainly by\r\n\r\ndomestic  pump-priming. We know,  however,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will make finance for exports more  easily\r\n\r\navailable.  This is a correct step. It  is  important\r\n\r\nthat   future  growth  in  Singapore  be  export-led.\r\n\r\nSingapore  has always recorded a chronic  deficit  in\r\n\r\nmerchandise trade. This is not worrying per se as  we\r\n\r\nhave no natural resources and must import most of the\r\n\r\nthings  we  need. What is worrying, however,  is  the\r\n\r\ncontinuous  growth  of the deficit.  Our  merchandise\r\n\r\ntrade  balance recorded, for example,  a  deficit  of\r\n\r\n$3.0 billion in 1972. In 1975, it has doubled to over\r\n\r\n$6.0   billion.  The  deterioration  can  be   partly\r\n\r\nattributed  to  world-wide inflation  and  the  sharp\r\n\r\nincrease in crude-oil prices. But it also signals the\r\n\r\nneed to pay more attention to exports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, however, our balance of payments is\r\n\r\nhealthy.  It  has  a  surplus of  $700  million, for\r\n\r\nexample, in 1974, though this was reduced  in  1975.\r\n\r\nThe  strength of our international payments situation\r\n\r\nis reflected in the strength of our currency. But the\r\n\r\nstrength of our balance of payments is derived mainly\r\n\r\nfrom  the capital account, owing principally  to  the\r\n\r\ninflow  of foreign investment and foreign funds.  But\r\n\r\nwe  cannot always expect foreign investments to  flow\r\n\r\nin in abundance. The point which I wish to make here.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, is that as a people we must  export\r\n\r\nin  order  to  pay for our imports. We cannot  always\r\n\r\ndepend  on  capital  inflows.  If  Japan,  which  has\r\n\r\nrelatively little natural resources, can have current\r\n\r\naccount  surpluses, so can we, provided we work  hard\r\n\r\nfor  it.  I suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that Government\r\n\r\nhighlights  the  performance of our domestic  exports\r\n\r\njust as we always highlight economic growth rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move now to a problem associated with economic\r\n\r\ngrowth   -   job-hopping.  I   note   that   official\r\n\r\ndisincentives are now being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsidered to discourage job-hopping. Job-hopping  is\r\n\r\nnot  an  easy problem to tackle, for whilst we should\r\n\r\ndiscourage  job-hopping, defined simply as  too  many\r\n\r\nfrivolous job changes in too short a time, we  should\r\n\r\nnot strangle genuine labour mobility. In an expanding\r\n\r\neconomy  with  new industries being set  up,  labour.\r\n\r\nlike  all  resources, must be efficiently  allocated.\r\n\r\nThe  market mechanism, the invisible hand, generally\r\n\r\nallocates  economic resources amongst competing  uses\r\n\r\neffectively.  The  more perfect the market  mechanism\r\n\r\nthe  better. Job-hopping is, therefore, a consequence\r\n\r\nof  too rapid an economic growth more than a cause of\r\n\r\neconomic  ills. Let me make it clear that  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsupporting job-hopping - I am against it, but if job-hopping\r\n\r\nbecomes a national disease, we  should  not\r\n\r\njust  stop  it through legislation - we  should  look\r\n\r\ninto the cause of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour turnover should, therefore, be monitored. I\r\n\r\nam  not sure that this is being done. I would like to\r\n\r\nsuggest  here a source for improving the  timeliness.\r\n\r\nrange  and  quality  of  labour  statistics.  As  all\r\n\r\nemployers   have  to  make  Central  Provident   Fund\r\n\r\ncontributions on behalf of their employees, this is a\r\n\r\ngood  source for labour statistics. This  source  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  sufficiently tapped and much labour  force\r\n\r\ndata  which  could be a by-product of CPF collections\r\n\r\nhave to be separately collected. Admittedly, the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard  does  not  require labour  statistics  in  the\r\n\r\nadministration   of  its  responsibilities   and   is\r\n\r\ntherefore   understandingly   reluctant   to    incur\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for  its  own  account  to  capture  and\r\n\r\nprocess  labour  data for use in the  formulation  of\r\n\r\nnational labour and economic policies. I suggest  the\r\n\r\nGovernment look into the possibility of using the CPF\r\n\r\nmachinery to compile salient data on labour  for  use\r\n\r\nin   economic  and  manpower  planning.   No   doubt,\r\n\r\nexpenditure beyond the requirement of CPF  will  have\r\n\r\nto  be  incurred. Government should bear  this  extra\r\n\r\ncost,  if  necessary, and not let this be the  reason\r\n\r\nfor preserving the status quo. A Minister's judgement\r\n\r\nis  no  better than his information. In other  words,\r\n\r\nwrong  economic policies through lack of  prompt  and\r\n\r\nreliable data are more costly than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure incurred on the collection  of  such\r\n\r\nnationally important statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to maritime and port services, I note\r\n\r\nwith surprise that the Ministry of Communications  is\r\n\r\ndeveloping   new   transportation  technologies   and\r\n\r\nfacilities  to  \"regain Singapore's position  as  the\r\n\r\nregional  warehousing  and  transhipment  centre\".  I\r\n\r\nthought  we have always remained pre-eminent  in  our\r\n\r\nposition as a regional transhipment centre.  I  never\r\n\r\nrealized we have lost our status! But let us be  even\r\n\r\nbolder  and  more imaginative and not stop  short  at\r\n\r\nbeing  just a regional transhipment centre.  We  can,\r\n\r\nbecause   of   our  geographical  position,   be   an\r\n\r\ninternational  shipping  interchange   or   a   world\r\n\r\ntranshipment  centre.  Shipping  systems  have   been\r\n\r\nrevolutionized  over  the last  few  years  with  the\r\n\r\nadvent of containerization. Ports can become obsolete\r\n\r\nif  they  do  not  keep up with development  in  ship\r\n\r\ndesigns.   Investment   in   containerships   exceeds\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  port facilities. With such  expensive\r\n\r\ninvestment  in ships, shipowners must maximize  usage\r\n\r\nof  the  ships through fast turn-round and high  load\r\n\r\nfactors.   Singapore  can  help  shipping   companies\r\n\r\nachieve this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall give an example of how we can become a\r\n\r\nworld  transhipment centre. The Far East/Europe trade\r\n\r\nis  characterized  by imbalance - more  cargoes  move\r\n\r\nfrom  East  to  West  than the other  way  round.  If\r\n\r\nsufficient  shipping  space  is  provided   for   the\r\n\r\nWestbound  traffic, there will naturally  be  surplus\r\n\r\nspace  Eastbound. For the Australia/Singapore  trade,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a deficiency of containerizable Southbound\r\n\r\ncargoes  to Australia. If handling costs in Singapore\r\n\r\nare  kept  low,  as they could because  of  efficient\r\n\r\noperations,  Eastbound ships in the  Far  East/Europe\r\n\r\nservice could use their surplus space to carry Europe\r\n\r\nto Australia containers for transhipment in Singapore\r\n\r\nonto  Southbound  ships  in  the  Australia/Singapore\r\n\r\nservice.   Trade  between  Mediterranean  ports   and\r\n\r\nAustralia   could   similarly   be   transhipped   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   So   too  could  cargoes   moving   from\r\n\r\nAustralia/New  Zealand  to  West  Asia.  We   should,\r\n\r\ntherefore, strive to be a world transhipment  centre\r\n\r\nand  not  just  rest  on our laurels  as  a  regional\r\n\r\nwarehousing and transhipment centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Ulu  Pandan  in  expressing our  thanks  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident for his Address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  since  taking part in democratic  elections  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  the  People's  Action  Party  scored   the\r\n\r\nhighest  number  of votes in the last elections.  The\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  have  not  only  endorsed  the\r\n\r\nmandate  of the PAP but they have also given  us  the\r\n\r\nhighest  percentage of votes since the implementation\r\n\r\nof  parliamentary  democratic system  in  1955.  This\r\n\r\nshows  that our electorate are not only aware of  the\r\n\r\nproblems ahead but they also have great confidence in\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  in view of our achievements since  we  took\r\n\r\noffice  1 7 years ago. They have expressed confidence\r\n\r\nin  the able and experienced leadership of our  Party\r\n\r\nto  ably solve problems, particularly in the wake  of\r\n\r\nslower economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the people have expressed such confidence in\r\n\r\nour  Government, we must not let them down.  We  must\r\n\r\nplan  and  tackle our national affairs carefully  and\r\n\r\nlook  after the livelihood of the people effectively.\r\n\r\nIn  the  last  17 years although our Government  have\r\n\r\ngood  performances, there have also  been  inevitable\r\n\r\nshortcomings. Therefore, I hope that in the years  to\r\n\r\ncome  we will be able to carry out our policies  with\r\n\r\ncircumspection and care before implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having read the policy speech\r\n\r\ndelivered  by  the President on 8th February  at  the\r\n\r\nopening  of  the First Session of this Parliament,  I\r\n\r\nwould  say that this is a document that sums  up  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy over the next five  years.  Such\r\n\r\nguidelines are based on the experience that  we  have\r\n\r\ngained to deal with the current situation before  us.\r\n\r\nThey  form  a  comprehensive body of policy  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Of course, there are certain portions  or\r\n\r\npoints that call for our criticism. I am sure Members\r\n\r\nwill  actively  take  part  in  the  debate  on  such\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For lack of time. I will be brief in my speech. I\r\n\r\nwish to bring up only two matters now for the special\r\n\r\nattention  of  the Government. I will  bring  up  the\r\n\r\nother   matters  from  time  to  time  at  subsequent\r\n\r\nsittings of this Parliament. The first matter I would\r\n\r\nlike  to focus attention on is the hope of our people\r\n\r\nthat  the Government will pay attention to the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  so  that  civil servants  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\ndischarge    their    duties   and   responsibilities\r\n\r\ncourteously  and  efficiently.  Civil  servants   are\r\n\r\nexpected  to  be  fair but firm in dealing  with  the\r\n\r\npublic. They should not try to pass the buck from one\r\n\r\nsection  to another, from one officer to another,  or\r\n\r\neven  from  one Ministry to another, as  this  causes\r\n\r\ngreat  inconvenience to the public. It  is  also  the\r\n\r\nhope  of  the  people  that civil  servants  who  are\r\n\r\narrogant,  highhanded and corrupted will be  severely\r\n\r\npunished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter I would like to bring up for\r\n\r\nspecial  attention  is  the  desire  of  the  general\r\n\r\nsalaried class for a proper adjustment of the  income\r\n\r\ntax  system, particularly an increase in  the  amount\r\n\r\nfor  personal reliefs. The current income tax law was\r\n\r\nimplemented as far back as 1947. It has been in force\r\n\r\nsome  30  years now, and is antiquated.  Practically,\r\n\r\nthere  has  been little or no change at all  to  this\r\n\r\nlaw. Compared to the cost of living 30 years ago, the\r\n\r\npresent  cost  of living is a far cry from  the  time\r\n\r\nwhen  this  income tax law was passed.  The  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  today has risen many times over, so  much  so\r\n\r\nthat  salaried workers find it unbearable. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  is only proper that the tax system, in particular\r\n\r\nthe personal relief for the working class, should  be\r\n\r\nadjusted accordingly as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these matters, I would say that the\r\n\r\npolicy speech delivered by the President is a correct\r\n\r\none that augurs a bright future before us. Therefore,\r\n\r\non  behalf of my electorate. I would like to  express\r\n\r\nmy  thanks  to the President and also my support  for\r\n\r\nthe policy speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I rise to support most firmly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Motion  of  Thanks moved by the Member  for  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his Address has rightly emphasised\r\n\r\nthat  the  Republic's economic and security prospects\r\n\r\nare   dependent  upon,  among  other   factors,   the\r\n\r\ndevelopments   and   changes   occurring    in    the\r\n\r\ninternational  environment.  Significant  events  are\r\n\r\ntaking  place in great power relationships and  their\r\n\r\npolicies  towards  various  states,  and  these  have\r\n\r\nprofound  implications on our national  security  and\r\n\r\neconomic development. For example, the withdrawal  of\r\n\r\nthe  United  States from the region and the  American\r\n\r\nefforts  to establish official relations with Vietnam\r\n\r\nwill  have impact on our foreign and defence policies\r\n\r\nand  on  our  economic relations  with  countries  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia. We have, therefore, to be constantly\r\n\r\naware  of  the political realities in the  world  and\r\n\r\naccordingly  respond  to them so  that  our  national\r\n\r\nsecurity  and economic development can be maintained.\r\n\r\nThe  Government,  under able and dynamic  leadership,\r\n\r\nhas  pursued imaginative policies and tough  measures\r\n\r\nwhich  have been tested and in the main proven to  be\r\n\r\nthe   most   appropriate  in  ensuring  our  national\r\n\r\nsecurity and economic growth. Such policies have been\r\n\r\nexplained in the Addenda on the various Ministries to\r\n\r\nthe President's Address. It is my contention that  it\r\n\r\nis   upon  these  policies  that  the  Republic  will\r\n\r\nprogress and prosper in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Addendum on the Ministry of\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs has clearly reiterated the sound  and\r\n\r\neffective  policy of the Government in the Republic's\r\n\r\nrelations with other countries. In our contacts  with\r\n\r\nthe  major  powers,  our policy  is  to  remain  non-involved\r\n\r\nin  their conflicts. At the same  time, we\r\n\r\nseek  to  avoid  actions which can  bring  about  the\r\n\r\ndominance  of the region by a single great power.  In\r\n\r\nthe  region,  we  seek to cooperate  with  our  ASEAN\r\n\r\nneighbours  and  to  effectively  implement  economic\r\n\r\ncooperation in accordance with the agreement  reached\r\n\r\nat  the  Bali  Summit.  I firmly  support  all  these\r\n\r\npolicies. Moreover, what strikes me as a forward  and\r\n\r\nbold  statement is the view expressed in the Addendum\r\n\r\nthat regional cooperation should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  merely  stop at ASEAN. Within the region,  there\r\n\r\nare  other  states  which are not members  of  ASEAN.\r\n\r\nDiffering  political and social systems  can  coexist\r\n\r\nand  cooperate for their mutual interests.  Presently\r\n\r\nthere  are  difficulties  between  countries  in  the\r\n\r\nregion, which must be prevented from escalating  into\r\n\r\nopen  warfare.  Some  ways  must  be  found  so  that\r\n\r\nconsultations can begin among the concerned  parties.\r\n\r\nI   hope  that  the  Government  will  endeavour   to\r\n\r\nencourage  the  other Southeast Asian governments  to\r\n\r\ncooperate  in  social  and  economic  matters  on   a\r\n\r\nbilateral basis, and possibly, hold joint discussions\r\n\r\non  issues  that  affect the peace  and  security  of\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia.  I  suggest  that  the  idea  of   a\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asian  Forum be considered  and  hopefully\r\n\r\nconvened so that all Southeast Asian governments  can\r\n\r\nnot  only discuss matters of mutual interest but also\r\n\r\nreaffirm   the   general   principles   of   peaceful\r\n\r\ncoexistence.  If mutual fears and suspicions  can  be\r\n\r\nremoved  through this exercise, then  it  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen worthwhile indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singaporeans must constantly be\r\n\r\naware  of  the  threat to our national security.  The\r\n\r\nPresident's Address mentions that the specific threat\r\n\r\nto  the  Republic  is the Communist Party  of  Malaya\r\n\r\n(CPM).  The  ultimate objective of  the  CPM  is  the\r\n\r\noverthrow of the constitutionally elected government,\r\n\r\nand  their means of achieving this are through  armed\r\n\r\nviolence,  infiltration and subversion. The  struggle\r\n\r\nagainst  the CPM and their front organizations  is  a\r\n\r\ncontinuous  one because the CPM will  never  give  up\r\n\r\ntheir  objective to overthrow the government.  Hence,\r\n\r\nall  loyal citizens must do their part to prevent the\r\n\r\ncommunists and their united front from seizing  power\r\n\r\nor subverting the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent General Elections in December 1976 have\r\n\r\nshown  that  there is overall acceptance of  national\r\n\r\nservice  and the need for everyone to be involved  in\r\n\r\nthe  defence of the country. And it is this sense  of\r\n\r\ninvolvement  that should govern our national  service\r\n\r\npolicy. In this connection. I support whole-heartedly\r\n\r\nthe  suggestion  contained in  the  Addendum  on  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  national service be extended to  women, for  a\r\n\r\nstart,  on  a  selective basis to fill up  non-combat\r\n\r\nposts.  It  is  good that our women  have  a  greater\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  play a role in the  defence  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  However,  may  I  suggest  that  two  other\r\n\r\npossibilities   be  considered  to  ensure   adequate\r\n\r\nmanpower   and   to  economise  defence  expenditure.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  is  it not possible to fill the  non-combat\r\n\r\nposts  by calling up those who have been exempted  or\r\n\r\ndeferred  on some minor medical or financial grounds?\r\n\r\nFrom  their year of exemption or deferment,  many  of\r\n\r\nthem  in these categories should have improved  their\r\n\r\nphysical and financial conditions sufficiently enough\r\n\r\nto   take   on   their  responsibility  which   their\r\n\r\ncolleagues  had shouldered earlier. Secondly,  is  it\r\n\r\nnot  possible to call up those in the volunteer force\r\n\r\nto   perform  certain  security  duties  and  thereby\r\n\r\nrelease the full-time national servicemen or regulars\r\n\r\nfor  other roles? On this point. I hope the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Defence will review the training of volunteers in\r\n\r\nthe  People's Defence Force and to expand  this  unit\r\n\r\nwhich is especially useful. For where else can adults\r\n\r\nvolunteer  for  military service in times  of  crises\r\n\r\nexcept  in  the  People's  Defence  Force?  If  these\r\n\r\nsuggestions are taken, it will be a move towards near\r\n\r\ntotal  involvement  of every man  and  woman  in  the\r\n\r\ndefence of our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, bearing in mind the uncertainties\r\n\r\nof the future, it is absolutely necessary to maintain\r\n\r\npolitical stability and guard against the forces, of\r\n\r\nviolence and chaos. It saddens me to note that  there\r\n\r\nare   some  among  us  who  are  susceptible  to  the\r\n\r\npropaganda  and  persuasion of  the  communists.  For\r\n\r\nexample, they become members of the communist  united\r\n\r\nfront   and   support  the  strategy  of  the   Euro-communists.\r\n\r\nThey are naive to believe that the  Euro-communists\r\n\r\nare different from Asian communists;  they\r\n\r\nforget  that the latter had formed united  fronts  or\r\n\r\ncoalition governments with non-communist parties  but\r\n\r\nsubsequently  when they achieved power, they  exerted\r\n\r\ntotalitarian  rule and removed all opposition.  Those\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who support\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe united front commit the highest form of treachery\r\n\r\nagainst  the  nation. It is unforgiveable  that  they\r\n\r\nshould lend support to those who seek to destroy  the\r\n\r\nvery  society that has brought benefits to them. Such\r\n\r\ndisloyal  elements  deserve  the  severest  form   of\r\n\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Ministry of Home Affairs\r\n\r\nmentions that the Ministry will continue to seek  out\r\n\r\nand  destroy communist underground organisations  and\r\n\r\nit  will neutralize those whom the communists use  as\r\n\r\nunited  front leaders. The electorate in  the  recent\r\n\r\nelections  have  voted  for  the  retention  of   the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security Act which empowers the  Government\r\n\r\nto  detain the subversive, anti-national and disloyal\r\n\r\nelements  without  going through  the  process  of  a\r\n\r\npublic  trial. Our people recognize that  such  anti-national\r\n\r\nelements are merely tools of the communists\r\n\r\nand that they are a threat to the political stability\r\n\r\nof  the country and their means of livelihood. Hence,\r\n\r\nthey  deserve to be detained. Further, I suggest that\r\n\r\nthese  anti-national elements be deprived of  certain\r\n\r\nrights  and  privileges, such as housing and  medical\r\n\r\nfacilities  which  are  enjoyed  by  our  law-abiding\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, policies in one Ministry cannot be\r\n\r\nisolated   from   policies   in   another   Ministry,\r\n\r\nespecially  when they affect national  security.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Foreign Affairs may implement  policies\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  prevent interference  in  our  internal\r\n\r\naffairs,  the  Ministry of Defence may  move  towards\r\n\r\ntotal  involvement  of  all  men  and  women  in  our\r\n\r\ndefence, and the Ministry of Home Affairs may prevent\r\n\r\ncontinuing  subversion of our youths.  Such  policies\r\n\r\nwill  achieve greater effectiveness if  our  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen are convinced of the need for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President's Address mentions\r\n\r\nthat  there are the small misguided groups  who  fall\r\n\r\nprey  to  the Marxists, Trotskyites or the New  Left.\r\n\r\nThe  Addendum  on the Prime Minister's Office  states\r\n\r\nthat the young have only faint memories of the crises\r\n\r\nand hardships of the last 20 years and this can be  a\r\n\r\nsource of weakness in terms of their ability to  meet\r\n\r\nthe challenges ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Ministry of Education mentions\r\n\r\nthat  greater  emphasis will be placed  on  bilingual\r\n\r\neducation and on technical education. I think this is\r\n\r\nvery  necessary because we need to learn the  science\r\n\r\nand  technology  of  the  West  and  to  broaden  our\r\n\r\nindustrial  base. However, in view  of  the  security\r\n\r\nthreat  and the susceptibility of our youths  to  the\r\n\r\npernicious values of the West and the persuasions  of\r\n\r\nthe  New Left, the Ministry of Education should focus\r\n\r\non  these aspects of education, namely, the education\r\n\r\nof  youths  to maintain and develop their traditional\r\n\r\nvalues  and, more important, to understand the crises\r\n\r\nand  hardships  that Singapore went  through  and  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  the security threat that faces  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThen  they  will  be better geared to counteract  the\r\n\r\nmassive and persuasive influences of the West and the\r\n\r\nNew Left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Ministry of Education states\r\n\r\nthat the aim of the subject. Education for Living, is\r\n\r\nto  inculcate social discipline and national identity\r\n\r\nand  to  imbue  in pupils moral and civic  values.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is  a commendable effort,  but  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  two modifications. Firstly, it is my  belief\r\n\r\nthat  the  target  group that needs moral  and  civic\r\n\r\neducation   is   the  secondary  and   pre-University\r\n\r\nstudents.  Presently. Education for Living  is  being\r\n\r\ntaught to children from six to eleven years, which is\r\n\r\nthe  age  group that needs it less because  they  are\r\n\r\nyoung enough to listen to and follow the instructions\r\n\r\nof  their parents and they have less opportunities to\r\n\r\nsocialise out of their school or family environments.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the  reverse in the case of the adolescents\r\n\r\nwho  are  beginning  to become independent  of  their\r\n\r\nparents and, more important, who are beginning to  be\r\n\r\nexposed to western values through the advertisements,\r\n\r\nthe  cinemas  and other information  media.  At  this\r\n\r\nstage  too,  the  values  that  were  taught  in  the\r\n\r\nEducation  for  Living lessons in the primary  school\r\n\r\ncould  well have been forgotten. Secondly,  there  is\r\n\r\npresently very little historical content in Education\r\n\r\nfor Living and children leave primary schools without\r\n\r\nany understanding of national history, especially  of\r\n\r\nthe critical periods that Singapore experienced since\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorld War II. Without such awareness, how are they to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  implications  of  certain  of  their\r\n\r\nactions or the dangers of communist infiltration  and\r\n\r\nsubversion? I suggest therefore that the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  considers the extension of  Education  for\r\n\r\nLiving   to  the  secondary  schools  and  that   the\r\n\r\nhistorical  development of Singapore, in  particular.\r\n\r\nthe  periods  of crises and hardships be included  in\r\n\r\nthe  curriculum.  Education for Living  with  History\r\n\r\nshould  be  taught  as a compulsory  subject  in  the\r\n\r\nsecondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very clear from the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Address  and  in  the  Addendum  on  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries  that Singapore  faces  uncertain\r\n\r\neconomic  and  political  conditions  ahead.  It   is\r\n\r\nevident that all Singaporeans must make the necessary\r\n\r\nsacrifices  for  the  sake  of  the  country.  It  is\r\n\r\naxiomatic,  therefore, that we are constantly  guided\r\n\r\nby  this  precept,  which has been  stressed  by  the\r\n\r\nPresident. `From each his best, to each his worth'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this Parliament is one in which the\r\n\r\nGovernment has got the highest votes and the  biggest\r\n\r\nnumber of seats ever since 1955. This has come  about\r\n\r\nbecause of the heightened political consciousness  of\r\n\r\nthe  voters  and  their trust in the  PAP.  But  this\r\n\r\noverwhelming  support does not mean  that  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  can  do  what they  like  and  implement\r\n\r\nmeasures  unilaterally without a  close  scrutiny  by\r\n\r\nParliament.  Soon after the results  of  the  general\r\n\r\nelections  were made known, the Minister  for  Health\r\n\r\nwhile  commenting on the general elections said  that\r\n\r\nthe general elections had shown that from then on the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  slightly change  its  practice  to\r\n\r\nallow  a  wider  debate  on  matters  in  the  House,\r\n\r\nparticularly  questions relating to finance  and  its\r\n\r\npolicy.  He  also  quoted  examples,  such   as   the\r\n\r\nsurcharge on PUB bills and the additional road tax on\r\n\r\nvehicles,  which  were imposed without  a  debate  in\r\n\r\nParliament. At this juncture when there is increasing\r\n\r\npolitical  awareness among the voters,  I  hope  this\r\n\r\nkind  of  incident will not happen again.  Otherwise.\r\n\r\nBackbenchers will be deprived of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity to conscientiously air the opinion of the\r\n\r\npeople in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, in his speech at the opening of this\r\n\r\nParliament, said that \"No major policy or legislation\r\n\r\nshould be passed without the closest scrutiny\".  This\r\n\r\nwould  be  the new direction for Government  practice\r\n\r\nhereafter. I hope that all Government departments  in\r\n\r\nthe  administration  of policy  will  abide  by  this\r\n\r\ndirection  and give the Backbenchers sufficient  data\r\n\r\nand  time  to study and discuss any major  policy  or\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government firmly believes in the maxim\r\n\r\n\"From   each  according  to  his  ability,  to   each\r\n\r\naccording to his performance.\" The Government  should\r\n\r\nput this maxim into practice thoroughly in the fields\r\n\r\nof   administration  and  education.  To  allow   the\r\n\r\nphenomenon   of   over-rewarding   vis-a-vis   actual\r\n\r\nperformance   to   continue  in  some   semi-official\r\n\r\norganisations, including  higher  institutions   of\r\n\r\nlearning,  is  not only a waste of public  funds  but\r\n\r\nalso,  if  not  checked  in  time, damaging  to  the\r\n\r\nreputation  of the Government. Should the  Government\r\n\r\ngive  these high-salaried perfunctory people who have\r\n\r\nmade no contribution the chance to exist, it will  be\r\n\r\na mockery to the maxim of \"From each according to his\r\n\r\nability, to each according to his performance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Addendum on the Ministry of Defence, we\r\n\r\ncome  to learn that national service will very likely\r\n\r\nbe extended to women. I believe that in a one-man-one-vote\r\n\r\nequal  society where both sexes are equal,  the\r\n\r\nwomen  also  have a similar obligation to defend  the\r\n\r\ncountry. At present, there is no lack of women in the\r\n\r\nuniformed groups in the schools. I suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Defence and the Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nshould  jointly  recruit these  women  cadets, after\r\n\r\nleaving   school,  into  national  service   or   for\r\n\r\nemployment therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Education does not seem to\r\n\r\nhave  found the correct and effective way to  realise\r\n\r\nthe  fixed  objectives. This can  be  seen  from  the\r\n\r\nunstable administration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanifested by the, constant changes in curricula  and\r\n\r\ndirectives  issued every year. Educational directives\r\n\r\nissued  in the morning are only to be changed in  the\r\n\r\nevening,  so  that  teachers  become  confused,   not\r\n\r\nknowing  what  to follow, and it is the students  who\r\n\r\nsuffer  eventually. According to a  recent  newspaper\r\n\r\nreport, there has been an increase in crime among the\r\n\r\nstudents, including girls. If the teachers have  lost\r\n\r\ntheir  heads or direction, how can we expect them  to\r\n\r\nbe  in  a  position or mood to look after  the  extra\r\n\r\ncurricular  well-being of the students?  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education will very soon be able to  come\r\n\r\nout  with  ways  and  means  to  realise  educational\r\n\r\nobjectives that have been formulated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is air pollution which is\r\n\r\nincreasing. With urban renewal and an increase in the\r\n\r\nnumber  of high-rise flats, factories everywhere  and\r\n\r\ngrowing congestion in public transport more and  more\r\n\r\nobnoxious  gases  are emitted which  are  harmful  to\r\n\r\nhealth.  In  the  city in particular, the  high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings  and flats that line the roads and  streets\r\n\r\nprevent the dispersion of obnoxious gases emitted  by\r\n\r\nbuses and other transport vehicles. If this situation\r\n\r\npersists  it  will undesirably affect the  health  of\r\n\r\nflat  dwellers  in  the  city area.  In  other  major\r\n\r\nmetropolis such as Tokyo and Los Angeles, the  danger\r\n\r\nto  human  health posed by this kind of air pollution\r\n\r\nhas  reached  disquieting proportions.  Just  as  the\r\n\r\nAddendum  on  the Ministry of Environment  concludes,\r\n\r\n\"If  air pollution is not checked early, its effects,\r\n\r\nmay   be   irreversible.\"  So  I  hope  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconcerned   will   take  early  measures   to   check\r\n\r\npollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the much treasured traditional virtues is\r\n\r\nthat  one should on all accounts live by one's hands,\r\n\r\nThe Social Welfare Department and the units in charge\r\n\r\nof  hawkers  should be reminded of this virtue.  This\r\n\r\nvirtue  should  not be damaged by their  restrictions\r\n\r\nimposed  on the over-sixties. In Singapore where  the\r\n\r\nstandard of medical services is good, the opportunity\r\n\r\nand  the  ability to make a living do not necessarily\r\n\r\nstop  at  60.  Therefore, people of 60 years  of  age\r\n\r\nshould not necessarily be prohibited from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhawking  and  encouraged to live on welfare  aid.  We\r\n\r\nshould  judge hawkers on their individual merits  and\r\n\r\nsupport  those who are able enough to be hawkers.  It\r\n\r\nhas  been reported that the Social Welfare Department\r\n\r\nis  planning to provide interest-free loans to assist\r\n\r\nthose who need help to operate small businesses. This\r\n\r\nis a good start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President pointed out in his speech that \"we\r\n\r\nshould  not seek to model our lives on Western social\r\n\r\nmores and their contemporary life-styles.\" This is  a\r\n\r\nvery   correct  and  clear  directive.  I  hope   the\r\n\r\nGovernment in every field of its administration  will\r\n\r\ntry its best to keep and maintain those good but non-Western\r\n\r\nlifestyles, and endeavour to preserve, within\r\n\r\nthe  spirit  and bounds of the law, oriental  colours\r\n\r\nthat would not obstruct our progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I stand today in this House with a very\r\n\r\nsad  heart  because at this very moment a very  close\r\n\r\ncolleague  of mine, a good teacher, a good guide,  is\r\n\r\nhaving  his last rites at the crematoria, and I  pray\r\n\r\nthat  God  will  bless the soul of  the  late  Mr  N.\r\n\r\nGovindasamy. I was with him only last Friday, talking\r\n\r\nabout  what we would speak in Parliament. He gave  me\r\n\r\nhints  on how I should address you, Sir; how I should\r\n\r\nspeak  in  this House, what possible issues we  could\r\n\r\ndiscuss; and today I have missed his company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sadder still to know, Sir, that a very close\r\n\r\nfriend  of  mine  who  was with me  in  the  People's\r\n\r\nDefence Force for over three years, Mr Lim Guan  Hoo,\r\n\r\nis  battling for his life in the hospital. The latest\r\n\r\nI  heard was that he is in a very critical condition.\r\n\r\nI  do  hope  that he is in the best of condition  and\r\n\r\nreally hope that I will have better news of him after\r\n\r\nthis Session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that I wish to associate myself with the\r\n\r\nMotion  moved  by the hon. Member for Ulu  Pandan  to\r\n\r\nthank the President for his speech. My colleagues who\r\n\r\nspoke  before  me have very aptly touched  on  nearly\r\n\r\nevery important aspect of the President's speech\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand I wish to associate myself also with their views.\r\n\r\nThe President's speech together with the addenda from\r\n\r\nthe Ministers have given all of us a succinct, frank,\r\n\r\nand  a good statement of fundamentals, policies which\r\n\r\ndecide  all  other policies upon which our Government\r\n\r\nwill decide our life, will provide the things that we\r\n\r\nthink Singapore should be given and generally to  aim\r\n\r\nfor a better life for the whole of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Addenda, it is clear that nearly every\r\n\r\nimportant  technological aspect  of  development  has\r\n\r\nbeen covered adequately. There was also emphasis that\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  role is definitely  to  serve  the\r\n\r\npeople and in the interest of the Republic. I am glad\r\n\r\nto  note that in the President's speech and also  the\r\n\r\nspeech  of  the  Prime Minister that there  was  very\r\n\r\nstrong recognition on yet another important aspect of\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   that  is,  the  human  dimensions   of\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   The   President   has   stressed   the\r\n\r\nimportance of strengthening the Asian precepts  which\r\n\r\nhave  given strength to our cultures, to make use  of\r\n\r\nit and in importing other values or technologies from\r\n\r\noverseas, we should be highly selective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Prime Minister's Office also\r\n\r\nemphasised  the need for strengthening the  character\r\n\r\nof  the  Government, the character of our  people.  I\r\n\r\nnote and I share the concern of the Member for Katong\r\n\r\nwhen  he  averred  that it is not easy  to  say  what\r\n\r\nreally are the Asian values which we need, which  are\r\n\r\nthe  more  important ones. So with  this  feeling  of\r\n\r\nsimilar doubt, I venture to cautiously suggest one or\r\n\r\ntwo  things, not that I know what Asian values  are,\r\n\r\nwhat the good ones are, but merely to bring out these\r\n\r\npoints  because  of  my  own  family  upbringing, my\r\n\r\nexperience  as a child, my experience as a schoolboy,\r\n\r\nmy experience as a youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first I have learnt is to respect the elders.\r\n\r\nEven when I was a child, I was taught what respect to\r\n\r\nelders means. Well, Sir, you will see, it is not only\r\n\r\nin  the Malay culture but also in the Chinese. Indian\r\n\r\nand other great cultures of the orient - that respect\r\n\r\nfor the elders is one of the fundamental precepts  of\r\n\r\nlife. This has become the basis of the stability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  family, of the community. And if we  are  to\r\n\r\nextend  this very concept of respect to the realm  of\r\n\r\norganisation,  we  can see how  very  applicable  the\r\n\r\nconcept  is. I have met colleagues who have  finished\r\n\r\ntheir  university education and come back  with  very\r\n\r\ngood  degrees  and they have shown themselves  to  be\r\n\r\nextremely  competent. They know the things that  they\r\n\r\nare  supposed to handle. But somehow or  other  there\r\n\r\nseems  to  be  a  very acute lack  of  this  idea  of\r\n\r\nrespect. I do not really expect our youth to  kow-tow\r\n\r\nto  everybody. But it is extremely important  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  group  activity in an organisation  that\r\n\r\nthere  must  be  some  semblance  of  recognition  of\r\n\r\nauthority, the responsibility of somebody not only to\r\n\r\ntake   charge   of  individual  persons   under   the\r\n\r\norganisation but the overall programmes which  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  done  merely by one person but together with  the\r\n\r\nmembers of the organisation in a corporate activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel the value of humility. Very often when\r\n\r\nI  meet  friends  from  the West,  they  seem  to  be\r\n\r\nskeptical when we talk about humility. They  seem  to\r\n\r\nassociate humility with weakness. On the contrary, my\r\n\r\nexperience  in  life, as I said, as a  member  in  my\r\n\r\nfamily, in school and also in the civil service where\r\n\r\nI  had the privilege of serving for 10 years, I found\r\n\r\nthat there is tremendous strength in humility because\r\n\r\nit  is through this value that you are better able to\r\n\r\nget  the  corporate action of the people who  are  in\r\n\r\nyour  organisation, people who are with you  and  who\r\n\r\nare  to  work  with  you  for the  common  objective,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  you do not show respect, if you  do  not\r\n\r\ngive  a  chance  to your colleagues to  render  their\r\n\r\nbest, then I see that all the acquired technology  of\r\n\r\neach member of the organisation will go to waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with this, I also wish to touch upon\r\n\r\na  point which was mentioned by the Member for Marine\r\n\r\nParade concerning job-hopping. It is so very easy for\r\n\r\nus  to  accuse or to blame the young for being  over-ambitious\r\n\r\nor being impatient. There are indeed  cases\r\n\r\nwhere the graduate expects so much from his first job\r\n\r\nor expects so much to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe promoted within three years to superscale grade or\r\n\r\nto  the salary bracket of the $2,000 or $3,000 range.\r\n\r\nBut this phenomenon of job-hopping, as the Member for\r\n\r\nMarine  Parade  rightly stated,  is  a  very  complex\r\n\r\nmatter.   While   there  are  instances   where   the\r\n\r\nindividual may be at fault we must never forget  that\r\n\r\na  person  leaves  a  job not merely  because  he  is\r\n\r\nlooking  for  greener pastures but he  would  have  a\r\n\r\nreason to find that the place in which he worked  was\r\n\r\na  place which did not give any meaningful service to\r\n\r\nhim,  a  place  where there is no  proper  accord  or\r\n\r\nproper respect for the views that he may hold,  or  a\r\n\r\nplace  which does not give opportunity to render  his\r\n\r\nbest  or  to  make use of his acquired expertise.  So\r\n\r\nlong  as  we ignore the deficiency in management  and\r\n\r\nkeep  on  blaming the youth for job-hopping,  then  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  we are only looking at one  side  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  job-hopping. I therefore would  like  to\r\n\r\nstress  that the problem of job-hopping is  indeed  a\r\n\r\nvery  complex  one.  While we educate,  if  necessary\r\n\r\nreprimand,  our  youth, we must also  look  into  the\r\n\r\ndeficiency  of  management, the  deficiency  in  the\r\n\r\nattitude of supervisors in how they handle the  young\r\n\r\nworkers,   and  see  whether  they  have   adequately\r\n\r\nprepared  and conditioned and helped the new  workers\r\n\r\nto    gradually   develop   loyalties   and   abiding\r\n\r\ncommitments  to the organisation to which  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also a number of issues which were\r\n\r\nmentioned in the Addendum to the President's  speech.\r\n\r\nThis  has also been mentioned by the previous speaker\r\n\r\nand  this concerns the national service for women.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  give any definite views because the  Addendum\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister  of Defence has  not  given  very\r\n\r\nadequate  arguments as to why it is now necessary  to\r\n\r\nresort to extending national service to women.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  there must be reasons and I am sure the details\r\n\r\nwill  be discussed in the debates which will be  held\r\n\r\nsubsequently. For the moment I only wish to say  that\r\n\r\nwomen have a special asset and the greatest asset  is\r\n\r\ntheir feminity. So while we do have the daily parades\r\n\r\nand weapon training, I really urge that the programme\r\n\r\nof national service for women\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be  done  to ensure that feminity  among  our\r\n\r\nwomen is not destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the community service, I have seen\r\n\r\nand  read the Addendum from the Minister for  Culture\r\n\r\nand  Science and Technology on the intention  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association  to  undertake  more   dynamic\r\n\r\ncommunity  service through its various  institutions,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the community centres. I have  for  the\r\n\r\npast  two  months been working very closely with  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres in my constituency, and I find that\r\n\r\nthere is an inadequate service which will ensure that\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  community  service  is  not   only\r\n\r\nconfined  to  the  poorer class.  From  the  way  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres have been managed, I find  that  it\r\n\r\nhas not given sufficient consideration on the need to\r\n\r\nattract,  to  call, to invite, to bring forward  more\r\n\r\nprofessional  people to participate in the  community\r\n\r\ncentres.  There  is  a large number  of  professional\r\n\r\npeople  in our country, and if the community  centres\r\n\r\ncontinue  to conduct themselves merely by relying  on\r\n\r\nthe  lower income group, or conducting its programmes\r\n\r\nand  ignoring the potential of the professionals  and\r\n\r\nthe   middle  income  group,  then  I  think  we  are\r\n\r\ndeliberately  depriving ourselves of  the  tremendous\r\n\r\nexpertise  which exists amongst our professionals.  I\r\n\r\ntherefore  urge the Minister for Culture to seriously\r\n\r\nconsider  programmes of attracting  more  integration\r\n\r\nand  greater  participation not only from  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome group but also from the professionals and  the\r\n\r\nhigher income group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Dhanabalan (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  fully support the Motion moved by the Member  for\r\n\r\nUlu  Pandan to thank the President for his speech  in\r\n\r\nwhich he outlined the policy of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has very aptly drawn attention to the\r\n\r\nspecial  responsibility  of Members  in  a  one-party\r\n\r\nParliament  which we now have by the free  choice  of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  We have been reminded that  on  matters\r\n\r\npresented  in this House we must be heard to  express\r\n\r\nthe doubts, problems and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreservations that the ordinary citizen may have about\r\n\r\nany  policy or legislation, so that during the course\r\n\r\nof  the  debate  doubts may be cleared,  reservations\r\n\r\nproperly  answered,  and genuine problems  which  may\r\n\r\nhave been overlooked by the Executive, dealt with  by\r\n\r\nsuitable amendment to the policy or legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in some ways, it is easier to field the\r\n\r\nquestions  and criticisms of an opposition  than  for\r\n\r\nMembers,  who  belong  to  the  same  party  as   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, to consider a subject before  this  House\r\n\r\nvery objectively and to identify and articulate those\r\n\r\naspects  which may be troubling the people. While  we\r\n\r\nmust  not  shirk  from  openly  supporting  unpopular\r\n\r\nmeasures that are needed, we should not consider that\r\n\r\nthere  is any special virtue in a measure because  it\r\n\r\nis  unpopular.  The Executive and the  Administration\r\n\r\nmay'  run  into  various problems in  the  course  of\r\n\r\nimplementing  a policy. It is a great  temptation  to\r\n\r\nmake things easier for themselves by proposing either\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the law or new laws when they  run  into\r\n\r\nsuch  problems. We have to be alert to any move  that\r\n\r\nwould unwittingly legalise inequities or make genuine\r\n\r\nproblems  into legal non-problems. I am quite  aware,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  fixed ideas of democratic  processes  and\r\n\r\nchecks  and  balances can paralyse the implementation\r\n\r\nof  policies which, though painful in the short  run,\r\n\r\nare  nevertheless needed in the long term  and  wider\r\n\r\ninterests  of the nation. But there is a danger  that\r\n\r\nwe  may swing to the other extreme and consider  that\r\n\r\nall  obstacles to swift and easy implementation of  a\r\n\r\npolicy as a nuisance to be got rid of by legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I am not a lawyer but I can see an example of\r\n\r\nthis  in  the  proposal to deal with the  problem  of\r\n\r\ninconsiderate  driving  by  drivers  of   buses   and\r\n\r\nlorries.  Most, if not all of us, have  been  at  one\r\n\r\ntime  or other, subjected to the intimidatory driving\r\n\r\nof  those  who handle buses and lorries  and  by  the\r\n\r\ncareless  attitude of such drivers to the  safety  of\r\n\r\nother  road  users. We agree that it  must  be  dealt\r\n\r\nwith.  But we also know of the acrobatic attempts  of\r\n\r\nthe  drivers of what is probably the smallest vehicle\r\n\r\non the road, that is, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmotor-cycle and the scooter. I am not suggesting that\r\n\r\nall  motor-cyclists  and  scooterists  are  daredevil\r\n\r\nriders.  The  majority of them probably take  to  the\r\n\r\nroad  every  day  with  great  fear  and  trepidation\r\n\r\nbecause  they know that they will come off  worse  in\r\n\r\nany  accident.  But  there is  a  significant  enough\r\n\r\nproportion  of  such riders who think that  they  are\r\n\r\nplaying a game to see who is chicken when they are on\r\n\r\nthe  road to make them quite a cause of quite  a  few\r\n\r\naccidents. This whole problem should be tackled by  a\r\n\r\ncombination  of education, more thorough  enforcement\r\n\r\nof traffic regulations, improvement of the methods of\r\n\r\ninvestigating traffic accidents and severe punishment\r\n\r\nfor  those found guilty. To put the onus of proof  on\r\n\r\nthe  driver  of  the larger vehicle to prove  himself\r\n\r\ninnocent  in  any  accident  seems  to  me  to  be  a\r\n\r\nlegislative over-kill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has also reminded us that economic\r\n\r\nprospects  in  the  next  few  years  are   full   of\r\n\r\nuncertainties and that we cannot expect the same high\r\n\r\ngrowth rate as in the past. We have to identify every\r\n\r\neconomic  activity that offers scope for  growth  and\r\n\r\nimplement  such  policies  that  will  promote   such\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging to note that the Finance Ministry\r\n\r\nis  considering changes in the tax system  that  will\r\n\r\npromote   international   trade   relating   to   the\r\n\r\nwarehousing and sale of capital goods and  equipment.\r\n\r\nWe  have  used  tax  incentives very  effectively  to\r\n\r\nchannel   investment   into  Manufacturing   and   to\r\n\r\nencourage the growth of Singapore as an international\r\n\r\nfinancial  centre  and  as a flag-of-convenience  for\r\n\r\nships.  The  use of tax incentives to strengthen  and\r\n\r\ndiversify  the traditional entrepot trade should  now\r\n\r\nreceive   attention.   Taxation   is   an   important\r\n\r\ndeterminant in the choice of a place as a  Centre  to\r\n\r\nconduct  international trade. Such trade may  or  may\r\n\r\nnot  involve  the physical movement of goods  through\r\n\r\nSingapore. In the former case the benefits  in  terms\r\n\r\nof activity in Singapore will be greater. But even in\r\n\r\nthe  latter  type of activity where Singapore  merely\r\n\r\nserves  as  a point to collate, execute and  maintain\r\n\r\nrecords of trade that does not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome through Singapore at all is still of substantial\r\n\r\nbenefit to us. We need therefore not only to maintain\r\n\r\nand   improve  the  infrastructure  to  enable   such\r\n\r\ninternational trade to be handled efficiently but  we\r\n\r\nalso need to re-examine our tax system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present income tax rates are certainly not\r\n\r\nconducive    to    attracting   those   international\r\n\r\noperations  that neither buy nor sell  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  establishment of a Fiscal Policy  Implementation\r\n\r\nCommittee to consider how best the tax system can  be\r\n\r\nadjusted  to  encourage  these  activities  is   most\r\n\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may be allowed, I would like to make a\r\n\r\nsuggestion  regarding the role in this  Committee  of\r\n\r\nthose who are directly in charge of collecting taxes.\r\n\r\nI  do  not think I am saying anything new when I  say\r\n\r\nthat tax collectors are notoriously conservative when\r\n\r\nit comes to tax incentives. Any lowering or exemption\r\n\r\nof  tax is looked upon as an immediate tax loss.  The\r\n\r\ntax  man  would rather maintain 40% tax in his  books\r\n\r\nand collect 40% of zero than lower the tax to 10% and\r\n\r\ncollect 10% of something positive. This single-minded\r\n\r\napproach is understandable and even admirable  if  we\r\n\r\nare  merely  considering the narrow aim of collecting\r\n\r\nthe  maximum tax from existing activities. But in the\r\n\r\nwider context of achieving economic growth, it  is  a\r\n\r\nhindrance. I would therefore suggest that  those  who\r\n\r\nare  directly  in  charge of tax collection  have  as\r\n\r\nlittle  to  do with the formulation of tax incentives\r\n\r\nwhose  primary purpose is not to immediately maximise\r\n\r\ntax  collections but to increase the tax base so that\r\n\r\neven with lower tax rates on specific activities more\r\n\r\ntax  can  be  collected as a whole to finance  public\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn, Sir, to the Addendum on the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development. It is heartening to\r\n\r\nnote that efforts will continue to be made to provide\r\n\r\nparks and open spaces. The many landscaped parks that\r\n\r\nare  being  provided in the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  estates and elsewhere is testimony that  those\r\n\r\nwho plan our low cost housing are keenly aware of the\r\n\r\nneed  to provide green lungs to the people living  in\r\n\r\nhigh-rise flats. Many children who live in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  high-rise flats, especially the one-room flats,\r\n\r\nneed  space where they can run or kick a ball  about.\r\n\r\nIt   would  therefore  be  most  appreciated  if,  in\r\n\r\naddition to landscaped gardens, more open fields  are\r\n\r\nprovided  within  easy access of  the  children.  The\r\n\r\nsmall  patches  of  ground, often cemented  for  easy\r\n\r\nmaintenance that we find between blocks, do  serve  a\r\n\r\npurpose  but they are not sufficient. There are  many\r\n\r\nschool  fields in the HDB estates that can  serve  as\r\n\r\nplaying fields for the children living in flats,  but\r\n\r\nI  am afraid there are always vandals and anti-social\r\n\r\nelements who cause problems when they gain access  to\r\n\r\nschool buildings and the properties within it.  If  a\r\n\r\nmethod  of  fencing-off  the school  field  from  the\r\n\r\nschool  buildings can be implemented it will  provide\r\n\r\nmuch  needed open space for children in flats to play\r\n\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of Labour, Sir, we\r\n\r\nfind  stated the paradoxical situation where we  have\r\n\r\ncitizens  registered with the Employment  Service  to\r\n\r\nsecure  employment,  while  at  the  same  time  work\r\n\r\npermits have to be issued to large numbers of foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  to work in Singapore. It is true  that  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, especially the young ones, are becoming\r\n\r\nvery  choosy  about the type of jobs  that  they  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  do.  The Ministry of Labour  should  be\r\n\r\nfully   supported  in  its  attempts   to   encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to work in those industries  which  they\r\n\r\nnow  avoid. I find that a good number of job  seekers\r\n\r\nare  those  who are past retirement age but  who  are\r\n\r\nstill  quite  healthy. They do not have any  savings,\r\n\r\nand  either  they do not have children or  they  have\r\n\r\nchildren  who  are  not able to  support  them.  Such\r\n\r\npeople   find   it   difficult  to  find   productive\r\n\r\nemployment.  This,  I  think,  is  going  to  be   an\r\n\r\nincreasing  problem  in  the  future  and  a  serious\r\n\r\nattempt  must  be  made to find a  solution.  Perhaps\r\n\r\ncertain  light jobs in the public and private sectors\r\n\r\nshould be reserved for such people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of work permits, Sir, I can see the\r\n\r\nabsolute need to control the entry of foreign workers\r\n\r\nthrough such a system. But I find it difficult to see\r\n\r\nthe  necessity to impose the requirement  of  a  work\r\n\r\npermit  on permanent residents in Singapore. Many  of\r\n\r\nthese permanent residents are not citizens of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  countries and they cannot go  off  to  another\r\n\r\ncountry. They are a part of the local population whom\r\n\r\nwe cannot wish away. It would therefore seem to be in\r\n\r\nour  interest to encourage and make it easy for  them\r\n\r\nto  earn  a  livelihood instead of being a burden  to\r\n\r\ntheir  relatives.  Although work  permits  are  quite\r\n\r\nfreely issued to permanent residents, it may take  up\r\n\r\nto  a  month to obtain a work permit. Moreover, small\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  just not prepared to go  through  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  applying  for  work  permits  for   such\r\n\r\npermanent  residents.  The  administrative  time  and\r\n\r\neffort  spent  by the Ministry of Labour  in  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  such applications can be better spent on  other\r\n\r\nmatters  if work permits for permanent residents  are\r\n\r\nwaived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it would be a good time to take\r\n\r\nthe  Suspension now.

In response to such events he went on to state\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government of Singapore will  respect  the\r\n\r\nrenewed  mandates from the people of Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nvote  of confidence in the will and determination  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government to take action, if necessary, for the\r\n\r\ncommon good. It is a correct and desirable policy  to\r\n\r\nbe  adopted by any self-respecting government. As the\r\n\r\nPresident  states, we have to formulate  our  way  of\r\n\r\nlife, taking what is best and fitting  it  into  the\r\n\r\nSingapore context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in our concern to do what is best for Singapore\r\n\r\nand  for the people of Singapore, there is always the\r\n\r\ndanger  that we may overlook the legitimate interest,\r\n\r\nwelfare  or  hope of a small section of  the  people.\r\n\r\nSuch  oversight may not be deliberately intended  but\r\n\r\nthe effect to the people concerned is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame,   regardless  of  whether  the   oversight   is\r\n\r\ndeliberate or unintended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum to the Presidential Address, it is\r\n\r\nstated that the Ministry of National Development will\r\n\r\nplan  and  work towards better housing with improved,\r\n\r\nsocial    and    recreational   facilities,    better\r\n\r\ninfrastructure and public amenities in  pleasant  and\r\n\r\ngracious  environment in the next five years.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso  stated that it is important to create new parks\r\n\r\nand  open spaces for a large number of people  living\r\n\r\nin high-rise flats. I have nothing but good to say of\r\n\r\nthe plans of the Ministry of National Development  to\r\n\r\nimprove and beautify the various housing estates  and\r\n\r\nto   expand  and  enlarge  the  various  recreational\r\n\r\nfacilities for the enjoyment of all Singaporeans. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  very  much to be  commended  for  its\r\n\r\nawareness  of  the need to improve and  beautify  the\r\n\r\nliving  conditions of a large number of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand  of  its  determination to proceed with  all  its\r\n\r\nprojects, despite the heavy costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am not sure whether the Government is fully\r\n\r\naware  of the dissatisfaction of those persons living\r\n\r\nin  the  older housing estates, such as those in  the\r\n\r\nAljunied Constituency. Their dissatisfaction is  with\r\n\r\ntheir  flats,  which are smaller and less  attractive\r\n\r\nthan  similar  types of flats in  the  newer  housing\r\n\r\nestates.   They  are  also  dissatisfied   with   the\r\n\r\nenvironment  of  their flats, because  in  the  older\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  there are hardly  any  recreational\r\n\r\nfacilities for the residents and, particularly, their\r\n\r\nchildren. It is a fact that the children have  either\r\n\r\nto  play  in  dark and dirty corridors, much  to  the\r\n\r\nirritation of the residents, or they have to play  in\r\n\r\nthe car parks and on the streets, much to the anxiety\r\n\r\nof  their  respective parents. I hope the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  look into the matter and allocate some  of  its\r\n\r\nfunds  to  improving  the living  conditions  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents in the older housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note from the Addendum that the volume of\r\n\r\nhousing  and  public  projects  would  not  only   be\r\n\r\nmaintained  but increased during the next few  years.\r\n\r\nThese  projects are to be undertaken by  the  Housing\r\n\r\nand Development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard.  Urban Redevelopment Authority and the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks Department. No one would question the necessity\r\n\r\nor  the  usefulness  of  these  various  projects  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   But   I  am  concerned   that   in   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of these various projects,  sometimes\r\n\r\nunnecessary inconvenience or sufferings are caused to\r\n\r\nthose  persons whose homes have to make way for these\r\n\r\nprojects.  Whenever  a  new  housing  estate  or  new\r\n\r\nroadway  is  planned, there are bound to  be  persons\r\n\r\nliving on the land on which the housing estate or the\r\n\r\nnew  roadway  is  to  be sited. This  is  so  because\r\n\r\nSingapore  is a compact and densely populated  island\r\n\r\nwith  hardly any undeveloped or uninhabited area.  It\r\n\r\nis the price of development and progress that must be\r\n\r\npaid.  But  my  point is whether in  planning  a  new\r\n\r\nhousing  estate or new roadway, the Government  gives\r\n\r\ndue  consideration to the consequent  change  in  the\r\n\r\ncharacter  of the neighbourhood concerned. There  are\r\n\r\nusual  grievances of projects being planned and  then\r\n\r\nscrapped,  with the result that a number  of  persons\r\n\r\nare unnecessarily evicted from their homes, sometimes\r\n\r\nyears  ahead  of  the  actual implementation  of  the\r\n\r\nproject. There is certainly cause for grievance among\r\n\r\nthose  persons  who  are chased out  of  their  homes\r\n\r\nwithout  any apparent justification. But  I  am  more\r\n\r\nconcerned  with the destruction of old  buildings  to\r\n\r\nmake way for the so-called redevelopment projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand and appreciate that the Government has\r\n\r\npreviously  taken  steps  to  preserve  buildings  of\r\n\r\nhistorical  importance or architectural significance.\r\n\r\nBut  such historic monuments are very few and, apart\r\n\r\nfrom  that,  they by themselves do not influence  the\r\n\r\ncharacter  of  the  neighbourhood.  I  have  in  mind\r\n\r\ncertain  sections of Singapore where  shop-houses  or\r\n\r\nolder   residential  houses,  each   of   which   may\r\n\r\nindividually    have   not   much    historical    or\r\n\r\narchitectural  significance, but  which  collectively\r\n\r\nhave a unique and charming character. If Singapore is\r\n\r\nto  retain  its separate identity it is important  to\r\n\r\npreserve  the  distinctive  image  of  Singapore   in\r\n\r\nrelation to the other cities of the world. Huge slabs\r\n\r\nof glass and concrete structures may be impressive to\r\n\r\nbehold  but they can be found in any other cities  of\r\n\r\nthe world. I hope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  not  too  late for  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nconsider  seriously  preserving old  buildings  which\r\n\r\nform  part  of  Singapore's past and  which  lend  to\r\n\r\nSingapore a charming and distinctive image.  If  such\r\n\r\nold,  stronger buildings can be preserved they should\r\n\r\nbe  preserved  not only for the sake of tourists  but\r\n\r\nalso for the sake of future Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the Addendum relating to the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLabour, it is stated that the Ministry will continue\r\n\r\nto  work  with the unions and employers to contribute\r\n\r\nto  economic  growth.  I have  no  doubts  about  the\r\n\r\ndetermination  or desire of the Ministry  to  promote\r\n\r\ntripartite  cooperation  on  the  basis  of  economic\r\n\r\nprosperity  for  Singapore. The  initiative  and  the\r\n\r\nleadership shown by the Ministry on industrial safety\r\n\r\nand  health and in the promotion of productivity  are\r\n\r\nample  proof  of the good intention and sincerity  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry.  Similarly, I am  convinced  that  the\r\n\r\nworkers   under   the  disciplined  and   enlightened\r\n\r\nleadership  of  the NTUC will do their  part  in  any\r\n\r\nscheme  of  tripartite cooperation  promoted  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Singapore. But I am not so  sure  that\r\n\r\nthe  employers  are  doing  their  part  to  make   a\r\n\r\ntripartite  cooperation a meaningful  and  successful\r\n\r\neffort.    No   doubt   the   employers   or    their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives at various tripartite bodies pay  lip\r\n\r\nservice to the concept of tripartite cooperation  and\r\n\r\nare  free  with  their criticism  of  the  faults  of\r\n\r\nothers, particularly workers for allegedly not  doing\r\n\r\ntheir  part in tripartite cooperation. But there  are\r\n\r\nemployers  while  not  openly criticising  tripartite\r\n\r\ncooperation, are doing their best to make  tripartite\r\n\r\ncooperation  a  farce  in  their  own  factories   or\r\n\r\noffices. In the area of industrial health and  safety\r\n\r\nwe  read  in the papers often of accidents  happening\r\n\r\nand  of workers being killed. Quite a number of these\r\n\r\naccidents  and  deaths  could  be  avoided   if   the\r\n\r\nemployers    have   implemented   the   concept    of\r\n\r\nconsultation   with  workers  concerning   industrial\r\n\r\nhealth  and  safety and take the necessary  steps  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  life of workers and  to  prevent  the\r\n\r\noccurrence  of accidents. I hope the Government  will\r\n\r\nreview   the   contributions  of  employers   towards\r\n\r\ntripartite cooperation and, if necessary, take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  action against employers who fail to  implement\r\n\r\nany  scheme  of tripartite cooperation in  their  own\r\n\r\nfactories or offices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion\r\n\r\nof  Thanks to the President for his Address, as moved\r\n\r\nby the hon. Member for Ulu Pandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the very outset the President has warned us that\r\n\r\nthe  security and economic prospects are not as  good\r\n\r\nas  those  in 1972. On the economic front, there  are\r\n\r\ntwo external factors which affect the performance  of\r\n\r\nour   economy:  first,  the  recovery  rate  of   the\r\n\r\nAmerican, Japanese and EEC economies and, second, the\r\n\r\nmagnitude and timing of the oil price increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics show that the economic recovery of these\r\n\r\nmajor  industrial  countries  are  not  as  rapid  as\r\n\r\noriginally expected. Furthermore, the recent increase\r\n\r\nof  oil price by 5 to 10% would further slow down the\r\n\r\nalready sluggish economic recovery. As a result,  our\r\n\r\nexports  to  these  countries will  decline  and  the\r\n\r\ninvestment flow from these countries into our economy\r\n\r\nwill  also slow down. With the increase in oil price,\r\n\r\nthe    cost    of    providing   public    utilities,\r\n\r\ntransportation   services   and   manufacturing    of\r\n\r\ncommodities which use oil-related products as  inputs\r\n\r\nwill  also rise. These will no doubt adversely affect\r\n\r\nthe  competitive edge of our exports  and  raise  our\r\n\r\ncost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the midst of this grim\r\n\r\nsituation,   however,  there  are   certain   hopeful\r\n\r\ndevelopments in the international scene. Firstly, the\r\n\r\nUnited  States President has announced  his  economic\r\n\r\nplan;  he  has proposed to inject US$30 billion  into\r\n\r\nthe  American  economy so as to cut the  unemployment\r\n\r\nrate  and  to stimulate economic recovery.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nthere are renewed efforts by the United Nations,  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States.  West Germany and France  to  seek  a\r\n\r\npeace  settlement in the Middle East. If  the  break-through\r\n\r\ncould be achieved this year, oil embargo  and\r\n\r\nsubstantial  oil  price increase  could  be  avoided.\r\n\r\nThirdly, with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchange  in  Japanese attitude, a  trade  war  between\r\n\r\nJapan and the EEC countries probably will be averted,\r\n\r\nat least temporarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to our region, our Government's effort\r\n\r\nin promoting greater economic cooperation among ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries  has  made further progress. Following  the\r\n\r\nvisit of our Prime Minister, bilateral tariff accords\r\n\r\nhave  been reached with the Philippines and Thailand.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly,  given the present volume  and  commodity\r\n\r\ncomposition  of  our trade with these two  countries,\r\n\r\nthe  economic  benefits will not be very substantial.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  this  is another big  step  towards  a\r\n\r\ngreater  cooperation  in the region  of  ASEAN.  This\r\n\r\nprogress,  together with the result  of  our  general\r\n\r\nelections,  would  enhance  the  confidence  of   the\r\n\r\npotential investors on the economic prospect  of  our\r\n\r\nRepublic and this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote industrial growth and to attract foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment,   apart   from   maintaining    political\r\n\r\nstability, we must also hold down cost of production.\r\n\r\nIt  is  reassuring to note from the Addendum  to  the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Address that \"we shall watch  carefully\r\n\r\nagainst too high Government charges for industry such\r\n\r\nas  for  port services and rates for electricity  and\r\n\r\nwater.\"  More important, we must be able  to  prevent\r\n\r\nexcessive  increase in labour costs  and  to  promote\r\n\r\nproductivity increase. Wage increase must be  orderly\r\n\r\nand related to increase in productivity. Though trade\r\n\r\nunion  and management have endorsed the productivity-gearing\r\n\r\nprinciple, nothing concrete  has  come  out.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many  practical problems of  implementing\r\n\r\nsuch  a  scheme, particularly in the service  sector.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this  is  the  best way  that  wages  could\r\n\r\nincrease without damaging our competitiveness in  the\r\n\r\ninternational market. As a start, a practical way is,\r\n\r\nwherever   possible  and  whenever   applicable,   to\r\n\r\nencourage adoption of productivity incentive  schemes\r\n\r\nat the plant level in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me now to turn to the\r\n\r\nsecurity problem. The communists will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinue   to  be  the  main  threat  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\ninternal  security. The Government must  continue  to\r\n\r\ncrack   down  on  communist  underground  and   front\r\n\r\norganisations. In the struggle with communists, there\r\n\r\nis  no  room for compromise. The hard-core communists\r\n\r\nmust  be  severely dealt with. However, students  and\r\n\r\nyouths  who  have  been  misled  and  misguided  into\r\n\r\nsupporting the communists should probably be  treated\r\n\r\nmore leniently. They should be given a chance to turn\r\n\r\nover a new leaf. Their involvement should be regarded\r\n\r\nas  one  aspect  of the youth problems in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAnother  aspect  is drug addiction which  is  like  a\r\n\r\ncancer  in  our  society undermining  the  will,  the\r\n\r\nmorale  and  the  working  capacity  of  the  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, Sir, youths are less satisfied with the\r\n\r\nstatus quo. They are rebellious and rather impatient.\r\n\r\nIn  a highly competitive society like ours, some  are\r\n\r\nfrustrated  in the process. This is quite inevitable.\r\n\r\nThose  who  are  weak in will power and  who  try  to\r\n\r\nescape, from reality would resort to drugs as an easy\r\n\r\nway   out.  Those  who  are  more  strong-headed  and\r\n\r\nidealistic  would  turn against  the  present  social\r\n\r\norder  and  try  to change it. Youths of  the  latter\r\n\r\ncategory are the prime target of recruitment for  the\r\n\r\ncommunists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum to the Presidential Address, it was\r\n\r\nprojected  that by 1980, there will be  some  810,000\r\n\r\npersons  or 33.8% of our population in the age  group\r\n\r\nof  15-29  years old. This is a serious  problem.  We\r\n\r\nshould   not  allow  drug  addiction  and   Communist\r\n\r\ninfiltration to spread, particularly in view  of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that we are heading for difficult times. Severe\r\n\r\npunishment  of  drug  pushers,  exposure  of   misled\r\n\r\nstudent  leaders, and rehabilitation of drug  addicts\r\n\r\nare  all  necessary  steps  to  contain  the  spread.\r\n\r\nHowever,  these alone are not enough.  They  must  be\r\n\r\nsupplemented  by coordinated efforts on other  fronts\r\n\r\nto educate the youths and their parents, to instil in\r\n\r\nthem  national values and to absorb their energy  and\r\n\r\nfree  time in some other positive fields. It  may  be\r\n\r\nnecessary, therefore to establish an organisation  to\r\n\r\ncoordinate these efforts and programmes to probe into\r\n\r\nthe youth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems and to recommend proper solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have also taken note of the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Address that the vote of  confidence  of\r\n\r\nour  people  places on all the Members of  Parliament\r\n\r\nthe duty to ensure that all shades of opinion out  in\r\n\r\nthe   constituencies   are   vigorously   voiced   in\r\n\r\nParliamentary questions and debates. Sir,  as  a  new\r\n\r\nMP,  it will be presumptuous on my part to claim that\r\n\r\nI know exactly the feelings and opinions of my people\r\n\r\nin   Leng  Kee  Constituency.  However,  through   my\r\n\r\nfrequent contacts with them during the Elections  and\r\n\r\nin  the  last  two months, I sense that  while  these\r\n\r\npeople  endorse  the  major  policies  ranging   from\r\n\r\nnational  defence to our foreign policies, and  have\r\n\r\nfull  confidence in our political leaders in charting\r\n\r\nthe  path for them into the future, many of them  are\r\n\r\nunhappy  about  certain policies which  affect  their\r\n\r\ndaily  lives  and the manner in which these  policies\r\n\r\nare  introduced and implemented. There are many  such\r\n\r\nexamples that could be raised in this Parliament. For\r\n\r\nthe  present.  I  just  want to  concentrate  on  one\r\n\r\nexample,  that  is, the PUB surcharge. Personally.  I\r\n\r\nreject the notion of providing public utilities  free\r\n\r\nor  with subsidies. However, Sir, may I submit to you\r\n\r\nthat although most of our people are more prepared to\r\n\r\naccept  the increase in electricity rates due to  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in fuel price, it is difficult to  convince\r\n\r\nthem that a surcharge, which is not part of the cost,\r\n\r\nshould be introduced in the first place. I think this\r\n\r\nParliament   should  reconsider   whether   the   PUB\r\n\r\nsurcharge should be continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ngeow Pack Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ngeow Pack Hua (Boon Lay)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I wish to congratulate you for  having\r\n\r\nbeen elected as Speaker of this House I also wish  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the Member for Ulu Pandan in his  Motion  to\r\n\r\nthank  the  President  for  his  speech  on  the  8th\r\n\r\nFebruary on behalf of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the People's Action Party once again swept all\r\n\r\nthe  seats in this House at the last elections. There\r\n\r\nis no other country in this world which has been able\r\n\r\nto win all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseats  at  one single election. Since the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore have made this great choice, it is  for  us\r\n\r\nto  prove in the next few years that we will not  let\r\n\r\nthem  down. The confidence of the people in us  gives\r\n\r\nus  an  additional burden. Therefore, I  support  the\r\n\r\nstatement from the President that no major policy  or\r\n\r\nlegislation should be passed without thorough  debate\r\n\r\nin  this House. As Backbenchers, we must also rise to\r\n\r\nspeak  the minds and the views of the people.  In  my\r\n\r\nview,   these   two   must   be   related.   Although\r\n\r\nBackbenchers have their duty to air the views of  the\r\n\r\npeople, the Ministers must also accept such airing of\r\n\r\nthe views and such views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to add my views on the maxim\r\n\r\nstated by the President: \"From each his best; To each\r\n\r\nhis worth.\" In particular, I would like to relate  my\r\n\r\nview  on the wage policy in the light of this  maxim.\r\n\r\nThe President said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`My government holds firm to this simple truth: that\r\n\r\nto  get  from  each his best, rewards and recognition\r\n\r\nmust  go  to  those  who excel in  consistently  high\r\n\r\nperformance'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  want  to  tie  this up with the  addendum  to  the\r\n\r\nPresidential Address on the Ministry of  Finance.  It\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We shall seek, through the National Wages Council,\r\n\r\nsingle annual wage increases which reward workers who\r\n\r\nproduce more:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This again is to be tied up with the addendum on  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour in similar light. It states:                          \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... that future wage increases have to be orderly and\r\n\r\nrelated  to  higher productivity and economic  growth\r\n\r\nFringe benefits which have escalated in recent  years\r\n\r\nmust  not be extended in range or quantum Those which\r\n\r\nare  bizarre  or  not conducive to economic  progress\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  be discontinued. The  National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil  will  examine  the  question  of  the   full\r\n\r\noffsetting of its wage guidelines against  all  forms\r\n\r\nof  increases of remuneration. It will also  consider\r\n\r\nwhether  employees who job-hop should be granted  the\r\n\r\nfull  wage  increase  recommended Rationalisation  of\r\n\r\nfringe  benefits  will also be  looked  into  by  the\r\n\r\nCouncil.  At  the  plant  level,  employers  will  be\r\n\r\nencouraged   to   implement  productivity   incentive\r\n\r\nschemes  to  ensure greater efforts on  the  workers'\r\n\r\npart and reward for such additional performance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although I am not from the unions,\r\n\r\nI  have been an employee for more than 10 years and I\r\n\r\nknow  the problems of the workers. So we have similar\r\n\r\nviews. All the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  we  hear the appeal to the workers  to  tighten\r\n\r\ntheir belts and there is conflict in this regard.  On\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand, the workers are condemned  for  being\r\n\r\nlazy. On the other hand, we hear people say that  our\r\n\r\nachievements have been due to the hard  work  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers, So we do not have a consistent stand on this\r\n\r\nmatter and workers are quite at a loss. There  is  no\r\n\r\ndispute  that  we  should  uphold  the  principle  of\r\n\r\nproductivity geared, with wage increase. But what  is\r\n\r\nproductivity? What are the norms of productivity? How\r\n\r\nis  productivity  to be measured? The  NWC  made  its\r\n\r\nrecommendations  last  year without  any  categorical\r\n\r\ndefinition  for \"productivity\". There is no  concrete\r\n\r\nproposal  for  implementing this principle.  We  have\r\n\r\nbeen  talking about productivity for years and  years\r\n\r\nbut  this has become a very abstract term. So  unless\r\n\r\nwe  can lay down some form of guidelines, there  will\r\n\r\nbe  abuse and the workers will suffer as a result  of\r\n\r\nthis  abuse. We therefore suggest that the NWC should\r\n\r\nreview  the  question of productivity very  carefully\r\n\r\nand   make  concrete  proposals.  I  feel  that   the\r\n\r\ndetermination  of  productivity  and  the   incentive\r\n\r\ntherefor  should not be determined by the  management\r\n\r\nalone.  Parliament  should also  debate  on  what  is\r\n\r\nproductivity  and  what kinds of rewards  are  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven to workers. It is only after a debate that  the\r\n\r\nrationalisation can be effected through the NWC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I would like to touch on fringe benefits.\r\n\r\nAgain,  there  is  a  lack of definition  of  \"fringe\r\n\r\nbenefit\" or rationalisation. Before we rationalise or\r\n\r\ndefine \"fringe benefits\", there is a possibility  for\r\n\r\nabuse or dispute. So since we want to learn from  the\r\n\r\nJapanese, we  must also emulate them  on  the  bonus\r\n\r\nsystem  because  this is a system  that  acts  as  an\r\n\r\nincentive  for the Japanese workers to  work  harder.\r\n\r\nBefore  we  have  a proper profit-sharing  system,  I\r\n\r\nthink the bonus system is a good system. It is a kind\r\n\r\nof  an  incentive scheme, particularly in the Chinese\r\n\r\nbusiness  community where wages are low.  And  it  is\r\n\r\nonly  through bonus as an incentive that productivity\r\n\r\nand performance can be improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, \"From each his best; To each his\r\n\r\nworth.\"  There is nothing wrong in this society.  The\r\n\r\nprinciple is right but there may be some problems  in\r\n\r\nits  implementation. I think the second part is  more\r\n\r\nimportant  than  the first. In the first  part  \"From\r\n\r\neach  his  best\",  it should be taken  to  mean  that\r\n\r\neverybody is given an opportunity to do his best.  In\r\n\r\nthe  second  part  \"To each his  worth\", what  is  a\r\n\r\nperson's  worth?  There should be a proper  personnel\r\n\r\nmanagement  system  in  all our  factories  or  other\r\n\r\norganisations. There should be emphasis on  incentive\r\n\r\nrather  than punishment. The trouble with the Chinese\r\n\r\nsystem which cannot be used in Singapore is that they\r\n\r\nemphasise  more  on penalty than on  incentives.  The\r\n\r\nsystem here is different. So we should encourage  our\r\n\r\nworkers to take their own initiative and reward  them\r\n\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President stated in his speech that there\r\n\r\nwill  be  slower  economic growth and  so  we  should\r\n\r\nadjust  our  spending  habits  accordingly.  In  this\r\n\r\nregard  I  think the Government should take the  lead\r\n\r\nbecause  over the past few years people have  changed\r\n\r\nin  their attitude towards spending. This is  because\r\n\r\nwe  over-emphasise the materialistic aspects  of  our\r\n\r\nliving.   For   example,  many  discharged   national\r\n\r\nservicemen  have become very choosy and  expect  more\r\n\r\nfrom  their  employment or their jobs. So  we  should\r\n\r\ninculcate   the   proper  values  in   our   national\r\n\r\nservicemen while they are in the national service. We\r\n\r\nmust  correct  their attitudes.  It  is  through  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of education through the mass media that  we\r\n\r\nwill  be able to correct this attitude. We must teach\r\n\r\nour  young people that if they spend two hours  in  a\r\n\r\ncoffee  house  they are spending more  than  a  day's\r\n\r\nwage.  So  we must teach our people to be frugal.  We\r\n\r\nmust  correct  their attitude. If we  switch  on  the\r\n\r\ntelevision, we can see lots of advertisements on  the\r\n\r\nBig  Sweep and Toto. Everybody is urged to  get  rich\r\n\r\nquick.  This  entirely runs counter to our  political\r\n\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another more serious problem. Sir, and\r\n\r\nthat  is the problem of communist threat in the years\r\n\r\nto  come.  Such a threat, no matter whether it  comes\r\n\r\nfrom the Malayan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party  or the Euro-New Left, there  is  a\r\n\r\nthreat,  We  are  exposed and  susceptible  to  their\r\n\r\nsubversion.  People here know what is bad  about  the\r\n\r\ncommunists  but  they may not realise  what  kind  of\r\n\r\nthreat  is coming from Europe, particularly the  non-English\r\n\r\neducated. In other words, they may not  know\r\n\r\nthe true meaning of the threat from this source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to implement the Internal Security\r\n\r\nAct  on which the Government is supported in the last\r\n\r\nelection. But the ISA alone will not be able to  wipe\r\n\r\nout  the communist threat. So we must expose the true\r\n\r\nnature  of the communists by educating our people  in\r\n\r\nunderstanding the kind of life the people are leading\r\n\r\nin  a  communist society. It is only when  they  know\r\n\r\nwhat  kind  of  life they will have  in  a  communist\r\n\r\nsociety  that  they  will  be  able  to  combat   the\r\n\r\ncommunist  philosophy or ideology. We  must  do  more\r\n\r\nthrough  the  mass media by exposing  what  communism\r\n\r\nreally is so that our young people will know the real\r\n\r\nthreat of communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of Education we are\r\n\r\ntold  that the emphasis henceforth will be  on  moral\r\n\r\nvalues and moral education. So we must do all we  can\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that our students are imbued  with  Asian\r\n\r\nmoral  values so that they will not be influenced  by\r\n\r\ncontemporary Western life styles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of Culture, it is\r\n\r\nstated  that  we must make every effort  possible  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  there is no erosion of our  traditional\r\n\r\ncultural values. There is no doubt that we should  do\r\n\r\nthese  things. We must also educate our young  people\r\n\r\nnot  to accept ideologies which are irrelevant to our\r\n\r\nsociety.  We  must also inculcate  in  our  youth  an\r\n\r\nidealism  that they will not allow themselves  to  be\r\n\r\nused  or  manipulated  by the  communists.  Both  are\r\n\r\nequally  important. We must have  the  proper  spirit\r\n\r\ncoupled  with  good moral values. We  must  give  our\r\n\r\nyoung people a proper understanding of these values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek Bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek Bin Saniff (Kolam Ayer)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I rise to support the Motion  thanking\r\n\r\nthe   President  for  his  speech  delivered  on  8th\r\n\r\nFebruary   1977.  In  the  midst  of  world  economic\r\n\r\nuncertainty  and  anxiety  and  with  the   increased\r\n\r\nresponsibilities    of    Ministers    and    greater\r\n\r\nexpectations from Members of Parliament,  two  things\r\n\r\nhave  been  stressed for all of us  to  think  about.\r\n\r\nFirst,  vigilance against undemocratic elements  like\r\n\r\nthe  CPM. Second, moral values and attitudes  towards\r\n\r\nlife  that  must  be  inculcated  in  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. There are, I note, 41 lines in respect  of\r\n\r\nthe first and 66 lines in respect of the second. Both\r\n\r\ntopics  occupy  greater space when  compared  to  the\r\n\r\nothers,   and  this  in  itself  shows  their   great\r\n\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 23rd December 1976, the people of Singapore made a decision that can be taken to mean that\r\n\r\npolitics  is a serious business and that it  requires\r\n\r\npeople who are equally serious to manage it. Politics\r\n\r\nis not a game, neither is it a gambling den. The most\r\n\r\na  gambler can lose is his money, property or honour.\r\n\r\nBut  gambling  with  politics  brings  about  a  more\r\n\r\nterrible  consequence. Mistakes can cause destruction\r\n\r\nto property, destruction to family and destruction to\r\n\r\ndemocracy, self and nation. We do not have to go  far\r\n\r\nfor  an  example. Miscalculations whereby the \"weapon\r\n\r\nwill  injure the master\" as happened in Indonesia  to\r\n\r\nthe  PKI  and the victories in East of Thailand  have\r\n\r\nbrought  the  lesson  home:  that  infiltration   and\r\n\r\ninvasion or armed struggle are double edged.  We  can\r\n\r\ndraw  a lesson from this, Their victories have caused\r\n\r\nan  increase in infiltration, and this means that  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary for us to be vigilant. In this  respect\r\n\r\nwe welcome the steps taken by the Ministry of Defence\r\n\r\nand the Ministry of Home Affairs to make Singapore  a\r\n\r\nsafe place to live in, something that is easy to come\r\n\r\nby these days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people have given us their\r\n\r\nmandate in 1976 with set programmes as found  in  the\r\n\r\nAddenda  to  the  President's Address  which  include\r\n\r\nproblems and steps to be taken in health and economic\r\n\r\nsectors,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsocial and medical services, education and defence. I\r\n\r\nfeel the same mandate will be given in 1981. The only\r\n\r\ndifference  is that in that time our voters  will  be\r\n\r\nmore  sophisticated. They will judge us on the  party\r\n\r\nwe join and also the candidate's credibility. This is\r\n\r\nan indication that will be an important factor two or\r\n\r\nthree  years after 1981, or we can even  say  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  years before the 1 986 general elections.  Our\r\n\r\npolitical  chessboard will be more  interesting.  And\r\n\r\nthe  CPM  and its allies will probably lay stress  on\r\n\r\nthese  two  matters - (1) the absence of the  present\r\n\r\nleaders;  (2)  the  way we go about implementing  our\r\n\r\nprogramme. With regard to the first, the knowledge of\r\n\r\nthe  absence  of  all  or some of  our  leaders  will\r\n\r\nencourage them to prepare for 1984, a very busy  year\r\n\r\nfor   their   activities.  But  our  dedication   and\r\n\r\nsincerity will frustrate them. We can also  have  the\r\n\r\nsituation  under  control if we can  look  after  our\r\n\r\nsecond  programme well, i.e, our approach in carrying\r\n\r\nout our tasks This will be a strengthening pillar for\r\n\r\nour  people. It is not easy for someone in  power  to\r\n\r\navoid feeling arrogant and proud. We must avoid these\r\n\r\npitfalls, because  if  we  allow  this  to   happen\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a whole will go down the  pit.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthis  is  an  important criterion for all  of  us  to\r\n\r\nobserve.  It is a time bomb of self-destruction  that\r\n\r\nis  set to explode. A worthwhile programme should not\r\n\r\nbe  carried  Out in a way that would cause uneasiness\r\n\r\namong  the  people.  If this happens  the  worthwhile\r\n\r\nprogramme will no longer have any meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, 72.4% of the people of Singapore at\r\n\r\nleast  agree that nothing in this world is for  free.\r\n\r\nincluding  air and water. Air and water  have  to  be\r\n\r\ntreated for use. Nobody now wants to drink free rain-water\r\n\r\nthat comes direct from the sky. Nobody wants to\r\n\r\nkeep  quiet when the air around him is polluted.  The\r\n\r\npeople are prepared to pay they appreciate this value\r\n\r\nin  life. In this regard we must see that the  people\r\n\r\ndo  not feel that we are a profit-orientated society.\r\n\r\nIf  it  has  to  be, let the profit be very  minimal,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in sectors where we do  not  subsidise.\r\n\r\nLet not the people feel that they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  subsidising  the Government. I  agree  with  the\r\n\r\nprevious  speaker  who asked if it was  necessary  to\r\n\r\nlevy a PUB surcharge of 5%. We can be proud with  the\r\n\r\nprofits we get or make, but not profits we make  from\r\n\r\nthe  people.  There is nothing to be  proud  of,  and\r\n\r\nprofit in this regard is meaningless. The actual word\r\n\r\nis neither proud nor profit. It is \"support\". We need\r\n\r\nthe  people's support and support must come with open\r\n\r\nheart.  I  am  sure the people are prepared  to  give\r\n\r\ntheir  support and if necessary, their  sacrifice  if\r\n\r\nthe  nation  requires it. Again, in this  matter  the\r\n\r\napproach  in  carrying out our policies  through  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  machinery must be looked  after  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  not only support us but are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nsacrifice their life and property if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in this respect, I feel that in order to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  our people from undesirable  elements,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  better if the Ministry of Education  could\r\n\r\nreview the importance of kindergartens by placing  it\r\n\r\nunder  its wing. I feel that at one time kindergarten\r\n\r\nclasses  were  held in order to protect our  children\r\n\r\nfrom  adverse influence. Now, after 17 years  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat we should look into their standards and quality.\r\n\r\nIf  we can bring these kindergarten classes under the\r\n\r\nwing  of  the Ministry of Education, it will  improve\r\n\r\nthe   method  of  instruction, especially   we   can\r\n\r\ninculcate  good  values, followed  by  Education  for\r\n\r\nLiving  in  the primary schools and Civics when  they\r\n\r\nreach secondary schools. In this way I feel we have a\r\n\r\nbetter  foundation, we can keep undesirable  elements\r\n\r\nand  exploitation under check for  the  sake  of  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel there should be a total review of policy\r\n\r\non   citizenship.   We   should   consider   granting\r\n\r\ncitizenship  to  those  who have  been  holding  blue\r\n\r\nidentity cards for more than ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if infiltration can be controlled and\r\n\r\ngood  programmes and right approach can be  given  to\r\n\r\nour  people. I see no reason why Singapore should not\r\n\r\nprogress further and achieve prosperity and order  at\r\n\r\nall times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nPresidential Address is a sober review of past events\r\n\r\nand future prospects of Singapore. In brief, there is\r\n\r\nno  easy  short-cut  to  prosperity  at  least  where\r\n\r\nSingapore is concerned. The message is clear  -  that\r\n\r\nall  Singporeans  are  expected  to  do  their  share\r\n\r\ntowards  making  Singapore a viable, independent  and\r\n\r\nsovereign  Republic.  But I am  afraid  that  such  a\r\n\r\nmessage   is   likely   to   become   distorted    or\r\n\r\nmisinterpreted by persons because of their own  self-interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Prime Minister's Office it\r\n\r\nis  stated  that the average earnings  of  the  modal\r\n\r\ngroup  of  workers have trebled since 1965  and  that\r\n\r\nthose  who  have achieved more and earned  more  have\r\n\r\ndone  so  because  they have worked harder  or  shown\r\n\r\ngreater enterprise. The statement I have just  quoted\r\n\r\nis  correct  and  is  in itself a  testimony  to  the\r\n\r\nexcellent  performance and the creditable  leadership\r\n\r\nof  our  Government. But such a statement is  a  bald\r\n\r\nstatement    of    fact   which,    without    proper\r\n\r\nqualification, may lend itself to misquotation out of\r\n\r\ncontext.  While  the average earnings  of  the  modal\r\n\r\ngroup of workers have undoubtedly trebled since 1 965\r\n\r\nthe increase in earnings has to a considerable extent\r\n\r\nbeen  offset by a corresponding increase in the  cost\r\n\r\nof  living  since 1965. This is in no  way  meant  to\r\n\r\ndetract  from  the achievements of the Government  in\r\n\r\nsecuring such a great increase in the earnings of the\r\n\r\nworkers  but  the danger is that some  employers  may\r\n\r\npounce  upon such statement with cynical delight  and\r\n\r\nuse  it  to irritate and provoke workers who are  too\r\n\r\naware of the increased cost of living since 1965.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the character of our pragmatic society\r\n\r\nis  reflected  in the statement that those  who  work\r\n\r\nharder or who show greater enterprise are entitled to\r\n\r\na  greater slice of the cake than those who  are  not\r\n\r\nprepared   to   work   hard  or  as   enterprisingly.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, any statement to this effect has  to  be\r\n\r\nproperly  qualified or else it is just likely  to  be\r\n\r\nmisquoted  out  of  context. It is generally  assumed\r\n\r\nthat employers and other decision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmakers,  because  of  the  greater  and  more  taxing\r\n\r\nresponsibility and duty, have to work for their perks\r\n\r\nand other privileges that go with their positions. As\r\n\r\na result of this assumption it has become fashionable\r\n\r\nin certain circles in Singapore to blame entirely the\r\n\r\nworkers  for  any  low productivity  in  industry  or\r\n\r\nestablishment. Unfortunately, it is easy to spotlight\r\n\r\nor   pinpoint   the  incompetent  or   unsatisfactory\r\n\r\nperformance of workers. On the other hand, it is  not\r\n\r\neasy to prove or show up the inefficiency or the lack\r\n\r\nof  initiative  on  the  part of  management.  If  an\r\n\r\nindustry or establishment is not as productive as  it\r\n\r\nshould be, it may be due to the workers or it may  as\r\n\r\nwell be due to the failure of employers or management\r\n\r\nto  provide  suitable machinery or  equipment  or  to\r\n\r\ndevise  an  effective system of  work  and  congenial\r\n\r\nworking conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of productivity has many aspects and\r\n\r\nramifications  but  emphasis in Singapore  is  wholly\r\n\r\nfocussed on the alleged or proven failure of workers.\r\n\r\nThis, in my view, is a rather distorted perception of\r\n\r\nthe problem of productivity. In support of my view  I\r\n\r\ncall the attention of this House to a recent story in\r\n\r\nthe local press of certain articles of clothing being\r\n\r\nmanufactured in and exported from Singapore and  then\r\n\r\nimported  back into Singapore and sold  at  three  or\r\n\r\nfour  times the factory price. It is less painful  to\r\n\r\nascribe  the  existence  of such  a  situation  to  a\r\n\r\npreference of Singaporeans for foreign products.  But\r\n\r\nI  think  this is an oversimplified explanation.  The\r\n\r\nreason  why  Singaporeans, and for  that  matter  all\r\n\r\nother  persons, buy jeans supposedly made in USA, is\r\n\r\nnot  because  they are made in USA but because  these\r\n\r\njeans   are  marketed  with  a  continuously  massive\r\n\r\nadvertisement campaign in all media. I do  not  think\r\n\r\nthe Singapore manufacturers of jeans are prepared  to\r\n\r\nfork  out  a  big  outlay  in a  similar  advertising\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  create  a  brand  name  preference  and\r\n\r\nfollowing for their own products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather strange that we are prepared to view\r\n\r\nin   a   charitable  light  the  failure   of   local\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   employers  to  show   the   kind   of\r\n\r\nenterprise and initiative shown by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanufacturing employers in other parts of the  world,\r\n\r\nlike  for  instance, Japan. It was not too  long  ago\r\n\r\nthat  I read in a magazine an account of the reaction\r\n\r\nof  British workers to the Japanese management  of  a\r\n\r\nJapanese  industry in England. Now British  employers\r\n\r\nhave become synonymous with low productivity. Yet the\r\n\r\nproductivity of British workers in Japanese firms  in\r\n\r\nBritain  is  of such a level as to even  satisfy  the\r\n\r\nexacting requirements of the Japanese management.  It\r\n\r\nappears  that  one of the reasons for  such  sterling\r\n\r\nperformance by British workers is that they have been\r\n\r\ngreatly  impressed  by the example  of  the  Japanese\r\n\r\nmanagement.  For  one  thing. Japanese  managers  and\r\n\r\nexecutives do not indulge in lunch hours of  two-hour\r\n\r\nduration  as their British counterparts are  wont  to\r\n\r\ndo.  Whatever  perks and privileges  enjoyed  by  the\r\n\r\nJapanese managers and executives are enjoyed  outside\r\n\r\ntheir  working  hours which are  not  less  than  the\r\n\r\nworking hours of the ordinary workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I find\r\n\r\nit  hard  to  understand the fashionable  posture  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  ascribe to the workers  anything  that\r\n\r\ngoes  wrong  on  the industrial scene  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThus, in the Addendum on the Ministry of Labour it is\r\n\r\nstated that the National Wages Council is to consider\r\n\r\nwhether  job-hopping employees should be granted  the\r\n\r\nfull  wage  increase recommended by the  NWC.  It  is\r\n\r\nimplicit  in such a statement that job-hopping  is  a\r\n\r\nsocially  undesirable practice and  that  job-hopping\r\n\r\nemployees  are wholly to be blamed. With due  respect\r\n\r\nto  the  Ministry of Labour. I think it is unfair  to\r\n\r\nblame employees for being wholly responsible for  the\r\n\r\npractice  of job-hopping. Just as it takes two  hands\r\n\r\nto clap, it also requires two parties to give rise to\r\n\r\nthe practice of job-hopping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, there are workers who, as stated in\r\n\r\nthe  Addendum  on the Prime Minister's  Office,  have\r\n\r\nhigh  expectations, the  desire  to  seek  jobs   in\r\n\r\ncomfortable surroundings or who are even impatient to\r\n\r\nsucceed  financially. On the other  hand,  there  are\r\n\r\nemployers  who have not the faintest idea  of  career\r\n\r\ndevelopment for their employees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  who  have no desire to accord to their employees\r\n\r\neven  the  minimum statutory rights.  Such  employers\r\n\r\nhave  no scruples in dismissing their employees under\r\n\r\nthe pretext of reorganisation in order to prevent the\r\n\r\nemployees from being unionised. Similarly, it is  not\r\n\r\nan  uncommon  practice for employers to  get  rid  of\r\n\r\ntheir  employees  who are on top of their  respective\r\n\r\nscales   under  the  pretext  of  reorganisation   or\r\n\r\nredundancy.  To  my mind, it seems most  unfair  that\r\n\r\nsuch  dismissed or retrenched workers who  have  been\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  the opportunity to forge a career  with\r\n\r\nthe  former employers are now to be deprived of their\r\n\r\nNWC increments from the new employer simply by reason\r\n\r\nof  a  change of employment, I hope that the Ministry\r\n\r\nand the NWC will seriously and carefully consider all\r\n\r\nthe  various ramifications and aspects of the problem\r\n\r\nof  job-hopping before implementing any  decision  on\r\n\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teo, you have about four minutes to make\r\n\r\nyour speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I would like to join hon.

Likewise, the civil servants in all  the\r\n\r\nministries  should  enhance  the  quality  of   their\r\n\r\nservice. Hard work, honesty, courtesy and helpfulness\r\n\r\nare   the   vital   ingredients  in  fulfilling   the\r\n\r\nobjectives  of efficiency in dedicating their  public\r\n\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of Home Affairs,\r\n\r\nthe  President stated that drug abusers  and  addicts\r\n\r\nmust  be  flushed out and isolated for a sufficiently\r\n\r\nlong period to prevent them from infecting others. It\r\n\r\nis  most  alarming  to know that the  habit  of  drug\r\n\r\nconsumption  by youths in Singapore will continue  to\r\n\r\ngrow  and infect many other innocent people. Sir,  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  tough measures taken by the Government  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  and  wipe  out  drug  trafficking  and  drug\r\n\r\npushing,  the traffickers and pushers are not  taking\r\n\r\nthe  law  seriously.  They are  still  doing  a  very\r\n\r\nprofitable business. These\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunlawful  activities are causing a major  problem  to\r\n\r\nour  effort  in  nation-building. The  situation  has\r\n\r\ndeteriorated   tremendously  that  the   evil   drug-traffickers\r\n\r\nare even tarnishing the good name of  our\r\n\r\nRepublic   by  taking  advantage  of  our   strategic\r\n\r\ngeographical  position to distribute  drugs  to  many\r\n\r\nother European countries. We must find ways and means\r\n\r\nto  deal with this serious problem. Surveillance work\r\n\r\nwill  need to be undertaken to keep an ever  watchful\r\n\r\neye on suspect drug traffickers with the objective of\r\n\r\nultimately  arresting and prosecuting them.  I  fully\r\n\r\nsupport  the Government in making use of the  Police.\r\n\r\nSpecial  Constabulary and Vigilante Corps extensively\r\n\r\nto   help   deal   with  the  growing  menace   which\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  requires the public's full  support  and\r\n\r\ninformation. The public must be effectively urged and\r\n\r\nencouraged through the mass media and the cinemas  to\r\n\r\nbe  vigilant  and give their fullest  cooperation  in\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teo, it is 6.00 o'clock now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn\" - [Mr E.
