First,  will  the Minister consider  issuing\r\n\r\npublic  bonds by tile S.T.B, to meet part  of  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  cost? Second, will the  Minister  let\r\n\r\nthe  I-louse know whether tile new rates are final\r\n\r\nand   that  there  are  no  grounds  for   further\r\n\r\nnegotiation, or   will   he   consult   business\r\n\r\norganisations   before  finalising   tile   rates?\r\n\r\nLastly, has  his Ministry done any evaluation  on\r\n\r\nthe new rates and, if so, how do they compare with\r\n\r\nthe  charges  under  the Message  late  system  as\r\n\r\npractised, say, in a country like Malaysia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will\r\n\r\nattempt   to  reply  to  the  three  supplementary\r\n\r\nquestions.  First,  whether  there  will  be  more\r\n\r\npublic telephones to be installed. We already have\r\n\r\nno  less than 2,000 public telephones at ten cents\r\n\r\nper call, and we have another\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2,000 in hand which will he made available to  the\r\n\r\npublic  soon, and we intend to increase the  number\r\n\r\nof public telephones in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second supplementary question.\r\n\r\nwhether the increased rentals with effect from 1st\r\n\r\nOctober,  1971 will be final. The answer  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  final  and  there will  be  no  further\r\n\r\nnegotiation or discussions with interested groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly whether evaluation has been made on the\r\n\r\nproposed   increased  rentals  with  effect   from\r\n\r\nOctober  of  this  year, I can say  that  the  new\r\n\r\ntelephone   rentals,  even  with  the   prevailing\r\n\r\nGovernment  tax  of  15  per  cent, will  compare\r\n\r\nfavourably  with telephone rentals now charged  in\r\n\r\nWest  Malaysia.  We have not made any  attempt  to\r\n\r\nfind  out what goes on in East Malaysia because  a\r\n\r\nsea   of   about  800  miles  separates  the   two\r\n\r\ncountries. So I think we can only talk about  West\r\n\r\nMalaysia  where  it is possible  for  us  to  have\r\n\r\nsubscriber  direct dialling service  available  to\r\n\r\nthose  in  Singapore. As regards charges  in  West\r\n\r\nMalaysia subscribers do pay annual rentals of $204\r\n\r\nfor  a  residential  telephone  and  $360  for   a\r\n\r\nbusiness telephone. They also pay, in addition,  a\r\n\r\nsurcharge of ten cents a call after the first  one\r\n\r\nhundred     calls.    Furthermore,     residential\r\n\r\nsubscribers are also required to deposit $75 while\r\n\r\nthe  deposit  required for a  business  subscriber\r\n\r\nranges from $200 to $500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> I am satisfied with the\r\n\r\nanswers  to  the  last  two  questions.

[Laughter] I simply wish to  continue\r\n\r\nwith the speech I made last week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Nixon's move as announced on the 16th\r\n\r\nof  July will, I think, lead to the establishment\r\n\r\nof  relations  with  the  People's,  Republic  of\r\n\r\nChina.    This    development   is    historically\r\n\r\ninevitable.  The  United  States  can  no  longer\r\n\r\nignore  the  political and  legal  existence,  of\r\n\r\nChina,  just as China `has to recognise that  she\r\n\r\nis  living  in  a big world with two super-powers\r\n\r\nand  other  big powers. And although  the  latest\r\n\r\nAmerican  move has partly to do with the American\r\n\r\nposition  in  relation to the war in Vietnam, it\r\n\r\nhas  in  fact taken place because the policy  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  formulated for  itself  vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nChina  22 years ago is becoming less relevant  as\r\n\r\nthe world has changed much since then. It was the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  which formulated this  policy  of\r\n\r\nrecognising  the Republic of China  under  Chiang\r\n\r\nKai  Shek  and it is the United States which  now\r\n\r\nwants to undo this policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 20 years ago America was the victor in\r\n\r\nthe war and she was then the only super-power  in\r\n\r\nthe world. And she considered the Soviet Union as\r\n\r\nher  No.  1  enemy.  The United  States  believed\r\n\r\nherself to be lighting the Soviet Union in China.\r\n\r\nKorea, Vietnam and elsewhere. But over the years.\r\n\r\nthe United States has realised, albeit belatedly,\r\n\r\nthat what, ever policy China is conducting is  on\r\n\r\nher own behalf and for her own interest. This has\r\n\r\nbecome  all  the more evident to her since  China\r\n\r\nbreached  with the Soviet Union, it would  appear\r\n\r\nthat  the  United  States is  moving  towards  an\r\n\r\naccommodation  with  China  as  an   increasingly\r\n\r\nstrong  independent power, just as she  has  been\r\n\r\nseeking accommodation \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the Soviet Union to reduce conflicts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For China, her policies are also changing. The\r\n\r\nUnited States is no longer regarded as the No.  1\r\n\r\nenemy in interstate relations, although what  she\r\n\r\ncalls  \"American  imperialism\"  might  still   be\r\n\r\nconsidered  its  ideological adversary.  This  is\r\n\r\nindicated clearly in speeches and broadcasts made\r\n\r\nby the leaders of the People's Republic of China.\r\n\r\nDuring  the  last  five to six  years  China  has\r\n\r\nbecome  a  nuclear power. This  is  an  important\r\n\r\nfactor  to  consider  as China  cannot  from  now\r\n\r\nonwards conduct diplomacy like when she was  just\r\n\r\na  military power. From now China has to  conduct\r\n\r\npower   politics  by  the  normal,  international\r\n\r\nchannels and the best way for her to do  this  is\r\n\r\nto join the United Nations. To this extent, China\r\n\r\ncould  be'  considered sincere in her  desire  to\r\n\r\njoin the. U.N, a:; she gradually picks up the old\r\n\r\nLeninist  slogan  of  peaceful  co-existence  and\r\n\r\npeaceful   competition   between   states    with\r\n\r\ndifferent social systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China's entry into the United Nations is\r\n\r\ninevitable. China is a big power, as said on 30th\r\n\r\nJuly,   1971, and  Singapore  cannot   influence\r\n\r\ninternational events. There will be no change  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's attitude towards what is  called  the\r\n\r\n\"important question\" issue on the entry of  China\r\n\r\nin  the  United  Nations.  Singapore  has  always\r\n\r\nsupported  China's  entry  into  the   U.N.'   WQ\r\n\r\nabstained  on the Albanian resolution  previously\r\n\r\nbecause the first part of that resolution, in our\r\n\r\nview,  needed  to  be decided  first  before  the\r\n\r\nsecond  part  could be decided upon.  We  believe\r\n\r\nthat  once  China is admitted, the  possibilities\r\n\r\nare that she will take her seat and automatically\r\n\r\nbecome a member of the Security Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's attitude is that as a small power\r\n\r\nour  policy is to adjust to big realities created\r\n\r\nby  the big powers. Singapore does not want to be\r\n\r\nunder  the influence of one power. There are,  in\r\n\r\nany  case,  many powers around us which  want  to\r\n\r\npursue  their  economic and other interests.  The\r\n\r\ncompetition amongst the big powers is for markets\r\n\r\nand   security'  interests  which  are  in   fact\r\n\r\nlegitimate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobjectives to pursue. Essentially, the competition\r\n\r\nis  of  an  economic  nature,  Most  countries  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast   Asia   are  interested   in   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  and  one more power, in  this  case\r\n\r\nChina, which could help in this field,  would  be\r\n\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic competition in Southeast Asia is\r\n\r\nmade  all the more complex by two factors, namely.\r\n\r\nChina  coming  in  with a market  of  700  million\r\n\r\npeople  will increase the competition  with  other\r\n\r\nbig powers. This naturally will increase attention\r\n\r\nby  the  United  States to her economic  interests\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Vietnam  war is over. Therefore,  there\r\n\r\nwill  then be a new situation with new vistas  for\r\n\r\nall  to  watch and make the necessary adjustments.\r\n\r\nIt  would  in  our opinion, be as  if  a  new  and\r\n\r\npowerful neighbour has come to do business in  the\r\n\r\nold neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I support the motion expressing  our\r\n\r\nthanks  to  the President's speech. The  President\r\n\r\nmade a policy speech in this House on the 21st  of\r\n\r\nlast  month and this has added a new page  in  our\r\n\r\nnation-building history. In his policy speech, the\r\n\r\nPresident has painted a beautiful picture  of  our\r\n\r\nachievements.  He  has  also  laid  down   correct\r\n\r\ndirectives in regard to our future task of nation-building.   He  has  also  laid  stress   on   the\r\n\r\nimportance of strengthening our defence capability\r\n\r\nin  order  to  ensure our security and  stability.\r\n\r\nUndeniably,  this is what we should do  to  ensure\r\n\r\nour  independence and sovereignty. When we  gained\r\n\r\nour  independences, some six years ago. I remember\r\n\r\nthere  were people who expressed doubts about  our\r\n\r\nability  to maintain our security and sovereignty.\r\n\r\nHowever, after these six years of independence, we\r\n\r\nhave   achieved  great  progress  in  our  defence\r\n\r\ncapability.  This is due to the concerted  efforts\r\n\r\nof our people in co-operating with the Government.\r\n\r\nAs the President has pointed out in his speech, we\r\n\r\nmust  be  viable  in  our  defence.  Through   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-Power  defence  arrangements,  security   and\r\n\r\nstability are assured for several, years ahead. We\r\n\r\nmust  make  use  of this time to  consolidate  our\r\n\r\ndefence  capability. It is true that in this  task\r\n\r\nwe   should  exert  great  efforts.  Our  national\r\n\r\nservice   youths   have  put   up   an   excellent\r\n\r\nperformance  in  our  National  Day  celebrations.\r\n\r\nEveryone of them is well-disciplined. Therefore, I\r\n\r\nbelieve our youth will be able to take up the task\r\n\r\nof defending our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the defence of our country, the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of stability and the' development  of\r\n\r\nour  economy  is also very important.  Only  in  a\r\n\r\nstable  environment can we have  more  investment,\r\n\r\nthereby creating more opportunities `if employment\r\n\r\nand raising the standard of living of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the President's policy speech, mention\r\n\r\nhas been made of higher rates, of compensation for\r\n\r\nthose people affected by resettlement. This  is  a\r\n\r\nvery   correct   measure.   We   know   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's urban renewal scheme is in the  long-term  interest of our country. Therefore, it needs\r\n\r\nthe  full support of all the people. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  we must also give sympathetic consideration\r\n\r\nto  people  affected by resettlement so that  they\r\n\r\nmay not suffer any great loss. So the Government's\r\n\r\ndecision to increase the rates of compensation and\r\n\r\nex gratia payments is a measure that we all should\r\n\r\npraise and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now go through the various topics in the\r\n\r\naddendum  to  the President's speech. Mention  has\r\n\r\nbeen  made  of  the allocation of $5  million  to\r\n\r\nresettle  the  hawkers  in various  parts  of  the\r\n\r\nisland.  The plan involves the building of  market\r\n\r\ncentres  to  accommodate  the  hawkers.  This   is\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  a good plan because it  will  provide\r\n\r\nfixed  localities  for  them  to  carry  on  their\r\n\r\nbusiness, and also to enable members of the public\r\n\r\nto   enjoy   their   food  in  a  more   congenial\r\n\r\nenvironment.  I am sure this plan will  meet  with\r\n\r\nthe  approval of all the people, particularly  the\r\n\r\nhawkers. In fact, the hawker centres around Farrer\r\n\r\nRoad  Circus and Newton Circus have given  members\r\n\r\nof the public a very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood impression because of their modern facilities\r\n\r\nand  healthy  surroundings.  Thus  more  customers\r\n\r\npatronise them and, in this way, their business is\r\n\r\nimproved. As a result, more hawker complexes  will\r\n\r\nbe built by the Government. This will be good news\r\n\r\nto the hawkers. We all know that lots of them lead\r\n\r\na  difficult life. They have to hawk under the hot\r\n\r\nsun and in heavy rain. In the past, they have been\r\n\r\nneglected. However, ever since the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty  came to power, they have been better looked\r\n\r\nafter. In the past few years, many new market  and\r\n\r\nhawker  centres  have been built  in  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board estates for hawkers to do  their\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Now that the Government is allotting  a\r\n\r\nsum  of  $5  million to improve the hawker  sites,\r\n\r\nmore  benefit  and  business will  come  to  them.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is a wise and judicious measure.  It\r\n\r\nis also a concrete example that the Government has\r\n\r\ndone something for the good of the hawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the addendum regarding the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLaw and National Development, it is mentioned that\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board plans to  build\r\n\r\n100,000 housing units for the period 1971 to 1975.\r\n\r\nThis will double the target it has achieved in the\r\n\r\npast.  In  spite  of  this  rapid  building  plan,\r\n\r\nhowever,   we   are   still   short   of   housing\r\n\r\naccommodation.   The   measures   taken   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have solved some of the acute  housing\r\n\r\nproblems. The hire-purchase ownership plan of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has solved the problem of housing to  a\r\n\r\ngreat extent. This plan has been well received  by\r\n\r\nthe  people. However. I would like to ask  whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government can also extend this sort of hire-purchase terms to renters of H.D.B, shop premises.\r\n\r\nI agree fully with what the Member for Thomson has\r\n\r\nsaid in this House the other day about giving  the\r\n\r\noccupiers  of Housing and Development  Board  shop\r\n\r\npremises certain hire-purchase facilities  to  buy\r\n\r\nshop  premises.  To this regard, I  remember  that\r\n\r\nwhen  we  were  debating  the  Finance  Minister's\r\n\r\nbudget statement in this House some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfour months ago, I put forward some suggestions to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance to enable the  occupiers\r\n\r\nof  Housing and Development Board shop premises to\r\n\r\nbuy  their  shop premises on hire-purchase  terms.\r\n\r\nThe Finance Minister replied that he would have to\r\n\r\nlook  into  the  matter, before he could  give  an\r\n\r\nanswer.  Four  months  have now  passed.  Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister please give his answer to this House?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask concerns\r\n\r\nthe  building construction industry.  Recently  we\r\n\r\nhave  heard some news about the acute shortage  of\r\n\r\ncement.  This shortage will seriously  affect  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board  and  the  private\r\n\r\ndevelopers  who  are engaged in  building  houses.\r\n\r\nTherefore. I would ask the Minister to pay special\r\n\r\nattention  to  the  problem  of  the  shortage  of\r\n\r\ncement,  and to adopt adequate measures to  remedy\r\n\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the addendum relating to the Ministry of Home\r\n\r\nAffairs, there is mention of the reorganisation of\r\n\r\nthe Police Force in order to raise its efficiency,\r\n\r\nprovide  a  better  service  to  the  public, and\r\n\r\nmaintain   law  and  order  in  our  complex   and\r\n\r\nurbanised   society.  No  doubt,  this   is   very\r\n\r\nimportant  as  a  result of the  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  satellite towns and  our  urbanisation\r\n\r\nprogramme.   The  problems  of  social  stability,\r\n\r\nsecurity,  and  the maintenance of law  and  order\r\n\r\nwill  then  be more complex. In order to  maintain\r\n\r\nlaw  and  order, we have to raise the standard  of\r\n\r\nefficiency of the police, but to achieve its  full\r\n\r\neffect,  the co-operation of the people  with  the\r\n\r\npolice  is  needed. The addendum has touched  upon\r\n\r\nthe improvement of salaries to the Police Force. I\r\n\r\nwould say this is reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the addendum has also touched upon\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy in regard to a review  of  the\r\n\r\npresent wage policy which it intends to carry  out\r\n\r\nearly next year. Undoubtedly this is good news  to\r\n\r\nthe  workers  who  have contributed  much  to  our\r\n\r\neconomic development and nation-building.  Because\r\n\r\nof  their  cooperation, commerce and industry  has\r\n\r\nflourished.  So  it is reasonable that  we  should\r\n\r\ngive them a better deal and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigher wages. I fully support the measure. I would\r\n\r\nsay  that  it  is a very judicious policy  to  re-examine the wage policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to making my general comments\r\n\r\non  the various measures which I have just touched\r\n\r\nupon,  I  would like also to deal with  the  other\r\n\r\naspects   outlined   in  the   addendum   to   the\r\n\r\nPresident's   speech  which  relate  to   defence,\r\n\r\neconomy, education, culture and others. If we  can\r\n\r\nfollow  these policies, then we will achieve  more\r\n\r\nin these fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to help in this matter and to benefit\r\n\r\nall  the  people,  I  would  like  to  offer  five\r\n\r\nsuggestions   for   the   consideration   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The national service policy should always be\r\n\r\nexamined, so as to have the welfare of certain\r\n\r\ncategories of national service personnel in mind.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consideration should be given to\r\n\r\nallow  the  only  sons of  parents  who  are\r\n\r\nbreadwinners  of the family to do  part-time\r\n\r\nnational service, or exempt them from national\r\n\r\nservice  altogether. As regards professional\r\n\r\npersonnel  who are required by commerce  and\r\n\r\nindustry, we should give them certain facilities\r\n\r\nto enable them to have more time to serve our\r\n\r\nsociety, because in the President's speech mention\r\n\r\nhas been made of the shortage of such personnel-managers, engineers, and architects. We should\r\n\r\nencourage them and allow them to do part-time\r\n\r\nnational service so that they can contribute more\r\n\r\nto nation-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In the addendum to the President's speech,\r\n\r\nmention has been made of foreign policy.  It\r\n\r\nis  stated that we should pay more attention\r\n\r\nto  events  taking place outside  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  is  correct. In addition to  this,  we\r\n\r\nshould also establish closer and better\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelations  with our neighbouring  countries,\r\n\r\nMalaysia   and   Indonesia,  including   the\r\n\r\nBritish  Commonwealth countries, as this  is\r\n\r\nmutually  beneficial. To achieve  this,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs should work  out\r\n\r\na  programme  whereby Members of Parliament,\r\n\r\nor   leaders  of  the  countries  concerned.\r\n\r\ncould exchange visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Regarding the control or curbing of prices\r\n\r\nof  goods, the Ministry of Finance should do\r\n\r\nmore   work  in  this  respect,  apart  from\r\n\r\ninvestigating  the prices of certain  goods.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  should also  take  additional\r\n\r\neffective   measures   to   safeguard    the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the tax-payers to ensure  that\r\n\r\nopportunities   will   not   be   given   to\r\n\r\nspeculators to increase the prices of  their\r\n\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Ministry of Culture should shoulder\r\n\r\nmore  responsibilities and  duties.  Culture\r\n\r\nand  the arts are an important part  of  the\r\n\r\nspiritual  life of Our people. The  concepts\r\n\r\nof  virtue  and  national loyalty  are  also\r\n\r\nimportant   factors  to  our   people.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   Culture   should   encourage\r\n\r\ndevelopment   and   promotion   of   healthy\r\n\r\ncultural     activities.    The     cultural\r\n\r\nprogrammes   over   Radio   and   Television\r\n\r\nSingapore should also be improved,  so  that\r\n\r\ndecadent  and  bad  culture  will   not   be\r\n\r\nfurther   propagated.   In   addition,   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  should  try to  inculcate  in  the\r\n\r\npeople  a  sense  of national  consciousness\r\n\r\nand  the  idea  of harmonious  living  in  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) There is no mention in the addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresident's  speech of matters  relating  to\r\n\r\nthe rural areas. As a Member representing  a\r\n\r\nrural constituency,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like, in order to be fair,\r\n\r\nto  say  that since the P.A.P, came to power,\r\n\r\nmuch  attention has been given to  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  such as the making of roads,  bridges,\r\n\r\nand  canals, and the installation  of  lights\r\n\r\nand other facilities. The Government has done\r\n\r\nmuch,  but  because of the size of the  rural\r\n\r\nareas, there are still many areas which  need\r\n\r\nto  be developed. Therefore, I would urge the\r\n\r\nMinister    concerned   to   pay   particular\r\n\r\nattention to the rural areas and to  allocate\r\n\r\nmore money in the new financial year for  the\r\n\r\namenities and facilities of the rural people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Sir, the Government's policy speech\r\n\r\nhas  brought  about a new mission in our  task  of\r\n\r\nnation-building.  It  also presents  us  with  new\r\n\r\nchallenges--the  strengthening  of   our   defence\r\n\r\ncapability, the raising of our educational  level,\r\n\r\nthe    development   of   our   industries,    the\r\n\r\nconstruction and rebuilding of our city area,  and\r\n\r\nthe  development  of  our  island  to  make  it  a\r\n\r\nbeautiful  garden  city.  Undoubtedly,  these  are\r\n\r\nnecessary   for  the  progress  of  the   country,\r\n\r\nproviding   a   good  future  and  better   living\r\n\r\nconditions  for  the people. But these  objectives\r\n\r\nmust  have  the support of the people. Though  the\r\n\r\ntasks are difficult, I think there is nothing that\r\n\r\nwe cannot achieve with the concerted effort and co-operation of the people, in fact, in the past  six\r\n\r\nyears,  we  have  in the field of  nation-building\r\n\r\nachieved  many  things. Of course, these  are  not\r\n\r\neasily  achieved.  With careful  planning  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, coupled with the support and hard work\r\n\r\nof  the people, particularly the workers, we  have\r\n\r\nattained our present position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, in the past years we have\r\n\r\nalso   been  faced  with  serious  problems.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  because  of  the  announcement  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish military withdrawal, we are faced with the\r\n\r\nproblem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  more unemployment. All these problems  in\r\n\r\nthe past have been troubling and bothering us. But\r\n\r\nthrough  the  effective planning  of  the  various\r\n\r\ngovernment departments, the rapid building  up  of\r\n\r\nour  armed  forces,  and  the  implementation   of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  and tourist measures,  we  have\r\n\r\nalready overcome the problems one by one.

I\r\n\r\nthink it may be of general interest to Members for\r\n\r\nme to make a somewhat more detailed statement than\r\n\r\nis  contained in the President's speech about  the\r\n\r\nrecent take-over of Haw Par Brothers International\r\n\r\nLtd, by  Slater,  Walker  Securities  Ltd.   The\r\n\r\nreaction to this take-over indicates that there is\r\n\r\nsonic   public  apprehension  in  regard  to   two\r\n\r\nmatters.  One  is  the  extent  to  which  foreign\r\n\r\ninterests  should  he allowed  to  take  over  and\r\n\r\ncontrol  Singapore companies.  The  other  is  the\r\n\r\ndesirability  of  certain  practices  followed  or\r\n\r\nadopted  on take-overs which, though not  illegal,\r\n\r\nwould  constitute  unacceptable  behaviour  in  an\r\n\r\ninternational financial centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that discussion on this subject may\r\n\r\nproceed intelligently, it may he of advantage if  a\r\n\r\nreport  which  has  been compiled  by  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  officials is made available to Members.

However,  it  might  now   be\r\n\r\nopportune  to prepare for an increase in  take-over\r\n\r\nactivities   and  also  consider  whether   certain\r\n\r\ncategories  of Singapore companies should  be  kept\r\n\r\nunder  Singapore  control, for example,  banks  and\r\n\r\ninsurance  companies.  It  is  not  suggested  that\r\n\r\nforeign  interests be totally, excluded in  respect\r\n\r\nof   such  companies.  On  the  contrary,  minority\r\n\r\nforeign   equity  participation   might   even   be\r\n\r\nencouraged  if  it  increases  the  efficiency  and\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness of the local company. Nevertheless,\r\n\r\ncontrol   by   some   system  of  vetting   foreign\r\n\r\nparticipation in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertain designated sectors of commerce and industry\r\n\r\nmay  be necessary and desirable. Perhaps also  some\r\n\r\nequivalent  to  the London Panel on Take-overs  and\r\n\r\nMergers\" is required This Panel has drawn up a  set\r\n\r\nof  rules and established a code of behaviour which\r\n\r\nall parties to a take-over are expected to observe.\r\n\r\nEssentially  the Code drawn up by the London  Panel\r\n\r\nseeks  to ensure early disclosure of details  of  a\r\n\r\nbid so that all shareholders are placed on an equal\r\n\r\nfooting as far as possible, and to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nmajority shareholders do not exploit their position\r\n\r\nat the expense of the minority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other system of regulation is that\r\n\r\nestablished  by  the  American Securities  Exchange\r\n\r\nCommission.   However,  their  approach   is   more\r\n\r\ncumbersome  and  a  number  of  countries.  France.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland  and  Japan, have  been  examining  the\r\n\r\nLondon  Panel's mode of operation in preference  to\r\n\r\nthe  American system. In Singapore it  is  probable\r\n\r\nthat  the London Panel type o approach modified  to\r\n\r\ntake  into  account local conditions  may  be  more\r\n\r\nappropriate. This must be examined in  relation  to\r\n\r\nthe Companies Act and the Securities Industries Act\r\n\r\nwhich are patterned on Australian legislation. I am\r\n\r\nadvised that the Australian Companies Act has  been\r\n\r\nrecently  amended  to deal with takeovers  in  much\r\n\r\ngreater detail, and these amendments might prove of\r\n\r\nhelp in drafting similar regulations for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed that the Ministry of Finance and\r\n\r\nthe  Monetary Authority should, in conjunction with\r\n\r\nthe   Attorney-General,  examine  whether   further\r\n\r\namendments to the Companies Act to deal with  take-overs  are  necessary or desirable, and  whether  a\r\n\r\nLondon Panel type of institution can play a role in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  an  acceptable  code  of  conduct   and\r\n\r\nstandards of behaviour in take-overs and mergers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, of course, the best\r\n\r\nprotection    for    Singapore    companies     and\r\n\r\nshareholders,  as  for companies  and  shareholders\r\n\r\nelsewhere, is to ensure the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nefficiency   and   good   management   of   their\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,I beg to support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I would like to join my colleagues in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  to  thank  the President  for  his  speech\r\n\r\ndelivered at the opening of the Second Session of\r\n\r\nthe  Second  Parliament on Wednesday. 21st  July,\r\n\r\n1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure all Members of this House will\r\n\r\nfully  support  the Government's policy  that  we\r\n\r\nwill not allow anyone to work up heat on the  gut\r\n\r\nissues over language, culture and religion.  Also\r\n\r\nno  one who is working in the mass media has  the\r\n\r\nright to play with the emotional reflexes of  our\r\n\r\ndifferent communities. Let us make it very  clear\r\n\r\nthat  those  who deliberately try  to  encourage.\r\n\r\nstir up or provoke trouble, under the pretence of\r\n\r\nlanguage, culture  or religion,  must  face  the\r\n\r\nconsequences. It is the duty of everyone and  all\r\n\r\nlocal or foreign press here to assist in creating\r\n\r\na , happy, harmonious, tolerant and understanding\r\n\r\nsociety  among  all the people of all  races,  of\r\n\r\ndifferent languages, cultures and religions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also express my full support for the\r\n\r\nmeasures  that this Government will implement  as\r\n\r\noutlined  in the President's speech  and  in  the\r\n\r\naddendum to the speech by the President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the workers in Singapore have done their\r\n\r\nvery   best  to  help  achieve  success  in   our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme and  rapid  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.  Through  their  co-operation  with   the\r\n\r\nemployers  and  Government, there  is  industrial\r\n\r\npeace  which  helps to attract more investors  to\r\n\r\ncome to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Employment Act was passed by\r\n\r\nParliament in 1968, the workers have made  a  lot\r\n\r\nof  sacrifices, especially as they have  to  work\r\n\r\nlonger   hours,   with  lesser  public   holidays\r\n\r\nlimitation of bonus payment wage restraints, etc\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now, most of the employers have enjoyed the\r\n\r\npresent economic boom and they have already  made\r\n\r\nsubstantial  profits as well  as  expanded  their\r\n\r\nbusiness.  I sincerely hope they will  appreciate\r\n\r\nthe workers' sacrifices and their contribution in\r\n\r\nhelping them to make bigger profits. The time has\r\n\r\ncome  when  they  must give  the  workers  better\r\n\r\nbonuses. By the middle of next year, they  should\r\n\r\ngive  substantial wage increases to the  workers.\r\n\r\nSome  of the employers have already responded  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government's appeal to give  bigger  bonuses\r\n\r\nand  I hope more employers will do the same.  The\r\n\r\npresent  wage  restraints  and  the  increase  in\r\n\r\nprices    of    goods   are   causing   financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and  hardships to  the  workers.  I\r\n\r\nwould request the Government to relax the present\r\n\r\npolicy of wage restraints as soon as possible and\r\n\r\nalso  to  take drastic action against shopkeepers\r\n\r\nwho    increase    prices   of   goods    without\r\n\r\njustification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employers are fully aware that prices of\r\n\r\ngoods  have increased substantially and in  spite\r\n\r\nof  the  good profits they are making,  they  are\r\n\r\nstill  reluctant to consider giving  a  temporary\r\n\r\n\"high  cost of living allowance\" to the  workers.\r\n\r\nThis  attitude  is  indeed  very  deplorable  and\r\n\r\nunfair.  Unless the workers get a  fair  wage  to\r\n\r\nmeet the present cost of living, they may have to\r\n\r\ntake drastic action against their employers which\r\n\r\nwill  eventually  disrupt the present  industrial\r\n\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was mentioned in the President's speech\r\n\r\nthat the Government will systematically mechanise\r\n\r\nlaborious and repetitive work. The private sector\r\n\r\nwill be encouraged to do the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, mechanisation is a necessity. I would\r\n\r\nrequest the Government and the private sector  to\r\n\r\ncarry out mechanisation in gradual stages and not\r\n\r\nto  over-do it, so that the workers' job security\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  affected. If the employers  expect\r\n\r\nindustrial peace with the workers. I advise  them\r\n\r\nto accept this request seriously. Should there be\r\n\r\nrapid  mechanisation just purely for the sake  of\r\n\r\nsaving  labour costs and retrenching the workers,\r\n\r\nthere  will be serious trouble. The N.T.U.C, and\r\n\r\nall its affiliated unions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill fight back by taking industrial action. I\r\n\r\nhope this will not happen. I am sure the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not allow such a thing to happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the Government's intention to\r\n\r\namend the Workmen's Compensation Act to cover non-manual  workers who earn up to $750 per month,  to\r\n\r\ntreble   the   quantum  of  workers'  compensation\r\n\r\npayable  at  present, to provide a  more  detailed\r\n\r\nlist  of  injuries which would result in permanent\r\n\r\npartial  incapacity, and to include silicosis  and\r\n\r\nasbestosis   in   the  schedule  of   occupational\r\n\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to touch on public\r\n\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to know that more than 125,000 units\r\n\r\nof  public housing have been completed. More  than\r\n\r\n700,000 people, that is, about 35 per cent of  the\r\n\r\npopulation,   are   now  occupying   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board flats. I must congratulate  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board on the  good  work\r\n\r\nthey  are  doing and I wish them more  success  in\r\n\r\nbuilding more flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board are going to\r\n\r\nbuild  100,000 units for the period 1971 to  1975.\r\n\r\nMay  I  request  the Government  to  increase  its\r\n\r\ntarget to 125,000 units, instead of 100,000 units,\r\n\r\nbecause  most  of  the  working-class  people  can\r\n\r\nafford to rent or buy only Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  flats. The prices of houses and flats built\r\n\r\nby  the private sector are so fantastic that  even\r\n\r\nthe middle-class income group cannot afford to buy\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also request the Government to\r\n\r\nreduce  at  least  50  per cent  of  the  building\r\n\r\nprojects   undertaken  by  the   private   sector,\r\n\r\nespecially on multi-storey flats, terrace  houses,\r\n\r\nsemi-detached houses or bungalows. By putting this\r\n\r\nlimitation  on  them,  construction  workers   and\r\n\r\nbuilding  materials  will  be  available  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to build more Housing and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard fiats. It will eventually eliminate the long\r\n\r\nwaiting  list  for  Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nflats.  Perhaps this exercise will help to prevent\r\n\r\nthe  private sector from increasing the prices  of\r\n\r\nhouses so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfantastically. It will also help the Government to\r\n\r\nbuild another 25,000 units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on the resettlement\r\n\r\nof  hawkers. May I request the Government to adopt\r\n\r\na  policy of flexibility in resettling hawkers  at\r\n\r\nthe market concourse or at hawker centres? I quite\r\n\r\nappreciate  the  importance  of  having  a   clean\r\n\r\nenvironment for the hawkers as well as  for  those\r\n\r\nwho  buy food from them. But to centralise all the\r\n\r\nhawkers into the market concourse temporarily  and\r\n\r\nthen  to  resettle them again finally at a  hawker\r\n\r\ncentre  is  causing hardship to a good  number  of\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government must realise that hawkers cater for a\r\n\r\ncertain number of residents in the housing estate.\r\n\r\nBy  resettling them from a few temporary places in\r\n\r\nthe  housing estate to only one area in the market\r\n\r\nconcourse will cause too many hawkers selling  the\r\n\r\nsame  food. There will be strong competition among\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  this  will lead  to  much  lesser\r\n\r\nprofit or even financial loss. Their customers are\r\n\r\nfrom the residents in the housing estate and quite\r\n\r\nnaturally a resident will not walk a long distance\r\n\r\nfrom  his flat to go to the market just to  buy  a\r\n\r\nbowl  of  kway  teow. Therefore, hawkers  will  be\r\n\r\nlosing their customers and get lesser profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the hawkers selling at Block 27 at\r\n\r\nBukit  Ho  Swee  have been resettled  at  the  Beo\r\n\r\nCrescent    Market   Concourse.    The    hawkers'\r\n\r\nrepresentatives have requested me to appeal to the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board authorities to allow\r\n\r\nthem  to  return  to  Block  27  because  of   the\r\n\r\nfollowing reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Business is not very good at the Beo\r\n\r\nCrescent Market Concourse,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Selling at Block 27, each hawker could make\r\n\r\na  profit  of $5 a day, and now at  the  Beo\r\n\r\nCrescent  Market Concourse, the  profit  has\r\n\r\nbeen reduced to $2 or $3 a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Most of them have families to support\r\n\r\nand  with a small profit of $2 or $3  a  day.\r\n\r\nthey are facing financial difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Strong competition in the market place\r\n\r\nbecause  of too many stalls selling the  same\r\n\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Because of the two-shift system, they\r\n\r\ncannot earn enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) They cannot cater for the residents around Block 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The residents would prefer them to hawk\r\n\r\nin  the  area, i.e., Block 27, because  there\r\n\r\nare   no  shops  in  that  area  and  it   is\r\n\r\nconvenient  for  them to send their  children\r\n\r\ndownstairs to buy food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The space between the blocks in this\r\n\r\narea  is  big  enough for a  row  of  stalls,\r\n\r\nleaving a broad enough space for the passage-way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) They will give full co-operation to keep\r\n\r\nthe place clean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) They are prepared to erect their own\r\n\r\nshelters  with  advice from the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment    Board   and    the    Hawkers'\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already made my appeal on their behalf to\r\n\r\nthe Housing and Development Board authorities, but\r\n\r\ntheir request has been rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appeal to the Government to give\r\n\r\nsympathetic consideration to allow hawkers  to  do\r\n\r\ntheir  business at certain places in  the  housing\r\n\r\nestates  and  they should be under the supervision\r\n\r\nof  the Housing and Development Board and Hawkers'\r\n\r\nDepartment.

For a country with such limited\r\n\r\nnatural  resources as our own, the  progress  made\r\n\r\ncan be considered to be impressive by any standard\r\n\r\nand,   on  this  occasion,  I  think  it  is  only\r\n\r\nappropriate that we should record our appreciation\r\n\r\nof  the  excellent manner in which the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   have   responded  to   the   political\r\n\r\nleadership    in   ensuring   success    in    the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  our  policies.  But  for   the\r\n\r\ndetermination and sacrifices on the  part  of  our\r\n\r\npeople,  all that we have achieved will  not  have\r\n\r\nbeen possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tremendous pace at which we have expected\r\n\r\nour  people to adapt to changes can be  seen  from\r\n\r\nthe large number of Bills submitted and passed  by\r\n\r\nthis  House during the last session of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt  may  interest the House to know that some  140\r\n\r\nBills  were passed during the last Parliament  and\r\n\r\nhave   since   become   laws.   Inevitably,    the\r\n\r\nimplementation of some, if not all, of these  laws\r\n\r\nhave  brought  about temporary inconveniences  and\r\n\r\neven  hardships to certain sections of the public.\r\n\r\nWhilst  every  endeavour has been made  to  lessen\r\n\r\nsuch inconveniences and hardships, there have been\r\n\r\nareas  where  we  could  perhaps  have  been  more\r\n\r\nconsiderate  or generous. A case in point  is  the\r\n\r\nrate  of compensation paid to farmers affected  by\r\n\r\nland acquisition. In this connection, I am pleased\r\n\r\nto  note the Government's decision to give  higher\r\n\r\nrates  of  compensation to tenants and  ex  gratia\r\n\r\npayments to squatters for resettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from adequate monetary compensation,\r\n\r\nit  is also essential, to my mind, to ensure  that\r\n\r\nwhen  people  are  resettled,  the  facilities  or\r\n\r\namenities  available to them in the new areas  are\r\n\r\nat  least  of the same standard as, if not  higher\r\n\r\nthan,  that enjoyed by them previously. In  saying\r\n\r\nso.  I  have  in mind instances in the past  where\r\n\r\npeople in areas already provided with water and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelectricity were resettled in areas without  such\r\n\r\nmodern  amenities. I am sure that there  must  be\r\n\r\nother    parallel   cases   arising   from    the\r\n\r\nimplementation of our policies. In our next phase\r\n\r\nof development, I feel it is important that we do\r\n\r\nnot  lose sight of the need to minimise any human\r\n\r\nmiseries or inconveniences brought about  by  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of any of our policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in his speech, the President\r\n\r\nhas  emphasised  the need for our  investors  and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  to  develop new attitudes  and  to\r\n\r\nacquire   the   necessary   sophistication    and\r\n\r\nexpertise  for  the management of industries  and\r\n\r\nother enterprises. Sir,I have no doubt that  our\r\n\r\nnormally  responsive business leaders  will  take\r\n\r\nheed  of  the  advice. However, I feel  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   can   help   by   setting   up    an\r\n\r\ninternational business school where our  business\r\n\r\nexecutives, especially the younger ones,  may  go\r\n\r\nfor  the  necessary orientation  and  develop  an\r\n\r\ninternational outlook. The courses  conducted  at\r\n\r\nsuch  a  school may aim particularly at providing\r\n\r\nparticipants    with   a   good   knowledge    of\r\n\r\ninternational   business   operations   and   the\r\n\r\npolitical, social and economic conditions of  the\r\n\r\nworld  at  large.  As we become  increasingly  an\r\n\r\ninternational trading and financial centre, it is\r\n\r\nessential  that  our businessmen  are  made  more\r\n\r\naware  of  methods, practices and  conditions  of\r\n\r\ninternational business. This will,  in  the  long\r\n\r\nrun,  help  to improve the sales of our  products\r\n\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of export business, I take this\r\n\r\nopportunity  of asking the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nwhether he is satisfied with the progress made by\r\n\r\nIntraco to date in assisting local industries  in\r\n\r\nthe  promotion  of  the sales of  their  products\r\n\r\nabroad.  Only  too often Government agencies  are\r\n\r\ninclined  or tempted to allow the purely  profit-making  motive to over-ride all other  wider  and\r\n\r\nequally  important,  if not  more  so,  long-term\r\n\r\nconsiderations which have originally prompted the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of  such agencies. It is  important,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that  the  operations  of  all   such\r\n\r\nagencies should be brought under constant  review\r\n\r\nfrom time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  time  so as to ensure that they do  not  lose\r\n\r\nsight of the overall objectives. Whilst we expect\r\n\r\nthese agencies to be financially viable, we  also\r\n\r\nexpect  them  in  the  long run  to  provide  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  leadership to the  private  sector  in\r\n\r\nbringing about a higher standard of expertise and\r\n\r\nsophistication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I endorse the motion tabled by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Ulu Pandan. The present Government has\r\n\r\nhad   more   than  10  years  of  experience   in\r\n\r\ngovernment. During this period we have  seen  the\r\n\r\npolicy  statements of the present Government.  We\r\n\r\nhave also seen with our own eyes the progress and\r\n\r\nachievements  made  under the leadership  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government. We have also seen  the  rapid\r\n\r\nprogress made in nation-building. Because of  all\r\n\r\nthis, I believe that the prospects of development\r\n\r\nthat lie ahead of us can be seen clearly from the\r\n\r\npolicy  statement delivered in this House  a  few\r\n\r\ndays  ago. If we can forecast future developments\r\n\r\nfrom our present achievements, then conversely we\r\n\r\ncan  also look back at our achievements from  the\r\n\r\nprospects that lie ahead. So when we make a study\r\n\r\nof  the present policy statement, it is also time\r\n\r\nthat  we  made  a  review  of  our  efforts   and\r\n\r\nachievements so far. If our efforts so  far  have\r\n\r\nnot  brought about higher achievements, then from\r\n\r\nthe  present policy statement we can only see the\r\n\r\nrepetition of old problems. But this is  not  the\r\n\r\ncase,  because from the policy statement and  the\r\n\r\naddendum,  we  can see a lot of new problems  and\r\n\r\nnew  prospects.  All these new problems  and  new\r\n\r\nprospects  have  been brought about  by  progress\r\n\r\nmade  in the past. We have to know what we intend\r\n\r\nto do in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, at the present moment, we have\r\n\r\nmore  than  700,000 people living in Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board flats. According to the  latest\r\n\r\nplan  of  the  Government, in 1975  some  half  a\r\n\r\nmillion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  will be living in Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard flats. So the total number of people living\r\n\r\nin  Housing Board accommodation by 1975  will  be\r\n\r\nmore than half the population of Singapore. This,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, will indeed be a new development\r\n\r\nwhich  we  can see from the Presidential Address.\r\n\r\nThis  is something heartening and gratifying that\r\n\r\ncould hardly be foreseen in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be unthinkable if this kind of\r\n\r\nforecast  were  made in 1959. In  fact,  we  have\r\n\r\nalready  come  to  a  stage of development  which\r\n\r\ncould  not  be imagined in 1959. I   have  looked\r\n\r\ninto  an  early  publication of the  P.A.P..  The\r\n\r\nTasks  Ahead,  and found that the  various  items\r\n\r\nlisted  and planned in this publication  as  aims\r\n\r\nhave  come  to pass. The ideals of the past  have\r\n\r\nbecome the achievements of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 60,000 people in my constituency, Bukit\r\n\r\nMerah,  are also enjoying in many ways the fruits\r\n\r\nof the progress made. What we can see there is  a\r\n\r\nsituation  of the city engulfing the countryside,\r\n\r\nand  not  the countryside engulfing the  city  as\r\n\r\npropounded by the Communists. We can see also the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  urban renewal being carried  out  in\r\n\r\nHong  Lim Constituency which I any assisting, in\r\n\r\nan  area  of  1,700 acres, which had  about  one-quarter  of  the population of Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\npast,  the pace of urban renewal is being stepped\r\n\r\nup.  So very soon we shall be able to sec  a  new\r\n\r\nlook, a new face lift, not only in this place but\r\n\r\nalso in Sembawang and all over the island. We are\r\n\r\nalso  certain that the pragmatic approach of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is very praiseworthy. Whether it is in\r\n\r\nterms of urban renewal or rural resettlement, the\r\n\r\npeople   affected  are  invariably   faced   with\r\n\r\nproblems  to  some extent, in this  respect,  the\r\n\r\nGovern-merit has already decided to increase  the\r\n\r\nrate  of compensation and ex, gratia payments  to\r\n\r\nthose  people affected by the resettlement scheme\r\n\r\nso  that  their  difficulties can be  alleviated.\r\n\r\nThis   is   another  indication  of  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment's  pragmatism  and  its  sincerity  in\r\n\r\nlooking after the interests of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe people. Mr Speaker. Sir, if over the past few\r\n\r\nyears   our   national  economy  had   not   been\r\n\r\nconsolidated  and  there had  not  been  so  much\r\n\r\nprogress,  we  would not have been  able  now  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  rate  of  compensation  for  these\r\n\r\npeople. If we look around us, we can see that  we\r\n\r\nare  now able to do this all because we have been\r\n\r\nable  to look after the national interests first.\r\n\r\nIt is only after the national interests have been\r\n\r\nwell  taken  care  of that individual  and  group\r\n\r\ninterests can be better looked after more easily.\r\n\r\nThis is an example for the present as well as the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress or prosperity may not bring about more\r\n\r\nprogress or more prosperity as a rule. It may, in\r\n\r\nfact, bring about some new problems, for example,\r\n\r\nthe  case of rising wages, if this problem is not\r\n\r\nproperly handled, it may result in inflation. The\r\n\r\nincrease   in   the  rate  of  compensation   for\r\n\r\nresettled  people  will in certain  circumstances\r\n\r\ngive rise to an increase in the price of land. In\r\n\r\nspite of all that, we cannot throw away the apple\r\n\r\nbecause  of the core. Therefore, we must look  at\r\n\r\nthis  problem from various angles.  Where  it  is\r\n\r\npossible,  we  will increase wages at  the  right\r\n\r\ntime,  anc1, also,  if necessary,  the  rate  of\r\n\r\ncompensation.  By doing the right  thing  at  the\r\n\r\nright  time, we can achieve our wishes which  can\r\n\r\nonly   be  translated  into  reality  under   the\r\n\r\nenlightened  leadership of  the  People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty.  Without  this enlightened leadership,  we\r\n\r\ncan only see these things in our dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been trying to express my views in\r\n\r\nas few words as possible to reflect my confidence\r\n\r\nin  the  present Government, and I would like  to\r\n\r\nendorse  my support for the motion of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Ulu Pandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan (Nee Soon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  Sir, from the status of self-government\r\n\r\nin    the   l960s   to   nation-building    after\r\n\r\nindependence  and the serious challenges  in  the\r\n\r\nface  of  multifarious problems in the 1970s,  we\r\n\r\nhave gone through a period of trial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  tribulation,  but have finally  emerged  as  a\r\n\r\nsuccessful  and  stable country in  this  turbulent\r\n\r\nregion  of  South-east Asia. The internal political\r\n\r\nstability,  the economic development, the  rise  in\r\n\r\nour   Gross  National  Product,  the  international\r\n\r\nprestige  we  have  built up, the establishment  of\r\n\r\ntrade  links  with  more and  more  countries,  the\r\n\r\ngradual  development of Singapore as the  financial\r\n\r\ncentre  of  South-east Asia and as  an  example  to\r\n\r\ndeveloping countries - all these achievements  have\r\n\r\nbeen brought about by the cohesiveness and unity of\r\n\r\nour  people. For a better future, we still have  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on  working hard for what  we  have  already\r\n\r\nachieved. Complacency, no doubt, is a hindrance  to\r\n\r\nprogress, but to ask for too much without regard to\r\n\r\nthe   practical  and  objective  circumstances   is\r\n\r\nequally  bad. The fortuitous process through  which\r\n\r\nour  unique  immigrant society has  developed  from\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule  to  internal  self-government  and,\r\n\r\nfinally, independence provides many lessons for  us\r\n\r\nand  our  future  generations  to  remember.  These\r\n\r\nlessons  make us vigilant and appreciative  of  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the harmony and stability  that  we  are\r\n\r\nenjoying as a multi-racial country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a Singapore citizen is something to be\r\n\r\nproud  of.  This  is because we  have  built  up  a\r\n\r\ncountry  from  the  unity and cohesion  of  several\r\n\r\nraces,   cultures  and  religions.  Through  mutual\r\n\r\nunderstanding, mutual help and mutual tolerance, we\r\n\r\nhave  built  a foundation of oneness based  on  the\r\n\r\nconfluence of many units. We must continue to  work\r\n\r\nhard  to consolidate this foundation and to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat nation-building is above all other objectives.\r\n\r\nIt  is  important  that we establish  our  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness   and  unity  of   purpose.   It   is\r\n\r\nunfortunate, however, that when we are  engaged  in\r\n\r\nthe   supreme  task  of  nation-building  and   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of unity of purpose, divisive  words\r\n\r\nare  being spread in all directions. This  is  very\r\n\r\ndangerous.  The people behind this even attempt  to\r\n\r\ngo through the cultural front in order to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvocate  divisive thinking among our people.  They\r\n\r\nexploit the various complicated and acute issues in\r\n\r\nour country in order to whip up suspicion among our\r\n\r\npeople  in  the hope that they will cause  communal\r\n\r\nconflict, and to undermine and destroy whatever  we\r\n\r\nhave built. The consequences will be tragic if they\r\n\r\nsucceed,  because the people will  then  be  living\r\n\r\nwith one another in a state of hostility or forever\r\n\r\nbecome  the  slaves of others. If we  do  not  take\r\n\r\ntimely  and  decisive  steps  to  stop  all   these\r\n\r\npervasive  divisive  influences,  all  the   unity,\r\n\r\ncohesion and foundation that we have built up  will\r\n\r\nbe corroded and destroyed. What will then become of\r\n\r\nour  society and our country? Of course, the result\r\n\r\nwill be unthinkable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time when we are taking decisive steps to\r\n\r\nstop  all  these  pervasive  divisive  forces  from\r\n\r\noperating  in our country, there are some  ignorant\r\n\r\npeople who blindly accuse the Government of killing\r\n\r\nthe  freedom of the press. Indeed, freedom  of  the\r\n\r\npress  is one of the basic principles of democracy.\r\n\r\nIn  its  turn,  the press also has a responsibility\r\n\r\nand obligation towards the nation. But all this  is\r\n\r\nrelative.  It does not mean that the abuse  of  the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  speech beyond the  ambit  of  the  law\r\n\r\nshould  be permitted. Neither does it mean that  we\r\n\r\nshould  allow  the exploitation of the  freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech against the national interest. No doubt,  it\r\n\r\nis  a  privilege  and  a right that  every  citizen\r\n\r\nshould  be  able to express his views  openly,  but\r\n\r\nbetween the right and the obligation, we must  find\r\n\r\na  proper  balance  so that the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nentire nation will be looked after according to the\r\n\r\nsocial  conscience. Only then will the  freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech  and  expression find significance.  At  the\r\n\r\npresent  stage  of  our  nation-building,  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness is still in the formative  stage.  We\r\n\r\nshould not compare ourselves with countries with  a\r\n\r\nlonger  history, particularly when we are a  multi-racial, multi-cultural and multi-religious society.\r\n\r\nWe  must  not allow the poison of divisive thinking\r\n\r\nto spread\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namong  our people, if we allow things to go  their\r\n\r\nown way, many ignorant people will break away from\r\n\r\nthe  nation.  Freedom  of  speech  and  expression\r\n\r\nshould  be  in keeping with our national policies.\r\n\r\nWe  welcome constructive criticism, criticism made\r\n\r\non  an objective basis, particularly in regard  to\r\n\r\nany   deviation  in  the  implementation  of   our\r\n\r\nnational policies. On the contrary, if the freedom\r\n\r\nof  expression is abused and exploited,  then  the\r\n\r\nharm  done  to  the country will be  immeasurable,\r\n\r\nOnly responsible freedom of speech will have value\r\n\r\nand relevance to our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been stressing the importance of cohesion\r\n\r\namong our multi-racial people because as a society\r\n\r\nwe  are  unique, if  we do not  do  our  best  to\r\n\r\npreserve  all the achievements made,  we  will  be\r\n\r\nheading  for destruction. Our country  is  like  a\r\n\r\nsophisticated  machine.  All  the  parts  must  be\r\n\r\nproperly  operated and synchronised. If  there  is\r\n\r\nany  loose  part,  the whole machinery  will  stop\r\n\r\noperating  or  go out of order.  This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nsimple example. We can learn a lot of lessons  and\r\n\r\nsee  many examples of what has happened around us.\r\n\r\nThe facts are cruel, but we must not try to escape\r\n\r\nfrom   reality.  We  must  instead   sharpen   our\r\n\r\nvigilance and take preventive measures for what is\r\n\r\nto  come,  otherwise we will be very  foolish.  In\r\n\r\norder  to ensure that our stability and prosperity\r\n\r\nwill  continue,  all the people in Singapore  must\r\n\r\nunite   together   and  heighten  their   national\r\n\r\nconsciousness.  They must always  remain  vigilant\r\n\r\nand be in a position to know who are their enemies\r\n\r\nand who are their friends so that they will not be\r\n\r\nexploited.  The  future is unpredictable.  In  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of self-preservation there should  be  no\r\n\r\nrelaxation on our part. Only then shall we be able\r\n\r\nto   stand  forever  and  enjoy  our  freedom   in\r\n\r\ninternational politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  Singapore  is  a  country   mainly\r\n\r\ndependent  on industry and commerce.

All this is very correct. On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, greater efforts are still needed  for\r\n\r\nthe  development of managerial and executive staff\r\n\r\nand  personnel for our big companies.  The  recent\r\n\r\nincidents  involving Eupoc, the Starlight  company\r\n\r\nand  a  British financial group show that we  lack\r\n\r\nmanagerial   talent.

We  could then have  more  of  such\r\n\r\npersonnel  for  our industries. With  the  courses\r\n\r\njointly  conducted  by  the  two  universities,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve   we  should  be  able  to  get   suitable\r\n\r\npersonnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has rightly said that food alone\r\n\r\nis  not enough to bring up a good citizen. We must\r\n\r\nhave  proper  educational and cultural activities.\r\n\r\nWe must provide the mental pabulum needed. Because\r\n\r\nof  the  present  lack  of  mental  pabulum,  even\r\n\r\nundesirable publications are welcomed by many. The\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture says that the Government  has\r\n\r\nrecently  confiscated and destroyed  about  20,000\r\n\r\ncopies  of  undesirable chain-picture publications\r\n\r\nmeant  for  children. I do not know the number  of\r\n\r\nsuch publications for children and adults that are\r\n\r\nstill in circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut   prohibition  and  confiscation  are  passive\r\n\r\nmeasures.   These  undesirable  publications   are\r\n\r\nbrought into Singapore because there is a cultural\r\n\r\nand  spiritual vacuum. The best way to  fill  that\r\n\r\nvacuum is to produce our own publications. We have\r\n\r\nmany  writers  and painters. The Government  could\r\n\r\nutilise  their  services and ask them  to  produce\r\n\r\neducational, meaningful and desirable articles for\r\n\r\npublication. Only then will we be able to  counter\r\n\r\nsuch  undesirable  publications  and  reduce   our\r\n\r\ndependence  on  imported ones, and supply  healthy\r\n\r\npublications to our citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are a multi-lingual society\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministry of Education must  improve  the\r\n\r\ntechnique  of  teaching the second  and  even  the\r\n\r\nfirst  language. Research has shown that the  best\r\n\r\ntime  for  children to learn a second language  is\r\n\r\nwhen  they are under 12 years old, i.e., when they\r\n\r\nare  in  the primary school. Therefore, we  should\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on  the teaching of languages  during\r\n\r\nthis  period to get the maximum effect. There  are\r\n\r\nlanguage  laboratories in the various institutions\r\n\r\nof  higher learning and the Adult Education Board.\r\n\r\nBut  there  is  no co-ordination and  co-operation\r\n\r\namong  these  institutions  in  the  teaching   of\r\n\r\nlanguages. The Ministry of Education can therefore\r\n\r\nset up a unifying body, such as an advisory centre\r\n\r\non   the   teaching   of   languages   among   the\r\n\r\ninstitutions. Then the activities and planning  of\r\n\r\nthese  institutions would be properly coordinated,\r\n\r\nplanned  and  directed to function satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThat  would  greatly  help in teaching  languages,\r\n\r\nboth inside and outside the schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson) In Tamil:</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, His Excellency the President made  a\r\n\r\nspeech at the Opening of the Second Session of the\r\n\r\nSecond  Parliament, and I support the  Address  of\r\n\r\nthanks  proposed. I wish to give my own views.  We\r\n\r\nhave to encourage the establishment of a more just\r\n\r\nand  equal  society. The speech is  tantamount  to\r\n\r\nthat.  We  have  to  devise  ways  and  means   to\r\n\r\nestablish a disciplined\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsociety. Language, culture and religion should not\r\n\r\nbe   divisive  factors.  They  should,  in   fact,\r\n\r\ncontribute  to unity among the various races.  But\r\n\r\nthere will be unity only when multi-racial, multi-religious  and multi-lingual ties are  steadfastly\r\n\r\nknitted together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the prices of commodities are\r\n\r\nincreasing. The Government is in fact taking steps\r\n\r\nto check the price increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has announced, through His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the  President,  certain  policies.  I\r\n\r\nsupport them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, school children, the Police and\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces personnel, workers, and other people\r\n\r\nbelonging to establishments and institutions, will\r\n\r\nbe  staging  a mammoth show to celebrate  National\r\n\r\nDay. They have to rehearse the show a few times in\r\n\r\norder   to  produce  a  good  show.  They   should\r\n\r\ntherefore be given leave to attend rehearsals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been independent for six years. Within\r\n\r\nthis  short period we have overcome many  problems\r\n\r\nand   have   made   progress.   When   we   became\r\n\r\nindependent,  the  people  around  us  had  doubts\r\n\r\nwhether  we could make the grade. But contrary  to\r\n\r\ntheir expectations, we have gone forward. This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Government has worked hard  and  the\r\n\r\npublic     have    given    their    co-operation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is a hindrance.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nBritish   military  withdrawal.  When   this   was\r\n\r\nannounced,  we  were afraid that  there  would  be\r\n\r\nunemployment.  Due to our leaders'  foresight,  we\r\n\r\nhave   solved  that  problem.  We  are  not   only\r\n\r\nindustrialising  quite rapidly, but  we  are  also\r\n\r\nemploying trained foreigners who come here on work\r\n\r\npermits. But in doing this, the Government  should\r\n\r\nbe  careful not to create unemployment  among  our\r\n\r\nown  citizens. Perhaps the holders of work permits\r\n\r\ncome  here  to work for a lesser salary,  and  the\r\n\r\nemployers  may  also make use of this  opportunity\r\n\r\npermanently. In this respect the Government should\r\n\r\nbe cautious. Our citizens should not only be given\r\n\r\nproper   training,  but  they   should   also   be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded against unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a small nation. Therefore, some may\r\n\r\nask  whether  it  is necessary to  have  a  bigger\r\n\r\ndefence  force. But I would like to ask  them  one\r\n\r\nquestion. Why are we having gates and doors to our\r\n\r\nown houses? It is because we want security. In the\r\n\r\nsame  way, our country should also be made secure.\r\n\r\nSo  it does not matter even if we spend more money\r\n\r\non  defence. It would be helpful to our  progress.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to  buy new equipment for  training  our\r\n\r\narmed forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to create a more equal and just\r\n\r\nsociety.  We also have a duty to build houses  for\r\n\r\nthe  people.  But we need land for other  projects\r\n\r\ntoo.  So when people are affected by resettlement,\r\n\r\nI   hope   they   will  be  satisfied   with   the\r\n\r\ncompensation they get from the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I would offer two suggestions.\r\n\r\nWhen   the   Government   take   over   land   for\r\n\r\nredevelopment,  if for some reason  they  are  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  develop it immediately, I suggest  they\r\n\r\noffer it to the private sector for development. As\r\n\r\nfar  as  industrial development is concerned,  the\r\n\r\nsame  privileges offered to foreigners should also\r\n\r\nbe  offered to local people. When the local people\r\n\r\nwant  to erect buildings for industries, they have\r\n\r\nto  comply  with  certain building regulations.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Government  will relax  some  of  these\r\n\r\nregulations for local people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is necessary for life. Before building\r\n\r\nmore  houses,  the  Government  should  have  more\r\n\r\nreservoirs. The rain water should be channelled to\r\n\r\nthe  various reservoirs so that at any  time  they\r\n\r\nwill  be filled. I suggest that farmers use  pumps\r\n\r\nto  draw well water. Then they could make  use  of\r\n\r\nthe  well  water for their needs. In the way,  the\r\n\r\nwater  shortage could be overcome. Other countries\r\n\r\nhave well facilities too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I praise the Health Ministry for doing a good\r\n\r\njob.  There are less mosquitoes now. This is  very\r\n\r\nencouraging.  Measures have  also  been  taken  to\r\n\r\ncontrol pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope more dispensaries could be built near\r\n\r\nhousing  estates.  There  are  no  facilities  for\r\n\r\nmedical  treatment at night except  in  Government\r\n\r\nhospitals.   Private  doctors   in   the   various\r\n\r\nconstituencies  should open their  clinics  during\r\n\r\nthe  night.  They could take turns to be  on  duty\r\n\r\nduring  the  night.  I  hope  the  Minister   will\r\n\r\napproach them on this suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has given equal treatment to all the\r\n\r\nfour  languages. It has been successful  in  doing\r\n\r\nthat.  Moreover,  two languages  are  compulsorily\r\n\r\ntaught  in  schools  now.  In  future,  when   our\r\n\r\nchildren know two or more languages, they will  be\r\n\r\nable  to understand one another better. They  will\r\n\r\nthen live in a better society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to comment on Tamil education. In\r\n\r\nTamil  primary schools, the second language should\r\n\r\nbe  taught  in  such a way that  it  benefits  the\r\n\r\npupils.  When  we teach languages in  schools,  we\r\n\r\nshould  be careful not to create trouble over  the\r\n\r\nlanguage   issue,   as  has  happened   in   other\r\n\r\ncountries. I hope the Minister will take  note  of\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has tremendously improved the\r\n\r\ncommunication  system. I praise the  Minister  who\r\n\r\nreorganised  the transport system.  But  there  is\r\n\r\nstill vehicle congestion at certain places. E hope\r\n\r\nthis will be overcome soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to praise the Police Force and make a\r\n\r\nrequest  to the Home Affairs Minister.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany  foreigners who come to Singapore. Once  they\r\n\r\nare  here, they are given the opportunity to  stay\r\n\r\nhere  permanently and get citizenship. At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  the Minister should pay attention and  give\r\n\r\ncitizenship to those who have stayed  here  for  a\r\n\r\nlong  time. Also, when those people who  are  born\r\n\r\nand bred in Singapore marry foreigners, I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister  will make the necessary arrangements  to\r\n\r\ngrant  citizenship to foreigners who  marry  local\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Ulu Pandan for moving the Address  of\r\n\r\nthanks to the President for his speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order.
