Member. $18 million\r\n\r\nis the increase in the added value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To earn the extra $46 million, the PUB has spent\r\n\r\n$207.74  million in 1974 and $285.93 million in  1975\r\n\r\non  the provision of infrastructure necessary to meet\r\n\r\nthe  increasing demand for power, water and  gas.  In\r\n\r\nthe  last  three  years, the PUB  has  spent  $758.35\r\n\r\nmillion  on  capital expenditure and  had  to  borrow\r\n\r\n$410.34 million to finance development projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumption of electricity has increased by 7.2 1%\r\n\r\nand  gas  by 9.47% in 1975. In both cases, there  has\r\n\r\nbeen no increase in tariffs since February 1974, and\r\n\r\nthe increase in revenue can be said to be due largely\r\n\r\nto the increase in consumption or sales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tariff for electricity, for the information of\r\n\r\nMembers,  is  based on a fuel oil price of  $160  per\r\n\r\ntonne,  and I would like Members to note that  though\r\n\r\nthe price of fuel oil increased to $182 per tonne  in\r\n\r\nOctober  1975,  that is, an increase of  13.75%, the\r\n\r\ntariff  for electricity has not been raised. For  the\r\n\r\ntime being the PUB is able to absorb this increase in\r\n\r\nfuel  oil  price  and  other higher  operating  costs\r\n\r\nwithout  passing it on to consumers, largely  because\r\n\r\nof   increased   efficiency  in  the  generation   of\r\n\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly for gas, because of greater efficiency,\r\n\r\nthe PUB is also able to absorb increases in the price\r\n\r\nof naphtha without increasing the price of gas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water tariffs, however, were revised upwards in\r\n\r\nOctober  1975, and this was to encourage  economy  in\r\n\r\nthe use of water. It was also because the PUB had  to\r\n\r\nspend  $1  37.3  million on two  major  water  supply\r\n\r\nprojects, i.e, the Upper Peirce  and  Kranji/Pandan\r\n\r\nSchemes,  to  augment our water supply,  storage  and\r\n\r\ntreatment capacities in order to cope with increasing\r\n\r\nconsumption. Consumption for 1975 increased by 8.47%.\r\n\r\nIt also costs more to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreat  raw water which is as polluted as the kind  we\r\n\r\nare getting from the Kranji/Pandan Dam. Incidentally,\r\n\r\nwe are most fortunate in that we are able to complete\r\n\r\nthese  schemes before the recent drought.  Otherwise.\r\n\r\nMembers  would  have to miss their  daily  baths  and\r\n\r\nwould not look as clean as they do now. And if we had\r\n\r\nnot  completed these projects, there would have  been\r\n\r\nwater  rationing or some other form of self-restraint\r\n\r\nwould have been necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water, as we know, is becoming increasingly\r\n\r\nexpensive  to  tap  as the PUB has  to  develop  less\r\n\r\neconomic sources of supply.

Actual growth  is\r\n\r\nrunning  at the rate of 20% per year while  projected\r\n\r\ngrowth was only 1 5% per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep pace with this rate of growth, the\r\n\r\nAuthority  is  investing  vast  sums  of   money   on\r\n\r\nequipment and cables as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\nFinancial       Capital Expenditure\r\n\r\n   Year              Million $\r\n\r\n1971                    35.7\r\n\r\n1972/73                 29.9\r\n\r\n1973/74                 27.6\r\n\r\n1974/75                 53.6\r\n\r\n1975/76 (estimate)     108.0\r\n\r\n1976/77 (budgetted)    152.0\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs development gathers momentum, the waiting list for\r\n\r\ntelephones  which  is  now  1  5.4%  of  total  lines\r\n\r\ninstalled would be brought down progressively to just\r\n\r\nover  10% by the end of this year, and to 8%  by  the\r\n\r\nend  of 1977.

If  caught  by  the\r\n\r\ntraffic enforcement officers, they will be booked  for\r\n\r\ninconsiderate  or even dangerous driving.  Motor-cycle\r\n\r\nand  scooter  riders  should  move  with  the  general\r\n\r\ntraffic  and observe the speed limits imposed for  the\r\n\r\nstretch of road they are travelling on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, it is desirable to segregate and to have\r\n\r\nseparate  lanes for the different types  of  vehicles.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Singapore the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshortage of land and limited road space have made  it\r\n\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, for this to be so, and\r\n\r\nserious problems especially at road junctions will be\r\n\r\nencountered if segregation of vehicles is  practised.\r\n\r\nA  good  example is our bus lane which is not without\r\n\r\nits  problems. However, in this case the benefits far\r\n\r\noutweigh the disadvantages. Even then, bus lanes have\r\n\r\nbeen introduced only to certain main roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a requirement of law, as well as simple\r\n\r\ncourtesy,  that slow-moving vehicles should  move  on\r\n\r\nthe left lane to allow faster vehicles to proceed  on\r\n\r\nthe  lane  to the right without hindrance.  The  left\r\n\r\nlane  is  thus meant for use by slow-moving  vehicles\r\n\r\nsuch as buses and goods vehicles. It would, hence, be\r\n\r\nmost  unfair to confine motor-cycles and scooters  to\r\n\r\nthe  left  lane  as  they  would  have  to  move   at\r\n\r\nunrealistic slow speeds among the heavy vehicles  and\r\n\r\nthis  is  dangerous for them. The existing  situation\r\n\r\nallows flexibility and is desirable since most of our\r\n\r\ncarriageways have only two lanes. If a motorcycle  or\r\n\r\na  scooter rider is moving slowly, he should keep  to\r\n\r\nthe  left lane. If he moves faster and wants  to  by-pass a slow-moving vehicle in front, he can do so  in\r\n\r\nthe outer lane to the right. However, at all times he\r\n\r\nshould  observe all traffic regulations, and  traffic\r\n\r\nenforcement  officers are keeping a  sharp  watch  to\r\n\r\nensure that this is being done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts will continue to be made to educate motor-cycle and scooter riders on the rules and regulations\r\n\r\nregarding  road  use.  The requirement  as  from  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary,   1974  that  provisional  driving   licence\r\n\r\nholders  should pass their Highway Code  test  before\r\n\r\nbeing  allowed to drive or ride on the road has  also\r\n\r\nhelped  to  reduce  traffic  offences  and  accidents\r\n\r\ncaused by motor-cycle and scooter riders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I am just wondering\r\n\r\nif  the  Hon.

On the  other  hand,  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board appears to be determined  to  stultify\r\n\r\nevery  attempt  at neighbourliness by imposing  petty\r\n\r\nrestrictions, such as the closing of car parks at  10\r\n\r\np.m, and even at 7 p.m, in some estates. This  makes\r\n\r\nit difficult for residents to receive friends for any\r\n\r\nlength of time in the evenings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is difficult to comprehend the rationale\r\n\r\nbehind  this  restriction if  the  Housing  Board  is\r\n\r\nreally   sincere  in  their  attempt   to   encourage\r\n\r\nneighbourliness and cohesiveness among the  residents\r\n\r\nin  the  housing  estates. I  believe  that  in  some\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  visitors are  allowed  to  use  the\r\n\r\nHousing Board car parks until 11 p.m. If this is  so,\r\n\r\nwhy  is  it not allowed in other HDB housing estates?\r\n\r\nThis  extension will at least allow friends  to  meet\r\n\r\nfor  a  few  hours after work. In fact,  the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  should  permit visitors to utilise  their  car\r\n\r\nparks until\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmidnight.   I   am  sure  that  there   can   be   no\r\n\r\nadministrative problem in keeping the  Housing  Board\r\n\r\ncar parks open till midnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have suggested extension of use of the car\r\n\r\nparks  until  midnight because as  Singapore  becomes\r\n\r\nurbanised   so   also   must   the   life-styles   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  change. Thirty years ago when  we  were\r\n\r\nless urbanised and less industrialised, life went  on\r\n\r\nat a slower pace and most people retire early to bed.\r\n\r\nLiving in flats and apartments and the tempo of  life\r\n\r\ntoday, including television, have all contributed  to\r\n\r\nencouraging or even compelling Singaporeans to  sleep\r\n\r\nlate.  Because of longer working hours and  transport\r\n\r\nproblems,   social  calls  to  friends  are   usually\r\n\r\npossible  only  after  8 p.m.,  and  if  visitors  to\r\n\r\nresidents  in  Housing Board estates  have  to  clear\r\n\r\ntheir cars out by 10 p.m, it leaves very little  time\r\n\r\nindeed  for  them to socialise. We  have  not  got  a\r\n\r\nwonderful  public transport system to encourage  them\r\n\r\nto travel in public transport. They therefore have to\r\n\r\ntravel in their own motor cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, young couples living in Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flats  have been encouraged  to  invite  their\r\n\r\nparents  to  visit them frequently and to  help  look\r\n\r\nafter  their  children when they  are  out.  But  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board's car park rules make this practically\r\n\r\nimpossible if grandparents who make the visit by  car\r\n\r\nhave to clear out by 10p.m. This 10 p.m-deadline  has\r\n\r\na  very  unsettling and unnerving effect on  visitors\r\n\r\nbecause if, by any chance, they are delayed by a  few\r\n\r\nminutes they may find their cars locked in or parking\r\n\r\nposts  chained  at  the whims of  the  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nofficials. Moreover, they will also be subject  to  a\r\n\r\nheavy penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would appear that the officials of the\r\n\r\nHousing Board are insensitive to the requirements and\r\n\r\nwishes  of the residents of the flats, although  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  administering the flats for more  than  a\r\n\r\ndecade.  May I, therefore, request the Housing  Board\r\n\r\nto  take  a  closer look at its rules and regulations\r\n\r\nand  consult  the  residents through  the  residents'\r\n\r\nassociation or other organisations and work out  more\r\n\r\npragmatic schemes not only in respect of car\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparking  but also in other matters. This  will  be  a\r\n\r\nmore   democratic  approach  instead  of  introducing\r\n\r\narbitrary rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such arbitrary rule which puzzles me is why\r\n\r\nresidents  who  are allotted car park  lots  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  park their cars for a few  hours  in  an\r\n\r\nadjoining car park when vacant, if they have a reason\r\n\r\nto  do  so. Apparently the Housing Board's rule,  for\r\n\r\nreasons best known to themselves, is that \"you  shall\r\n\r\npark  your  car in your given lot and nowhere  else\",\r\n\r\neven if there are vacant lots in adjoining car parks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard is determined to forge a regimented society,  a\r\n\r\nsociety  that  will obediently abide  by  their  many\r\n\r\narbitrary  rules and regulations, and  may  not  seek\r\n\r\nredress.  This attitude of the Housing Board  appears\r\n\r\nto stem from their monopoly in public housing. As the\r\n\r\nbiggest landlord, they appear to be succumbing to the\r\n\r\nthirst  for  power by dictating the rules instead  of\r\n\r\narriving at mutually acceptable rules and regulations\r\n\r\nthat  will  equally provide discipline necessary  for\r\n\r\nthe efficient management of housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to seek clarification from the\r\n\r\nMinister  as to the reason for abolishing  the  half-hour parking in Housing Board estates at a rate of 20\r\n\r\ncents  and substituting it with a minimum fee  of  40\r\n\r\ncents  in the hour. This new rate means that  anybody\r\n\r\nwho parks his car there even for a short while has to\r\n\r\npay  the  minimum rate of 40 cents for a  full  hour.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be an arbitrary decision without  any\r\n\r\njustification  whatsoever. It excites suspicion  that\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  Board  merely wishes  to  increase  its\r\n\r\nrevenue.  In most cases people stop by at  these  car\r\n\r\nparks  for  a  few  minutes only to  speak  to  their\r\n\r\nfriends or to have a quick meal at the restaurant, or\r\n\r\nto  make some purchases at the supermarket there.  So\r\n\r\nalthough they may be there only for 15 to 20 minutes,\r\n\r\nthey now have to pay the minimum fee of 40 cents.  In\r\n\r\nthe past it was 20 cents for half an hour, and it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to understand the reason for the increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Housing Board is really honest in its\r\n\r\ndeclared intention to encourage greater intermingling\r\n\r\nand  interaction among the residents of the different\r\n\r\nHousing Board estates, these arbitrary rules do  pose\r\n\r\na  serious  problem because in the  not  too  distant\r\n\r\nfuture more than half of Singapore's population  will\r\n\r\nbe  living in Housing Board flats.

F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much\r\n\r\nhas   already   been  said  about  the  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board and my first thought was,  perhaps,\r\n\r\nsufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one point I would like especially\r\n\r\nto  make  and that relates to the Tanjong Rhu housing\r\n\r\nestate, and I hope this will not be considered  as  a\r\n\r\nparticular  or  special  pleading.  The  Tanjong  Rhu\r\n\r\nhousing  estate was constructed in 1962,  quite  soon\r\n\r\nafter  the HDB replaced the old Singapore Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust. The flats raised at Tanjong Rhu were, in fact,\r\n\r\nsometimes  described as \"emergency  flats\"  aimed  at\r\n\r\nmaking  up for the backlog of people that had  to  be\r\n\r\nhoused  urgently  at  that  time  and  at  resettling\r\n\r\ndisplaced families. Quite a lot of fire victims  from\r\n\r\nGeylang and Crawford were moved there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time the quality of HDB accommodation\r\n\r\nhas improved tremendously. When I compare the Tanjong\r\n\r\nRhu estate with the new estates like Marine Parade in\r\n\r\nthe  next  door  constituency - in  fact,  with  your\r\n\r\nconstituency of Joo Chiat, Mr Speaker, or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  Ulu Pandan, or Bedok and soon - I am struck  by\r\n\r\nthe comparative shortage of amenities that we have in\r\n\r\nTanjong Rhu. Tanjong Rhu estate may well be unique in\r\n\r\nthe   spartan  considerations  that  went  into   its\r\n\r\nconstruction. On this basis I think consideration  of\r\n\r\npriority  ought  to  be  given  to  this  estate  for\r\n\r\nwhatever improvement that may be planned, and I think\r\n\r\nTanjong  Rhu estate deserves a special look  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it could have a community hall of\r\n\r\nwhich some other estates have several. Could we  have\r\n\r\nthis  early? Could the lay-out and appearance of  the\r\n\r\nmarket/hawker  centre be improved, and its  potential\r\n\r\nfor   service   to  the  community  extended?   Could\r\n\r\nadditional  car parking facilities be made available?\r\n\r\nMany  of  the tenants are living in extremely crowded\r\n\r\ncircu  mstances;  perhaps if the  Minister  makes  an\r\n\r\nexamination of Tanjong Rhu estate, he might find  the\r\n\r\nhighest  number  of people with very  large  families\r\n\r\nliving  there. Could consideration be given as  early\r\n\r\nas   possible  to  rehousing  those  people  in  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very reluctant to want to receive special\r\n\r\nconsideration,   but   I  think   the   history   and\r\n\r\ncircumstances of Tanjong Rhu estate may well  warrant\r\n\r\nsome special attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the other points that have been\r\n\r\nraised, especially relations between Housing Board\r\n\r\nofficials and the people living in housing estates -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> You have a swimming pool there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I will come to the swimming pool a\r\n\r\nlittle later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think every effort should be made to emphasise a\r\n\r\nspirit  of  cooperation  and  understanding  of   the\r\n\r\nproblems of one side with the other.

Together with\r\n\r\na  few other Members, he has raised some observations\r\n\r\non the need to improve the standard of workmanship in\r\n\r\npublic  housing.  As a result of their  observations,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of National Development issued a  press\r\n\r\nstatement on 21st February, 1976, explaining in great\r\n\r\ndetail  the causes of the poor workmanship. I have  a\r\n\r\ncopy  of the statement here which could be handed  to\r\n\r\nthe Member at a later stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> I have read it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> I am glad the Member has read it.\r\n\r\nThe second point which he raised is whether the Board\r\n\r\ncould  refund the proportion of the unused fee for  a\r\n\r\nseason   parking  licence  taken  by   one   of   his\r\n\r\nconstituents. The Board cannot make such a refund  to\r\n\r\na  resident who has already been allocated a  parking\r\n\r\nlot.  This  means  that  he had  been  successful  in\r\n\r\nballoting  for  a parking lot and had  thus  deprived\r\n\r\nanother  person of that particular parking  lot.  The\r\n\r\nsame principle applies to a person who pays road  tax\r\n\r\nto  the  Registry of Vehicles. If he decides to  sell\r\n\r\nhis  car, he cannot ask the ROV for a refund  of  tax\r\n\r\nfor  the unexpired period. It is between him and  the\r\n\r\npurchaser.  The  same  principle  applies  to  a   TV\r\n\r\nlicence. But, to satisfy the Member, should  the  car\r\n\r\nowner deregister his car immediately, that means,  he\r\n\r\nreally  takes it off the road, then the  Board  would\r\n\r\nallow  a  refund  of  the  unexpired  season  parking\r\n\r\ncharges, to keep in line with Government's policy  of\r\n\r\ndiscouraging  car  ownership.  In  respect  of   this\r\n\r\nparticular  car.  I have checked with  the  ROV  this\r\n\r\nmorning   and   I  found  that  it   has   not   been\r\n\r\nderegistered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point raised by the Member is about the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  being  a stickler  of  principles  in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  processing of  plans  for  community\r\n\r\ncentres.  Let me reply by simply saying that whenever\r\n\r\nthe People's Association decides to build a community\r\n\r\ncentre in a Housing Board estate it forwards its plan\r\n\r\nto  the  Ministry of Finance for endorsement. In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime  the  Housing  Board  goes  ahead  with  the\r\n\r\nprocessing  of  the plan. At this  point  it  is  the\r\n\r\nnormal practice for the Housing Board to request  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association to pay for the piece of land  as\r\n\r\nsoon as it can. In fact, a six-month extension period\r\n\r\nis  normally given. It should be borne in  mind  that\r\n\r\nwhatever  the  Housing  Board  charges  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation, the price of the land is kept  extremely\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question raised was in regard to helping\r\n\r\nthe  tenants and the contractors. As he has correctly\r\n\r\npointed  out, contractors are licensed by the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard.    But   if   complaints   about   them    are\r\n\r\nsubstantiated,  then  the  Housing   Board   can   do\r\n\r\nsomething;  perhaps their licence could be terminated\r\n\r\nand  their deposit of $5,000 forfeited. They can also\r\n\r\nbe   black-listed  and  debarred   from   doing   any\r\n\r\nrenovation work in any Housing Board estate. I  think\r\n\r\nI  have  covered all the queries raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Telok Blangah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has raised a number of\r\n\r\npoints.  The first was about the provision of  better\r\n\r\nmaintenance  services for residents of Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflats. I think it is well understood that the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard   is  continuously  striving  to  improve   the\r\n\r\nstandard  of maintenance and services in its  housing\r\n\r\nestates.  A good example is the introduction  of  the\r\n\r\nEssential  Maintenance  Service  Unit  and  the  Lift\r\n\r\nEmergency   Unit   which  provide  a  round-the-clock\r\n\r\nservice  to attend to urgent calls for correction  of\r\n\r\nany defective electrical installation or to attend to\r\n\r\ncomplaints  of normal choking of sanitary  pipes  and\r\n\r\nfittings. The present charges for these services  are\r\n\r\nwell  below actual cost and, in fact they have to  be\r\n\r\nsubsidised. To give some figures, the expected income\r\n\r\nfrom the collection of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice  charges  is estimated to  be  $52.8  million\r\n\r\nagainst  an expenditure of $58.4 million. My Minister\r\n\r\nhas  indicated yesterday that for the next  financial\r\n\r\nyear  the Government will subsidise the Housing Board\r\n\r\nto  the tune of $46 million. Part of this money  will\r\n\r\nbe  used  to  subsidise the maintenance and  services\r\n\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point raised by him is on the Survey. It\r\n\r\nis   only  fair  that  I  should  g  ye  the   actual\r\n\r\ninterpretation of the Survey by those who wrote  this\r\n\r\nparticular  article. It has been  indicated  that  in\r\n\r\n1968  a  large percentage of the residents were  from\r\n\r\nresettlement  cases cleared from  the  slums  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral   area.  Therefore,  75.2%  of   the   people\r\n\r\ninterviewed  have  indicated  that  it  is  obviously\r\n\r\ncleaner  to  live  in housing estates  compared  with\r\n\r\ntheir  previous environment. However, in  1973  there\r\n\r\nwere  fewer clearance cases and some of the residents\r\n\r\nhad  moved from the older housing estates to the  new\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  as  a result of  the  splitting  of\r\n\r\nfamilies,  etc. Therefore, only 49.2% of  the  people\r\n\r\nconsider that their new environment is an improvement\r\n\r\nover the old housing estate environment. However,  in\r\n\r\nthe 1973 survey only 9.6% of the people consider that\r\n\r\ncleanliness in the Housing Board estates is  inferior\r\n\r\nto  their previous environment. Therefore, it  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  interpreted that the cleanliness in  the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard estaies has deteriorated in the last few years.\r\n\r\nthink cleanliness depends both upon the residents and\r\n\r\nthe  maintenance and service team of the HDB. If  the\r\n\r\nresidents  do  not adopt clean habits, no  amount  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance  by the HDB can really keep  the  estates\r\n\r\nspick and span.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point raised is the suggestion that perhaps\r\n\r\na  top civil servant should be appointed Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe Housing and Development Board. The present system\r\n\r\nof appointing a part-time Chairman to the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Board  has  proved  to   be   extremely\r\n\r\nsatisfactory. The intention of appointing a  Chairman\r\n\r\nor members to sit on a statutory board is to reap the\r\n\r\nrichness  of the expertise of top executives  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate   sector.   Obviously,   the   intention   of\r\n\r\nestablishing a statutory board is to ensure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   it   has   more  flexibility  and   that   the\r\n\r\nadministration    could   function    smoothly    and\r\n\r\nefficiently  and not be bogged down by too  much  red\r\n\r\ntape  and bureaucracy, as in the case of a department\r\n\r\nof the Government, like the Land Office or the P\\ND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point on which the Member has expressed\r\n\r\nconcern is in regard to the coordination and planning\r\n\r\nof  new estates. It is not fair to compare the  older\r\n\r\nestates  with  the newer estates. I  can  assure  the\r\n\r\nMember  that  the very fact that Ang Mo Kio  will  be\r\n\r\nvastly different from, say, the old Alexandra Estate,\r\n\r\nmust clearly indicate that the HDB has been receptive\r\n\r\nof  ideas  and observation from the Backbenchers  and\r\n\r\nthe  public  in improving both the design and  social\r\n\r\namenities  in the new housing estates. I  can  assure\r\n\r\nthe Member that this is so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his particular complaint about Toa Payoh Police\r\n\r\nStation, according to the Housing Board's record, the\r\n\r\npiece  of land was reserved for a police station  for\r\n\r\nthe  last  three  to  five  years.  But  somehow  the\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  the Ministry of Home Affairs  did  not\r\n\r\nmeet with this requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member touched on the public tender\r\n\r\nsystem.  I  can  only refer again  to  my  Minister's\r\n\r\nstatement  made  in  this House yesterday  afternoon,\r\n\r\nwhen  he said that the existing public tender  system\r\n\r\nhas proved to be satisfactory and there is really no'\r\n\r\nreason to change what has already been proven to be a\r\n\r\ngood system. Moreover, a fixed price system does  not\r\n\r\nensure that consumer products will be cheaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member that there is a\r\n\r\nconstant  review of the administration and policy  of\r\n\r\nthe Housing Board in conjunction with the Ministry of\r\n\r\nNational   Development,  with  the  main  object   of\r\n\r\nimproving both the concept of public housing in terms\r\n\r\nof design and the administration of public housing in\r\n\r\nterms of running these housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has raised a number of\r\n\r\npoints. First of all, let me tell him why there is  a\r\n\r\nneed  to  charge  for use of the  Housing  Board  car\r\n\r\nparks.  The  object  of  paid parking  is  merely  to\r\n\r\ncontrol car parking either\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  public  housing estates or on the main roads.  It\r\n\r\nalso ensures that there is proper use made of the car\r\n\r\nparks.   If  there  is  no  control  of  car   parks,\r\n\r\ninconsiderate car owners can easily cause obstruction\r\n\r\nand  create problems for other car owners. Therefore,\r\n\r\na paid parking system will eradicate this problem. It\r\n\r\nwill  also  prevent any encroachment by  lorries  and\r\n\r\ntrailers  and  also  stop  junk-yard  operators  from\r\n\r\ndumping  their  vehicles in the car parks  meant  for\r\n\r\nresidents of the housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be aware that the HDB has very\r\n\r\nrecently  (I  think  it was last week)  introduced  a\r\n\r\npilot  scheme  whereby parking lots are reserved  for\r\n\r\nvisitors to park their vehicles in the HDB car  parks\r\n\r\nafter  11.00p.m. To give some details,  visitors  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  pay  $1  for a  permit  to  park  their\r\n\r\nvehicles  from 11.00 p.m, at night to  7.00  am,  the\r\n\r\nnext  morning. This scheme has been implemented as  a\r\n\r\npilot  project  and it is being carried  out  at  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh   West,  Toa  Payoh  Central,  Stirling   Road,\r\n\r\nHenderson  and Buona Vista housing estates.  If  this\r\n\r\nscheme  proves to be successful, the Board may extend\r\n\r\nit to other areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has complained about the\r\n\r\nunreasonableness  on  the  part  of  the   car   park\r\n\r\nattendants  in  not  permitting visitors  to  housing\r\n\r\nestates  to  stop  just to pick  up  a  passenger,  a\r\n\r\nfriend,  or  a baggage. The Housing Board now  issues\r\n\r\npink  tickets for such vehicles to enable the  driver\r\n\r\nto  park  for a duration of five minutes without  any\r\n\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked why has the minimum parking fee\r\n\r\nbeen increased from 20 cents per hour to 40 cents per\r\n\r\nhour,  and why is there the need to restrict  parking\r\n\r\nup  to  10.00  p.m, or 11 .00 p.m, for visitors.  The\r\n\r\nanswer is that it is mainly due to the administrative\r\n\r\nproblem of shift work. For example, we cannot  change\r\n\r\nshifts  at  midnight. Members should  grant  us  that\r\n\r\nlittle     administrative    ability.    Owing     to\r\n\r\nadministrative difficulties there are certain ways to\r\n\r\ngo  about  exercising restraints. To illustrate  that\r\n\r\nthis is an administrative decision, the charge in the\r\n\r\nminimum  fee of 20 cents for half an hour parking  is\r\n\r\nslowly being withdrawn from the public car parks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder URA. There are administrative difficulties. Let\r\n\r\nme assure him that it is not an honest mistake. It is\r\n\r\na  deliberate  and  well-thought  out  administrative\r\n\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me answer the Member for Katong. He has\r\n\r\nsadly  lamented on the old estate at Tanjong Rhu.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  fact  that the Tanjong Rhu housing estate  was\r\n\r\nbuilt  under  the first five-year building  programme\r\n\r\nwhen  the  standard of public housing  was  obviously\r\n\r\namong the lowest. Because of numerous complaints  and\r\n\r\nso on, attempts have been made to improve. Again, due\r\n\r\nto  the  restricted site and the lack  of  additional\r\n\r\nspace around to expand, there is very little the  HDB\r\n\r\ncould  do. But despite that, we will try our best  to\r\n\r\nmake  some improvement to the hawker centre that  the\r\n\r\nMember  mentioned,  but  it could  only  be  a  minor\r\n\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we have sacrificed green areas in this\r\n\r\nestate  to make way for more car parks. To compensate\r\n\r\nfor  this  lack of facilities or social amenities  in\r\n\r\nthe  old  housing  estates, not  necessarily  in  the\r\n\r\nMember's  constituency  alone, the  Board   is   now\r\n\r\nsystematically  studying the various housing  estates\r\n\r\nto  provide additional facilities, wherever possible,\r\n\r\nwithin  each  estate if land is available.  Based  on\r\n\r\nthis  particular policy, a swimming complex,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember  has mentioned, has been built off Mountbatten\r\n\r\nRoad, but correctly pointed out by him, it is  meant\r\n\r\nnot  only  for the residents of Tanjong Rhu but  also\r\n\r\nfor the residents in the Old Kallang Airport Estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> And also for the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> The Board is now\r\n\r\nbuilding  another swimming pool, south of  MacPherson\r\n\r\nEstate,  for  the  residents in  MacPherson.

Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I am aware of the reply\r\n\r\ngiven  by  the  Housing Board on the  26th  February,\r\n\r\nwhich the Minister of State has referred to. The fact\r\n\r\nis  that the Housing Board was preparing a reply  to,\r\n\r\nperhaps.  \"my  last  outburst\" as  they  call  it  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of shoddy Housing Board flats. If  they  had\r\n\r\nstudied  the  speech  I made last  time,  they  would\r\n\r\nrealise that I had pointed out all the problems  that\r\n\r\nthey  now have. And if the Minister of State had only\r\n\r\nlistened  to me yesterday, he would also know  of  my\r\n\r\nappreciation  of  the pressure the Housing  Board  is\r\n\r\nundergoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know how many more flats it has to build. What I\r\n\r\nam  asking  for is that the Housing Board  should  be\r\n\r\nmore  vigilant  in its supervision  of  the  work  of\r\n\r\ncontractors.  In its reply of the 26th February,  the\r\n\r\nBoard  said, \"More than 90% of the house  owners  did\r\n\r\nthe  floors.\" In other words, it is saying that since\r\n\r\neverybody is redoing the floors, why make the  floors\r\n\r\nsuitable?  They are redoing the floors  because  they\r\n\r\nare bad. It is not because they want to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the other point about the refund of car\r\n\r\npark  charges, I do nbt know what the Minister  meant\r\n\r\nby   ``immediate  deregistration\"  because  immediate\r\n\r\nderegistration could be effected within  a  month,  a\r\n\r\nweek  or even the next day. I am not too sure whether\r\n\r\nthis particular car has been deregistered or not, but\r\n\r\nI know that it has been taken away from Telok Blangah\r\n\r\nestate.  This  is a special case. In the  history  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, when has the Government imposed a tax  and\r\n\r\nthen  withdrew it? In the case of the latest increase\r\n\r\nin  road  taxes, there was a withdrawal and,  arising\r\n\r\nout of this, the man decided to deregister his car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was very happy to hear that the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  officers  will  look   into   the\r\n\r\ncomplaints of residents about contractors who do  not\r\n\r\nhonocr  their  obligations in respect  of  renovation\r\n\r\nwork.  I  only hope that the Minister will  pass  the\r\n\r\nword down to his officers. What I know is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  if any complaint is made to the Housing  Board,\r\n\r\nthey  say,  \"Look,  this  is  a  private  arrangement\r\n\r\nbetween  you  and the contractor.\" This has  been  so\r\n\r\nthus  far.  As  from today, if the HDB officers  look\r\n\r\ninto it, I think the point has been made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other matter that I am quite happy about\r\n\r\nis   that  from  now  onwards  perhaps  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  can  make application  to  the  Building\r\n\r\nControl Division for approval of the construction  of\r\n\r\ncommunity centres six months before getting the money\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister for Finance who is not here  nnw.\r\n\r\nSometimes  the Minister for Finance takes  more  than\r\n\r\nsix months to approve payment in respect of the land.\r\n\r\nI  said that if the Housing and Development Board  as\r\n\r\nlandowner can sign the plans of the community centres\r\n\r\neven  before  receiving payment, then  I  think  that\r\n\r\ncommunity centres can be built at a faster pace  than\r\n\r\nthey are being built now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr N.

At the outset, I think  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary for me to place on record that  when  I\r\n\r\nsuggested that the Government should have more direct\r\n\r\ncontrol   and  to  that  extent  we  should  consider\r\n\r\nappointing   senior  Government  servants   to   take\r\n\r\ncontrol,  it  was not my intention to  discredit  the\r\n\r\ncontribution  made  by  past chairmen.  I  think  the\r\n\r\npresent  Hon.  Minister for National Development  and\r\n\r\nCommunications was largely responsible  for  breaking\r\n\r\nthe  back  of the very acute shortage of  housing.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve he was decorated for this and I would like to\r\n\r\nplace  that  on record. It was not the  intention  to\r\n\r\ndiscredit past achievements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the other points. The Minister of\r\n\r\nState  quoted some rather impressive figures  to  try\r\n\r\nand convince us that the housing costs are reasonable\r\n\r\nbecause they are being subsidised. First of all, why\r\n\r\nare they subsidised? Could it be that it is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing  run efficiently? The very substantial  figures\r\n\r\nquoted'  by him show a turnover of $1 10 million  per\r\n\r\nannum,  that is, $52 million revenue and $58  million\r\n\r\nexpenditure making a total turnover of $110  million,\r\n\r\ndo support my point that much greater emphasis should\r\n\r\nbe laid on the maintenance aspect and not just simply\r\n\r\nto development. That was my point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to another point, I did express some doubts\r\n\r\nabout  how reliable statistics are as they depend  on\r\n\r\nthe  assumptions one makes. But the Minister of State\r\n\r\nhas made some assumptions now, and I am beginning  to\r\n\r\nquestion his assumptions here. He stated that by 1973\r\n\r\nonly 49.2% of the people felt that the change had not\r\n\r\nbeen  for  the better, and it was on account  of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that they had moved from older estates  to  new\r\n\r\nestates.  I  would have thought .that there  was  the\r\n\r\nconstant emphasis on qualitative improvements. Surely\r\n\r\nsecond   generation  flats  are  better  than   first\r\n\r\ngeneration  flats.  So  by his  own  figures,  he  is\r\n\r\nsuggesting that the second generation flats  are  not\r\n\r\nbetter  than the first generation flats. It is worse,\r\n\r\nin fact!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of coordination, there is a little\r\n\r\nbit  of  passing the buck as regards Toa Payoh Police\r\n\r\nStation. How about Jalan Kayu? It is a new estate.  I\r\n\r\ntalked about the traffic situation and the impact  on\r\n\r\nthe   traffic  situation,  but  that  obviously   was\r\n\r\noverlooked. Jalan Kayu housing estate is a new estate\r\n\r\nand not an old estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I would like to assure the\r\n\r\nHon.  Member for Telok Blangah as far as his  request\r\n\r\nfor  an  assurance on those two points are concerned.\r\n\r\nBut  to  be fair to the press release issued  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development - I have it right in\r\n\r\nfront  of  me  -  he  mentioned  that  there  was  no\r\n\r\nsubstantive suggestions given to his observation. Let\r\n\r\nme simply quote something positive:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In cooperation with the Public Utilities Board, the\r\n\r\nsanitary pipings are now tested before the flats  are\r\n\r\nballotted and any leakage is made good before handing\r\n\r\nover the flats to the residents.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  fact,  there is another paragraph  right  at  the\r\n\r\nbottom which also answers his query. As I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid,  if he is satisfied generally, we will stop  at\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the deregistration of that particular\r\n\r\nvehicle,  the simple reason why I know  about  it  is\r\n\r\nthat   the  Member  had  written  to  me  about  this\r\n\r\nparticular  car, a Volkswagen, which came  up  during\r\n\r\nhis  meet-the-people session. All I am saying is that\r\n\r\nif he can produce the deregistration certificate from\r\n\r\nthe  ROV, I can assure him that the parking fee  will\r\n\r\nbe  immediately refunded for whatever period that has\r\n\r\nnot expired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to the Member for Jalan Kayu, all I\r\n\r\ncan  say is that our public housing is at the  moment\r\n\r\nthe  cheapest form of housing accommodation available\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. I think it is because of  the  subsidy\r\n\r\nthat  land is assessed at way below the normal market\r\n\r\nprice,  and I do not intend to query or quarrel  over\r\n\r\nthe figures because they were supplied to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the qualitative aspect, I think that\r\n\r\nwhere the statistics and the survey are concerned, it\r\n\r\nmerely   points  to  cleanliness.  That   means   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of the estate as a whole is comparatively\r\n\r\ncleaner. I do not think .- I may be wrong - that the\r\n\r\nqualitative aspect, improvements of social  amenities\r\n\r\nand  so on, is taken into consideration.

(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Dr Chiang Hai Ding and Mr Chin Harn Tong.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to add some points to what\r\n\r\nmany Members have already brought up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in recent years, in its efforts to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  increasing  demand  for  housing  for  our\r\n\r\ncitizens, the HDB has to a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreat  extent eased the grave shortage of housing  in\r\n\r\nour  Republic. And in the course of doing so, it  has\r\n\r\nhelped  to shape the new skyline of our island state.\r\n\r\nThese  glorious achievements of the HDB have won  for\r\n\r\nour  country  international acclaim in  many  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although my humble comments here in this\r\n\r\nHouse will not in any way cause any weight to fall on\r\n\r\nthe  performance of the HDB, I would like to draw the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the authorities concerned  to  certain\r\n\r\nproblems  which  are  the  end-result  of  the  rapid\r\n\r\nresettlement of our citizens in HDB flats. This  mass\r\n\r\nresettlement  has  created a  series  of  new  socio-economic problems in our society which, if allowed to\r\n\r\ngo on unchecked, may produce adverse repercussions on\r\n\r\nour way of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first problem is the oft-repeated complaint\r\n\r\nabout  quarrels between neighbours over  trivialities\r\n\r\nsuch as noise nuisances or of wash-drippings from the\r\n\r\nupper floors, and insecurity of lifts. I believe  all\r\n\r\nthis  is due to a lack of self-discipline and  civic-mindedness of the residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is no suitable open area for large\r\n\r\nsocial  gatherings such as a wedding  function  or  a\r\n\r\nreligious ceremony. At the moment such functions  are\r\n\r\nbeing  organised  in HDB car parks,  for  which  high\r\n\r\ncharges  have  to  be paid. Alternatively,  temporary\r\n\r\nwooden  structures are erected at the  roadside,  but\r\n\r\nthese  often  obstruct the free flow of  traffic  and\r\n\r\ncause   congestion.  Still  other  alternatives   are\r\n\r\navailable, but they too cause great inconvenience, as\r\n\r\nmentioned by the Member for Bras Basah just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly. HDB shop tenants are facing a lot of\r\n\r\nhardship,  and so do the many hawker stallholders  in\r\n\r\nHDB market centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these problems which I have packed at random\r\n\r\nneed  to  be thoroughly studied in relation to  other\r\n\r\nproblems, and effective solutions must be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, if I may venture to offer two humble\r\n\r\nsuggestions to the authorities for serious\r\n\r\nconsideration, I believe they could, in the least,\r\n\r\ncontribute to an improved relationship between\r\n\r\nresidents who live cheek by jowl of one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to establish a Special Duties Unit, headed\r\n\r\nby a Public Relations Officer, to promote good\r\n\r\nneighbourliness and to handle\r\n\r\nany problems such as those I have mentioned. This\r\n\r\nUnit should also be entrusted with a certain amount\r\n\r\nof autonomous authority to dispel the hidden fear\r\n\r\namong officials of retaliation or victimisation,\r\n\r\nhence rectifying the cause of malpractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we know that Citizens Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittees and Management Committees of Community\r\n\r\nCentres have rendered invaluable service to the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board to deal with the\r\n\r\nproblems of residents which occur every now and then.\r\n\r\nHowever, members of CCC and CCMC, who are not\r\n\r\nappointed by the HDB and therefore do not have direct\r\n\r\nrelations with the HDB, have nothing to do with them.\r\n\r\nThey feel that they can only render service to the\r\n\r\nHDB if they are so requested. In the circumstances,\r\n\r\ntherefore, I support the view, just mentioned by the\r\n\r\nMember for Bras Basah, that now is the right time to\r\n\r\nconsider the feasibility of setting up Residents'\r\n\r\nRepresentatives Committee under the supervision of\r\n\r\nthe Special Duties Unit in the various constituencies\r\n\r\nwhich have got HDB flats so as to assist the HDB in\r\n\r\ntackling problems of residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe HDB was chaired by our capable Minister in the\r\n\r\nearly 1 96Os and we are fortunate that today it is\r\n\r\nstill under the charge of the same Minister, who by\r\n\r\nthis time would be more knowledgeable and more\r\n\r\nexperienced. His contribution to the task of nation-building is immeasurable. And together with the\r\n\r\nSenior Minister of State who himself is a man of\r\n\r\nreputable talent and calibre, there is no doubt at\r\n\r\nall that these socio-economic problems in these\r\n\r\nhousing estates will be solved with ease and that the\r\n\r\nHDB will continue to further develop and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachieve  greater success. But, Sir, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow  whether the Minister and his Minister of  State\r\n\r\nshare  my  views  on the problems  in  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\ntouring  my  constituency  on  several  occasions   I\r\n\r\nvisited  a  few blocks of one-room HDB flats,  and  I\r\n\r\nmust say that I was rather taken aback by what I have\r\n\r\nseen.  To be fair to the HDB, the blocks of  flats  I\r\n\r\nvisited are the old types. On each floor two rows  of\r\n\r\nflats share a common corridor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first unpleasant impression I received on\r\n\r\nsetting foot on each floor is that of entering into a\r\n\r\ndark  tunnel. It may well be that each corridor would\r\n\r\nbe  well-lit at night. But as it was day-time and the\r\n\r\nlights  were switched off, it took a bit of time  for\r\n\r\nme and my friends, having stepped in from the sun, to\r\n\r\nadjust  ourselves  to  the gloomy  condition  of  the\r\n\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously the corridor was not so dark because\r\n\r\neach  flat  had an opening near the top of  the  wall\r\n\r\nlining  the  corridor. Because of such  openings  the\r\n\r\ncorridor  was  quite  bright. Moreover,  the  opening\r\n\r\nallows air to circulate more freely in each flat  and\r\n\r\nserves to ventilate the corridor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was given to understand that these apertures were\r\n\r\nbricked-up to contain any possible outbreak  of  fire\r\n\r\nin  any  of  the  one-room flats sharing  the  common\r\n\r\ncorridor.  If  it  is so, I would like  to  know  how\r\n\r\nfrequent  does fire break out in such one-room  flats\r\n\r\nas  to  justify the bricking-up of such openings.  My\r\n\r\nconcern  is  that the flats were originally  designed\r\n\r\nwith  such openings to facilitate the ventilation  of\r\n\r\nthe flats and the corridor as well as to brighten  up\r\n\r\nthe  corridor during daytime. As it is, the  existing\r\n\r\nenvironmental  conditions of the occupants  of  these\r\n\r\none-room  flats,  which must have been  the  greatest\r\n\r\ndensity  of  occupants  per room  in  Singapore, are\r\n\r\nmiserable  enough without being further  worsened  by\r\n\r\nthe adoption of such measures as to the sealing up of\r\n\r\nventilation apertures. I hope that the HDB  can  look\r\n\r\ninto  the  matter  and  find an  alternate  means  of\r\n\r\ncontaining  any  possible outbreak  of  fire  without\r\n\r\nresorting to the drastic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpedience of bricking-up ventilation openings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Sir, if I may be permitted to join the\r\n\r\ndebate  at this juncture. The subject raised  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Aljunied is very close to my heart because\r\n\r\nthere are 19 one-room blocks in Leng Kee constituency\r\n\r\nwhose  ventilation openings have just been closed  up\r\n\r\nby  the HDB. I was told by the HDB Area Office in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency that apart from fire hazards  there  are\r\n\r\ntwo  other  reasons which prompted HDB  to  implement\r\n\r\nthis.  The  first is to prevent mischievous  elements\r\n\r\nfrom throwing things into the flat. The second is  to\r\n\r\nkeep away peeping Toms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree to all the reasons put forward, but one\r\n\r\nmust  also  realise that the moment these ventilation\r\n\r\nopenings  are closed up, then whatever little  cross-ventilation  that  might have  existed  before  would\r\n\r\nautomatically  be lost. I did suggest  to  the  Board\r\n\r\ntowards  the end of last year whether it was possible\r\n\r\nto  consider replacing the glass sheet which was used\r\n\r\nto close the opening above the door to each flat by a\r\n\r\nset of glass louvres. Sir, all of us know that if the\r\n\r\nIouvres are adjusted to a correct angle of slope they\r\n\r\nwill  certainly  make  it more  difficult  for  those\r\n\r\nmischievous elements to throw things inside.  As  far\r\n\r\nas  peeping Toms are concerned, if they still  insist\r\n\r\non  peeping,  then  with a proper adjustment  of  the\r\n\r\nIouvres, what they could see will be only the ceiling\r\n\r\nand  not what is going on at the floor level. I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  of State will care to comment  on  the\r\n\r\ncost-effectiveness of the proposal I have  suggested.\r\n\r\nIf  he  says  that the glass louvres are  not  to  be\r\n\r\nfitted because of fire hazards, perhaps he would care\r\n\r\nto  comment  on why Iouvres are more fire-prone  than\r\n\r\nglass sheets which they have now introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I was elated to hear the\r\n\r\nMinister  mention  yesterday that  priority  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to a transfer from a one-room flat to a three-room  flat, so that there will be better environment,\r\n\r\nmore space, and so on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  so forth.

At\r\n\r\npresent  private commercial banks accept  payment  of\r\n\r\nPUB bills from the people, including HDB tenants.

I understand, and I stand  to\r\n\r\nbe  corrected, that junior employees of  the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board such as maintenance inspectors\r\n\r\nand the hawker liaison officers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\netc, are not given any training at all prior to their\r\n\r\npostings. These young employees of the Board are  raw\r\n\r\nand  inexperienced.  They are  simply  recruited  and\r\n\r\nposted straightaway to their jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this state of affairs is rather undesirable\r\n\r\nbecause  the  nature of their work brings  them  into\r\n\r\ncontact with the public frequently. My suggestion for\r\n\r\nthe  consideration of the Minister is that we  should\r\n\r\nget  these  young  officers to undergo  an  induction\r\n\r\ncourse  so as to provide them with some understanding\r\n\r\nof  human  relationship. There are lots of complaints\r\n\r\nabout  the  way these young officers go  about  their\r\n\r\nduties.  They  are inconsiderate, rude and  at  times\r\n\r\naggressive.  Something must be  done,  otherwise  the\r\n\r\ngood  image of the Government may be ruined by  these\r\n\r\nyoung  officers. Sir, you may agree that it is almost\r\n\r\na  threat  that the HDB is fast becoming a government\r\n\r\nwithin the government. Unless something is done then,\r\n\r\nas  I  say,  the  image may be ruined.  So  the  best\r\n\r\nsolution  is  to  let  them go through  an  induction\r\n\r\ncourse. If this is done, they will be more polite and\r\n\r\nwe  can  still maintain the good image that  we  have\r\n\r\ncreated.  I hope these matters will be given  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould just like to make two points. One concerns  the\r\n\r\nquestion of one-room HDB flats. I have asked in  this\r\n\r\nChamber  before as to the possibility of the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  considering,  at  some  time  in  the  future,\r\n\r\npulling  down these units completely and then rebuild\r\n\r\nnew  ones  in their place. I was given the  assurance\r\n\r\nthat it would consider so. Till then, it would appear\r\n\r\nto  me that the people living in these one-room flats\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to live in these dark  tunnels  minus\r\n\r\nventilation,  and  hopefully minus peeping  Toms  and\r\n\r\nother nuisances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed appalling that in our visits to\r\n\r\nthe  one-room  flats  we  do frequently  come  across\r\n\r\nsomething like eight, 10, 15 or more people  live  in\r\n\r\nthem.  I can certainly name one instance where  there\r\n\r\nwere about 23 people crowding in a one-room HDB flat.\r\n\r\nThis is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfact.  They  were  living  on  different  layers   of\r\n\r\nstructure  put  up  within that  one  room.  This  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  an  exceptional case. I have  quoted  this\r\n\r\ncase  in  order to draw the attention of the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard that conditions in these one-room flats can  be\r\n\r\nappalling  and  if  these people  have  asked  for  a\r\n\r\ntransfer, they should be given priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the second point which has been\r\n\r\nraised by two of my colleagues, and that is, priority\r\n\r\nfor  a  transfer - whether transfer to a bigger  unit\r\n\r\nshould  be  given to a family of four, i.e, father,\r\n\r\nmother  and  two  children, or to  one  of  10, i.e.\r\n\r\nparents plus eight children. I understand that it  is\r\n\r\nour  Government's  policy to encourage  small  family\r\n\r\nunits  but we must recognise the fact that the family\r\n\r\nplanning   policy  was  instituted  only   of   late.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  people  whose  established  families  are\r\n\r\nlarge cannot be blamed for actions for which in  many\r\n\r\ninstances they are not entirely to be blamed  or  are\r\n\r\nresponsible for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of this argument, let me say this. From our\r\n\r\nown experience with our constituents through the meet-the-people  sessions,  we have come  across  numerous\r\n\r\ninstances  where small family units have applied  for\r\n\r\ntransfer.  Although they were following  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy, yet they were told by officers of the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board that \"because your family unit\r\n\r\nis  too small, seven and less, you do not qualify for\r\n\r\ntransfer.\" I am very confused and I should  certainly\r\n\r\nappreciate  the  Minister  giving  us  some   logical\r\n\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my\r\n\r\nMinister,  I  want  to  thank  the  Hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nHenderson  for  his  very kind compliments.  But  the\r\n\r\nanswer to most of his queries will be \"No\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has correctly pointed out that the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  of noise nuisance, the washdrippings  and\r\n\r\nvandalism  of  lifts  and so  on  are  definitely  an\r\n\r\nindication of a lack of civic responsibility  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  residents. In that direction there is  very\r\n\r\nlittle the administration of the HDB can do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is a valid observation that there is\r\n\r\nthis  lack of a big community hall for functions, like\r\n\r\nweddings  and so on, to be carried out. But  one  must\r\n\r\nbear   in  mind  that  while  we  are  improving   the\r\n\r\nfacilities  in the newer estates, as I have  indicated\r\n\r\nearlier, there must be priorities. Everybody is asking\r\n\r\nfor  facilities,  such as sports  fields  and  playing\r\n\r\nfields.  It  is  now suggested that we should  have  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  hall for social activities. With  a  little\r\n\r\nbit  of  initiative, perhaps renting  a  hall  at  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centre or some school hall could make-do for\r\n\r\nthe sort of function that the Member has in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is need for a little clarification\r\n\r\nhere.  When my Minister mentioned that there  was  90%\r\n\r\nsuccess,  he  was  referring to shops  on  the  public\r\n\r\ntender  system, and there was no implication  of  such\r\n\r\nsuccess with hawker centres in housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the Member's query on the setting up of a\r\n\r\nspecial  unit  to  promote social activities.  I  have\r\n\r\nalready stated earlier on that the answer is \"no\", The\r\n\r\nreason is this. Members may be aware that the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Home Affairs is already looking into a proposal for\r\n\r\nthe   setting  up  of  a  Block  Committee  comprising\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen and volunteers from  amongst  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public, including members of the  CCCs\r\n\r\nand  MCs  if  they  are available, to  assist  in  the\r\n\r\nprevention  of crime, vandalism and other  anti-social\r\n\r\nactivities  in Housing Board estates. It is  therefore\r\n\r\npremature  for  the  Housing  Board  to  consider  the\r\n\r\nproposal  for  another special unit. I  would  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  we  wait for the performance of this  particular\r\n\r\nunit  which  is being set up by the Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs,  and if the need should arise we  can  always\r\n\r\nreconsider his request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied is a bit disappointed with\r\n\r\nthe  dark  corridors  in  the housing  estate  in  his\r\n\r\nconstituency.  As  I  have earlier  pointed  out,  the\r\n\r\nTanjong  Rhu housing estate and the housing estate  in\r\n\r\nhis constituency belong to the older generation of one-room  flats.  I  think the only way to  convince  Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers is that, if one goes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  one-room  improved type  of  flats  at  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah, one can definitely see an improvement in  the\r\n\r\ndesign, lighting, and so on. The main reason has  been\r\n\r\nenunciated  by  both the Member for  Aljunied  and  my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Member for Leng Kee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no actual cost-effectiveness of glass louvres\r\n\r\nversus simple glass versus weld-mesh openings.  But  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  can be said that Iouvres are more expensive\r\n\r\nIf  he  is  interested.  I will  give  him  a  reading\r\n\r\ntomorrow  on  cost-effectiveness. I think the  several\r\n\r\nincidents of fire that had occurred in these  one-room\r\n\r\nflats  have prompted the HDB to initiate this  action.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  HDB  is  aware that substituting  concrete\r\n\r\nblocks   for   these   weld-meshed  openings   reduces\r\n\r\nventilation, it  is  a necessary  precaution  against\r\n\r\nspread of fire in these congested one-room flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we should await a serious occurrence\r\n\r\nof fire for this to be tested. But to satisfy Members,\r\n\r\nwe  have  done an informal inquiry into the  situation\r\n\r\nafter  a few Members of Parliament have complained  to\r\n\r\nthe officers of the Area Offices. We have got a survey\r\n\r\nwhich  shows  that approximately 70% of the  openings,\r\n\r\nthat   means   the   previous  weld-meshed   openings.\r\n\r\ncompletely closed. In addition, some 25% to  30%  were\r\n\r\npartially closed prior to this decision to close  them\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give some figures. In Toa Payoh East, it was\r\n\r\nfound  that  70%  or these openings  were  closed.  In\r\n\r\nHenderson,  70%  were  totally  closed  and  25%  were\r\n\r\npartially  closed. In Balestier. 70%  were  completely\r\n\r\nclosed  and 30% partially closed, which means  a  100%\r\n\r\ncoverage  by  the  survey. I  think  the  question  of\r\n\r\nprivacy and the nuisance of having things thrown  into\r\n\r\none's  flat is uppermost in the minds of the residents\r\n\r\nas far as they are concerned. But from the HDB's point\r\n\r\nof view, what is most important is that these openings\r\n\r\nare definitely a fire hazard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to double check the reliability of these\r\n\r\nstatistics,  the HDB will select a block  of  one-room\r\n\r\nflats  due  to  be completed soon and  provide  larger\r\n\r\nopenings  along the walls fronting the access corridor\r\n\r\nto test the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nventilation, and to observe its effectiveness  during\r\n\r\nthe next 12 to 18 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has correctly pointed out\r\n\r\nthe  need  of  a  good public image  for  our  public\r\n\r\nhousing  programme. I think we share  his  sentiments\r\n\r\nand, in fact, this is precisely what we are trying to\r\n\r\ndo.  I  would like to inform him that the Board  does\r\n\r\nconduct periodically training courses for all  grades\r\n\r\nof  officers when they first join the Board  or  some\r\n\r\ntime  after  joining the Board. Such courses  include\r\n\r\nHDB orientation programme, and for those involved  in\r\n\r\nfinance    there    are    courses    on    financial\r\n\r\nadministration,   management   report   writing   for\r\n\r\nexecutives,  training  within  industry,   and   also\r\n\r\ncourses   on   job   relations,  job   methods,   job\r\n\r\ninstruction,  courtesy  to the  public,  handling  of\r\n\r\npublic requests and how to serve the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all other organisations. HDB officers are\r\n\r\ninstructed  to be courteous and polite to members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public. But being such a large organisation with\r\n\r\nnearly  10,000 employees, it is therefore  inevitable\r\n\r\nthat  complaints are made against some employees from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time.  But  in  all  cases  of  complaints,\r\n\r\ninvestigations are thoroughly carried  out.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to assure all Hon. Members that if they have any\r\n\r\nspecific  complaint about any particular  officer  in\r\n\r\nany  particular area, please let me know and we  will\r\n\r\ninvestigate into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to answer the contradiction implied by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Potong Pasir and the Member for Kim  Seng\r\n\r\non the two-child family concept versus a large family\r\n\r\nof seven to 10 children. Let me first merely say that\r\n\r\nif the observation of the Member for Kim Seng is that\r\n\r\nthere  are  23  occupants in one room, then  I  think\r\n\r\nprobably most of them are illegal immigrants. As  far\r\n\r\nas   administrative  implementation  of  transfer  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,   where  I  am  directly  responsible   as\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the Allocations Committee,  discretions\r\n\r\nare  exercised  between, say, a  seven-member  family\r\n\r\nversus  a  family of father, mother and two children.\r\n\r\nIn  all  cases  of transfer special consideration  is\r\n\r\ngiven  to the human aspect. For example, in a  family\r\n\r\nof   seven   where  one  member  of  the  family   is\r\n\r\nunfortunately not in a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  condition,  then  I  think  we  will  have   no\r\n\r\nhesitation  in  giving preference to that  particular\r\n\r\nfamily.  On the other hand, for example, if a  family\r\n\r\nof father, mother and two children wants to apply for\r\n\r\na  five-room flat, when we feel that they  should  be\r\n\r\nquite  contented  with a two-room flat,  then  unless\r\n\r\nthere is urgent reason for somebody else to have  it,\r\n\r\nwe  have  no hesitation in giving preference to  this\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a transfer registration involved. In\r\n\r\nother  words, we have to take into consideration  the\r\n\r\nlength  of time he has been on the waiting list.  Let\r\n\r\nme   assure   Hon.  Members  that  while   there   is\r\n\r\ncontradiction, seemingly so, the  administration  of\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of transfer preferences  is  done\r\n\r\nafter taking all factors into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to answer the Member for Kim Seng. In the\r\n\r\ncase  of Tiong Bahru, if I am not mistaken, the  one-room  emergency flats have been knocked down  and  in\r\n\r\ntheir   place  one-room  improved  flats  have   been\r\n\r\nerected.  But  here again, the priority of  providing\r\n\r\nmore  new  HDB  flats  is  uppermost  in  our  minds,\r\n\r\nTherefore,  priorities come into  play.  But  let  me\r\n\r\nassure  him  that wherever there is an  urgent  need,\r\n\r\nthere will be no hesitation in knocking down the very\r\n\r\nold  one-room emergency units with common  corridors,\r\n\r\nand  common facilities and building the new  improved\r\n\r\none-room units,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, am Ito understand\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister of State is willing to go  against\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy to consider preference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Did he say that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> He did say that he would give\r\n\r\nconsideration.

The answer is no. The reason is very obvious.\r\n\r\nIn most housing estates we do provide facilities like\r\n\r\nthe Post Office Savings Bank. In some of the estates,\r\n\r\nlike  Queenstown,  there  are  also  sub-branches  of\r\n\r\nbanks.  Since they are providing all the  facilities,\r\n\r\ntheme is no justification in further loading the Area\r\n\r\nOffice by granting that request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Member for Potong Pasir could at least\r\n\r\nappreciate the difficulties of the administrators  in\r\n\r\nimplementing  certain policies. The  Member  for  Kim\r\n\r\nSeng has already indicated that the policy of the two-child family concept was enunciated sometime in  1972\r\n\r\nor  1973. Frankly, in those cases where there are  10\r\n\r\nchildren in a family, it is totally not applicable.

No\r\n\r\nlife  was lost. In fact, there was a little look  of,\r\n\r\nshall  I say, happiness among them because they  were\r\n\r\ngoing  to be housed in beautiful Housing Board  flats\r\n\r\nnearby.  However, a constituent in that area came  to\r\n\r\nme  showing more frustration than the others who were\r\n\r\ndirectly affected by the fire because his hut was not\r\n\r\ngutted.

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Hwang Soo Jin.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resettlement is very unpleasant, and the task of\r\n\r\nresettlement is also unpleasant. Nobody likes  to  be\r\n\r\nresettled from where they have been staying for many,\r\n\r\nmany  years, with the exception of perhaps  the  slum\r\n\r\ndwellers  in  Moulmein.  Few  officers  like  to   be\r\n\r\nResettlement  Officers  or  even  to  work   in   the\r\n\r\nResettlement  Department. By and  large,  the  people\r\n\r\nwith  whom these Resettlement Officers have to  deal,\r\n\r\nare   antagonistic  and  feel  that  they  have  been\r\n\r\naggrieved. It is, therefore, very essential that  the\r\n\r\nofficers  working  in  this department  are  properly\r\n\r\norientated  and have the right attitude  to  do  this\r\n\r\nunpleasant work. In their dealings with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople who are affected by resettlement, they must be\r\n\r\ntactful and polite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When resettlement of a locality is decided, the\r\n\r\nofficers of the Department will first go to the  area\r\n\r\nto  make a survey and take a census of the residents.\r\n\r\nThe  affected  residents are  concerned  about  their\r\n\r\nfuture   and   make  enquiries  from   the   officers\r\n\r\nconducting the survey. If, at this initial stage, the\r\n\r\nofficers  explain the reasons and the plans that  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  has  for resettling the residents, then.\r\n\r\nnot  only will their job be made easier, but it  will\r\n\r\nalso  reduce friction that invariably arises. In many\r\n\r\ninstances, even  the Member of  Parliament  for  the\r\n\r\nconstituency  in  which a census is being  taken  for\r\n\r\nresettlement purposes is not aware until  a  hue  and\r\n\r\ncry  is  made  by the residents. Officers  from  this\r\n\r\nDepartment  have  been  known to  tell  the  affected\r\n\r\nresidents  that they are going to be  chased  out  in\r\n\r\nthree  months' time. When asked where they were going\r\n\r\nto  be resettled, they were told. \"Find out from  the\r\n\r\noffice\"  or  \"Go  and see your MP\"  when  the  MP  is\r\n\r\ncompletely in the dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to do this unpleasant task is not easy. It can\r\n\r\nbe  made  easier  if  the officers  are,  as  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier,  properly orientated towards their work  and\r\n\r\nthe Member of Parliament is taken into confidence and\r\n\r\ninformed  of the nature of resettlement and the  need\r\n\r\nfor such resettlement before conducting a survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also desirable that the period between taking\r\n\r\na  census and the resettlement is not dragged on  and\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is here that the Member for Moulmein has\r\n\r\nmade  his point.

I recall bringing to the attention\r\n\r\nof the House the fact that MPs were not kept informed\r\n\r\nof  imminent resettlement affecting their  particular\r\n\r\nconstituencies. This is a point which has  been  made\r\n\r\nby  the  Member  for Telok Blangah. Whilst  the  then\r\n\r\nMinister  did promise that all MP5 affected would  in\r\n\r\nfuture  be  informed in advance, I regret  to  report\r\n\r\nthat the situation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  not really improved. It is difficult for  me  to\r\n\r\ndraw  any conclusion beyond saying that words  spoken\r\n\r\nby Hon. Ministers in this House are perhaps not taken\r\n\r\nthat   seriously  by  the  civil  servants!   Thanks,\r\n\r\nhowever, to the present Senior Minister of State  who\r\n\r\nhas  crossed over from this side of the House  fairly\r\n\r\nrecently  and is perhaps, therefore, better  able  to\r\n\r\nappreciate the plights of Backbenchers, and I hope he\r\n\r\nwill remain that way; some of my difficulties in  the\r\n\r\npast  year have been made a little easier as a result\r\n\r\nof  assistance  extended by him from  time  to  time.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Sir, from a procedural point of view  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  it is such a good idea that  Minister  or\r\n\r\nMinister of State should be unduly burdened with work\r\n\r\nresulting   from   the  day  to  day   administrative\r\n\r\ninadequacy  or  inefficiency. These anomalies  should\r\n\r\nmore  properly  be  resolved by introducing  suitable\r\n\r\nprocedures,   Admittedly.   Sir,   the   Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment has done well in moving people,  otherwise\r\n\r\nwe  would not have half of Singapore staying  in  HDB\r\n\r\nflats today. But I do wonder, judging by the way they\r\n\r\ngo  about  chasing  out people, as mentioned  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Telok  Blangah, whether  they  have  not\r\n\r\nbecome insensitive to human feelings or sufferings or\r\n\r\nperhaps  they  are taking for granted extremely  good\r\n\r\ncooperation   we  have  from  the  people   in   this\r\n\r\nparticular regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Jalan Kayu is one constituency which is\r\n\r\nfortunately   or  unfortunately  catching   up   with\r\n\r\nprogress,  which  means the presence of  resettlement\r\n\r\nofficers  during  the  last 12  months.  For  several\r\n\r\nmonths  now, at my regular meet-the-people  sessions,\r\n\r\nan   increasing  number  of  cases  of   resettlement\r\n\r\nproblems have been referred to me. In the majority of\r\n\r\nsuch  cases  it is quite clear to me that  inadequate\r\n\r\nexplanations  or guidance have been  given  to  these\r\n\r\npeople,   particularly  on  the  question  of   their\r\n\r\neligibility   for   alternative  accommodation.   The\r\n\r\nslightest  ambiguity or inconsistency  found  on  the\r\n\r\nidentity cards of affected family members immediately\r\n\r\ndisqualify them from alternative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhousing.  In  the  majority  of  such  cases  if  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  concerned  can be  bothered  to  spend  a\r\n\r\nlittle  time it should not be too difficult for  them\r\n\r\nto  find  out  the correct answer as to  whether  the\r\n\r\npeople  are eligible or not eligible. The only advice\r\n\r\nthe Department appears to be able to give in all such\r\n\r\ncases  is  that the families concerned  must  produce\r\n\r\ndocumentary  proof, without indicating what  type  of\r\n\r\ndocuments will be considered as acceptable proof.  In\r\n\r\ndesperation many people spent time and money to  take\r\n\r\nout  statutory declarations, only to be  rejected  as\r\n\r\nsoon as they are submitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In resettlement there is such thing as cutoff\r\n\r\ndates,  which is the date decided by the Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  determine a person's eligibility  for\r\n\r\nalternative  housing. If he moves into  the  affected\r\n\r\narea  prior to the cut-off date, he will be  eligible\r\n\r\nfor  alternative housing; on the other  hand,  if  he\r\n\r\nmoves  into the area after the cut-off date, he  will\r\n\r\nnot  be given alternative housing. How and when  this\r\n\r\ndate  is  fixed for a particular affected area  often\r\n\r\npuzzles me. And not only the public, but even MPs are\r\n\r\nnot  kept  informed of the cut-off date  in  advance.\r\n\r\nThis  has resulted in a number of instances of people\r\n\r\nunknowingly moving into an affected area  and,  after\r\n\r\npaying tea money and incurring expenses to move  into\r\n\r\ntheir new homes, only to find that they have to start\r\n\r\nhouse-hunting again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apparent insensitivities of the Department are\r\n\r\nbest  illustrated  by  the  fact  that  some  of  the\r\n\r\naffected families were asked to move out even  during\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  New Year period. Until a complaint  was\r\n\r\nlodged  by me and very kindly taken up by the  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister of State, the Department was in the habit of\r\n\r\nsummoning  affected  families  to  appear  in   court\r\n\r\npresumably  to psychologically intimidate  them  into\r\n\r\nmoving. Sir, this sort of strong-arm tactic is, to my\r\n\r\nmind,  quite unnecessary as by now our citizens  have\r\n\r\ncome to accept the fact that if Singapore is to go on\r\n\r\nprogressing  they must cooperate. For Jalan  Kayu.  I\r\n\r\ncan  assure  you,  Sir, out of  several  hundreds  of\r\n\r\naffected   families  there  was  only  one   isolated\r\n\r\ninstance of an old lady who came to tell me that she\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndid  not  wish  to move but subsequently,  I  gather.\r\n\r\nbetter  sense  prevailed  and  she  moved  out   like\r\n\r\neverybody else. Sir, as pointed out by the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah earlier, it is a traumatic  experience\r\n\r\nfor  people who have lived in a particular place  all\r\n\r\ntheir lives to wake up one morning to find that  they\r\n\r\nhave  to move out. When they are suffering the mental\r\n\r\nanguish and making all the necessary preparations  to\r\n\r\nmove to a new and strange environment, the very least\r\n\r\nthe Department can do is to be sympathetic and not to\r\n\r\nfurther  aggravate their difficulties.  From  what  I\r\n\r\nhave  seen  and heard of the work of the Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment, I am not satisfied that they  have  taken\r\n\r\nthis into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now. Sir, to the question of exgratia\r\n\r\ncompensation for licensees of State lands, there  are\r\n\r\nalso  many inexplicable and what appear to me  to  be\r\n\r\nunfair practices. Indeed many examples were quoted by\r\n\r\nHon.  Members  yesterday. For  instance,  people  are\r\n\r\noften  asked to vacate without being told  the  exact\r\n\r\nquantum  of  compensation.  For  those  involved   in\r\n\r\nfarming,   according  to  the  announced  policy   of\r\n\r\nGovernment,  they  will  receive  compensation  at  a\r\n\r\nhigher  rate. However, the assessment appears  to  be\r\n\r\ndone  somewhat  arbitrarily. Once the Department  has\r\n\r\ndecided  that a person is not a so-called  bona  fide\r\n\r\nfarmer,  there are no means by which the  person  may\r\n\r\nappeal.  I  did take up a few cases on behalf  of  my\r\n\r\nconstituents, but sad to say, the answer in all cases\r\n\r\nwas  in  the negative. Until yesterday when the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister and Senior Minister of State enlightened the\r\n\r\nHouse, everybody was in the dark as to the definition\r\n\r\nof  a  \"bona  fide farmer\". Consequently. Sir,  there\r\n\r\nhave   been  no  guidelines  to  work  on  for  those\r\n\r\ndissatisfied parties intending to appeal. Now we  are\r\n\r\ntold  a  bona fide farmer is one who keeps  not  less\r\n\r\nthan 3.000 head of poultry or 100 pigs. Sir, from the\r\n\r\npoint  of considering the eligibility for alternative\r\n\r\nfarm land, the criteria adopted may be acceptable but\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think the same set of criteria should  be\r\n\r\napplied to compensation. There are many small  timers\r\n\r\nwho  keep less than 3,000 head of poultry or 100 pigs\r\n\r\nbut  they  are  nevertheless  genuine  farmers  fully\r\n\r\ndependent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  farming as a livelihood. There are many more  who\r\n\r\nmay  be  partially dependent but without  the  income\r\n\r\nfrom  farming  to  supplement their family  earnings,\r\n\r\ntheir livelihood can become precarious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel strongly, Sir, from the point of compensation\r\n\r\nthat a separate set of criteria should be worked out.\r\n\r\nThe  extent  of dependence rather than  the  size  of\r\n\r\noperation  should  be  a  more  equitable  basis  for\r\n\r\nawarding compensation. Is it not possible to  have  a\r\n\r\nsliding   scale  of  compensation  so  that   persons\r\n\r\npartially   dependent   will   nevertheless   receive\r\n\r\ncompensation  at  the enhanced rate proportionate  to\r\n\r\nthe percentage of their dependence on farming?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hwang, your time is up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I am about to finish.

However, today, after  a\r\n\r\nlapse  of one or two years, they are still without  a\r\n\r\nshop  and so they are suffering unnecessary hardship.\r\n\r\nIf  there is some truth in their allegation.

Similarly, the  URA,  the  HDB  itself,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Communications, etc, No reason is  given\r\n\r\nexcept  that  that particular area has been  gazetted\r\n\r\nfor  acquisition as the land is required for a public\r\n\r\npurpose.  This  means that the resettlement  officers\r\n\r\nthemselves  do  not know what kind of development  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to take place in that particular area.  So  do\r\n\r\nnot  blame them if they honestly say that they really\r\n\r\ndo  not know. If any Hon. Member should feel strongly\r\n\r\nthat  they  have to know what the area will  be  used\r\n\r\nfor, then the best thing is for him to find out which\r\n\r\nparticular  Ministry or statutory body  is  acquiring\r\n\r\nthat area and inquire directly from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff of the Resettlement Department, as\r\n\r\nindicated   by  the  Hon.  Member,  faces  tremendous\r\n\r\nproblems.  Nevertheless, they are told to be  patient\r\n\r\nand  courteous  towards the public at all  times.  We\r\n\r\nhave  heard in the House that it takes both sides  to\r\n\r\nexercise  good relationship. Some people who  receive\r\n\r\nresettlement  notices  adopt  a  resentful  and  even\r\n\r\nhostile attitude towards resettlement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficers, and that is admitted. But I believe, by and\r\n\r\nlarge,   working   in  such  a  stressing   situation\r\n\r\nresettlement officers generally have performed  their\r\n\r\nduties reasonably well. But nevertheless I can assure\r\n\r\nall Hon. Members here that if they have complaints of\r\n\r\nrudeness  or  are unhappy over certain activities  of\r\n\r\nthese  officers,  then do let  us  know  so  that  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation can be carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah queried about the need\r\n\r\nto  conduct  a census survey, His suggestion  that  a\r\n\r\ncensus survey on resettlement cases be conducted only\r\n\r\nwhen  alternative accommodation is available  is  not\r\n\r\npractical.  Census  survey of resettlement  squatters\r\n\r\nhas  to commence in advance because the magnitude  of\r\n\r\nthe problem has first to be ascertained and provision\r\n\r\nmade   for  alternative  accommodation.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nsufficient time is required to examine the squatters'\r\n\r\neligibility,  to  process the  improvement  on  their\r\n\r\nland,  to compute the quantum of compensation payable\r\n\r\nand to comply with all the legal formalities such  as\r\n\r\nserving notices to quit, etc,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has I think brought up a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  points. First, let me deal directly  with\r\n\r\nhis  query on the cut-off date. The main object of  a\r\n\r\ncut-off  date  is  obviously to prevent  unscrupulous\r\n\r\nowrers  of buildings or structures on State  land  or\r\n\r\nHDB  land  due  for clearance from  selling  them  to\r\n\r\nunsuspecting  persons at perhaps  exorbitant  prices.\r\n\r\nThis  also  prevents some members of the public  from\r\n\r\ncashing  in  for priority of HDB flats by paying  out\r\n\r\ntea  money to owners of structures os~ these acquired\r\n\r\nsites.  The  Board has actually issued several  press\r\n\r\nstatements informing the general public of what these\r\n\r\nrulings  are.  The  date of Gazette  notification  is\r\n\r\ntaken  as the cut-off date for eligibility in respect\r\n\r\nof  private land compulsorily acquired by Government.\r\n\r\nIn  respect of State or HDB land, the cut-off date is\r\n\r\nthe first day of taking of census by the Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained just now why it is not always\r\n\r\npossible  for the Resettlement Department  to  inform\r\n\r\nMembers   of  Parliament  in  advance.  As  I   said,\r\n\r\nsometimes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresettlement officers themselves do not know the nature  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Sometimes  it  is  necessary   to   keep   it\r\n\r\nconfidential where the position of the land is uncertain. I\r\n\r\nhope  Members  can  appreciate  the  point.  However,   the\r\n\r\nDepartment  has  made  it a rule to inform  the  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament  of  the respective constituency  in  which  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  site  is  located of any  impending  resettlement\r\n\r\naction  before the field staff are sent out  to  conduct  a\r\n\r\ncensus  survey. I think those rural Members  of  Parliament\r\n\r\ncan  vouch  that  they are informed and  that  we  do  send\r\n\r\nofficers to help during the period of difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last change of residential address on the identity\r\n\r\ncard  before  the cut-off date will be taken as  conclusive\r\n\r\nevidence   of   the  displaced  person's  eligibility   for\r\n\r\nresettlement  benefits. However, in  borderline  cases  the\r\n\r\nResettlement   Department  has  accepted   other   official\r\n\r\ndocuments such as TOL, income tax returns, birth  or  death\r\n\r\ncertificate, vaccination or inoculation certificate,  radio\r\n\r\nor  TV  licence, driving licence, or any other evidence  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  physical occupation of the site before the cut-off\r\n\r\ndate. However, arising from such complaints of Members, the\r\n\r\nResettlement Department is now drawing up a list of what we\r\n\r\ncall  \"official  documents\" which can be  accepted  by  the\r\n\r\nResettlement Department as evidence of residence. In future\r\n\r\nthis  list will be attached to the clearance notices served\r\n\r\non all displaced persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next query the Member mentioned is about the ex-gratia compensation payable to people affected by the\r\n\r\nvarious land acquisition or development projects. The rates\r\n\r\nwere  last reviewed in 1975 and the revised rates were made\r\n\r\nknown to the general public through the mass media. At this\r\n\r\njuncture  it  is  worthwhile to clear the  misunderstanding\r\n\r\nover  the  definition of bona fide farmers yesterday.  This\r\n\r\narose from a query by the Member for Punggol when he talked\r\n\r\nabout  land  allocation and the criterion of  100  pigs  or\r\n\r\n3.000  head  of poultry. To clear, once and for  all,  this\r\n\r\nimplication that there are no criteria and that the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department arbitrarily decides who  is  a  bona\r\n\r\nfide farmer and who is not. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshall give Members all the criteria used so that there will\r\n\r\nnot  be  any future queries as to what is this and what  is\r\n\r\nthat, if they can put up with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into that, let me say that the bona fide\r\n\r\nstatus of a displaced farmer is determined by the staff  of\r\n\r\nthe  Resettlement Department on certain guidelines provided\r\n\r\nby  the  PPD.  As the current resettlement policy  provides\r\n\r\nenhanced   resettlement  benefits  for  displaced  farmers,\r\n\r\nincluding   higher   rates   of   ex-gratia   payment    of\r\n\r\ncompensation, payment of a cash grant or a free  three-room\r\n\r\nflat  in  lieu  of land allocation, all cases  have  to  be\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the  Department  of  Primary  Production  for\r\n\r\nexamination and verification. There is a panel  chaired  by\r\n\r\nthe  Director  of  Primary Production to review  all  these\r\n\r\ncases.  In  fact, if any particular squatter or settler  is\r\n\r\nunhappy  over  any decision taken, he can  appeal  to  this\r\n\r\nPanel,  which  comes  directly  under  the  charge  of  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  PPD.  If the Panel should  rule  against  the\r\n\r\nappeal of this squatter or settler, he can take it one step\r\n\r\nfurther   by   appealing  to  the  Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  which has the final authority over  the  PPD.\r\n\r\nThe  Panel has in the past reexamined many cases of  appeal\r\n\r\nand  I  shall  later give Members very brief statistics  to\r\n\r\nshow  that  many  cases  were  settled  in  favour  of  the\r\n\r\nappellant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I think the term \"bona fide farmer\" is a\r\n\r\nmisnomer. After today's debate, it is our intention to tell\r\n\r\nthe  PPD  to  stop using the term \"bona fide farmer\".  This\r\n\r\nterm  \"bona  fide  farmer\"  has been  used  to  describe  a\r\n\r\nsituation   for   enhanced  compensation  as   resettlement\r\n\r\nbenefits.  The  present definition of a  bona  fide  farmer\r\n\r\nmeans  anybody or any farmer who is engaged in any  farming\r\n\r\nactivity  to the extent of any of the following  \"criteria\"\r\n\r\n(since there was implication that there were no criteria):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Livestock farming:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pigs 25 heads, poultry 1,000 tieads.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>Vegetable farming:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of leafy vegetables, if you have an area of 1,800 sq. ft.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cultivated area of 1,800 sq. ft. of water cress\r\n\r\nand 3,600 sq. ft. of other leafy vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Fruit farming:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 durian trees or 40 rambutan trees, or an\r\n\r\nequivalent number of similar type of fruit trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Orchid growing:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orchids and flowers cultivated over an area of 10,000 sq. ft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Fish farming:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1\ufffd acres of pond fish-breeding. Aquarium fish 7,200\r\n\r\nsq. ft. tank area. This means the surface area  of\r\n\r\nthe   fish   tank  not  the  area  of  the  farmer's\r\n\r\nparticular estate. Aquarium plants 5,000 sq. ft. of\r\n\r\ncultivated area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of queries on borderline cases.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if a farmer has only 20 pigs, we do not\r\n\r\nstraightaway eliminate his eligibility. We  will  try\r\n\r\nand  re-define  his case based on  a  combination  of\r\n\r\nfactors.  If  he  has only 20 pigs and  800  head  of\r\n\r\npoultry, we might define him as a poultry farmer.  Or\r\n\r\nif he has a combination of any of these factors, say.\r\n\r\n10 durian trees, 10 pigs and 500 head of poultry, the\r\n\r\nflexibility  of this Resettlement Panel may  rule  in\r\n\r\nhis  favour.  All the factors are spelt out  in  this\r\n\r\nlist here. In other words, the assessment of criteria\r\n\r\nfor  a  bona fide farmer is actually fairly generous.\r\n\r\nThese criteria have been effectively implemented from\r\n\r\n1971/72 and it has not been made public because  this\r\n\r\nhas   all   along  been  an  internal  administrative\r\n\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to what was discussed yesterday on the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of  alternative land  allocation  for\r\n\r\nresettlement cases. This is the point when  we  began\r\n\r\nto  talk about the bona fide of farmers, and we  said\r\n\r\nthat  a  farmer must have 100 pigs or 3,000  head  of\r\n\r\npoultry. In fact, he might be given half an  acre  of\r\n\r\nland if he farms to this extent. So it goes down  the\r\n\r\nline:  if  he  has  1,051 pigs  and  15,001  head  of\r\n\r\npoultry, he will be given two acres of land. There is\r\n\r\na  table of figures here that gives the whole  range,\r\n\r\nTherefore, the consideration of all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  cases of whether an ordinary bcna fide  farmer\r\n\r\nbelongs  to  this  category  which  is  eligible  for\r\n\r\nenhanced compensation or to another category which is\r\n\r\neligible  for  land allocation, is processed  by  the\r\n\r\nResettlement Panel chaired by the Director of Primary\r\n\r\nProduction. I have indicated to Members that they can\r\n\r\nappeal to this Panel and if they are still not  happy\r\n\r\nthey  can  go  straight to the Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members some idea of how this\r\n\r\ncompensation   is  paid.  This  had  been   discussed\r\n\r\nyesterday.  The  ex-gratia  compensation  awarded  to\r\n\r\nthese farming cases (\"farming case\" means farmers  as\r\n\r\ndefined by the Department). Those who find their  own\r\n\r\naccommodation will be paid exgratia compensation  for\r\n\r\ntheir  house  and other improvements at the  enhanced\r\n\r\nrate.  \"Enhanced rate\" means the new rate revised  on\r\n\r\n1st April, 1975. In addition to this compensation,  he\r\n\r\nis   given  a  cash  grant  of  $11,800  in  lieu  of\r\n\r\nalternative  accommodation or, if he  so  prefers,  a\r\n\r\nthree-room improved flat in a New Town is  given  for\r\n\r\nfree. For those recommended for land allocation, that\r\n\r\nmeans  those  who  qualify for land  allocation,  ex-gratia  compensation will be paid for his  house  and\r\n\r\nother  improvements but at the lesser  rate.  \"Lesser\r\n\r\nrate\" means the rate before the revision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example of what I mean by \"lesser\r\n\r\nrate\"  and \"enhanced rate\". There is a difference  of\r\n\r\napproximately 30% to 50%, Compensation  for  a  house\r\n\r\nand  a kitchen with concrete floor and drain, at  the\r\n\r\nenhanced  rate  will  be $7.50 per  sq, ft.  At  the\r\n\r\nordinary  rate,  that means he is  entitled  to  land\r\n\r\nallocation  but  is  still paid a  compensation,  the\r\n\r\ncompensation will be at the lower rate of  $4.50  per\r\n\r\nsq, ft. On top of this, those squatters who were  on\r\n\r\nthe  land  when the census was taken will be entitled\r\n\r\nto  some compensation based on the ordinary rate, and\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  given priority as far as  rental  and\r\n\r\npurchase  of  HDB  flats  are  concerned.  In   fact,\r\n\r\nfamilies affected by clearance are given priority for\r\n\r\nrehousing  in HDB flats with a rental rebate  of  $15\r\n\r\nper  month  for  a  period of three  years.  If  they\r\n\r\npurchase  a  HDB flat the downpayment is  reduced  to\r\n\r\n$100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other form of alternative accommodation given\r\n\r\nfor  those  affected  will  be  shophouses.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect  my Minister has indicated the rising  rental\r\n\r\nformula  which means that during the first  year  the\r\n\r\ntenant  pays 50% of what the commercial value is  and\r\n\r\nit  goes  up  in subsequent years to the end  of  the\r\n\r\nfifth  year, that is, on the sixth year, the  tenant\r\n\r\npays the full rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope all this has helped to clarify the doubt as\r\n\r\nto  whether  or  not one is or is  not  a  bona  fide\r\n\r\nfarmer.  The  best is to find out whether  one  is  a\r\n\r\nfarmer  or  not.  If  one  qualifies  under  all  the\r\n\r\ndefinitions that I have given Members, then one is  a\r\n\r\nfarmer.  If  one is a farmer then one is entitled  to\r\n\r\nchoose  the type of compensation: land allocation  or\r\n\r\nmonetary compensation. But whichever one chooses,  in\r\n\r\naddition  to  land allocation, one  gets  a  monetary\r\n\r\ncompensation based on either the revised higher  rate\r\n\r\nor  the  ordinary lower rate. To give  some  figures,\r\n\r\nthis  Resettlement  Panel has  since  1971  made  the\r\n\r\nfollowing decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1974, 18% or 49 cases of farmers were allocated\r\n\r\nland.  142 cases or 52% of farmers were not allocated\r\n\r\nland,  and  only  29.7% did not  qualify  as  farming\r\n\r\ncases.  The total number of cases for 1974 is 272  to\r\n\r\nmake  it  100%.  In  1975, 21% of  the  farmers  were\r\n\r\nallocated  land.  49.5%  of  the  farmers  were   not\r\n\r\nallocated  land, and there were 29.6% of non-farmers.\r\n\r\nIf  you  add up, the total number of farmers in  1974\r\n\r\nand 1975 comes within the region of almost 80%. So it\r\n\r\nis  not  true  to  say  that the  Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  uses its whims and fancies to  decide  on\r\n\r\ncases.  There  are proper procedures  and  these  are\r\n\r\nbeing   followed  and, in  fact,  there  are  proper\r\n\r\nchannels  of  assessment.  I  would  like  to  assure\r\n\r\nMembers  from the rural areas that if they want  more\r\n\r\ninformation on this I could supply them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, may I be permitted to press\r\n\r\nthe point about those who are partially dependent.

I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask  him whether a  farming  family,\r\n\r\nmoving into a HDB flat, would be able to maintain and\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  subsist  with  the  enhanced  rate   of\r\n\r\ncompensation.  In  other words, I  believe  that  the\r\n\r\nquestion of the endangerment to their livelihood  has\r\n\r\nnot been taken into account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, there has been a lot of controversy\r\n\r\nover  this question of whether a tarmer is bona  fide\r\n\r\nor  not  bona fide. My view is that the mistake  lies\r\n\r\nwith  the  Primary  Production  Department.  The  PPD\r\n\r\nissues  a farming certificate to every farmer. Later,\r\n\r\nwhen resettlement is carried out, the PPD will say to\r\n\r\nthose  affected farmers, \"You are a bona fide farmer\"\r\n\r\nor \"You are not a bona fide farmer\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to consider whether there\r\n\r\ncould  be  some restriction on the issue  of  such  a\r\n\r\nfarming  certificate.  If  they  are  not  bona  fide\r\n\r\nfarmers,  then the Department should not  issue  them\r\n\r\nwith  farming  certificates. Then when  they  produce\r\n\r\nthese certificates on resettlement we should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfollow  the  procedure laid down by the PPD  and  pay\r\n\r\nthem  compensation accordingly. Only in this way  can\r\n\r\nwe solve the problem. Otherwise, one department under\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of National Development will  issue  a\r\n\r\nlicence   to  a  person  to  carry  on  his   farming\r\n\r\nactivities  only  to be denied, on  resettlement,  by\r\n\r\nanother  department under the same  Ministry  when  a\r\n\r\ndemand for compensation is lodged, that he is  not  a\r\n\r\nbona fide farmer. To the farmers, this appears to  be\r\n\r\na  deliberate  attempt by the Government  to  extract\r\n\r\nmoney   from  them  by  manipulating  the  situation.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   this   problem  should   merit   serious\r\n\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng hang:</b> Sir, let me first answer the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Bukit Panjang. A little history  of  the\r\n\r\nlicensing of farmers will help him to understand  the\r\n\r\nsituation. In the earlier days, or even today, when a\r\n\r\nperson  applies  for a farming licence  there  is  no\r\n\r\ninsistence that he must have a minimum number of pigs\r\n\r\nor  poultry.  That means, we take it at  face  value.\r\n\r\nWhen  he  comes  to tell me that he  wants  to  be  a\r\n\r\nfarmer,  I am in no position to say whether he  is  a\r\n\r\nsmall-time  farmer  or a big-time  farmer.  One  only\r\n\r\nassumes that he is engaged in farming activities.  He\r\n\r\nmay  have  a  farming licence but he does no  farming\r\n\r\nactivity at all. That is his privilege. We issue  him\r\n\r\nwith a farming licence on the presumption that he  is\r\n\r\ngoing into farming. Many of them have probably folded\r\n\r\nup, but they still call themselves farmers. So there\r\n\r\nis  no  correlation between possession of  a  farming\r\n\r\nlicence  and  a bona fide farmer that I have  defined\r\n\r\njust now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to take his suggestion that\r\n\r\nperhaps what we should do is before issuing a licence\r\n\r\nto  any  person we say. \"To get this farming licence.\r\n\r\nyou must have a minimum number of so many pigs and so\r\n\r\nmany  head  of  poultry\".  I  will  get  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department to look into this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the query from the Member for Jurong on\r\n\r\nnotices  to quit, I hope it is appreciated that  this\r\n\r\nis  definitely  not done to threaten the  farmers.  I\r\n\r\nhave explained very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquickly just now to the Member for Jalan Kayu that it\r\n\r\nis a legal requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I think the Member for\r\n\r\nJurong  was  referring to the summons  to  appear  in\r\n\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, let me first explain why\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  need  to  issue this  notice.  We  have\r\n\r\ninitiated an arrangement whereby if a person does not\r\n\r\nwant  to go to court, he signs a warranty to say that\r\n\r\nhe  is  giving  up the piece of land. This  is  being\r\n\r\nimplemented,  and I think the Member for  Jalan  Kayu\r\n\r\ncan  vouch that this is being done. If there  is  any\r\n\r\ndifficulty in that direction, I will be very happy to\r\n\r\nhelp out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to the Members for Jalan Kayu and\r\n\r\nPunggol.  I  have indicated that there is  a  set  of\r\n\r\ncriteria -. 25 pigs and 1.000 head of poultry, and so\r\n\r\non. I have also indicated that in borderline cases  a\r\n\r\ncombination  of  factors is used to help  define  the\r\n\r\nposition  of  a  particular farmer. But  again,  like\r\n\r\nanything  else,  when discretions are exercised,  the\r\n\r\ncomputation  must be within reason.  For  example,  a\r\n\r\nperson  may  depend  on two pigs  and  10  layers  to\r\n\r\nsupplement  his  income by selling the  eggs  to  his\r\n\r\nneighbours,  but  the  Primary Production  Department\r\n\r\ncannot  take that into consideration. So I am  trying\r\n\r\nto  impress  upon Members that there  are  limits  to\r\n\r\nexercising discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already given Members the other two\r\n\r\nextremes.  If  a  person  keeps  23  pigs  and   some\r\n\r\nchickens, we  may say that he is  a  farmer.  But  a\r\n\r\nperson  who keeps four pigs and 20 chickens, we  say\r\n\r\nthat   that  is  incidental;  it  is  not  a  farming\r\n\r\nactivity.  But we do not penalise him. We still  give\r\n\r\nhim  compensation and priority for a three-room flat.\r\n\r\nMy  Minister  has also indicated yesterday  that  two\r\n\r\nrural  centres  will  be  set  up  in  the  midst  of\r\n\r\nintensive  pig  farming activi:ies. If  a  person  is\r\n\r\ndeprived  of a livelihood, he can always  get  a  job\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  a fact that labour  for  farming  is\r\n\r\nextremely hard to get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is only fair that I answer the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang  who  has queried some  activities  of\r\n\r\nresettlement  in Sembawang. The shopkeepers  affected\r\n\r\nby the widening of Sembawang Road will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffered  shop  premises in Ang Mo Kio New Town,  which  are\r\n\r\nexpected to be completed by about the middle of this  year.\r\n\r\nThe  Housing  Board  will also build a shopping  centre  at\r\n\r\nSembawang  Road. 19th Km., for the relocation  of  some  of\r\n\r\nthese   affected  shopkeepers.  This  shopping  centre   is\r\n\r\nexpected to be ready in the second quarter of 1977 and will\r\n\r\ncomprise 40 shops and five eating houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third question is: how many shops are affected? The\r\n\r\nanswer  is: 41 shops are currently affected by the widening\r\n\r\nof Sembawang Road, stretching from Sembawang Hill Circus to\r\n\r\nJalan  Sembawang  Kechil.  In the Sembawang  Road  widening\r\n\r\nscheme, of the 333 cases affected, 37 families  have  been\r\n\r\noffered  flats  at Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh New  Towns  and\r\n\r\nanother 23 families will be balloting for flats at  Ang  Mo\r\n\r\nKio at the end of this month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member for Sembawang asked whether the\r\n\r\nResettlement  Department will give priority for  allocation\r\n\r\nof HDB accommodation to squatters affected by clearance. If\r\n\r\nat  the  time  of census the squatters were there.  I  have\r\n\r\nindicated  just  now that they will be offered  alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

But that matter has already been raised in\r\n\r\nthe  discussion on the Minister's Head of Expenditure.  All\r\n\r\nthe  same,  we  might remember that last  year  during  the\r\n\r\nBudget  sitting  the Minister for National Development  did\r\n\r\nmention that he was shocked to learn of the fact that about\r\n\r\n80% of our roads would be dug up during the financial year,\r\n\r\nthat  is, the financial year that is just coming to an end.\r\n\r\nUnder   such  circumstances, obviously  the  question   of\r\n\r\ncoordination just does not seem feasible. However, we might\r\n\r\nexpress the hope now that when this large-scale development\r\n\r\nis  over, that is, the laying of utilities on such a  large\r\n\r\nscale  is completed, the committee will once more be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  coordinate road digging to  lay  down  public\r\n\r\nutilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point, there is no doubt that looking over the\r\n\r\nEstimates for the past five or six years, we find  that  an\r\n\r\nenormous amount of money and effort are being spent on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and  extension of our  road  network  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  fact, when we look  at  the  detailed\r\n\r\nstatement  of  the estimated and actual expenditures,\r\n\r\nwe  might rightfully conclude that the Roads  Section\r\n\r\nis  getting on with the job of using funds  allocated\r\n\r\nfor  this  general purpose. At the same time,  it  is\r\n\r\npossible that, looking at the Establishment position,\r\n\r\none  may  ask  whether there is such  a  shortage  of\r\n\r\nstaff,  especially  at  the technical  level,  as  to\r\n\r\naffect  the smooth accomplishment of road maintenance\r\n\r\nand development plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few possible indicators that may suggest\r\n\r\none or two problems. First, having to travel for some\r\n\r\nreason  along Mandai Road quite frequently, I  notice\r\n\r\nthat the roadwork there has taken a very long time to\r\n\r\nproceed. In fact, for a spell the metal laid down  at\r\n\r\nthe road side was overgrown with grass and shrubbery.\r\n\r\nThere may be similar instances of delay in respect of\r\n\r\nother road repair or development projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with regard to road surfaces, one notices\r\n\r\nthe   different  shades  of  mixture,   texture   and\r\n\r\nconsistency  of the mix laid on for the surfacing  or\r\n\r\nresurfacing.  This  gives  the  impression  that  the\r\n\r\nstandards in respect of the quality of road surfacing\r\n\r\nare  not  consistent. It is possible that supervision\r\n\r\nis not as effective as it should be, resulting in the\r\n\r\ncontractors getting away with shoddy work  and  other\r\n\r\nirregularities of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if I may just refer to a development\r\n\r\nproject  to  illustrate my point. When examining  the\r\n\r\nPan-Island  Express Way scheme between  Thomson  Road\r\n\r\nand Jalan Anak Bukit, one might gather the impression\r\n\r\nthat  work  could have been concentrated  on  certain\r\n\r\nsegments  and  if these segments are completed,  then\r\n\r\nthey   could  be  used  and  the  effects   of   such\r\n\r\ndevelopment   felt   and  enjoyed  immediately.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the alternative routes thus provided  could\r\n\r\nresult  in  improved traffic conditions  and  greater\r\n\r\nconvenience  to the public. But instead  one  gathers\r\n\r\nthe impression of scattered work being carried out at\r\n\r\ndifferent points of the Thomson Road/Jalan Anak Bukit\r\n\r\nproject resulting in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffort   being   diffused   and   the   effects   not\r\n\r\nconcentrated.   This  may  point   to   problems   of\r\n\r\norganisation   in  respect  of  roadwork   and   road\r\n\r\nmaintenance.   I  would  appreciate  the   Minister's\r\n\r\nresponse to these comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, SIr, the Public Works\r\n\r\nDepartment  does suffer from a shortage of  technical\r\n\r\nstaff. The Minister for Finance has indicated in  his\r\n\r\nBudget Statement that there is an excessive usage  of\r\n\r\ntechnical staff in certain Government departments. If\r\n\r\nthe  Member could persuade the Minister for  Finance,\r\n\r\nwe may perhaps be able to get the required staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's question about the Pan-Island Express Way, let me assure him that, as far as\r\n\r\nthe organisation of roadworks is concerned, a project\r\n\r\nis   first   thoroughly   examined   before   it   is\r\n\r\nimplemented, and there is a purpose in tackling  each\r\n\r\nsegment  of the roadworks separately. I can give  him\r\n\r\nthat assurance. The completed stretch of the roadwork\r\n\r\nfrom  Adam  Road  to  Jalan Anak Bukit  is  the  only\r\n\r\nsegment  of the Pan-Island Express Way which  is  not\r\n\r\nopen  to  traffic. This particular stretch  is  being\r\n\r\nconstructed in three phases. The stretch completed in\r\n\r\nPhase  I is, to use the technical term, Chainage  335\r\n\r\nmetres  from  Adam  Road  to Chainage  3,350  metres.\r\n\r\nadjacent to the Singapore Turf Club. The construction\r\n\r\nworks  under  Phases II and III are now in  progress.\r\n\r\nThese two slip roads connecting Adam Road to the Pan-Island  Express Way are under construction  and  they\r\n\r\nare  expected  to be completed by the  end  of  April\r\n\r\n1976. In order to open to traffic the segment of  the\r\n\r\nroad  constructed under Phase I, the only  connection\r\n\r\nto Dunearn Road would be through Hillcrest Road which\r\n\r\nwould not be appropriate as this would give rise to a\r\n\r\ngreat   deal   of  traffic  through  a   very   quiet\r\n\r\nresidential area. Phase II covers a stretch  of  road\r\n\r\nfrom the Singapore Turf Club to Jalan Anak Bukit  and\r\n\r\nthe  road work is due for completion in August  1976.\r\n\r\nThe  whole  stretch  of  the Pan-Island  Express  Way\r\n\r\nwould, therefore, be open to traffic in August 1976.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked why there is so much delay in the\r\n\r\ncompletion of some projects, for example, the one  in\r\n\r\nMandai Road. There are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumerous  factors affecting the early completion  of  road\r\n\r\nprojects.  They could generally be summarised as  follows.\r\n\r\nLand acquisition is one of the problems. Then there is the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  clearing the squatters,  the  laying  of  new\r\n\r\nutility  services  and the resiting of existing  services.\r\n\r\nFinally, as has been correctly observed, there are certain\r\n\r\ncontractors  who do give poor performance and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nprogress  has been slow. In the case of Mandai  Road,  the\r\n\r\nslow  progress  is  due mainly to the  difficulty  in  its\r\n\r\nconstruction work. To alleviate flooding, the new road has\r\n\r\nto be constructed at a higher level than the existing one.\r\n\r\nThe new road also overlaps part of the old road. The other\r\n\r\nfactor  is the heavy traffic especially during the morning\r\n\r\nand evening peak hours. The contracted date for completion\r\n\r\nis supposed to be 15th April, 1976. But owing to the above\r\n\r\nreasons  it  would  be delayed by a month.  Completion  is\r\n\r\nexpected in May 1976.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me briefly reply to his query with regard to the\r\n\r\nroad surfaces and the implication that work is perhaps not\r\n\r\nup  to  standard.  Resurfacing of roads is  normally  done\r\n\r\nevery  five  or six years. Whenever there is an additional\r\n\r\nsurface laid, there are different degrees of settlement. I\r\n\r\ndo  not wish to get involved in too much technical detail.\r\n\r\nI  would merely say that once a road is dug up for  laying\r\n\r\ncertain  services, the surface is affected  by  subsequent\r\n\r\nsettlement of the soil back-fill. That means, as the  road\r\n\r\nis  filled, there are different degrees of settlement  and\r\n\r\nthis  gives  rise to the different colours. The settlement\r\n\r\nmay be fresh or fresh bitumen may have been mixed with the\r\n\r\nolder  soil, and so on. These factors are fairly technical\r\n\r\nin  nature. Sometimes, owing to settlement problems  there\r\n\r\nwill  be unevenness in road surfaces. But normally, given\r\n\r\ntime  they  will  be rectified. Once the earth  below  the\r\n\r\nsurface  is allowed to settle, the PWD will resurface  the\r\n\r\nroad. That means it will keep on filling until the surface\r\n\r\ncomes up to the original level again. What I am trying  to\r\n\r\nsay  is  that this is not due to poor supervision or  poor\r\n\r\nworkmanship,  but  rather  the  nature  of  the  technical\r\n\r\nrequirement in constructing roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I am very satisfied with the answer.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd.

Pressures apply to families  living  in\r\n\r\nthese    homes,   very   centrifugal    in    nature,\r\n\r\ndisintegrating  the family, pressures  upon  children\r\n\r\nwhich  require  them to leave their  homes  pressures\r\n\r\nupon parents which require them to be absent from the\r\n\r\nhome   and, in  fact,  unwittingly  the  Board   has\r\n\r\ndeveloped   a   situation  which   assists   in   the\r\n\r\ndisintegration of the family, Sir. The Board sets  up\r\n\r\ngood  housing  estates and, at the  same  time,  good\r\n\r\nhawker centres. What is developing in these homes  by\r\n\r\nway  of  disintegrating the  family  is  a  habit  of\r\n\r\nparents  not  coming  together  in  meals.  What   is\r\n\r\nhappening is that parents are settling their lunch or\r\n\r\ndinner problem by distributing 50 cents. 80 cents  or\r\n\r\na  dollar  each  to the children in the  family,  who\r\n\r\nimmediately disperse to their favourite hawker in the\r\n\r\nhawker   centre.   There   results   immediately    a\r\n\r\ndisintegration of the family whence there could  have\r\n\r\nbeen  an  opportunity for the whole  family  unit  to\r\n\r\ncohere  in  a function of the day. This is  happening\r\n\r\nextensively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one ponders the extent to which this can go and\r\n\r\nthe  extent of the disintegration of the family  unit\r\n\r\nin  the  years to come unless something  is  done,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it is disturbing. One cannot require the Board\r\n\r\ndirectly to be involved in trying to turn flats  into\r\n\r\nhomes  because this is basically the problem  of  the\r\n\r\noccupants. If there is, in the thinking of the Board,\r\n\r\nan effort that can assist this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment  -  frankly speaking.  Sir, I  have  not\r\n\r\nstudied  as  to how to make a constructive suggestion\r\n\r\nalong  these lines - I think it is going to do  us  a\r\n\r\nlot of good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I wish to raise actually\r\n\r\nconcerns community centres in the housing estates.  I\r\n\r\nraise  this point because I feel it is necessary  for\r\n\r\nthe concept or the idea to get accepted by the Board.\r\n\r\nI   quite  understand  that  in  regard  to  building\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  in  housing  estates,  the  Board\r\n\r\nliaise very closely with the People's Association  in\r\n\r\nthis regard. I am thinking, Sir, of what may not be a\r\n\r\nperceptible loss in our populace as our families move\r\n\r\ninto  the Housing Board flats from the terrace,  semi\r\n\r\ndetached or kampong house. Something is lost  and  it\r\n\r\nis  this.  In  the terrace, semidetached  or  kampong\r\n\r\nhouse, the  youngsters in the family  have  got  the\r\n\r\nopportunity   to  experiment,  to   tinker,   to   do\r\n\r\ncarpentry,  to engage in mechanical pursuits,  either\r\n\r\nas  a  hobby  or  otherwise, in the  garden,  in  the\r\n\r\nbackyard or in the space around the house. It is this\r\n\r\ntinkering,  this experimentation, this  doing  things\r\n\r\nwhich develop a creative and innovative potential  in\r\n\r\nthe  youngsters  who become innovative  and  creative\r\n\r\nadults and workers of the future. When there is  this\r\n\r\nloss  of  opportunity to our populace by moving  into\r\n\r\nHDB  flats  where  these things  cannot  be  done  or\r\n\r\nundertaken, there is loss of this potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I think if, as a result of liaison\r\n\r\nbetween the Board and the People's Association, there\r\n\r\ncan  be accepted the concept of incorporating in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres in the housing estates  work-rooms\r\n\r\nwith  work-benches for youngsters in  the  estate  to\r\n\r\npursue  hobbies or to do things. I think  this  would\r\n\r\nretrieve to some extent the kind of loss that we  are\r\n\r\nundergoing.  It  is  the  fashion  of  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  to advise the Board what  facilities  to\r\n\r\nincorporate in the community centres, usually  it  is\r\n\r\nbasketball  court or facilities for table tennis  and\r\n\r\nmeetings.  But I do not think that this  concept  has\r\n\r\nbeen  accepted yet or has been discussed by the Board\r\n\r\nin  setting up community centres. I intend  to  raise\r\n\r\nthis again when the People's Association comes up for\r\n\r\ndiscussion under the Head. Ministry of Culture.

As regards his suggestion whether the HDB has\r\n\r\nany objection to incorporate some form of workshop  or\r\n\r\nwork  space in the community centres, the H DB has  no\r\n\r\nobjection  to this provision for whatever mec  hanical\r\n\r\nactivities  he  has  in  mind, provided  they  do  not\r\n\r\ngenerate   noise  or  cause  any  other  environmental\r\n\r\nproblems  in  the  housing estates.  But,  as  he  has\r\n\r\ncorrectly  pointed  out, I do  not  know  whether  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association will agree to incorporate  these\r\n\r\nactivities in their community centres and it  will  be\r\n\r\nup to the People's Association board to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his other general observation on the HDB\r\n\r\nmaking  homes  more homely, administratively,  on  our\r\n\r\nown,  we  are trying to provide that by giving  better\r\n\r\nhouses,  better  finishes and perhaps better  designed\r\n\r\nhousing   estates  incorporating  better  social   and\r\n\r\nrecreational  amenities.  In  fact, my  Minister  has\r\n\r\nreminded me that we have produced this magazine called\r\n\r\nHome  which  gives  an  indication  of  the  sort   of\r\n\r\nactivities which the HDB is attempting to provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me quickly switch over to the Hon.

(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon and Dr Ong Leong Boon.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago I was told that I had torn the SBS\r\n\r\nto  pieces! This year I do not intend to tear the SBS\r\n\r\nto  pieces. In fact, I wish to commend it for  having\r\n\r\ndone  something about its transport system, and I  am\r\n\r\nsure that members of the public will agree with me in\r\n\r\nsaying that improvements have been made,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is still room for further\r\n\r\nimprovement. Some services are still irregular, buses\r\n\r\nseem to reach the bus stops in threes or fours at the\r\n\r\nsame  time. Time-keepers should regulate the services\r\n\r\nmore efficiently. No doubt conductors and drivers are\r\n\r\ngenerally   polite   and   disciplined.    That    is\r\n\r\ncommendable. But I am afraid to say there  are  still\r\n\r\nsome  black sheep existing and because of these black\r\n\r\nsheep,  whatever  the  SBS  tries  to  implement   is\r\n\r\nsometimes negated. Cleanliness of buses has  also  to\r\n\r\nbe looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I wish to mention the unnecessary delays\r\n\r\ncaused  by  buses which go to their terminus  or  bus\r\n\r\ndepots   for   refuelling.  Very  often, at   these\r\n\r\nrefuelling  depots  there is a long  queue  of  buses\r\n\r\nwaiting.  Sometimes it takes as long as  1  5  to  20\r\n\r\nminutes  before a particular bus at one  end  of  the\r\n\r\nqueue  is  refuelled. Is it possible for the  SBS  to\r\n\r\norganise  the refuelling of buses in such a way  that\r\n\r\nnot  too  much  inconvenience is caused  to  the  bus\r\n\r\ncommuters, who may be fighting against time to arrive\r\n\r\nat their destinations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was speculation in the local press that\r\n\r\nbus fares are expected to be increased from a minimum\r\n\r\nof  20  cents to a flat rate of 30 cents and 50 cents\r\n\r\nOne  of  the primary purposes of amalgamation of  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies in 1970 was to reduce cost In the  past  we\r\n\r\nhad  numerous  bus  companies The first  amalgamation\r\n\r\nresulted  in reducing the number of bus companies  to\r\n\r\nfour, and a further amalgamation resulted in only one\r\n\r\nsingle bus company, the SBS It is rather strange that\r\n\r\nwith amalgamation we saw the disappearance of the  5-cent fare and then the 10-cent fare, and it looks  as\r\n\r\nif we would very soon see the disappearance of the 20\r\n\r\ncent  fare.  This is rather surprising.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  see that this does  not  take  place,\r\n\r\nbecause  the people are already grumbling  about  the\r\n\r\nrecent ro,3d tax increases, and now even the fare for\r\n\r\nthe  cheapest form of transport is also to be raised,\r\n\r\non the excuse of increased over-head cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, don't tell me that SBS is not making a profit.\r\n\r\nBut  perhaps  profit is not the motive  for  the  SBS\r\n\r\neither expanding or putting in additional capital for\r\n\r\nwhich  it has to charge higher fares. Is it  fair  to\r\n\r\ncharge higher fares if additional capital is required\r\n\r\nfor the renewal of buses? Naturally, a certain amount\r\n\r\nof  loss is inevitable but this loss can be recovered\r\n\r\nvery  quickly by careful and proper planning  If  the\r\n\r\nSBS  is  perfect,  we do not have to  supplement  its\r\n\r\nservice  with Scheme El buses In fact, the  Scheme  B\r\n\r\nbuses  which  were supposed to be a temporary  affair\r\n\r\nseems  to  become  a permanent picture  on  Singapore\r\n\r\nroads. I wonder how much longer we have to depend  on\r\n\r\nthese Scheme B buses for an efficient bus service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shuttle service was also introduced to run between\r\n\r\nthe  fringe car parks to the CBD zone. But this is  a\r\n\r\nfailure.  In fact, we see the shuttle service  taking\r\n\r\naway part of the burden of SBS. It looks as if we are\r\n\r\ngoing  back  to square one again where different  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies were operating. So when is the SBS going to\r\n\r\nbecome a really efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreliable and a prompt public transport company?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that recently the bus company\r\n\r\nissued  bus guides costing 50 cents each. I am afraid\r\n\r\nto say that this bus guide is not in the least handy.\r\n\r\nIt  cannot be put easily into the pocket. It is  full\r\n\r\nof  advertisements and the information in it confuses\r\n\r\nrather  than  helps the commuters.  If  any  commuter\r\n\r\nfinds  it difficult to use, then what is the  purpose\r\n\r\nof  printing that bus guide? In fact, a very  eminent\r\n\r\ngeographer in Singapore pointed out the difficulty in\r\n\r\nlooking  for bus routes from the bus guide. How  then\r\n\r\nis  the  common man going to find the bus  routes  in\r\n\r\nthis complicated bus guide? Is it possible to issue a\r\n\r\nsimpler bus guide that can be handy and useful to the\r\n\r\ncommuter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, \"our telecommunications services are one of the\r\n\r\nbest    in    the   world.\"   That   is   what    the\r\n\r\nTelecommunication Authority claims. But to the people\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, I am afraid the opposite may be  true.\r\n\r\nVery  often  when  one  makes an  application  for  a\r\n\r\ntelephone,  one has to wait at times for as  long  as\r\n\r\none  year  or even longer to get a telephone.  Surely\r\n\r\nduring the pre-planning stages of a housing estate  a\r\n\r\ncertain  number of telephone lines could  be  planned\r\n\r\nand provided for the residents. Why is this not done?\r\n\r\nI hope the Minister will see that more lines are made\r\n\r\navailable at all housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in our transport system there is\r\n\r\nmuch  room  for improvement. We have been harping  on\r\n\r\nthe  Mass  Rapid  Transit System and money  has  been\r\n\r\nvoted  for  that particular project. Even  an  expert\r\n\r\nfrom  a foreign country had been here to make a study\r\n\r\nand  to make recommendations. Our Prime Minister  too\r\n\r\nhas  recently been to Hong Kong to see how the system\r\n\r\nworks  over there. Now what I want to know  is  this:\r\n\r\nAre  we  going to implement it? How soon  can  it  be\r\n\r\nimplemented? What type of transportation system  will\r\n\r\nbe used?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng is not here.

First  of all, I would like  to  extend  my\r\n\r\ncongratulations to the Ministry of Communications for\r\n\r\nthe  steps  they have taken to ensure that  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  an  improved system of public transport. It  has\r\n\r\ntaken time, but the fact that there is progress means\r\n\r\nthat  there  is hope for tomorrow. The problems  that\r\n\r\nfaced  the  Ministry have in fact taken a great  cost\r\n\r\nand  toil to officers of the various departments  and\r\n\r\nto  the public. But I am encouraged by the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  bus system today is an improved version of  what\r\n\r\nit was two years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the comments that the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson made earlier on with regard to bus guides,  may\r\n\r\nI  humbly  suggest to the Minister  that  instead  of\r\n\r\nissuing  bus  guides, bus routes could very  well  be\r\n\r\nplaced  at  all  bus stops under the heading  of  the\r\n\r\nparticular  service  number so  that  it  is  readily\r\n\r\navailable for easy reference. That is, some  form  of\r\n\r\nlaminated  card boards with the bus numbers  and  the\r\n\r\nbus  routes which. I think, is not difficult to make.\r\n\r\nIt only requires some organisation and some effort by\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry   of  Communications,   the   SBS   in\r\n\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the topic on Mass Rapid Transit\r\n\r\nwhich the Member for Anson has mentioned earlier, may\r\n\r\nI say that there has been tremendous public attention\r\n\r\nand interest on this subject. We realise that Phase I\r\n\r\nis  over  and Phase II of the feasibility  study  has\r\n\r\njust  been completed. In addition to that, the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  himself had made a personal  and  important\r\n\r\ntrip to Hong Kong to study the MRT system. I would be\r\n\r\nmost  grateful if the Minister could inform us as  to\r\n\r\nthe present state of the feasibility study of the MRT\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  its cost and the time  that  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken, if accepted, to implement the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to emphasise is\r\n\r\nthe  question of road discipline. Road discipline  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which is two-way. One is on the  level  of\r\n\r\npublic    sophistication,   its    discipline,    its\r\n\r\neducational status, and its social consciousness. The\r\n\r\nother  is  the  question  to  which  officialdom  and\r\n\r\nGovernment is willing to impose and to instruct.  May\r\n\r\nI  suggest that where the public has been failing  or\r\n\r\nunable to live up to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpectation  of good road discipline  that  there  is\r\n\r\nplace  for the ROV to impose stricter penalties  upon\r\n\r\nbad use of roads. I know that there are many problems\r\n\r\ninvolved  but at least in one respect may  I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry  look into this:  when  ambulance\r\n\r\ncars,  fire  engines  and  police  patrol  cars   are\r\n\r\nanswering  emergency calls, all other traffic  should\r\n\r\nbe  cautioned  and told to pull aside  to  facilitate\r\n\r\nthese  urgent vehicles answering emergency  calls  to\r\n\r\nget  to the scene of the accident, fire, or crime  or\r\n\r\nthe scene of any other urgent matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter which I would like the Minister to\r\n\r\nlook  into is the Area Licensing Scheme and the entry\r\n\r\nof vehicles in and out of the CBD during the hours of 7.30 a.m.  and  10.15 a.m. We all know that  the  Area\r\n\r\nLicensing  Scheme  has produced  somewhat  remarkable\r\n\r\nresults  in terms of cutting down traffic within  the\r\n\r\nCBD,  but taxis are a notable exception. It is common\r\n\r\nknowledge  that  the introduction of the  Scheme  has\r\n\r\nturned  out  to be of great benefit to a considerable\r\n\r\nnumber of taxi drivers. They pay the $4 fee to  enter\r\n\r\nthe  CBD and during those 2- hours they embark  on  a\r\n\r\ngreat  profit-making exercise. After paying  the  fee\r\n\r\nfor  entry,  they will plough in and out of  the  CBD\r\n\r\ncharging  each and every passenger the full  fee  for\r\n\r\nwhich  they  have  paid for just one  trip.  To  that\r\n\r\nextent  they are making a tremendous profit  and, in\r\n\r\nfact, fleecing the public. This is a matter that  can\r\n\r\nbe  looked  into,  and  I would suggest  that  urgent\r\n\r\nattention be paid to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these remarks I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Communications for its constant attention\r\n\r\nin  continuing to improve our public transport in the\r\n\r\nlast year or two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  discuss  a  little  about the  Government's  road\r\n\r\ntransport policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A matter which concerned me most was the sorry\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs  of  the  Singapore  bus  service.\r\n\r\nHowever,  over  the  past year,  it  has  shown  some\r\n\r\nimprovements.   The   most   perceptible   area    of\r\n\r\nimprovement I have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntold,  and which I myself observe, is in the  conduct\r\n\r\nof the drivers and conductors. Improvements have also\r\n\r\nbeen  made  in terms of service, routine, scheduling,\r\n\r\nroad-worthiness and cleanliness of the buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you would recall, in 1974 I\r\n\r\nproposed in essence in the first of a dozen principal\r\n\r\nQuestions  for  Oral  Answer,  for  the  Government's\r\n\r\ninvolvement in this field of public transport. It was\r\n\r\nmy  belief that there were amongst the ranks  of  cur\r\n\r\ncivil  servants, officers who could take care of  our\r\n\r\nbus  service. The 40-odd officers who have been  sent\r\n\r\nto  look  after  the  affairs of  the  Singapore  Bus\r\n\r\nService Ltd proved the point I made that-where  there\r\n\r\nis  a  will there is a way of putting our bus service\r\n\r\non  its  feet again. I also did propose, and I  would\r\n\r\nstill  press  on, that the Government should  have  a\r\n\r\nfinancial  stake in the Singapore Bus  Se'rvice  Ltd.\r\n\r\neven  if  it  has to be reorganized, so that  further\r\n\r\nimprovement  can be made in this public service.  The\r\n\r\nparticipation   of  the  SBS  employees   should   be\r\n\r\nconsidered, so that it would not be in their  vested\r\n\r\ninterest  to  see  the  SBS go down  the  drain.  The\r\n\r\nmanagement and the workers should weed out from their\r\n\r\nranks  all those who cannot make an honest living  or\r\n\r\nwho do not do an honest day's work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say that the bus is the main form of\r\n\r\ntransportation for the great majority of  the  people\r\n\r\nnow  and  by  the next decade or two the  Mass  Rapid\r\n\r\nTransit system concurrently serving the public. It is\r\n\r\nmy  calculation that it will cost millions of dollars\r\n\r\nto  improve  on the bus service and to construct  the\r\n\r\nMRT.  It  is  my guess that the millions  of  dollars\r\n\r\nwhich  would be raised by the increased Area  Licence\r\n\r\nFees,  road  taxes and additional registration  fees,\r\n\r\nwould come in handy for these two purposes, namely:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the Government's intention to purchase SBS\r\n\r\nshares, should the company go public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) For the development of the MRT system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the new taxes and fees were introduced, it\r\n\r\nwas  explained, if I am correct, that the  taxes  and\r\n\r\nfees  were not revenueorientated. In passing,  may  I\r\n\r\nobserve that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrevenue estimate for Road Tax for 1975 is $87 million\r\n\r\nand for 1976 it is $108 million, an increase of $20.4\r\n\r\nmillion.   The   revenue  estimate   for   Additional\r\n\r\nRegistration  Fees for 1975 is $41  million  and  for\r\n\r\n1976 it is $50 million. The revenue estimate for Area\r\n\r\nLicence Fees for 1975 is $5.4 million and for 1976 it\r\n\r\nis $6.5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the revenue is a question mark. If\r\n\r\nthe  money  raised is used to provide  a  better  bus\r\n\r\nservice  and to construct the MRT system,  I  make  a\r\n\r\nguess  that  Singaporeans, being calculative  people,\r\n\r\nwduld know the economy of being a bus commuter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service we provide to the bus commuters must\r\n\r\nreach  a  standard  comparable to western  countries.\r\n\r\nWith  the  will, it will be possible to  attain  this\r\n\r\nobjective in a couple of years' time. At this moment,\r\n\r\nthe   SBS  is  still  not  in  a  position  to   cope\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily  with the demand for its  service.  In\r\n\r\nview  of this, it does appear that the imposition  of\r\n\r\nsevere  measures against the use of private transport\r\n\r\nwas a little too premature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the opinion that the Area Licensing Scheme's\r\n\r\nrestricted  hours  commencing  at  7.30  am.,  as  at\r\n\r\npresent, are causing a lot of hardship to private car\r\n\r\nowners who have to send their children to school.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  you  could imagine  how  early  these\r\n\r\nchildren  would have to be awakened from their  sleep\r\n\r\nin order that their parents could beat the restricted\r\n\r\nhours.  I  wish  to  repeat what I said  during  last\r\n\r\nyear's debate: that the restricted hours should begin\r\n\r\nat 8.00 am, and not 7.30 am. It is my experience that\r\n\r\nour  roads are never congested at this hour, but only\r\n\r\nmuch  later, most unfortunately when the big wigs  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  profession and business go  driving  into\r\n\r\nthe Central Business District.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that the introduction of the Area\r\n\r\nLicensing  Scheme is not to thin out road traffic  so\r\n\r\nmuch as to give the appearance that the roads have to\r\n\r\nbe   cleared  for  Government  bureaucrats,  business\r\n\r\nexecutives  and  successful  professionals  to  drive\r\n\r\nsmartly  into the City like emperors, maharajahs  and\r\n\r\nsultans  of  days  long gone by. If  this  is  so,  I\r\n\r\nenvisage that the development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncosts  of roads, whilst borne by the taxpayers, would\r\n\r\nbenefit relatively fewer car owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to state, however, that most of the measures\r\n\r\ntaken  to  discourage private car ownership  and  the\r\n\r\nentry  of  traffic  into the CBD are  necessary.  The\r\n\r\nnation's administrative and business life should  not\r\n\r\nbe  smothered  by  traffic congestion.  In  the  same\r\n\r\nconnection,  our industrial and transport  activities\r\n\r\nmust not be slowed down. There are growing signs that\r\n\r\nroads  leading to Jurong Town are becoming  congested\r\n\r\nwith  traffic.  Therefore, it might  be  feasible  to\r\n\r\ncurtail  the  flow of private transport  into  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown   in  the  not  too  distant  future.  It  might\r\n\r\nincidentally  cut  down the volume of  traffic  along\r\n\r\ncross-town roads, like Scotts Road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I wish to state that I would\r\n\r\nagree  that our road and transport policy must be  in\r\n\r\nthe  direction of further development and utilisation\r\n\r\nof the public transport system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very nice to receive\r\n\r\ncongratulations from Hon. Members. My only regret  is\r\n\r\nthat  my predecessor is not here. Otherwise, he would\r\n\r\nbe most pleased at the progress that has been made, a\r\n\r\ngreater part of which was achieved during his time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly agree that there has been\r\n\r\ntremendous improvement in the public transport system\r\n\r\nand   this,  in  a  great  measure,  is  due  to  the\r\n\r\ncooperation of the workers and also to the secondment\r\n\r\nof  a  Government Team of Officials to  the  SBS.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be  appropriate here to mention  some  of  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  which  the Management  Team  has  taken  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  bus  service and also  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nstandard of discipline among the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things they did was to keep personal\r\n\r\nfiles  of  employees, and they  drew  up  a  code  of\r\n\r\nconduct  and  disciplinary  procedures.  Disciplinary\r\n\r\naction   is  also  being  centrally  dealt  with   by\r\n\r\nheadquarters. In this way, they were able to spot the\r\n\r\nblack  sheep among the employees and remove them  for\r\n\r\nthe good of the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drivers, conductors and other persons who have been\r\n\r\nrecruited are given training prior to putting them on\r\n\r\nthe   job.  They  were  told  of  their  duties   and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities and they were also told  to  provide\r\n\r\nservice  with courtesy and with a smile.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nsome do not perform satisfactorily and, when spotted,\r\n\r\nare sent back for refresher courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been a strengthening of the\r\n\r\nEnforcement  Section. The duties of  the  Enforcement\r\n\r\nSection  are,  first, to ensure that  bus  fares  are\r\n\r\nproperly  collected, buses run on time, and to  catch\r\n\r\ndrivers   who   speed.  Based   on   their   reports.\r\n\r\ndisciplinary action is taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the indicators to show that there has been\r\n\r\ngreat improvement in the bus service and the way  the\r\n\r\nemployees discharge their duty is the decrease in the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  complaints received. In fact,  complaints\r\n\r\nhave dropped by as much as 75%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the observation made by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson.  He  mentioned about the  long  wait  for\r\n\r\nrefuelling of buses. I know it is very irritating for\r\n\r\ncommuters  to  have to wait in the bus  while  it  is\r\n\r\nbeing refuelled. Action is being taken to ensure that\r\n\r\nevery  bus, before leaving the depot in the  morning,\r\n\r\nis  fuelled the night before. But it is essential for\r\n\r\nevery bus to be refuelled at least once a day because\r\n\r\nit  travels on an average of 250 miles, and  it  does\r\n\r\nnot  carry  a  tank large enough to  hold  sufficient\r\n\r\ndiesel oil for a journey of 250 miles. Anyway,  buses\r\n\r\nare  refuelled as far as possible during the off-peak\r\n\r\nhours.  More refuelling terminals are being  set  up,\r\n\r\nand  in certain places two oil pumps are in use. This\r\n\r\nproblem is being looked into, and I think there  will\r\n\r\nbe a great improvement soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Member for Anson, I deplore the end of the\r\n\r\nera  of the 5-cent and 10-cent char kway teow and mee\r\n\r\ngoreng  with  eggs, in the same way that he  deplores\r\n\r\nthe end of the 5-cent and 10-cent bus fares. One must\r\n\r\nremember  that  there  are  factors  which  make   it\r\n\r\nimpossible  to  retain the old  rates  of  fares  and\r\n\r\nprices. Hon. Members certainly are aware of inflation\r\n\r\nand may recollect that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprice  of diesel oil has gone up. The SBS has to  pay\r\n\r\nhigher  wages  and also the NWC wage recommendations.\r\n\r\nThese are the factors which increase costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has mentioned about the delay in\r\n\r\nschedules. SBS has more buses on the road because  of\r\n\r\nbetter  maintenance  of the buses.  Here  again,  the\r\n\r\nimprovement  has  been due in  some  measure  to  the\r\n\r\nsecondment of an SAF team to help maintain the buses.\r\n\r\nTo  maintain  buses, we must have  spare  parts.  The\r\n\r\ncosts of spare parts have also gone up. So it is  not\r\n\r\ntrue  to  say that the 5-cent and 10-cent  bus  fares\r\n\r\nhave  disappeared  because  the  bus  companies   are\r\n\r\namalgamated and there is a monopoly. There are  other\r\n\r\nirresistible factors at work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems of running an efficient bus\r\n\r\nservice  is  to provide sufficient buses during  peak\r\n\r\nhours. But what do you do with these buses during the\r\n\r\noff-peak hours? The buses will lie idle and the  crew\r\n\r\nalso   will  be  idle  and  they  have  to  be   paid\r\n\r\nnevertheless. So one way of solving this  problem  is\r\n\r\nto allow the Scheme B buses and also the City Shuttle\r\n\r\nService  to  continue. In this way, I  think  we  are\r\n\r\nmaximising  the  use of all available buses,  because\r\n\r\nduring  part  of the peak hours in the  mornings  and\r\n\r\nevenings  the Scheme B buses are usually quite  free.\r\n\r\nDuring  the  hours  when  they  are  not  engaged  in\r\n\r\ntransporting  children  to  school,  they   help   in\r\n\r\ntransporting other commuters. In this way, they  help\r\n\r\nto take the load off the SBS during peak hours, and I\r\n\r\nthink it is necessary that they should be allowed  to\r\n\r\ncarry on for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the bus guide is a most unfortunate\r\n\r\none.  The  bus  guide  was put  up  as  a  commercial\r\n\r\nproposition   by   a  private  firm  which   obtained\r\n\r\ninformation  about  the  bus  schedules   and   other\r\n\r\nrelevant  information from the Singapore Bus  Service\r\n\r\nLtd.   As  a  commercial  venture,  of  course,  they\r\n\r\ncanvassed   for  advertisements.  Unfortunately,   in\r\n\r\nfinalising the format of the bus guide, they did  not\r\n\r\nconsult  the  SBS. As a result they produced  a  very\r\n\r\npoor  bus  guide  and  probably  lost  money  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess.  Anyway, arising from this  experience,  the\r\n\r\nSBS will probably\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nput up their own bus guide. The suggestion made by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Kim Seng about posting information on  bus\r\n\r\nroutes  at bus stops will be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nI will forward the suggestion to the SBS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng did suggest that in order to\r\n\r\nensure  better road discipline there should be heavier\r\n\r\npenalties.  Heavier penalties have been imposed.  More\r\n\r\ndetails  will be given by my Minister of State during,\r\n\r\nthe  debate  on  the  ROV. As  Members  know,  and  as\r\n\r\nindicated by the Member for Kim Seng, penalties  alone\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  sufficient to  raise  the  standard  of\r\n\r\ncourtesy  among motorists. There is also the  question\r\n\r\nof education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his suggestion that ambulances, Police\r\n\r\ncars and fire engines should have the right of way.  I\r\n\r\nentirely agree with him. Here, again, it is a question\r\n\r\nof   social  conscience,  and  consideration  by   the\r\n\r\nmotorists,  the cyclists, the scootenists,  and  other\r\n\r\nroad  users for each other's welfare and for  that  of\r\n\r\nthe  community.  It will come about through  education\r\n\r\nand   not  through  sheer  enforcement  of  penalties.\r\n\r\nAnyway, there is a saying that a journey of a thousand\r\n\r\nmiles  begins with the first step. We have  taken  the\r\n\r\nfirst  step  to  warn motorists that  these  emergency\r\n\r\nvehicles should have the right of way. I hope that  in\r\n\r\ntime  to come motorists will have enough consideration\r\n\r\nfor  their fellowmen to decide what is right and  what\r\n\r\nis  wrong, and no matter how much they are in a hurry,\r\n\r\nthey will give way to these emergency vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the Area Licensing Scheme, I do not agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  Member for Kim Seng when he said that  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers benefit from the ALS. Some of the black  sheep\r\n\r\ndo  benefit,  however. He says that they charge  every\r\n\r\npassenger  the ALS fee of $4. If they are able  to  do\r\n\r\nthis, we would have seen an increase in the number  of\r\n\r\ntaxis  applying for the ALS licences. In actual  fact,\r\n\r\nthere has been a decrease in the sale of ALS licences.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  taxis drivers might be able to get away  with\r\n\r\nthis in the beginning. But ultimately the public would\r\n\r\nget wiser. Anyway, we have a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevice whereby the time of purchase of the ALS licence\r\n\r\nby  taxi  drivers  is indicated  on  the  disc.  If  a\r\n\r\npassenger is observant, he will notice this and should\r\n\r\nnot  pay for it once the taxi driver has recovered his\r\n\r\npayment  for the licence from his previous  passenger.\r\n\r\nHe  need not pay for it. The Enforcement Officers  are\r\n\r\ngoing  round to see that cheating of this nature  does\r\n\r\nnot  take  place. If a taxi driver is  found  to  have\r\n\r\nseverally  charged passengers for the ALS  entry  fee,\r\n\r\naction will be taken against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang has suggested that the\r\n\r\nGovernment should participate in the equity holding of\r\n\r\nthe  SBS.  We  are  now considering  the  question  of\r\n\r\nworkers  participating in the equity  holding  of  the\r\n\r\nSBS.  It  is too early in the day for me to  make  any\r\n\r\nannouncement. But we are seriously considering whether\r\n\r\nit is advisable to allow the workers to participate in\r\n\r\nthis, and ultimately Government's participation too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his suggestion that revenue from the\r\n\r\nincrease in road taxes and registration fees should go\r\n\r\ntowards  the  development of the MRT. I can  only  say\r\n\r\nthat the increase is negligible. The MRT will cost not\r\n\r\nmillions but billions of dollars. But he is correct in\r\n\r\nsaying that the purpose of the increase in the ALS fee\r\n\r\nand  the  other  fees is not to raise revenue  but  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  people from owning cars,  thus  preventing\r\n\r\nour  roads  from  being choked by too  heavy  traffic,\r\n\r\nthereby hindering our economic progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also suggested that we should revise the\r\n\r\ncommencement of the ALS from 7.30 am, to 8.00 am. This\r\n\r\nquestion  has  been looked into by  the  experts.  His\r\n\r\nreason is that this is to allow parents to send  their\r\n\r\nchildren to schools in the CBD. He also says  that  in\r\n\r\nhis  experience he has not seen any traffic jam during\r\n\r\nthis  period. I say that if we were to extend the time\r\n\r\nto  8.00 am. He will experience a traffic jam. At  the\r\n\r\nmoment  there is no congestion because the ALS  begins\r\n\r\nat 7.30 am. There are very few schools within the CBD.\r\n\r\nIf  the parents want their children to go to school by\r\n\r\ncar, there is no reason why\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  form  car pools. The  Methodist  Girls'\r\n\r\nSchool  has  formed  car  pools  quite  successfully.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  their children could take buses because,  as\r\n\r\nhe has said, bus services have improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also said that perhaps the timing of the\r\n\r\nimposition  of  the restriction is not  quite  right.\r\n\r\nThat  is  a matter of opinion. However, in  the  same\r\n\r\nbreath  he  has  also suggested that it  is  time  we\r\n\r\nimposed restriction on entry into Jurong. Here  again\r\n\r\nit  is a matter of opinion. We think this is not  the\r\n\r\ntime  yet.  We are in charge of the ALS and  we  have\r\n\r\nenforced it in the City area. If the Member  were  in\r\n\r\nchange  he  would probably enforce it in Jurong  too.\r\n\r\nBut we are studying the problem closely. I agree with\r\n\r\nhim  that  restricting  entry of  private  cars  into\r\n\r\nJurong  may  help to clear the congestion around  the\r\n\r\nperiphery of Jurong Town. Anyway we should wait until\r\n\r\nthe Pan-Island Express Way is completed before we  go\r\n\r\nany further into this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may be wondering why I have not touched on\r\n\r\nthe  MRT  and give some information on the  questions\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been  asked. If I  may,  Sir,  with  the\r\n\r\nindulgence  of Members, call upon my Senior  Minister\r\n\r\nof  State,  who is very closely associated  with  the\r\n\r\nMRT, to reply to Members' comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to\r\n\r\nconfirm the statement made by the Member for Kim Seng\r\n\r\nthat  Phase  II  study  of  the  MRT  has  just  been\r\n\r\ncompleted. The final report of the Phase II MRT Study\r\n\r\nwill  be  ready sometime this year for submission  to\r\n\r\nthe  Cabinet.  It  will then be up  to  the  Cabinet,\r\n\r\ntaking  into  account the socio-economic factors  and\r\n\r\nother  considerations, to decide whether  or  not  to\r\n\r\nproceed  with  the  project. If the  decision  is  to\r\n\r\nproceed with it, which is planned to be some 45 km in\r\n\r\nlength,  of  which one-third will be underground, it\r\n\r\nwill  take  approximately 10 years to  construct.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, some sections of the system will be completed\r\n\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the construction cost of the system, I am afraid I do not have all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndetailed figures with me. Based or the current  price\r\n\r\nat  constant Dollar, the estimated cost of  the  full\r\n\r\nsystem  is in the region of $1 .7 billion. But taking\r\n\r\ninto  account inflation and interests fees that  will\r\n\r\nbe  incurred  during  the  construction  period,  the\r\n\r\nultimate  cost of the full system could  well  exceed\r\n\r\n$2.8 billion on completion of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just\r\n\r\nwant  to  make a point on the refuelling of buses.  I\r\n\r\nhave   had   a  number  of  experiences  with   buses\r\n\r\nrefuelling  at a place off Changi Road.  The  drivers\r\n\r\nseem  to  want  to  get over with the  refuelling  as\r\n\r\nquickly as possible, as I suppose, they have to  keep\r\n\r\nto  the time schedule. Therefore, and this is a point\r\n\r\nwhich the Member for Anson has brought up, there is a\r\n\r\ntendency for them to leave the engine on while  their\r\n\r\nvehicles  are  being  refuelled.  This  is  a  highly\r\n\r\ndangerous  practice. I hope the Minister  will  bring\r\n\r\nthis  matter to the attention of the SBS so that such\r\n\r\na  practice can be stopped. This is dangerous for the\r\n\r\ndrivers, the conductors and the passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, action has\r\n\r\nbeen taken to stop this dangerous practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Minister of State has already replied to\r\n\r\nquestions  on the MRT. I would like to  take  up  the\r\n\r\npoint mentioned by the Member for Anson regarding the\r\n\r\nlong  wait for telephones. Earlier in the day n  this\r\n\r\nHouse, when the question was raised about the waiting\r\n\r\ntime  for  telephones, the reply given by the  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  was that we  were  making  every\r\n\r\nattempt  to  reduce the percentage of applicants  who\r\n\r\nhave to wait for telephones. Here again, it is not  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  bad  planning.  When  we  draw   up   a\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plan  for  the  future,  estimates   are\r\n\r\nusually made. We are very wise men indeed if  we  can\r\n\r\nbe  perfect in our est mates. It has been shown  that\r\n\r\nthe   demand   for   telephones  has   risen   beyond\r\n\r\nexpectations.  In other words, our experts  estimated\r\n\r\nthat  there  would be a demand-increase  of  15%  per\r\n\r\nyear, but the actual demand has gone up by 20%. There\r\n\r\nis  also the question of backlog. I think credit must\r\n\r\nbe given to the Housing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBoard  for  having  built houses  very  quickly, much\r\n\r\nquicker  than we can install the telephones. They  are\r\n\r\nbuilding flats all over Singapore now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time-lag for installing telephone equipment is\r\n\r\nfive  years.  If we draw up the plans today  and  then\r\n\r\nplace  our orders, it will be five years later  before\r\n\r\nwe  can actually get the equipment. That is one of the\r\n\r\nreasons   why   we  have  to  make  these   estimates.\r\n\r\nTherefore, given the time-lag of five years  and  with\r\n\r\nthe  Housing Board putting up flats in less  than  two\r\n\r\nyears  in some places, there is this discrepancy.  But\r\n\r\nwhatever it is, we are doing our best to catch up with\r\n\r\nthe  backlog. In fact, the TAS have been asked whether\r\n\r\nit  is  possible to make use of overhead lines because\r\n\r\nit is faster to install telephones this way. They have\r\n\r\nmade use of overhead lines and that is how we catch up\r\n\r\nwith  the  demand.  But one must remember  that  lines\r\n\r\nalone are not enough. There must also be the switching\r\n\r\nequipment  to go with it. Anyway, for the  information\r\n\r\nof  Members,  we  have tried to make use  of  all  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  available. For example. Telok Blangah  New\r\n\r\nTown  is now being served by the North Exchange  sited\r\n\r\nat the Thomson Road/Whitley Road junction. Since there\r\n\r\nis excess capacity there, we are tapping it for use in\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah New Town. Nevertheless, the demand  for\r\n\r\ntelephones  in Telok Blangah is so great that  tapping\r\n\r\nthe  excess  in this Exchange which is  not  meant  to\r\n\r\nserve  Telok Blangah is still not sufficient. It  will\r\n\r\nbe some more time before the equipment is available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Member for Telok Blangah may be pleased\r\n\r\nto  hear  that next month we are putting into  service\r\n\r\n10,000  pieces of switching equipment. For the Ang  Mo\r\n\r\nKio  New  Town, the new Exchange building is scheduled\r\n\r\nto   be  completed  in  October  1976.  The  necessary\r\n\r\nswitching  equipment will follow immediately, and  by\r\n\r\nOctober 1977 all the residents in Ang Mo Kio New  Town\r\n\r\nwill  get  their telephones. One way in which  we  can\r\n\r\nreduce waiting time would be for intending subscribers\r\n\r\nto  come together and share a party line. But quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber of them are quite choosey. An offer of a  party\r\n\r\nline  has  been made but quite a number of  them  have\r\n\r\nturned it down. If they are really in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nurgent need, they can always share a party line,  that\r\n\r\nis, if service is available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the Minister two questions. First,  regarding\r\n\r\ntelephone  equipment ordered and bought  from  abroad.\r\n\r\nJust  now  the Minister said that it was necessary  to\r\n\r\nplace orders for such equipment five years ahead.  Why\r\n\r\nshould  we have to wait for so long before we can  get\r\n\r\nthem? I would like the Minister to explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is it possible for our manufacturers to\r\n\r\nproduce  telephone  equipment  here,  since  we   have\r\n\r\nreached quite a high level of technology? If so, there\r\n\r\nwill  be  no  problem for the EDB and the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nScience   and  Technology  to  set  up  factories   to\r\n\r\nmanufacture  our own telephone equipment for  our  own\r\n\r\nneeds.  In  this  way, we will  be  able  to  get  our\r\n\r\ntelephone facilities earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the Minister two simple questions. The first  one\r\n\r\nis:  yesterday some Members in this House alleged that\r\n\r\nthe   rural  people  are  regarded  as  second   class\r\n\r\ncitizens. I do not agree to this view. However, we can\r\n\r\nall agree on the point, that the buses used in serving\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas are all outdated and useless. I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister will be able to provide better buses  to\r\n\r\nserve  these  areas  and  perhaps  also  provide  good\r\n\r\ndrivers to man such buses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about some comments by MPs here\r\n\r\nthat  the SBS has improved a lot in its service. Maybe\r\n\r\nthe Minister is very pleased about this remark. But  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  say something which  he  may  not  be\r\n\r\npleased to hear. In spite of the SBS service,  if  you\r\n\r\nask  whether  there are pirate taxis  running  on  the\r\n\r\nroads,  I should say yes. So I hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\nlook into this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I can assure the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang  that if we could manufacture the  telephone\r\n\r\nequipment  here, we would have done so. We  could  not\r\n\r\nget   anyone   interested  enough  to  join   in   the\r\n\r\nmanufacture  of  telephone  switching  equipment,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore the waiting time needed is still five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the rural areas, the request is for new\r\n\r\nbuses  for  rural residents. I think there have  been\r\n\r\nnew  buses  for  rural  residents  but,  taking  into\r\n\r\nconsideration the nature of rural roads, they  become\r\n\r\nold  buses in no time. Much as we like to, we  cannot\r\n\r\nbe changing buses every six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member is probably right that there are\r\n\r\npirate taxis around.

But I would say that in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas  the  roads  are  also  quite  wide  and\r\n\r\nmetalled,  not  as bad as the Minister has  imagined.\r\n\r\nThe  position is this. The rural people will have  to\r\n\r\nwalk  along bad unmetalled tracks in order  to  reach\r\n\r\nthe main road to board a bus. So, buses still run  on\r\n\r\ngood  roads.  If  you can go there, you  will  notice\r\n\r\nthis. I hope in the rural areas one can see new buses\r\n\r\nto provide the rural folks with better services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Why  does  the  SBS  not  take  statistics?\r\n\r\nSomebody  must  go there to see how  many  buses  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  Katong,  how  many  buses  are  going   to\r\n\r\nSerangoon,  how many buses are going to  Geylang.  If\r\n\r\nthey  do  it, then they will know how many buses  are\r\n\r\nrequired  there.  This long queue of  buses  is  seen\r\n\r\ndaily. The Minister can check on it. It is no use  to\r\n\r\nkeep  20  buses lined up, while only one bus is  full\r\n\r\nand  the  others  are empty. What is  the  system  of\r\n\r\nworking?  I  do not understand the SBS's  system.  In\r\n\r\nthis  long  queue  of  buses, there  are  SBS  buses,\r\n\r\nprivate  buses  and shuttle service  buses.  What  is\r\n\r\nthis?

(* The same amendment also stood in the name Mr P. Govindaswamy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is moved to make some\r\n\r\nsuggestions  in  respect of the airport  services  at\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar  Airport. Those who arrive  from  abroad,\r\n\r\nespecially during congested periods which often occur\r\n\r\nat  night,  find that in our Arrival lounge  lots  of\r\n\r\npassengers  who have two or three pieces  of  luggage\r\n\r\nfind  it difficult to carry their luggages out. There\r\n\r\nis a shortage of porters. I do not advocate that more\r\n\r\nporters be employed. Perhaps manpower should  be  put\r\n\r\nto better use rather than just allowed to hang around\r\n\r\nto  carry  bags. But I do advocate, and I  have  made\r\n\r\nthis suggestion some years ago, that we provide these\r\n\r\narrival passengers with light hand-trolleys for their\r\n\r\nconvenience.  They need not wait. As  soon  as  their\r\n\r\nluggage  comes down the conveyor belt, it would  make\r\n\r\nit  very convenient for them to get their luggage out\r\n\r\nwith a trolley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second suggestion I would like to make is\r\n\r\nin  respect of the taxi service at the airport.  Here\r\n\r\nagain, especially at peak hours at night, with  large\r\n\r\nplanes  arriving these days, there is a  shortage  of\r\n\r\ntaxis.  Sometimes  one  has to  wait  for  35  to  40\r\n\r\nminutes,  without exaggeration, because I myself  had\r\n\r\nto  wait  for 40 minutes for a taxi. I am  told  that\r\n\r\nthis is the result of a restriction on the number  of\r\n\r\ntaxis  that are allowed to go into the airport  area.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Ministry should look into the possibility\r\n\r\nof  increasing  the number of taxis  allowed  in  the\r\n\r\nairport  at the moment. With more taxis, perhaps  the\r\n\r\nwaiting period could be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the taxi service operating at the\r\n\r\nairport  is  a  very lucrative one because  the  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  have other \"fringe benefits\" and  the  extra\r\n\r\ncharge   which  they  sometimes  impose  on  arriving\r\n\r\npassengers from abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Are these expenditures  really\r\n\r\nnecessary? Can we not manage with a reduced amount of\r\n\r\nexpenditure for Paya Lehar and concentrate on  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport instead?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, soon Changi will become an international\r\n\r\nairport.  For how long will it remain so,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow.  We  had  Kallang  at the  beginning;  then  we\r\n\r\nswitched  to Paya Lehar, and now we move  to  Changi,\r\n\r\neven  before the second runway at Paya Lehar and  the\r\n\r\nextensions  could be completed Originally,  when  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  wanted to expand Paya Lebar Airport,  the\r\n\r\nengineers tested the soil at Changi and they said, at\r\n\r\nthat  time,  they could not develop  an  `airport  at\r\n\r\nChangi  because  the soil was not strong.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthey  came  back to Paya Lebar Airport Now they  say.\r\n\r\n\"Move  to Changi\". We have spent so many millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars at Paya Lebar and now we are moving to Changi\r\n\r\nA  certain  amount of foresight thinking is required.\r\n\r\nIs  Changi  Airport really necessary? Are  we  really\r\n\r\ngoing  to  expect the predicted increase in tourists?\r\n\r\nHave  we given the allowance that many persons  think\r\n\r\ntwice  before  they  travel nowadays?  Or  is  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport  going to he one project that will be  little\r\n\r\nused?  Could  we  not  just manage  with  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nAirport for several decades?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt certain amount of pollution is involved No\r\n\r\ndoubt  reclamation  and resettlement  of  people  are\r\n\r\ninvolved.  But  these are unavoidable for  an  island\r\n\r\nlike  Singapore  that is too small.

Since early this year an additional 150 push-carts  have  been  put into use, and  there  are  now\r\n\r\naltogether about 150 push-carts at the Arrival hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the second question raised by the Member\r\n\r\nabout the airport taxi services. I would like to take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity to inform him that the airport taxi\r\n\r\nservice  is  undergoing  a reorganisation  so  as  to\r\n\r\nimprove  its  efficiency  and  the  conduct  of  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers. At the same time we are thinking of  further\r\n\r\nincreasing  the  fleet  of  taxis  operating  at  the\r\n\r\nairport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few questions raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  One is about the question of the vast sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney  allocated  to the development  of  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nAirport after the decision has been made to move  our\r\n\r\ninternational airport to Changi Sir, the air  traffic\r\n\r\nthrough  Singapore  for  the  next  few  years   will\r\n\r\ncontinue to increase and the Paya Lebar Airport  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be the main civil airport for  Singapore\r\n\r\nup  to  1 980, when it is expected to handle  over  8\r\n\r\nmillion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassengers  a  year, or almost double the  number  of\r\n\r\npassengers  that was handled last year. In  1972  the\r\n\r\nconsultants  made  the forecast that  the  number  of\r\n\r\npassengers  passing through our airport  would  reach\r\n\r\nsomething like 4 million in 1975, but since  the  oil\r\n\r\ncrisis  in 1973 this figure has been revised. Despite\r\n\r\nthe   oil  crisis,  however,  the  passenger  traffic\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  increase  and  the  actual  figure  of\r\n\r\npassenger  traffic passing through Singapore  Airport\r\n\r\nlast  year is not very far off the mark of  what  was\r\n\r\nprojected.  Paya  Lebar Airport,  besides  having  to\r\n\r\nhandle  all this passenger traffic up to 1980,  would\r\n\r\nstill be in use in conjunction with the Changi (Phase\r\n\r\nI)  Airport, which will be completed sometime in 1980\r\n\r\nor  1981 because the full Changi Airport Development,\r\n\r\nincluding  the second phase, will' not  be  completed\r\n\r\nuntil 1982 or 1983.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also mentioned about the $80\r\n\r\nmillion  land reclamation cost at Changi. Of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  money comes from taxpayers. The actual  cost  of\r\n\r\nthe  reclamation is, in fact, about $235 million  for\r\n\r\nthe  entire reclamation project, but only $80 million\r\n\r\nwill be required for the coming financial year as the\r\n\r\ntotal reclamation work would take over three years to\r\n\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about the role of the Paya\r\n\r\nLebar Airport after Changi Airport. I can assure  him\r\n\r\nthat Paya Lebar Airport will be put to good use, as I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned  earlier, during the  interim  period\r\n\r\nbetween  now  and  1982. It will later  be  used,  in\r\n\r\naddition   to  military  operations,  to  cater   for\r\n\r\nemergency or overspill of civil aircraft traffic from\r\n\r\nChangi Airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the important role that Paya Lebar\r\n\r\nAirport will continue to play in this interim  period\r\n\r\nbetween  now  and  1982, a new  direct  express  road\r\n\r\nlinking Paya Lebar and Changi Airport will be  built.\r\n\r\nThis  link-road will be completed by the end of  1979\r\n\r\n50  that it will provide a fast and efficient flow of\r\n\r\npassenger motor vehicles between the two airports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should also take this opportunity to explain to the Member for Anson the main\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreasons  for  moving to Changi. There are,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nthree  major reasons for the Government to decide  to\r\n\r\nmove  the airport from Paya Lebar to Changi. Firstly,\r\n\r\nit  is a matter of timing. As I mentioned earlier, it\r\n\r\nis projected that by 1980 we will be handling some  8\r\n\r\nmillion  passenger traffic through our airport  in  a\r\n\r\nyear.  But due to the physical difficulties  at  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  airport,  such as drainage,  canal  diversion,\r\n\r\nsquatter  resettlement, removal of rubbish dumps  and\r\n\r\nrefilling  of the swampy areas around our Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nAirport, our engineers concluded that it would  take\r\n\r\nsome  nine years to build the second runway  at  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar.  This would mean that, if we start work today,\r\n\r\nthe second runway at Paya Lebar would be completed by\r\n\r\n1984  or  1985.  Obviously this is  not  good  enough\r\n\r\nbecause  by that time the Airport would face  a  very\r\n\r\nserious  congestion and we would loose the  tourists.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other hand, the present runway at the Changi\r\n\r\nairfield  could  be  easily lengthened, widened  and\r\n\r\nstrengthened    into   a   runway   acceptable    for\r\n\r\ninternational air traffic operations by the middle of\r\n\r\n1980, while the second runway at Changi will be built\r\n\r\non  land reclaimed from the sea and it could be ready\r\n\r\nby  the middle of 1982. This means two or three years\r\n\r\nahead of scheduled completion of the second runway at\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar. It is therefore a question of timing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason for moving to Changi is on\r\n\r\nenvironmental considerations, mainly noise pollution.\r\n\r\nIf  the second runway were to be built at Paya Lebar,\r\n\r\nthe  noise generated by the aircraft taking  off  and\r\n\r\nlanding at Paya Lebar Airport would affect a  lot  of\r\n\r\npeople living in the area, whose houses are under the\r\n\r\nflight  path. Noise pollution caused to the  proposed\r\n\r\nChangi site will not be spread over as large a sector\r\n\r\nof  the  population as at Paya Lebar because a  large\r\n\r\narea of the flight path of aircraft calling at Changi\r\n\r\nAirport will be over water and not over land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third reason for moving to Changi. I am sure\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson would be happy to know that the\r\n\r\nchoice  was  made on the ground that  the  number  of\r\n\r\npeople   affected  by  resettlement  would  be   less\r\n\r\ncompared to the number of people affected, if we were\r\n\r\nto proceed with the second\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrunway  at  Paya Lebar. The figure is something  like\r\n\r\n800 families in Changi being affected by resettlement\r\n\r\nas  against 4.000 families in Paya Lebar. Earlier  we\r\n\r\nhave  heard  grievances expressed by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nChangi about the kelong resettlement operations. This\r\n\r\nshifting  of airport to Changi means more  saving  in\r\n\r\ncosts, very much less irritation and frustration  and\r\n\r\nreduced  strain on social structure. From  all  these\r\n\r\nconsiderations, therefore, Changi is  a  much  better\r\n\r\nchoice  than  Paya Lebar as a location for  our  main\r\n\r\ninternational airport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the long-term future of the Changi Airport, the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson is concerned as to why we moved  our\r\n\r\nairport  from  Kallang to Paya Leban  and  from  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar to Changi and what comes next after Changi. The\r\n\r\nMember  can be assured that Changi Airport  with  the\r\n\r\ntwo runways and all the supporting facilities will be\r\n\r\nable  to  handle  at least 30 million passengers  per\r\n\r\nyear, and this will meet the needs of Singapore up to\r\n\r\nthe  end  of this century. Provisions have been  made\r\n\r\nfor  further  extension of the Airport to  cater  for\r\n\r\nfurther  increases  in traffic so  that  Changi  will\r\n\r\nremain  our main international airport well into  the\r\n\r\n21st century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification.\r\n\r\nCould the Minister of State inform the House what  is\r\n\r\nthe projected number of aircraft expected to land  at\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar by 1985, because this has got something to\r\n\r\ndo with the noise pollution aspect which he mentioned\r\n\r\njust now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Regarding the annual commercial\r\n\r\naircraft movement of arrivals and departures  at  our\r\n\r\nAirport by 1985, I have not got the figures for 1985.\r\n\r\nFor 1982, the projected figure is 82,627.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Is it double the present figure?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> The present number of aircraft\r\n\r\nmovement  is  59.000.

I have had\r\n\r\noccasion  to be present at the airport and I  noticed\r\n\r\nthat a certain aricraft was being serviced during  an\r\n\r\nelectrical  storm. When questioning the workers  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  this,  I was given to understand  that  a\r\n\r\nsupervisor  urged  them to do  maintenance  work  and\r\n\r\nservicing  it. Of course, this electrical storm  does\r\n\r\nnot occur frequently, but if it exists at the airport\r\n\r\nit is very dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering if the Minister could take steps to\r\n\r\nensure  that  when such electrical  storms  do  occur\r\n\r\nworkers should not be asked to go out to service  the\r\n\r\nairplanes. Or perhaps more hangars could be built  so\r\n\r\nthat  these  airplanes  could  be  brought  into  the\r\n\r\nhangars where proper servicing could be conducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I tend to agree with the\r\n\r\nMember for Potong Pasir that where it is dangerous to\r\n\r\nwork  under  those conditions, perhaps the supervisor\r\n\r\nshould  exercise his discretion as to whether or  not\r\n\r\nthe  work  should  proceed. Of course,  in  cases  of\r\n\r\nurgency where work has to be done, it is not just the\r\n\r\nsafety  of  the workers at the airport but  also  the\r\n\r\nsafety of the passengers arriving from overseas  that\r\n\r\nhas to be considered.

By the time I used the Arrival lounge last\r\n\r\nyear   there  were  hardly  20  serviceable  trolleys\r\n\r\naround.  The very fact that it has been increased  by\r\n\r\n200 this year, which is more than 200% from what were\r\n\r\navailable, that is a good sign. Perhaps every now and\r\n\r\nthen  one  ought to check whether these trolleys  are\r\n\r\nserviceable  and  additional  trolleys,   should   be\r\n\r\npurchased whenever necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those remarks, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis very satisfactory. It has got powerful fans located at\r\n\r\na  high  level. There are two restrooms provided for  the\r\n\r\nstaff and these rooms have louvred windows and there  are\r\n\r\nalso  fans  installed  to  provide  ventilation.  On  the\r\n\r\nquestion of dirty fans. I will ask the Postmaster-General\r\n\r\nto  look  into this, but during my last visit  I  thought\r\n\r\nthey were quite clean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the enclosure for registered mail, it is not\r\n\r\ntrue  to  say  that anyone can climb over the  fence  and\r\n\r\nfiddle  with  the registered items. During working  hours\r\n\r\nthere  are  workmen  working within  the  enclosure  both\r\n\r\ninside  and outside the place. So it is quite  safe.  But\r\n\r\nduring  the period when there are no staff working inside\r\n\r\nthe  enclosure, all  the registered mails  are  normally\r\n\r\nsealed  up in bags and kept inside the covered enclosures\r\n\r\nwhich  are fitted with locks. If there are other  further\r\n\r\nimprovements  that could be made. I would be  pleased  if\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson could let me know so that I can take\r\n\r\nthe matter up again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Postal Department is always conscious of the welfare\r\n\r\nof  its  staff  and it has been regularly  reviewing  the\r\n\r\nworking environment of the department and other places of\r\n\r\nwork under its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the uniforms for postwomen, I am glad\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member  for  Anson finds the  present  uniform\r\n\r\nsuitable. As he has pointed out, the uniform is neat  and\r\n\r\nsmart. However, if a postwoman is in an advanced stage of\r\n\r\npregnancy,  arrangements will be made for her to  perform\r\n\r\nlighter  indoor duties. She will naturally be allowed  to\r\n\r\nwear her own maternity clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

That is the reason  why  I  have\r\n\r\nbrought  this matter to the attention of the Minister.

(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs N. Govindasamy, Chin Harn Tong, Ivan Baptist and P. Govindaswamy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask for some information arising out\r\n\r\nof  my  scrutiny  of certain revenue accruing  to  the\r\n\r\nHead,  Registrar of Vehicles, for the  composition  of\r\n\r\noffences.  According  to  the  figures  which  I  have\r\n\r\ngarnered  for FY 76, the revenue anticipated  is  $1.1\r\n\r\nmillion. For FY 75 it was $900,000. For FY 74  it  was\r\n\r\n$830,000 and for FY 73 it was one-tenth of that,  i.e.\r\n\r\n$80,000.  The  question is, to what extent  are  these\r\n\r\nmonies reflective of our policy of more efficient  and\r\n\r\ngreaten enforcement, and has this policy paid  out  in\r\n\r\nthe  reduction  of  accidents? If  one  looks  at  the\r\n\r\ntraffic, one has the impression that there is  a  very\r\n\r\nslight, if at all, recognisable reduction in breaches\r\n\r\nof traffic regulations, especially in respect of those\r\n\r\nvehicles that I presume come under the jurisdiction of\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar of Vehicles. But I stand to be educated\r\n\r\nby the Minister of State for Communications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I merely\r\n\r\nwant  to  make a suggestion. When we were speaking  on\r\n\r\nbus  services, a lot of bouquets were given to the 585\r\n\r\nfor the improvement of the bus service.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  bus  service has improved  tremendously\r\n\r\ncompared  with what it was a few years  ago,  a  large\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  the contribution to this improvement  was\r\n\r\nthe  result  of the utilisation of Scheme B  buses  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the City Shuttle Bus Service. Especially  in\r\n\r\nthe  housing estates like Telok Blangah, the  SBS  can\r\n\r\nimprove  its  services much more. But  understandably,\r\n\r\nperhaps   at  the  moment  they  cannot  do  so   and.\r\n\r\ntherefore, the complementary transport system provided\r\n\r\nby  the  Scheme B buses and the Shuttle Service  buses\r\n\r\nare commendable. But unfortunately some restriction is\r\n\r\nplaced on the Scheme B buses and the City Shuttle  Bus\r\n\r\nService  in  respect of the period in which  they  can\r\n\r\noperate.  I  do  appreciate that Scheme  B  buses  are\r\n\r\nmainly  meant for transporting school children to  and\r\n\r\nfrom schools. In spite of this there are other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperiods  in  which  they can be much  more  profitably\r\n\r\nused,  especially in housing estates where the SBS  is\r\n\r\nnot in a position to provide the sort of service which\r\n\r\nthe  residents expect. The Registry of Vehicles should\r\n\r\nbe  more flexible and allow the Scheme B buses and the\r\n\r\nCity  Shuttle Bus Service to operate even  beyond  the\r\n\r\ntime that they are allowed at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  order to ameliorate the traffic problem  the\r\n\r\nROV  has  placed more and more restrictions on private\r\n\r\nmotor cars and, as a result, public transport vehicles\r\n\r\nwill  now play an increasingly important role. On many\r\n\r\noccasions the ROV has emphasised this fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what is baffling is that although the ROV\r\n\r\nhas  emphasised  the  importance of  public  transport\r\n\r\nvehicles, it has imposed restrictive measures on taxis\r\n\r\n-  an  important  link in public transport  which  are\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the  principles  mentioned  above.  With\r\n\r\nregard  to surcharge on taxis, it was raised from  25%\r\n\r\nin  1972 to 55% in 1974. It has now been raised  to  1\r\n\r\n00%. What difference is there between private cars and\r\n\r\ntaxis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of the ROV is to encourage more people to\r\n\r\nuse  public  transport.  But the  ROV  has,  in  fact,\r\n\r\napplied  to  taxis  the  same  measures  used  against\r\n\r\nprivate cars. Does it mean that taxis are not regarded\r\n\r\nas  public transport vehicles? The ROy levies  an  ALS\r\n\r\nfee which was originally $3 but subsequently raised to\r\n\r\n$4  a  day  on  private cars entering CBD  during  the\r\n\r\nmorning  peak hours. Now this measure is also  applied\r\n\r\nto  taxis. The purpose of levying such fee on  private\r\n\r\ncars  is  to reduce the number of motor cars  entering\r\n\r\nthe  City area during such peak hours. But what is the\r\n\r\npurpose of imposing such measure on taxis? We  do  not\r\n\r\nquite  know. As we all know, when motorists and  their\r\n\r\nfellow  passengers forgo the use of  their  cans  when\r\n\r\nentering  the  CBD, they have of course to  depend  on\r\n\r\npublic   transport,  especially  taxis.  Under   these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, taxis, as a means for public transport,\r\n\r\nshould  be  actively encouraged to play  an  important\r\n\r\nrole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind Members that if they want\r\n\r\na reply, they must give the Minister time to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, do I understand that I will\r\n\r\nneed to say just two words and sit down?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As the Member pleases, if he wants a\r\n\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> I see.

The question raised  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Katong was on revenue from fines.  It  is\r\n\r\ntrue  that the revenue from fines has increased. This\r\n\r\nis   mainly  due  to  three  factors.  Firstly,  more\r\n\r\ndeterrents  and  higher composition fines  have  been\r\n\r\nintroduced.  Secondly, with the introduction  of  the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Ticketing System since March last  year,  it\r\n\r\nhas  enabled  traffic  reports  to  be  settled  more\r\n\r\nquickly  than  before. Thirdly, increased  efficiency\r\n\r\nand the setting up of the Traffic Law Enforcement  by\r\n\r\nthe  Traffic  Police resulted in an increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber of traffic offences reported. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber  of  traffic offences reported  has  increased\r\n\r\nfrom 121,648 in 1972 to 191.989 last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards road accidents, there has, in fact, been\r\n\r\na  decrease  in  road accidents. There were  slightly\r\n\r\nmore  than  36.000 accidents in 1972. But the  number\r\n\r\nhas  dropped to 31,506 in 1974 and 28,919 last  year.\r\n\r\nThis is also the result of the various measures taken\r\n\r\nto  reduce road accidents, most notably the selective\r\n\r\nenforcement policy, the points demerit system and the\r\n\r\nenhancement  of  punishment  for  traffic  offenders.\r\n\r\nLastly there was the education campaign conducted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  to  cultivate  good\r\n\r\ndriving habits among motorists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has raised the question\r\n\r\nof  bus service in the new towns. As he will realise,\r\n\r\nduring  the transition period where people  are  just\r\n\r\nstarting to move in, it is not practical to provide a\r\n\r\nfull  public transport service in these new towns.  I\r\n\r\nwould agree with him that perhaps some Scheme B buses\r\n\r\nor  the  City Shuttle Service buses can be introduced\r\n\r\ninto  the  new  towns.  This would  again  depend  on\r\n\r\nwhether the operators are keen to operate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N.

To advance\r\n\r\nthe  hours from 7.30 am, to before 7.30 am., no.  But\r\n\r\nto  extend the Scheme B bus service after 9.30 am, is\r\n\r\na  question  of  demand  and  the  viability  of  the\r\n\r\nservice.
