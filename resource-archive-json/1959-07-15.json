It leaves the detailed  forms\r\n\r\nof  financial control, however, to be  provided  by\r\n\r\nlaw.  The provisions of these sections of the Order\r\n\r\nin  Council  come into operation on  the  appointed\r\n\r\nday.  It  is  therefore necessary that  the  former\r\n\r\nfinancial   procedure  for  accounting   based   on\r\n\r\nColonial Regulations and General Orders, which  are\r\n\r\nnow obsolete, should be replaced by new provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Constitution will effect certain changes\r\n\r\nin  procedures and introduce new ones. For example,\r\n\r\nthe terms of the Order in Council are such that  it\r\n\r\nwill  not  be possible to continue the practice  of\r\n\r\nBelow-the-Line Advance Accounts, financed from cash\r\n\r\nbalances  without a vote. These have hitherto  been\r\n\r\nextensively  used for trading and working  accounts\r\n\r\ninvolving suspense payments. Again, section  99  of\r\n\r\nthe  Order in Council creates a Contingencies  Fund\r\n\r\nwhich  will be a new and useful method for  meeting\r\n\r\nurgent  and  unforeseen  needs.  These  and   other\r\n\r\nchanges  in  procedures will  be  effected  by  the\r\n\r\nFinancial Procedure Bill now before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in the Preamble, the Bill will\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the  control and  management  of  the\r\n\r\npublic finances of the State of Singapore, and  for\r\n\r\nfinancial   and  accounting  procedure,   including\r\n\r\nprocedure  for the collection, custody and  payment\r\n\r\nof the public moneys of the State of Singapore, and\r\n\r\nthe   purchase,  custody  and  disposal  of  public\r\n\r\nproperty,  other  than  land,  of  the   State   of\r\n\r\nSingapore and for matters connected therewith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanatory statement sets out in simple form\r\n\r\nthe effect of the various clauses of this Bill, and\r\n\r\nI therefore do not propose to enlarge at this stage\r\n\r\nupon this explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is complementary to the Audit Bill,\r\n\r\nwhich has had its First.

P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nI rise to speak on the general merits of the Bill,\r\n\r\nand in doing so, I would like to touch particularly\r\n\r\nupon clauses 17 and 19 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 17 refers to the Audit\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1959, and the provisions of clause 17 of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill seem to hinge on section 9 of the  Audit\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1959.  As  the  House  is  aware,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  proposes to take this Bill through  all\r\n\r\nits  stages  this  morning, this day.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Law might indicate whether  there  is\r\n\r\nsuch  an  Ordinance known as the  Audit  Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1959, on the statute book because, if there is not,\r\n\r\nit seems to me that clause 17 is quite meaningless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, clause 19, Mr Speaker, Sir, proposes a new\r\n\r\nmethod  of  dealing  with  defalcations  of  public\r\n\r\nservants   or  negligences  committed   by   public\r\n\r\nservants  with regard to public property or  public\r\n\r\nfinance.   I  have  nothing  to  say  against   the\r\n\r\nprinciple of surcharging public servants,  but  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  the  manner in which it  is  proposed  to\r\n\r\nbring home the surcharges to public servants as set\r\n\r\nout in this Bill is, to say the least, very drastic\r\n\r\nand  most unfair. The Bill proposes that if certain\r\n\r\nevents  do occur, then the Treasury calls upon  the\r\n\r\noffending  public  servant to give  a  satisfactory\r\n\r\nexplanation.  The  \"Treasury\", as  defined  in  the\r\n\r\ndefining clause, is the Minister himself,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  position is - and the Minister here, I take  it,\r\n\r\nis the Finance Minister - that when a public servant\r\n\r\nhas  infringed the provisions of clause 19 (a),  19\r\n\r\n(b)  or 19 (c), the Minister for Finance calls upon\r\n\r\nthe  public  servant  to give  him  a  satisfactory\r\n\r\nexplanation  within  a  period  specified  by   the\r\n\r\nTreasury - which again is the Minister himself - and if\r\n\r\nsuch a satisfactory explanation is not furnished to\r\n\r\nthe Minister - who is again the Finance Minister - then\r\n\r\nthe  Minister may advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nto surcharge the said person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution being what it is today, any\r\n\r\nadvice  tendered  by the Finance Minister  must  be\r\n\r\naccepted by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara and he  must\r\n\r\nact  on it. So we reach the position, if clause  19\r\n\r\nis  accepted  by the House, that the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance is both the policeman, the prosecutor,  the\r\n\r\njudge and the jury - a state of affairs which I think\r\n\r\nthe House will agree is undesirable if we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndesire  to  maintain  a public  service  which  has\r\n\r\nconfidence and faith in the Government.  And  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  any  Government which bases  itself  on\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy would wish to  destroy  the\r\n\r\nmorale  of  its  public  servants.  Therefore,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, at the appropriate time I shall  move\r\n\r\nan  amendment to seek to rectify what I consider an\r\n\r\nundesirable position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Mr Speaker, on which I wish to\r\n\r\naddress the House, appears in line 22 of clause 19,\r\n\r\nwhich  says  \"the  original value of  the  property\r\n\r\ndestroyed\".  I think it should not be the  original\r\n\r\nvalue.

In my experience, the most important  thing\r\n\r\nis  to see that the public finance of the State  is\r\n\r\nbeing properly audited, to have a proper system  of\r\n\r\naccounts   instituted   by   Government,   and    a\r\n\r\nstrengthening of the Audit Department.  Clause  17,\r\n\r\nas   far  as  the  law  is  concerned,  gives   the\r\n\r\nLegislature  enough power to check  on  the  public\r\n\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Member for Farrer Park has\r\n\r\nexaggerated what is laid down in clause 19 of  this\r\n\r\nBill. The purpose of clause 19, as I see it, is  to\r\n\r\nprotect   the   funds  of  the  people   from   any\r\n\r\nmisappropriation or any loss due to the  negligence\r\n\r\nof  certain  members of the public  service.  Those\r\n\r\nmembers of the public service who have done a  good\r\n\r\njob  need  have no fear. I remember  in  the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ordinance,  which  was  passed  in  the\r\n\r\nprevious Legislative Assembly,  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat there is also a clause which entitles\r\n\r\nthe  City Council - and I think the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  has much experience there - to deduct from  the\r\n\r\nprovident  fund of any member of the staff  of  the\r\n\r\nCity Council who has misappropriated funds, or  who\r\n\r\nhas  caused  a  loss of public  money  due  to  his\r\n\r\nnegligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  shall be the jury, the prosecutor and  the\r\n\r\njudge,  because, as it stands, there will be checks\r\n\r\ninside  a  democratic framework which Will  prevent\r\n\r\nthe  Civil  Service,  or any member  of  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService, from being unduly brought to bear  on  any\r\n\r\nloss of public money. I am sure that the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  will know that if any member  of  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Service  is  to  pay  up  money  which   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has decided that he should pay  back  to\r\n\r\nthe  public  funds, there is always the  resort  of\r\n\r\ngoing  to  the  courts of law; and in a  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem,  so  long  as  the  independence   of   the\r\n\r\njudiciary  is being protected, I see  there  is  no\r\n\r\nundue  encroachment  on a responsible,  honest  and\r\n\r\nefficient civil servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.47 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, within my experience of\r\n\r\nGovernment  which has extended over many  years,  I\r\n\r\ncan  assure  the  House that it is  not  the  usual\r\n\r\npractice  to  institute, say, judicial  proceedings\r\n\r\nagainst officials when it is established that funds\r\n\r\nproperly  belonging  to the  State  have  not  been\r\n\r\ncarefully accounted for by the officials concerned.\r\n\r\nWhenever  it  is  found  that  there  has  been   a\r\n\r\nmisappropriation    or   misapplication    or    an\r\n\r\nunaccountable  loss  of public property  or  public\r\n\r\nfunds,  the  usual  practice is  for  the  head  of\r\n\r\ndepartment concerned to make a report to the  Audit\r\n\r\nDepartment,  and the Audit Department then  in  its\r\n\r\nexecutive function proceeds to make a full enquiry.\r\n\r\nAfter  that, the matter is reported to the head  of\r\n\r\ndepartment and it is then up to him, after  getting\r\n\r\nan explanation from the person concerned, to decide\r\n\r\nwhether  that person is to be surcharged with  that\r\n\r\nloss.  There  is  no  question  of  there  being  a\r\n\r\njudicial  inquiry into such matters. In  this,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  we are not in any way departing from  the\r\n\r\nusual procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the procedure indicated in clause 19, it is\r\n\r\nquite  clear  that  it  is the  Minister  who  will\r\n\r\ninitiate action when it is brought home to him that\r\n\r\nthere  are  defalcations and  misappropriations  or\r\n\r\nmisapplications of public funds or public property.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry is made if a satisfactory explanation is\r\n\r\nnot  given. Then he takes the matter up. He advises\r\n\r\nthe  Yang di-Pertuan Negara to surcharge the person\r\n\r\nwith the whole or such proportion of the amount  as\r\n\r\nis unaccounted for. That is the usual procedure. So\r\n\r\nI do ask the House to disregard what the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  has said. He has suggested  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   trying  to  introduce   a   novel\r\n\r\nprocedure - a  procedure that is  not  in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  democratic  practices. I would  suggest,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  that there is no substance  in  what  the\r\n\r\nhon.

The first is a technical  one,  namely,\r\n\r\nthat  clause  17 of this Bill refers  to  an  Audit\r\n\r\nOrdinance which does not exist and, to that extent,\r\n\r\nthis  clause  of the Financial Procedure  Bill  may\r\n\r\nappear  somewhat  nonsensical.  May  I  refer   the\r\n\r\nlearned Member for Farrer Park to clause 1  (2)  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  which  provides that \"The  Minister  may\r\n\r\nappoint   different  dates  for  the  coming   into\r\n\r\noperation   of   different   provisions   of   this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, it is clearly an\r\n\r\nelementary  matter  to hold up the  enforcement  of\r\n\r\nclause 17 until the Audit Bill has become law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second point is that clause 19 concentrates\r\n\r\ntoo  much  powers  on  the Minister  in  charge  of\r\n\r\nfinance  in  the civil service. Sir, the  power  to\r\n\r\nsurcharge   civil   servants   found   guilty    of\r\n\r\ncarelessness or defalcation of funds is not, as  my\r\n\r\ncolleague  the  Minister for  Labour  and  Law  has\r\n\r\npointed   out,  a  new  introduction  in  financial\r\n\r\nprocedure in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised that the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nraised objections to the granting of such powers to\r\n\r\nan elected Minister of the country, while he had no\r\n\r\nsuch objections in regard to powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nformerly   held  by  the  Financial  Secretary   to\r\n\r\nsurcharge  negligent public servants.

I felt that\r\n\r\none  of the defects of the Municipal Ordinance  was\r\n\r\nthat  it  did not have provision in that  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhereby the neglect of Municipal servants could  be\r\n\r\nsurcharged.   When  the  Municipal  Ordinance   was\r\n\r\namended  and the Local Government Ordinance,  1957,\r\n\r\nwas  brought  into force and for some  considerable\r\n\r\ntime  prior to that while the Ordinance  was  being\r\n\r\nconsidered by the City Council, I was in charge  of\r\n\r\nthat  Bill  on the City Council and I might  inform\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for National Development that it  was\r\n\r\non  my  suggestion that that provision was inserted\r\n\r\nin the Local Government Ordinance, 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make my position quite clear - that I am\r\n\r\nnot  quarrelling with the principle that  a  public\r\n\r\nservant  should be surcharged for his misdeeds.  It\r\n\r\nis  only  right  and proper that it  should  be  so\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is dealing with public funds.  But  my\r\n\r\nquarrel  with this clause of the Bill  is  not  the\r\n\r\nsurcharging of the public servant but the manner in\r\n\r\nwhich the surcharge is sought to be brought about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, public servants, Mr Speaker, are an\r\n\r\nimportant  category of persons  in  our  system  of\r\n\r\ngovernment and they should be given every  possible\r\n\r\nprotection. I do not say that they should be molly-coddled  and pampered like some of the  past  civil\r\n\r\nservants  were, but they should be made to  realise\r\n\r\ntheir proper position in society as we now know it,\r\n\r\nand  they should be given proper protection in  the\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  their functions. That is  the  first\r\n\r\npoint I would like to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is I think the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  is  the head of the civil service,  or  at\r\n\r\nleast  he  is  in control of the civil service, it\r\n\r\nwould  place  the Minister himself, I beg  to  tell\r\n\r\nhim,  in the most invidious position where  he  has\r\n\r\ngot   to   investigate  the  defalcation   or   the\r\n\r\nmisappropriation  of public funds,  call  for  the\r\n\r\nindividual  servant for a satisfactory explanation,\r\n\r\nsit in judgment over it and then advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  merely is the constitutional hand that imposes\r\n\r\nthe   surcharge,  but  the  real  hand  behind  the\r\n\r\nsurcharge  is  the Minister himself.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  if I were the Minister for Finance, I  should\r\n\r\nhate  to  be  placed in that position.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nmerely  a  question  of giving the  public  servant\r\n\r\nadequate  protection  but it  is  also  giving  the\r\n\r\nMinister   himself   adequate  protection   against\r\n\r\nplacing himself in such an untenable position where\r\n\r\nhe calls for an explanation from the public servant\r\n\r\nconcerned and proceeds to take action himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If hon. Members of the House will turn to the\r\n\r\nExplanatory  Statement  on page  12,  paragraph  16\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Clauses 19 to 22 provide for the levy and\r\n\r\nenforcement  of  surcharges  against   any   public\r\n\r\nservant  who  has  been  guilty  of  misconduct  or\r\n\r\nnegligence...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Might I repeat the phrase again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...who has been guilty of misconduct or\r\n\r\nnegligence which has occasioned the loss of  moneys\r\n\r\nor stores, or overpayments of moneys, or failure to\r\n\r\ncollect  moneys  duly  payable  to  the  State   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Quite a proper explanation: quite the proper thing.\r\n\r\nBut  the  Bill itself, I regret. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\ndoes  not  bring  out  the  intention  set  out  in\r\n\r\nparagraph  16  which appears  on  page  12  of  the\r\n\r\nExplanatory Statement. It is the misconduct or  the\r\n\r\nnegligence of the public servant that must occasion\r\n\r\nthe  loss of the moneys. Now, does clause 19  bring\r\n\r\nthat  out, Mr Speaker, Sir? I beg to suggest  that\r\n\r\nit does not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a Public Service Commission here, the\r\n\r\nMembers  of whom have been recently appointed.  The\r\n\r\nfunction of the Public Service Commission  is  two-fold.  First  of  all, to appoint  public  servants\r\n\r\nwithout  fear or favour, and those public  servants\r\n\r\nhaving  been so appointed should hold their offices\r\n\r\nwithout  fear or favour and without any  danger  of\r\n\r\nbeing  victimised  by  a  particular  Minister   or\r\n\r\nsomebody  over  him.  It was for  that  intent  and\r\n\r\npurpose  that  the  Public Service  Commission  was\r\n\r\ncreated. We have that body. Why do we not make  use\r\n\r\nof  that body? It costs the Government nothing.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance or a departmental  head\r\n\r\nfinds that there has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefalcation,  he merely reports the matter  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned.  The Minister  concerned  then\r\n\r\nreports it to the Public Service Commission  which,\r\n\r\nI  take  it,  has its own machinery to  make  these\r\n\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I ask this House is to accept this, not that\r\n\r\nsurcharges  should  be  dispensed  with  but   that\r\n\r\nsurcharges  should be strictly adhered to.  But  in\r\n\r\nsurcharging the officer, because the matter  is  so\r\n\r\nserious  to  the officer concerned, I think  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  that  not  only  the  officer  but   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance should himself be  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat perhaps he has not made a mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That the words proposed to be\r\n\r\nleft out, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Hon.

Friend to section\r\n\r\n81  (1)  of the Singapore (Constitution)  Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil where it is stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Subject to the provisions of this Order, the\r\n\r\nappointment (other than an appointment to act in an\r\n\r\noffice for two months or less), promotion, transfer\r\n\r\nfrom  one Division or Service or from one class  or\r\n\r\ngrade   to  another,  termination  of  appointment,\r\n\r\ndismissal and disciplinary control of every  public\r\n\r\nofficer  is  hereby vested in the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara acting in accordance with the advice of  the\r\n\r\nCommission.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the question of a surcharge against any public officer for any misappropriation or\r\n\r\ndefalcation of public funds or public properties is\r\n\r\nnot a matter which concerns the discipline of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan   officer.   It  is  just  ordinary   accounting\r\n\r\npractice: if it is found that the officer concerned\r\n\r\nis  accountable for that loss, I would submit, with\r\n\r\nrespect,  that it is the duty of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance to see that that loss is properly accounted\r\n\r\nfor.  The  question of discipline  is  an  entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent  matter.  Should  it  be  found  that  an\r\n\r\nofficer,  through his negligence, merits dismissal,\r\n\r\nthen  the  procedure  will be  through  the  Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission.  I  have  no  doubt  that   my\r\n\r\ncolleague the Minister for Finance, who has been in\r\n\r\nthe   civil   service  with  me  for  many   years,\r\n\r\nunderstands that practice. If it is found  that  an\r\n\r\nofficer  should be surcharged and if  it  is  found\r\n\r\nthat  although he has been negligent he has been  a\r\n\r\ngood  officer and that the Government does not wish\r\n\r\nto  take  any disciplinary proceedings against  him\r\n\r\nfor  that loss, then he will be only surcharged for\r\n\r\nthat  loss.  But  if it is found that  his  conduct\r\n\r\nmerits more than a surcharge, then I have no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister for Finance will see  that  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  disciplinary proceedings are  instituted\r\n\r\nagainst that officer. I have no doubt that he  will\r\n\r\nthen   have   recourse   to  the   Public   Service\r\n\r\nCommission,  because it will be the Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission  that will be the proper organ  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith cases of indiscipline in the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I again refer\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Law to the  clause  in\r\n\r\nthe Objects and Reasons on page 12?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Objects and Reasons are out of\r\n\r\ndate.

The loss should stem\r\n\r\nfrom  negligence or misconduct. If  there  was  any\r\n\r\nloss   which  did  not  stem  from  negligence   or\r\n\r\nmisconduct, clause 19 does not apply, according  to\r\n\r\nthe Explanatory Note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, negligence and misconduct are matters of\r\n\r\ndiscipline  in  any  system of government.

According   to   the\r\n\r\nExplanatory  Statement, it is not the intention  of\r\n\r\nGovernment to surcharge a public servant every time\r\n\r\nloss  occurs  but  only when such loss  stems  from\r\n\r\nnegligence  or  misconduct, which  are  matters  of\r\n\r\ndiscipline or could be matters of discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.15 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I think the proposal\r\n\r\nbefore the House now is that the words,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"if a satisfactory explanation is not, within a\r\n\r\nperiod specified by the Treasury, furnished to  the\r\n\r\nMinister\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>be  left out, and that they be substituted with the\r\n\r\nwords  indicated  by  my  hon.

I  am  only\r\n\r\nconcerned with that proposal, and it is quite clear\r\n\r\nthat  it is very necessary that those words  should\r\n\r\nbe included in the text of Clause 19, because it is\r\n\r\nthe Minister who will have to satisfy himself as to\r\n\r\nthe reasons for the loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already indicated just now, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthat  it  would be quite improper for the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance to abdicate those functions of enquiry\r\n\r\nto  an  extraneous  body like  the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission, when the question at issue is a loss of\r\n\r\npublic funds and public property.

In  order  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on  business, the Minister for  Finance,  as\r\n\r\nManager,   will   engage   many   accountants   and\r\n\r\nstorekeepers. One of these storekeepers  was  found\r\n\r\nout -  that instead of 10 cases of beer, there  were\r\n\r\nonly  five cases in stock. I am sure, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthat  it is the duty of the Manager, and not  of  a\r\n\r\njudge,  to  go and claim the 5 cases of beer  lost.\r\n\r\nWhy has this to be done? Why have clause 19 and the\r\n\r\nwhole  idea of the Financial Procedure Bill, to  be\r\n\r\npushed  through?

But, at first, today, it did  not\r\n\r\noccur  to  me, nor do I see, anything in clause  19\r\n\r\nwhich  could be said to be a matter that can  cause\r\n\r\nfear to those who are in or who are serving in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we really truly love our responsibilities,\r\n\r\nthen  there  is not a thing, I find, in  clause  19\r\n\r\nwhich  gives  the Minister power whereby  he  could\r\n\r\nthreaten or victimise people who, as I said, truly\r\n\r\nwish to serve loyally for the benefit of the people\r\n\r\nand of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to emphasize that we, on the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  particularly speaking, for  myself,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to state that whatever is good we  will\r\n\r\nsurely  support.  But we are not  happy  because  a\r\n\r\nwhile ago, I myself was surprised to see that  when\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister rose to speak, it appeared  as\r\n\r\nthough  the Prime Minister wanted to pounce on  the\r\n\r\nOpposition Members - not all perhaps - but it certainly\r\n\r\nappeared  as  though the Prime Minister  wanted  to\r\n\r\npounce  on  and to devour the eight of us including\r\n\r\nme myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we the Opposition will always co-operate and\r\n\r\ngive  due  consideration to  whatever  is  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the country, but not with the object  of\r\n\r\nbenefiting  a political party or those in  sympathy\r\n\r\nwith any political party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what we wish to emphasize, because our\r\n\r\nduty  is  to develop the country; and for  national\r\n\r\ndevelopment we need money and it is our duty to see\r\n\r\nthat every officer to whom we have entrusted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npower,  should safeguard the property of the public\r\n\r\nand  of  the country, so that we would be  able  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out whatever is deemed appropriate  for  our\r\n\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, clearly, I do not wish to say that I do not\r\n\r\ncompletely agree with what is in this clause.

Now,\r\n\r\nif  the  property destroyed is, in fact,  destroyed\r\n\r\nthree  or  four years after purchase, the value  of\r\n\r\nthe   property  would  have  gone  down.  In  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  would  it be  fair  to  charge  the\r\n\r\nofficer  with  the original value? I take  it  that\r\n\r\nthere is no intention on the part of the Government\r\n\r\nto  make a profit on this surcharge, but merely  to\r\n\r\nrecover whatever actual loss Government might  have\r\n\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I oppose the\r\n\r\namendment.

Mr Speaker, we have gone down to  the\r\n\r\npeople,  to  absorb the Local Government operatives\r\n\r\nof  Singapore within the framework of  the  central\r\n\r\ngovernment.  It  was  one  of  the  planks  in  our\r\n\r\nelection platform. We come today in order to  carry\r\n\r\nout  that plank. During the first week of June, the\r\n\r\nby-elections  of  the City Council  were  suspended\r\n\r\nand,  at  the same time, the functions of the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  which were not taken over by the  previous\r\n\r\nMinister  for Local Government were transferred  to\r\n\r\nmyself  as  Minister for National  Development,  by\r\n\r\norder,   namely  the  City  Council  (Transfer   of\r\n\r\nFunctions)  Order,  1959. The present  position  is\r\n\r\nthat we have 16 Councillors, who exist in name  but\r\n\r\nwho have no functions to play. We have decided that\r\n\r\nthey  shall  not get any allowance since  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  (Transfer of Functions) Order,  1959,  was\r\n\r\npromulgated.  By this Bill, the City Council  shall\r\n\r\ncease   to   have  responsibility  for  the   local\r\n\r\ngovernment  of  the City and the Council  shall  be\r\n\r\ndeemed  to  have retired on the date of the  coming\r\n\r\ninto  operation of this Bill. Clause 6 of the  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  enable  myself, as the Minister for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  to  exercise the  functions,  duties,\r\n\r\ndiscretions  and authorities normally exercised  by\r\n\r\nthe City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.50 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on\r\n\r\nthe principle involved in this Bill. It is this: Is\r\n\r\nthe  present  Government  interested  in  fostering\r\n\r\ndemocracy in this country and therefore supporting \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand fostering democratic institutions which\r\n\r\nbuild  up  to the apex of parliamentary government,\r\n\r\nor  is the present Government merely interested  in\r\n\r\nconcentrating all the powers of Government into the\r\n\r\nhands  of  seven  or nine individuals  and  thereby\r\n\r\nmaking  it easy for the time to be reached  in  our\r\n\r\nhistory  when  the  power  in  the  nine  could  be\r\n\r\nconcentrated  into  one to merge  into  a  national\r\n\r\ndictatorship?  It seems to me that  the  signs  are\r\n\r\nthat  the present Government is only interested  in\r\n\r\ncentering  unto itself all the powers of Government\r\n\r\nwhich  previously  had been distributed  into  this\r\n\r\ngroup, that group and the other in order that these\r\n\r\ngroups   themselves   would   understand   what   a\r\n\r\nparliamentary   government   is    and    what    a\r\n\r\nparliamentary institution is and what a  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  is.  In  no  country,  Mr  Speaker,  where\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy prevails, has  the  central\r\n\r\ngovernment  abolished a system of local government.\r\n\r\nThe   lifeblood  of  a  parliamentary   system   of\r\n\r\ngovernment  comes from the local people  themselves\r\n\r\nwho  govern  their own affairs in their  own  small\r\n\r\nway. A licence for a hawker, a licence for a market\r\n\r\nstall, might be a very small matter to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National  Development  when  he  has  so  many\r\n\r\ndepartments under his control - half of Singapore  is\r\n\r\nunder  the  control  of the Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.  In  these  circumstances,  who  could\r\n\r\nblame  him  if he is not bothered about a  hawker's\r\n\r\nlicence  or  a  stallholder's licence,  which,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  are  important matters  in  the  life  of\r\n\r\ncertain people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, is it not fair and proper that some time\r\n\r\nshould be spent over people like them, rather  than\r\n\r\nthat they be brushed aside by bureaucratic methods?\r\n\r\nIs  the Minister for National Development trying to\r\n\r\ntell this House that he can adjudicate on all these\r\n\r\nclaims  himself, or will he be completely dependent\r\n\r\non  his  civil servants? If not his civil servants,\r\n\r\nthen  those sitting near him beside him and  behind\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Mr Speaker, if we are interested in\r\n\r\nfostering  a parliamentary democracy, it  is  vital\r\n\r\nthat   the   country  should  also   foster   local\r\n\r\ninstitutions which govern in a democratic  way.  It\r\n\r\nis no use telling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis House that all the Government is interested in\r\n\r\nis  efficiency.  Efficiency is  not  everything  in\r\n\r\none's  life. If you want efficiency there are other\r\n\r\nsystems of government which we could go to. In  any\r\n\r\nevent,  what  does this Bill mean? It merely  means\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister for National Development  takes\r\n\r\nover  all  the  functions of the City Council.  The\r\n\r\nCity Council as a statutory corporation, I take it,\r\n\r\nstill remains intact. That is not tampered with.  I\r\n\r\nthink the more logical thing, Mr Speaker, would be\r\n\r\nto have the whole of the Local Government Ordinance\r\n\r\nrepealed and whatever functions the City Council or\r\n\r\nother  local authorities have under that  Ordinance\r\n\r\nbe  transferred to the Government. Let us get  back\r\n\r\nto  the original state of Singapore when Government\r\n\r\nwas the apex and point of all Government functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that what we are getting back to? Are we\r\n\r\ngetting  back  to 120 years ago instead  of  moving\r\n\r\nforward  and trying to decentralise? Are we  trying\r\n\r\nto   centralise  everything  in  that  seven-storey\r\n\r\nbuilding  at  Upper Pickering Street?  Many  people\r\n\r\nhave  fallen to death from that place. I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development has not taken too\r\n\r\nmuch on his plate. I hope he will still be with  us\r\n\r\nat the end of his five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.57 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I think I may remind the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer Park that we are  springing  no\r\n\r\nsurprise on the people of Singapore. We have in our\r\n\r\npublication   \"The   Tasks  Ahead\",   even   before\r\n\r\nNomination Day explained to the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwhat were the policies we intended to implement  if\r\n\r\nwith their support we became the government of this\r\n\r\nterritory. We have explained, Mr Speaker, that  it\r\n\r\nwas quite impossible, in a territory which measures\r\n\r\nonly  about  220 square miles, to have  in  it  two\r\n\r\ngovernments, two administrations competing side  by\r\n\r\nside  in  a  territory which is  so  small  in  its\r\n\r\nextent, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We traced the history of municipal governments in\r\n\r\nSingapore in our publication  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Tasks Ahead\". There were, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nin  the  past,  two rival administrations  in  this\r\n\r\nterritory.  One  was  the  Colony  of  the  Straits\r\n\r\nSettlements  and the other was the Federated  Malay\r\n\r\nStates.   You   will  find  that   in   these   two\r\n\r\nadministrations  at one time in our  history  there\r\n\r\nwere  a Governor of the Straits Settlements  and  a\r\n\r\nHigh  Commissioner of the Federated  Malay  States.\r\n\r\nThose  were Colonial administrations no doubt,  and\r\n\r\nthey  were  unified by the Head of State.  At  that\r\n\r\ntime,  Mr Speaker, I think you will remember,  and\r\n\r\nmany  of  us  here will remember, that  there  were\r\n\r\nseparate settlements in Penang, in Malacca  and  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. The Colonial Secretary was in charge  of\r\n\r\nthe Settlement of Singapore and there were resident\r\n\r\ncounsellors  in  Penang and in  Malacca.  The  same\r\n\r\npattern  of  Government obtained in the territories\r\n\r\nof  the  Federated Malay States. There were British\r\n\r\nresidents in those territories, and above all these\r\n\r\nat   the  apex  were  the  Governor  and  the  High\r\n\r\nCommissioner.  Now in that set-up, it  was  natural\r\n\r\nthat  you  did  foster local government.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthere  was a time in the history of Singapore where\r\n\r\nyou did have, say, an elected City Council, and for\r\n\r\nsome  reason  or  other, way back in  1879  to  the\r\n\r\n1880's,  the Singapore Municipal Council ceased  to\r\n\r\nbe an elected body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with the liberation after the Japanese\r\n\r\noccupation   of  this  country,  the   pattern   of\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  changed. You had  then  a  Malayan\r\n\r\nUnion which was, in fact, a British Crown Colony of\r\n\r\nwhat  was  the  Federated  Malay  States  and   the\r\n\r\nUnfederated  Malay  States. And  then  you  have  a\r\n\r\nseparate  Colony of Singapore. I will not  go  into\r\n\r\nthe  details of recent history. It is known to  you\r\n\r\nall, that the idea of a Malayan Union, the idea  of\r\n\r\na  Crown  Colony of the Federated Malay States  and\r\n\r\nthe Unfederated Malay States was not acceptable  to\r\n\r\nMalay  opinion  upcountry.  For  that  reason,  the\r\n\r\nAdministration  there  was  transformed  into   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, which has since given way  to\r\n\r\nthe present situation in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, we also have marched on the road to\r\n\r\nself-government and eventually \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the road of merger with the Federation in\r\n\r\none sovereign independent State of Malaya. Now,  in\r\n\r\nthat situation, Mr Speaker, you have seen what had\r\n\r\nhappened in the City Council in the past two  years\r\n\r\nbefore   the   P.A.P. became  the  Government   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   You  could  see,  Mr  Speaker,   that\r\n\r\nparliamentary  forms were completely abused.  There\r\n\r\nwas  no  government  in  the  City  Council  as  we\r\n\r\nunderstand it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the colonial system it was possible for\r\n\r\nmatters to be managed and for some semblance  of  a\r\n\r\ngovernment to be in the City Council, but that  was\r\n\r\nnot  a  situation  which obtained when  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbecame  a majority party in the City Council.  Then\r\n\r\nagain we have asserted in our manifesto, \"The Tasks\r\n\r\nAhead\", that we as a Government, we the P.A.P. as a\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore, believe in efficiency, and\r\n\r\nwe  want  the cost of administration to be reduced.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to everybody in Singapore that the\r\n\r\nfunctions of Government are distributed between the\r\n\r\ncentral  Government, the City Council,  the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nand other quasi-Government bodies and agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that leads to a tremendous duplication of\r\n\r\neffort. It leads to a considerable waste of  public\r\n\r\nfunds  and waste of public time if you want to  get\r\n\r\non  with the work you have in mind. We are no  more\r\n\r\nin  the  period  when we can afford  waste  in  the\r\n\r\nsystem  of Government. There is no reason why  they\r\n\r\nshould  vie  with one another. There is  no  reason\r\n\r\nwhy,  for  instance, there should be a Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth and also a Department of Health in the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil duplicating all the functions all the  way.\r\n\r\nThere   is  no  reason  why  there  should  be   an\r\n\r\nEngineers'  Department in the City  Council  and  a\r\n\r\nseparate P.W.D. for the central Government. It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  known  that  each department  tended  not  to\r\n\r\nregard  the interests of the community of Singapore\r\n\r\nbut  to  regard its own interests as paramount.  We\r\n\r\nhave  known  cases where there were idle  engineers\r\n\r\nand idle architects in the City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no means by which we could call upon\r\n\r\ntheir services to reinforce, say, the architectural\r\n\r\ndepartment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  the  engineers' department in the  P.W.D. when\r\n\r\nthey  were hard pressed. Now, that is a very simple\r\n\r\nillustration  of the things we have  in  mind.  All\r\n\r\nthat  leads  to  extra  cost.  All  that  leads  to\r\n\r\nfrustration  amongst  the  public  and  a  complete\r\n\r\nhatred of the present scheme of things. During  our\r\n\r\nelection  campaign, we had only to tell the  public\r\n\r\nof Singapore to just look at the situation that had\r\n\r\nbeen  produced by the energetic sense of  duty  and\r\n\r\nthe  excellent performance of our former  Mayor  in\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council. He could get things  done,  and\r\n\r\nthat  was  what  the members of the public  wanted.\r\n\r\nThey wanted things to be done. It was quite easy to\r\n\r\nget  their support. We had only to tell them, \"Look\r\n\r\nat  the situation before Ong Eng Guan was the Mayor\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. You queued outside the office of the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of Vehicles.\" You and I have  seen  them\r\n\r\nqueuing  up  day  after  day,  night  after  night,\r\n\r\nwhenever  they wanted to renew their  licences  and\r\n\r\nregistrations. All that ceased with  the  energetic\r\n\r\nwork  of  our former Mayor, Ong Eng Guan.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat  the  public  of  Singapore  want.  They  want\r\n\r\nefficiency and they want government. What  did  our\r\n\r\ncolleagues seated opposite me say? They were  going\r\n\r\nto give everything away to the people of Singapore:\r\n\r\nfree  this, free that. We had only to mention  that\r\n\r\non  our  platform and they just laughed in complete\r\n\r\nscorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, that is what we stand for. We\r\n\r\nstand  for  an  efficient, honest and incorruptible\r\n\r\nadministration.   We  do  not   believe   in   mere\r\n\r\nperformance. That is what our opponents believe in.\r\n\r\nIt  is  only under that scheme of things that  they\r\n\r\nare able to perform. We can perform because we have\r\n\r\nthe  support of the masses and because we know that\r\n\r\nwe  have  the will and the determination to  govern\r\n\r\nfor them in their interest and to do everything  we\r\n\r\ncan for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nwhen  debating  this  Bill  always  mentioned   the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  parliamentary democracy.

In fact, the people of Singapore require\r\n\r\na quick change to improve their life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  it is the second time  this  morning\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member for Farrer Park  stood  up  as  a\r\n\r\ndefender of parliamentary democracy.

Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nperhaps the Member for Farrer Park fails to realise\r\n\r\nthat  this Assembly has come into being as a result\r\n\r\nof  compulsory voting, and if anyone is to  be  the\r\n\r\ndefender  of  parliamentary democracy,  it  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that is in power today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seem to have been fears that, in the name\r\n\r\nof  efficiency, certain local authorities are to be\r\n\r\nscrapped.  Evidently, certain people  would  prefer\r\n\r\ninefficient  government, but this  Government  will\r\n\r\nnot  stand for it. We have made it quite  clear  in\r\n\r\nour  election  campaign that  we  shall  scrap  the\r\n\r\nduplication - perhaps the triplication - of work  in  a\r\n\r\nsmall island of 1\u00bd million people. If we think of\r\n\r\nthe  island  of  Singapore in the  context  of  the\r\n\r\nworld,  those  who  have  been  around  would  have\r\n\r\nlaughed  that a puny little island of 1\u00bd  million\r\n\r\npeople  has  got  so many bodies trying  to  govern\r\n\r\nwithin  themselves and ignoring the others.  So  in\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of efficient administration  and  of\r\n\r\nproducing   the  goods  to  the  people,   we   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wish to centralise. Centralism  can  be\r\n\r\ndangerous but with he overwhelming majority of  the\r\n\r\npeople behind this Government and the fact that  we\r\n\r\nare  grounded with the people and not away from the\r\n\r\npeople,   we   shall  maintain  true  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in the debate\r\n\r\nregarding the City Council (Suspension and Transfer\r\n\r\nof Functions) Bill, it seems that among the reasons\r\n\r\ngiven  by  Government  is the allegation  that  the\r\n\r\nprevious  power  was  a  colonial  power  and   was\r\n\r\ncorrupted: but what the Opposition side would  like\r\n\r\nto emphasise in this Bill is the true fact given by\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   for  Education   who   said   that\r\n\r\ncentralised power can bring disadvantages  to  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  In  this way, we would  like  to  make  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion   regarding  this  plan  so   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not spoil the fate of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  There  are  reasons  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot properly administer the State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in an orderly manner. We all  understand\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  previous  period was a period in  our  history\r\n\r\nwhich aimed at high ideals in administering our own\r\n\r\ncountry.  Now  we have just come to  the  stage  of\r\n\r\nholding  the  reins  of  government  fully  in  all\r\n\r\nmatters of administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be careful in a plan such as this. I am\r\n\r\nafraid  that this Government is trying to establish\r\n\r\na government - or, the democracy to be carried out in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  is  a  democracy in  the  form  of  the\r\n\r\nsuppression or the prevention of opinions which are\r\n\r\ncontrary to those of the government, because I have\r\n\r\nobserved the things which have been carried out  by\r\n\r\nthe    Ministry   of   National   Development    in\r\n\r\ninvestigating the conditions in places  which  they\r\n\r\nthought should be given every facility; they did so\r\n\r\nwithout  discussing  the matter  with  the  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives for those areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, I am the representative elected by\r\n\r\nthe  people of the Southern Islands, but  when  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   National  Development   wanted   to\r\n\r\ninvestigate the conditions or the weaknesses of the\r\n\r\nislanders,   the  Ministry  never   contacted   the\r\n\r\nrepresentative   of   that  area.   Is   this   the\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy which is uppermost  in  the\r\n\r\nminds of the Government? If it is our intention  to\r\n\r\nwork  together  to  build the State  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nmutual  respect should exist in this Assembly.  The\r\n\r\nOpposition  should  not  be  looked  upon  as   the\r\n\r\nremnants of colonialism. We are the representatives\r\n\r\nof  the people.

His concern, I must say,  warmed  the\r\n\r\ncockles of our hearts, at least even if it does not\r\n\r\nraise the temperature of this chilly Chamber a bit.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  would like to assure  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park that to express concern for the welfare\r\n\r\nof the proletariat in the Assembly, or be it in the\r\n\r\nCity  Council, is not enough. What the  proletariat\r\n\r\nis  more concerned is that action be taken on their\r\n\r\nbehalf, and my Party has never missed our work  and\r\n\r\nneither  have we been content to lead on our  words\r\n\r\nalone.  I  would assure the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nthat  our  taxi drivers, and our hawkers today  are\r\n\r\nhappier,  now that the P.A.P. is in the  Government\r\n\r\nthan  at  any time when the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nwas a Member of the City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to go into the technical details\r\n\r\nand reasons why we are proposing to absorb the City\r\n\r\nCouncil   into   the  functions  of   the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment. We have had several weeks of debate  on\r\n\r\nthis problem during the General Elections campaign,\r\n\r\nand the electorate was fully aware that this scheme\r\n\r\nof ours to absorb the City Council into the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment was part of our five-year plan. The fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. today has been returned  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  with an absolute majority would  show  that\r\n\r\nthey fully support this scheme of ours which we now\r\n\r\nformally propose in this Assembly to be regularised\r\n\r\nby an Ordinance. It will be tiring and wearisome if\r\n\r\nwe were to go again into the details of speeches we\r\n\r\nmade during the five weeks of electioneering, and I\r\n\r\ndo not propose to do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, the Member for Farrer Park showed a\r\n\r\nconsiderable    degree   of   preoccupation    with\r\n\r\ndictatorship. I am sorry that he has  an  obsession\r\n\r\non  dictatorships, but I would say that  there  are\r\n\r\ntwo  possible  solutions to this obsession - one,  to\r\n\r\nflee  the  country;  two, to  jump  down  from  the\r\n\r\nseventh  floor of the S.I.T. offices  in  Pickering\r\n\r\nStreet, as advocated by the Member for Farrer Park.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would say that this latter action  would\r\n\r\nbe, to say the least, most embarrassing because, on\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand,  someone on the Opposition  benches\r\n\r\nwould\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\nhave  to make an obituary speech and, on the  other\r\n\r\nhand, for us altogether we shall have to face a by-election.

I  am  surprised  when   I   see   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  stand, because I know when  I  was  a\r\n\r\nMinister  in the previous Government, we  formed  a\r\n\r\nCommittee on Local Government, on which the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwere   represented.   This  Committee   made   many\r\n\r\nproposals  which  were tabled in the  Assembly  and\r\n\r\nwere  accepted unanimously by the P.A.P. and  their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.  Besides,  in   1957,   the   then\r\n\r\nGovernment tabled a Bill on local government on the\r\n\r\nnumber  of assemblies - the City Council and District\r\n\r\nCouncils - which    were    agreed    to    by    the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the P.A.P. In addition to  that,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. also took a major part in the  general\r\n\r\nelections  in  1957  when  the  P.A.P. put  up  14\r\n\r\ncandidates.  Mr Speaker, I am surprised  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. took a decision about a month or two before\r\n\r\nthe   general  elections  to  abolish  the   policy\r\n\r\nconcerning the legislation or the policy  regarding\r\n\r\nlocal government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, the Government gave three reasons\r\n\r\nfor abolishing local government. The first concerns\r\n\r\nfinance;   the  second,  to  lessen  administrative\r\n\r\nproblems;    and    the   third,   to    centralise\r\n\r\nadministration. I would like to debate them one  by\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding finance, I do not know how we can\r\n\r\nreduce  it. If we want to consider the expenses  of\r\n\r\nthe representatives - $200 each per month, the Mayor,\r\n\r\n$1,000  per  month -  I estimate that  approximately\r\n\r\n$90,000  will be scent every year. In  my  opinion,\r\n\r\nthe $90,000 per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nannum  spent is not $90,000 thrown into the  ocean;\r\n\r\nrather  with  it we can train representatives  from\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Mr Speaker, that today the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nnaturally represents the majority of the people. On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, we on the Opposition  side,  also\r\n\r\nrepresent  the  people of Singapore.  Although  the\r\n\r\nnumber  is small, it is the responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to  give  advice  and  views   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to facilitate government administration.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Mr Speaker, if the aim  is  to  lessen\r\n\r\nexpenses,  and  if we take that  as  a  basis,  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  in  this  Assembly  might  as  well  be\r\n\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to minimise the work. Mr Speaker, it\r\n\r\nwas   to  streamline  the  workings  of  the  local\r\n\r\ngovernment that Government appointed a Committee on\r\n\r\nLocal    Government   in   1955   which    included\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the P.A.P. That Committee put up\r\n\r\na  number of suggestions, among others, to separate\r\n\r\npublic utilities from the City Council. It was also\r\n\r\nsuggested that Government should unite a number  of\r\n\r\ndepartments in the City Council with those  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  When the present Government  say  that\r\n\r\nthey  want  to  lessen  work,  it  is  not  a   new\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  It  is  really  an  old  proposal,   a\r\n\r\nproposal  which was submitted by the  Committee  on\r\n\r\nLocal  Government and was accepted by the  previous\r\n\r\nAssembly.  The  matter of lessening the  work,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, is a matter which has been accepted by the\r\n\r\nprevious Government, including the Opposition side,\r\n\r\nthat is to say, the representatives of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason which has been put up by the\r\n\r\nGovernment is to centralise administration. It is a\r\n\r\ngood  thing to centralise administration  and  that\r\n\r\nwas  also  suggested  by  the  Committee.  But   if\r\n\r\ncentralisation means putting into the  hands  of  a\r\n\r\nfew  the  power of life and death then we might  as\r\n\r\nwell have no elected representatives. Just now,  if\r\n\r\nI  am  not  mistaken,  one of the  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment said that in Singapore the population is\r\n\r\nonly 1,500,000. He also said that in a small island\r\n\r\nsuch  as  this, where the population is one  and  a\r\n\r\nhalf million, it is not wise to have a number\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  layers of administration. This I think  is  not\r\n\r\nreason  enough. There are a number of countries  in\r\n\r\nthe world which have a population of less than 1\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion which have an administration as we do  have\r\n\r\nin Singapore - central and local governments. If this\r\n\r\nis  one  of  the reasons, it is not right.  Another\r\n\r\nsaid  that  numerous layers of administration  will\r\n\r\ngive  rise  to  unnecessary arguments  between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and various bodies. But, Mr Speaker,  I\r\n\r\nam of the opinion that because this Assembly is the\r\n\r\nhighest  authority in Singapore, it  has  power  to\r\n\r\namend  laws  and  to take action if  there  is  any\r\n\r\nmaladministration - whether in the City  Council  or\r\n\r\nDistrict Council - which contradicts the position  of\r\n\r\nGovernment.  So the power is with  us.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary   to   abolish  a  body   which   in   my\r\n\r\nopinion - whether administered by Government or  not - should  always work not for self interest  but  for\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we decide today to abolish local government it would mean that we will be taking\r\n\r\naction with an iron hand. Although I know that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has a majority, I am of the opinion that\r\n\r\nthe  decision to abolish local government will only\r\n\r\ngive rise to bad blood which is not good. What will\r\n\r\nthe  people  say? The Government must realise  that\r\n\r\nnot all the people of Singapore voted for them, but\r\n\r\nonly 54 per cent, and there are the 46 per cent who\r\n\r\ndid not vote for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, as far as I know, from my\r\n\r\nexperience,  it  is  only countries  which  do  not\r\n\r\npractise democracy which can and indeed had carried\r\n\r\nout a measure such as this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the Bill before us and under\r\n\r\ndiscussion  today, in my opinion, is a  Bill  which\r\n\r\nshould  not be debated upon at great length because\r\n\r\nthe  question of absorbing the departments  of  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  into Government service,  especially\r\n\r\ninto  the  Ministry  of National  Development,  has\r\n\r\nalready  received the support of the people because\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. has made it a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajor  point  on its platform during  the  election\r\n\r\ncampaign.  For  the information of  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers,  our Party has been successful in  getting\r\n\r\nthe  reins  of Government in Singapore  today.  The\r\n\r\nbasic question which should be discussed concerning\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  absorption of these  departments\r\n\r\ninto Government service is the question of finance.\r\n\r\nThe  financial  stringency faced by the  Government\r\n\r\ntoday  is  a real one. We have asked the people  to\r\n\r\ntake  steps to do their bit to shoulder this urgent\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the Member for Geylang Serai say\r\n\r\nthat  this Government is taking action with an iron\r\n\r\nhand, and the Member for Southern Islands has  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government is not practising  democracy.\r\n\r\nBut this, surely, is absolutely untrue, because the\r\n\r\nfactors  which we should consider are varied.  What\r\n\r\nhas  been  said by the Member for Geylang Serai  is\r\n\r\nonly a figment of his clouded and erratic thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe  stated that the previous Government had  formed\r\n\r\ncommittees,  etc.  But  the ex-Minister  for  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Lands and Housing should realise  that\r\n\r\nwhatever departments are functioning in the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment, for example, the departments of health,\r\n\r\narchitecture and engineering are also to  be  found\r\n\r\nin  the  City Council. And all these factors should\r\n\r\nbe  seriously  considered;  we  have  a  number  of\r\n\r\ndepartments  in  the Government  and  in  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  where the nature of the jobs done  is  the\r\n\r\nsame.  The best example I can cite is the  question\r\n\r\nof  building houses. The plans for these houses are\r\n\r\ngiven  to the City Council, then they are given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Department of Lands and then to the S.I.T.  If\r\n\r\nthey are concerned with rural areas, the plans  are\r\n\r\nsent to the Rural Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is indeed a time-waster. Some plans\r\n\r\ntake  months to be finally approved and  some  have\r\n\r\nbeen  known to take two to three years. This  would\r\n\r\nnot  only  cause loss in revenue to the  Government\r\n\r\nbut this is also a loss of considerable time to the\r\n\r\napplicant.  This  is  a  matter  which  should   be\r\n\r\nrectified in the administration of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main aim regarding administration is to make\r\n\r\nit function smoothly and and efficiently and we can\r\n\r\nachieve  this if we absorb these extra  departments\r\n\r\ninto the central Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wish to say something to the Member for\r\n\r\nSouthern Islands about his reference to the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nas  not  being democratic, by mentioning the recent\r\n\r\nvisit  to the Southern Islands by the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for National Development.\r\n\r\nI  suspect  that  certain  people  are  jealous  or\r\n\r\nenvious  and  feel  that  they  should  have   been\r\n\r\ninformed about this visit. I feel that this kind of\r\n\r\nfeeling should be erased from the mind of everyone\r\n\r\nwho  is  a  democrat, and who is conscious  of  his\r\n\r\nresponsibilities   and  the   responsibilities   of\r\n\r\nothers.  The new Government of Singapore  does  not\r\n\r\nonly look into the interests of Members but rather,\r\n\r\nand  more, into the interest of people as a  whole.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  whoever has a task to  be  carried  out\r\n\r\nshould be able to do so without having to refer  to\r\n\r\nthe  Member of the constituency concerned. Whatever\r\n\r\njob   that  is  done  is  not  done  for  the  self\r\n\r\nglorification of any particular Member but for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the people at large. I do not intend\r\n\r\nto  say anything adverse about the character of the\r\n\r\nMember of the constituency concerned. I want him to\r\n\r\nknow  what the new Government is attempting to  do.\r\n\r\nAs  for  the remarks made by the Member for Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai,  I just have to say that we should work  for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of all. Therefore let us work together\r\n\r\nnot  for any particular section of the people,  but\r\n\r\nfor all the people in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  today  we  are  facing  the   local\r\n\r\ngovernment Bill. We must face it on two reasons.  I\r\n\r\nwish to give the two reasons to our friends on  the\r\n\r\nopposite side. We told our Opposition Members  what\r\n\r\nwe  wanted to do, but if they can be more wise, the\r\n\r\ncreation of this Assembly is by means of democratic\r\n\r\nelection. In the election the P.A.P. had a  certain\r\n\r\nand correct manifesto with a five-year Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy  put  before the people for them to  decide.\r\n\r\nToday  we must do the duties which are given to  us\r\n\r\nby  the  will  of  the people. Sir,  talking  about\r\n\r\ndemocracy, we must respect the will of the  people,\r\n\r\nto  put it more correctly. Therefore, this question\r\n\r\nwe can answer Members on the opposite bench.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point. If a government is elected by\r\n\r\nthe  people, then we must think whether we can make\r\n\r\nfull  use of our strength to put our effort  to  do\r\n\r\nthe  things and duties which are given to us by the\r\n\r\npeople.  If  we  can ask ourselves that,  then  our\r\n\r\nanswer must be yes. We must keep our promises  made\r\n\r\nduring  the  elections. If the previous  Government\r\n\r\ndared  to see the people, then they would know  how\r\n\r\nthe  people  suffered. My colleague just  now  said\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  previous  colonial  society,  in  an\r\n\r\napplication for building an attap house,  they  had\r\n\r\nto  run to three departments to get a licence. When\r\n\r\nthey  are hawking, they are suffering two  ways  of\r\n\r\noppression - arrests and prosecutions.  There  is  an\r\n\r\narrest  issued by the central government.  Then  we\r\n\r\nmust  make  the  people  of Singapore  continue  to\r\n\r\nsuffer without any change in the society to improve\r\n\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can amend this Bill then we can make full\r\n\r\nuse  and  save  a lot of effort by  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  we  can lessen a  great  amount  of\r\n\r\ninconvenience  that  has been  put  on  the  common\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore. During this period of change,\r\n\r\nwe must get rid of the bureaucracy that was left to\r\n\r\nus by the previous Government. We must establish an\r\n\r\nefficient administration. All this work depends  on\r\n\r\nthe  joint  effort of the Members of this Assembly.\r\n\r\nThis  refers  to the livelihood of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and we must try our best to  meet  their\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nHonourable Minister in charge of the Bill in moving\r\n\r\nthe  Second Reading of this Bill gave, in  fact,  a\r\n\r\nvery  short  speech.

They had to find a reasonable excuse  why\r\n\r\nthese  City  Councillors deserted  their  posts  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  what  their chairman  said  at  a  Press\r\n\r\nConference  when  my colleague,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLocal Government, Lands and Housing in the previous\r\n\r\nGovernment,  took over certain powers of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  What did their chairman say? \"The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nCity   Councillors  will  remain   in   office   to\r\n\r\nserve\" - this  is  what  he  said -  \"to   serve   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the hawkers, the taxi drivers  and  a\r\n\r\nlot  of other things, the proletariat.\" This,  Sir,\r\n\r\nis  the Party that claims that it always stands  on\r\n\r\nwhat  it  says.

There was this sudden - I\r\n\r\nwill not call it running away - this sudden desire to\r\n\r\nbetter serve the people of Singapore, and they  had\r\n\r\nto  find  a  reasonable excuse.  And  what  is  the\r\n\r\nreasonable  excuse?  \"Oh, the City  Council  is  no\r\n\r\ngood!  We  scrap  it!\" Sure,  it  is  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nexcuse. It had never been in their minds before. In\r\n\r\nfact,  if  it had been, the Chairman of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwould  not  have  said, \"Our City Councillors  will\r\n\r\nremain   in   office   to  serve   the   people - the\r\n\r\nproletariat.\"  Yes,  nice  word - the  \"proletariat\".\r\n\r\nThen  they  say,  \"This is for better  efficiency.\"\r\n\r\nWonderful, Sir, It means that during the time  when\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. was in power in the City Council,  they\r\n\r\nwere not efficient. Therefore, they must scrap  the\r\n\r\nCity Council for better efficiency. Wonderful!  For\r\n\r\neconomies?   Yes.  And  yet  during  the   election\r\n\r\ncampaign  what  assurance was  given  to  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil employees? \"We will scrap the City Council,\r\n\r\nbut  the City Council employees need not be  unduly\r\n\r\nalarmed.

We do not  want\r\n\r\n30  cents.

Therefore, they\r\n\r\nare happier. Indeed they are happier!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now. Sir, why scrap the City Council? We say that\r\n\r\nit  is  good that there shall be a City Council  so\r\n\r\nthat  there  shall be a training ground for  future\r\n\r\nlegislators.  If there had not been a City  Council\r\n\r\nduring  our  time, I do not think the P.A.P. would\r\n\r\nhave  become so, shall we say - I will not  use  the\r\n\r\nword  \"notorious\" - so well-known for its  activities\r\n\r\nto  help the proletariat. It is because of the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  that  the P.A.P. was able to  capture  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  with 13 seats. That was  because  of\r\n\r\ndrive and ingenuity. That I must give credit to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Mayor.  They brought to the  forefront  the\r\n\r\nmeaning  of an elected Government. It served  their\r\n\r\npurpose and now they want to scrap the City Council\r\n\r\nbecause perhaps they now feel that if there were to\r\n\r\nbe further elections today to fill the vacant seats\r\n\r\nin the City Council, the P.A.P. would be nowhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  because  they fear that  that  is  so  that\r\n\r\ntherefore they should scrap the City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is what you say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> What I say and what the others\r\n\r\nmight  say  can  never be proved until  and  unless\r\n\r\nthere be by-elections or there is a by-election  to\r\n\r\nthe City Council.

As I have said, it is going to provide  a\r\n\r\nstep  for, shall we say, local politicians to climb\r\n\r\nto  this  Assembly. They say they want merger  with\r\n\r\nthe   Federation.  We  all  want  merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation,   and  yet  in  every  state   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation, there are municipalities. Now,  suppose\r\n\r\nSingapore  were to become a state of the Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya and, by becoming a part of the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya,  we  accept  the  Constitution  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. Therefore, there would  have\r\n\r\nto be municipalities. Perhaps they will say, \"Never\r\n\r\nmind,  we  in Singapore do not want a municipality.\r\n\r\nThe City Council is not good enough because we have\r\n\r\ndone enough damage. We do not want other people  to\r\n\r\ncorrect  the damage that we have done,  nor  do  we\r\n\r\nwant  to be exposed. The damage we have done should\r\n\r\nnot be exposed.\" That is why they want to scrap the\r\n\r\nCity Council now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about the public utilities? They have\r\n\r\nsaid.  Sir,  I think during the election  campaign,\r\n\r\nthat  the public utilities will be taken away  from\r\n\r\nthe  City Council and be handed over to Boards. Not\r\n\r\na  word  have they uttered about this. Do they  now\r\n\r\nmean that they did not mean what they said? Perhaps\r\n\r\nsometimes they try to say what they mean and end up\r\n\r\nby saying they do not mean what they say!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a politician\r\n\r\nlike  the  Member  for  Cairnhill  deserves  to  be\r\n\r\ncongratulated on one special attribute of his,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is his capacity to survive. When the military\r\n\r\nadministration   was  dissolved   and   the   civil\r\n\r\ngovernment  was proclaimed by the British  colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment, he was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnominated a Member of the then Legislative Council.\r\n\r\nSince then, there have been various changes in  the\r\n\r\nconstitution of our country. There have  even  been\r\n\r\nelections.  The  Member  for  Cairnhill  has  shown\r\n\r\nconsiderable  intrepidity  in  surviving  and  even\r\n\r\nprospering   for   a  while  throughout   all   the\r\n\r\nvicissitudes  of  our constitutional  changes.  One\r\n\r\nwould  have thought, Sir, that as a result  of  his\r\n\r\nwide   experience   he  would  have   learned   one\r\n\r\nprinciple, and it is this: that what is  right  and\r\n\r\nproper  under  one  set  of  circumstances  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily right and proper under another  set  of\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the P.A.P. contested the City Council\r\n\r\nelections, the main purpose was to use this vehicle\r\n\r\nof  local government to serve the people, and  more\r\n\r\nparticularly  to  bring about the contrast  between\r\n\r\nwhat  a vigorous and dynamic Party can provide  for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of the people and what a feeble, inept\r\n\r\nand  decadent Party can perform. During the  period\r\n\r\nof the Rendel Constitution, it was absolutely vital\r\n\r\nthat this lesson be brought home to the electorate.\r\n\r\nNow,  Sir,  we  have  a new Constitution,  and  the\r\n\r\nfunctions  which certain organs of local government\r\n\r\nperform  must be reviewed in the light of  the  new\r\n\r\npolitical situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has had the temerity to\r\n\r\nsuggest that the P.A.P. runs away. The P.A.P., Sir,\r\n\r\ndoes  not  run  away.  When  the  City  Councillors\r\n\r\nresigned, they did not retire to Ipoh with a bagful\r\n\r\nof  money. They faced the people again, put forward\r\n\r\nnew  policies  for the approval of the  electorate.\r\n\r\nThat is not running away, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has further suggested\r\n\r\nthat  the  City Council may be useful or should  be\r\n\r\nretained because it provides a training ground  for\r\n\r\nfuture legislators. Now, the City Council has  been\r\n\r\nin  existence for quite a number of years and if we\r\n\r\nwere  to study the records of the majority of  City\r\n\r\nCouncillors, we can see no evidence whatsoever that\r\n\r\ntheir  terms of service had done them any  good  at\r\n\r\nall. If they have received any training, it is such\r\n\r\nas  to  make more certain that they will meet  with\r\n\r\ndisaster  in  a fair contest before the  electorate\r\n\r\nwith  a  Party that has contact with the masses  at\r\n\r\nthe grass roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the hon. Members of the Opposition have\r\n\r\ndelivered  a  number of homilies on the  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem. I have no doubt that they will continue  to\r\n\r\ndeliver further homilies in the future, but  may  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that in their future efforts, they  try  to\r\n\r\ndistinguish between the form of a democratic  state\r\n\r\nand  its substance? The form of a democratic  state\r\n\r\nfinds  expression in various organs of  Government,\r\n\r\nin  institutions  such as the  judiciary,  the  law\r\n\r\ncourts,  the  Public  Service  Commission,  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.  Indeed,  in  this  very  House  itself,  we\r\n\r\nobserve certain - may I put it - rituals with which the\r\n\r\nbusiness of this House can be conducted with  order\r\n\r\nand  expedition. For instance, Sir, when you  enter\r\n\r\nthis  building, it is the convention - it is  perhaps\r\n\r\neven  the duty - of every Member in this Assembly  to\r\n\r\nstand up as a token of respect and as an expression\r\n\r\nof  acceptance  of  the need for order  and  proper\r\n\r\nprocedures  in  debate. But  no  one  is  going  to\r\n\r\nsuggest, Sir, that these forms are the essence of a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system. You will find  rituals  equally\r\n\r\nelaborate observed perhaps in the Reichstag of  the\r\n\r\nlate  lamented  Herr Hitler. In the  Roman  Senate,\r\n\r\nsimilar  elaborate  rituals were  observed  by  the\r\n\r\nsenators  and equal respect was paid - perhaps  in  a\r\n\r\nmore elaborate way - to victorious generals returning\r\n\r\nfrom  campaigns  to Rome. These are  the  forms  by\r\n\r\nwhich  the state carries out its functions and  one\r\n\r\nmust be careful to distinguish between the forms of\r\n\r\na democratic system and the substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the situation that we find ourselves today,\r\n\r\nthe  substance  of  a  democratic  system  can   be\r\n\r\nexpressed in a few simple words. Today, we have  an\r\n\r\nenergetic  electorate  mostly  brought  up  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  cultural tradition. They do  not  have  as\r\n\r\npart of their culture any love and respect for  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  traditions  and  procedures  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  system. So far as they are concerned,  the\r\n\r\nposition  is  this. They have elected a  Government\r\n\r\nwhich  has certain powers and which has to  operate\r\n\r\nunder certain limitations, and they demand of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  that,  within the  five  years  of  its\r\n\r\noffice, it must produce tangible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  concrete results in the way of the improvement\r\n\r\nin the standard of living of the humble people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the substance of the democratic system\r\n\r\nhere.  Can  your  elected  Government  produce  the\r\n\r\nresults  which the people demand? It  may  have  to\r\n\r\nmodify the institutions which it has inherited from\r\n\r\nthe  colonial powers, and indeed my Government will\r\n\r\nnot  hesitate to scrap any institution  we  inherit\r\n\r\nfrom the past which we find unsuitable and unfitted\r\n\r\nfor  the present. Our supreme purpose is to deliver\r\n\r\nthe  goods for the people and that is the real test\r\n\r\nof  the  democratic system, not the frills and  the\r\n\r\nfroth about which Opposition Members have waxed  so\r\n\r\nlong and, to my mind, to so little purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nand  hon.  Members,  in our debate  today  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the suspension of the local government\r\n\r\nauthorities  of the past, I am of the opinion  that\r\n\r\nmy  view may differ from that of others. But I wish\r\n\r\nto   say  what  I  think  is  reasonable  for  all,\r\n\r\nparticularly for our society and our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this debate, we wish to suspend the\r\n\r\nlegislation  concerning local government.  I  admit\r\n\r\nthe victory achieved by the P.A.P. is resounding so\r\n\r\nthat  they are now holding the reins of government,\r\n\r\nwhich we cannot say is the case with us although we\r\n\r\ncan give opposition that is acceptable. However for\r\n\r\nour part, I often hear in the course of debate that\r\n\r\nour debate is based on discussions, that is to say,\r\n\r\non  negotiations between one side and another,  and\r\n\r\non   compromise  in  order  to  bring   about   the\r\n\r\nbetterment of our society which, it could be  said.\r\n\r\nis    meeting   with   various   difficulties   and\r\n\r\nshortcomings, in our struggle to achieve  the  type\r\n\r\nof independence which we all long for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I am not surprised at all to see that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has already introduced a Bill for us  to\r\n\r\ndebate  upon. Perhaps there will be people who,  on\r\n\r\nreading this paper tomorrow, would say that we  are\r\n\r\ndebating  in the manner of people who  are  in  the\r\n\r\nwrong places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I know and understand that old clothes will be\r\n\r\nrefused  by those who are recently victorious,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore the old clothes must be changed  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe change of time on the basis of one's struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us ponder together about the future\r\n\r\nconsequences and the benefits that will be  enjoyed\r\n\r\nby our society and our country in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, as one who at all times wishes to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  position  of  the  Government,   to\r\n\r\ncriticise it in a manner wherein it could  be  said\r\n\r\nwe   are  upholding  the  struggle,  this  Bill  is\r\n\r\npremature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government finds that my view is\r\n\r\nunacceptable, it can say that it is the duty of the\r\n\r\nOpposition to oppose; the Bill is too premature and\r\n\r\nhasty. It is too hasty for the Government to  carry\r\n\r\nout  such  a policy. I believe it is our  good  and\r\n\r\npure   intention;  as  clarified  by  one  of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition Members earlier, it is our objective  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard the welfare of the citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have a Bill for the suspension of past\r\n\r\nlocal government authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my view that our brothers in the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  will take notice of this, in regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  question of a merger which, I feel in the long\r\n\r\nrun, is of prime importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if a matter of policy such as this could be\r\n\r\nmutually discussed in a spirit of compromise rather\r\n\r\nthan in a spirit of showing how plucky we are, then\r\n\r\nit  is  the main question of merger that should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered, for in many States in the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya, local governments are still functioning  in\r\n\r\nthe  small areas, perhaps to afford the opportunity\r\n\r\nof  training  those  who  are  keen  to  serve  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I have no doubt that local government is like\r\n\r\nnormal  clothing. As I have said earlier, I  myself\r\n\r\nwould refuse clothes which are handed down and left\r\n\r\nby those who have gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other important thing which I wish\r\n\r\nto  stress  on and which I hope will be  heeded.  I\r\n\r\nhave seen it happen in the City Council in the past\r\n\r\nwhen the P.A.P. was in power. I hope,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  possible, let nothing be done which perhaps  is\r\n\r\nunacceptable to a section of the people of which we\r\n\r\nare the representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding students who have passed Standard Seven\r\n\r\nin  Malay  Schools, I congratulate the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  which has announced that the Ministry  will\r\n\r\naccept  these  students for employment  in  various\r\n\r\ncapacities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if this Government will continue with this\r\n\r\npolicy  as  regards the students  who  have  passed\r\n\r\nStandard Seven in Malay Schools, I believe  perhaps\r\n\r\nit will get good support from the people; but if it\r\n\r\nis only to make fun of our struggle, then I believe\r\n\r\nwe will not enjoy what we set out to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that is the matter to which I wish to draw the\r\n\r\nattention  of the Ministry which moved  this  Bill.\r\n\r\nFor  if  it wants to carry out the policy  let  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  do it with full discretion and  not  with\r\n\r\ndiscrimination against that section of  the  people\r\n\r\nwhich, it can be said, wants to co-operate with the\r\n\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one example which I hope would be carried\r\n\r\nout by the Ministry concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, I wish to clarify further:\r\n\r\nalthough I am from the Opposition side, as one  who\r\n\r\nis  upholding the policy of his Party,  it  is  the\r\n\r\nbasic  principle  for the Opposition,  particularly\r\n\r\nfor myself, to continue with what other Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition have said earlier; if possible,  as\r\n\r\nit  must be, in our struggle, let it be seen by our\r\n\r\nbrothers  in the Federation with whom we are  proud\r\n\r\nto  reunite, and let it be observed by our brothers\r\n\r\nwho  are not far distant in Indonesia, that  we  in\r\n\r\nour  struggle today are not taking the  opportunity\r\n\r\nof using any public facilities or utilities such as\r\n\r\nwater,  the  civil service, gas or  electricity  as\r\n\r\npolitical weapons; for with the existence  of  this\r\n\r\nBill - or   it   could  be  said  it  is  unanimously\r\n\r\nagreed - all responsibilities for public service  are\r\n\r\nsuspended; I fear if that is the case, the question\r\n\r\nof  understanding and goodwill between one  another\r\n\r\nwill not be anywhere near.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is the main point - this question of water,\r\n\r\nlight, etc. - the time has come for the Government to\r\n\r\nset it aside\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  that this matter will not flare up as it had in\r\n\r\nthe   past   City  Council,  particularly   between\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. and the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope the Government who has the majority\r\n\r\nvote  today  will act with justice for all  without\r\n\r\nfavour to any particular group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, hon.

Inche\r\n\r\nBaharuddin  that  I  am not  trying  to  defend  my\r\n\r\ncolleague  Inche Ahmad Jabri, but what  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nclarify is -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

We\r\n\r\nhave  heard  a  number of people of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nremarking  about  the past City Council  and  about\r\n\r\nmembers of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to mention that no matter what kind of accusation comes from the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  we have witnessed that the  people  as\r\n\r\njudges have given their verdict and that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nParty   has  won  43  seats  and  has  formed   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  As  stated by the Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan,  he  objected to the City Council  being\r\n\r\nhanded  over to the Government. He mentioned  about\r\n\r\nthe unification with the Federation - I think he does\r\n\r\nnot  see  far enough, because in future we  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what  the  condition or the  changes  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation will be. Therefore, on the part  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. as the Government today, we should use  our\r\n\r\ninitiative  as quickly as possible to  improve  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the people of Singapore.

Today we have  heard  various\r\n\r\ncriticisms  from  the side which was  formerly  the\r\n\r\nGovernment but now the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I know the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill;   as  has  already  been  said   by   my\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  we know him to be a smooth politician,\r\n\r\nadept  at  the  game of politics,  and  so  is  his\r\n\r\nfriend, the Member for Geylang Serai - the Dato, who,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, is not here. He does not feel  happy\r\n\r\nabout his position today, though not so long ago he\r\n\r\nwas  a  very  proud person and claimed  to  be  the\r\n\r\nleader  of his community in Singapore. But after  I\r\n\r\nhave  heard him and seen him for four years  he  is\r\n\r\nnow   a   different  man,  completely  altered   in\r\n\r\ncharacter and behaviour. That is what surprises me.\r\n\r\nThe  reason I say so, Mr Speaker, about the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Geylang  Serai is that if he  had  a  definite\r\n\r\npolicy  or  a firm stand, I believe he  would  have\r\n\r\nspoken differently from what he did just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai stated the\r\n\r\nGovernment   led  by  the  P.A.P. is   maintaining\r\n\r\npolicies and making decisions that are not  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people of Singapore. Today is  the\r\n\r\nfirst   time  I  heard  him  talk  of  the   people\r\n\r\ngenerally. Outside this Assembly, he does not  talk\r\n\r\nabout  the people as a whole, irrespective of race,\r\n\r\ncreed and religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut   here,   everyone   claims   himself   as    a\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the people, defending the people,\r\n\r\nfor the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Government and\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  side, I say that  we  are  brave\r\n\r\nenough to face facts; whatever we say to the people\r\n\r\nwe  intend carrying out; we are not scared to  meet\r\n\r\nthem  and  face criticisms, or whether our  actions\r\n\r\nare  unsatisfactory  to  a small  minority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we have been hearing since this morning\r\n\r\nis  just talk about democracy. Everyone is fond  of\r\n\r\ntalking about democracy. Outside this House we  see\r\n\r\nmany  of  those who in the past knew nothing  about\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  movement appear in various  guises  as\r\n\r\nLabour  leaders.  Why is this so?  I  believe,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, it is because they do not agree with  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in particular and with the government of the\r\n\r\npeople in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question under discussion in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  concerning the  suspension  of  the\r\n\r\nlocal  government  and  the  transferring  of   its\r\n\r\nfunctions    into   the   Ministry   of    National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, we have heard the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nsaying  that the Members of the P.A.P. in the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  ran  from their posts. But I fee  that  if\r\n\r\nthose P.A.P. Members were really irresponsible  and\r\n\r\ndid  not dare face facts, they would not have  come\r\n\r\nout  to contest the last elections. The reason  why\r\n\r\nthey  walked  out of the City Council  was  because\r\n\r\nthey  believed  it was their duty to  do  so.  They\r\n\r\nbelieved  the reason why it was necessary for  them\r\n\r\nto leave the City Council was the responsibility of\r\n\r\nthe  past  Government. It had  carried  out  secret\r\n\r\nmeans  to stain the good name of the P.A.P. members\r\n\r\nwho  had  a  majority in the City  Council.  But  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  on  the part of the Member for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nand  the Minister then responsible - the Minister for\r\n\r\nLocal  Government, Lands and Housing - they had taken\r\n\r\nvarious measures to confuse the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. and its members in the City Council\r\n\r\nwere carrying out polices which were unsuitable and\r\n\r\nagainst the wishes of the people. But, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nI  feel,  on that matter, the people today  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger the same in their outlook as in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  past  several years. They are awake  and  they\r\n\r\nknow how to choose between the good and the bad. If\r\n\r\nMembers  of the P.A.P. in the City Council  carried\r\n\r\nout  their  duties  for their own selfish  purpose,\r\n\r\nthen the affairs of the City Council would not have\r\n\r\nbeen  as  satisfactory as they actually were  while\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. was in control of the City Council  for\r\n\r\n14 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If what I heard just now was correct - I hope if\r\n\r\nit was wrong, the Member for Cairnhill would please\r\n\r\ncorrect me - he too congratulated the ex-Mayor who is\r\n\r\nnow  the Minister for National Development  in  our\r\n\r\ngovernment today, for the able manner in  which  he\r\n\r\ncarried out the administration of the City Council.\r\n\r\nBut I am surprised and perplexed here, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthat  there are Members of the Opposition  who  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  People's Action Party is always  priding\r\n\r\nitself  on  the fact that whatever it promises  and\r\n\r\nsays, it fulfils - it does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill made reference to what\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman of our Party had stated at the  Press\r\n\r\nconference.   Our  Chairman  had  said  before   the\r\n\r\nelections  that whatever the actions  of  the  past\r\n\r\nGovernment against the P.A.P. in the City  Council,\r\n\r\nour  Party would continue to serve the people. What\r\n\r\nour  Chairman said was true, and we carried it out.\r\n\r\nBut   when   we  faced  the  Singapore  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  elections, we felt that it  was  time  we\r\n\r\ntold  the  people  of  the  actions  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government, actions which were  incorrect\r\n\r\nand  detrimental to the interests  of  the  people,\r\n\r\nespecially the poor people and those of  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  brackets. That was why we asked our Members\r\n\r\nto  walk  out of the City Council. We brought  them\r\n\r\nout so that we could better ascertain if we had the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of  the people. We have  all  seen  for\r\n\r\nourselves  how happy the people of Singapore  were,\r\n\r\nand we know the sort of confidence they have in the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. That is why we have 43 Members of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nas  representatives, representatives of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore and the new Government - the Government\r\n\r\nof the people and for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was surprised to watch the antics of the Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill. Why, here today, his acrobatics were\r\n\r\nvery like those of a tiger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has\r\n\r\nbeen  guilty of using a certain expression - \"animal\"\r\n\r\nexpression,  shall  we say - with  reference  to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill. I do not think it is right to\r\n\r\ncall  any  Member of this House an  animal  of  any\r\n\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> (In Malay): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nI  did  not say that he was a tiger. I merely  said\r\n\r\nthat  he  behaved  like  one,  and  if  it  was  an\r\n\r\nunparliamentary remark, I would gladly withdraw it.\r\n\r\nI merely likened him to a tiger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to come back to my point. The\r\n\r\nOpposition  have  not  much ground  to  oppose  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  However much they try to say  that  we\r\n\r\nare behaving like dictators, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeel  that the Government today will carry out  its\r\n\r\nduties  justly  and  to the best  interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore without distinction  of  race,\r\n\r\ncreed   and   colour.  If  we  wish   to   practise\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, we cannot agree  with  the\r\n\r\npoint  that  we are representatives of a particular\r\n\r\ngroup  of people, because this Assembly is a  forum\r\n\r\nfor  us to discuss affairs affecting the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
