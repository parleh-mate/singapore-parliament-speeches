Government and Singapore Airlines intend to take  regarding\r\n\r\nthe SilkAir accident.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Communications and Information Technology\r\n\r\n(Mr  Yeo  Cheow Tong):  Sir, may I have your permission to  take\r\n\r\nthe first three Questions together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, in accordance with international\r\n\r\npractice, the investigations into the crash of SilkAir Flight MI\r\n\r\n185  are led by Indonesia, the state of occurrence of the crash.\r\n\r\nThey are being conducted by a competent and independent team  of\r\n\r\nprofessional air accident investigators.  The investigators  are\r\n\r\nfrom  Indonesia,  Singapore, the US and  Australia.   They  have\r\n\r\naccess  to  the best investigation facilities, laboratories  and\r\n\r\nexpertise   in   these   countries.    The   Aircraft   Accident\r\n\r\nInvestigation Commission has been constituted according to well-established  practices  laid  down by  the  International  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation Organisation (ICAO).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In carrying out its investigation, this multi-national team\r\n\r\nis  looking  into  all  relevant aspects  in  a  systematic  and\r\n\r\nholistic manner.  This includes investigating the human  factor.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  a sub-group of the investigation team is specifically\r\n\r\ntasked  with  that  responsibility.  Members of  this  sub-group\r\n\r\ninclude  pilots, psychologists, a psychiatrist,  and  a  medical\r\n\r\ndoctor.    The   investigation  team  has  access  to   relevant\r\n\r\ninformation  on  human factors in Singapore  as  well  as  other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the team has also been looking into the\r\n\r\nrelevant  operational procedures of SilkAir and  will  certainly\r\n\r\nreport on any shortcomings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completion of its investigations, the investigation\r\n\r\nteam will submit its final\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreport  to  ICAO  and  concerned states.  ICAO  will  study  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  and  propose  improvements  where   applicable.\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  certainly  adopt any  ICAO  recommendation  to\r\n\r\nenhance aviation safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore Police Investigation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House is aware, the Indonesian Minister of\r\n\r\nCommunications, Mr Giri Hadihardjono, informed me on 25th August\r\n\r\n1999  that  the  team investigating the SilkAir  Flight  MI  185\r\n\r\naccident  has found indications raising suspicions that unlawful\r\n\r\ninterference may have been a factor in the accident.   Based  on\r\n\r\nthis suspicion, the Singapore Government has referred the matter\r\n\r\nto  the  Singapore Police.  The Police is conducting a  separate\r\n\r\npolice  investigation into the matter in consultation  with  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Prosecutor  to ascertain if there  is  evidence  of  any\r\n\r\ncriminal offence.  I can assure Members that the Police will  be\r\n\r\nthorough and professional and will also examine all the relevant\r\n\r\ndetails, including the financial records.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should therefore await the findings of the Accident\r\n\r\nInvestigation  Team  and  the Police  Investigation,  especially\r\n\r\nsince the Accident Investigation Team is now in the final stages\r\n\r\nof its investigations.  There is no necessity to appoint another\r\n\r\ninquiry into the matter, and we should not complicate matters by\r\n\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Aviation Standards and Procedures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has asked whether the authority will review\r\n\r\nits pilot requirements in the light of the recent findings.  The\r\n\r\nCivil  Aviation Authority of Singapore or CAAS ensures that  our\r\n\r\naviation  regulations and operational procedures of our airlines\r\n\r\nconform  fully to international norms stipulated  by  ICAO.   As\r\n\r\nsuch,  the  CAAS  continuously monitors and reviews  the  flight\r\n\r\noperations and engineering procedures of both SilkAir and SIA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both pilots of MI 185 satisfied the licensing requirements\r\n\r\nbased on international norms stipulated by ICAO.  CAAS has  also\r\n\r\nlooked into the three disciplinary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncases  involving  the  pilot, Captain Tsu  Way  Ming.   CAAS  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that the safety of the aircraft or persons  on  board\r\n\r\nwas never compromised in each case, and that there was no reason\r\n\r\nfor SilkAir to ground Captain Tsu.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the interim update confirms that \"both pilots\r\n\r\nwere  properly trained, licensed, and qualified to  conduct  the\r\n\r\nflight.\"   In fact, the Airline Pilots Association of  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  issued a statement on 29th August 1999 to say that \"In  our\r\n\r\nprofessional   opinion,   these  (3)  incidents,   when   viewed\r\n\r\nsingularly  or  collectively do not  constitute  operational  or\r\n\r\nperformance-related incompetence.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our airlines also benchmark their standards against that of\r\n\r\ninternational airlines in leading aviation countries  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  in line with ICAO guidelines and  international\r\n\r\nbest  practice.  Nonetheless, we cannot be complacent.  We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  review  and  upgrade our  aviation  standards  and\r\n\r\nprocedures as the best international practices evolve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me state that the Government fully\r\n\r\nappreciates the anguish of the next-of-kins and their anxiety to\r\n\r\nlearn  the  cause of the MI 185 crash.  While the  investigation\r\n\r\nteam  has  made  further progress, it has yet to  establish  the\r\n\r\ncause of the accident.  The team needs to carry out further work\r\n\r\nto  analyse  the facts and findings before it can  conclude  the\r\n\r\ninvestigation.   The  Government will  continue  to  participate\r\n\r\nactively  in the investigations and will extend our fullest  co-operation to the investigation team.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Will the Minister be\r\n\r\nable  to  tell  us  whether there is any  coroner's  inquiry  in\r\n\r\nSingapore on this matter?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, we have sought the advice of the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General and we have been advised that in this case, the\r\n\r\ncoroner has no jurisdiction because under the Criminal Procedure\r\n\r\nCode,  he  can  only inquire into the death of a person  or  the\r\n\r\nfinding of a dead body in suspicious circumstances in Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand which is within the territorial jurisdiction of the coroner.\r\n\r\nIn  the present case, the death occurred in Palembang, Indonesia\r\n\r\nwhen  the aircraft crashed into the River Musi.

This\r\n\r\nmakes up less than 0.08% of the Police Force strength.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner of Police has given the assurance that\r\n\r\ncorrupt  officers will be systematically weeded-out.

In June last year, the speed limits\r\n\r\nof  nine  roads  were raised from 50 kmh to 60 kmh.   The  speed\r\n\r\nlimit  of  10 more roads will similarly be raised to 60  kmh  in\r\n\r\nOctober this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the years, there have been improvements made to a\r\n\r\nnumber of roads and expressways and also to vehicle engineering.\r\n\r\nSome  of  the  expressways  can therefore  accommodate  vehicles\r\n\r\ntravelling  at  higher  speeds.

Since then, the proposal has been reviewed\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to time.  One main issue surrounding the project  is\r\n\r\nits  high cost, recently estimated at 810 billion baht or  about\r\n\r\nS$35  billion.  There are also concerns about the impact of such\r\n\r\na project on the environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there has been renewed discussion on the Kra Canal\r\n\r\nproject  recently, the Thai government has yet to  come  to  any\r\n\r\ndecision.   According to a report in the Business Times on  28th\r\n\r\nAugust,  Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai told reporters  that,\r\n\r\nand I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There is no plan to build the canal for now. It is still\r\n\r\nbeing studied and it is not a simple issue.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, if the project were to finally proceed and\r\n\r\na shipping route across Southern Thailand established, the Canal\r\n\r\nwould undoubtedly divert some shipping away from the Malacca\r\n\r\nStraits and Singapore Straits. These would be mainly ships which\r\n\r\ntransit the Straits without intending to call at our port.\r\n\r\nHowever, as Singapore is a major shipping hub, the majority of\r\n\r\nvessels at our port come here to discharge and load cargo,\r\n\r\nundergo repairs and take bunkers, ship stores, water and other\r\n\r\nmaterials.  Hence, the challenge for PSA depends not on whether\r\n\r\nthere is a Kra Canal, but on whether we remain competitive as a\r\n\r\nshipping hub which ships choose to come to because it makes good\r\n\r\neconomic and business sense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even without the Kra Canal, PSA faces intense regional and\r\n\r\ninternational  competition.  Therefore, we never  take  our  hub\r\n\r\nport  status  for granted. Our port must always be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nface  new  challenges  and  be  proactive  in  maintaining   its\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness. This is why PSA continually strives  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  it  delivers the highest level of service  at  competitive\r\n\r\nrates,  and  that it has excellent connections to ports  in  the\r\n\r\nregion  and  worldwide.  In  addition,  the  Maritime  and  Port\r\n\r\nAuthority  of  Singapore is also working with relevant  agencies\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the Trade Development Board to see how we can  further\r\n\r\ndevelop Singapore as an international maritime centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COSMPOLITANS AND HEARTLANDERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Socio-economic disparity)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  (a) what is the assessment of his Ministry  on  the\r\n\r\nsocio-economic   disparity   between   the   cosmopolitans   and\r\n\r\nheartlanders  of our population; (b) whether this socio-economic\r\n\r\ndisparity  is fast growing as a result of our globalisation  and\r\n\r\ninjection  of  foreign  talent into our society;  and  (c)  what\r\n\r\nstrategic  measures are being taken by his Ministry  to  counter\r\n\r\nthis disintegrating factor of our multi-racial society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr\r\n\r\nAbdullah Tarmugi):  Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nused the terms \"cosmopolitans\" and \"heartlanders\" of our\r\n\r\npopulation, he was referring to the outlook of two broad\r\n\r\ncategories of people and reiterated that both were important to\r\n\r\nSingapore's well being.  Each has its own distinct contribution\r\n\r\nto our society.  For example, the heartlanders play a major role\r\n\r\nin maintaining the core values and our social stability and give\r\n\r\nus our Singapore brand name.

This old Chamber  has\r\n\r\nbeen  the seat of Singapore's Legislature since 1955.  The  1955\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly consisted of only 25  elected  Members,  4\r\n\r\nNominated Members, 3 ex-officio Members and the Speaker,  making\r\n\r\na  total of 33.  By 1997, Parliament has increased in size to 93\r\n\r\nMembers, including 9 Nominated and 1 Non-Constituency Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present building, over a period of time, had undergone\r\n\r\nseveral renovations to accommodate the increase in the number of\r\n\r\nMembers  and the accompanying support services, such as  library\r\n\r\nand  administration, as well as increased space for TV  and  the\r\n\r\npress.   It  was  not possible to expand this  elegant  but  old\r\n\r\nbuilding  to meet the needs of our future growth, including  the\r\n\r\nuse of information\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnology in the Chamber.  Hence, the Government\r\n\r\ndecided to build a bigger Parliament House in 1992.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Parliament House has a Chamber for 100 Members,\r\n\r\nwith room for another 20, if needed.  It will also be a place of\r\n\r\ninterest  for students and the general public.  It has amenities\r\n\r\nto bring Parliament closer to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the standards of modern buildings in Singapore today,\r\n\r\nthe   new   Parliament  building  is  modest   with   functional\r\n\r\nfurnishing.   It is certainly not a monument to  feed  our  ego.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  it  has captured the dignity of  the  institution\r\n\r\nthat  it  symbolizes.   It  is a worthy  successor  to  the  old\r\n\r\nParliament House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take this opportunity to record the Government's\r\n\r\nappreciation  to  everyone  involved  in  this  major   national\r\n\r\nproject,  especially  the  architects,  engineers,  contractors,\r\n\r\nclerks   of   work,  technicians,  workers  and  the  Parliament\r\n\r\nSecretariat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will no doubt miss this old Chamber. I am happy\r\n\r\nthat  we  will not be leaving everything in this Chamber  behind\r\n\r\nwhen  we  leave  this place.  One small but  symbolic  piece  of\r\n\r\nheritage we will bring along to the new building is the Mace  of\r\n\r\nParliament.   We  have inherited it from the  First  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly.   It will continue to be the symbol of the  inviolable\r\n\r\nauthority  of Parliament and the Speaker, and remind us  of  our\r\n\r\nParliamentary roots.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking for myself, I must say that I am leaving this\r\n\r\nplace with fond memories.  When I first entered this Chamber  23\r\n\r\nyears  ago, I sat in the far corner where Chuang Shaw  Peng  now\r\n\r\nsits.   Next  to me were Rahmat Kenap from Geylang Serai  and  N\r\n\r\nGovindasamy  from  Radin Mas.  Both good men have  since  passed\r\n\r\naway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 11 of us in the 1976 class of new MPs. Now,\r\n\r\nonly four of us are left  -  the Speaker, Dr Ow Chin Hock, Sidek\r\n\r\nSaniff  and  myself.   We are quickly acquiring  the  status  of\r\n\r\nsenior citizens, politically speaking that is.  Among the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members in Parliament today, only Senior Minister\r\n\r\nhas been in this House for a longer period than the four of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My maiden speech on the Motion of Thanks to the President\r\n\r\nfor  his  Address at the Opening of Parliament in February  1977\r\n\r\nwas  heavy  on  economics.  Coming from  a  \"technocrat\"  turned\r\n\r\npolitician,  this was to be expected.  I spoke on  the  need  to\r\n\r\nincrease  our  domestic exports, the problem of job-hopping  and\r\n\r\nshipping.   I  argued that Singapore should aim to  be  a  world\r\n\r\ntranshipment centre instead of just a \"regional warehousing  and\r\n\r\ntranshipment   centre\"   which  was   what   the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nCommunications wanted.   This basic theme, that we need to  look\r\n\r\nbeyond the region, and go global, has become even more important\r\n\r\nnow that the global economy is one single, seamless marketplace.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed my focus in this year's National Day Rally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same session, I was enthralled by Prime Minister\r\n\r\nLee's 3 1/2-hour marathon speech on a range of political issues.\r\n\r\nAt  the end of his speech, he posed a riddle on psephology.   He\r\n\r\ncompared the election result of Marine Parade with Buona Vista's\r\n\r\nand asked why the PAP's performance in Marine Parade, a new town\r\n\r\nwith  the \"mostest\" number of 5- and 4-room flats and no  1-room\r\n\r\nflats,  was  not  as good as that  in Buona Vista,  another  new\r\n\r\nestate  with more than a thousand 1-room flats.  Both  the  late\r\n\r\nAng  Kok  Peng  and  I  had weak opposition candidates.   Marine\r\n\r\nParade  received 76% of the total votes cast while  Buona  Vista\r\n\r\nreceived  80%.   That was my first lesson in  understanding  the\r\n\r\nfactors, including race, of why Singaporeans voted the way  they\r\n\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, forging a strong nation out of our multi-ethnicity\r\n\r\nand diversity is an even greater challenge for us than\r\n\r\nSingapore's economic competitiveness.  We have learned valuable\r\n\r\nlessons from the racial riots of the 1960s.  Parliament has\r\n\r\nincorporated various safeguards into our laws to preserve\r\n\r\nreligious and racial harmony.  But social cohesion and managing\r\n\r\ndifferences between different racial, religious and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincome groups in society are something we have to\r\n\r\nwork assiduously for.  Our fundamental challenge is to build\r\n\r\nties among the people and emotional bonds to this country.  So,\r\n\r\nwhen I spoke on the Motion of Thanks to the President, 20 years\r\n\r\nlater, at the 1997 Opening of Parliament, my focus was on the\r\n\r\nneed for Singapore to develop \"heartware\", not just economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  I am glad that this has led to the adoption of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore 21 vision for making Singapore our best home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in 1953, the Rendel Commission recommended a\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly with an elected majority and a ministerial\r\n\r\nform  of  government  to  pave the way  for  self-government  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This led to the first multi-party elections for  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly in 1955.  It was the birth of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nsystem of parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, this Chamber has hosted 3 Legislative\r\n\r\nAssemblies  and 9 Parliaments.  Among us today, Senior  Minister\r\n\r\nis the only Member who has been in this Chamber since 1955.  The\r\n\r\nmany  speeches that he has made in this House, spanning a period\r\n\r\nof  44  years, are a record of the political history  of  modern\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for the first Legislative Assembly from 1955 to\r\n\r\n1959,  the PAP has been the ruling party in the Legislature  for\r\n\r\nan uninterrupted period of 40 years.  In fact, for 16 long years\r\n\r\nbetween  1965  and 1981, there was not even a single  Opposition\r\n\r\nMember  in  Parliament.   After  13  Members  from  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  boycotted  Parliament  in  1965,  the  PAP  won   four\r\n\r\nsuccessive  general elections between 1968  and  1980  in  clean\r\n\r\nsweeps.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This extraordinary situation came about because the PAP\r\n\r\ngoverned  in  the best interests of Singapore and  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThe  people trusted the PAP and the PAP, in turn, returned their\r\n\r\ntrust by delivering results for the country and the people.   We\r\n\r\nmust never betray the trust the people have reposed in us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong support of the people for the PAP Government\r\n\r\nprovided the political\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstability so crucial for economic growth and nation\r\n\r\nbuilding, especially in our early days of independence.  We were\r\n\r\nable to consolidate our young nation and build a strong\r\n\r\nfoundation for the future.  It has also enabled the ruling party\r\n\r\nto take a long-term view in planning and implementing public\r\n\r\npolicies and programmes.  This is an advantage which most\r\n\r\nGovernments in other democracies do not enjoy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this historic occasion, when we move from the old\r\n\r\nbuilding  to  the new, permit me to make some observations  from\r\n\r\nour  experience  of parliamentary democracy, which  the  British\r\n\r\nestablished  by three Orders of the Queen in Council,  in  1955,\r\n\r\n1959   and   1963.   After  we  separated  from  Malaysia,   our\r\n\r\nConstitution  has  been  based on the provisions  of  the  State\r\n\r\nConstitution  prescribed  by the 1963  Order  by  the  Queen  in\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  many of the fundamental articles of the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nConstitution that we had adopted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first observation: clean general elections are critical\r\n\r\nto  the  political governance of Singapore.  The electorate  has\r\n\r\nconfidence  that  all  our  elections  were  fairly  and  openly\r\n\r\nconducted.   There  was  no money politics.   They  trusted  the\r\n\r\nsystem.  As a result, every MP is seen by the electorate  to  be\r\n\r\nnot  only  his  legal but also his legitimate representative  in\r\n\r\nParliament.  He is respected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep our politics clean for so long is no mean\r\n\r\nachievement.  The ruling party has not gone corrupt despite  the\r\n\r\nabsence  of  a  strong  opposition.   In  some  countries  which\r\n\r\nprofessed   to  be  parliamentary  democracies,  elections   are\r\n\r\nfrequently marred by violence, money politics, and all sorts  of\r\n\r\npolitical chicanery.  The result is what the Indonesians  called\r\n\r\nKKN - corruption, cronyism and nepotism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the ruling party's policy to self-renew its MPs at\r\n\r\nevery  general election has made Parliament relevant to changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances  and  the expectations of each new  generation  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Self-renewal  has become  an  accepted  fact  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, not just in Parliament but also in the Civil Service,\r\n\r\nSAF and the Singapore Police Force.  We consciously\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand systematically head-hunt for younger people with\r\n\r\npromise to nurture, develop and take over from us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We owe a big debt here to the Old Guard PAP Ministers and\r\n\r\nMPs.   They  risked  their lives in the  struggles  against  the\r\n\r\ncommunists  and  communalists, planted  the  metaphorical  tree,\r\n\r\nlooked after it, but did not stay on to enjoy the fruits.  Their\r\n\r\ndedication, sacrifice and commitment to the long-term  interests\r\n\r\nof Singapore are values which present and future Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse must emulate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, a key strength of democracy can also turn out to be\r\n\r\na  major  weakness.   Almost  anyone  above  21  can  stand  for\r\n\r\nelection.   But  it  never ceases to amaze me  that  people  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to entrust their and their country's destiny  to  some\r\n\r\nunknowns,   regardless  of  their  competence,  commitment   and\r\n\r\ncharacter.   To  be a SAF officer, a lawyer, an  accountant,  an\r\n\r\nengineer,  or  an  economist, you have to pass stringent  tests.\r\n\r\nBut  there  are  no qualifying tests, no legal requirements  for\r\n\r\nquality  control,  for  anyone who  aspires  to  be  a  people's\r\n\r\nrepresentative.  That this Parliament has a high reputation  for\r\n\r\nefficiency,  effectiveness and integrity,  is  not  the  natural\r\n\r\norder  of  things.  It is the result of the PAP's high standards\r\n\r\nand  its stringent screening of its candidates.  Even then, from\r\n\r\ntime to time, a mistake is made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In politics, either the good keeps out the bad or the bad,\r\n\r\nlike a bad currency, will drive out the good.  Mr Chiam See Tong\r\n\r\nis  living proof of this adage.  He has been driven out  of  his\r\n\r\nformer  party  by a bad currency.  Woe betide the day  when  bad\r\n\r\ncurrencies  get  into  Parliament.  Never think  it  will  never\r\n\r\nhappen.   Hence, in anticipation of this doomsday  scenario,  we\r\n\r\nhave put in place the institution of the elected Presidency with\r\n\r\ncustodial  powers  over our past reserves and  key  appointments\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Government  to  safeguard  Singapore's  long-term\r\n\r\ninterests.   But  the  best safeguard is  within  the  political\r\n\r\nparties  themselves.  They must set high standards so that  only\r\n\r\ncompetent,  honest and deserving candidates are put  before  the\r\n\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, let me stress that our parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy has worked because, over the years, we have carefully\r\n\r\nmade adaptations and modifications to the system which we had\r\n\r\ninherited.  Let me recap some of these changes:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1969: We introduced the institution of the Presidential\r\n\r\nCouncil  for  Minority Rights to ensure that there  will  be  no\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1984: We introduced the concept of Non-Constituency MP\r\n\r\nto  ensure that whatever the outcome of Parliamentary Elections,\r\n\r\nthere will be some opposition MPs in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1987: We introduced the Government Parliamentary\r\n\r\nCommittees (GPCs), and the GPCs, backed by resource panels, have\r\n\r\nbrought a sharper focus to debates in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1988: We established the concept of Group\r\n\r\nRepresentation  Constituency  to  ensure  that  Parliament  will\r\n\r\nalways have elected representatives from minority groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1990: We established the concept of Nominated MPs.\r\n\r\nNMPs  bring  to  Parliament  debates viewpoints  different  from\r\n\r\nGovernment  MPs  and  Opposition MPs.   In  the  same  year,  we\r\n\r\nestablished the institution of Elected President with  custodial\r\n\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Mr Speaker, while the British gave us a good\r\n\r\npolitical  system, we have not hesitated to shape and mould  our\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, our procedures and our institutions  to\r\n\r\ntake into account our political, cultural, social and democratic\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These innovations are complemented by similar steps outside\r\n\r\nParliament  which enable Singaporeans to be part  of  the  civic\r\n\r\nsociety  and  the  body politic.  Grassroots organisations  like\r\n\r\nCDCs, CCCs, RCs, Neighbourhood Committees, Town Councils and the\r\n\r\nFeedback Unit give\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthousands of Singaporeans a role to make Singapore a\r\n\r\nbetter place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Government, I want to\r\n\r\nexpress  our appreciation to past and present Members,  PAP  and\r\n\r\nnon-PAP,  for their contributions to our system of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  I also urge present and future Members to  build  on\r\n\r\nthe   accomplishments  of  their  predecessors.    Parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  has  worked  well  in  Singapore.   It  has  won  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of the electorate because of the integrity,  openness\r\n\r\nand  effectiveness  of  its  proceedings  and  the  honesty  and\r\n\r\ncompetence of MPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of this House, we must continue to strengthen it\r\n\r\nas  a  key  political  institution in Singapore.   We  have  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  ensure that the system  not  only  functions\r\n\r\neffectively  but  also serves the needs of our  people.   Public\r\n\r\nrespect  for  Parliament will be preserved  only  if  we,  their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, are worthy of their trust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. [Applause]\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you also for giving me this opportunity to speak\r\n\r\nbecause  I  am  only five months after the PM  in  joining  this\r\n\r\nParliament 22 years ago, and I guess this says a lot about that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years since our independence in 1965, this House has\r\n\r\nwitnessed  debates  of  all  major policies  introduced  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and legislation that gave effect to these  policies.\r\n\r\nThey  include  national service, health, education and  housing.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, we had to grapple with economic problems.  On\r\n\r\neach  occasion,  there was full debate not only on  the  general\r\n\r\nprinciples but also on details, much of which were dealt with by\r\n\r\nthe Select Committees set up for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOne outstanding feature of all these debates is that PAP\r\n\r\nbackbenchers took the initiatives to query Government Ministers\r\n\r\non all major aspects of these policies.  The lack of opposition\r\n\r\nin Parliament, which is no fault of the PAP, did not make the\r\n\r\ndebates less lively or substantial. Who can forget Mr Ho See\r\n\r\nBeng and the late Mr Fong Sip Chee who engaged virtually every\r\n\r\nMinister and made them work extra hard to answer their\r\n\r\nquestions.  Members may know that Mr Ng Kah Ting was the\r\n\r\nchampion for filing questions across all Ministries during\r\n\r\nBudget time.  Dr Augustine Tan regaled the House with his\r\n\r\ndiscourse on economics.  There was also Mr Lawrence Sia who took\r\n\r\non Dr Goh Keng Swee on matters of education.  Lucky for him, he\r\n\r\nwas always mistaken for Mr Sia Kah Hui.  That is why he stayed\r\n\r\non long after Mr Sia Kah Hui retired.  Even our Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nyourself, when you were a backbencher, was also noted for your\r\n\r\ncontributions until you were asked not to speak when you took on\r\n\r\nthis appointment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1990s, we are not short of outspoken MPs either. Dr\r\n\r\nTan  Cheng  Bock is a shining example.  Mr Peh Chin Hua  and  Mr\r\n\r\nHeng  Chiang  Meng  made  their marks and  took  the  Ministers'\r\n\r\n\"dressing down\" in their stride.  On the lighter side,  who  can\r\n\r\nforget  Members who were trying not to fall asleep in the House,\r\n\r\nand  for  those  who  did, were caught  by  the  very  efficient\r\n\r\nmicrophones in the sound system.  I hope the sound system in the\r\n\r\nnew  Parliament  would  not  be as good.   The  introduction  of\r\n\r\ntelevision, thankfully, put paid to this practice.   Although  a\r\n\r\nfew Members, I am told, still could not resist the urge and were\r\n\r\ncaught on the camera.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously, though, the debates in the House demonstrate\r\n\r\nwithout  a doubt that democracy is practised and is seen  to  be\r\n\r\npractised.   PAP  MPs have not been afraid to speak  out.   More\r\n\r\nthan  that,  they  have contributed fully to the  deliberations,\r\n\r\nregardless of the presence of Opposition MPs, NMPs or NCMPs.  As\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister has said, I am very confident that all of  us\r\n\r\nwould  take  with  us fond memories of this House  and  we  will\r\n\r\nreinforce our commitment to carry on this fine tradition to  the\r\n\r\nnew Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to speak on this motion moved by the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister which I fully support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its exalted 44 years of existence, this Chamber has\r\n\r\nwitnessed numerous tumultuous periods in Singapore's history.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognised that great and significant personalities,\r\n\r\nsuch  as past and present Speakers, Prime Ministers such  as  Mr\r\n\r\nLee  Kuan  Yew  and  Mr Goh Chok Tong, Ministers  and  MPs  have\r\n\r\nhonoured  this House with their memorable and historic speeches.\r\n\r\nEvery  single word uttered in this House was faithfully recorded\r\n\r\nin the Hansard.  This occasion of the \"Moving to New Chamber\" is\r\n\r\nindeed an appropriate occasion to honour all of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thought it would also be quite meaningful for me, as\r\n\r\na  backbencher,  to take this occasion to speak briefly  on  two\r\n\r\nissues.   The  first  is  the excellent parliamentary  democracy\r\n\r\nevolved and established in the past 44 years, and the second  is\r\n\r\nto  speak  in honour of the many backbenchers, past and present,\r\n\r\nwho  have  done  their fair share towards the  creation  of  our\r\n\r\nunique Singapore parliamentary process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As PAP MPs, in the typical tradition of Westminster\r\n\r\nParliamentary system, it should be our primary task to help  PAP\r\n\r\nMinisters  to  take on the Opposition MPs.  But because  of  the\r\n\r\nlack  in  number of Opposition MPs in this House in the past  25\r\n\r\nyears,  PAP backbenchers had the unusual task on many  occasions\r\n\r\nto   join  the  Opposition  side,  and  play  a  major  role  to\r\n\r\nscrutinise, and sometimes even critically comment on  Government\r\n\r\npolicies and Bills presented by Government Ministers.  In  fact,\r\n\r\ndue to the lack of seating places, the PAP MPs of Singapore have\r\n\r\nthis very un-Westminster format of sitting opposite and face-off\r\n\r\nour own Government Ministers.  Moreover, to allow for more focus\r\n\r\non  debates of the Ministerial portfolios, as the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas  said,  the  Government created the Government Parliamentary\r\n\r\nCommittees (GPC) so that PAP MPs can form into small  groups  to\r\n\r\nshadow various\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent Ministries.  In addition, we also created\r\n\r\nnon-elected MPs such as NCMPs and NMPs to provide more avenues\r\n\r\nfor debates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our parliamentary structure has indeed become a unique\r\n\r\nSingapore-style  parliamentary democracy.   These  changes  have\r\n\r\ncontributed to the confidence of the electorate to the  openness\r\n\r\nand  integrity of proceedings, as stated in the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nmotion.   It  is  a  proud Singapore tradition  that  should  be\r\n\r\ncarried through to the new Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Frontbench Prime Minister, Ministers and\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries are the initiators of the Government's\r\n\r\nprogrammes and improvements, therefore they rightly deserve  the\r\n\r\nrecognition,  I  feel that it is also very meaningful  for  this\r\n\r\nmotion  to record our appreciation for the contributions of  all\r\n\r\npast  Backbenchers,  both  from the  PAP  and  Opposition.   The\r\n\r\nBackbenchers are the unsung heroes who have equally  contributed\r\n\r\nto the exemplary and honourable image of this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from my past 15 years of membership of this august\r\n\r\nChamber,  I can recall many notable and memorable speeches  made\r\n\r\nby Backbenchers and Ministers.  In fact, my first year as Member\r\n\r\nof   this  House  in  March  1985  (some  14  years  ago),   the\r\n\r\nPresidential Debate was led by our colleague, Dr Tan Cheng Bock.\r\n\r\nHe  made  a remark that is still etched very deeply in my  mind.\r\n\r\nDr Tan advised us, novice Backbenchers then, \"to speak our minds\r\n\r\nand  let  conscience be our guide\", and never mind if you  incur\r\n\r\n\"parliamentary wounds\".  True to his words, Dr Tan has, to  this\r\n\r\nday, spoken his mind.  He has raised many significant issues for\r\n\r\ndebate  in  this  House.   He  has suffered  many  parliamentary\r\n\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Dr Tan, many Backbenchers have also spoken honestly\r\n\r\nand  boldly in this Chamber.  Mr Speaker, Sir, you yourself have\r\n\r\nbeen noted as a vocal Backbencher while you were sitting here on\r\n\r\nthis  side of the floor with us.  For PAP Backbenchers, in fact,\r\n\r\nit has not been an easy task\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeaking in this House as we have to do a fine\r\n\r\nbalancing act in crafting our speech, so as not to score \"own\r\n\r\ngoals\".  Sir, I feel that this aspect, which is for our\r\n\r\nBackbenchers to speak our mind, boldly ask questions and let\r\n\r\nconscience be our guide, has become an integral part of this\r\n\r\nunique and honourable parliamentary democracy created and\r\n\r\ninstitutionalised by all the past and present MPs in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the impending move to the new and modern Chamber next\r\n\r\ndoor, I am sure that the excellent traditions will continue  and\r\n\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the Prime Minister said that he has been in this House  for\r\n\r\n23  years.  I belong to the 1997 batch of MPs who are  here  for\r\n\r\nless  than three years.  In about three hours' time, all  of  us\r\n\r\nwill move from this Chamber to the one next door.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many Singaporeans, moving house is not new.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are used to moving house - they can make  money  in\r\n\r\nthe  process.  But to Parliament, this is the first time  in  40\r\n\r\nyears.   We  are  moving,  and we will bring  our  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  to  the  new Chamber and continue our  debate  there.\r\n\r\nOver  the  last  few  decades, every Bill, every  motion,  every\r\n\r\ndebate  that  took  place in this House  has  deeply  influenced\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The thought of this makes us realise how  heavy  our\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  are.  I support the Prime Minister's  move  to\r\n\r\nrecord  our sincere appreciation to the many MPs before  us  who\r\n\r\nhad contributed to our parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we march into the next millennium, let us review our\r\n\r\nhistory. Take a look at the world around us and we will discover\r\n\r\nthat  whether it was in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s or even the  90s,\r\n\r\nat  all  times there has always been the alternate emergence  of\r\n\r\ncrisis and opportunity, turmoil and stability, construction  and\r\n\r\ndestruction contrasting, yet co-existing with each other.   Some\r\n\r\nevents  took  place in remote corners of the  world  while  many\r\n\r\nother events took place right in front of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, 40 years ago, in the self-governing State\r\n\r\nof Singapore, when Mr Lee Kuan Yew led the new batch of\r\n\r\nAssemblymen from City Hall to this House, the thing which was\r\n\r\nuppermost in the minds of  Singaporeans then  was to obtain our\r\n\r\nindependence, to create employment and to overcome social\r\n\r\nturmoil.  The reason why we could turn crisis to opportunity,\r\n\r\nthat we could avoid turmoil and achieve stability, that we could\r\n\r\nchoose construction and avoid destruction, is because for the\r\n\r\nlast 40 years, we have debated thoroughly all policies in this\r\n\r\nHouse.  We have looked at all aspects of the policies and built\r\n\r\nup a healthy system of parliamentary democracy.  As MPs, we are\r\n\r\nglad that under this healthy system, we have confidently and\r\n\r\nconscientiously expressed our views.  In the last three years,\r\n\r\nwe  debated what we should be in the future - the Singapore 21\r\n\r\nprogramme.  With the sudden emergence of the economic crisis,\r\n\r\nour attention was diverted to how to protect the rice bowl of\r\n\r\nour workers and how to reduce costs.  In the face of unfriendly\r\n\r\npolitical development, we have not shied away from speaking our\r\n\r\nminds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new House, we will face new challenges in the new\r\n\r\ncentury.   We  will  debate on foreign  talents,  on  our  aging\r\n\r\npopulation,  on  how  to  deal  with  the  unfriendly   regional\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  how to tackle the ever changing  international\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   We will debate to protect our self-respect  and\r\n\r\nin  the  interest of Singaporeans.  We should practise  what  we\r\n\r\npreach.  We should execute what we plan.  And we should not  say\r\n\r\nsomething  that we cannot carry out.  In this way, we will  have\r\n\r\ngreater confidence in the process of parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we sit in the new House, we must not\r\n\r\nforget  the  great  contributions by the past  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people do not know where Parliament House is. They do\r\n\r\nnot realise that this very important Chamber is situated in such\r\n\r\nan  inconspicuous  building tucked away  at  a  corner  of  High\r\n\r\nStreet.  In fact, many people thought that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis Chamber was inside City Hall, a much more\r\n\r\nprominent building.   When we pointed out this building to them,\r\n\r\nthey would remark, \"Wah, so small!\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, indeed we started from small. It was from this\r\n\r\nChamber   in  this  inconspicuous  Parliament  House  that   our\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy  started.  Over  the  years,   we  have\r\n\r\nevolved  a  system  of  parliamentary  democracy  that  is  well\r\n\r\nrespected   by   all.   For  this,  we  must  not   forget   the\r\n\r\ncontributions made by all those Members of this House  who  came\r\n\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Prime Minister's motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Sir, for\r\n\r\nallowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, democracy denotes openness, transparency and\r\n\r\naccountability.  An authoritarian system does not  have  any  of\r\n\r\nthese  features.  I believe that a country must opt for  one  or\r\n\r\nthe  other  system, then we know what direction that country  is\r\n\r\nheading.  In the case of Singapore, we are uncertain whether  we\r\n\r\nare  taking the path towards democracy or towards a more  closed\r\n\r\nauthoritarian  system.  On the one hand,  we  say  that  we  are\r\n\r\nworking  towards  a more democratic system as our  children  are\r\n\r\ntaught  in  the  Pledge which they have to  take  every  day  at\r\n\r\nschool.   On  the other hand, we see that in actuality,  we  are\r\n\r\nbuilding a system that is more closed.  If we want to have  more\r\n\r\nopenness,  more transparency, and more accountability,  we  must\r\n\r\nhave  more Opposition in Parliament.  If the Opposition is weak,\r\n\r\nless than 5% representation in Parliament, the Government simply\r\n\r\nignores them.  The Government's attitude is \"what can they  do\",\r\n\r\nas  there  are  so  few  in  number.  The  Government  can  ride\r\n\r\nroughshod  over  a  weak Opposition and can get  away  with  it.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if  the  Opposition  is  strong,  say,  40%   or   45%\r\n\r\nrepresentation in Parliament, the Government will really have to\r\n\r\nbe on its toes.  It shall account for every detail of Government\r\n\r\npolicy  when  asked  to  do  so by the Opposition,  because  the\r\n\r\nOpposition has every chance of winning the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnext election if the Government does not perform as\r\n\r\nit is asked to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, in all developed countries, the electorate\r\n\r\nmake   sure  that  there  is  a  sizeable  Opposition  in  their\r\n\r\nparliaments  to check on the government and to keep  it  on  its\r\n\r\ntoes and to make sure that it performs well and efficiently  and\r\n\r\nnot to waste the country's resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we pay lip-service to the desire to build a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  society.  But in reality, we  do  not  see  it.   An\r\n\r\nimportant  aspect of a democratic society is to  have  effective\r\n\r\nOpposition  in  Parliament.  Without this important  element  in\r\n\r\nParliament,   a  country  cannot  be  said  to  be   democratic.\r\n\r\nEffective Opposition implies that there must be a core number of\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members in the House.  In Singapore, at the  moment,\r\n\r\nthere  are three Opposition Members - two elected and one  NCMP.\r\n\r\nIn   our  Singapore's  context,  three  Opposition  Members   in\r\n\r\nParliament are not enough, since politicians in Singapore, other\r\n\r\nthan  office-bearers, are part-timers.  And as such, they cannot\r\n\r\ndevote  as  much time as they would like to their  parliamentary\r\n\r\nwork or to probe or investigate thoroughly into the affairs of a\r\n\r\ngovernment.  In our context, after 34 years of independence,  it\r\n\r\nis  sad  to see that there are only three Opposition Members  in\r\n\r\nParliament.  I would say that to have an effective Opposition in\r\n\r\nParliament  today,  we  must  have  at  least  another  12  more\r\n\r\nOpposition Members.  The question is why there is an absence  or\r\n\r\neven  a  core number of Opposition Members in Parliament.    The\r\n\r\nanswer  is  obvious.   The  Government's  policy  is  never   to\r\n\r\nencourage   more  Opposition  in  Parliament.   In   fact,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  trying  hard  to  keep  the  Opposition  out  of\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at what happened after Anson in 1981. By-elections\r\n\r\nwere  never  called again, because normally at by-elections  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  has  a  better  chance of  winning.   Not  only  by-elections  were never called but they are permanently banned  in\r\n\r\nGRCs.  The law has been changed to make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit unnecessary to hold by-elections in GRCs in case\r\n\r\nany of their Members leave Parliament for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nThen, again, there is a change of election laws to bring in GRCs\r\n\r\nwhich is a great obstacle for the Opposition to overcome.  The\r\n\r\nOpposition so far has not been able to win any GRC seats because\r\n\r\nthey are unable to gather a group of candidates to match that of\r\n\r\nthe PAP's.  I believe that this obstacle put up by the PAP shall\r\n\r\nnot last long.  The Opposition needs only to capture one GRC and\r\n\r\nthe myth of the invincibility of the GRC shall be demolished\r\n\r\nafter that and more GRCs shall fall to the Opposition.  Then the\r\n\r\nPAP shall have to change the electoral laws again to keep the\r\n\r\nOpposition at bay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another device of the PAP to keep the Opposition out of\r\n\r\nParliament is to change the electoral boundaries.  We have  seen\r\n\r\nthat  done in many constituencies when the Opposition gets  high\r\n\r\nvotes  in  those constituencies.  The constituency  of  Braddell\r\n\r\nHeights  is  a  good  example.  Sin Kek Tong  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPeople's Party stood in that constituency in 1988 and 1991.  His\r\n\r\nvotes went as high as 48% in 1991.  He hoped to win the next  GE\r\n\r\nin  1997.   But  suddenly  that constituency  disappeared.   Its\r\n\r\nboundaries  were redrawn for it to be included in Marine  Parade\r\n\r\nGRC.  The Opposition is thus unable really to prepare the ground\r\n\r\nfor  the  next  election,  because the boundaries  can  suddenly\r\n\r\nchange  without  prior warning.  The Opposition  has  to  hit  a\r\n\r\nmoving target.  The PAP does not make it easy for the Opposition\r\n\r\nto win seats in Parliament.  If that is really the policy of the\r\n\r\nPAP  Government,  how can we say that we have made  progress  in\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  system of parliamentary democracy?   We  must  have\r\n\r\ngreater  number of Opposition Members in Parliament to establish\r\n\r\nmore effective checks and balances on the Government.  When this\r\n\r\nis  done,  then we can really say that we have established  true\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy.  The Government must take steps not  to\r\n\r\nimpede   the  growth  of  Opposition  in  Singapore.   Let   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  grow.   Let  it take root.  Let  the  Opposition  be\r\n\r\ninstitutionalised in Singapore.  So far, I cannot see such steps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing taken.  And, therefore, I cannot support the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since this is my last\r\n\r\nspeech in the House, I would like to begin by thanking the House\r\n\r\nand  the  Special  Select  Committee  Members  involved  in   my\r\n\r\nappointment for these slightly more than four years that I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  here.   It  has  been a privilege to  be  appointed  as  a\r\n\r\nNominated  Member and to be given the opportunity to  contribute\r\n\r\nto  the debate on a wide range of issues.  It has indeed been  a\r\n\r\nrich and rewarding experience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to congratulate my five colleagues who have\r\n\r\nbeen  re-appointed as well as the four new appointees and I wish\r\n\r\nthem all the best in the carrying out of their duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also particularly happy that I can participate in this\r\n\r\nhistoric move from the old to the new Chamber.  In my view,  the\r\n\r\nnew  Chamber is simply great.  It has a dignified elegance  that\r\n\r\nis  befitting Parliament.  I would also like to congratulate all\r\n\r\nthose,  including the Speaker, who had a hand in the development\r\n\r\nof the building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to focus on is how the overwhelming\r\n\r\nmajority  of the PAP has affected the functioning of  Parliament\r\n\r\nand  parliamentary democracy in Singapore.  Unlike some in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  I  only have a limited personal experience of  the  last\r\n\r\nfour  years  and  I  would  like to  speak  from  this  personal\r\n\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first function of the Legislature is to pass Bills and\r\n\r\nenact  laws.   In my view, this has been efficiently  performed.\r\n\r\nLaws  and budget are expeditiously passed and the majority  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has in the House ensures that it will carry  the\r\n\r\nvote  on  all  Bills and budgets.  That is the  very  nature  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second function is to act as an integrated focus for\r\n\r\nsociety.  Again, I feel that this has also been well performed.\r\n\r\nSuccessive PAP Governments have taken great pains to ensure\r\n\r\nminority racial representation in Parliament by means of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe GRC system.  Members also come from all walks of\r\n\r\nlife - Chinese-educated, English-educated, rich and poor family\r\n\r\nbackgrounds, professionals, entrepreneurs, corporate executives,\r\n\r\nacademics, young and old - the oldest Member is more than twice\r\n\r\nthe age of the youngest in the House.  What is only lacking is\r\n\r\ngreater female representation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is in the performance of the third function of\r\n\r\nParliament  as  a  forum for general debate  and  expression  of\r\n\r\nviews,  that  while there has been significant improvement  over\r\n\r\nthese  last  years, much more can still be done.   Increasingly,\r\n\r\npeople  in Singapore want a more consultative government.   This\r\n\r\nis  a natural consequence of the very economic success that  the\r\n\r\nPAP  has  helped  to  achieve  a more  educated  population  and\r\n\r\nglobalisation.   People  today want to  see  a  contestation  of\r\n\r\nideas, of alternatives, of different views expressed.  They  are\r\n\r\nno  longer content with top-down decision-making made by a small\r\n\r\nelite and implemented with the most perfunctory of explanations.\r\n\r\nIf  a certain course of policy is decided on, they would want to\r\n\r\nknow  why  or  why  not.   For example, why  the  need  for  the\r\n\r\nElectronic Road Pricing system? Why not compulsory education for\r\n\r\nchildren?  Why market the salaries for Ministers and  top  civil\r\n\r\nservants?   In  addition, they would like to  be  consulted  and\r\n\r\ngiven  inputs before and not after a policy decision.   Just  as\r\n\r\nthe  Government has responded to people's material needs in  the\r\n\r\npast, and has fulfilled them in proactive fashion, I would  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to meet this intangible but, nonetheless,  very\r\n\r\nreal political need for greater consultation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of ways to do so. Allow me just to\r\n\r\nfocus  on Parliament during this specific occasion.  Parliament,\r\n\r\ncomprising  the people's elected representatives, is indeed  the\r\n\r\ncentral  forum for open debate and expression of diverse  views.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result  of  the rich diversity of representation  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  views expressed by Members represent a microcosm of  the\r\n\r\nbroad spectrum of views in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does one need to have more Opposition Members for\r\n\r\nParliament to better fulfil this role?  The answer surely\r\n\r\ndepends on the quality of the Opposition, of existing\r\n\r\nbackbenchers and of the NMPs.  The Government backbenchers have,\r\n\r\nin the past, played the role of the loyal opposition.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nmany have asked good questions or offered useful suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Opposition, there is only so much that three\r\n\r\nOpposition Members can do.  And in fact, the number of  NMPs  is\r\n\r\ntriple  that of the Opposition Members.  The NMPs, as  a  group,\r\n\r\nhave  also been active.  For example, from the beginning of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  NMP  term  to  this  sitting,  NMPs  accounted  for   a\r\n\r\ndisproportionate 38% of the 712 Questions filed, PAP  MPs  filed\r\n\r\n44%  of the Questions and Opposition MPs, 18%.  My view is  that\r\n\r\nso  long  as  the Opposition MPs, as a group, do not  offer  the\r\n\r\nrange and quality of constructive dissent and alternative policy\r\n\r\nproposals that are desired, NMPs can, and have, served a  useful\r\n\r\nrole by filling this void.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another aspect: that of the effectiveness of\r\n\r\nparliamentary proceedings in facilitating such debate.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to offer three proposals as to how to improve Parliamentary\r\n\r\nproceedings  so  that Parliament can be an even  more  effective\r\n\r\nchannel for the voicing of alternative views in the future.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  proposal  I have is to increase the length  of  the  time\r\n\r\nallotted  for  Oral  Answers to Questions.  Questions  for  Oral\r\n\r\nAnswer serve an important purpose.  They enable Members to  seek\r\n\r\nclarification  on  issues of the day.  The one  hour  is  almost\r\n\r\ninvariably  not  enough to cover all the  questions  asked.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  I think that today is an exception, rather than the rule.\r\n\r\nMembers  can  file Questions for Written Answer.  But,  however,\r\n\r\nthis  does not allow opportunity for debate, to pursue the issue\r\n\r\nfurther  by asking supplementary questions, and so on.   Another\r\n\r\nalternative is to file a motion.  But, for example, how does one\r\n\r\nfile  a  motion  on the SilkAir crash?  Members  can  also  seek\r\n\r\nclarification  during the Committee of Supply  debate  but  that\r\n\r\noccurs only once a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would therefore like to propose that the time\r\n\r\nallotted for Oral Answer be increased from one hour to one and a\r\n\r\nhalf hours in the first instance.  While this might still not\r\n\r\nenable all Questions filed to be answered, that would at least\r\n\r\nallow, on average, 50% more Questions to be covered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second proposal is that Parliament allows for speeches\r\n\r\nto  be  supplemented by audio-visual aids.  This has become  the\r\n\r\nnorm   in   the   business  world  as  well  as  in  educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   I am glad that the new Chamber  is  fitted  with\r\n\r\nelectric sockets for computer notebooks to be plugged in as well\r\n\r\nas  screens.  And surely, the House would agree with me  that  a\r\n\r\nspeech   accompanied  by  a  PowerPoint  presentation  is   more\r\n\r\ninteresting, easier to absorb and more effective than  just  the\r\n\r\nspeech alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third proposal is that the GPCs play a more active role\r\n\r\nin  the consultation and feedback process.  These views can then\r\n\r\nbe  aired  in  the House during the relevant policy  debate,  as\r\n\r\nindeed has been done in the case of the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point and, perhaps, the most important, is that the\r\n\r\nfundamental  tenet  of  democracy is  that  it  must  bring  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  good  to  the  greatest number  of  people.   The  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment has, without doubt, progressively raised the standard\r\n\r\nof  living of ordinary people, of the man-in-the-street, and has\r\n\r\ncreated  opportunities for self-advancement because of education\r\n\r\nand  economic growth.  Having observed proceedings in the  House\r\n\r\nat first hand, I can say that I have full trust in the integrity\r\n\r\nof  its  proceedings.  This is certainly an important legacy  to\r\n\r\nbring  to  the new Chamber.  What I would like to  see  is  that\r\n\r\nfuller  expression  be  given  to people's  desire  for  greater\r\n\r\nconsultation and feedback and the airing of alternative views in\r\n\r\nthe  House.   My  wish is that in the first decade  of  the  new\r\n\r\nmillennium there is an even more significant shift towards  more\r\n\r\nconsultative government in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have, as you know, an\r\n\r\namendment to the motion.  But as I did at the last sitting,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to say a few words before I move my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, did I misread the motion on the Order\r\n\r\nPaper?    I  thought  we  were  going  to  debate  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  But we heard this afternoon, Mr Speaker, Sir, hardly\r\n\r\nanything about parliamentary democracy.  We have been treated to\r\n\r\nspeeches  after  speeches of how good the  previous  Parliaments\r\n\r\nhave  been,  how effective, how they have had men of  integrity,\r\n\r\nand  so on, but not a word about parliamentary democracy except,\r\n\r\nI must hasten to say, for the speech from Mr Chiam See Tong from\r\n\r\nthe Opposition bench.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion is wrong for two reasons.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it displays and, I am sorry that I have to ascribe this\r\n\r\nto  the  Prime  Minister who has moved the  motion,  a  complete\r\n\r\nignorance   or   inability  to  understand  what   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy is all about.  As I listened to him, I began to  think\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Prime  Minister was saying is that we  have  our  own\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy, parliamentary democracy ala  Singapore\r\n\r\nand we are not interested in what others mean when they talk  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy.  So I say this motion is wrong because,\r\n\r\nif  he  intended  it to be the Singapore style of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy, then it should have said so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that a House consisting almost\r\n\r\nentirely  of PAP Members is the wrong place to debate  a  motion\r\n\r\npraising  the  previous Governments and Members  of  Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou  will get your pat on the back, there is no doubt about  it.\r\n\r\nNo  one  will  imagine  for a minute that this  motion  will  be\r\n\r\ndefeated.  You will get your pat.  But this is not the place  to\r\n\r\ncome for an appraisal.  If you want an appraisal, I say, let  us\r\n\r\nhave  an open debate outside where Singaporeans will be able  to\r\n\r\nattend and pass their judgement.  If you are seriously concerned\r\n\r\nand  interested  in  this question, may  I  say  that  the  Open\r\n\r\nSingapore  Centre will only be too pleased to arrange  a  public\r\n\r\ndebate  on the question of parliamentary democracy in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWould you accept it and would you come and speak there so that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans can then make their judgement?  I have\r\n\r\nnot got very much time, Mr Speaker, Sir, so I better move my\r\n\r\namendment and speak on the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that the motion before the\r\n\r\nHouse  be  amended  by  deleting all words following  the  words\r\n\r\n\"across the yard\", and in place of those words, to insert -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"regrets the persistent attempts and measures of the\r\n\r\ngovernments  since  1965  to  impede  the  growth   of   genuine\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy and urges the present government to take\r\n\r\nsuch  measures as may be necessary to facilitate the  growth  of\r\n\r\ngenuine parliamentary democracy in Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I said that this speech of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and the motion itself display stark ignorance  of  what\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy  is.   Parliamentary  democracy  is   a\r\n\r\nconcept that we have borrowed from other countries, particularly\r\n\r\nfrom  the  United Kingdom whose style of government we chose  to\r\n\r\nadopt  in 1955.  And so we have to look to them as to what  they\r\n\r\nunderstood  as  parliamentary democracy.  If  we  are  going  to\r\n\r\nredefine  that term, then we should make it quite clear  to  the\r\n\r\nworld  at large that parliamentary democracy, as they understand\r\n\r\nit,  is not what we understand it. Singapore's understanding  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy is this, this and this.  Then,  we  will\r\n\r\nbe at least making ourselves plain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, parliamentary democracy implies and\r\n\r\npresupposes that Parliament is the centre of power.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nsupreme  authority in the country representing the people.   Let\r\n\r\nus  not  forget, and we will be reminding our people  again  and\r\n\r\nagain  in the years to come, that they are the masters and  this\r\n\r\nHouse is a gathering of their representatives.  The sine qua non\r\n\r\nof   parliamentary   democracy  is  that  the   executive,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, is answerable and accountable to Parliament.  May  I\r\n\r\nquote   from  the  International  Encyclopedia  of  the   Social\r\n\r\nSciences:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Parliamentary government is the form of constitutional\r\n\r\ndemocracy  in  which  executive authority emerges  from  and  is\r\n\r\nresponsible to legislative authority.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quoted a writer, a Frenchman, who wrote in the\r\n\r\nJournal British Political System in London in 1958 but it is\r\n\r\nworth quoting it again.  I quoted it the last sitting and this\r\n\r\nis what he has to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If asked to give a single criterion of the democratic\r\n\r\ngovernment,  I  should say that it depended  on  the  status  of\r\n\r\nopposition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A book on Opposition by a professor of government in\r\n\r\nManchester  University, Ghita Ionescu and  a  reader  at  London\r\n\r\nUniversity, Isabel de Madariaga have this to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Political opposition thus becomes the crowning institution\r\n\r\nof  a fully institutionalised political society and the hallmark\r\n\r\nof   those  political  societies  which  are  variously   called\r\n\r\ndemocratic,  liberal, parliamentary, constitutional, pluralistic\r\n\r\nconstitutional  or  even open or free.   Thus  the  presence  or\r\n\r\nabsence of institutionalised political opposition can become the\r\n\r\ncriterion for the classification of any political society in one\r\n\r\nof  two  categories  -   liberal or dictatorial,  democratic  or\r\n\r\nauthoritarian, pluralistic constitutional or monolithic?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do we place Singapore in that classification? Can we\r\n\r\ntruly  say  that  Singapore is liberal, democratic,  pluralistic\r\n\r\nconstitutional,  if you accept the criterion  for  a  democratic\r\n\r\nsociety?   Or  is  Singapore, on the  other  hand,  dictatorial,\r\n\r\nauthoritarian,  monolithic?   The  authors  of  that  book,   in\r\n\r\nreference  to the change in societies mention another quotation,\r\n\r\nthat  the  transition  from an archaic  society  into  a  modern\r\n\r\nsociety  began  sometime in the 18th century.  Is  Singapore  an\r\n\r\narchaic  society  or  a modern society?  An archaic  society  is\r\n\r\nwhere  it  still  retains the feudal system of  government  with\r\n\r\nauthority  being the key plank in the government.   Can  we,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, say that we are a parliamentary democracy?  If it is,\r\n\r\nas  we say about justice, government must be and must manifestly\r\n\r\nbe  seen to be answerable and accountable to Parliament.  How is\r\n\r\nthis  possible - manifestly seen to be answerable to  Parliament\r\n\r\nwhen Parliament consists of almost 95% of the ruling party?   It\r\n\r\nis just nonsense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we say that in Singapore, all these years, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has accounted itself to Parliament?   We  only  had,\r\n\r\nsome months ago, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaying that he did not have to report a loan to\r\n\r\nIndonesia to Parliament, promising to give away some millions of\r\n\r\nSingapore dollars as Parliament did not have to be told about\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the factors that have prevented the growth of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy in Singapore?  I will list them and,  if\r\n\r\ntime permits, say a few words on each of them.  First of all, it\r\n\r\nis  the  climate  of  fear in Singapore of  which  I  have  been\r\n\r\nspeaking more than once, the fear generated through the Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Act (ISA) and victimisation of those who would dare  to\r\n\r\nstand  up and take the Government to task.  It is also generated\r\n\r\nthrough  the  numbering of the ballot papers  and  entering  the\r\n\r\nserial numbers on the counterfoils.  Secondly, the denial of the\r\n\r\nfreedoms  vital  to the growth of parliamentary  democracy,  the\r\n\r\ndenial  of  the  freedom of expression and assembly,  making  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  democratic institutions to  grow  and  function.\r\n\r\nThirdly,  denying  a  level playing  field  in  the  conduct  of\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in all countries, and particularly in the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  countries, which have inherited the  system,  they\r\n\r\nhave  an elections commission.  We in the Opposition called  for\r\n\r\nan elections commission way back in the 70s, and to this day, we\r\n\r\nstill  do  not  have an elections commission.   The  conduct  of\r\n\r\nelections  has  remained  and  is  still  the  monopoly  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   And so we have had gerrymandering  at  its  worst.\r\n\r\nThe altering and redrawing of electoral boundaries, creation  of\r\n\r\nGRCs  at  just the will of the Prime Minister or the leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  without  any  consultation  with  the  people  or  the\r\n\r\nOpposition parties.  Making it difficult for the ordinary person\r\n\r\nto  stand  as  a  Member  of  Parliament  if  he  can  meet  the\r\n\r\nqualifications, by raising the deposits for candidates  so  that\r\n\r\nonly  the  wealthy  and  the  rich can  stand  for  election  to\r\n\r\nParliament.   The persecution of opposition leaders and  parties\r\n\r\ndenying  them  a  place  in the sun in  Singapore.   Prosecuting\r\n\r\nOpposition  leaders  if  they wish to address  the  public,  the\r\n\r\naudience, denying them licences to hold any public meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then curtailing the freedom of Members of\r\n\r\nParliament.  After my presence in this House from 1981 to 1986,\r\n\r\nor following it, Bills were introduced to curtail the freedom of\r\n\r\nthe Members in this House, introducing even the power to commit\r\n\r\nMembers to prison if they dare to step out of line and abuse\r\n\r\ntheir privileges in the view of the majority of the Members,\r\n\r\nsomething which the UK Parliament has now abolished.  It has\r\n\r\nnever resorted to this but we have it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not flatter ourselves that we as a society have\r\n\r\nconsciously  sought  to  encourage the growth  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy in this country.  There are steps necessary that  have\r\n\r\nto be taken for the growth of parliamentary democracy. Time does\r\n\r\nnot  permit me to go into them at length, but clearly  it  calls\r\n\r\nfor  the abolition of the power to detain persons without  trial\r\n\r\nfor  political  activities and equally, a need to  look  at  the\r\n\r\nCriminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act to see whether  that  is\r\n\r\nnecessary. Secondly, we need to consider whether there should be\r\n\r\na  restriction on public meetings especially called by political\r\n\r\nparties,  whether that is still necessary. Thirdly, we have  got\r\n\r\nto consider whether we should continue with the numbering of the\r\n\r\nballot  papers  and  the  requirement  for  serial  numbers   on\r\n\r\ncounterfoils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say all this is necessary because they will then, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, remove the fear that is acting as a paralysis  on\r\n\r\nour  people  preventing  the growth of parliamentary  democracy.\r\n\r\nThese  are measures that cannot be taken immediately. They would\r\n\r\nhave  to  be taken over a period of time and it would  be  quite\r\n\r\nsome  time before our people are disabused of fear, assured that\r\n\r\nit  is  their bounden duty and right to take an interest and  to\r\n\r\ntake  part  in the affairs of the country.  But may I  tell  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  if  I may, before I sit down,  that  there  is\r\n\r\nsomething  he  can do immediately so that we,  the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  can go into 21st century saying we  are  or  we  are\r\n\r\nbeginning  to  be a parliamentary democracy.  We  can  hold  our\r\n\r\nheads  high.   This  can be done if the Prime  Minister  decides\r\n\r\nafter all that there should be a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby-election now before we run into the next century.\r\n\r\nThere is a vacancy and if this Government believes that it has\r\n\r\nthe trust and confidence of the people which has led to it being\r\n\r\nelected election after election, then why hold back now?  Now is\r\n\r\nthe time for this Government to show Singaporeans and the world\r\n\r\nthat this Government is serious.  This Government means business\r\n\r\nwhen it says that we want to be a parliamentary democracy.  If\r\n\r\nyou, Mr Prime Minister, will take that step now and call for a\r\n\r\nby-election, I tell you that the world will salute you, as a\r\n\r\nbeliever in parliamentary democracy.  If you do not, you will go\r\n\r\ndown in history as one who is frightened to introduce\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, and still  holding on to your power to\r\n\r\nsee that the PAP is not eventually replaced.  Because, in a\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, it goes without saying that the people\r\n\r\nhave the right and it should be seen that they do have the right\r\n\r\nto replace a government, through the ballot box.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members have talked of fair elections. I could go on\r\n\r\nat  length  about the kind of elections we have had in Singapore\r\n\r\nsince  1971, when I entered into politics.  We have never had  a\r\n\r\nlevel playing field.  And it is a pretence to talk that we are a\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy  when  you  go  all  out  to  deny  the\r\n\r\nopposition  a place in Parliament.  As these authors have  said,\r\n\r\nit  is  only  when  you have a sufficient number  of  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers   in   Parliament,  then  you  become  a   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  Without Opposition Members in sufficient number, you\r\n\r\nare  nothing  but an authoritarian government, passing  measures\r\n\r\nand  policies, not with consultation of the people, but  because\r\n\r\nyou  think  it is right for the people.  This denies the  people\r\n\r\ntheir  place.  It is the people who have to make the judgements,\r\n\r\nand  that  is  only possible if you have Opposition  Members  in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been suggestions from the Nominated MP that the\r\n\r\nOpposition has to be effective.  Of course, it has  to  be.   No\r\n\r\none denies that.  But if you, the ruling party, go all out using\r\n\r\nextra parliamentary measures to keep Opposition Members out, how\r\n\r\ncan you claim praise for your\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparty?  It is only by a fair battle won by  you  by\r\n\r\nfair  and  lawful  means that you can claim to be  a  democratic\r\n\r\ngovernment.  Until that happens, I am afraid, Singapore will  be\r\n\r\nclassified, as they have said, as an archaic society.   We  have\r\n\r\nmade great progress in other fields  -  information,  technology\r\n\r\n-  but as a political society, we are still in the 18th century.\r\n\r\nIs  it  not  time   we moved forward and began  the  journey  to\r\n\r\nbecoming a full parliamentary democracy?\r\n\r\n<br>3.35 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question before the House is the amendment\r\n\r\nmoved  by  Mr J B Jeyaretnam.

The\r\n\r\npeople must have the ultimate right to choose their\r\n\r\nparliamentary representatives and the people to form the\r\n\r\ngovernment, through the process of election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representatives elected by the people shall form\r\n\r\nParliament  which  is the legislative body of  the  State.   The\r\n\r\npolitical  party that wins the most seats in a General  Election\r\n\r\nwill  form the Government to rule the country. The ruling  party\r\n\r\ncan  only implement policies or carry out resolutions which have\r\n\r\nbeen  passed by Parliament.   Parliament is the main  pillar  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  checks  and  balances on the  Government  under  the\r\n\r\nframework  of division of the three powers under the  system  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the system of parliamentary democracy to be effectively\r\n\r\nimplemented,  three important pre-conditions must be present:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the people must be able to elect the people\r\n\r\naccording  to their own wishes, without being subjected  to  any\r\n\r\nthreat of losing any of their benefits.  They must be allowed to\r\n\r\nexercise  their  own free choices without any  psychological  or\r\n\r\nmental pressure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, at the elections, the people should have\r\n\r\ndifferent candidates from whom they can exercise their right  of\r\n\r\nselection.   Most  importantly,  the  media,  particularly   the\r\n\r\ntelevision,  should accord fair coverage of the candidates  from\r\n\r\nthe   various  parties,  so  that  the  voters  will  have   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  have  a  clear  understanding  of  the  various\r\n\r\ncandidates  through  introduction by the media and other  means,\r\n\r\nand hence make informed decisions when they cast their votes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there must be enough number of Members from the\r\n\r\nvarious  parties in Parliament, with full power to vote  for  or\r\n\r\nagainst  the  motions introduced by the Government, particularly\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Government is seeking to amend the Constitution.   At\r\n\r\nthe same time, there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould be enough non-ruling party Members  in\r\n\r\nParliament  with enough influence to challenge the ruling\r\n\r\nparties during voting, to ensure that  the ruling party will not\r\n\r\nsacrifice the interest of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any country that professes to practise parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  if  it  does  not possess  all  these  three  above-mentioned   pre-conditions,  then  the  so-called  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy   exists   in   name   only.    Unfortunately,   since\r\n\r\nindependence, Singapore's parliamentary democracy is actually in\r\n\r\na \"partly-nominal, partly-solid\" state.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we do have the parliamentary democracy system, and\r\n\r\nthe  three key institutions: the Judiciary, the  Legislature and\r\n\r\nthe  Executive,  and  the  people do have  the  right  to  elect\r\n\r\nMembers to form  Parliament, the actual situation is that during\r\n\r\nthe  election,  we do not have enough opposition  candidates  to\r\n\r\ncontest  the  election,  and  the  PAP  can  actually  form  the\r\n\r\nGovernment even before the polling date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workers' Party firmly believes in the importance of\r\n\r\nParliament  exercising its power of checks and balances  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment under the system of parliamentary democracy.  We also\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  under  the system of parliamentary  democracy,\r\n\r\nthe voters must have a choice of candidates to give full play to\r\n\r\nthe  elections.  For this reason,  the Workers' Party  has  been\r\n\r\nfielding   candidates   in   every   General   Election    since\r\n\r\nindependence.  Although we lost again and again, we have carried\r\n\r\non contesting, and we never gave up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the contested constituencies, almost 40% of the voters\r\n\r\nsupported  the  opposition, but the vast majority of  opposition\r\n\r\ncandidates  were not returned.  As a result, the  PAP  has  been\r\n\r\ndominating Parliament and, at the same time, controls  the  main\r\n\r\npillars   of  Legislative  and  Executive  in  the   system   of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of today, the system of parliamentary democracy has been\r\n\r\npractised in Singapore for more than 30 years.   Why is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit that we are still in such a situation?  Why is it\r\n\r\nthat Parliament has not been able to perform the role of checks\r\n\r\nand balances on the Government to see to it that the Government\r\n\r\nwould not have its own way all the time, and thereby protect the\r\n\r\noverall interest of the nation and the people?    There is even\r\n\r\nthe need for the Government to introduce this nondescript system\r\n\r\nof Elected Presidency, which is not guaranteed to be effective,\r\n\r\nto safeguard the national reserves.  I feel that this is\r\n\r\nsomething which anyone who is concerned with the future of\r\n\r\nSingapore should ponder over seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system of parliamentary democracy has been in force in\r\n\r\nSingapore for more than 30 years, and we are still having a one-party  rule in Singapore.  The Secretary-General of the Workers'\r\n\r\nParty has already made some analysis on the matter just now.   I\r\n\r\ndo  not  want to repeat his points.  But here, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nmake  the  point that a legitimate government which is generated\r\n\r\nunder a system of parliamentary democracy has the obligation  to\r\n\r\nensure   the   existence   of  the  three   pre-conditions   for\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy, to give full play  to  the  system  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy.  At the same time,  this  will  ensure\r\n\r\nthe legitimacy of the Government as generated under this system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a time, people have asked me whether the PAP had\r\n\r\ncheated  in  the general elections.  I said that as far  as  the\r\n\r\nvotes  are concerned, the PAP had not cheated.  If they  had,  I\r\n\r\nwould  not  have  participated in politics through  the  General\r\n\r\nElections.   However,  the  PAP has  earned  for  itself  a  bad\r\n\r\nreputation  by  unfairly  changing  the   election  rules,   and\r\n\r\nthreatening  the people during the elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important characteristic of the system of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy is that we must have representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  from the various quarters to voice their  views  in\r\n\r\nParliament,  so that the Government, in ruling the nation,  will\r\n\r\nlook  after the interest of the entire society.  In this  system\r\n\r\nof  parliamentary democracy, it is a presumption that there will\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na ruling party and an opposition in Parliament.  But\r\n\r\nif the ruling party can make good use of the feedback and\r\n\r\nalternative views from the various opposition parties, I think\r\n\r\nit will make a more effective government.  On top of that, if it\r\n\r\nis subjected to the pressure of the opposition, it will be more\r\n\r\nprudent when it implements its policies to show that it is a\r\n\r\ngood government.  As such, the effect of parliamentary democracy\r\n\r\nis not just a confrontation between political parties.  In fact,\r\n\r\nthis system has substantial effects in promoting a good\r\n\r\ngovernment which takes good care of its people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have dwelt at length on our parliamentary democracy,\r\n\r\nand  it  may  appear as though I am \"displaying my little  skill\r\n\r\nbefore  the grand-masters\".  However, at this historical  moment\r\n\r\nof  the  moving of our Parliament, there is no harm in reviewing\r\n\r\nour  past, with the hope that we may draw some inspiration  from\r\n\r\nthere  to improve ourselves, so that the system of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  in Singapore may develop in a more healthy manner  in\r\n\r\nthe new Parliament House, to protect the future happiness of our\r\n\r\npeople.   At  the  same time, let the academics in  the  western\r\n\r\nsociety  know that even after the autocratic Prime Minister  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew  has left us, Singapore can still continue to  survive\r\n\r\nand develop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That the words proposed to be left out,\r\n\r\nbe left out.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I call for a division.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member has called for a division.

We shall miss all these.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what lives on are the many memories of the debates\r\n\r\nleft  by  batches  of  MPs in the last 30  over  years  who  had\r\n\r\ncumulatively   struggled   to  define   and   hone   Singapore's\r\n\r\nparliamentary  framework.   Some of us had the good  fortune  of\r\n\r\nhearing some of these debates orally shared, but  most of us had\r\n\r\nto read the Hansard to access the rich historical records of who\r\n\r\nsaid what, when, how and why.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What endured out of the copious textual testimonies was a\r\n\r\nspirit,   call  it  the  Singapore  Spirit,   which   vigorously\r\n\r\nquestioned the Western view of democracy and called  for  a  re-reading  of democratic principles based on our own understanding\r\n\r\nof  what  fitted  better the development of  our  multi-cultural\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As separate individuals we may debate the claims of\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  but we must all recognise that under the stewardship\r\n\r\nof  this  Government, and as a people,  we  have  achieved  many\r\n\r\nthings  that  we  are  all proud of - public housing,  universal\r\n\r\neducation, equal opportunity, and  meritocracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Policies of good governance did not happen overnight; they\r\n\r\nwere  carefully deliberated inside and outside of this House  as\r\n\r\nwell  as arduously tested outside of this Parliament by each  MP\r\n\r\nserving  as  a champion, an articulator, a feedback  channel,  a\r\n\r\nfacilitator and a custodian of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe interests of  his or her constituents.   It is\r\n\r\nthis democratizing process of political persuasion, of having to\r\n\r\nwin the consent of Singaporeans at all levels, that makes our\r\n\r\nsystem of parliamentary democracy tick.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure having more political parties or NMPs will\r\n\r\ncreate  more  accountability  and necessarily  enrich  political\r\n\r\nlife.   In  abstraction, opposition is a good check and balance.\r\n\r\nIn  practice,  it is not self-evident.  We have  many  countries\r\n\r\naround us that show that dissonance.  Having said that, I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  important that future leaders listen to dissenting views\r\n\r\nand  give  time  to  process, explain,  persuade  and  sometimes\r\n\r\ninstead  be  persuaded.  For me, this respect and tolerance  for\r\n\r\ndifferences  and  providing channels  for  negotiations  form  a\r\n\r\nfundamental democractic ethos.  Future Members have to  continue\r\n\r\nthis  grave  responsibility of  governance  by  deepening   this\r\n\r\ndemocratic  ethos.  They need new solutions to meet  the  rising\r\n\r\ndemands  among the emerging voters who have grown accustomed  to\r\n\r\ndemocratic  expectations.  They need fresh strategies  to  reach\r\n\r\nout  to  the Y generation, the Internet \"click\" generation  born\r\n\r\nafter l977 who are both cosmopolitan and heartlander in outlook.\r\n\r\nTheir   horizons  span the world for material  gains  but  their\r\n\r\nemotions  are  deeply rooted in Singapore and its  cultural  and\r\n\r\nculinary  diversity, including  \"singlish\", \"mee pok\",  \"laksa\",\r\n\r\nand \"roti prata\".  They are restless and seek new definitions of\r\n\r\nwhat  matters  and what counts in  \"a good life\".   Promises  of\r\n\r\nmaterial  gains are no longer sufficient for community building,\r\n\r\nour   future  MPs  have  to  nurture  heartware  components   in\r\n\r\nrelationship building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the mix of paternalistic and consultative\r\n\r\nleadership style, I hope to see  a greater co-partnering form of\r\n\r\ndemocracy   characterised  by  various   stakeholders   actively\r\n\r\nlearning  to  decide and act together as equal  partners.   This\r\n\r\nwould  mean  minimising  power play and enhancing   constructive\r\n\r\nexchanges   that  are  unfettered  by  officious  postures   and\r\n\r\nbureaucratic  practices.   Citizens  do  not  just  want  to  be\r\n\r\nconsulted.  They  want  to work together  with  state  agencies.\r\n\r\nMaybe, even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake charge.  Are our future leaders ready to let up\r\n\r\nwithout letting go?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The millennium leadership of MPs calls for a blend of\r\n\r\nreason  and  intuition,  where rationality  and  creativity  can\r\n\r\nmerge to produce positive synergies.  Our pioneers have given us\r\n\r\nmany pointers and a  legacy to follow -  the challenge to future\r\n\r\nleaders  is: what can we do more  to enhance Singaporeans' sense\r\n\r\nof relevance and citizenship?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people sector may not have definitive proposals just\r\n\r\nyet,  but a dynamic mindset on the part of  the leaders who  are\r\n\r\nresponsive to  diversity and change is a good start.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will always treasure this moment of being part of\r\n\r\nthe  history of this House.  I hope more women will step forward\r\n\r\nin  the  new millennium to serve  in the new Chamber across  the\r\n\r\nyard.    I  urge  future Members to continue to  address  issues\r\n\r\naffecting the family and women just as seriously as they  debate\r\n\r\neconomic issues, and identify appropriate policies for promoting\r\n\r\na  balance  in maximising  the potential of  men and  women  for\r\n\r\nnation-building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that as a people we will pull our minds,\r\n\r\nhearts  and spirit together to make the Singapore pulse tick  in\r\n\r\nunison.   This  confidence is built on credible achievements  of\r\n\r\npast Members.  I once  again register my gratitude to them   and\r\n\r\nI  hereby  also  pledge my commitment to serve our  people  with\r\n\r\nhonour and integrity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nInformation and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  rise  to  support the motion made in the name  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I speak on the motion, I would like to say that\r\n\r\nI  am  rather puzzled by Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam's approach  to  our\r\n\r\nparliamentary  debate.  He and Mr Low  Thia Khiang  have  chosen\r\n\r\nthe  occasion  of this debate to introduce an amendment  to  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's motion to trot out all his old grievances  and\r\n\r\nallegations against\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Government and PAP, for example, the ISA,\r\n\r\nnumbered ballot votes, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the amendment is totally unnecessary and\r\n\r\nappropriately  defeated a moment ago.  I say it  is  unnecessary\r\n\r\nbecause  he could have made his points and comments by  speaking\r\n\r\non the main motion.  Mr Chiam did just that and had achieved his\r\n\r\nobjective  without having to introduce any amendment.   All  his\r\n\r\ncomments  would have been made in the context of the  debate  on\r\n\r\nthe main motion.  It appears to me that his amendment is another\r\n\r\nof  his  attempts  to play to the gallery.  So  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nappropriate that this Chamber dismisses his theatrics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, parliamentary democracy was introduced to Singapore\r\n\r\nabout  44  years  ago.   Compared  to  many  other  Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries which had adopted the Westminster parliamentary system\r\n\r\nas   their   model,  Singapore's  experience  in   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  is quite recent, yet we have turned it into something\r\n\r\nunique.  Within this short period, we have succeeded in evolving\r\n\r\na  parliamentary  democracy system into an institution  that  is\r\n\r\nable  to  meet our needs and bring Singapore into  the  path  of\r\n\r\nrapid progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the underlying reason that made our parliamentary\r\n\r\nsystem  workable is quite straightforward.  The  system  enables\r\n\r\nour  political leaders to apply their creative mind,  anticipate\r\n\r\nchallenges  and  introduce changes.  In  other  words,  we  have\r\n\r\nturned  the  system  to  something that  is  responsive  to  the\r\n\r\nchanging circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, an institution is a neutral vehicle for man to\r\n\r\nachieve  progress.   The  same applies  to  the  institution  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy.  However, institution per se,  left  in\r\n\r\nthe hands of non-creative, unimaginative minds, would not be  of\r\n\r\nmuch   use  or  much  benefit.   Experience  in  many  countries\r\n\r\npractising  parliamentary  democracy  had  shown  that   social,\r\n\r\nhistorical  and  other man-made constraints  had  inhibited  the\r\n\r\nconstructive  growth of the system, thus leaving  the  countries\r\n\r\nconcerned struggling.  Some are even 'condemned'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto live in poverty while others are making very slow\r\n\r\nprogress towards development.  The political benefits that are\r\n\r\nexpected to be delivered by the system of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy for countries mentioned above came in drips.  In this\r\n\r\nrespect, whether the institution of parliamentary democracy is\r\n\r\nable to raise the status of the country very much depends on\r\n\r\nwhether there are right men and women to manage the institution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I totally disagree with the views expressed by the\r\n\r\nOpposition  that you need to have more opposition in  Parliament\r\n\r\nto  make it democratically operational.  An institution  can  be\r\n\r\nvery  powerful,  constructive and effective  because  there  are\r\n\r\nindividuals  who have chosen to use the institution  creatively,\r\n\r\nhonourably  and wisely.  For us in Singapore, the  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy institution has been used by our leaders as a means to\r\n\r\nimplement  their ideas and to promote values that  will  enhance\r\n\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, other countries have similar institution but\r\n\r\ndue to their poor understanding of its potential or shackled  by\r\n\r\ntheir historical, social or cultural conditions, the institution\r\n\r\nitself is turned into a platform for ideological conflicts  with\r\n\r\nadversaries using it as a platform for contention rather than as\r\n\r\na  means  to achieve consensus and pave the way towards progress\r\n\r\nand development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Singapore is concerned, we have chosen the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democratic system as a means  to  provide  higher\r\n\r\nstandard  of living to Singaporeans.  Critics may say  that  our\r\n\r\nparliamentary system appears to them as very much  dominated  by\r\n\r\nthe  government  of the day, ie, the PAP.  This is  quite  true.\r\n\r\nThey  have  also claimed further that such dominance may  result\r\n\r\nwith a declining scrutiny.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me answer this question. Those of us who have\r\n\r\nbeen  involved with this Parliament can bear witness that  there\r\n\r\nis  no  lacking  of legislative scrutiny as far as  the  budget,\r\n\r\nintroduction of policies and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures or programmes that affect our people are\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the three Readings of the Bills in Parliament\r\n\r\nand  the  debates  that accompanied them, our  Select  Committee\r\n\r\nprovides  the mechanism for interested members of the public  or\r\n\r\nthe   affected  parties  to  make  representation.   The  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee   has   been   instrumental  in  clarifying   matters,\r\n\r\ncollecting  feedback,  hearing views and inclusion  of  relevant\r\n\r\nsuggestions  from members of the public, thus further  improving\r\n\r\nsome  of our Bills.  Over and above that, a number of committees\r\n\r\nsuch  as the Public Accounts Committee, which is given power  to\r\n\r\nprobe  and examine every Government department and office budget\r\n\r\nto ensure that money is properly spent, is there.  Every item in\r\n\r\nthe  budget is examined thoroughly by this Committee.   We  have\r\n\r\nalso introduced the Elected President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some critics had lamented the absence of an Upper House\r\n\r\nmechanism  for  the  checks and balances  in  our  parliamentary\r\n\r\nsystem.  Indeed, there was a question on this matter today.   In\r\n\r\nmy  view,  the  creation  of a second  chamber  or  a  bicameral\r\n\r\nparliament  is not the only way in which the legislative  checks\r\n\r\ncan  be achieved.  We have successfully implemented a number  of\r\n\r\nchanges  to  our parliamentary system.  We had strengthened  the\r\n\r\nmulti-racial representation in our Parliament through the  Group\r\n\r\nRepresentation  Constituency  (GRC).   We  had  introduced   the\r\n\r\nNominated   Members  of  Parliament  scheme  in  which   people,\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of  certain bodies of opinions  or  groups,  are\r\n\r\ninvited  to  sit in Parliament so that they can give their  non-partisan   views  on  issues,  Bills,  policies  or   programmes\r\n\r\nintroduced by the Government.  We even have the Non-Constituency\r\n\r\nMember  of Parliament (NCMP) scheme to ensure the voice  of  the\r\n\r\nopposition parties is heard in this Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These indeed are our innovative ways in which we improve\r\n\r\nthe  working  ability of our parliamentary system.  Changes  are\r\n\r\nintroduced;  existing mechanisms are fine-tuned to  achieve  the\r\n\r\nmaximum result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today is a milestone in our experience in\r\n\r\nparliamentary system.  As we move to a new and bigger Chamber - and this debate is symbolic of our desire for continuity and\r\n\r\nchange - we must also do so with a new resolution: to make our\r\n\r\nparliamentary system a beacon of hope and progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, we have succeeded in achieving our objective but we\r\n\r\nmust never rest on our laurels.  We must forever be seeking ways\r\n\r\nand   means  of  sustaining  and  deepening  the  roots  of  our\r\n\r\ndemocratic parliamentary system.  This necessitates the  present\r\n\r\ngeneration and the future generation of Singaporeans to be fully\r\n\r\ncognizant  of  the  strength  and the  potential  found  in  our\r\n\r\nparliamentary system.  They should endeavour to further  develop\r\n\r\nour  representative democratic values that everyone of us  holds\r\n\r\ndear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this desirous end, we need to encourage our\r\n\r\nyoung  people  to  participate in the  nation's  decision-making\r\n\r\nprocess,  strengthen our system of parliamentary  democracy  and\r\n\r\nturn our Parliament as a platform that represents the conscience\r\n\r\nof our citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I am heartened to learn that the new\r\n\r\nParliament  House has the facilities to bring in  our  young  to\r\n\r\ninvolve  in  \"mini\"  parliament debates.  This  would  certainly\r\n\r\nenhance  their knowledge of our parliamentary system and develop\r\n\r\ninterest among our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to the day when our parliamentary system is\r\n\r\nseen  by  our  people, both young and old, as  their  great  and\r\n\r\nhighly cherished institution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  Parliament will be moving to  its  new  premises\r\n\r\ntoday  and  I  am  privileged to be a witness to this  important\r\n\r\nevent,  and  I am somewhat overcome by a multitude of  emotions.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have been a Nominated MP for just two years, deep  in\r\n\r\nmy  heart  I fully realise that Singapore's political  stability\r\n\r\nand prosperity depend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentirely on the sound operation and development of\r\n\r\nour system of parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard the incisive speech by the Prime Minister, my\r\n\r\nconviction   is   further  enhanced.    With   regard   to   the\r\n\r\ncontributions  by the past Members, we have not only  to  record\r\n\r\nour appreciation to them, but also to take them as our model, so\r\n\r\nthat  we can all put in concerted efforts to carry on perfecting\r\n\r\nthe existing system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our parliamentary democracy is derived\r\n\r\nfrom  the British system.  Yet we are able to adapt it  to  suit\r\n\r\nour  multi-racial society and to perform even better.   This  is\r\n\r\nindeed   remarkable.    In  our  various   amendments   to   the\r\n\r\nConstitution, the Government introduced quite a number of highly\r\n\r\ncontroversial  systems such as the GRC, NCMP, Nominated  MP  and\r\n\r\nElected  Presidency.   These have not only  added  life  to  our\r\n\r\npolitical arena but also attracted the interest and esteem  from\r\n\r\nthe  international communities.  However, with the  persistently\r\n\r\npragmatic approach, the Government has been able to explain  all\r\n\r\nthese  issues  to  the  people  through  this  House  and  other\r\n\r\nchannels, and eventually won  the support of this House and  the\r\n\r\npeople  so  that  the  various  systems  or  policies  could  be\r\n\r\nimplemented smoothly and effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, sometimes the people may feel that the\r\n\r\nGovernment is too hasty in pushing through some of its  policies\r\n\r\nand  find  it difficult to accept these policies, or  have  some\r\n\r\ncomplaints over them.  I hope that the Government will also keep\r\n\r\nin mind this saying that \"even the wise are not always free from\r\n\r\nerror\".   In introducing policies affecting the daily  lives  of\r\n\r\nthe people, the Government should listen more to the feedback of\r\n\r\nthe  people, pool the collective wisdom of the masses to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat the new policies or measures may be perfected.  As such,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that after the Second Reading of a Bill in  Parliament,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  in charge should take more time to  consider  the\r\n\r\nviews  presented by MPs before taking the Bill through its Third\r\n\r\nReading.  If this can be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndone, I am sure the people will have more confidence\r\n\r\nin the legislative process of Parliament and in the Government's\r\n\r\nsincerity in wanting to listen to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having gone through the practice and\r\n\r\ndevelopments  all these years, the Parliament of  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nevolved  into  a unique model.  This model is no longer  just  a\r\n\r\nrepresentation of arguments or confrontation between the  ruling\r\n\r\nParty  and the Opposition.  With the establishment of  NCMP  and\r\n\r\nNMP,  no  matter what the outcome of a General Election may  be,\r\n\r\nthere  will  always  be Members from the ruling  Party  and  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  party or parties in this House.  In addition,  there\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  non-partisan  representatives  of  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity,  professionals, trade union movement  and  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations.   This  multi-channel  system  of   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  has instilled in this House a vital new force  and  a\r\n\r\nnew  flavour  of  life.   At the same  time,  it  has  increased\r\n\r\nparticipation  from the people sector of society,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nrelevant non-governmental organisations will be more active  and\r\n\r\nmore  systematic in collecting feedback from the people, thereby\r\n\r\nmaking even greater contributions to our system of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, generally, the people of Singapore are\r\n\r\nmore  willing  to  divulge their personal feelings  on  national\r\n\r\nissues, under the non-partisan circumstances.  These personal or\r\n\r\n\"inner\"  feelings are a reflection of the real feelings  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  As an NMP, I feel that my most important mission is  to\r\n\r\nreflect these real feelings of the people in an objective and an\r\n\r\nunbiased manner to Parliament, to enable the Ministers  to  give\r\n\r\ndetailed explanation or clarification on the relevant issues  or\r\n\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with more Members in this House, the one-hour allocated for Questions for Oral Answers is clearly\r\n\r\ninadequate to deal with the great number of questions raised  by\r\n\r\nthe  Members.  I concur with what Dr Lee Tsao Yuan has said just\r\n\r\nnow.   I suggest that the time for Oral Answers be increased  by\r\n\r\nanother hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, the new Parliament House is not\r\n\r\nonly dignified and stately, but it is also equipped with state-of-the-art communications facilities.  I firmly believe that\r\n\r\nwith the continued efforts and cooperation among all Members of\r\n\r\nthis House and the secretariat, our system of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy will be further developed as we step into the new\r\n\r\nmillennium, to make greater contributions to the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion standing in the name of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nthank you for giving me this opportunity to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to support the motion by the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nLast year I had moved a motion on our founding fathers.  Today's\r\n\r\nmotion is timely and historic.  The Prime Minister has done  the\r\n\r\nHouse proud by moving this motion himself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Second World War changed the history of colonies.\r\n\r\nIndia and other colonies became independent.  In Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nColonial   Government   introduced  elected   members   to   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Council.  But the power remained in the hands of the\r\n\r\nGovernor and his officials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955 the Rendel Commission came into force. For the\r\n\r\nfirst  time,  local Ministers were appointed  with  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernor  still in charge.  Mr David Marshall became  the  first\r\n\r\nChief  Minister.   Later on, we had the constitutional  talk  in\r\n\r\nLondon which led to self-government in 1959.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1959 when the PAP won the election\r\n\r\nunder  self-government, there was talk that there would be  riot\r\n\r\nand  chaos, as PAP was considered extremely left-wing.   It  had\r\n\r\namong its members some communist sympathisers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAP won 43 seats. Opposition had 8 seats in the 1959\r\n\r\nelection.   The  Government had to tackle massive  unemployment.\r\n\r\nHDB  was formed to tackle housing.  Most of the people lived  in\r\n\r\nattap\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouses.  And the Government made rapid progress in\r\n\r\nall areas.  Then came, in 1961, the struggle within the PAP.\r\n\r\nThirteen Members of the Legislative Assembly belonging to the\r\n\r\nPAP walked out and formed Barisan Sosiaslis led by Dr Lee Siew\r\n\r\nChoh and Lim Chin Siong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House used to be packed both in the Chamber as well as\r\n\r\nin  the  public  gallery.  Ghost writers worked  hard  at  their\r\n\r\ntypewriters.  The battle for Merger took centre stage.   Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan Yew went on air to give a series of talks.  He exposed  the\r\n\r\ncommunists  and  their sympathisers.  Then came  referendum  and\r\n\r\nmerger which was short-lived.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1963 General Election was a watershed. Many felt that\r\n\r\nthe  PAP days were numbered as the Barisan had drawn huge crowds\r\n\r\nat  its  rallies.  But the PAP leadership convinced and won  the\r\n\r\nhearts  and minds of the people.  The Barisan Sosiaslis, instead\r\n\r\nof  reviewing its electoral loss, decided to boycott Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed sad.  Had Barisan Sosialis played the role of  a\r\n\r\nconstructive  opposition in Parliament, parliamentary  democracy\r\n\r\nwould have taken a different path.  As a result of this boycott,\r\n\r\nthe  PAP Members had to play the de facto role of an opposition.\r\n\r\nAnd it is to their credit that they had done well.  They used to\r\n\r\nquestion Ministers and they do still question.  Therefore, I  am\r\n\r\na  little surprised at some of the allegations made by  some  of\r\n\r\nthe Opposition Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From independence in 1965 till today, we have achieved\r\n\r\neconomic  progress, social and political stability  because  the\r\n\r\npeople and Government have worked together in unison.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when President Ong paid tribute to the Government, he\r\n\r\nwas not just being polite.  He was stating facts and reaffirming\r\n\r\nthe political culture of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in many countries in Afro-Asia, they\r\n\r\nstarted  building national symbols.  They built huge  parliament\r\n\r\nhouses, many with two Houses (Upper and Lower).  But only  in  a\r\n\r\nfew countries, the Westminster system has survived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDemocracy has survived in Singapore because of the\r\n\r\nmaturity of the electorate and the clean and honest Government\r\n\r\nwe have.  Whether the democratic system will survive in\r\n\r\nSingapore will depend on our people and the political\r\n\r\nleadership.  We must teach the values of the democratic system\r\n\r\nfrom very young to our children both in schools and\r\n\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy that the Prime Minister has moved this\r\n\r\nmotion  and  acknowledged the former MPs for their contribution.\r\n\r\nMany  of these MPs have sacrificed a great deal of time to serve\r\n\r\nthe  country.   They were not adequately paid but they  had  one\r\n\r\nmission,  ie,  to  serve.  And I hope there  will  be  the  same\r\n\r\npassion in our youths to serve the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I congratulate you for your foresight for having a\r\n\r\nmoot  Parliament.  I hope the Members will spare  some  time  to\r\n\r\nteach  the young the practices and procedures of this House,  if\r\n\r\nthey have the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I move to the area which my\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  Dr  Lee  Tsao  Yuan and Mr  Tay  Beng  Chuan,  have\r\n\r\ntouched.   I agree with them that parliamentary time  should  be\r\n\r\nincreased  for  Questions for Oral Answer.  Allow  me,  Sir,  to\r\n\r\noffer some suggestions to improve our parliamentary system.  Our\r\n\r\nparliamentary system and procedure should be changed to suit our\r\n\r\nneeds.   Members  should be encouraged to put in  Questions  for\r\n\r\nWritten Answer and these Questions and Answers could be released\r\n\r\nat  intervals  so that the press and the public  could  gain  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to note the reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the questions asked by the Members do not reach the\r\n\r\nMembers  till  the  House  is in session.   Similarly,  as  most\r\n\r\nMinisters  have their replies in writing which are read  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  it  would  be helpful if the Ministers  could  give  the\r\n\r\nMembers the replies at least one hour before the session starts.\r\n\r\nIn  this  way, Members would be in a position to scrutinise  the\r\n\r\nanswers and they can frame their supplementary questions.   Sir,\r\n\r\nQuestions for Oral Answer session forms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan important part of parliamentary proceedings all\r\n\r\nover the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area is that the public should have direct\r\n\r\nparticipation in our parliamentary democracy.  Like  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  Sir,  we should encourage the public  to  put  their\r\n\r\nproposals  in writing to the Clerk of Parliament who could  then\r\n\r\nsend them to the Minister concerned for his consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that the GPC does play a very important and\r\n\r\nconsultative  role.  But it does not come under the  purview  of\r\n\r\nthis  Parliament.  It is the PAP's own setup.  The  public  must\r\n\r\nfeel that they too can contribute and I am sure the consultative\r\n\r\nprocess  which  the Prime Minister has started  can  be  further\r\n\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our founding fathers have built sound democratic\r\n\r\nprinciples.  I have every confidence that the coming  generation\r\n\r\nwill do their best to enhance parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on a personal note, I would like to thank\r\n\r\nParliament and the Special Select Committee for giving  me  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to be a Member of this House.  It has been  a  rich\r\n\r\nexperience.  To you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am thankful for all your\r\n\r\nguidance and consideration.  The Clerk and his secretariat staff\r\n\r\nhave  been very helpful.  I join my colleague, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan,\r\n\r\nin wishing the nine MPs \"Good Luck\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Mr Mandela, without hesitation said,\r\n\r\nand I paraphrase him, that there is no universal definition of\r\n\r\ndemocracy. The people of each country must decide their own\r\n\r\ndestiny and how they want to shape their own political\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mandela's words are apposite for today's motion.\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  evolved its own form of parliamentary  democracy\r\n\r\nand  we  stand today at the threshold of a new beginning in  the\r\n\r\nnew  Chamber to recognise the contribution of this House to this\r\n\r\nunique development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt when this House first sat in 1965, the Members\r\n\r\nwere imbued with much enthusiasm and anxiety to make Singapore a\r\n\r\nbastion  of  democracy.  Singaporeans  then,  as  they  do  now,\r\n\r\nembraced  the  democratic ideals of the popular vote,  free  and\r\n\r\nfair   elections  and,  above  all,  the  constitutionality   of\r\n\r\ngovernment.  While  we know that democracy must  express  itself\r\n\r\nthrough  the popular vote and fair elections, we too  know  that\r\n\r\nbeyond  these  basic  principles,  we  must  determine  how  our\r\n\r\ndemocracy must necessarily evolve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to differ from the Member for Potong Pasir and\r\n\r\nthe  NCMP  in  what  they said earlier in this  House.  The  two\r\n\r\nMembers  said that we are not a parliamentary democracy  because\r\n\r\nthere  are  not  enough Opposition Members in this  House.   The\r\n\r\nsimple question is:  is it our fault that the Opposition Members\r\n\r\nare  not  elected?  Is it then the responsibility of the  ruling\r\n\r\nparty  to  nurture  the Opposition party?  If the  Member  truly\r\n\r\nthinks  he can represent the interests of the people,  then  let\r\n\r\nhim  take  it  to the people to decide.  If he thinks  that  the\r\n\r\npopularity of the Opposition is rising, then why is it that  his\r\n\r\npercentage  of votes at his constituency is declining  with  the\r\n\r\npassing  years?   The  changing of  electoral  boundaries  is  a\r\n\r\nprerogative of the Government of the day.  In fact, it came from\r\n\r\nwestern democracy.  If the PAP Government was not performing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor if the PAP Government was dishonest and was out\r\n\r\nto cheat the people, then no amount of electoral boundary\r\n\r\nchanging is going to prevent the people from voting the PAP out\r\n\r\nof Parliament.  So, Mr Chiam, do not blame the PAP for the\r\n\r\ndismal and lamentable performance of the Opposition parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, this House has never failed in its duty to\r\n\r\ndevelop  our  political system.  In the manner described  by  Mr\r\n\r\nMandela,  we have evolved our own parliamentary democracy  which\r\n\r\nis  unique and which reflects truly what the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House has, indeed through the years, seen the\r\n\r\nmilestones of constitutional change which strengthened democracy\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. We have ensured minority representation  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber  through  the  GRC  system.  We  have  established   the\r\n\r\nPresidential Council for Minority Rights to ensure that  we  are\r\n\r\nnot faced with the greater evil of the majority trampling on the\r\n\r\nrights  of  the minority. We have guarded against the  potential\r\n\r\nweakness of a dominant one party parliament by providing for the\r\n\r\nNCMPs   and  the  NMPs.   We  have  ensured  that  a  profligate\r\n\r\ngovernment   will  not  squander  the  people's  resources,   by\r\n\r\nsubterfuge or otherwise, by putting in place the institution  of\r\n\r\nthe  Elected  President. Sir, these developments make  Singapore\r\n\r\nunique in the democratic world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time, this House has risen to the occasion to decide\r\n\r\nhow our political system should develop in this country. We have\r\n\r\nnever  failed  in  our duty.  That we are able  to  achieve  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic milestones is largely attributable to the  brave  men\r\n\r\nand  women  of  this  House  who have  never  failed  to  debate\r\n\r\nfearlessly,  whatever their conscience dictated.   We  must  not\r\n\r\nforget  that the challenge was even greater in the early  years.\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a young nation then was lifted from  the  womb  of\r\n\r\nturbulent  and  troubled  times which  saw  the  communists  and\r\n\r\ncommunalists creating mayhem and riots on the streets.  The core\r\n\r\nof  politics  then  was indeed a call to do  battle  with  these\r\n\r\nelements.  All too often, these brave men and women had to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nendure verbal abuse and at times, the threat of\r\n\r\nphysical abuse to do what they thought was right.  For every\r\n\r\nbrave and dedicated Member, Singapore owes them an immense debt\r\n\r\nof gratitude.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my past two years here in this House, I have never had\r\n\r\nthe  occasion to doubt that any of my backbench colleagues  here\r\n\r\nwould  be afraid to ask questions or to seek answers to anything\r\n\r\nwhich  they  thought was not right.  And to the  credit  of  our\r\n\r\nGovernment, they have never failed to provide answers no  matter\r\n\r\nhow  unpleasant the subject matter is, if only because they know\r\n\r\nthey  owe a duty and a responsibility to account to the  people.\r\n\r\nOurs  is truly a system of accountability which all Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust jealously guard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We owe a duty not only to the people of Singapore but also\r\n\r\nto  all  those  brave men and women before us in this  House  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  the fine tradition which began earlier.   As  we\r\n\r\nwalk through the portals of the new Chamber, let us continue  to\r\n\r\ncarry  the  torch  of  honest devotion  and  dedication  to  the\r\n\r\nprotection  and  promotion of the interests  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Member by way of\r\n\r\nclarification of his speech. The Member says he does  not  agree\r\n\r\nwith the Opposition's definition of parliamentary democracy  but\r\n\r\nhe  has  not  given  us  what  his definition  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy is.  Secondly, would he agree that the question  asked\r\n\r\nof  Nelson Mandela, because I asked the question, was not  about\r\n\r\ndemocracy in Singapore but about the democracy that his  country\r\n\r\nwas  practising?  Does he agree there is democracy there and  do\r\n\r\nwe have that here in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> I would take the second question first. I\r\n\r\nthink  the substance of Mr Mandela's answer is essentially  that\r\n\r\ndemocracy is to be defined by each\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry based on its own national circumstance and\r\n\r\nit is not for him to provide a universal definition.  In\r\n\r\nresponse to the first question on the definition of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, I do not think this is the appropriate\r\n\r\noccasion for us to engage in an extensive debate on what\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy is beyond reaffirming what I have stated\r\n\r\nearlier, that the process of parliamentary democracy is\r\n\r\nimportant and that in this country, we must recognise that we\r\n\r\nhave a free and fair election and that the people are given the\r\n\r\nright to choose, and that is important.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the name  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British parliamentary system has been recognised as the\r\n\r\nmodel  for  all democratic countries in the world. As  a  former\r\n\r\nBritish   colony,  Singapore  first  adopted   the   system   of\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly  under the British Westminister  model  in\r\n\r\n1955,  but  democracy was apparently lacking then. In 1959,  the\r\n\r\nPAP won an overwhelming victory at the General Election, winning\r\n\r\n43  out of 51 seats, and   became the ruling party in the  self-governing State of Singapore.  It was then that we began to  see\r\n\r\nsome  form  of  parliamentary democracy. In 1965, when  we  were\r\n\r\nseparated from Malaysia and became an independent republic,  our\r\n\r\nparliamentary system was fully established.  Today in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe  enjoy  racial  harmony and the various ethnic  cultures  are\r\n\r\nallowed to flourish and prosper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the completion of the new Parliament House, we would\r\n\r\nbe  able to accommodate most of the modern-day requirements.  It\r\n\r\nis  much bigger than the present House.  Apart from the spacious\r\n\r\nChamber,  we  have  also many committee rooms  with  the  latest\r\n\r\ncommunications  facilities.  It is  a  dignified,  stately,  yet\r\n\r\npractical  building. Today we will be using the new Chamber  for\r\n\r\nthe  first  time.   It  is  a symbol  of  our  progress  in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  our parliamentary democracy.  It  is  a  moment\r\n\r\nwhich all of us in Singapore should be proud of.  As a Nominated\r\n\r\nMP,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to thank the present parliamentary\r\n\r\nsystem which has enabled me to come into Parliament without\r\n\r\nhaving to contest  a General Election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan and Mr Tay Beng Chuan have\r\n\r\nalready pointed out the contributions made by the Nominated  MPs\r\n\r\nin  this  House.   It  is  my hope that   in  this  House  where\r\n\r\nOpposition Members are clearly lacking, we will continue to have\r\n\r\nNominated MPs  to serve their useful purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is an important\r\n\r\nday in the history of Parliament as we move into the new Chamber\r\n\r\nafter the House suspends its sitting this afternoon.  It is  not\r\n\r\njust  that we are occupying a more spacious and modern building,\r\n\r\nbut  the  significance is that the transformation of  a  rundown\r\n\r\nhawker  centre  into  a  new  Parliament  building  mirrors  the\r\n\r\ntransformation of Singapore from a sleepy colonial outpost to  a\r\n\r\nbustling modern city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I first became a Member of this House in\r\n\r\nDecember  1984.  I remember several major Bills and  debates  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  that  had  changed the landscape  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy in Singapore. These include the Town Councils Act, the\r\n\r\nNominated MP Amendment, the GRC Amendment, the Elected President\r\n\r\nAmendment, and the debate on Ministers' salaries.  In  my  view,\r\n\r\nthese are all improvements on the democracy in Singapore and  we\r\n\r\nare  all better off as a result of their implementation.   I  am\r\n\r\nglad to have contributed to these debates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Parliament building is a simple building but a\r\n\r\nbuilding  with  character, a building rich in history.   Through\r\n\r\nits  portals had passed all the movers and shakers of  Singapore\r\n\r\npolitics.  It was pointed out to me, when I was a young MP, that\r\n\r\na certain room was used when the then Prime Minister Lee met the\r\n\r\nPlen. We even have a piece of Westminister parliament set in one\r\n\r\nof the walls in this building.  It is the Tudor Rose from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndebris of Westminister building that fell to the\r\n\r\nground after the bombing raid in World War II.  It was presented\r\n\r\nto this Chamber upon the establishment of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy, patterned after the Westminister model here.  It is a\r\n\r\nsymbol of the linkage between the Singapore Parliament and the\r\n\r\nUK Parliament.  Hopefully, besides the mace it would also find a\r\n\r\nrightful place in the new building as well.  I also appreciate\r\n\r\nseveral of the art pieces displayed along the building.  I\r\n\r\nparticularly like the various bronze cast human heads by Dora\r\n\r\nGordine.  I hope they too would find their rightful place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move into the new Chamber and enjoy all the new\r\n\r\nfacilities, I would like to remind Members that you, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, have played a pivotal role in the planning, design and  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of the new Parliament building.  I was a member  of\r\n\r\nthe  original team formed in 1990 to carry out the design of the\r\n\r\nnew  Parliament building.  The study team went on several  study\r\n\r\ntours   of   Parliament  buildings  in  several  countries.    I\r\n\r\nparticipated  in  the  1990  visit  to  the  Australian  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament in Canberra and several state parliaments.  It was  a\r\n\r\nworking  tour.  The team visited three cities in five  days.   I\r\n\r\nthink  we  spent more time travelling than anything  else.   The\r\n\r\nother members of the team, also led by yourself, visited several\r\n\r\nEuropean Parliaments to acquaint themselves with the designs and\r\n\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that the first item of business then was to\r\n\r\ndeliberate on the seating arrangement. There are several  models\r\n\r\nin   the   world  -  the  circular  arrangement,  the  horseshoe\r\n\r\narrangement,   the  rectangular  arrangement  or  the   existing\r\n\r\nWestminister   arrangement.   As  Members  are  aware,   seating\r\n\r\narrangements  go  beyond physical arrangements.   It  implies  a\r\n\r\nfundamental  belief  in the nature of parliamentary  proceedings\r\n\r\nand,  that  is  to  say,  whether  politics  in  Parliament   is\r\n\r\nconfrontational or by consensus.  For instance, in the  European\r\n\r\nParliament, the seating is a circular one which tends to  foster\r\n\r\nconsensus building in parliamentary debates.  As the majority of\r\n\r\nMPs  in Parliament since Singapore's independence had been  from\r\n\r\nthe PAP party and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe trend looks likely to continue in the\r\n\r\nforeseeable future, it is arguable that one of the other seating\r\n\r\narrangements I mentioned might be more appropriate for our new\r\n\r\nChamber.  This is so because the Westminster model tends to\r\n\r\nfoster confrontational debates in Parliament.  It is therefore\r\n\r\nof paramount importance that the Cabinet has decided to retain\r\n\r\nthe existing seating arrangement.  It reflects the wisdom of the\r\n\r\ndecision makers and the desire of most MPs to retain the fine\r\n\r\nparliamentary tradition we have established to date.  It also\r\n\r\ndoes not preclude the emergence of stronger opposition\r\n\r\nrepresentation in Parliament.  Whether they will be here or not\r\n\r\nwould depend on how they perform in the elections.  Wise men\r\n\r\nhave also decided not to accept some of the more restrictive\r\n\r\nfeatures recommended on security considerations, such as bullet\r\n\r\nproof windows for the public galleries.  Hence, the close and\r\n\r\nintimate atmosphere of the old Chamber will be retained in the\r\n\r\nnew Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Parliament is a building with a lot of new features\r\n\r\nand  amenities.   However,  it is also  simple  and  functional,\r\n\r\nwithout  the  excesses and opulence found  in  other  Parliament\r\n\r\nbuildings.  For instance, there is no elaborate arrangement  for\r\n\r\nthe  Members  such as individual Member's rooms  or  a  swimming\r\n\r\npool,  as is found in the Australian Parliament building.   This\r\n\r\nis befitting as it reflects the basic philosophy of our founding\r\n\r\nfathers.   I  understand that you, Mr Speaker, Sir,  have  spent\r\n\r\ninnumerable hours in recent weeks to decide on the proper  level\r\n\r\nof  furnishing,  pitching just at the  right  level  of  quality\r\n\r\nwithout  being opulent.  I can see the imprint you have left  in\r\n\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, regardless of how impressive or functional\r\n\r\nis  the  new  Parliament  building,  we  all  recognise  that  a\r\n\r\nParliament does not a building make.  What is important are  the\r\n\r\ndeliberations being conducted in the Chamber and the conduct  of\r\n\r\nMembers  in  such debates.  Therefore, it is of great importance\r\n\r\nthat  the excellent traditions of Parliament be retained.  Here,\r\n\r\nI echo the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwish that present and future Members will continue\r\n\r\nto build on past traditions to ensure that parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy with the unique Singapore characteristics lives on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik\r\n\r\nSidek  bin  Saniff): Mr Speaker, Sir, moving  house  has  always\r\n\r\nbeen,  to me, a time of rediscovery and reflection. Often times,\r\n\r\nwhilst  packing  for the move, I would chance  upon  some  long-forgotten  item  and  the memories that it  has  evoked   -   an\r\n\r\nexperience that many here would have shared before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentous move today of this House has likewise evoked\r\n\r\nmany  precious  memories for me, having spent  almost  23  years\r\n\r\nserving in Parliament.  I remember how the ruling party saw  the\r\n\r\nneed  then  to extend its reach to include those with  differing\r\n\r\nopinions,  so  that a wide spectrum of views was represented  in\r\n\r\nthe process of nation building.  That incidentally was how I   - a  teacher and critic of the educational system then  -   became\r\n\r\ninvolved in politics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister and the Old Guard also saw the need to\r\n\r\ngradually  hand over the reins to a new generation  of  leaders,\r\n\r\nand  they were always on the lookout for fresh talent.   In  the\r\n\r\n1976  elections, there were 11 new candidates including, myself.\r\n\r\nOf  that batch, one is yourself, the Speaker of the House today,\r\n\r\nanother is a Mayor of a CDC and three became Ministers,  one  of\r\n\r\nwhom  is  PM Goh Chok Tong.  I am glad to note that this process\r\n\r\nof  self-renewal  is still on-going today, as evidenced  by  the\r\n\r\nmany  young and promising Ministers and parliamentarians in  our\r\n\r\nranks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a lighter note, I remember there was no opposition back\r\n\r\nthen  and  the  Leader  of the House, Mr  E.W.  Barker,  had  to\r\n\r\nencourage us, the backbenchers, to take on this unpleasant role.\r\n\r\nSome  of  us were even appointed to speak when important  issues\r\n\r\nwere being debated, including what language to use.  It ended up\r\n\r\nwith  three  of us  -  Dr Lau Teik Soon in English, Dr  Ow  Chin\r\n\r\nHock   in   Mandarin   and  myself  in   Malay.    The   younger\r\n\r\nparliamentarians\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertainly have it easier today and, ironically, they\r\n\r\nhave the opposition, NMPs and NCMP to thank for that!  Seriously\r\n\r\nthough, I think they also have an unenviable task, as they now\r\n\r\nhave to compete with the opposition, NMPs and NCMP to put forth\r\n\r\ntheir views.  With the introduction of NCMPs, there is a\r\n\r\npossibility that the ruling party may lose some seats in future\r\n\r\nif the NCMPs did a good job.  However, this is worth it as it\r\n\r\nshows that democracy works.  In the end, democracy should be the\r\n\r\nwinner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when one moves, one does not have to discard\r\n\r\neverything  he had before that.  Likewise, as we make  the  move\r\n\r\ntoday,  let us hold on to that which was good.  One of these  is\r\n\r\nthe multi-racial and multi-religious representation that we have\r\n\r\nin  Parliament  today.   The  recent  conflicts  in  Serbia  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia  serve  to highlight the fragility of  non-homogeneous\r\n\r\nsocieties.   I  am glad that the Government had long  recognised\r\n\r\nthis  and had implemented various measures over the years,  such\r\n\r\nas the GRC concept to ensure adequate minority representation in\r\n\r\nParliament.   The  introduction  of  legislation  such  as   the\r\n\r\nMaintenance of Religious Harmony Act has also helped  to  ensure\r\n\r\npeace in our multi-religious society.  These two Acts alone have\r\n\r\nserved Singapore well, especially the minorities  -  the Indians\r\n\r\nand the Malays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving also foreshadows the resolve to meet new\r\n\r\nchallenges.  There will be many such new challenges in the  next\r\n\r\nmillennium.    Time  magazine  reported  that  some   of   these\r\n\r\nchallenges  are  the  need  for  leadership,  the  use  of   IT,\r\n\r\nglobalisation,  ethnicity, the rise of  fundamentalism  and  the\r\n\r\nenvironment.   Indeed,  as issues become  more  complex,  strong\r\n\r\nleadership  is  crucial  to steer our  nation  into  a  brighter\r\n\r\nfuture.   SM  and PM have set the pace as well as the  style  of\r\n\r\nleadership.   Our  future leaders may require a  combination  of\r\n\r\nboth  or may even need to develop a completely new style to cope\r\n\r\nwith  the changing times.  It is my hope that our move into  the\r\n\r\nnew  complex  will signify both a continuation of what  we  have\r\n\r\ndone  so  well in the past and a new starting point for tackling\r\n\r\nthe challenges ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, regardless of how vigorous the\r\n\r\ndebates may be, let us do so with the primary objective of\r\n\r\nmaking issues clear in our minds first, so that sound decisions\r\n\r\ncan be made for the good of the nation.  Let us continue to\r\n\r\ncarry out our duties and responsibilities faithfully as we move\r\n\r\nforward into the future, bearing the weight of our people's\r\n\r\ntrust with sure and steadfast steps.  A final note - let us\r\n\r\nremember that at the beginning of civilisation, Tribes such as\r\n\r\nthe Incas, Mayas, Aztecs and Greco-Romans were at the forefront\r\n\r\nof progress.  By the 20th century, Joel Kotkin, the author of\r\n\r\nTribes, named the following new set of Tribes that have changed\r\n\r\nthe map of the world, namely, the Jews, British, Japanese,\r\n\r\nChinese and Indians.  Let us therefore strive together with\r\n\r\ncommitment to make the \"Singapore Tribe\" one of the Tribes that\r\n\r\nmakes a difference in the 21st century  -  the next millennium\r\n\r\n-  in the same way that our SM has raised our nation's\r\n\r\ninternational profile and put us on the global map this century.\r\n\r\n<br>4.55 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you for giving me the opportunity to participate in  this\r\n\r\ndebate on the Prime Minister's motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our House and its predecessor, the Legislative Assembly,\r\n\r\nhave  been sitting here for the past 45 years, since  1955.   In\r\n\r\nthis period of nearly half a century, Singapore has evolved from\r\n\r\na  British  colony  to self-government, into  Malaysia,  out  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  as  an independent country.   Socially,  we  have\r\n\r\ndeveloped  from  a  loose, migrant society into  a  tightly-knit\r\n\r\nmulti-racial,   multi-religious   and   multi-lingual   society.\r\n\r\nEconomically,  we  have  developed  from  a  port  dependent  on\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade  to  an  industrialized  economy,  dependent  on\r\n\r\nexports   and  then  further  developed  into  an  open  economy\r\n\r\ncharacterised by services and high technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in our policies have been decided during the\r\n\r\ndebates in this august Chamber before they are implemented.  Our\r\n\r\nParliament has witnessed all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant decision-making on the policies of our\r\n\r\ncountry.  It is an important  source of the history of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Our House has fully demonstrated the decision-making\r\n\r\nprocess of democracy, whether you are a Member of the Government\r\n\r\nparty or a Member of the Opposition party,  in the cut and\r\n\r\nthrust of parliamentary debates.  The beauty is, even after\r\n\r\nheated arguments, we have abided by the decision of the\r\n\r\nmajority.  Unlike parliaments elsewhere, where physical violence\r\n\r\ntakes place regularly, our Members, under the able guidance of\r\n\r\nyou, Mr Speaker, have fully participated in the process and\r\n\r\ndemonstrated the spirit of parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to mention a historical\r\n\r\nincident  which  could  have  changed  the  development  of  our\r\n\r\nhistory.   In 1961, when the Government proposed the  motion  to\r\n\r\nmerge with Malaysia, heated debates took place.  There were many\r\n\r\ndifferent  views.   Led  by  Dr Lee Siew  Choh,  eight  PAP  MPs\r\n\r\nannounced on 14th July that they disagreed with the party policy\r\n\r\nand decided to leave the party.  In the Anson by-election, David\r\n\r\nMarshall  defeated  the PAP candidate.  The  circumstances  then\r\n\r\nwere certainly unfavourable to the PAP.  On 20th July 1961,  the\r\n\r\nthen  Prime  Minister Lee Kuan Yew, moved a motion of confidence\r\n\r\nin  the  House.   The debate started at half  past  two  in  the\r\n\r\nafternoon  and  went  on till 4 o'clock  the following  morning.\r\n\r\nThe  motion  was  won by the PAP Government with  a  very  small\r\n\r\nmargin.  The confidence motion was passed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the House had not passed the confidence motion then, the\r\n\r\nPAP  Government would have to resign and hold another  election.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the history of Singapore would have completely been  re-written.   Although  the history of parliamentary  democracy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore was still very short, it played its effective role  at\r\n\r\nthe  critical  moment  and  resolved a  very  serious  political\r\n\r\ncrisis,  enabling the Government to give full play to its  moral\r\n\r\nauthority and power, thereby bringing Singapore to the track  of\r\n\r\nrapid development and progress. It is because of this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat Singapore has arrived where we are.  This is a\r\n\r\nvery important contribution by parliamentary democracy to the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will soon leave this Chamber to move to the new\r\n\r\nChamber in the modern Parliament House, and continue our  debate\r\n\r\nthere.   In  the  last 45 years, this Chamber has witnessed  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  the  Ministers and the MPs  engaging  in  many\r\n\r\ndebates.    It  has  enabled  the  public  to  have   a   better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of  the process of legislation. We must  recognize\r\n\r\nand  confirm the contributions by MPs in the past, and  we  hope\r\n\r\nthat our present and future  MPs will emulate the spirit of  our\r\n\r\npredecessors   in   this  House  to  carry  out   their   duties\r\n\r\noutstandingly, as  representatives of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Prime Minister's motion.\r\n\r\n<br>5.02 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Senior Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  the only Member here, only one of the 25 elected Assemblymen\r\n\r\nin  this Chamber, when the first Legislative Assembly met in its\r\n\r\nfirst Session in April 1955, 44 years ago.  It may be useful  to\r\n\r\nrecapture, if only partially, the atmosphere of that period.  We\r\n\r\nhad  met  for the first time and the first order of business  of\r\n\r\nthe new elected Chief Minister was to move a Motion of Thanks to\r\n\r\nthe  Queen.   The  Chief Minister, Mr David Marshall,  rose  and\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this House conveys its humble duty and thanks to Her\r\n\r\nMajesty the Queen for her gracious message.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message was:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That I look forward with every confidence to the faithful\r\n\r\ndischarge  of this trust for I am sure that those on  whom  this\r\n\r\nresponsibility  falls will carry it out with foresight,  courage\r\n\r\nand honesty of purpose.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was then sitting in the Opposition leading three other\r\n\r\nAssemblymen out of the 25.  I decided that we would let it pass,\r\n\r\nas a matter of courtesy to Her Majesty the Queen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second order of business was the motion by Mr\r\n\r\nMarshall's number 2,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Lim Yew Hock.  He rose to convey to the\r\n\r\nSecretary of State for the Colonies, Alan Lenox Boyd, an\r\n\r\nexpression of warm appreciation for his message.  That message\r\n\r\nwas a political message.  I decided I would not let it pass.\r\n\r\nAfter it was seconded by Mr M.P.D.

I am afraid I must apologise to the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister for having so inaccurately  summarised  it;\r\n\r\n.Now,  Sir,  I  think  the People's Action Party  is  charitable\r\n\r\nenough  to believe that there are men of stature on the  Benches\r\n\r\nopposite  and we look forward with great anticipation, and  even\r\n\r\nwith  some  amusement,  to the conflicts that  would  inevitably\r\n\r\narise.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned to another Member of the Front bench and said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Only a few days ago an eminent supporter of the Government\r\n\r\nBenches,  who was in Bandoeng, (there was a great conference  in\r\n\r\nthe city of Bandoeng where Afro-Asian leaders gathered in 1955),\r\n\r\nno  doubt exhilarated by the high rarified mountain air in those\r\n\r\nparts, was moved to say that this Constitution was nothing but a\r\n\r\ncloak for colonialism.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is another one of them. They gave me openings. I\r\n\r\ntook  them and rammed through.  The Chief Minister was  not  one\r\n\r\nwho  would  take things lying down.  He stood up  and  tried  to\r\n\r\nexplain his position.  He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We have clearly indicated in our policy which will be\r\n\r\ndebated  in  our motion of thanks to His Excellency's   Address,\r\n\r\nthe  Government is of the view that the present constitution  is\r\n\r\ninadequate, but it is not of the view that it is unworkable  and\r\n\r\nnever has been.  There will be conflicts, Sir, there is no doubt\r\n\r\nabout   it,   but  the  policy,  the  doctrine,  of   collective\r\n\r\nMinisterial  responsibility  will,  I  think,  prevail  in   all\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  [Now he is telling his Ministers and  the  three\r\n\r\nofficials - Chief\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSecretary, Financial Secretary and the Attorney-General, three\r\n\r\nBritish officials], . will make it workable where there is\r\n\r\ngoodwill.  Whatever the conflicts within the ministerial ranks,\r\n\r\nit must be remembered that the people have the majority\r\n\r\nrepresentation in the Council of Ministers [that is, he and his\r\n\r\nMinisters], and the majority decision will prevail.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very different world. There was a nominated Member\r\n\r\nof  Parliament  who was a Scotsman, a banker of  Chartered  Bank\r\n\r\ncalled  Mr  Sutherland.  He represented the  British  commercial\r\n\r\ninterests.  He rose to speak and said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Sir, I had no idea that I should rise so early in the\r\n\r\nHouse, but I now do so because I am delighted to learn from  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) that I only represent\r\n\r\nmyself.  So I think I have every right to say something.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I put him on the defensive right from the word go: we\r\n\r\nrepresent the people outside, he represented himself.   He  then\r\n\r\nquoted his Foreign Secretary, Sir Anthony Eden:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I should like to remind the House of the conditions the\r\n\r\nBritish  Prime Minister (Sir Anthony Eden had become  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister)  when he was Foreign Secretary laid down ...  firstly,\r\n\r\nto suppress terrorism;  secondly, to see that the people were on\r\n\r\nguard against Communist infiltration and aggression; thirdly, to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  sound economy and administration and  to  achieve  a\r\n\r\ndurable accord between races; and fourthly, to provide a  secure\r\n\r\nsystem of defence.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then said:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Speaking as a native of a country that has experienced\r\n\r\nseven  centuries  of  freedom since Magna Carter,  I  thoroughly\r\n\r\nsympathise  with the feelings of the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar,\r\n\r\nbut  I  agree with the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon  Teck,\r\n\r\nwho was a banker and a Member of the Progressive Party) that the\r\n\r\ntime is not yet ripe.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nWe were not ready for independence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it was not possible to predict how, from that\r\n\r\nvery  controlled,  modulated beginning,  this  House  went  into\r\n\r\nrambunctious  tumult, as strikes, go-slows  and  riots  overtook\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Because for several years before  that,  since  the\r\n\r\nDeclaration of Emergency in 1948, all was quiet.  That  election\r\n\r\nperiod  let  off tremendous forces that were at  work,  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunist organisations directed the secret cadres in the  trade\r\n\r\nunions, the Old Boys' Associations and the newspapers to come to\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey generated enormous excitement and political\r\n\r\nagitation.  We were taking our first steps away from direct rule\r\n\r\nby a Governor who presided over a mainly nominated Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncillors to a partially self-governing Singapore.  The Chief\r\n\r\nMinister was supposed to be in charge of the Government but key\r\n\r\nsubjects, like foreign affairs and defence, were controlled by\r\n\r\nLondon and in Singapore, the Chief Secretary, the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary and the Attorney-General were all ex-officio British\r\n\r\nappointed officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-reading Hansard, I was reminded of the light-hearted\r\n\r\nirreverence  of  the proceedings in this House because  we  were\r\n\r\neducated   about  the  underground  forces  at  work   and   how\r\n\r\ncomprehensive   was   the  hold  of  the  communists   on   that\r\n\r\ndissatisfied ground.  We thought it was fun and games.   It  was\r\n\r\nnot.   It is a world that has vanished.  Not quite.  Some  areas\r\n\r\nwhere  communist supporters had been resettled, I notice,  still\r\n\r\nvoted  against  the  Government.  People  do  not  change  their\r\n\r\nloyalties  so easily, in spite of prosperity.  That  period  can\r\n\r\nonly  be partially recaptured by those who were present and  who\r\n\r\nwill refresh their memory with these records.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in those first four years, 1955 to 1959, this House\r\n\r\nprovided  me  with a forum.  It was the days before  television.\r\n\r\nThe  newspapers  were dead set against the PAP because  we  were\r\n\r\nidentified  as  pro-communists or likely to be  stooges  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunists  and therefore a danger and a menace to democracy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   But they could not ignore what took place  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber because they reflected what was going on outside -  Hock\r\n\r\nLee  bus  riots, series of strikes, go-slows which had  erupted.\r\n\r\nBy  the  end of the second year, 1955 to 1957, tumultuous events\r\n\r\ntook  place  outside  this Chamber.  Late in  1956  after  David\r\n\r\nMarshall  had resigned and Lim Yew Hock took over,  Lim  made  a\r\n\r\nterrible mistake of ordering the Singapore Police Force, led  by\r\n\r\nBritish  officers, to clear up stay-in students of Chinese  High\r\n\r\nSchool and Chung Cheng High School.  He never recovered.  He was\r\n\r\nportrayed as having destroyed Chinese language,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation, culture.  We learned some elementary\r\n\r\nlessons on politics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the second year (1957) after a second sweep\r\n\r\nof  pro-communist union workers, after their front line  leaders\r\n\r\nwere  removed, the second front line - when Lim Chin  Siong  was\r\n\r\ntaken  in,  his brother Lim Chin Joo took over - not as  bright,\r\n\r\nnot  as  charismatic,  but he carried  his  brother's  name  and\r\n\r\nregrouped  the  forces.   This time it was  portrayed  as  being\r\n\r\nagainst  the workers.  By the end of 1957, the ground  sentiment\r\n\r\nhad gone solidly against the Government and the other parties in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly that supported the Government, and in  favour  of\r\n\r\nthe  PAP.   The elections in 1959 was ours to lose.  I  made  no\r\n\r\nmistakes  between 1957 and 1959 and we swept to victory  in  the\r\n\r\n1959  elections,  winning 43 out of the 51 seats.   Without  the\r\n\r\nplatform  that  this Chamber provided, the PAP  could  not  have\r\n\r\nbuilt up its support so quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those four years also educated my colleagues and me on the\r\n\r\nrealities  of  the problems we were going to face once  we  took\r\n\r\npower.  Chinese chauvinism exploited by the communists - Chinese\r\n\r\neducation,  language,  culture  -  the  dissatisfaction  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  who  felt  that  they  were  shortchanged.   Tremendous\r\n\r\nhousing  shortage,  unemployment,  lack  of  schools,  lack   of\r\n\r\nopportunities.  It was a toss-up between taking  over  since  it\r\n\r\nwas  ours to lose or letting a bunch of incompetents and corrupt\r\n\r\nMinisters carry on for a second term, while we built up  outside\r\n\r\nand  became stronger, but ran the risk of the whole system - the\r\n\r\ncivil  service, all its institutions - becoming  corrupted.   We\r\n\r\ndecided we had to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next four years, from 1959 to 1963, turned out to be\r\n\r\neven  more momentous.  Several crises played themselves  out  in\r\n\r\nthis House.  The most important was the day we decided to have a\r\n\r\nmotion  of  confidence,  which Ker Sin Tze  had  recounted.   We\r\n\r\nwanted to separate the goats from the sheep.  It is difficult to\r\n\r\ncapture   the  atmosphere  because  today  the  communists   are\r\n\r\nnobodies.   But  at that time, they believed,  and  many  people\r\n\r\nbelieved,  that they were the tide of history.  And  Assemblymen\r\n\r\nhad\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto decide whether you go against that tide of\r\n\r\nhistory and get swept away or you ride the surf.  We took a\r\n\r\nvote.  Thirteen of them decided to ride the surf.  The biggest\r\n\r\nsurf rider of all was Dr Lee Siew Choh.  He was no communist.\r\n\r\nWe had fielded him as a candidate because Dr Goh Keng Swee knew\r\n\r\nhim as a fellow student, he was in medical college, and as a\r\n\r\nchess player and a gambler.  He gambled in his moves.  And we\r\n\r\nsaid, why not, he spoke Chinese.  He was promised by the\r\n\r\nCommunists that he would become the Prime Minister.  And one\r\n\r\ndoctor who was no communist also joined them.  I do not know how\r\n\r\nold Dr Ker was then.  Maybe he remembered reading it in the\r\n\r\nnewspapers or perhaps he looked up Hansard that after the\r\n\r\ndebate, at 4.00 am, after the votes were counted, we were still\r\n\r\nthe Government, and the battle began in earnest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time we had shrugged the albatross off our necks.\r\n\r\nWe  expelled  the  13  pro-communist  PAP  Assemblymen  who  had\r\n\r\nabstained from voting.  They did not vote against us.  They were\r\n\r\nstill hoping that somehow they would find a way to stay in power\r\n\r\nwith  us.   We  expelled  them.  They went  into  opposition  as\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, with Dr Lee Siew Choh as their leader.   Quite\r\n\r\na  few  Members  in  this  House will remember  Dr  Lee  in  his\r\n\r\ninterlude as a Non-Constituency MP from 1988 to 1991.  But  what\r\n\r\nthey  saw was a shadow of Dr Lee, an older, much chastened  man;\r\n\r\nthis  time without the aura and the sense of imminent  power  of\r\n\r\nthe  communists  behind  him.  We saw a man,  who  Members  will\r\n\r\nremember,  found  it  difficult to take himself  seriously.   He\r\n\r\nwould make a statement, then he would giggle at himself, because\r\n\r\nhe  knew  it was ridiculous to say these things.  He  could  not\r\n\r\ntake  himself seriously.  But I remember him in the 1960s  as  a\r\n\r\ndefiant  figure, ranting at the Government Frontbenches, fervent\r\n\r\nin  the  belief that he was destined for greatness as  the  next\r\n\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those in this House who have not experienced those\r\n\r\ntimes,  let  me  say  why  I call this House  something  like  a\r\n\r\ntheatre.   Whenever there is a crisis, the crowd would  fill  up\r\n\r\nthe  Strangers' Gallery.  It happened when there were  riots  in\r\n\r\nJune\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1955 when I was denounced by Mr David Marshall, and\r\n\r\nfrom time to time when there was great disorder outside and the\r\n\r\nGovernment was under pressure.  And, of course, the most\r\n\r\nmomentous was on 21st July 1961 when 13 PAP Assemblymen had\r\n\r\nmoved across.  The opposition, we were not sure how they would\r\n\r\nvote.  And Dr Lee Siew Choh went great guns for seven hours with\r\n\r\na team of script writers inside the Opposition Members' room,\r\n\r\nproviding him with material that he read for the first time.  My\r\n\r\ncolleagues and I rose on points of order, but the Speaker, Sir\r\n\r\nGeorge Oehlers, leaned over backwards, and allowed this\r\n\r\nfilibustering to go on.  I do not know what they hoped to gain\r\n\r\nby that filibuster, perhaps time to win over more PAP\r\n\r\nAssemblymen, then knock out the Government, but they did not\r\n\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an even more memorable occasion when we had\r\n\r\ndebates on the Referendum Bill that they tried to procrastinate.\r\n\r\nBut  by  then, we knew that the dice had been thrown,  and  they\r\n\r\ncould not overthrow us.  Although it was 25-25 across the aisle,\r\n\r\nwe  were never voted out.  I calculated rightly that the  Tengku\r\n\r\nwould  never allow Mr Lim Yew Hock to vote us out and  face  the\r\n\r\nprospect of having to deal with the Barisan Sosialis government.\r\n\r\nSo  we  have  never  sullied our position by taking  in  corrupt\r\n\r\npeople into our ranks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Malaysia, in September 1963, the drama moved away\r\n\r\nfrom  this Chamber.  Because law and order, the police and armed\r\n\r\nforces, were subjects under the central government, so two  race\r\n\r\nriots  in  July  and September 1964 could not be  debated  here.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  centre of gravity returned after 9th August 1965,  Dr\r\n\r\nLee was not in this Chamber, because he had lost his election to\r\n\r\nDr  Toh  Chin  Chye by some 91 votes.  They were critical  votes\r\n\r\nbecause had he been in this Chamber, he would never have allowed\r\n\r\nhis  Barisan MPs to boycott it.  As he was not here, he  decided\r\n\r\non  their  behalf that the 13 of them should boycott Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt  was  a  fateful mistake.  For 16 years from 1965 till  1981,\r\n\r\nwithout  any  Opposition  in this Chamber,  in  four  successive\r\n\r\ngeneral elections that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe won, 1968, 1972, 1976 and 1980.  We reshaped the\r\n\r\npolitical landscape of Singapore.  Crucial was that we never\r\n\r\nabused the trust the people placed on us.  We maintained\r\n\r\nrigorous standards of propriety and honesty.  There was no more\r\n\r\nexciting drama, no crowds in the Strangers' Gallery.  I do not\r\n\r\nmiss an audience when there is none.  I know that that means\r\n\r\nthere is calm, peace, confidence outside.  The only time it was\r\n\r\nfilled up was on ceremonial occasions, like the Opening of\r\n\r\nParliament or, perhaps, today, on the final session of this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they were important years because in the calm, quiet\r\n\r\nand  sober  mood  of  deliberation, we laid the  foundation  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's future.  We consolidated our young nation.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  for a long while yet the House will not attract the  press\r\n\r\nand  the public because they smell blood.  It is when they smell\r\n\r\nblood  -  a government about to be thrown out when it loses  the\r\n\r\nvote - that they would come to watch the kill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when writing my memoirs to recapture those years, I\r\n\r\nscanned  the Addresses made by the Head of State, the  Yang  Di-Pertuan Negara, and, after 1965, the President, to this Chamber.\r\n\r\nThey  were  all  crafted by my colleagues and  me,  and  were  a\r\n\r\nbarometer of our concerns over the 30 years I was in charge from\r\n\r\n1959  to  1990.  They break neatly into three distinct  periods:\r\n\r\n1959  to  1965 where we had a hectic political situation wrecked\r\n\r\nby  spasms  of  violence  and tension and  when  grave  economic\r\n\r\nproblems  were  piling  up,  but not given  full  attention  to,\r\n\r\nbecause Ministers were too distracted.  Then a second period  of\r\n\r\nintense  stress from 1965 to 1971.  Then it was a deep sense  of\r\n\r\nurgency, an urgency that  enveloped us as we knew we had to cope\r\n\r\non our own to build an army to defend ourselves, rushed to build\r\n\r\nan air force before the British withdrew after they announced it\r\n\r\nin  1968  for 1971, that was when it reached crisis proportions.\r\n\r\n1968  to  1971, between the time they announced it and the  time\r\n\r\nthey  withdrew,  those four years were critical  years  for  our\r\n\r\nyoung republic.  We knew we either made it or we would fail.  We\r\n\r\nworked hard, we worked smart, and, most\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant, we worked as a team.  By the time the\r\n\r\nBritish withdrew in October 1971, we had avoided massive\r\n\r\nunemployment which we had feared because some 30,000 civilian\r\n\r\nemployees, about 12% to 15% of the workforce, were discharged\r\n\r\nwith redundancy benefits.  And some 40,000 outside - shopkeepers, bartenders, laundrymen, those maids who serviced\r\n\r\nthe families of the British servicemen - were also affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our defence, I think we were fortunate because,\r\n\r\nalthough  we  had an incipient, a budding little  nucleus  of  a\r\n\r\ndefence  force,  the British, together with the Australians  and\r\n\r\nNew Zealanders, decided after all, because there was a change in\r\n\r\nGovernment  in Britain in 1970 - Labour was out, Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nEdward Heath's Conservative came in - they would stay on, but in\r\n\r\na  reduced capacity.  And that bought us another four years till\r\n\r\n1975.    After  we  rode the oil crisis in 1973,  we  were  more\r\n\r\nconfident  that we could survive on our own.  The  final  period\r\n\r\nfor  me,  1972  to 1990, was a time for qualitative improvements\r\n\r\nacross the board, with our concerns shifting over the years  and\r\n\r\nmoving from fundamentals to the finer qualities of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my speeches in this House mirrored the changes in mood\r\n\r\nand challenge of the time.  As I said, the first two years (1955\r\n\r\nto  1957), it was light-hearted and quite enjoyable, the cut and\r\n\r\nthrust of parliamentary debate with David Marshall providing  me\r\n\r\nwith the sparring partner.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise on a point of order\r\n\r\nto  ask if the Senior Minister has not exceeded the time allowed\r\n\r\nfor speeches.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> He has not exceeded the time.

I lost my\r\n\r\nyouthful innocence.  The seriousness of the threat and the high\r\n\r\nstakes involved brought a more sombre tone to my speeches,\r\n\r\nreflecting my deep concerns for the future.  Politics was a\r\n\r\ndeadly serious business, in which all the parties, all the\r\n\r\nplayers, including us, were playing for keeps.  Make no mistake\r\n\r\nabout this.  In this Chamber, we are playing for keeps.  The\r\n\r\nfuture of Singapore and its three-plus million people is not a\r\n\r\nquestion for light-hearted banter.  We are seeing before our\r\n\r\neyes today what has happened in the last two years in Indonesia\r\n\r\nand what is happening right at this moment in East Timor, and\r\n\r\nyet if you cast your mind back to 1997, all was peaceful.  So\r\n\r\nwhen I hear these speeches about liberties, freedoms, and so on,\r\n\r\nI said that is a luxury we, by our tough, hard-headed policies,\r\n\r\nhave afforded them to talk about.  But for us, nobody would be\r\n\r\nhere today.  Imagine what this place would be like.  So I make\r\n\r\nno apologies either to the people, to my opponents here or to my\r\n\r\ncritics abroad.  Nobody believed we could make it, but we have.\r\n\r\nBut there is no reason to believe that we will continue to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake it. We will continue to make it only if there\r\n\r\nare tough-minded people who know the difference between the\r\n\r\nfroth and the substance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as people in Singapore became better educated, our MPs\r\n\r\nreflected this change.  In 1955, there were four of us.   I  was\r\n\r\nthe only one with a university education.  Goh Chew Chua, an old\r\n\r\nman,  had made his way up in the world as a building contractor.\r\n\r\nLim  Chin  Siong did not finish Chinese high school.  And  Ahmad\r\n\r\nIbrahim, a trade unionist from the Naval Base Labour Union,  did\r\n\r\nnot  complete  standard  six.   In  1959,  43  PAP  Assemblymen,\r\n\r\ncompetent  politically,  were not highly  educated,  grassroots,\r\n\r\ntrade  unionists, two barbers, one farmer, journalists and  many\r\n\r\nnon-graduate  teachers.  With  each  successive  election,   the\r\n\r\neducational  level improved, as it must.  Unless this  House  is\r\n\r\nable  to  reflect the different population that  is  growing  up\r\n\r\noutside, it will not remain relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voters expect their MPs to be better educated, more\r\n\r\nenergetic and effective than they themselves are, and humble and\r\n\r\ngrateful  that they have been voted in once every four  to  five\r\n\r\nyears.   But  that is the way it is.  This trend will  continue.\r\n\r\nIt  means that MPs will have to be more knowledgeable and debate\r\n\r\nissues at a higher intellectual level.  That is happening, and I\r\n\r\nam  proud  to say that I have contributed to this process.   But\r\n\r\nall  said  and  done, each batch of MPs met the needs  of  their\r\n\r\ngeneration  of  voters or the PAP MPs would not  have  been  re-elected the next time round.  Because if you have an MP who does\r\n\r\nnot  tend to his constituents and does not represent them  well,\r\n\r\nthat  is a problem at the next election.  Because they did, they\r\n\r\nenabled the Government to implement tough but sound policies and\r\n\r\ngot  us  to  where  we  now are.  They were  men  and  women  of\r\n\r\nintegrity.  During the 40 years, since 1959, only four MPs  have\r\n\r\nsmudged  this record of clean and honest government,  only  four\r\n\r\nout of over 100 MPs over a space of 40 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the absence of the opposition, we encouraged our\r\n\r\nbackbenchers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto play a critical role; their questioning has\r\n\r\nhelped to ventilate issues which otherwise would not have been\r\n\r\nbrought forward.  The critical period, as I said, for our\r\n\r\nfoundation was three years of intense stress, 1968 to 1971, when\r\n\r\nwe reshaped our industrial relations.  If we carried on the way\r\n\r\nwe did previously with irresponsible unions calling strikes and\r\n\r\ngo-slows, we would have perished.  The union leaders knew that.\r\n\r\nAlthough they made powerful speeches why we should not go so\r\n\r\nfar, nobody, no trade unionist in this House voted against\r\n\r\namendments to the Employment Act, Trade Unions Act and the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Act. They have created the foundation on\r\n\r\nwhich our industrial relations have produced benefits for\r\n\r\nworkers, in their homes, CPF, schools, clinics, hospitals, for\r\n\r\nthe employers in the businesses that they have expanded, and for\r\n\r\nthe Government in their repeated good returns at successive\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no more moments of high drama because the\r\n\r\nGovernment's majority was never at risk.  Even when we lost  one\r\n\r\nseat in Anson to Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam in 1981, the excitement was\r\n\r\nmomentary  because no one expected major change.  Mr  Chiam  See\r\n\r\nTong  created  a bigger wave in Singapore when he won  a  second\r\n\r\ntime  in 1988 with a total of three seats.  It carried long-term\r\n\r\nimplications  if  the trend had continued.   Unfortunately,  for\r\n\r\nhim, he fumbled and he got expelled from his own party.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: will this House see the return of an\r\n\r\nOpposition  that can pose a serious challenge to  the  PAP?   My\r\n\r\nanswer:  that  depends  on whether the  governing  party  allows\r\n\r\nitself  to  go soft and flabby, and ceases to respond creatively\r\n\r\nto  changing  circumstances, and loses  its  standing  with  the\r\n\r\npeople.   This will surely happen if the PAP does not self-renew\r\n\r\nby  attracting some of the brightest and the best of each year's\r\n\r\ncohort  to  become  MPs  and  later  Ministers,  men  and  women\r\n\r\ncommitted to improving the lives of their fellow citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more important is that the PAP must never be foolish\r\n\r\nin refusing, or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfailing to include on its side, able and dedicated\r\n\r\nmen of strong political convictions, whether because of\r\n\r\ndifferences of personality or unwillingness to adjust to PAP\r\n\r\npolicies, and that drives them to the Opposition benches.\r\n\r\nBecause a few sincere and capable leaders could be the spearhead\r\n\r\nof a group of men and women, able in one or two election terms,\r\n\r\nto present the voters with a shadow cabinet, an alternative team\r\n\r\nthat can match the PAP's.  I was able to build up a credible\r\n\r\nteam in one election term, four years after getting elected into\r\n\r\nthis Chamber in 1955, just four years, because I had a group of\r\n\r\ntalented colleagues outside the Chamber to plan and implement\r\n\r\nour strategy and I could present at election time a credible\r\n\r\ngovernment of people with experience in administration and\r\n\r\nbusiness who could be trusted to govern the country.  Apart from\r\n\r\nbarbers, farmers and trade unionists for grassroots support, we\r\n\r\npresented a team with a programme that is still available in\r\n\r\nprint called The Tasks Ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such a turn of events were to happen, where the PAP is\r\n\r\ndisplaced  by a leaner, keener and shrewder team,  I  would  not\r\n\r\nshed  any  tears  over such an ouster.  I would  say  that  they\r\n\r\ndeserved  to be ousted.  For this would be one way to renew  the\r\n\r\npolitical  leadership of Singapore.  What  would  be  cause  for\r\n\r\ndespair, and this is the reason for the Elected Presidency, if a\r\n\r\ntransient mood of disappointment among the people as a result of\r\n\r\nsome  setback or mishap just before an election and it  were  to\r\n\r\nlead  them  to  reject  the PAP and vote in  a  motley  crew  of\r\n\r\nincompetents  and adventurers.  That could end  up  in  tragedy.\r\n\r\nHence  it  is  important  for  us  to  expose  opportunists  and\r\n\r\nincompetents  before they can pass themselves  off  as  possible\r\n\r\nreplacements for the PAP.   There is a reason behind  the  sharp\r\n\r\nreplies  that  we  give.   If  you  allow  someone  who  is   an\r\n\r\nadventurer, who is incompetent, who is a liar, to pass off as  a\r\n\r\ncredible  person, then we are in trouble.  And for that  reason,\r\n\r\nwhen I look at Dr Vasoo there, I feel proud that we have such  a\r\n\r\nMember  because  when Dr Chee came out in the 1992  by-elections\r\n\r\nand I found that he was his subordinate, I asked Vasoo what sort\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nman he was.  He said, \"Well, so-so, not so bad.\"\r\n\r\nBut after Dr Chee's conduct in the elections, he decided, on his\r\n\r\nown, that he would expose the man as a charlatan, a petty liar\r\n\r\nand a thief.  You can imagine the amount of problems we would\r\n\r\nhave once he is elected and allowed to become a Minister.  The\r\n\r\nspin doctors that would be at work that have surrounded\r\n\r\nthemselves around his office.  So there is a serious purpose\r\n\r\nwhich the foreign press of course thinks is dictatorial and\r\n\r\nauthoritarian.  But look at their countries. They do not\r\n\r\ndiscover the character of their leader until after he has gone\r\n\r\ninto office, then they wring their hands.  Is that wise?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament's chamber does not stand unchallenged as a\r\n\r\npulpit  to  get  your views across.  With television,  the  pre-eminence of this Chamber as a forum, has been challenged by many\r\n\r\nother  settings.  It is not just for Singapore.  You will notice\r\n\r\nthat  in Britain, Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, regularly uses\r\n\r\ntelevision    settings   outside   Parliament,    because    his\r\n\r\nparliamentary setting is too raucous, too noisy, too disorderly,\r\n\r\neverybody  wants to catch the eyes of the Speaker to  appear  on\r\n\r\ntelevision, a television opportunity to project themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a reception you gave, Mr Speaker, Sir, a few years ago,\r\n\r\nyou  invited  a  former Speaker of the House of Commons,  George\r\n\r\nThomas  (later  Lord  Tonypandy).  And over  drinks,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and I asked him whether the introduction of television\r\n\r\nwas  a good thing for Parliament. He said it was inevitable  but\r\n\r\nhe  did  not  think  so,  because it had  lowered  standards  of\r\n\r\nbehaviour  in  Parliament and standards of  debate.   They  were\r\n\r\nspeaking  for  a wider audience.  But it has to happen,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave to live with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However Parliament as an arena for the contest of wits and\r\n\r\nwills  over  matters  of policies will always  remain  important\r\n\r\nbecause  of  our  system of parliamentary democracy,  where  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has to command the support of the  majority  in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  not  outside.  He is elected not  by  the  general\r\n\r\nelectorate but by Members of this House, and there is a profound\r\n\r\ndifference.  As a voter outside, you only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow Mr Chiam or Mr Low Thia Khiang from his\r\n\r\nspeeches in print or from the bits you catch of him on\r\n\r\ntelevision or from listening to him at mass rallies. But in this\r\n\r\nHouse, with constant interaction, you get the measure of the\r\n\r\nman, his character, his ability, his integrity, the quickness\r\n\r\nwith which he is able to seize a point or the charm with which\r\n\r\nhe laughs away and says, \"Well, I am not very good in\r\n\r\narithmetic.\"  And for that reason, Mr Chiam got re-elected.  Had\r\n\r\nhe tried to pretend that he was a mathematician, Potong Pasir\r\n\r\nwould have written him off; but Potong Pasir liked the sincerity\r\n\r\nof this man.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this is a better system for choosing a\r\n\r\nleader  because  the selectors have a better  knowledge  of  the\r\n\r\nperson  they  will  support  as  against  those  voting  for   a\r\n\r\npresidential candidate whom they know little about  except  what\r\n\r\nthey  see on television and what the mass media reports  him  to\r\n\r\nhave   said.   Therefore,  Parliamentary  debates  will   remain\r\n\r\nimportant, not just as a forum for the clash of ideas,  but  the\r\n\r\nfrequent  exchanges  that allow Members  to  get  insights  into\r\n\r\nwhether this or that MP will make a good leader and deserves  to\r\n\r\nlead  them in the next elections, because the leader in the next\r\n\r\nelections  will  decide  whether you win  your  seat  easily  or\r\n\r\nwhether you are clinging to the ledge of the cliff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we close our proceedings in this old Chamber, allow\r\n\r\nme, as the oldest Member, a moment of nostalgia.  When I came up\r\n\r\nthe  stairs  today,  probably for the last time,  I  recall  the\r\n\r\ndifferent era when so much depended on how the votes would go at\r\n\r\nthe  division, the temper of the fierce opponents  who  used  to\r\n\r\nfrequent  this Chamber and the Members' Room.  They  all  played\r\n\r\ntheir part in keeping Singapore's parliamentary system alive and\r\n\r\nwell.  I do not just remember the people who are now before  me,\r\n\r\nbut  more  vividly  in  my mind's eyes are  those  who,  by  the\r\n\r\naccident  of  circumstances and the  speeches  they  have  made,\r\n\r\netched  themselves indelibly in my memory. They are ghosts  that\r\n\r\nonly  I see.  But when I go to the Members' Room or what is  now\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers' Room and used to be the Select Committee\r\n\r\nroom, I am reminded of the time in March 1958 when I took a\r\n\r\ncommunist underground leader, the Plen as I call him, into that\r\n\r\nsame room, for our first encounter.  It played a not\r\n\r\ninsignificant part in the history of Singapore, as did many\r\n\r\nother encounters I have had in this Chamber, but none more\r\n\r\nmomentous and more exciting than that one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a message from a pro-communist trade unionist who\r\n\r\nused  to  converse with me in Mandarin to improve  my  Mandarin.\r\n\r\nThis  was  in  1958  and he said, \"Would  I  meet  an  important\r\n\r\nperson?\"   I said, \"Yes.\"  He said, \"It had to be very  secret.\"\r\n\r\nI  said,  \"Why?\"  Because he was wanted and he had  to  be  very\r\n\r\ncareful.  So I thought, \"What if I am caught with him?\"  I said,\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I will meet him if he will meet me at the road between the\r\n\r\nVictoria  Memorial Hall and Empress Place.\"  And we agreed  that\r\n\r\nwe  would meet there at half-past eleven.  He said that the  man\r\n\r\nwould  have  his glasses placed in his shirt pocket.   He  would\r\n\r\nhold  a Chinese newspaper.  I said fine.  He was there.  I said,\r\n\r\n\"Come with me.\" We came up and I took him to the Committee Room.\r\n\r\nThe staff allowed him in because I brought him in. If the police\r\n\r\nwere  to descend on me, I would have said, \"He is a constituent.\r\n\r\nHe  wants to see me.\"  The staff did not know who he was.  So  I\r\n\r\nhad prepared what I thought was a credible defence.  He said, \"I\r\n\r\nam  the leader.\"  I said, \"How do I know?\"  He said, \"You've got\r\n\r\nto  take my word for it.\"  I said, \"Well, if you are the leader,\r\n\r\nthen  you  order  Chan Yuen Tong, who is a Workers'  Party  City\r\n\r\nCouncillor,  to resign.  Then I'll believe you are the  leader.\"\r\n\r\nHe said to me, \"Give me time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six weeks later in April, in London, when I attended a\r\n\r\nconstitutional conference, I opened the Straits  Times,  and  Mr\r\n\r\nChan  Yuen Tong had resigned.  I thought, God, a man, wanted  by\r\n\r\nthe  police,  hiding  somewhere, is  able,  without  messengers,\r\n\r\ntelephones, office, no bells, to get this man to resign.  I  was\r\n\r\ndealing  with a real leader.  We were to meet again three  times\r\n\r\nbefore  the  elections.  They were momentous  meetings,  because\r\n\r\nthey decided how the Communists would act\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagainst the PAP, when it formed the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was privileged to be present at the opening of this\r\n\r\nAssembly  and fortunate to be present today at our last sitting.\r\n\r\nLike  much of Singapore, we have to move out and on.   But  with\r\n\r\nthis change, something is lost, and not just for me.  There is a\r\n\r\nreason  why  the British, and other people with long  histories,\r\n\r\nkeep  a  certain sense of continuity of place.  So people  never\r\n\r\nallow  a  city to be completely demolished and forgotten.   When\r\n\r\nWarsaw  was bombed and destroyed in World War II, first  by  the\r\n\r\nGermans,  and then by the Russians coming back, they laboriously\r\n\r\nrebuilt  Warsaw on their old plans that they dug up,  because  a\r\n\r\npeople must have a certain sense of place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have the privilege of rebuilding around this\r\n\r\nChamber  to  keep  our  sense of place.   The  building  is  not\r\n\r\ncapacious  enough, or sturdy enough, to allow us that privilege.\r\n\r\nRemember,  when the British House of Commons was  bombed  during\r\n\r\nthe  War, they decided to rebuild it in exactly the same  place,\r\n\r\nand  kept  as much of the old as was possible, so that they  can\r\n\r\nsay  there  Lloyd  George,  Gladstone or  Disraeli,  made  their\r\n\r\nmomentous speeches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we became an independent republic in 1965, my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  and  I considered whether we should move  Parliament\r\n\r\ninto  a  more handsome building like the City Hall.  We  decided\r\n\r\nagainst  it.   We  wanted to keep our sense of proportion.   The\r\n\r\nimportance  of this Chamber did not, and does not,  depend  upon\r\n\r\nits  size and its grandeur, but upon the quality of the men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  who occupy it as representatives of the people.  We  must\r\n\r\nhave that sense of proportion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Sidek Saniff saying that perhaps we should be\r\n\r\none  of the memorable tribes that Kotkin wrote about, I say,  if\r\n\r\nonly  that were true.  It is beyond our reach.  But the premises\r\n\r\nwe  are  moving  to  is within our sense of proportion.   It  is\r\n\r\nbetter furnished, more spacious, but not the magnificent and awe\r\n\r\ninspiring edifice that many new nations put up.  By the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandards of other public and private buildings in\r\n\r\nSingapore, it is modest by comparison.  But that is a virtue.\r\n\r\nBehind the understatement lie great strengths of character,\r\n\r\nintegrity and determination.  That is what will see Singapore\r\n\r\nthrough, not the grand statements and monuments in brick and\r\n\r\nmortar or steel and concrete, with which so many other new\r\n\r\nnations try to impress themselves and their followers.\r\n\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, by way of\r\n\r\nclarification, put one question to the Senior Minister?  Will he\r\n\r\ntell  us, within the few minutes left, after he came into power,\r\n\r\nwhy  he jettisoned many of the things that he had stood for when\r\n\r\nhe was in the opposition?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I do not find any profit in this exchange.\r\n\r\nIf  I  had  not  lived  and learned, I would  have  failed,  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  would have failed.

[Applause.]\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your encouragement, I think I will now say more than a\r\n\r\nfew words!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>, this building is the oldest Government\r\n\r\nbuilding in Singapore.  In 1819, when Stamford Raffles landed in\r\n\r\nSingapore, the site of this building was occupied by the\r\n\r\nTemenggong of Singapore and his followers.  Raffles purchased\r\n\r\nthe site from the Temenggong.  But by an administrative\r\n\r\noversight, a permit was issued to J A Maxwell to build a two-storey mansion on the site in 1826.  Maxwell did not occupy the\r\n\r\nbuilding when it was completed but instead rented it to the\r\n\r\nGovernment which bought it back in an auction in 1841.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then used as a court house and subsequently as\r\n\r\npublic offices.  It housed the Supreme Court of the Colony until\r\n\r\n1939, and after World War II, it continued to be used by various\r\n\r\nGovernment departments.  In 1953, extensive works took place  to\r\n\r\ntransform  it into Assembly House which was officially  declared\r\n\r\nopen  by  the Governor, Sir John Nicoll, on 7th July 1954.   The\r\n\r\nLegislative  Council, which hitherto held  its  meeting  at  the\r\n\r\nVictoria  Memorial  Hall,  had its  first  sitting  in  the  new\r\n\r\nAssembly  House  on  20th July 1954.  On 22nd  April  1955,  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly of Singapore held its first meeting here in\r\n\r\nthis Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After independence in 1965, the building was renamed\r\n\r\nParliament  House.  In late 1988, this Chamber was renovated  to\r\n\r\nseat 90 Members in the enlarged Seventh Parliament, and even  as\r\n\r\nrecent  as  two  years ago, with the increase in the  number  of\r\n\r\nNominated Members, minor adjustments had to be made to  increase\r\n\r\nthe seating capacity to its full complement of 93.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 32 seats in the first days of the Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nto 93 seats in the Ninth Parliament, this Chamber has housed the\r\n\r\nlegislature for forty-five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be appropriate for me to say a few words about\r\n\r\nsome   of  the  people  who  have  made  contributions  to   our\r\n\r\nlegislative history and who have served the House for  the  past\r\n\r\nforty-five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House has had five Speakers from 1955 to 1989. They were:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George Oehlers, who served in that position from 22nd April\r\n\r\n1955 to 21st October 1963;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E W Barker, from 22nd October 1963 to 31st October 1964;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A P Rajah, from 2nd November 1964 to 5th August 1966;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P Coomaraswamy, from 17th August 1966 to 18th January 1970;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeoh Ghim Seng, from 27th January 1970 to 8th January 1989.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 12 Deputy Speakers served in that position from\r\n\r\n1955 to 1993.  They were:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R C H Lim, 1955 to 1959;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G Kandasamy, 1959 to 1961;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Mammen, 1961 to 1963;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fong Kim Heng, 1963 to 1965;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P Coomaraswamy, 1966;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeoh Ghim Seng, 1968 to 1970;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang See Chim, 1972 to 1981;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hwang Soo Jin, 1981 to 1985;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tan Soo Khoon (myself), 1985 to 1989;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lim Boon Heng, 1989 to 1991; and Abdullah Tarmugi, 1989 to\r\n\r\n1993, at a time when the House had two Deputy Speakers; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eugene Yap, since 1993.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will, of course, be cognizant of the fact that one\r\n\r\namongst  us,  Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, has that  singularly\r\n\r\nrare  distinction of having served in this House since its first\r\n\r\nsitting day as the Legislative Assembly in 1955.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also want to briefly mention the Clerks who have\r\n\r\nserved  the House.  L W Donough was the Clerk of the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly until 31st March 1956.  He was succeeded by P  R  Lewis\r\n\r\nwho served as Clerk from 1st April 1956 to 5th March 1957.  Loke\r\n\r\nWeng  Chee succeeded him from March 1957 till May 1965.   Abilio\r\n\r\nLopez succeeded Loke Weng Chee and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserved as Clerk until 31st March 1995.  He, in all,\r\n\r\nworked in this building for over forty years.  Another figure\r\n\r\nsome of us will fondly remember was the Sergeant-at-Arms, Sidek\r\n\r\nbin Allang, who served from 22nd March 1972 till his untimely\r\n\r\ndeath on 17th January 1991.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these officers, as well as others, too many for me to\r\n\r\nmention  here  today,  as well as the present  officers  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  will  be  remembered for the part  they  played  in  its\r\n\r\nhistory.   There  are  many  others who  have  made  significant\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  our  legislative history  and  on  behalf  of\r\n\r\nHonourable  Members,  I  want to thank all  of  them  for  their\r\n\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you may not have noticed it, but since the last\r\n\r\nsitting  of  the  House on 18th August 1999, we have  moved  the\r\n\r\nTable  of  the House (made when this Chamber underwent extensive\r\n\r\nrenovations in 1988) to the new Chamber.  In its place  here  is\r\n\r\nthe  original  Table of the House.  It appears fitting  that  at\r\n\r\nthis  final sitting in this Chamber, we bring back the  original\r\n\r\nTable together with the old despatch boxes, which were given  by\r\n\r\nthe New Zealand Government on 16th September 1963.  One may well\r\n\r\nsay that it was on this original Table that the future of modern\r\n\r\nSingapore was laid out.  Those with a tinge of nostalgia will be\r\n\r\npleased  to know that this very Table, which has been  kept  for\r\n\r\nthe  past ten years in the Committee Room will be brought to the\r\n\r\nnew  building  along with several other items.  I, myself,  have\r\n\r\nbeen  moved to retain in the new Chamber the Chair that  I  have\r\n\r\nused  for many years in presiding over our sittings.  It is,  as\r\n\r\nthey say, bringing along something old with something new.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few moments we will close the doors of this Chamber\r\n\r\nfor  the  last  time.  Unaccustomed silence will then  fill  the\r\n\r\nChamber, but this silence might not be for too long if,  as  has\r\n\r\nbeen  reported, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra decides to  use\r\n\r\nthis  place  for chamber music.  Within these four  walls,  many\r\n\r\nspeeches have been made in over four decades, speeches that have\r\n\r\nhelped shape the history of our country and the destinies of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour people.  Across this floor many have crossed\r\n\r\ntheir verbal swords, but wit and humour have also flowed even as\r\n\r\nMembers pressed home their points with force of argument and\r\n\r\npassion.  These four walls have witnessed poignant moments of\r\n\r\nexcitement and drama, of hope and fear, of joy and tears, and of\r\n\r\nlaughter and sadness.  There were the moments to remember, as\r\n\r\nhave been vividly recalled, such as in 1963, when the House had\r\n\r\nto listen to a Member who spoke for a record of 7 hours and 16\r\n\r\nminutes, a feat which mercifully will not be surpassed because\r\n\r\nof the constraints of time on speeches which were adopted by the\r\n\r\nHouse after that.  Or of special sitting days which were called,\r\n\r\nsuch as the one on 20th July 1961, when the Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nmet to debate the Prime Minister's motion of confidence on the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  a debate that did not end till almost 4 am the next\r\n\r\nday.  And again when the time the House had to meet on a\r\n\r\nSaturday and a Sunday (12th to 13th December 1959) in order to\r\n\r\npass the budget on time before the financial year ended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that I reflect the sentiments of hon. Members\r\n\r\nwhen  I  say that it is with some sadness as well as  with  fond\r\n\r\nmemories  that we leave this building that we have all grown  so\r\n\r\nattached to.  Like each and every one of you, I remember vividly\r\n\r\nthe first time I stepped into this chamber as a new MP.  But  we\r\n\r\nare happily looking forward to our new premises.  Some things we\r\n\r\nhave  to leave behind, but we will carry along with us the  many\r\n\r\nparliamentary  traditions  and  practices  that  have  been  and\r\n\r\ncontinue to be the hallmark of this fine institution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank hon. Members for their kind patience and\r\n\r\nindulgence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I will suspend the sitting and invite hon. Members\r\n\r\nand  our  guests to join me downstairs in a simple  ceremony  to\r\n\r\nsymbolise  our move to the new Parliament House.  I will  resume\r\n\r\nthe  Chair at 7.00 pm and look forward to welcoming you  in  our\r\n\r\nnew Chamber.

Honourable Members, I extend to all of\r\n\r\nyou  a  very  warm  welcome  to  the  new  Parliament  House  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was ten years ago that the idea of a new Parliament\r\n\r\nHouse was first discussed.  As I had related to Members earlier,\r\n\r\naccommodation in the Chamber of the old building had reached its\r\n\r\nmaximum   capacity   and   further  expansion   was   physically\r\n\r\nimpossible.   In  1989,  I  announced that  the  old  Parliament\r\n\r\nBuilding,  together  with its annexe as well  as  the  Attorney-General's   Chambers,  would  undergo  major   restoration   and\r\n\r\nrenovations to create a new Parliament complex.  Since then much\r\n\r\nof  what  we had originally thought of has changed and today  we\r\n\r\nhave  built three new blocks and renovated the AG's Chambers  to\r\n\r\ncreate this new Parliament House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An article in the Straits Times of 3rd April 1991 perhaps\r\n\r\nbest  summarises  the  feelings of some  of  us  at  that  time.\r\n\r\nRecalling that some decades ago, many countries had gained their\r\n\r\nindependence and freedom from their colonial masters, the writer\r\n\r\nof  the article stated that at some stage in their post-colonial\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  these  countries  had  found  it  appropriate   to\r\n\r\nconstruct   a   new  Parliament  building  to  symbolise   their\r\n\r\nindependence.  But not Singapore, he wrote.  Instead, it used an\r\n\r\nold  townhouse built in 1826.  Describing the old  building,  he\r\n\r\nwrote, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"For Mr Lee Kuan Yew's government, it seemed a suitable\r\n\r\nsymbol - frugal, unostentatious, powerful but subdued, linked to\r\n\r\nthe  colonial  roots  of Singapore, but in  no  way  assuming  a\r\n\r\ndominating form ...\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>He continued:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Singapore Parliament Chamber is rather cramped. In an\r\n\r\nincreasingly participatory democracy, there is little space  for\r\n\r\nthe  public,  and  the press gallery is restricted.   Television\r\n\r\ncameras  are conspicuously present.  The Speaker's   Chamber  is\r\n\r\nnot generous; the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlibrary is not extensive for its function; individual Members of\r\n\r\nParliament   have  no  space  in  which  they  can  meet   their\r\n\r\nconstituents or the press; they do not have a dining  room;  and\r\n\r\nthe chamber for select committees is inappropriate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea for a new building was therefore motivated by\r\n\r\nsheer  necessity for more working space and the need to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  Parliamentarians well into the future, rather than  by  any\r\n\r\ndesire to have a symbol of grandeur and glory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past ten years, many have contributed to the\r\n\r\nplanning and construction of this new building.  In 1990, I  led\r\n\r\na  study team comprising Mr Lim Boon Heng, Dr John Chen, Dr Wang\r\n\r\nKai Yuen and Mr Chandra Das and architects from the Public Works\r\n\r\nDepartment  to study Parliament buildings in various  countries.\r\n\r\nWe brought back many ideas and sought feedback and further ideas\r\n\r\nfrom our colleagues.  In 1993, a Committee on Parliament Complex\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Project chaired by me, together with  Mr  Wong  Kan\r\n\r\nSeng, Dr Lee Boon Yang and Mr Lim Hng Kiang, and a Parliamentary\r\n\r\nOfficer, Ms Ng Sheau Jiuan, as Secretary, was formed to formally\r\n\r\nliaise  with  the  architects in its planning  and  construction\r\n\r\nstages.   Piling work started in 1994 and construction began  in\r\n\r\n1995.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new building occupies a site area of 2.2 hectares with\r\n\r\na  total  gross floor area (excluding the car parks)  of  19,765\r\n\r\nsquare  metres.   For good measure that stretch of  High  Street\r\n\r\nwhich flanks the eastern side of the building, and which we  had\r\n\r\njust  walked  along,  has been appropriately renamed  Parliament\r\n\r\nPlace.   Our new building has been designed to give it  a  civic\r\n\r\ncharacter  as  a  state  building  with  consideration  of   the\r\n\r\nhistorical  and  architectural significance of  the  surrounding\r\n\r\nbuildings.   It is in fact a blend of the old and new,  as  care\r\n\r\nhas been taken to restore the old AG's Chambers to serve present-day needs, but together with the new blocks, it is without doubt\r\n\r\na  modern  complex.  We have ensured that it will be a  building\r\n\r\nthat will enhance the dignity of Parliament but at the same time\r\n\r\nit is not ostentatious and luxurious.  If it is large, it is not\r\n\r\nbecause  we  want it to be a dominating building but because  we\r\n\r\nneed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore space, perhaps not all of it right away but\r\n\r\ncertainly in the future.  Simplicity in style and practicality\r\n\r\nin its functions have been our guiding principles in determining\r\n\r\nthe final shape of this new Parliament House.  It is a building\r\n\r\nwe want all Singaporeans to be proud of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have no doubt begun to feel the difference\r\n\r\nbetween  this  Chamber and the old one.  For one thing,  we  now\r\n\r\nhave seats for up to 100 Members, with the possibility of adding\r\n\r\nanother  20  in the future.  The galleries are larger  and  will\r\n\r\nhold  more members of the public and the media.  There is a  new\r\n\r\nsound-proof  Education Gallery that will allow  students  to  be\r\n\r\nbriefed  by  their  teachers  while  our  proceedings  are   on.\r\n\r\nTogether   with  the  programme  which  Parliament's   Education\r\n\r\nDepartment  has drawn up for schools, it is our way of  reaching\r\n\r\nout  to  a younger generation.  For those of us who cherish  the\r\n\r\ninstitution  of  parliamentary  democracy,  it  is  our  way  of\r\n\r\nensuring  that future generations inherit our beliefs, practices\r\n\r\nand traditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new Chamber, too, many Members would have noticed\r\n\r\nthat   the   television  cameras  are  less   conspicuous,   but\r\n\r\nnevertheless they are still here, well-hidden behind the  walls.\r\n\r\nElectronic voting has been provided for and in future, divisions\r\n\r\nof  votes  will be over in less than a minute.  It  is  not  too\r\n\r\noften  that  we have a division but if we do have  one,  Members\r\n\r\nwill,  I  am  sure,  appreciate  this  new  time-saving  device.\r\n\r\nComputer terminals have been provided for each seat but  I  must\r\n\r\nadd that Members will not be able to activate these as the House\r\n\r\nhas  not  made a decision to allow the use of computers  in  the\r\n\r\nChamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, this new building is fitted with the latest\r\n\r\ninformation  technology links and computerisation facilities  to\r\n\r\nallow  Members  to  have  access to  information  databases  and\r\n\r\nelectronic   forms   of  communication,   and   to   allow   the\r\n\r\nadministrative   machinery  of  Parliament  to   discharge   its\r\n\r\nfunctions and work more effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some things remain as they are in this new House. We have\r\n\r\nbrought over the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable that was made in 1988 and as I fondly told you\r\n\r\nearlier, I have also brought over my old Chair.  The Mace, which\r\n\r\nwas made in 1959 at the then princely sum of 1,000 English\r\n\r\nguineas, continues to serve us as the symbol of the authority of\r\n\r\nthe Speaker and Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing must not change. Physical improvements alone\r\n\r\ncannot make for a better Parliament.  It is the Members who  are\r\n\r\nthe  life  and  soul of Parliament and they  are  the  ones  who\r\n\r\ndetermine what Parliament will be like.  It is here that we must\r\n\r\ncontinue  to reflect the aspirations of our fellow citizens  and\r\n\r\nre-affirm  the confidence that they have placed in us  as  their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.  We will continue to debate and argue, to probe\r\n\r\nand  query, to criticize and rebut but we must remember  not  to\r\n\r\nabuse  the  powers and privileges that membership in this  House\r\n\r\nconfers  upon  us.   We  must preserve the fine  traditions  and\r\n\r\ndignity of this House, and continue to observe the high standard\r\n\r\nof  decorum  that is expected of us as Parliamentarians.   These\r\n\r\nhave  been  guiding  principles that have been  the  bedrock  of\r\n\r\nlegislative history in Singapore and must continue to be  so  in\r\n\r\nthe years ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members here today have that rare distinction of\r\n\r\nbeing  the first to sit in this new House.  I myself am honoured\r\n\r\nby  the  equally rare opportunity of overseeing the building  of\r\n\r\nthis  new House and presiding over the move from the old to  the\r\n\r\nnew.   Few  Speakers anywhere or anytime can claim  this  unique\r\n\r\nprivilege that you have bestowed on me and I am humbled  by  the\r\n\r\nconfidence that you have placed in me.  I thank each  and  every\r\n\r\none  of  you,  and  the many others, including  the  architects,\r\n\r\nengineers,  interior designers and the staff of Parliament,  who\r\n\r\nhave  contributed towards the realization of this new Parliament\r\n\r\nHouse.  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for\r\n\r\nthis  rather unexpected honour of being the first to resume  the\r\n\r\ndebate here in this new House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the motion standing in the name of the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to focus on the key contribution of our\r\n\r\nfounding fathers and past Members of this House, our unwavering\r\n\r\ncommitment to the principles of meritocracy and multi-racialism.\r\n\r\nIn doing so, I draw on my experience as a young parliamentarian\r\n\r\nand also on my discussions with young Singaporeans.  For young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, the events of the past two years have been a crash\r\n\r\ncourse in politics, governance and economics.  It has had a\r\n\r\nprofound impact on young Singaporeans.  It has vividly imparted\r\n\r\nlessons that no lecture or textbook on politics or economics\r\n\r\ncan.  For many, it caused intense emotional and financial strain\r\n\r\nat the personal and family levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the crisis has also had a salutary effect on our\r\n\r\nyouth.   Singapore youth have acquired a deeper appreciation  of\r\n\r\nthe  need for good governance.  In a recent survey conducted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Feedback  Unit, more than 85% of our youth  felt  that  our\r\n\r\nGovernment's performance in helping Singaporeans affected by the\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis has been good or very good, and more  than  90%\r\n\r\nfelt   that  the  Government-people  relationship  has  remained\r\n\r\nstrong, if not going stronger.  These results are comparable  to\r\n\r\nthose  for  older  Singaporeans  and  indicate  that  our  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  like their elders, appreciate the value  of  good\r\n\r\ngovernment, especially in a crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the crisis has imbued young Singaporeans, in my view,\r\n\r\nwith  the renewed respect for commitment to multi-racialism  and\r\n\r\nmeritocracy.  In the course of the recent convulsions,  we  have\r\n\r\nseen  countries compelled to re-examine their core  beliefs  and\r\n\r\nprinciples  by  both external forces and internal  developments.\r\n\r\nIn  observing these transitions, young Singaporeans have  learnt\r\n\r\none  important lesson.  It requires moral courage and commitment\r\n\r\nto  adopt  and  defend core principles such as  meritocracy  and\r\n\r\nmulti-racialism - even when we know these principles to be self-evident. It is not easy even in the best of times, what more  at\r\n\r\nthe birth of a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, Singapore and Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nindebted to our forefathers and past Members of this House for\r\n\r\nlooking beyond the pressing challenges of a newly independent\r\n\r\ncountry to focus on the key organising principles of our nation,\r\n\r\nfor their steadfast commitment to meritocracy and multi-racialism even during the toughest of times.  They have also put\r\n\r\nin place several institutions and processes to uphold these\r\n\r\nprinciples in practice.  The Public Service Commission selects\r\n\r\nrecruits for the civil service on the basis of merit.  We have\r\n\r\ntransparent criteria for admission into our schools and tertiary\r\n\r\neducation institutions.  The Presidential Council on Minority\r\n\r\nRights and the GRC system emphasise the need to ensure that all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are engaged in the mainstream of our country, and\r\n\r\nthat all their concerns are also addressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, this House has not shied away from open and\r\n\r\nvigorous  debates  when it was felt that these principles  might\r\n\r\nperhaps be compromised.  Neither has the Government shirked  its\r\n\r\nresponsibility to act.  The recent debate on bias in the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket based on gender, ethnicity or age comes to mind.  Another\r\n\r\nwas the vigorous debate on SAP schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the move of this House to its new\r\n\r\npremises,  I  wish  to  place  on  record,  on  behalf  of   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, our deep appreciation of our founding fathers  and\r\n\r\npast   Members'  steadfast  adherence  and  defence   of   these\r\n\r\nfundamental tenets of meritocracy and multi-racialism.   I  also\r\n\r\nhope  that  current and future Members of this  House  would  be\r\n\r\nequally  firm  in  their  commitment  to  these  principles  and\r\n\r\nresolute in its defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  today  is  a  day of historical  importance  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  Parliament.  The old Chamber  which  was  founded  45\r\n\r\nyears  ago  had  been  nurturing parliamentary  democracy  in  a\r\n\r\nconsistent manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament has been functioning with integrity and\r\n\r\nopenness.  It has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndebating the country's laws in depth, providing\r\n\r\npragmatic suggestions and solutions.  It has earned the people's\r\n\r\ntrust, respect and praise.  It must be stressed that the basic\r\n\r\nreason for Parliament to have earned the highest regard of the\r\n\r\npeople is the excellent performance and moral uprightness of the\r\n\r\nfirst generation leaders.  Some of the best leaders of our\r\n\r\ncountry have been Members of this Parliament, especially our\r\n\r\nSenior Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who has been in this House\r\n\r\nsince its early days till today for about 44 years.  This really\r\n\r\nadds dignity to this august Chamber.  The old building was built\r\n\r\nin 1826 with bricks from Malacca and China and Indian chunnam or\r\n\r\nplaster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, Members of the various ethnic groups,\r\n\r\nincluding  Indians,  have  been serving  in  this  Chamber.   It\r\n\r\nreflects  Singapore's present multi-racial society.  Apart  from\r\n\r\nthe  present Indian MPs, 18 other Indians had served as  Members\r\n\r\nof   this  Parliament.   Among  the  former  Indian  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament,  Mr  A  P  Rajah, Mr Punch  Coomaraswamy  served  as\r\n\r\nSpeakers and Mr G. Kandasamy and Mr John Mammen served as Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeakers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us at the new Chamber continue to play\r\n\r\nour part for the development and progress of our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs  (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):  Mr  Speaker  Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you  for allowing me to speak on the motion by the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  I rise in support of the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that, Sir, I could not resist just to mention that\r\n\r\nit  is  indeed  an  honour for us that the session  at  the  old\r\n\r\nParliament  House  ended with the most  senior  speaker  in  our\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister Lee Kuan Yew and that we start the new  Chamber\r\n\r\nwith  the  youngest speaker this evening.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  bears well for multi-racialism that the  first  three\r\n\r\nspeakers in the new Chamber are all from the minority group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, this motion today and the historic move from\r\n\r\nthe old faithful High Street Parliament House to the modest, yet\r\n\r\nhigh-tech, spankingly new Parliament House at North Bridge Road\r\n\r\ngive us an opportunity to remind ourselves and Singaporeans just\r\n\r\nhow far we have come since the embryonic years of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  In the words of our PM, not just the lesson of how\r\n\r\npeople vote at general elections and democracy, but also the\r\n\r\nprogression from hardware to heartware.  But yet 45 years are\r\n\r\nstill \"budding\", in terms of an evolving democracy and, indeed,\r\n\r\nnation building.  Lessons however are plenty, as a guide for us\r\n\r\nand future generations to avoid the dangerous rocks that could\r\n\r\nsink us asunder.  Yes, we have weathered many trials and\r\n\r\ntribulations in the chart of parliamentary democracy.  But the\r\n\r\njourney is never complete.  While we have to continue to keep a\r\n\r\nlookout for the OB markers, let us also not be too keen to see\r\n\r\npebbles for the rocks and reel back with over reaction when\r\n\r\nmeeting future challenges.  Our road ahead in this more open,\r\n\r\nglobal and interdependent world to build on the accomplishments\r\n\r\nof our predecessors requires a firm but passionate hand and\r\n\r\nheart.  This might sound contradictory to some.  But to me, that\r\n\r\nis tomorrow's reality today, that is, a balance between the\r\n\r\nclarion call for the strong-willed, the lion-hearted and the\r\n\r\ncare for the weak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, this motion today is also like a call for a vote of\r\n\r\nconfidence  on  our  parliamentary system  of  democracy.   This\r\n\r\nreminds  me  of the fateful debate in Parliament  on  20th  July\r\n\r\n1961.   It  was then a battle between the PAP non-communist  and\r\n\r\nthe  pro-communist  elements.  In the words of  the  then  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, now our Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, it was a motion,\r\n\r\nas  the Senior Minister said it earlier today, \"to sort out  the\r\n\r\ngoats  from  the  sheep\".   To achieve their  agenda,  the  pro-communists  had  even  consorted  with  their  arch-enemy,   the\r\n\r\nBritish.  That is how complex the situation was.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An American scholar, Prof. Robert Tilman, who had studied\r\n\r\nSouth East Asia for 25 years, once wrote in his book, South East\r\n\r\nAsia and the Enemy Beyond, said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"how geography, history, language and culture had\r\n\r\nall conspired against the countries of ASEAN to make their task\r\n\r\nof nation building and economic development more difficult.\"\r\n\r\nLuckily for us today, we do not have to bring an MP on a\r\n\r\nstretcher by a hospital ambulance to muster a simple majority\r\n\r\nvote for this motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happened in that Parliamentary debate in 1961. Mdm\r\n\r\nSahorah  bte  Ahmat  made  that difference  by  delivering  that\r\n\r\ndeciding  vote  for the non-communist PAP.  For those  who  have\r\n\r\nread  The  Singapore Story: Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew  will  learn\r\n\r\nthat   even   securing  her  vote  was  like   a   parliamentary\r\n\r\ncliffhanger.  Mdm Sahorah was holding back her vote, not because\r\n\r\nshe  liked  the  pro-communists, nor was she a communalist,  but\r\n\r\nrather  because her other Malay colleagues were ostracising  her\r\n\r\nand thus she refused to give them her support.  So we can see it\r\n\r\nwas  not just ideology and race but also human feelings, if  not\r\n\r\nego,  coming  into play in deciding the fate of our  efforts  at\r\n\r\nestablishing   parliamentary  democracy.    But   common   sense\r\n\r\nprevailed and thanks to former MP, Mr Chan Chee Seng's power  of\r\n\r\npersuasion,  Mdm Sahorah voted for the motion and  history  took\r\n\r\nits  course to bring us to where we are today for prosperity and\r\n\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the swamps of Jurong to a world-class model industrial\r\n\r\nestate,  to  a  wealth  we can bank on in Shenton  Way,  to  the\r\n\r\nfuturistic  Marina Bay hotels, Millenia Walk  and  Suntec  City,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has shown what can be done when we have a stable  and\r\n\r\nworkable parliamentary democracy.  This is especially true  when\r\n\r\nthe Government and the people can work together in harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our parliamentary democracy to continue to work, social\r\n\r\ncohesion is critical.  We cannot take it for granted.  Singapore\r\n\r\nParliament  recognises this and this is evident in the  Acts  it\r\n\r\nhas  passed  to  enhance  racial harmony  and  social  cohesion.\r\n\r\nWhether  the  establishment  of  the  Presidential  Council  for\r\n\r\nMinority Rights, Islamic Religious Council (MUIS),\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Hindu Endowments Board, the Maintenance of\r\n\r\nReligious Harmony Act and the GRC, it shows a Singapore well\r\n\r\ngrounded for racial and religious harmony.  But even then, we\r\n\r\ncannot take that for granted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to enhance the parliamentary democracy we\r\n\r\nnow  enjoy,  may I propose two points.  One, we need  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  multi-racialism  continues to  be  a  critical  pillar  to\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy.  We must also continue to be  bold  and\r\n\r\ncreative to strengthen that position.  The more pillars we  have\r\n\r\nto  strengthen  the  base  for democracy,  the  better  we  are.\r\n\r\nInstitutions which we now have for nation building and community\r\n\r\nupliftment  and  which  have  been a  source  of  irritation  or\r\n\r\ncontroversy  among  some quarters, for example,  the  community-based  self-help  groups and the SAP schools, will  have  to  be\r\n\r\ncontinually monitored to provide more opportunities for cohesive\r\n\r\nand  harmonious  relations.   Similarly,  the  present  creative\r\n\r\nparliamentary democratic institutions unique to Singapore,  such\r\n\r\nas  the  GRC  and the Presidential Council for Minority  Rights,\r\n\r\nneed   to   be  periodically  reviewed  and  refined,   whenever\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, more opportunities should be created for Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially the younger and succeeding generations, to appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  trials and tribulations of our efforts at establishing  and\r\n\r\nenhancing parliamentary democracy.  Our school's effort at civic\r\n\r\neducation and understanding Singapore's post-war history  should\r\n\r\ninclude such highlights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I conclude by saying that we at\r\n\r\nPunggol  East,  Cheng  San GRC, have a slogan  which  emphasises\r\n\r\nprogress  in harmony.  That, to me, sums up the case  in  point.\r\n\r\nFor  democracy is nothing without progress in harmony.   In  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of that important pillar of our parliamentary democracy,\r\n\r\nmulti-racialism, allow me to close my comment by repeating  that\r\n\r\nslogan  in  three languages: majulah dalam harmoni, inakkathudan\r\n\r\nmunneru and he xie qian jin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion in the name of the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nchallenges confronting Members of this House have been vastly\r\n\r\ndifferent in each of the last four decades.  We went from\r\n\r\ncreating an economy virtually from scratch to building it to\r\n\r\nwhat it is today, a well diversified composition of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and services.  We achieved this in spite of our\r\n\r\nlack of natural resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we started off then by catering to a migrant\r\n\r\npopulation of different races and cultures with different needs,\r\n\r\nleanings  and  aspirations.   We now  have  a  population  whose\r\n\r\ncohesion  as  a  people has been manifestly evident  during  the\r\n\r\ncurrent downturn.  We enjoy racial harmony and high standards of\r\n\r\nliving, something which we know did not happen by chance, and we\r\n\r\nhave  achieved this in spite of our short history as  a  nation.\r\n\r\nThe  common thread running through the decades can be  found  in\r\n\r\nthe  confidence the electorate has in the integrity and openness\r\n\r\nof  our  parliamentary  system.  This  has  been  fulfilled  and\r\n\r\nestablished by the unequivocal commitment of past Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will continue to sail in uncharted seas. But the\r\n\r\nkey is to mark out the reefs and rocks and to avoid them as best\r\n\r\nas we can.  The challenges will continue to be different even as\r\n\r\nwe  strive  to  build a first world economy in an  era  that  is\r\n\r\nmarked  by  intensifying  competition  and  borderless  business\r\n\r\ndynamics.   Singaporeans will increasingly  cater  to  a  global\r\n\r\neconomy  and  be  forced  to  adopt  the  necessary  skills  and\r\n\r\nperspectives.  Demands on the family unit will be ever  present.\r\n\r\nWhilst we can never be sure how challenges will be shaped in the\r\n\r\nfuture, we can be certain of our responsibilities as Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House as the same qualities and attributes are required  of\r\n\r\nus.   Our  responsibility  is to guard against  complacency,  to\r\n\r\nembrace  a  willingness  and  the  moral  courage  to  make  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  changes  and,  most  importantly,  to  preserve   the\r\n\r\nintegrity of this House in order to maintain at least  the  same\r\n\r\nlevel  of  confidence.   Only  then  can  we  move  ahead   with\r\n\r\nconviction and commitment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, whilst I may be short on experience in this\r\n\r\nHouse, I intend to be long on my sense of duty and\r\n\r\nresponsibility to the people of Singapore.  On that wish, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you\r\n\r\nfor  allowing me to join in the debate. It is indeed interesting\r\n\r\nto  speak after the younger speakers because they could urge  me\r\n\r\non and, at the same time, we could provide an anchor for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as SM Lee was speaking, my mind went back when I was a\r\n\r\nsecondary  school  student in the 50s.   I  did  not  know  what\r\n\r\ndemocracy  was  then.  All I knew was the common rhetorics  that\r\n\r\nhave  been  said by some of these Opposition Members,  rhetorics\r\n\r\nabout  good  life, democracy and various other things.   What  I\r\n\r\nremember was that I was looking forward for the supply of  piped\r\n\r\nwater and electricity to my village and proper shelter.  But  it\r\n\r\ndid  not come as there was an inefficient and corrupt government\r\n\r\nunder Lim Yew Hock.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our villagers voted for change in 1959 and supported the\r\n\r\nPAP  government.  They hoped for better social  conditions.   In\r\n\r\nthe  late  60s,  people in my village saw the arrival  of  piped\r\n\r\nwater  and  electricity  and  some improvements  in  the  social\r\n\r\nconditions of the village. That was Nee Soon where I lived as  a\r\n\r\nyoung secondary school student.  The village comprised a lot  of\r\n\r\ncorrupt  officials, corrupt middle community  leaders  and  they\r\n\r\nsupported all the corrupt practices of the government then.   It\r\n\r\nwas a change for me and my villagers after 1959.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that people in my village were very discerning.\r\n\r\nThey  were  very  sharp  and  could see  what  good  and  honest\r\n\r\ngovernment  was  then, and they attributed the improvements  and\r\n\r\nthe change to honest government and capable leadership.  I could\r\n\r\nvividly  remember this as a young person then,  because  all  of\r\n\r\nthem were looking for better life, for change, and I recall many\r\n\r\nof them saying that we could not just go on with democracy on an\r\n\r\nempty  stomach.   All  the  sayings  under  the  Lim  Yew   Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment did not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproduce any results. We hoped that the PAP\r\n\r\ngovernment would bring progress and good life for all of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the capable leadership of SM Lee, then the PM, the\r\n\r\nvillage  transformed.   People can see through  if  we  have  an\r\n\r\nhonest  government and they have voted election  after  election\r\n\r\nfor  an  honest  government and capable  leaders.   Sir,  honest\r\n\r\ngovernment and capable leadership is a good premium which we now\r\n\r\nalso  enjoy  the  leadership of PM Goh. So I  hope  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwould  be  mindful  to  vote honest and  effective  people  into\r\n\r\ngovernment  in  the  future  so that  the  social  premium  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  pay dividends to enhance the quality  of  life  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one major challenge we are likely to face in future is\r\n\r\nthe  task of tackling the dangers of social divide between those\r\n\r\nwho have and those who have a little.  It is important for us to\r\n\r\nencourage those who are able, to assist those who are less able.\r\n\r\nThe   able  cannot  isolate  themselves  and  have  a  parochial\r\n\r\ninterest, for if they do, they will not enhance social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that we would be able to nurture many good\r\n\r\npeople  and attract them into Parliament and the various  social\r\n\r\ninstitutions  to  carry out the very good work of  our  founding\r\n\r\nfathers, including mothers, who have contributed to the  healthy\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that call, I support the motion of PM Goh.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I clarify with the Member who has just\r\n\r\nspoken?   He  mentioned about the rhetoric calls  for  democracy\r\n\r\nmade in the 50s.

Parliament had just sat for the very last  time  in\r\n\r\nthe  old  Chamber before it moved here to its new  home  a  very\r\n\r\nshort  while  ago.  It has much to be proud of during  its  stay\r\n\r\nthere  since  22nd April 1955.  Much has been achieved  in  that\r\n\r\naugust Chamber.  As a country and a people, we have much  to  be\r\n\r\ngrateful  for.  Its occupants have risen to the many  challenges\r\n\r\nand their decisions had led to the impressive development of our\r\n\r\nnation  and the good living that we, its citizens, enjoy  today.\r\n\r\nWe must continue with the good work here in this new Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our parliamentary system is based on the Westminster model\r\n\r\nas  with other Commonwealth countries.  However, over time, each\r\n\r\nParliament  has  evolved  in its own  way  in  response  to  the\r\n\r\ncharacteristics and needs of the country and its people.  We  do\r\n\r\nlikewise.   The major factors that dictate our actions  are  the\r\n\r\nshort  history  of our country, our small size  and  the  multi-racial,  multi-cultural  and  multi-religious  aspects  of   our\r\n\r\nsociety.  These  are some constraints that we  have  to  manage.\r\n\r\nMany  countries with such constraints have found  out  at  great\r\n\r\ncost   how   potent  they  can  be  if  not  handled  carefully,\r\n\r\nsensitively  and appropriately.  We have therefore evolved,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  Group Representation Constituency (GRC)  to  take\r\n\r\ncare  of  the  multi-racial nature of our society and  the  Non-Constituency MP and the Nominated MP to allow for a wider  range\r\n\r\nof views to be reflected in its debates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, unfortunately, not everyone, especially\r\n\r\ncritics in the developed countries, understands, appreciates,\r\n\r\nagrees or is convinced of what we have done or our objectives\r\n\r\nfor doing so.  They would prefer our institutions and systems to\r\n\r\nbe like theirs.  But we cannot do what they wish.  At the end of\r\n\r\nthe day, we must decide for ourselves and do things the way that\r\n\r\nfits our circumstances and meets our needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things that the larger and older nations have, we may\r\n\r\neventually also have.  But we would have them in good  time  and\r\n\r\nat  our pace if these are good for us and we, as a society,  are\r\n\r\nready  for  them. We must not allow ourselves to be  pressed  to\r\n\r\nchange,  to conform or to be misled into believing that we  must\r\n\r\nhave  them. As a society, we must decide for ourselves  what  is\r\n\r\ngood for us and to stand firm in the belief that we are the best\r\n\r\njudges of this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of Parliament is to help manage the country for\r\n\r\nthe  good  of  its people.  Its Members represent the  citizens.\r\n\r\nThe  success  of the Members of Parliament is a collective  one,\r\n\r\nreflected in the development and growth of the country, the well-being  of  its people and the respect that the people accord  to\r\n\r\nParliament   as   an   institution  and   the   MPs   as   their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.  If this is the criterion, then  I  believe  we\r\n\r\nhave  done well.  I am therefore happy and proud that our people\r\n\r\nunderstand and appreciate what Parliament has achieved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be in Parliament is a serious matter. The development\r\n\r\nof  a  nation  and the well-being of the people  depend  on  its\r\n\r\ndeliberation and decisions.  Members of Parliament see it  as  a\r\n\r\nforum  to  input  their  knowledge,  skills  and  experience  to\r\n\r\nrationally and effectively debate the issues of the nation so as\r\n\r\nto  arrive  at  decisions that are in the best interest  of  the\r\n\r\nnation  and  the  people.   As  a  result,  the  proceedings  in\r\n\r\nParliament are carried out efficiently and effectively with  the\r\n\r\nearnest  and  decorum that the august Chamber deserves  and  the\r\n\r\npeople expect of the representatives.  This must continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a young country. Singapore will face\r\n\r\nyet many new and demanding challenges.  As Singapore evolves, so\r\n\r\nhas Parliament to do likewise.  We must seek not only to\r\n\r\nmaintain the progress and good work done and the high standards\r\n\r\nset by those before us, but wherever and whenever possible, to\r\n\r\nimprove them further. We have to ensure that we remain relevant\r\n\r\nand useful to the lives and needs of our nation and our people\r\n\r\nthat the decorum and respect of Parliament is maintained.  We\r\n\r\nmust bravely do what we believe is good for our country and our\r\n\r\npeople.  This is a demanding responsibility that we, as\r\n\r\nparliamentarians, must persevere to fulfil, never let go off or\r\n\r\nforget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I look around this\r\n\r\nnew  Chamber, it reminds me very much of the old. The layout  is\r\n\r\nthe  same, the furnishing is just as modest and even the  colour\r\n\r\nof  the seat cover is the same dark maroon.  I only wish my seat\r\n\r\nwas as deep as the one in the old Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Chamber, however, is more spacious. It should serve\r\n\r\nour  needs for at least another 100 years, if not forever.   The\r\n\r\nseating layout can even be re-configured into a horseshoe  shape\r\n\r\nor circular shape if some future Parliament chooses to do so. We\r\n\r\ncan now also vote electronically.  But just as a house is not  a\r\n\r\nhome, a new Parliament building alone does not guarantee a  good\r\n\r\nParliament. Whether this Parliament building becomes a respected\r\n\r\nhome for parliamentary democracy will depend on the present  and\r\n\r\nfuture  Members of this House.  We must therefore continue  with\r\n\r\nthe  tradition  of  the  old Chamber,  upholding  standards  and\r\n\r\nworking for the benefit of the people whom we represent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Members who have spoken in support of the motion. I\r\n\r\nwant to thank Senior Minister in particular.  He has recalled  a\r\n\r\nbit  of  history  with  his speech and  added  meaning  to  this\r\n\r\nnostalgic occasion. I do not intend to respond to every  comment\r\n\r\nmade by those who spoke.  It is not necessary and time does  not\r\n\r\npermit me to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan said that there is an excess\r\n\r\ndemand for political participation and policy consultation in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I disagree.  Yes, many people want to have their\r\n\r\nviews and comments heard or seen in print but they also want to\r\n\r\nhave the safety of staying out of the political arena plus the\r\n\r\nluxury of being able to carp or shoot from the hip without\r\n\r\nattracting Government counterfire.  Meaningful political\r\n\r\nparticipation must mean joining or supporting a political party,\r\n\r\nadvancing its cause and work, attending to constituents and if\r\n\r\ninvited, take part in elections, win and serve as an MP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many upcoming successful Singaporeans want to sacrifice\r\n\r\ntheir   careers,  privacy  and  time  with  their  families   to\r\n\r\nparticipate actively in politics?  I invite Dr Lee  to  find  me\r\n\r\nfive  suitable women candidates for the next general  elections.\r\n\r\nShe has two or three years to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam and Mr Jeyaretnam, as we must expect, will always\r\n\r\ntake the opposite view.  They must not blame the Government,  or\r\n\r\nblame  us, for their own failure to increase the number of seats\r\n\r\nfor Opposition Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam has fought five general and three by-elections since 1972. He lost six times, won only twice. He\r\n\r\nmay  criticise us for impeding parliamentary democracy, but  the\r\n\r\ntruth  is  that the people have rejected him, the last  time  in\r\n\r\nCheng San.  He owes his presence here today to the pragmatism of\r\n\r\nSingapore's parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

MPs will come under pressure from the public\r\n\r\nwhenever tough, painful policies and measures are introduced.\r\n\r\nOur job is to lead, to explain, to persuade.  This is not to say\r\n\r\nthat we ignore public sentiments.  They are important.  We must\r\n\r\nunderstand them, be sensitive and responsive.  Wherever\r\n\r\npossible, we must consult people  -  people who can contribute\r\n\r\nto the formulation of public policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultation does not mean taking a straw poll and\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  majority view.  Our response must  be  based  on\r\n\r\nlonger-term national interest, even if it means short-term pain,\r\n\r\nand  on  larger  collective  interests  rather  than  individual\r\n\r\ninterests.   We  must explain our policies and  persuade  people\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  right.  This is the meaning of leadership,  and\r\n\r\nthis is the key role of MPs, as the people's representatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new building, our eyes must be cast on the future\r\n\r\nrather than on the past.  What new challenges will confront  us?\r\n\r\nCan  we  overcome  them?  Expectations of a  new  generation  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   -   can  we meet them?  Will  future  generations\r\n\r\nthrow  up  strong and able leaders to protect, defend  and  lead\r\n\r\nSingapore to more good years?  This and future Parliaments  will\r\n\r\nhave to find the answers to these questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we continue to increase the quality of representation in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  we  will maximise our chances of perpetuating  the\r\n\r\nvirtuous  cycle  we  have created, good  MPs,  strong  and  good\r\n\r\nGovernment, political stability, sustained economic growth, good\r\n\r\nliving  environment  and  comfortable  homes,  a  cohesive   and\r\n\r\nsupportive people, committed leaders, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament has played a key role in the development of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In time to come, this new Parliament House will have\r\n\r\nits own history to tell and its own memories to recall.
