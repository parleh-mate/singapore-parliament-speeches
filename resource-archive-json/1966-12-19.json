This is twice the strength\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nof  what it was four months ago and is equivalent  to\r\n\r\none-half of the strength of the present work force in\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Cleansing  Department  of  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nshould they go on strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to add, Sir, that strike or no strike, I\r\n\r\nshall  personally  take charge of  the  complete  re-organisation  of  the public cleansing  service  with\r\n\r\neffect  from the 3rd of January, 1967, which is  only\r\n\r\ntwo  weeks ahead. Re-organisation will proceed  along\r\n\r\nthe following principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, our public cleansing service will\r\n\r\nhenceforth  be  on  a two-shift basis  and  this  has\r\n\r\ntwofold   advantages.  One,  productivity   will   be\r\n\r\npractically  doubled because the same  equipment  and\r\n\r\nvehicles  could  be used to clear twice  the  present\r\n\r\noutput  of refuse daily. Two, we can double our  work\r\n\r\nforce   if   necessary  and  thus  provide  excellent\r\n\r\nemployment  opportunities  for  our  large  pool   of\r\n\r\nunemployed citizens now numbering about 70,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it will put a stop to the nonsensical\r\n\r\nsystem  of cleansing workers turning up for  work  on\r\n\r\nSundays for double pay and public holidays for triple\r\n\r\npay  as  of right and absenting themselves on Mondays\r\n\r\nand  days following public holidays! This racket  has\r\n\r\nunfortunately gone on for too long even since 1960  -\r\n\r\nfor  six  long  years! We must put  an  end  to  this\r\n\r\nhistorical   farce!  Hereafter,  Sunday  and   public\r\n\r\nholiday work, if any, will be at the request  of  the\r\n\r\nemployer,  which  is  and  has  been  the  prevailing\r\n\r\nsituation in Singapore for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, since the re-organisation is to take\r\n\r\neffect,  strike  or no strike, as from  3rd  January,\r\n\r\n1967,  I  am  now  in the position to  offer  to  all\r\n\r\nmembers of our Emergency Cleansing Corps prospects of\r\n\r\npermanent  employment in 1967 subject, of course,  to\r\n\r\ncompletion  of three months' satisfactory service  in\r\n\r\nthe Emergency Cleansing Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Can the Minister\r\n\r\nassure  this  House  that during the  period  of  the\r\n\r\nstrike,  the  Government will not  use  blacklegs  to\r\n\r\nbreak it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I can give the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  this  assurance  that we  shall  step  up  the\r\n\r\nstrength  of the Emergency Cleansing Corps  from  the\r\n\r\npresent 1,325 to as much as is needed to carry out an\r\n\r\nessential service for the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FIRE BRIGADE POLICY ON ERECTION OF TARPAULIN</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SHEDS FOR PARTIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nand  Social  Affairs what is the policy of  the  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade  Authorities in regard  to  permits  for  the\r\n\r\nerection  of tarpaulin sheds to shelter the  audience\r\n\r\nat a Chinese \"wayang\", a dinner party, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade authorities have no objection to the  use  of\r\n\r\ntarpaulin   sheds  for  parties  and   other   social\r\n\r\nfunctions  generally.

If  it  has\r\n\r\nadequate  funds,  it will probably  acquire  its  own\r\n\r\nseparate  premises. But if it is a poor  association,\r\n\r\nthen  it  may  probably have to share  premises  with\r\n\r\nanother sports association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not uncommon, Sir, to see two or three sports\r\n\r\nassociations  occupying one  premises.  In  the  case\r\n\r\nmentioned  by the Member for Changi, the  sharing  of\r\n\r\none   premises   by  the  three  sports  associations\r\n\r\nconcerned would appear to be a convenient arrangement\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been adopted to their mutual  benefit.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that they are being managed by one and the\r\n\r\nsame official.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The function of the Sports Department, besides\r\n\r\norganising  and  promoting sports activities,  is  to\r\n\r\nhelp,  advise and co-ordinate the activities  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  sports  associations not  only  in  national\r\n\r\nsports   events  but  also  in  international  sports\r\n\r\ncompetitions.  It will also give guidance  to  sports\r\n\r\nassociations in planning central training  either  by\r\n\r\nhelping  to  arrange for the services of  instructors\r\n\r\nand coaches, or by granting monetary assistance where\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also the Singapore Sports Council, which is\r\n\r\nan  advisory body set up under the Ministry of Social\r\n\r\nAffairs,  consisting  of  representatives  from   the\r\n\r\nvarious  sports associations and officials  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  including those of the Sports  Department.\r\n\r\nThe main function of the Singapore Sports Council  is\r\n\r\nto organise the Pesta Sukan and to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvise  the  Minister  in charge  of  sports  on  the\r\n\r\npromotion  of sports activities in the Republic.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  also  looking into the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nestablishing a Singapore Sports Foundation which will\r\n\r\nbe  the  main body for the provision of the necessary\r\n\r\nfunds  for  sports  promotion. I am optimistic,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat when it is established, all sports-loving people\r\n\r\nin  the  Republic, including the business  community,\r\n\r\nwill not hesitate to contribute to the Foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto we have had a very generous response from\r\n\r\nthe business community to our appeals for funds. This\r\n\r\nenthusiastic response from the business community has\r\n\r\nenabled us to send three sports delegations abroad  -\r\n\r\nto  the  Commonwealth  Games at Kingston,  the  first\r\n\r\nGanefo Games in Phnom Penh, and the Asian Games which\r\n\r\nis still going on in Bangkok.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member that when the Sports\r\n\r\nDepartment begins to function fully within  the  next\r\n\r\nfew months, there will be a considerable increase  in\r\n\r\nthe tempo of sports promotion in the Republic with  a\r\n\r\nview  to  achieving higher standards  all  round  and\r\n\r\nensuring   that  the  cream  of  our  sportsmen   and\r\n\r\nsportswomen  will  find  their  way  to  the  top  in\r\n\r\nnational and international competitions. The Ministry\r\n\r\nis now looking for qualified and competent men to man\r\n\r\nthe  Sports Department, and applications for jobs  in\r\n\r\nthe  department  will be called for by  advertisement\r\n\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can also assure the Member that with the\r\n\r\nestablishment of the Sports Department, the  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  be reviewing the position of the various sports\r\n\r\nassociations  to  ensure that they are  properly  and\r\n\r\nsmoothly   run.  The  Member  need  not   fear   that\r\n\r\nofficials, sportsmen and sportswomen sent  abroad  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in international sports competition  will\r\n\r\nbe  going  there  just  for a holiday  and  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nthemselves. We have set a special Selection Committee\r\n\r\nunder the chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the Minister for Social Affairs whose job  is  to\r\n\r\nselect officials and sportsmen and sportswomen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  are worthy to represent Singapore abroad. As you\r\n\r\nwill have seen from the selections made for the Asian\r\n\r\nGames, high standards of performance and conduct  are\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to add, Sir, that under Head 0804\r\n\r\nsubhead  2255,  there is a sum of  $175,000  for  the\r\n\r\npromotion  of  sports.  This sum  represents  various\r\n\r\ndonations  which have been received from civic-minded\r\n\r\nbusiness   firms  and  members  of  the   public   as\r\n\r\ncontributions to the Government for the promotion  of\r\n\r\nsports.   All   existing  sports   associations   are\r\n\r\nregistered  under the Societies Ordinance  and  their\r\n\r\nbona  fides  are  beyond  question.  However,  it  is\r\n\r\npossible that some sports associations are badly run,\r\n\r\nwith  the result that the officials make use  of  the\r\n\r\nname of the association to raise funds without proper\r\n\r\naccounting  of some of these donations.  Should  this\r\n\r\npractice  come  to the notice of the Government,  the\r\n\r\ncase  will  be properly investigated and  appropriate\r\n\r\naction taken where necessary. Here again, Sir, it  is\r\n\r\nup  to the members of the associations themselves  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  they  elect  dedicated  leaders  who  will\r\n\r\ndischarge  their duties properly and  honourably  and\r\n\r\nwill  not  use the association to further  their  own\r\n\r\nselfish  interests or to acquire funds for their  own\r\n\r\nends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> In view of the\r\n\r\nMinister's explanation, Sir, I beg leave to  withdraw\r\n\r\nthe amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1071.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister inform this House how many\r\n\r\npolitical  parties are registered with the  Registrar\r\n\r\nof  Societies?

I have discovered that  the\r\n\r\nefficiency  in  the Department of Social  Welfare  is\r\n\r\npraiseworthy.  In my Meet-the-people sessions,  I  am\r\n\r\nreceiving  less  and  less  complaints  against  this\r\n\r\ndepartment. This goes to show that it is taking great\r\n\r\ncare  in  handling  matters relating  to  the  people\r\n\r\nreceiving   public  assistance.  For   example,   the\r\n\r\npayments  are very prompt and very little trouble  is\r\n\r\ngiven to the recipients of public assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have some other aspects to deal with. The\r\n\r\nrecipients  of  public assistance have complained  of\r\n\r\nthe  inadequacy of such assistance. I  give  you  one\r\n\r\nconcrete  example.  In my constituency,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nwidow  with  two children. Every month  she  receives\r\n\r\npublic  assistance amounting to $36. But out of  this\r\n\r\nshe  has  to  pay $20 for rent, leaving a balance  of\r\n\r\n$16.  According  to  her, she is unable  to  maintain\r\n\r\nthree  persons  on $16 a month. As a result  of  this\r\n\r\ncomplaint,  I have suggested to the person  concerned\r\n\r\nto  do some work, for instance, washing clothes.  She\r\n\r\nhas  said that if this is discovered, then her public\r\n\r\nassistance  allowance will be cut  off.  Under  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, we can see that the public  assistance\r\n\r\ngiven to this family is far from adequate to maintain\r\n\r\nit.  I  would like to ask the Minister whether he  is\r\n\r\nprepared to consider giving some kind of rent subsidy\r\n\r\nor  increase the amount of public assistance in cases\r\n\r\nlike  this, so that the people concerned will be able\r\n\r\nat least to live at subsistence level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise relates to disabled\r\n\r\npersons and children. At the present moment, there is\r\n\r\nno home for them, other than two which are not run by\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  One is run by  the  Salvation  Army\r\n\r\nwhich  takes  care of disabled children and  persons,\r\n\r\nand  the  other  is run by another organisation.  But\r\n\r\nthere is no Government run organisation, institute or\r\n\r\nhome  for these people. I do not know whether in  our\r\n\r\nfuture  plan,  or  even at the  present  moment,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  prepared to set up a  home  to  house\r\n\r\nthese disabled persons. Mr Speaker, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I wish to get an explanation  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Social Affairs. He informed  the  House\r\n\r\nrecently that there was no suggestion to give a  rent\r\n\r\nsubsidy to the recipients of the social welfare dole.\r\n\r\nAs   the   Housing  Board  rents  in  Singapore   are\r\n\r\nrelatively high, it is appropriate that the  Minister\r\n\r\nshould  consider  the possibility of  paying  a  rent\r\n\r\nsubsidy to the recipients of the social welfare dole.\r\n\r\nin  the  absence of a rent subsidy, these  recipients\r\n\r\nare obliged to lodge with their friends or relatives.\r\n\r\nThe  officers  of the Social Welfare Department  will\r\n\r\nthen  consider  that  they  have  received  all   the\r\n\r\nassistance  from  their lodgers.  This  is  an  added\r\n\r\nresponsibility to those who provide lodging for them.\r\n\r\nThis  also  results  in people  refusing  to  provide\r\n\r\nlodging  facilities to recipients of  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nassistance,   because  they   fear   they   will   be\r\n\r\nresponsible. Therefore, I raise the matter  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister with a view to asking him to consider giving\r\n\r\na  rent subsidy to those recipients of Social Welfare\r\n\r\nassistance  in  the hope that it will  help  them  in\r\n\r\ntheir livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Republic of Singapore has practised\r\n\r\ndemocracy  by allowing people to carry out  political\r\n\r\nactivities  freely. All this is under the  charge  of\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar  of  Societies,  which  is  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Social Affairs. There are occasions  when\r\n\r\nsome societies commit a breach of the rules. However,\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar  has  taken no  steps  to  remedy  the\r\n\r\nsituation  and  this has resulted  in  the  societies\r\n\r\ncommitting  further breaches. I  am  not  quite  sure\r\n\r\nwhether  the  department  concerned  is  aware   that\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.  Singapore, which is under  the  control  of\r\n\r\nSyed Ali Redha and Inche Ahmad Haji Taff, are engaged\r\n\r\nin activities which are against the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three types of breaches of the law. First,\r\n\r\nmembers  of  U.M.N.O. Singapore are not elected  from\r\n\r\namongst   their  members  in  Singapore.   This   was\r\n\r\nexplained  by  Inche  Ahmad Haji  Taff,  as  head  of\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.,  at the U.M.N.O. delegates meeting,  a  few\r\n\r\nmonths  back. This was reported in the Berita Harian.\r\n\r\nThe committee of U.M.N.O. Singapore was appointed by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleaders  in  U.M.N.O.  Malaya.  There  is  nobody  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  U.M.N.O, who can dissolve  the  committee.\r\n\r\nWith  this  announcement, it  is  clear  to  us  that\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.  Singapore  is  not  a  political  body   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  but  is  a  part of  U.M.N.O.  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nreceives directions from Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wish to say in this House that U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nSingapore, which is led by Inche Ahmad Haji Taff, has\r\n\r\nnot  yet  shown  its allegiance to  the  Republic  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Although this country is independent  and\r\n\r\nsovereign, U.M.N.O. Singapore even up till today  has\r\n\r\nnever  hoisted  the  Singapore  flag,  not  even   in\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.  House at Changi Road, when  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  celebrates  National  Day.  This   is   to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate their hostility towards Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Inche Ahmad Haji Taff and Syed Ali Redha,\r\n\r\nwho  claim to be leaders of U.M.N.O. Singapore,  have\r\n\r\ncollaborated with the employees of Alsagoff Estate in\r\n\r\ncirculating  application forms for  the  purchase  of\r\n\r\nland in Alsagoff Estate. This is done from the office\r\n\r\nof U.M.N.O. Singapore. These people have been engaged\r\n\r\nin  false  propaganda  to  the  effect  that  if  the\r\n\r\nresidents of Geylang Serai refuse to fill these forms\r\n\r\nand  purchase the land, then the Government  in  1968\r\n\r\nwill  acquire the land and demolish the Malay  houses\r\n\r\nand  instead put up flats. This has proved that Inche\r\n\r\nAhmad Haji Taft and Syed Ali Redha have used U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nand  U.M.N.O.  House  as a tool for  their  nefarious\r\n\r\nactivities  and  selfish ends,  in  order  to  create\r\n\r\nunrest among the Malays, so that they will be hostile\r\n\r\nto the Singapore Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What steps does the Minister propose to instruct the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of Societies to take, and will he  condone\r\n\r\nsuch nefarious acts? I feel that if these people  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to continue with their nefarious activities,\r\n\r\nthey will endanger the safety and peace of Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs  U.M.N.O. Singapore has the same name as  U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nMalaya,  this  will  confuse the people  of  the  two\r\n\r\nindependent countries. U.M.N.O. Singapore is  engaged\r\n\r\nin  undesirable activities controlled by Inche  Ahmad\r\n\r\nHaji  Taff  and  Inche Syed Ali  Redha.  As  U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nMalaya is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nruling party in Malaysia, so is the P.A.P. the ruling\r\n\r\nparty in Singapore. We should, therefore, maintain  a\r\n\r\nclose   relationship  between  the  two  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries. We should avoid indulging in matters which\r\n\r\nwill  lead  to  a  misunderstanding between  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries.  In order to solve this problem,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to suggest to the Singapore Government that  the\r\n\r\nname  of  U.M.N.O. and its flag should be  prohibited\r\n\r\nfrom  being  hoisted in any building,  including  the\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. building in Singapore, until the amendments\r\n\r\nto  the U.M.N.O. Constitution have been submitted  to\r\n\r\nand approved by the Registrar of Societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, under this Head 1001, I would like to  touch\r\n\r\nupon  matters  relating to women in  Singapore  which\r\n\r\nhave been shelved for a very long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as a female representative of the\r\n\r\npeople, I crave your indulgence and ask you to  allow\r\n\r\nme  to  speak  about  the  problems  of  women  after\r\n\r\nSingapore  achieved independence. It  is  undoubtedly\r\n\r\nclear  that  since  the  P.A.P, came  to  power   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  there  have been tremendous  achievements\r\n\r\nall  round  for everybody to see. However, concerning\r\n\r\nthe basic problems of women, up to date there has not\r\n\r\nbeen  much  improvement. Such problems are  still  in\r\n\r\nexistence. As an efficient Government we must not  be\r\n\r\ncomplacent  about our achievements  so  far.  On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  we  must  go  a  step  further  and   work\r\n\r\nprogressively for the people in general, irrespective\r\n\r\nof  sex.  We must contribute to the population  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole,  particularly as there is  no  Opposition.  As\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the  people,  we  are  given  an\r\n\r\nadditional role to play, i.e., to supervise the  work\r\n\r\nof  Government  in general so that we can  truly  say\r\n\r\nthat we have come from the people and shall work  for\r\n\r\nthe  people and we will go back to the people at  the\r\n\r\nproper time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, basically speaking, the social problems\r\n\r\nof  women  are  no  longer of an outstanding  nature.\r\n\r\nCertain efforts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been made by Government to improve the  lot  of\r\n\r\nwomen,  and to do away with the legacies left  behind\r\n\r\nby  the  colonial past. For example, in 1961 the  big\r\n\r\naxe  was  swung to do away with polygamy in Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich  had existed for over one hundred years.  Steps\r\n\r\nhave  also  been taken in some sections to  see  that\r\n\r\nequal  pay is given to women for equal work  so  that\r\n\r\nthe status of women is raised to the same as that  of\r\n\r\nmen. Thus women's social problems have partially been\r\n\r\nsolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More creches and clinics have been set up all over\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Homes for misguided girls and women  have\r\n\r\nalso  been set up in Singapore. Action has also  been\r\n\r\ntaken  to  wipe  out illiteracy among women  folk  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But the efforts exerted so far  to  solve\r\n\r\nthe  problems  of  women  have  not  shown  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has been able completely to  improve  the\r\n\r\nstatus  of  women as a whole and solve  their  entire\r\n\r\nsocial problems basically. The Government should look\r\n\r\ninto  the matter and try to improve the social status\r\n\r\nof women in Singapore as promised by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, circumstances have changed in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Our country has become independent and has\r\n\r\nentered  a new stage in its history, particularly  in\r\n\r\nthe population where one half is female and the other\r\n\r\nhalf is male. In other words, both women and men  are\r\n\r\nequal  in  political potentials and we must encourage\r\n\r\nwomen  folk  to come out and take an active  part  in\r\n\r\nsocial activities together with men so that they  can\r\n\r\nwork   together  shoulder  to  shoulder  in  national\r\n\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also depend on the efforts of women to\r\n\r\nimprove our economy. In this respect, it is the  duty\r\n\r\nof  the  Government to look after the widows and  the\r\n\r\nchildren. Mr Speaker, to remove this injustice,  you\r\n\r\nwill  agree  with  me  that it is  the  duty  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to take effective and immediate action  to\r\n\r\nassist women to stand on their own economically so as\r\n\r\nto change the entire status of women in society. This\r\n\r\nis what we have always been reminding the Government.\r\n\r\nWe have been urging it to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimplement the pledges as mentioned in The Tasks Ahead\r\n\r\nby  setting  up a Women's Institute. This matter  was\r\n\r\nraised  by  me in 1965 when I spoke on  it  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned. The reply given to me  was  that\r\n\r\nthe authorities were still considering the setting up\r\n\r\nof  this  institute. But up to date, Mr Speaker,  we\r\n\r\nare  still awaiting its establishment. There has been\r\n\r\nno  better reply than the one already given  so  far.\r\n\r\nThere  is a Chinese saying to this effect -  that  we\r\n\r\nonly  hear  footsteps, but we do not see  the  person\r\n\r\ncoming  down the ladder. So today we must raise  this\r\n\r\nmatter  again  in  this  House  so  as  to  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  take immediate  steps  to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nWomen's Institute so that women of all races would be\r\n\r\nable, under the banner of this institute, to consider\r\n\r\nthe  problems  of women and try to solve  them  by  a\r\n\r\nconcerted effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I shall stress again the importance of\r\n\r\nsetting  up a Women's Institute in Singapore.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  an institute of an advisory nature only or  just\r\n\r\nfor  discussion purposes or for prestige. It must  be\r\n\r\nan  organisation  charged with the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nworking  out  solutions to women's  problems  and  of\r\n\r\nimproving their employment opportunities and welfare.\r\n\r\nMore important still, this organisation must start  a\r\n\r\ncampaign  for  the improvement of women's  status  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  for example, educating rural women  folk,\r\n\r\nmaking more women understand current affairs and  the\r\n\r\npolitical   situation,   creating   more   employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  for them, encouraging  more  women  to\r\n\r\ntake   part  in  social  activities,  teaching   them\r\n\r\nhandicrafts  and  the importance  of  their  role  in\r\n\r\nnational  construction through their own  labour  and\r\n\r\nsweat. All these are matters which must be considered\r\n\r\nfor the actual raising of women's status so that they\r\n\r\nare able to contribute not only to the needs of their\r\n\r\nown family but also to the needs of society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I hope that the matter I am raising now\r\n\r\nwill  receive better consideration and a better reply\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister. It is my hope that he will  give\r\n\r\nnew hope to the women in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Devan Nair (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe  Home  for the Aged, which is run by  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department, is not serving Muslim and  Indian\r\n\r\nfood.

The public assistance\r\n\r\ngiven  by the Social Welfare Department is not enough\r\n\r\neven  for  one week.

The Member for Geylang Serai,\r\n\r\nI  believe, has also raised the question of whether a\r\n\r\nrecipient  can  be given a rent subsidy.  Sir,  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  policy,  it would  not  be  desirable  to\r\n\r\nprovide  an increase in public assistance  grants  to\r\n\r\ncover rentals being paid for Housing Board flats.  If\r\n\r\nthis  were done, a similar increase would have to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to other public assistance recipients who  are\r\n\r\nnot living in Housing Board flats. And this will mean\r\n\r\na  general  increase in the rate of public assistance\r\n\r\ngrants.  The  present rates of public assistance  are\r\n\r\nalready the highest in this part of the world, and it\r\n\r\nis  not  considered desirable to increase  them.  The\r\n\r\nrates are: $21 for the head of household; $10 for the\r\n\r\nwife;  $8  for each dependant of 16 years and  above;\r\n\r\nand $5 for each dependant below 16 years. The maximum\r\n\r\nallowance payable to a family is $90 per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonth.   In  addition,  the  Ministry  also  provides\r\n\r\nallowances from the Silver Jubilee Fund for  children\r\n\r\nof  widows who are attending school - those  children\r\n\r\nwho  have  to go to schools further away  from  their\r\n\r\nhomes.  I  will be happy, Sir, if Members will  bring\r\n\r\nspecific  cases about the hardship of  widows  to  me\r\n\r\nbecause  their children require assistance for  going\r\n\r\nto  school,  and  I  will personally  look  into  the\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question raised by the Member for Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai,  that  U.M.N.O.

Singapore has been informed that, in view of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  status  as a sovereign  and  independent\r\n\r\nRepublic,  it  would be desirable for  its  name  and\r\n\r\nsymbol  to  be  changed, as they  resemble  those  of\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.  Malaya  and  may give the  impression  that\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.   Singapore  still  has   connections   with\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. Malaya. U.M.N.O. Singapore, however, has not\r\n\r\ncomplied  with  the request to change  its  name  and\r\n\r\nsymbol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new Societies Bill which has been introduced\r\n\r\nin  Parliament,  there  is  provision  requiring  any\r\n\r\nsociety  which  is formed for political  purposes  to\r\n\r\nhave  its  membership confined to Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nand  to  have no affiliation or connection  with  any\r\n\r\nbody  outside  Singapore which is  considered  to  be\r\n\r\ncontrary  to the national interest. The Registrar  is\r\n\r\nempowered to refuse registration of any society  that\r\n\r\ndoes  not meet this requirement. If any such  society\r\n\r\nwhich  has  already been registered fails,  within  a\r\n\r\nreasonable period, to amend its rules to comply  with\r\n\r\nthis requirement, it may be de-registered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Sir, there is no law to compel any\r\n\r\nperson or organisation to fly the Republic flag  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, it will not be possible for any action  to\r\n\r\nbe  taken against U.M.N.O. Singapore for refusing  to\r\n\r\nfly the Republic flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also raised the\r\n\r\nquestion of the possibility\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  establishing a retarded children's hospital.

The Retarded Children's Society is\r\n\r\ndoing   good  work  in  this  respect  for   retarded\r\n\r\nchildren.  On  the medical side, these  children  are\r\n\r\nlooked  after  by the General Hospital  and  the  St.\r\n\r\nAndrew's  Hospital. For the moment, the Ministry  has\r\n\r\nno plan to establish such a hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question raised by the Member for Delta - it\r\n\r\nis  the  same  one which she raised in a question  to\r\n\r\nthis  House - that is the establishment of  a  Women's\r\n\r\nInstitute, I did then say that the matter  was  being\r\n\r\nlooked into by my Ministry. It is now proposed to set\r\n\r\nup   a   Committee  to  study  the  matter  and  make\r\n\r\nrecommendations to the Government. I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nlady Members of this House, including the Member  who\r\n\r\nhas  raised  this matter, will agree to sit  on  this\r\n\r\nCommittee and assist my Ministry in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two questions were raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nMoulmein.  One was about the Old People's  Home.  She\r\n\r\nsaid  that the old people there complained that  they\r\n\r\nare  not  being served with Malay or Indian  food.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to tell her that the food in the Home  for\r\n\r\nthe Aged and other welfare homes is being prepared in\r\n\r\na central kitchen. Unfortunately, there are no Indian\r\n\r\nor  Malay cooks. The number of Indians and Malays  in\r\n\r\nthe Home for the Aged is very small. However, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwill  look into this matter and see whether there  is\r\n\r\nany possibility of preparing Malay and Indian food in\r\n\r\nthe central kitchen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of newspapers, it is the same thing.\r\n\r\nThere are few Malays and Indians in the Home for  the\r\n\r\nAged.  So I do not think that the Home should provide\r\n\r\nnewspapers  for  the  sake  of  one  or  two  people.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am prepared to look into this matter also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now the\r\n\r\nMinister has promised that a Committee will be set up\r\n\r\nto consider the establishment of a Women's Institute.\r\n\r\nOn  behalf of all women in Singapore, I thank him for\r\n\r\nhis very good gift before Christmas!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  can the Minister give me an assurance that  the\r\n\r\nsocial  welfare  allowances of those  living  in  the\r\n\r\nhomes of relatives or neighbours will not be cut?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it the intention of the Minister to accept my\r\n\r\nsuggestion that the U.M.N.O. flag be prohibited  from\r\n\r\nbeing flown on U.M.N.O.

This  amount is to cover the  hire  of  films,\r\n\r\ntelerecording and the purchase of rights of  locally-produced programmes and films. The estimate for  1966\r\n\r\nwas $1 million. The increase of $150,000 for 1967  is\r\n\r\nto provide for more hours of transmission next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of $300,000 for subhead 2260 is for\r\n\r\nProgramme  Production Expenses.

The\r\n\r\nincrease   in   the  number  of   studios   will\r\n\r\nnaturally   increase   the   number   of    live\r\n\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 2261 is in respect of Programme Production\r\n\r\nFees  in the sum of $500,000, and this is for payment\r\n\r\nof  fees  to artistes. It will take us some  time  to\r\n\r\ngive  a  break-down of the increase  in  payments  to\r\n\r\nindividual artistes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to the Member for Anson for his\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that we should endeavour to produce  more\r\n\r\nlocal  programmes. In fact, T.V. Singapura under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture is doing exactly that. In  doing\r\n\r\nso,   we   have   to   take  several   factors   into\r\n\r\nconsideration. I will enumerate a few of them for the\r\n\r\ninformation  of the Member for Anson as well  as  for\r\n\r\nthe general information of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the big difficulties is the scouting for\r\n\r\ntalent which I am sure the Member for Anson will have\r\n\r\nnoticed  in some locally-produced programmes.  In  as\r\n\r\nmuch  as we wish to improve the standard, we  do  not\r\n\r\nfind it possible for the time being to do so, as T.V.\r\n\r\nplays  and  T.V. acts are still in their  infancy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  it  will take some  time  for  local\r\n\r\nplaywrights and artistes to get acquainted  with  the\r\n\r\nT.V. studio.  The  production technique  in  a  T.V.\r\n\r\nstudio is quite different from that in a normal  film\r\n\r\nstudio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next problem is markets for our programmes\r\n\r\nproduced.  If we can secure a market to  sell  or  to\r\n\r\nhire out \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogrammes  produced  by us, it will certainly  help  in\r\n\r\ndefraying   the   cost   of  production.   You   will\r\n\r\nappreciate,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that  it  is   very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to secure a market for our programmes,  as\r\n\r\nsome  of  them are repetitions of programmes  already\r\n\r\nproduced in other countries, and when we compare  our\r\n\r\nprogrammes with theirs, there is quite a wide  choice\r\n\r\nof  preference  in  view of the different  tastes  of\r\n\r\nviewers.  So  we will bear in mind the suggestion  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Anson and will endeavour to  produce\r\n\r\nmore  local programmes taking into consideration  the\r\n\r\nvarious difficulties which I have just mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

What are the  duties  of\r\n\r\nthese  five  officers  of  the  Dewan  Bahasa?   What\r\n\r\nprogress  has been achieved? What efforts  are  being\r\n\r\nmade,  apart from the national language campaign,  to\r\n\r\npopularise the use of the national language?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I believe that the aim of television,\r\n\r\napart from education and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiving  information, is to provide entertainment  for\r\n\r\nits  viewers  who  pay  $36 for  a  licence  a  year.\r\n\r\nWhenever  viewers see a programme on T.V.  Singapura,\r\n\r\nthere  are always interruptions by advertisements.  I\r\n\r\nknow that advertisements provide a lot of revenue  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry to help defray the cost of  television.\r\n\r\nBut  the Ministry should not forget that T.V. viewers\r\n\r\nlike   good   programmes,   and   interruptions    by\r\n\r\nadvertisements in the middle of a programme will  not\r\n\r\nmake them happy, because they have got to take out  a\r\n\r\nlicence   every   year.   I   suggest   that    these\r\n\r\nadvertisements  be  screened  before   or   after   a\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point about T.V. programmes, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nis that there is also a programme on golf which lasts\r\n\r\nabout  one  hour. Surely we do not have many  golfers\r\n\r\nand  golf  enthusiasts. I do not know if the Minister\r\n\r\nhimself plays golf, but I know a number of Ministers,\r\n\r\nincluding the Minister for Finance, who play golf.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  there  are more football,  badminton,  sepak\r\n\r\nraga, even a-go-go enthusiasts among our people.  But\r\n\r\nwe  have  very few football films shown on T.V.  T.V.\r\n\r\nSingapura  should have more programmes  on  football,\r\n\r\nsepak  raga,  etc, for the enthusiasts. Singapore  is\r\n\r\nnow  known  throughout the world as an orchid-growing\r\n\r\ncountry and the number of people who grow orchids  is\r\n\r\nincreasing  day by day. Therefore, we should  have  a\r\n\r\nprogramme on orchid-growing on T.V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As a young and\r\n\r\nindependent nation, we feel it is necessary  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  our  security  and prosperity  so  that  every\r\n\r\ncitizen  will  get  the benefit of  independence  and\r\n\r\nfreedom given by the Government. Co-operation between\r\n\r\none  another  is necessary, especially in  the  local\r\n\r\nPress. The Press can contribute constructively to our\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society. But we must beware  of  foreign\r\n\r\npolitical   publications   which   can   damage   our\r\n\r\nsolidarity.  Also  the  publications  of  a   foreign\r\n\r\nGovernment,   which   is  carrying   out   propaganda\r\n\r\nactivities, are very much at large in our country.  I\r\n\r\nfeel it is necessary to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmention  here  the names of these publications.  They\r\n\r\nare  the Malaya Merdeka and Suara Malaysia issued  by\r\n\r\nthe Malaysian Government. The aim of these two papers\r\n\r\nis  to influence and confuse the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nparticularly  among the Malays. This is entirely  for\r\n\r\nthe  political benefit of their country. We have  not\r\n\r\nforgotten  how  the Malaysian Government  banned  the\r\n\r\nPetir  from Singapore and also the Chermin issued  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Culture. They have been banned  from\r\n\r\ncirculation  in Malaysia. If the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  be  treated  in such a manner by  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment, is that not a challenge to the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment? It is because too much democracy is given\r\n\r\nby  the  Government  of  Singapore  that  the  Malaya\r\n\r\nMerdeka is circulating freely in Singapore. A foreign\r\n\r\nGovernment  can take advantage of us for the  benefit\r\n\r\nof  their  own  country.  As this  may  cause  racial\r\n\r\nconflict  between the various communities, I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the Government should ban these two papers from\r\n\r\ncirculating in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a multi-racial nation, Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  Television Singapura should be  improved  to\r\n\r\nadjust itself to such a policy. Malay programmes  are\r\n\r\nvery  few.  Apart from the Pak Awang Temberang  show,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  other  Malay programme  which  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  constructive.  As  we  are  now  a   fast\r\n\r\ndeveloping   nation,   T.V. programmes   should   be\r\n\r\nconstructive.  For example, there  should  be  dramas\r\n\r\nwhich could be an example to our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the news coverage by Radio Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Television  Singapura, apart from  giving  local\r\n\r\nnews,  there  is also a wide range of  foreign  news,\r\n\r\nincluding   Malaysian  news.  In  this   way,   Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Television Singapura have  played  an\r\n\r\nimportant  role.  They are making a  contribution  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia by making it known to foreign countries. The\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Government should thank  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  of Singapore for announcing Malaysian  news.\r\n\r\nThis shows that Singapore is very compromising in its\r\n\r\nattitude  and  does  not consider  Malaysia  and  its\r\n\r\nneighbours   as   its  enemies.  But  the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment does not appreciate it. Radio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand Television Malaysia have never broadcast\r\n\r\nSingapore news.

In\r\n\r\nsome places, there is no air-conditioning at all.  In\r\n\r\nother  places,  it  is not cold enough.  The  Library\r\n\r\nneeds  cool air, because when people read to  acquire\r\n\r\nmore  knowledge,  they need a cool  temperature.  The\r\n\r\nofficers  in  this Library work in warm surroundings,\r\n\r\nand  when  they have a meeting it is held in  a  warm\r\n\r\nplace. At times they have to open the windows and use\r\n\r\nfans.  In the places where children and adults  read,\r\n\r\nthe  air-conditioners are not as satisfactory as what\r\n\r\nwe  have here now. I feel that it would be better  if\r\n\r\nthe air-conditioning in this Library is improved,  so\r\n\r\nthat with improved air-conditioning, the minds of the\r\n\r\nreaders in the Library will be refreshed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

It appears that Mr D.\r\n\r\nR.  H.

Generally  speaking,   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities have flourished in this country, in  spite\r\n\r\nof  the  fact  that  there have also  been  unhealthy\r\n\r\ncultural activities which have influenced our  people\r\n\r\nadversely,  as  I mentioned on 5th December  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  But the Ministry of Culture's efforts in  the\r\n\r\npromotion  of healthy cultural activities  cannot  be\r\n\r\ndenied.   Moreover,   the  efforts   of   our   civic\r\n\r\norganisations to promote healthy culture should  also\r\n\r\nbe   commended.  There  have  been  achievements  and\r\n\r\nmanifestations   of  our  cultural  activities.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  recently  a Hong Kong All-Star  troupe  of\r\n\r\nsinging artistes visited Singapore. There was also  a\r\n\r\nJapanese cultural mission to Singapore recently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locally, there have also been a number of concerts,\r\n\r\nchoirs, dramas and other healthy cultural activities.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the performance given by foreign as  well\r\n\r\nas  local  organisations will  help  to  promote  the\r\n\r\ninterchange of cultures in South-East Asia and enrich\r\n\r\nour cultural life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point which needs to be mentioned is\r\n\r\nthat  the Ministry of Culture some time ago organised\r\n\r\na  mission which performed in Seremban, Malacca,  and\r\n\r\nelsewhere  in  West Malaysia. That was  part  of  our\r\n\r\ncultural    activities.   Cultural   magazines    and\r\n\r\npublications have also published those items.

When I have the opportunity  in  future,  I\r\n\r\nwill certainly give him the information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point, about the promotion of Malaysian\r\n\r\nculture,  I  will  change  it  to  the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  culture.  That is the main  emphasis.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  point is the promotion of the interchange  of\r\n\r\nthe  various  cultures. Thirdly, the promotion  of  a\r\n\r\nhealthy culture. The next point is the promotion of a\r\n\r\nsense    of    loyalty,   patriotism   and   national\r\n\r\nconsciousness  among those taking  part  in  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities in order to build our Singapore - at  that\r\n\r\ntime  they  used  Malaysia;  I  think  I  should  use\r\n\r\nSingapore  now - and the promotion of the  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities of our civic organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that these four objectives enumerated in\r\n\r\nthe  magazine  should  also be encouraged.  They  are\r\n\r\nstill  valid  because we should  know  our  task  and\r\n\r\nobjectives  at  the present juncture in  relation  to\r\n\r\ncultural  activities. They are, firstly,  to  promote\r\n\r\nhealthy cultural activities; secondly, to promote the\r\n\r\ninterchange  of  the cultures of the  various  races;\r\n\r\nthirdly, to promote goodwill and understanding  among\r\n\r\nthe   various   races;  fourthly,   to   promote   an\r\n\r\nunderstanding of cultural activities and to encourage\r\n\r\npeople  to  devote themselves to cultural  activities\r\n\r\nand  nation-building; fifthly, to raise the  standard\r\n\r\nof cultural activities, be they singing, exhibitions,\r\n\r\nconcerts, dramas or playwriting, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents should be in the nature of promoting\r\n\r\nlove   and  patriotism  towards  one's  country   and\r\n\r\ninstilling in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   minds  of  the  people  a  sense  of   national\r\n\r\nconsciousness and loyalty to our country.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe one important task facing the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nis  to  formulate a complete policy  on  culture  and\r\n\r\ncultural  activities,  to  promote  healthy  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities,  and to help various civic  and  cultural\r\n\r\norganisations  in this respect. It should  also  curb\r\n\r\nall  unhealthy  and pornographic cultural  activities\r\n\r\nwhich  are  poisonous and will endanger  our  nation-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our industrialisation and economic progress has\r\n\r\nbeen  described  as  very  encouraging.  I  can  also\r\n\r\nmention  housing  construction.  On  this  I   should\r\n\r\ncongratulate    the    Minister   concerned.    These\r\n\r\nachievements have contributed greatly to our national\r\n\r\nwell-being.  I  also  hope that  cultural  activities\r\n\r\nunder the guidance of our Ministers can also flourish\r\n\r\nand  bring  us  a  step further to  be  more  culture\r\n\r\nconscious  so that we can show our culture throughout\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now congratulate the Ministry of Culture on\r\n\r\nits  efforts, achievements and work in the  promotion\r\n\r\nof  the  national language during the Language Month,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  also  received the warm  support  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  But  one matter for regret is  that  certain\r\n\r\npolitical  parties  such  as  U.M.N.O.,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis and the Alliance have adopted an attitude of\r\n\r\nindifference to this campaign. This has  enabled  the\r\n\r\npeople  to see through them. Their so-called  support\r\n\r\nfor  the  National Language campaign  is  entirely  a\r\n\r\ndeception trying to fool the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to\r\n\r\ngive  an  answer to what I raised on the 5th of  this\r\n\r\nmonth   when  I  was  making  an  adjournment  speech\r\n\r\ntouching on various points on cultural activities and\r\n\r\ncultural construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Devan Nair</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Sir, we hear pop and\r\n\r\nundesirable songs in the programmes of T.V.

If\r\n\r\nnot, can he look into that in future?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there are undesirable scenes in pictures\r\n\r\nfeaturing James Bond. These scenes also attract young\r\n\r\npeople  and  spoil  them. Why  do  we  not  ban  such\r\n\r\npictures?  Even if we do not ban them, we can  censor\r\n\r\nthe  undesirable  scenes. I  hope  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture and Social Affairs will take action on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, when there are good programmes on T.V.\r\n\r\nSingapura,  these  are stopped when  they  reach  the\r\n\r\nexciting parts, and advertisements are shown.  People\r\n\r\nwho  are  interested in the programmes are  disgusted\r\n\r\nbecause  of this. As a result, the advertisements  do\r\n\r\nnot  get  into  their  minds.  So  the  aims  of  the\r\n\r\nadvertisements are lost.

It  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant. In addition to that, they should be  heard\r\n\r\nby the public properly. In this connection, I wish to\r\n\r\ntouch on Tamil programmes. I do not want to touch  on\r\n\r\nthe standard of Tamil programmes over the radio. They\r\n\r\nare  not closely listened to by the people. Recently,\r\n\r\nthe   radio   wave-length  was  changed   for   Tamil\r\n\r\nprogrammes. Whatever changes are brought about by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  be for the better.  But  in  this\r\n\r\n.case, it has produced the reverse effect. There  are\r\n\r\na  lot of disturbances in the broadcasts. At times we\r\n\r\ncan hear everything except Tamil programmes over this\r\n\r\nwave-length.

Generally speaking, the vote for the whole  of\r\n\r\nthe Culture Ministry is still very small. I feel that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has not allotted sufficient funds  to\r\n\r\nit  to  carry  out cultural activities, although  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has explained in a roundabout-way that  the\r\n\r\nother  Ministries have been allotted  funds  for  the\r\n\r\ncarrying out of activities relevant to culture.  Some\r\n\r\ntime  ago  I  read  certain  news  items  about   our\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intention  to  organise  an  Afro-Asian\r\n\r\ncultural  festival. But there is no such  vote  under\r\n\r\nthis  Ministry. Also the expenditure as  allotted  at\r\n\r\npresent  is  not  enough to meet other  expenses.  If\r\n\r\nthere  are  not enough funds available, how  can  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  carry out such activities? If the water  in\r\n\r\nthe  tank  is  so very shallow, how is  the  Minister\r\n\r\ngoing  to swim freely in it? How is he able  to  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  limited  funds to  carry  out  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities?  That is one query I would  like  him  to\r\n\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang spoke without guts  and  I  am\r\n\r\nsorry for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  the  Member  for Delta to  give  some  specific\r\n\r\nexamples to substantiate her criticism.

Everybody\r\n\r\nknows that culture and art are part and parcel of the\r\n\r\nspiritual   life  of  the  people,  especially   when\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  now a newly-independent  country  with\r\n\r\nfull sovereignty, and when the thinking and the sense\r\n\r\nof  patriotism of the people need to be  fostered  in\r\n\r\naddition to being achieved through education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These objectives are to be achieved both through\r\n\r\neducation  and  cultural activities. At  the  present\r\n\r\nstage  of  our independence, if we do not  have  good\r\n\r\ncultural  programmes which can  lead  the  people  to\r\n\r\nmarch forward in the right direction, but allow  them\r\n\r\nto have filthy ideas and thoughts emanating from evil\r\n\r\nand  yellow culture, then it would be detrimental  to\r\n\r\ntheir well-being and they would not be encouraged  to\r\n\r\nseek   advancement  and  progress.  Without   healthy\r\n\r\ncultural programmes, the people will not be  able  to\r\n\r\nmarch  forward to progress. On the other  hand,  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  indulging themselves in filthy, yellow  and\r\n\r\ncheap entertainment. Therefore, we feel that at  this\r\n\r\njuncture it is necessary for us to educate the people\r\n\r\nand  also carry out cultural activities to guide them\r\n\r\ntowards  nation-building, and  in  this  respect  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture has a great role to play. We have\r\n\r\nto   unite  the  various  races  together  into   one\r\n\r\ncommunity and the cultures of the various races  into\r\n\r\none national culture. But when we look around we find\r\n\r\nthat filthy cultures and activities outnumber healthy\r\n\r\ncultural activities. Everywhere in the State  we  can\r\n\r\nfind  yellow culture in the form of books, magazines,\r\n\r\nmosquito newspapers, advertisements, etc., which  are\r\n\r\nrampant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also a great number of pornographic\r\n\r\npublications.  The  Ministry has  also  taken  action\r\n\r\nagainst such publications, but is this tanta-mount to\r\n\r\nthe   complete  eradication  of  yellow  and   filthy\r\n\r\ncultural activities? The answer is `No'. The sex  and\r\n\r\nyellow  culture  mongers are capable of  infiltrating\r\n\r\ninto  every  nook and corner of our society.  In  the\r\n\r\npast,  our  anti-yellow culture campaign was  carried\r\n\r\nout vigorously. But due to subsequent relaxation, the\r\n\r\nyellow culture mongers have again raised their heads.\r\n\r\nIf we look at certain advertisements in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\nnewspapers  or the walls of lavatories, we  will  see\r\n\r\nvulgar and filthy pictures and drawings which are the\r\n\r\nwork of corrupted minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that half of our present population\r\n\r\nconsist  of youths. The type of education  that  they\r\n\r\nreceive at their formative age is very important.  At\r\n\r\nsuch   an  age,  they  are  susceptible  and   easily\r\n\r\ninfluenced,  and  if  they are subject  to  the  evil\r\n\r\ninfluence  of  yellow culture,  what  will  be  their\r\n\r\nfuture  and what will become of our country?  Members\r\n\r\nof  Parliament have stressed the seriousness of  this\r\n\r\nproblem  and  have  put forward  suggestions  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister. But what do we get in return? The  Minister\r\n\r\nturns  a deaf ear to our suggestions which have  been\r\n\r\nmade in all earnestness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we see when we look at advertisements in the\r\n\r\nnewspapers?  They  try to induce  people  to  go  for\r\n\r\nabortion  and  encourage them to go  and  see  filthy\r\n\r\npictures.  Such advertisements and publications  will\r\n\r\ncause  our  youths  to  deteriorate  in  their  moral\r\n\r\nstandards. How can we then build up our country  with\r\n\r\nthe  contribution and dedication of youths  who  have\r\n\r\nswallowed  the poison from filthy publications'?  How\r\n\r\ncan  we  expect them to fulfil their role in  nation-building? Today we are short of spiritual food and it\r\n\r\nis  the  sacred  task of the Ministry of  Culture  to\r\n\r\ncater  for the spiritual needs of the people  and  to\r\n\r\npromote  healthy  cultural activities,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  a  Cultural Advisory  Council,  as\r\n\r\nsuggested  by  the  Member for Sembawang,  to  enable\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of various sections of the people  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  their ideas for the promotion of  healthy\r\n\r\nculture,  so  that our youths will have  cleaner  and\r\n\r\nhealthier minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to clarify one point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta said that I spoke without guts.\r\n\r\nI  cannot  remember when I spoke like that.

The culture  that  one  sees  in\r\n\r\nSingapore comes mostly from the West. We have to look\r\n\r\ninto  the possibility of altering it to our own  use.\r\n\r\nThis is what the Minister should do. We go on talking\r\n\r\nabout culture instead of adapting Western culture  to\r\n\r\nour own needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta spoke of activities which\r\n\r\nhamper  the advancement of our youngsters. I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  we should appoint a Committee to look into  the\r\n\r\npossibility of leading our youths on the proper  path\r\n\r\nin  order  to make them good citizens in the  future.\r\n\r\nMost of the cultural material imported into Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  been  modified  to  our  own  purpose.  Although\r\n\r\ntextiles  are cheap, clothes are getting shorter  and\r\n\r\nshorter,  so  much so that the human  body  is  being\r\n\r\nrevealed more and more. If this goes on and we cannot\r\n\r\nadapt  imported cultural modes to our  own  use,  our\r\n\r\npeople  will look different. As a democratic country,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot stop these activities, but we must try  to\r\n\r\nadapt them to our own use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, frankly I do\r\n\r\nnot see how this has anything to do with culture.

Mr\r\n\r\nGovindaswamy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): The Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  is  losing his temper. I am not  attacking\r\n\r\nhim.  I  am  only  trying to see how the  morals  and\r\n\r\nbehaviour of the people can be improved. I know  that\r\n\r\nthere are certain things which we cannot do, but I am\r\n\r\nonly   suggesting  that  we  should  look  into   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of setting up a Committee to  study  the\r\n\r\nmatter.  I  realise that Singapore  is  a  democratic\r\n\r\ncountry and that there is a limit to what we can  do,\r\n\r\nbut  we must look into the possibility of seeing what\r\n\r\ncan be done and the manner in which it can be carried\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of the students. If we can instil good\r\n\r\nhabits  in  them when they are young, they  will  not\r\n\r\neasily  change  these  habits.  This  is  what  I  am\r\n\r\nsuggesting. We only talk about culture,  but  we  are\r\n\r\nnot  looking into the possibility of adapting foreign\r\n\r\nculture to our own conditions. We have accepted  four\r\n\r\ndifferent languages as our official languages. So  we\r\n\r\nmust  see what plays and dramas can be introduced  in\r\n\r\nthese  languages. In the same way, we must  also  see\r\n\r\nhow we can adapt imported cultural activities for our\r\n\r\nown benefit. It is no use turning round and asking us\r\n\r\nhow  to  do it. We have given you the power  and  the\r\n\r\nsalary,  and  it  is  up  to you  to  look  into  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  adapting these  activities  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the people. When we talk about culture, we\r\n\r\nmust think seriously and see how we can adapt foreign\r\n\r\ncultural  activities for our own benefit. I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to look into the various means of achieving\r\n\r\nthis  end.  But you must not ignore whatever  Members\r\n\r\nspeak.  You  must  listen to us  and  look  into  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of setting up a committee to  study  the\r\n\r\nmatter. You must.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsider  that  what  we are  saying  is  proper  and\r\n\r\nappropriate so that by the next Budget sittings,  you\r\n\r\nwill  have  been  able to set up  such  a  committee,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  perennially talking  about  culture  and\r\n\r\ncultural activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next subject I wish to speak on is Radio and\r\n\r\nT.V. which  was  also touched on by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein.  Yesterday, a nice film was shown  on  T.V.\r\n\r\nfor  55  minutes, but 10 to 15 minutes of this period\r\n\r\nwas  taken up by advertisements which interrupted the\r\n\r\nfilm  show.  I  agree that we must get  revenue  from\r\n\r\nadvertisements on T.V. In the theatre, advertisements\r\n\r\nare  put  on at the beginning and during the interval\r\n\r\nof  the film show. Why cannot the same thing be  done\r\n\r\non T.V.? Any number of advertisements can be shown at\r\n\r\nthe  beginning and at the end of a picture show,  but\r\n\r\nthey  should  not  appear time  and  again  during  a\r\n\r\npicture show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a lot of complaints about the wave-length used for Tamil programmes. The reception for\r\n\r\nprogrammes  in  English, Chinese and  Malay  is  very\r\n\r\nclear,  but  not for Indian programmes, because  this\r\n\r\nparticular  wave-length  is apparently  a  weak  one.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  authorities  think  that  nobody   will\r\n\r\ncomplain. The people tune in to this particular wave-length, but they do not get any response and they are\r\n\r\nhelpless   to  complain.  The  listeners   to   Tamil\r\n\r\nprogrammes  also pay the same licence fees  as  those\r\n\r\nlistening  to other programmes. I suggest  that  this\r\n\r\nwavelength  should  be changed. In  this  respect,  I\r\n\r\nsupport the Member for Moulmein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to touch on what the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang  said.  I  repeat  that  we  must  have  an\r\n\r\nadvisory  committee  to look into matters  concerning\r\n\r\nculture  instead of continually talking  about  them.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  repeat that the Minister  should  form\r\n\r\nsuch a committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I feel\r\n\r\nthat  when we talk about the problems of culture,  we\r\n\r\nmust have a principle to follow in the first\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstance.   Instead   of   talking   about    culture\r\n\r\nnegatively,  we  must talk about  it  positively  and\r\n\r\nconstructively. When we talk about yellow culture and\r\n\r\npornography  on the one hand, we must, on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  realise  that  there  is  a  principle  behind\r\n\r\nculture. Negative measures to wipe out yellow culture\r\n\r\nor  contain  it  are useless. We must  take  positive\r\n\r\nsteps  to promote healthy cultural activities in  all\r\n\r\nways  so  that  when  yellow  culture  is  beating  a\r\n\r\nretreat, the vacuum will then be filled with  healthy\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now look at what the Government is doing in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the vote to be given to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture. I feel that the vote is too little. Whatever\r\n\r\nexplanation  is  given,  I  feel  that   when   these\r\n\r\nEstimates are framed, certain defects will be noticed\r\n\r\nbecause  the Budget is unable to show us the  various\r\n\r\ntypes  of  cultural activities that will  be  carried\r\n\r\nout.  Although the Minister for Finance has said that\r\n\r\na lot of money has been spent on cultural activities,\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure is not broken down and analysed  for\r\n\r\ndiscussion in the Committee of Supply. So I hope that\r\n\r\nin  future  all  expenditure in respect  of  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  will be listed in the Estimates  so  that\r\n\r\nwhen we are in Committee of Supply we are able to  go\r\n\r\nthrough this matter item by item. That is my view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very\r\n\r\ngood  to  have  such an enthusiastic  debate  on  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of culture. I will deal first  with  the\r\n\r\ncomments  made  by the Member for Kampong  Kembangan.\r\n\r\nThe  first  point  he has raised is about  the  Dewan\r\n\r\nBahasa and what its achievements are. It is difficult\r\n\r\nto  give  full details of its achievements,  but  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the national language is popular  in  the\r\n\r\nCity  State, where 75 per cent of the population  are\r\n\r\nChinese,  is enough to show that at least  the  Dewan\r\n\r\nBahasa  is doing its best to encourage the  study  of\r\n\r\nthe   national  language.  We  are  now   considering\r\n\r\nexpanding this organisation into a Research Institute\r\n\r\ninto  Languages and Culture. When this  is  done,  it\r\n\r\nwill   not  only  deal  with  publications  but  also\r\n\r\nresearch  into the various languages and cultures  of\r\n\r\nour people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On T.V. advertisements, the Member was not the only\r\n\r\none to raise it. Of course, to the viewers it may  be\r\n\r\nannoying  to  see  an advertisement  popping  out  in\r\n\r\nbetween very exciting moments of a film. But from the\r\n\r\nbusiness  man's  point of view, that is  exactly  the\r\n\r\ntime  you hope to catch the attention of the viewers.\r\n\r\nAnyway,  as we have explained many times, we have  to\r\n\r\ninclude advertisements to help defray the expenses of\r\n\r\nrunning the radio and T.V. From radio and T.V. alone\r\n\r\nin  1966  we got $4,629,000, and from this  money  we\r\n\r\nwere  able  to  get better programmes  for  T.V. and\r\n\r\nradio.  By next year we may get more than $5  million\r\n\r\nfrom advertisements. I can assure you, Sir, that much\r\n\r\nof  the money received will be used to acquire better\r\n\r\nquality films as well as programmes for our viewers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has also mentioned\r\n\r\nabout  programmes for golf players, and asked why  we\r\n\r\nshould  have them. I have to enlighten him by  saying\r\n\r\nthat  the programme on golf and bowling is introduced\r\n\r\non  T.V. and  over the radio to cater for  a  cross-section  of our viewers. We must not forget  that  we\r\n\r\nare  a  multi-racial, multi-cultural, as  well  as  a\r\n\r\nmulti-religious population, and we  have  to  give  a\r\n\r\nchance  to every section. There are only three  films\r\n\r\non   bowling.  Whenever  programmes  on   sport   are\r\n\r\nincluded,  the popularity of the sport is taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration. For instance, there have been films on\r\n\r\nthe  World  Cup  soccer matches,  wrestling,  boxing,\r\n\r\netc.,  and  whenever possible good matches  of  local\r\n\r\nsport, such as soccer, badminton, and sepak raga  are\r\n\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to orchid-growing, sometime back in the\r\n\r\nseries of Woman's World, there were talks on orchids:\r\n\r\nfor  example, how to recognise the different species,\r\n\r\nand  how they are grafted. Also the production  of  a\r\n\r\nprogramme on orchids will take time. However, we will\r\n\r\nlook  into the suggestions put forward by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Kampong Kembangan and other Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai raised the question of\r\n\r\nforeign  publications, and he specifically  mentioned\r\n\r\nSuara Malaysia and Merdeka. He advocated their banning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore Government is  aware  of  these\r\n\r\npublications.

I\r\n\r\nassure  the Member for Geylang Serai that action  has\r\n\r\nalready been taken on his suggestion by the Singapore\r\n\r\nHigh Commission in Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Malay films and films in general, it is a\r\n\r\nquestion of staff. We are very short of staff who are\r\n\r\nable  to  produce  programmes,  particularly  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  language. There is only one Malay  producer\r\n\r\nfor the radio, and he is now mobilised into the Army.\r\n\r\nFor  television,  we have three producers.  With  the\r\n\r\nremoval to the new Television Centre, we have two big\r\n\r\nand  two small studios as compared with one temporary\r\n\r\nstudio  in  the  old Broadcasting House.  With  these\r\n\r\nfacilities and with more staff, we hope to be able to\r\n\r\nimprove the production of Malay programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for news from Radio Malaysia and T.V. Malaysia, I\r\n\r\nthink that those who have been listening to the  news\r\n\r\nfrom T.V. Malaysia will agree that, in fact, there is\r\n\r\nno  news  at all about Singapore. But this is  beyond\r\n\r\nour  control. It does not mean that we have to follow\r\n\r\nthe  same  narrow-minded policy of  not  letting  our\r\n\r\nviewers  know what is happening in this part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld, including Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kapor has mentioned about air-conditioning the National Library. In fact, this\r\n\r\nsuggestion has been put forward by us since 1962. But\r\n\r\nowing  to the high recurrent cost, the matter has  to\r\n\r\nhe  shelved. Everybody will welcome more  comfort  in\r\n\r\nthe  National Library, not only for workers  but  for\r\n\r\nchildren and other sections of the population. But we\r\n\r\nhave  to  bear  in mind the financial burden  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. On the other hand,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomparatively  speaking, the standard  of  living  in\r\n\r\nSingapore can be considered to he very high:  if  not\r\n\r\nthe highest, then the second highest in this part  of\r\n\r\nthe  world.  And at this time of nation-building, we\r\n\r\nshould  not make the people too comfortable, or  they\r\n\r\nwill  become too soft, such as going to the  National\r\n\r\nLibrary  to read in an air-conditioned room. If  this\r\n\r\nis  the type of population we are producing, I do not\r\n\r\nthink our nation can survive very long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, coming to the point raised by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Telok Blangah on public relations between\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary  of the Singapore Turf  Club  and  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times, I am afraid the relationship  between\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary of the S.T.C. and the reporters of the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  is  not  our  concern.  We  have  not\r\n\r\nreceived  a copy of the complaint, but if we  receive\r\n\r\nit,  we  will  look  into it, But  I  am  afraid  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture cannot interfere too much in  the\r\n\r\nrelationship between other people and the Press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the comments by other Members, generally\r\n\r\nspeaking, the Member for Sembawang wanted me to reply\r\n\r\nto  his ten points, and the Member for Moulmein spoke\r\n\r\nabout  James Bond and other matters. I think  I  will\r\n\r\ncover all their points at one time. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nit is good to hear Members - for instance, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Bukit Merah - asking for more funds to be allocated\r\n\r\nto  the  Ministry  of Culture for  the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nculture. Normally a Ministry is criticised for  over-spending or wasting public funds. Any Ministry would,\r\n\r\nof  course,  welcome more funds,  because  with  more\r\n\r\nmoney you can have more results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have to appreciate that there is such a\r\n\r\nthing  as  priority in the allocation  of  Government\r\n\r\nfunds.  This  Government has to look after  the  rice\r\n\r\nbowl  of  the  people,  housing, education,  health,\r\n\r\nwelfare  and the rest. Without the basic requirements\r\n\r\n-  a  full  stomach,  a roof over  one's  head,  good\r\n\r\nhealth,  a  basic education - one will not have  much\r\n\r\ntime or energy to participate in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncultural  activities. That is why the Government  has\r\n\r\nto  pay  more  attention to these basic  requirements\r\n\r\nfirst.   Notwithstanding  the  small  sum  of   money\r\n\r\navailable for the promotion of culture, the  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  done  its  best  to encourage  healthy  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  and to promote a cultural interchange  in\r\n\r\nour multi-racial society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1959, regular performances of Aneka Ragam\r\n\r\nRakyat  - the people's concert - in the city as  well\r\n\r\nas  the  rural  areas  have brought  about  a  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and appreciation of  our  multi-racial\r\n\r\ncultures.  In 1963 we even went one step  further  by\r\n\r\norganising  the  South-East  Asia  Cultural  Festival\r\n\r\nwhich,  to a certain extent, helped to promote better\r\n\r\ncultural  understanding among the various  people  of\r\n\r\nthis region. The promotion of culture and the task of\r\n\r\nshaping  a  national culture out of  a  diversity  of\r\n\r\ncultures  is  not  the  sole  responsibility   of   a\r\n\r\nMinistry,  in a democratic society like ours,  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  people  - when we say the people,  we  mean  the\r\n\r\nmulti-racial,   multi-religious,  and  multi-cultural\r\n\r\ncitizens o Singapore and in particular the artistes -\r\n\r\nwho can shape the national destiny of our nation. The\r\n\r\nfunction of Government is just to guide them, to give\r\n\r\nthem  encouragement, morally if not  financially.  In\r\n\r\nthis  respect, cultural organisations have since 1959\r\n\r\nresponded very well to our call for a healthy culture\r\n\r\nand  for  a cultural interchange. The marked increase\r\n\r\nin the number of cultural performances, as the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang  has  agreed and has  also  mentioned,\r\n\r\nexhibitions  and plays performed during  this  period\r\n\r\ncompared  to-those of the pre-P.A.P, days  speak  for\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Although  there  was  vitality  in   the\r\n\r\ncultural  field in the past few years,  I  must  say,\r\n\r\nhowever, that there was a lack of concerted effort in\r\n\r\nthe  field  of  creative art; I mean the  meeting  of\r\n\r\nminds among the leaders of different cultural streams\r\n\r\nto  study the problem of cultural integration and the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  a  national  culture.  Most  of  the\r\n\r\nperformances,  whether in the  field  of  music,  the\r\n\r\ndance  or drama, were still foreign-inspired and  did\r\n\r\nnot   reflect  local  conditions,  the   spirit   and\r\n\r\naspirations of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nown  people. Although there were encouraging attempts\r\n\r\nat  local  composition, there was  no  concerted  and\r\n\r\norganised   effort.  This  aspect  of  our   cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment   was  hampered  by  the  unsettled   and\r\n\r\nunstable  political situation which prevailed  during\r\n\r\nthe  two-year  \"romance\" of one but now two  nations.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  life or death of a nation and  its  people\r\n\r\nlooms  over  the political horizon, very little  time\r\n\r\nand  energy can be spared on the promotion of culture\r\n\r\nor  the  finer side of life. Now that there is better\r\n\r\npolitical  stability,  we can devote  more  time  and\r\n\r\nenergy to the cultural aspect of our national life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1967 we will enter a new phase in cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Next  year the  Arts  Council  will  be\r\n\r\nformed  to  assist in the promotion of  the  creative\r\n\r\narts,  such as music, the dance, drama, painting  and\r\n\r\nsculpture.  The  Arts Council will comprise  cultural\r\n\r\nexperts  and leaders from the four cultural  streams.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of this Arts Council, we hope, will\r\n\r\ncapture  the  imagination and  satisfy  some  of  the\r\n\r\naspirations of our people. The Council will  help  to\r\n\r\ntap  the  cultural resources and cultural talents  of\r\n\r\nour young nation for the purpose of nation-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We have also to look after  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of the people. We have inherited in a  multi-racial   and  multi-cultural  nation,  the   cultural\r\n\r\nheritages of four great civilisations -Malay, Indian,\r\n\r\nChinese  and European. But as a nation and a  people,\r\n\r\nwe  should not live in separate cultural compartments\r\n\r\nforever.  Out of the four cultural streams we  should\r\n\r\ntry  to mould something characteristic of our nation.\r\n\r\nOur  music, dancing, drama, painting and other  forms\r\n\r\nof  art should reflect the spirit and aspirations  of\r\n\r\nour  people and our time. This may take time,  but  a\r\n\r\nstart has to be made. The proposed Arts Council  will\r\n\r\nhelp to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngather forces towards this end. To enable the Council\r\n\r\nto  fulfil  this  task, the question of  promoting  a\r\n\r\nnational  cultural  fund  is also  being  considered.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,  an interim cultural workshop,  comprising\r\n\r\nprominent   local   composers,   choreographers   and\r\n\r\nartistes,  is  busily hammering out a  programme  for\r\n\r\nnext  year's music and dance festival. This festival,\r\n\r\nthe  first of its kind ever to be sponsored  by  this\r\n\r\nMinistry  to perform locally, will compose music  and\r\n\r\ndancing  depicting the life, history and  aspirations\r\n\r\nof  our people and our young but dynamic Republic. We\r\n\r\nhave   also  several  other  sub-committees   dealing\r\n\r\nseparately with the promotion of drama, art and other\r\n\r\nsubjects. The activities of all these committees will\r\n\r\ncome under the umbrella of the proposed Arts Council.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  has all along been  encouraging  the\r\n\r\npromotion of healthy culture. We have not at any time\r\n\r\nencouraged  yellow culture, if yellow  culture  means\r\n\r\nthings obscene or vulgar. But it is quite a different\r\n\r\nthing   to  restrict  the  activities  of  a  private\r\n\r\nindividual; for instance, the call to ban. A-Go-Go or\r\n\r\nasking people to cut their long hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We are against anything that  is  obscene\r\n\r\nand  vulgar. But we have to emphasise that the  right\r\n\r\nto  differ is the essence of democracy. The moment  a\r\n\r\nperson  or  the Government demands the  privilege  of\r\n\r\nshaping  others  to its image, taste,  its  likes  or\r\n\r\ndislikes,  then  the whole essence  of  democracy  is\r\n\r\ngone.  Our approach to cultural progress is  positive\r\n\r\nand  not  negative.

Once they  have  odd\r\n\r\njobs  or temporary jobs, at a piece rate or an hourly\r\n\r\nrate,  will  their  public  assistance  allowance  be\r\n\r\nreduced?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is, what is the total amount\r\n\r\nallocated  for  public assistance, and  how  much  is\r\n\r\nderived from public donations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Where the income earned does not exceed  a\r\n\r\ncertain figure in certain circumstances, no deduction\r\n\r\nwill  be  made from the public assistance  allowance.\r\n\r\nThe following are the maximum\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nincomes  allowed for public assistance recipients  in\r\n\r\nvarious circumstances. Single person; maximum  income\r\n\r\nallowed per month without reduction is $10 per month.\r\n\r\nRecipient   with  one  dependant,  $15   per   month;\r\n\r\nrecipient  with not more than four dependants,  about\r\n\r\n$20   per  month;  recipients  with  more  than  five\r\n\r\ndependants,  $25 per month. Thus, in the  case  of  a\r\n\r\nrecipient who has five or more dependants, he will be\r\n\r\nallowed  to earn about $25 per month in any part-time\r\n\r\njob  or  odd job without having his public assistance\r\n\r\nallowance  deducted.  There may,  however,  be  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  special considerations apply and where it  may\r\n\r\nbe  possible  to  assist  the recipients  with  other\r\n\r\nassistance outside the ambit of the public assistance\r\n\r\nscheme.  For  example, a special grant may  be  given\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Silver Jubilee Fund which  is  also  being\r\n\r\nadministered by the Social Welfare Department.

Before the establishment of\r\n\r\nthis Bureau, such people if they wanted to seek aid\r\n\r\nfrom lawyers in legal matters, had to spend at least\r\n\r\nseveral hundred dollars. At present, they need only\r\n\r\npay $1 to get legal advice from the Legal Aid Bureau.\r\n\r\nThis is one example of the Government's achievements\r\n\r\nin helping our people. The achievements of the Legal\r\n\r\nAid Bureau have aroused great interest among the\r\n\r\npeople in South-East Asia. Certain legal officers\r\n\r\nfrom Hong Kong came to Singapore recently to study\r\n\r\nthe achievements and administration of the Legal Aid\r\n\r\nBureau in order to learn from us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have received some complaints from people who\r\n\r\nseek legal aid. They complain that sometimes the\r\n\r\nLegal Aid Bureau does not do their work fast enough.\r\n\r\nSometimes people have to wait for more than eight\r\n\r\nmonths before their complaints or cases can be dealt\r\n\r\nwith. So I would like to ask the Minister whether he\r\n\r\nis aware of this situation and why this is so. Is it\r\n\r\nbecause the Bureau is short-staffed?

He should be aware that\r\n\r\nwithin  the purview of this law, removals  have  been\r\n\r\nenforced  in  cases of disputes between  tenants  and\r\n\r\ndevelopers.  The  developers are  selling  houses  at\r\n\r\nhigher  prices,  and  so the tenants  want  a  higher\r\n\r\ncompensation.  Can  the  Ministry  institute   better\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  deal with the situation? For  instance,\r\n\r\ncertain  tenants who have been asked to  remove  have\r\n\r\nrequested several hundreds of thousands of dollars as\r\n\r\ncompensation.  In  fact, this  is  only  a  one-sided\r\n\r\npicture as presented by a certain section  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the people. But, in fact, certain capitalists  or\r\n\r\nland-owners make use of the procedure under  the  law\r\n\r\nto  demolish houses without the payment of  a  single\r\n\r\ncent to the tenants. There is a provision in the Rent\r\n\r\nControl  Ordinance which says that all  houses  built\r\n\r\nafter  7th  September, 1947, will not be  subject  to\r\n\r\nrent control and that those built before this date  -\r\n\r\nbut   not  in  cases  where  such  houses  have  been\r\n\r\ndemolished and re-built - will be protected  by  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  So the developers usually resort  to  the\r\n\r\nprovisions in the Rent Control Ordinance to  put  the\r\n\r\ntenants in an awkward position. Of course, there  are\r\n\r\nsome  cases  where the tenants request  an  excessive\r\n\r\namount  of money as compensation before they  remove.\r\n\r\nAll  these things contribute to the higher prices  of\r\n\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that under the present Rent Control\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  it  is  not  possible  to  settle   these\r\n\r\ndisputes because the tenants who are protected  under\r\n\r\nthis  Ordinance  take advantage of the  situation  by\r\n\r\nasking  for excessive amounts of compensation  before\r\n\r\nthey  remove. On the other hand, those  who  are  not\r\n\r\nprotected under the law cannot get even a single cent\r\n\r\nbefore they are forced Out of their homes. Therefore,\r\n\r\nmany  unpleasant events take place. I feel this is  a\r\n\r\nvery  grave social problem facing us. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Minister  for  Law  can  formulate  any\r\n\r\nlegislation to prevent such events from taking place.\r\n\r\nI  will go a step further and suggest - this has also\r\n\r\nbeen  suggested by the Member for Choa Chu Kang  that\r\n\r\nif  the Minister could set up an arbitration court on\r\n\r\nrent  and land matters, I feel that the tenants  will\r\n\r\nget  proper  and  adequate compensation.  The  Review\r\n\r\nBoard  can  look  into  rent  conciliation  and   the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  land resettlement. If the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nagreeable  to  the  setting up of  such  a  Board  or\r\n\r\nCommittee,  a  Judge can be asked to be its  Chairman\r\n\r\nand  the  members can consist of the Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nLands,  a  lawyer,  an architect, an  assessor  or  a\r\n\r\nvaluer.  Such a Board or Committee will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nresolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  When\r\n\r\nthe parties concerned cannot come to a settlement,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  Board or Committee should be the final Tribunal\r\n\r\nof  Appeal  and the parties concerned  will  have  to\r\n\r\nabide  by its decision. Both parties should have  the\r\n\r\nright  to  be legally represented before the Tribunal\r\n\r\nand   the  developer  or  landlord  should  meet  any\r\n\r\nexpenses   for  survey  of  the  land.  The   housing\r\n\r\ndevelopers  should not be allowed to  chase  out  any\r\n\r\ntenants before a decision is made by the Tribunal  or\r\n\r\nbefore  the land is approved for development  by  the\r\n\r\nauthorities. I feel that it will be able to speed  up\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  contribute  towards  the   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On matters relating to national development, I will\r\n\r\ntouch on them later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

He  has  referred to the  Control  of  Rent\r\n\r\nOrdinance which protects tenants who occupy buildings\r\n\r\nbuilt  before  the 7th day of September,  1947,  and\r\n\r\nwhich  does not protect tenants who occupy  buildings\r\n\r\nbuilt after that date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Members of this House will\r\n\r\nremember  that  when this Government  first  came  to\r\n\r\npower on the 31st of May. 1959, two provisions of the\r\n\r\nControl  of  Rent  Ordinance were suspended,  namely,\r\n\r\nsection 15 (1) (i) and section 15 (1) (k) . Section 15\r\n\r\n(1)  (i)  dealt with cases where the premises consist\r\n\r\nin  whole or in part of a building or buildings of  a\r\n\r\ntemporary character, and the site thereof is required\r\n\r\nby  the  landlord for the erection of a  building  or\r\n\r\nbuildings  of a permanent character for  which  plans\r\n\r\nhave  been  approved by the local authority;  or  the\r\n\r\nsite  thereof  is  required by the landlord  for  any\r\n\r\npurpose which forms an essential part of any building\r\n\r\nplan  or  project of a permanent character for  which\r\n\r\nplans have been approved by the local authority.  The\r\n\r\nnext  paragraph  (k)  dealt  with  cases  where   the\r\n\r\nlandlord  of  any  premises intends to  demolish  the\r\n\r\npremises  or  any  part thereof for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nrebuilding on the site or part thereof, and the Court\r\n\r\nis satisfied that such demolition is necessary in the\r\n\r\ninterests of public health or town improvement either\r\n\r\nby  reason  of  the  condition  of  the  building  or\r\n\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may repeat myself, both\r\n\r\nparagraphs (i) and (k) have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen suspended. I have received many a representation\r\n\r\nfrom  building developers saying that it is time  for\r\n\r\nthis  suspension to be lifted and to make  these  two\r\n\r\nparagraphs   law   again.  I   have   also   received\r\n\r\nrepresentations from developers suggesting  that  the\r\n\r\nControl  of Rent Ordinance should be limited  in  its\r\n\r\noperation  to  certain specific areas  in  the  city,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  town area. On the other  hand,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember for Ulu Pandan has pointed out, where a tenant\r\n\r\nis  not  protected by the Control of Rent  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nthe  landlord can evict him without any compensation.\r\n\r\nThis is one end of the stick. The other is where  the\r\n\r\ntenant  is protected by the Control of Rent Ordinance\r\n\r\nand holds the landlord to blackmail. I have heard  of\r\n\r\na case where a tenant occupying a small hut asked for\r\n\r\ncompensation  to  the  tune  of  $200,000  from   the\r\n\r\nbuilding developer who, of course, was not willing to\r\n\r\npay  that sum. The net result is that we are  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment considering the implications of the Control of\r\n\r\nRent  Ordinance. We are also considering the  setting\r\n\r\nup  of  a  tribunal  to  look into  the  question  of\r\n\r\nproviding   adequate  compensation  for  tenants   or\r\n\r\nsquatters who are evicted whether or not the premises\r\n\r\nare controlled premises or uncontrolled premises.

Singapore is at the present moment\r\n\r\npractising parliamentary democracy. Our nation is run\r\n\r\non  this  system,  and  so the  Ministry  of  Law  is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the satisfactory implementation  of\r\n\r\nthe democratic system. Not very long ago certain anti-national  elements tried to undermine our  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  in  Singapore. But I do not know whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Law has made any Ministerial  statement\r\n\r\nto  explain the spirit in which Singapore is building\r\n\r\nits  own  nation. This is, of course, regrettable.  I\r\n\r\nalso  know that in taking action against the  anti-national   elements,  our  Minister  of  Defence   is\r\n\r\ndirectly  responsible. I appreciate this fact.  So  I\r\n\r\ncannot  blame the Minister for Law too much  for  not\r\n\r\nexplaining  the  legal aspects of the  constitutional\r\n\r\nposition  under a democratic system. But at  least  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that within the ambit of the law we can  take\r\n\r\nlegislative  action to allow our own people  to  show\r\n\r\ntheir love for the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that we have a national anthem in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  When  it is played in some  cinemas,  for\r\n\r\nexample,   it  is  encouraging  to  note  that   many\r\n\r\nspectators  of  their own accord stand at  attention.\r\n\r\nBut  there  are  still some who refuse  to  stand  at\r\n\r\nattention when it is played. Worst of all, some anti-national elements do not bother to stand up  at  all.\r\n\r\nWhen the national anthem is played, influence is  not\r\n\r\nexerted  on the anti-national elements to  make  them\r\n\r\nrespect  the  anthem.  I  do not  know  whether  some\r\n\r\nlegislative measures can be taken to see that this is\r\n\r\ndone  so  that we may have patriotism all  round.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, I believe that we cannot create patriotism by\r\n\r\npunishment, but, on the other hand,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe must not overlook the fact that we must have some\r\n\r\nlegal restrictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We have noted that\r\n\r\nthe land policy announced in the P.A.P, manifesto has\r\n\r\nnot  been  resolutely adhered to. In  the  past,  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  Government paid more attention to  the  big\r\n\r\nlandlords.  It  did not frame any definite  equitable\r\n\r\npolicy on land. When they drew up the Master Plan for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  it  was  so drawn  up  that  the  general\r\n\r\ninterest of the public was sacrificed to satisfy  the\r\n\r\nbig  landlords. This unrealistic Master Plan has been\r\n\r\namended from time to time. But what is the extent  of\r\n\r\nthe  amendments that would make them more  beneficial\r\n\r\nto  the general public? At the present moment, it  is\r\n\r\nsaid  that  there  is  not enough  land  to  resettle\r\n\r\nfarmers,   or  to  allocate  land  for   some   other\r\n\r\nconstruction  purposes. But I do not  understand  why\r\n\r\nthere  are  still vast areas of vacant land available\r\n\r\nwhich  are  not  acquired by the Government  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes I have mentioned. Some vacant plots of  land\r\n\r\nare  used  as  play  grounds. Some are  reserved  for\r\n\r\nunknown  purposes. I would like to ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether it is possible to make full and better use of\r\n\r\nthe  existing vacant lands for construction  purposes\r\n\r\nor to resettle evicted persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Delta\r\n\r\nhas   referred  to  the  P.A.P. manifesto,  and  has\r\n\r\ncondemned the colonial Government for supporting  big\r\n\r\nlandlords.  I  wonder whether she believes  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. today  is  supporting big landlords.  If  she\r\n\r\nbelieves this, then I would refer her to the deletion\r\n\r\nfrom  our  Constitution,  since  the  separation,  of\r\n\r\nArticle 13 of the Constitution of Malaysia which only\r\n\r\nprovided  for  acquisition of land  with  payment  of\r\n\r\nadequate  compensation. I may say here that  we  have\r\n\r\ndeleted  Article  13  and we  have  no  intention  of\r\n\r\nrestoring it to the Constitution in its present  form\r\n\r\nor in its amended form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Master Plan, she says again that it was\r\n\r\ndrawn up to satisfy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbig landlords, that it has been amended from time to\r\n\r\ntime, but that the amendments have been few. I cannot\r\n\r\nagree  that  the  Master Plan has been  drawn  up  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy the big landlords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She refers to vast areas of lands which have been\r\n\r\nsomewhat  sterilised  for development.  This  is  the\r\n\r\ngreen  belt. She asks why such lands are not acquired\r\n\r\nfor  resettlement or put to better use. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  answer  is simple. In an urban  town  like\r\n\r\nSingapore,  one  must have a green area  around.  One\r\n\r\nmust   reserve  land  for  future  development.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is not looking five years  or  ten  years\r\n\r\nahead.  Being a responsible Government, we must  look\r\n\r\n30  years or 40 years ahead, and when the time comes,\r\n\r\nwe  must have land available for the requirements  of\r\n\r\nthat  age.  When the Member for Delta says  that  the\r\n\r\ndeclaration  of  land as a green belt sterilises  the\r\n\r\nland,  this is not completely true. Green belt  lands\r\n\r\ncan  be  used  for farming. One cannot put  up  flats\r\n\r\nthere, but, besides farming, green belt lands can  be\r\n\r\nused, as the Member has pointed out, for recreational\r\n\r\npurposes or institutional purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise then. Green belt lands serve the\r\n\r\nfollowing useful purposes. They are used or  reserved\r\n\r\nfor essential purposes, such as farming, recreational\r\n\r\nand institutional purposes. The uses allowed in green\r\n\r\nbelt  lands are light type of uses and afford  relief\r\n\r\nin  a  situation where development is not only  urban\r\n\r\nbut  intensively urban. Lastly, green belt lands hold\r\n\r\nscarce lands in reserve for much more intensive  uses\r\n\r\nshould the future requirements of the Republic demand\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  agree with what the Minister has  said  just\r\n\r\nnow,  but as regards the questions I have asked  just\r\n\r\nnow   about  lands  which  are  reserved  for  future\r\n\r\npurposes,  his  reply  is that these  lands  will  be\r\n\r\nreserved for some future use. I agree to this, but  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to know whether he can answer me on  this\r\n\r\npoint. There are certain areas in Singapore which are\r\n\r\nnot  reserved  but are used as recreational  grounds.\r\n\r\nThese playgrounds are not under the control\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the Government, such as a sports stadium.

What the Member is worried about is\r\n\r\nthis. She asks why certain lands are not acquired  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  for  resettlement  of  farmers.  The\r\n\r\nanswer  is  this. We have enough land for farmers  as\r\n\r\nlong  as  these farmers are given not more  than  two\r\n\r\nacres, and for the moment we do not find it necessary\r\n\r\nto  acquire  more private lands for the  purposes  of\r\n\r\nresettlement.

The Member wants to know whether  there\r\n\r\nis  a policy for car parks. The answer is yes, and it\r\n\r\nis  this. Our problem is that there are more and more\r\n\r\nmotor-cars,  motor-bikes,  motor-lorries  and   other\r\n\r\nvehicles  on our roads. A situation has been  reached\r\n\r\nwhere  it  is difficult to find car parking space  in\r\n\r\nthe  city. It is for this reason that the charges for\r\n\r\ncar  parking have been increased. Otherwise, it would\r\n\r\nbe difficult for motorists going into town to find  a\r\n\r\ncar  parking space. Our policy is not to make  money.\r\n\r\nWe  increase the fees not with that object  in  mind,\r\n\r\nbut  to  enable as many motorists as possible to  get\r\n\r\ncar parking spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of car parks. One in multi-storey buildings, like the Multi-storey Car Park, and\r\n\r\nthe  other  is  the Underground Car Park  at  Raffles\r\n\r\nPlace.  Both these car parks are about 100  per  cent\r\n\r\nfull  on  two  or  three days of  the  week,  namely,\r\n\r\nWednesdays and Saturdays, and about 90 per cent  full\r\n\r\non  other  days.  We hope to build  more  car  parks,\r\n\r\neither  multi-storey or underground, and we  have  in\r\n\r\nmind  Colombo Court behind City Hall. We hope to pull\r\n\r\ndown  the  old building there and put up  car  parks.\r\n\r\nBut, as is usual, we are meeting with resistance from\r\n\r\ntenants  who  refuse to move. We also hope  to  build\r\n\r\nmore  car  parks in open spaces, and we have  one  in\r\n\r\nmind along the \"Golden Mile\" at Nicoll Highway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany  a Parliamentarian has received complaints  from\r\n\r\nmembers of his constituency about the siting  of  new\r\n\r\ncar  parks in various areas in their constituency.

The  Estimates  are   rather\r\n\r\nconfusing  and today Members have moved  under  wrong\r\n\r\nheads.  Here  the  Member  for  River  Valley  has  a\r\n\r\nlegitimate question. On the surface of the Estimates,\r\n\r\nthe  Director of Public Works appears to  be  drawing\r\n\r\nonly  $11,700 a year and his Deputy Director $21,240.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I am glad to say that the post  of\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Public Works brings to the  person  who\r\n\r\nholds the post much more than $11,700. In fact,  much\r\n\r\nmore than $21,240. But, at the moment, we have no one\r\n\r\nwho  is  in  the  permanent position of  Director  of\r\n\r\nPublic Works and we do not expect that the post  will\r\n\r\nbe filled next year. So we have made no provision for\r\n\r\nthe  salary  of  the Director. What  appears  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  is, in fact, the total sum  of  the  extra\r\n\r\nemoluments  which will be paid to those  who  act  in\r\n\r\nsubstantive positions. For example, today the  Deputy\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Public Works is acting as Director.  In\r\n\r\naddition  to his salary of $21,240, he will  be  paid\r\n\r\nthe  difference  in basic salary between  his  acting\r\n\r\npost  and  his  permanent post divided  by  two.  The\r\n\r\nDirector  of Public Works, in fact, is paid  a  basic\r\n\r\nsalary  of $1,950. The Deputy Director is paid $1,770\r\n\r\nbasic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Deputy Director acts as Director, he is paid\r\n\r\nthe difference between those two sums divided by two,\r\n\r\nroughly  $90 a month more. In the same way, when  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Director acts as Director, someone below  him\r\n\r\nwill be acting as the Deputy Director and he will  be\r\n\r\nentitled  to an acting allowance. And it  goes  right\r\n\r\ndown.  The  sum  of $11,700 is to make provision  for\r\n\r\nthese acting allowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr S.\r\n\r\nV.

But some defects have appeared and I do\r\n\r\nnot  know  whether it is the fault of the Department.\r\n\r\nLet me give some examples. Certain projects have, all\r\n\r\nof a sudden, been stopped. Work on Ulu Sembawang Road\r\n\r\nbegan  in  September and when I passed by that  place\r\n\r\none day - and it was not on a Sunday - I saw heaps of\r\n\r\nrubbish piled up and no workers in sight. This  is  a\r\n\r\nvery   unsatisfactory  situation  because   it   will\r\n\r\nobstruct the flow of traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also found that some parts of Sun Loong Road\r\n\r\nin Sembawang, which was completed in October, are now -  a  period of a little over one month -  in  a  bad\r\n\r\nstate. I have already written to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the Urban and Rural Services  Committee\r\n\r\nrequesting  him  to investigate the matter.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the  Minister why so many  holes  have\r\n\r\nappeared  in  the  road and why  certain  parts  have\r\n\r\ncollapsed after only a period of one month since  the\r\n\r\nroad  was  completed. Is this due to malpractices  on\r\n\r\nthe part of the contractors?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that certain projects have been\r\n\r\ndelayed  for some time. For instance, in some  areas,\r\n\r\nincluding  Sembawang,  the  construction  of  certain\r\n\r\nroads  was  approved but these projects were  started\r\n\r\nonly  one year after approval. From the point of view\r\n\r\nof  our efficient Government, the rate of progress is\r\n\r\nnot  very  quick.  So I hope that the  Minister  will\r\n\r\ninstruct the department concerned to investigate  the\r\n\r\nreasons  for this delay and take immediate  steps  to\r\n\r\nremedy the situation in order that the department can\r\n\r\nkeep up its good work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

For  instance, the  approval  of  building\r\n\r\nplans  is  delayed for a long time.  A  Malay  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency applied in March or April last year  for\r\n\r\na  permit  to  build  a house at  the  place  he  was\r\n\r\nstaying.  He has not received any reply  for  over  a\r\n\r\nyear  now, and the Building Survey Division  has  not\r\n\r\neven  sent  anybody to inspect the site or  take  any\r\n\r\nsteps to deal with the application. I came to know of\r\n\r\nthis  when  I  toured my constituency in  April  this\r\n\r\nyear.  I  was  surprised  to  hear  this  from   this\r\n\r\nparticular Malay who complained to me. It  is  rather\r\n\r\nsurprising  and unexpected to know that the  approval\r\n\r\nof  building plans can be delayed for more  than  one\r\n\r\nyear  by the Building Survey Division, which is under\r\n\r\nthe   control   and   management  of   an   efficient\r\n\r\nGovernment!  On hearing this complaint, I immediately\r\n\r\ncontacted the head of the Division and found that  it\r\n\r\nwas  true.  He  told me that he would take  immediate\r\n\r\nsteps to send some people over to investigate. Two or\r\n\r\nthree weeks later, the application of this particular\r\n\r\nMalay was approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the example given by me is only one of many\r\n\r\nsimilar   cases  that  happen.  We  know  that   many\r\n\r\nvillagers are ignorant of the procedures with  regard\r\n\r\nto  applications for building permits.  They  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  these  procedures unless they  are  advised  by\r\n\r\nthose  who  are in the know. So I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill   pay   attention  to  this  matter   and   take\r\n\r\nappropriate steps to remedy the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been complaints by certain people\r\n\r\nabout  the arrogant and superior attitude adopted  by\r\n\r\nbuilding  inspectors  towards  them.

I think it is  necessary\r\n\r\nto  give him a rough picture of the Division. In this\r\n\r\nDivision  there  are at present 18  officers  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  applications for the rebuilding of  houses  and\r\n\r\napplications for temporary buildings. Twelve of  them\r\n\r\nare  in  charge  of the rural areas and  six  are  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of the urban areas. Every month the  Division\r\n\r\nreceives  about 70 applications, most of  which  come\r\n\r\nfrom the rural areas. Therefore, each officer has  to\r\n\r\ndeal with about six applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant has, first of all, to get a permit\r\n\r\nfrom  the  landlord and, secondly, to submit  a  plan\r\n\r\nshowing  the nature of reconstruction as against  the\r\n\r\noriginal  plan.  If these two requirements  are  met,\r\n\r\nthen  the  application will be approved very quickly.\r\n\r\nNormally  rural  folks  do not quite  understand  the\r\n\r\nprocedure.  They  merely  submit  a  letter  to   the\r\n\r\nofficers  concerned, saying that they want to  repair\r\n\r\ntheir houses, without even getting the consent of the\r\n\r\nlandlord. And in cases where they get the consent  of\r\n\r\nthe landlord, they do not submit plans. Sometimes the\r\n\r\nplans  do not meet the specifications and, therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  officers concerned ask the applicants to  submit\r\n\r\namended  plans,  which is not done in  time  for  the\r\n\r\nconsideration  of the Division.

No doubt  there  may  be  com\r\n\r\nplaints in the Sembawang Constituency, but the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang should have noted down the date,  time\r\n\r\nand  place  of  the occurrence and, if possible,  the\r\n\r\nnames   of   the  officers  responsible.

We\r\n\r\nknow  that  the Master Plan has to be reviewed  every\r\n\r\nfive  years  in order to incorporate certain  changes\r\n\r\nand  adjustments which are made to keep up  with  the\r\n\r\nchanging conditions. I feel that it is only right and\r\n\r\nproper   to  do  so.  But  I  also  know  that   such\r\n\r\nadjustments or reviews are mainly concerned with  the\r\n\r\nmajor  aspects  of the- plan. For instance,  sometime\r\n\r\nthis  year - I cannot remember which month it  was  -\r\n\r\nthe  Master  Plan after a review was made public  for\r\n\r\nthe  people  to  inspect. But  this  review  was  not\r\n\r\npublicised  as widely as possible so that  the  rural\r\n\r\nfolks  could  also come to inspect it. For  instance,\r\n\r\nabout  a few years ago certain marshy lands were  not\r\n\r\nsuitable  for use in the Master Plan, and  they  were\r\n\r\nmarked out as marshy lands. But after ten years  such\r\n\r\na  situation no longer holds true, because after  the\r\n\r\nland owners and developers had developed the land, it\r\n\r\nbecame housing estates. But this improvement was  not\r\n\r\nnoted in the plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land between the 13th and 15th mile of my\r\n\r\nconstituency  is a good example of this  improvement.\r\n\r\nThe  urban  land  between these  two  milestones  has\r\n\r\nalready  been developed, and yet it is still depicted\r\n\r\nas marshy land in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaster Plan. This is ridiculous. And there are  other\r\n\r\nplaces, similarly improved, which are depicted in the\r\n\r\nMaster Plan as green belt areas, which means that the\r\n\r\nland cannot be used for development purposes. But, in\r\n\r\nactual  fact, these lands have already been developed\r\n\r\nas  housing  estates  and there  are  also  community\r\n\r\ncentres  set up in such areas, in spite of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  some of the houses are illegal structures,  and\r\n\r\nhave  been in existence for many years, and they  are\r\n\r\nstill  depicted  as green belt areas  in  the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan.  And  when  some people apply  for  permits  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  such  lands, they are told by  the  officers\r\n\r\nthat  these areas are green belt areas or barren land\r\n\r\nand approval cannot be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under these circumstances, I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\npay  more  attention to this matter and instruct  the\r\n\r\nofficers  to go to the spot to investigate  if  there\r\n\r\nhave  been  any changes. I would like to  advise  the\r\n\r\nofficers  to  go to the East Coast in  Kallang  Basin\r\n\r\njust  to see what development has already taken place\r\n\r\nthere.  Former certain stretches of beaches have  now\r\n\r\nbeen  developed  into  housing estates,  and  if  the\r\n\r\nofficers  do not go to the sites to make  an  on-the-spot  investigation,  they will  not  know  the  real\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Minister should pay attention to\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have  suggested  and  try  to  improve   the\r\n\r\nsituation,  so  that applications for development  in\r\n\r\ngreen  belt  areas and vacant land  can  be  approved\r\n\r\nexpeditiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I just want to\r\n\r\ninterpose  to  find out whether there is  any  yellow\r\n\r\nculture  in this green belt area. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the Member is\r\n\r\ninterested,  he  should go there to see  for  himself\r\n\r\nwhether or not there is any yellow culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> In reply to the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang, I just want to remind him that my Minister\r\n\r\nhas just now given a very good answer about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe green belts, open space and reserved space in the\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan.

It is true that in the Master Plan there is a new\r\n\r\ntown,  but  at  the  moment the  plan  has  not  been\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary has not given me satisfactory\r\n\r\nanswers  to the questions I have asked.

I have also said  that\r\n\r\nif  the officers concerned should go to the sites  to\r\n\r\nmake  on-the-spot investigations, they will find that\r\n\r\nmany  places  have been changed into housing  estates\r\n\r\nand  not  as  depicted  in the Master  Plan.  If  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary is interested, I  will  bring\r\n\r\nhim round to see such places and he will know whether\r\n\r\nwhat I say is true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what the\r\n\r\nMember for Sembawang wishes to know is why green belt\r\n\r\nareas can become housing estates and some green  belt\r\n\r\nareas  cannot  be  developed. A green  belt  area  is\r\n\r\nmainly  reserved for future development which  is  to\r\n\r\nmeet  our  increasing population in the years  ahead.\r\n\r\nFor  instance,  we reserve certain  areas  for  green\r\n\r\nbelt, so that in 10 or 20 years' time these areas may\r\n\r\nbe  developed  as  housing estates;  or  a  hospital,\r\n\r\nschool,  clinic and roads or some other projects  may\r\n\r\nbe  built  there.  So there is no  point  in  arguing\r\n\r\nfurther  as  to  why  some green belt  areas  can  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped and some cannot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  do  not mean to argue with the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary on this matter. But it is my duty to  bring\r\n\r\nthis  situation to the notice of this House  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  will  pay attention  to  what  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned. For instance, take a certain area. Part of\r\n\r\nit  is  green  belt which is made into a  development\r\n\r\narea, and part of it is not approved as a development\r\n\r\narea. This is not fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I do not wish to prolong\r\n\r\nunnecessarily the sitting today. There  are  only  25\r\n\r\nminutes more. I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  listening  with patience.  Sir,  I  think  town\r\n\r\nplanning generally is a long-term policy which cannot\r\n\r\nbe realised in a short period of three to five years.\r\n\r\nIn deciding on the zoning of a certain area, the town\r\n\r\nplanner  must  take into consideration  the  possible\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and the shape of things to come  in  the\r\n\r\nnext  10,  20  or even 30 years. It is not  possible,\r\n\r\nonce  you have decided on the zoning for a particular\r\n\r\narea, to have it implemented forthwith. I should like\r\n\r\nto  quote one example for the rural area, and another\r\n\r\nexample for the city area. If you look at the  island\r\n\r\nmap  of  the Master Plan, you will notice  there  are\r\n\r\nfour  types of maps - the island map, the  town  map,\r\n\r\nthe  central area map, and the central area programme\r\n\r\nmap.  If  you look at the island map, you  will  find\r\n\r\nthat certain parts of land are zoned as green belt or\r\n\r\nopen  space, and yet when you go down to  the  actual\r\n\r\nsite,  it is all occupied by either squatters,  or  a\r\n\r\nportion  of  it may be even occupied by  one  or  two\r\n\r\npermanent  structures. That does not mean  that  once\r\n\r\nyou  zone a piece of land as green belt, then all the\r\n\r\nsquatters   there   and   even   the   semi-permanent\r\n\r\nstructures  there must be demolished  forthwith,  and\r\n\r\nthe whole area turned into a green belt. The idea  is\r\n\r\nto  reserve  that piece of land, as my colleague  has\r\n\r\npointed out earlier, for possible future development,\r\n\r\nand  also  to  provide sufficient green area  in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  to serve as lungs for the people.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy green belts and open spaces are demarcated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the town map, there are certain areas\r\n\r\nwhich  are zoned as shopping areas, but when  you  go\r\n\r\ndown  to the actual site and carry out a survey, that\r\n\r\nparticular  piece of land may be full of  residential\r\n\r\nhouses.  The idea is that in the next 5 or 10  years,\r\n\r\nin  the  event of urban renewal or if the land  owner\r\n\r\nwishes  to demolish a block of buildings to  rebuild,\r\n\r\nthen  he must comply with the Master Plan provisions,\r\n\r\nand  that  is  to  use that piece of  land  to  erect\r\n\r\npremises for shopping purposes. As I have said,  town\r\n\r\nplanning  is  a  long-term  policy  which  cannot  be\r\n\r\nachieved even in 20 years. I am not aware of areas in\r\n\r\nthe Master Plan zoned as swamps as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuggested by the Member for Sembawang. I do  know  of\r\n\r\nsome  un-fixed  zoning and they are areas  which  are\r\n\r\nshown  as  white in the Master Plan and are known  as\r\n\r\n\"undetermined use\", but I am not aware  of  any  area\r\n\r\nthat is used for swamps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member has referred particularly to the\r\n\r\neast  coast.  I take it that he is referring  to  the\r\n\r\nBedok  reclamation  area and the Kallang  Basin.  The\r\n\r\nreclamation at Bedok and the Kallang Basin is carried\r\n\r\nout with the full knowledge of Government. It is part\r\n\r\nof  a  scheme by Government, in conjunction with  the\r\n\r\nPlanning Department, to reclaim land. This is totally\r\n\r\nirrelevant  to  the  subject  under  discussion.  The\r\n\r\nMember has said that a green belt area two years  ago\r\n\r\nwas so designated as a green belt area and now it  is\r\n\r\nall filled with houses. The reason is that one of two\r\n\r\nthings might have happened. One, there must have been\r\n\r\na re-zoning of that particular area whereby they have\r\n\r\npermitted  residential or other forms of  development\r\n\r\nin  the  green belt area, or houses might  have  been\r\n\r\nerected there without the approval of the Government.\r\n\r\nIf  that  is  the case, they are more  likely  to  be\r\n\r\nsquatters who have erected temporary structures.  But\r\n\r\nit  is  not possible to have an area zoned as a green\r\n\r\nbelt  and then suddenly over a period of three  years\r\n\r\nyou find a new housing estate springing up there.  By\r\n\r\na  new housing estate, I take it that the Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  means permanent structures like  bungalows\r\n\r\nor  semi-detached bungalows and terrace houses. It is\r\n\r\nnot possible, Mr Speaker, Sir. There is provision in\r\n\r\nthe Planning Ordinance - I think it is No. 12 of 1959\r\n\r\n-  to  allow  the  Minister to waive  certain  zoning\r\n\r\nrequirements  for a certain piece of land;  in  other\r\n\r\nwords, to exempt the planning provision applicable to\r\n\r\nthis  piece of land. In short, if a piece of land  is\r\n\r\nzoned  as a shopping area and if an application comes\r\n\r\nin  for  the  erection of buildings  for  residential\r\n\r\npurposes  and  if  the Minister, after  weighing  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, decides that it is more beneficial  to\r\n\r\nhave   this  piece  of  land  for  the  erection   of\r\n\r\nresidential   premises,  then  he  will   waive   the\r\n\r\nrequirements under the Master Plan that this piece of\r\n\r\nland\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  be  used  for shopping purposes. So  there  are\r\n\r\nsufficient  provisions  in the  law  to  enable  some\r\n\r\ndegree  of flexibility so as not to hamper the proper\r\n\r\nand  justified  development for the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  and  for the benefit of our economy.  I  am\r\n\r\nsurprised  the  Member  for  Sembawang  has  put   up\r\n\r\ninstances   like  that,  it  is  very  difficult   to\r\n\r\nunderstand what exactly he has in his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  think it is not necessary for  me  to  argue\r\n\r\nfurther.
