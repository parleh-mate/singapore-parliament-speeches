This  year the Trust expects  to  complete  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of 2,272 units, although the original estimate\r\n\r\nfor  the completion was 3,158 units. The reasons  for\r\n\r\nthis drop are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The delay in the clearance of squatters from Queenstown during the last 24 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Delay in squatter clearance as well as main\r\n\r\ndrainage  and  sewerage  difficulties  at  another\r\n\r\nbuilding site at Macpherson Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Difficulty in the recruitment of technical\r\n\r\nstaff,  particularly architects and engineers,  which\r\n\r\nhas prevented adequate advanced planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clearance of squatters in Queenstown is now\r\n\r\nmaking   satisfactory  headway,  and  the   technical\r\n\r\nstaffing position has improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the second part of the question (b), the Trust in\r\n\r\nits  building programme this year has planned a lower\r\n\r\npercentage of semi-permanent houses carrying  rentals\r\n\r\nof less than $30 per month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy is to make cheap and  economical\r\n\r\nhousing  available  to as many of  the  lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup  as  possible.  There are two  types  of  cheap\r\n\r\nhousing  being  built  by the  Singapore  Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust at present, namely:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Low-cost housing built to the minimum standards\r\n\r\nrequired  and  to  be  let  at  monthly  rentals  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $50  for two-bedroom units,  and  $55  per\r\n\r\nmonth for three-bedroom units. These houses, with  an\r\n\r\nexpected  life  of between 80 and 100 years,  may  be\r\n\r\nclassed as permanent buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Low-rental housing built not quite up to the\r\n\r\nminimum  standards required and to be let at  monthly\r\n\r\nrentals  ranging  between $20 and $30.  These  houses\r\n\r\nhave  a  shorter term of life - about 40 years - and  are\r\n\r\nclassed as semi-permanent buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter type of housing, that is to say, low-rental housing, which is the subject of the Member's\r\n\r\nsecond  part  of  the question, is not  suitable  for\r\n\r\nerection  on valuable sites in urban areas as  it  is\r\n\r\nuneconomical in land, building and maintenance costs,\r\n\r\nand accordingly has been recommended for erection  in\r\n\r\nsuburban  and rural areas. The Singapore  Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust is, in fact, proceeding with a scheme this year\r\n\r\nfor  the  construction  of 200 low-rental  houses  at\r\n\r\nBukit  Panjang  as part of a pilot rural  development\r\n\r\nproject. The greater part of the Trust's construction\r\n\r\nactivity  this year has been planned for urban  areas\r\n\r\nwhere  the  building  of  low-cost  housing  of   the\r\n\r\npermanent  type  has  been  recommended,   and   this\r\n\r\nexplains why fewer low-rental houses are being  built\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MALAYANISATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Public Service)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by the Chief Minister)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

I am sure that the favourable reaction of\r\n\r\nHer  Majesty's Government to our representations  and\r\n\r\nthose of the Federation Government in permitting such\r\n\r\nexports  now  will be received with gratification  by\r\n\r\nhon. Members and by the trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain doubts have been expressed, Sir, in the last\r\n\r\ntwo  days  as  to  the precise meaning  of  the  term\r\n\r\n\"reasonable quantities\". This is a matter on which my\r\n\r\nMinistry would have to use their judgment, and  where\r\n\r\nthey  are  in doubt, they will use their judgment  in\r\n\r\nconsultation with the Colonial Office. The number  of\r\n\r\napplications,  total quantity applied  for,  and  the\r\n\r\nactual demand from China would be some of the factors\r\n\r\nthat  we  shall  take into consideration.  Individual\r\n\r\napplications for, say, up to 2,000 tons will be dealt\r\n\r\nwith  straightaway in my Ministry,  each  application\r\n\r\nbeing  judged on its merits. Applications for  larger\r\n\r\nquantities would be referred to the Colonial  Office.\r\n\r\nI  may  add, Sir, that there is no need for the trade\r\n\r\nto  take  an  unduly pessimistic viewpoint  that  our\r\n\r\ndiscretion will be exercised harshly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter, Sir. Hon. Members will recollect a\r\n\r\nstatement  made by my friend and colleague  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister a few months back that, while  in\r\n\r\nDelhi in December last, together with him, I took  up\r\n\r\nthe  matter of according preferential treatment,  for\r\n\r\nduty  purposes,  to  some commodities  exported  from\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  India  which,  until  now,  were   not\r\n\r\nenjoying  such  treatment.  In  accordance  with  the\r\n\r\ndeclared  policy of this Government to  assist  trade\r\n\r\nand   to   develop   friendly  relations   with   our\r\n\r\nneighbours,  I  again  took the opportunity  to  make\r\n\r\npersonal representations on this subject to the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Commerce of the Government of India\r\n\r\nwhen  I  was  in  Bangalore attending the  E.C.A.F.E.\r\n\r\nconference  last  January.

The ideal of fairness to rich\r\n\r\nand poor alike means that no man should suffer in the\r\n\r\nprosecution or defence of his legal rights  for  want\r\n\r\nof   professional   assistance  and   advice.   Where\r\n\r\ninadequate facilities exist for a citizen of  limited\r\n\r\nmeans  to seek redress through the Courts for a wrong\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been done to him, or to obtain legal  aid\r\n\r\nfor  his defence when he is committed for trial, then\r\n\r\njustice  becomes  a  rationed  commodity  not  freely\r\n\r\navailable to all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efficacy, Sir, and success of any judicial\r\n\r\nsystem  is  dependent on three factors: firstly,  the\r\n\r\nCourts  of  the country must be impartial;  secondly,\r\n\r\nthe  laws  which  they administer must  be  fair  and\r\n\r\nreasonable; and, thirdly, the Courts must  be  freely\r\n\r\naccessible  to  all. As regards the first  condition,\r\n\r\nSir,  there is not the slightest doubt as to the high\r\n\r\nstandards of impartiality attained by our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourts.  In  so  far  as  the  second  condition   is\r\n\r\nconcerned, it can safely be said that we have no laws\r\n\r\nwhich  discriminate between one individual  or  class\r\n\r\nand  another.  It  is  the last requirement,  namely,\r\n\r\naccessibility,    which    requires    our    careful\r\n\r\nexamination.  It is of little comfort to  the  poorer\r\n\r\ncitizen  that  the laws of his country are  fair  and\r\n\r\njust  and  that  the  Courts  are  impartial  if,  in\r\n\r\npractice,  he is debarred from access to  the  Courts\r\n\r\nthrough lack of funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the indigent person's accessibility\r\n\r\nto the Courts has been differently handled in various\r\n\r\ncountries.  England  and  Wales,  Australia,  certain\r\n\r\nEuropean  countries and a number of States  in  South\r\n\r\nand  Central  America, have statutory  provision  for\r\n\r\nlegal  aid.  In  the  United States,  Sir,  organised\r\n\r\nprivate activity has been very marked in some States,\r\n\r\nsuch  as Massachusetts. In that State, although there\r\n\r\nis  no statutory provision in respect of legal aid in\r\n\r\nits  ordinary  civil Courts, the city of  Boston  can\r\n\r\nnone  the  less boast of one of the finest legal  aid\r\n\r\nsocieties in the world and the poor of that city  can\r\n\r\nbe  said to have their legal rights well safeguarded.\r\n\r\nIn  other countries, with small centres of population\r\n\r\nand  where  lawyers  have general  practices,  fairly\r\n\r\neffective  rotation on a charitable  basis  has  been\r\n\r\nworked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last decade, however, there has been\r\n\r\ngreater  reliance placed on legislative measures  for\r\n\r\nthe   provision  of  legal  aid,  for,  with  notable\r\n\r\nexceptions,  experience has shown that,  in  general,\r\n\r\nprivate  effort cannot promise continuity or  provide\r\n\r\nthe  wider  scope that a State can make available  to\r\n\r\nits  people by way of legislation. Although there has\r\n\r\nbeen  diversity of approach in the matter of granting\r\n\r\nlegal aid, the problems that have had to be faced are\r\n\r\nnot  dissimilar, for exactly the same  administrative\r\n\r\nand  judicial  difficulties have  arisen  wherever  a\r\n\r\nsystem of legal aid has been proposed. Thus, there is\r\n\r\nthe  important problem of selection. A means test has\r\n\r\nto be devised so that the financially undeserving are\r\n\r\nprecluded   from   availing   themselves   of   legal\r\n\r\nassistance at the expense of the State, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  prescribes  such a  means  test.  Another\r\n\r\naspect  of  selection,  Sir,  is  that  people   with\r\n\r\nbaseless,  frivolous or vexatious claims or  defences\r\n\r\nshould be debarred from assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bill now before the Assembly, it will be\r\n\r\nobserved  that  in criminal matters a  Judge  of  the\r\n\r\nSupreme Court or District Court, as the case may  be,\r\n\r\nis  required to certify that it is desirable, in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  justice,  that  legal  aid  should  be\r\n\r\nprovided  to  the  applicant. In civil  actions,  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Legal Aid is required to be  satisfied,\r\n\r\ninter alia, that the applicant has reasonable grounds\r\n\r\nfor taking, defending, continuing or being a party to\r\n\r\nany legal proceedings. With regard to criminal cases,\r\n\r\nobjection  has sometimes been raised that  where  the\r\n\r\npublic  defender is a public officer there  would  be\r\n\r\ntwo  representatives of the State on  both  sides  of\r\n\r\ncriminal   proceedings.  This  would  be  a   serious\r\n\r\nobjection if the same department were responsible for\r\n\r\nthe  conduct  of  both prosecution and  defence.  The\r\n\r\nlegal aid organisation which the Bill envisages  will\r\n\r\nnot come under the Attorney-General's Ministry, which\r\n\r\nwill  continue to be responsible for the  conduct  of\r\n\r\nprosecutions,  but it will be under an officer  known\r\n\r\nas  the Director of Legal Aid, whose department would\r\n\r\nbe  quite  separate and distinct  from  that  of  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's. Further, Sir, it must be  pointed\r\n\r\nout  that  it should not be the object of  the  State\r\n\r\nprimarily to obtain convictions. The real aim of  any\r\n\r\njudicial system is to arrive at the truth and to mete\r\n\r\nout  justice. The Director of Legal Aid, by supplying\r\n\r\nthe  proper  balance, will assist in  achieving  this\r\n\r\naim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us at this juncture, Sir, consider what legal\r\n\r\naid  facilities  now exist in Singapore.  Free  legal\r\n\r\nrepresentation  is available only in the  High  Court\r\n\r\nand  in none of the lower Courts. A person may  apply\r\n\r\nto  the High Court for legal aid in forma pauperis in\r\n\r\nall  civil  matters  dealt with in  the  High  Court,\r\n\r\nprovided   that  he  is  not  possessed  of  property\r\n\r\n(excluding wearing apparel and the subject matter  of\r\n\r\nthe  proceedings) exceeding $300 (or in some  special\r\n\r\ncircum-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstances $750) in value and the usual income from  all\r\n\r\nsources of the applicant does not exceed $200 (or  in\r\n\r\nspecial circumstances $300). In addition, free  legal\r\n\r\nrepresentation is provided where necessary to persons\r\n\r\ncharged  with  murder. In so far as legal  advice  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  Sir,  a free service is provided  by  the\r\n\r\nDepartment of Social Welfare. This is a purely advice\r\n\r\nservice and no representation in Court is provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will therefore be seen that the present system of\r\n\r\nlegal  assistance to poor persons is  altogether  too\r\n\r\nlimited to do more than touch the fringe of the need.\r\n\r\nThe  need for an improved legal aid service  is  long\r\n\r\noverdue   and  the  Marshall  Government   can   take\r\n\r\njustifiable  pride in introducing  this  much  needed\r\n\r\nsocial  legislation. The Bill now under consideration\r\n\r\nindicates  the  lines  along  which  we  might   well\r\n\r\nproceed.  There may perhaps be need for modifications\r\n\r\nor amendments as a result of experience gained over a\r\n\r\nperiod,  but as to the general proposition  that  the\r\n\r\ntime  is  long overdue for a comprehensive legal  aid\r\n\r\nservice, there can be little disagreement. Much  work\r\n\r\nand  thought has gone into the drafting of the  Bill.\r\n\r\nAn  officer  of  the  Colonial  Legal  Service  spent\r\n\r\nseveral  weeks  in the Public Solicitor's  Office  in\r\n\r\nSydney,  New  South Wales, studying the  legislation,\r\n\r\npractice and procedure there, and, in the main,  this\r\n\r\nBill,  based on his recommendations, is an adaptation\r\n\r\nto  local  conditions of the New  South  Wales  Legal\r\n\r\nAssistance Act, 1943-1947.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be amiss if, at this stage, I were\r\n\r\nbriefly to outline the main provisions of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3, Sir, provides for the appointment of the\r\n\r\nDirector  of Legal Aid, one or more Deputy  Directors\r\n\r\nand  such number of Assistant Directors as is thought\r\n\r\nnecessary.  All persons so appointed are required  to\r\n\r\nbe  qualified  persons who will  have  the  right  of\r\n\r\nappearance in all Courts in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to clause 4, it is anticipated that the\r\n\r\nDirector of Legal Aid and his assistants will not  be\r\n\r\nin  a position to deal with the volume of cases which\r\n\r\nflow into his office. Provision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas therefore been made in this clause for panels  of\r\n\r\nsolicitors willing to investigate, report and give an\r\n\r\nopinion upon applications for the grant of legal  aid\r\n\r\nand  to  act  for persons receiving legal  aid.  Such\r\n\r\nsolicitors  would be entitled to fees agreed  between\r\n\r\nthemselves and the Director. I would add,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  success of this scheme depends a great  deal  on\r\n\r\nthe  co-operation  of the Bar. Wherever  there  is  a\r\n\r\nscheme  for legal aid, there is bound to be  a  close\r\n\r\nrelationship  between the legal aid organisation  and\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Bar  in  that  territory,  both  as\r\n\r\nindividual advocates and as a collective body. It  is\r\n\r\nof   importance  to  the  cause  of  legal  aid  that\r\n\r\nsolicitors in private practice respond to  the  call.\r\n\r\nThe profession has an ethical interest in seeing that\r\n\r\nno poor person suffers injustice through inability to\r\n\r\nobtain legal assistance or advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill, Sir, makes provision for legal\r\n\r\naid in criminal cases in the Supreme Court and in the\r\n\r\nDistrict  Courts but not in the Magistrates'  Courts,\r\n\r\nfor the expense would be considerable if legal aid in\r\n\r\ncriminal  matters  were extended to the  Magistrates'\r\n\r\nCourts.  Provision  is made for legal  representation\r\n\r\nfor   criminal  appeals  in  respect  of  any  person\r\n\r\nconvicted in the District Court who wishes to  appeal\r\n\r\nto  the  High  Court  and in respect  of  any  person\r\n\r\nconvicted in the High Court who desires to appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe  Court of Criminal Appeal. No specific means test\r\n\r\nis  laid down in respect of legal aid under this Part\r\n\r\nof  the Bill beyond the general requirement that such\r\n\r\nassistance   should  be  extended  only  to   persons\r\n\r\n\"without   adequate  means\".  It  is  not  considered\r\n\r\ndesirable  or necessary where a person's liberty  may\r\n\r\nbe  at  stake to have the rigid means test  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen  devised  for  legal aid in civil  actions.  The\r\n\r\nJudge  is,  however, required to certify that  it  is\r\n\r\ndesirable in the interests of justice that legal  aid\r\n\r\nshould be provided in any particular case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III. Sir, provides for legal representation in\r\n\r\ncivil  actions  in  the Supreme  Court  and  District\r\n\r\nCourts, and in the Magistrates' Courts in maintenance\r\n\r\ncases under the Married Women and Children\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Maintenance) Ordinance, 1949. While legal aid is not\r\n\r\nextended to the Magistrates' Courts, an exception  is\r\n\r\nmade  in respect of maintenance cases in those Courts\r\n\r\nas there is a very real need for legal representation\r\n\r\nin  certain  at least of the cases where wives  claim\r\n\r\nmaintenance  from their husbands for  themselves  and\r\n\r\nfor  their  children  or where  claims  are  made  in\r\n\r\nrespect   of  illegitimate  children.  Questions   of\r\n\r\nmarriage  or paternity may be relevant and are  often\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  prove. The present  position  is  that\r\n\r\nhusbands  frequently have solicitors  whom  they  can\r\n\r\nbetter  afford  to retain appearing on their  behalf,\r\n\r\nwhile  wives invariably attempt to conduct their  own\r\n\r\ncases,  much to their disadvantage. Under  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nlegal  aid  will, of course, be available  to  either\r\n\r\nparty  in  maintenance proceedings. There  is  little\r\n\r\ndoubt, Sir, that more wives than husbands will  avail\r\n\r\nthemselves of this service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made reference, Sir, earlier to the problem\r\n\r\nof  selection  in accordance with the  means  of  the\r\n\r\napplicant. It is never very easy to devise a fair and\r\n\r\nequitable  means test when the Government provides  a\r\n\r\nfree service of any sort, but after much thought,  we\r\n\r\nhave, I think, devised a satisfactory means test.  In\r\n\r\norder  to be eligible for legal aid in civil actions,\r\n\r\nthe  applicant should not be possessed of or entitled\r\n\r\nto   disposable  capital  exceeding  $500   and   his\r\n\r\ndisposable income should not exceed $1,000 per annum,\r\n\r\nthough the Director has discretionary power to  grant\r\n\r\nlegal aid where the applicant's disposable capital is\r\n\r\nbetween $500 and $3,500 and his disposable income  is\r\n\r\nbetween  $1,000  and  $3,000,  in  which  event   the\r\n\r\nDirector  may require a contribution (the details  of\r\n\r\nwhich  are  set  out  in clause 14)  from  the  aided\r\n\r\nperson.   The   terms   \"disposable   capital\"    and\r\n\r\n\"disposable income\" are defined at clause 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 stipulates that where legal aid is granted\r\n\r\nto  more  than  one  party in civil proceedings,  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of Legal Aid is prohibited from acting  for\r\n\r\neither party but shall assign solicitors to act  from\r\n\r\nthe panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a legal aid certificate is obtained by fraud\r\n\r\nor  misrepresentation or where an  aided  person  has\r\n\r\nacted  improperly in bringing or defending any  legal\r\n\r\nproceedings  or  in the conduct of  them,  clause  19\r\n\r\nprovides  that  in  such event  such  person  may  be\r\n\r\nordered  by  the Court or Judge to pay the  costs  of\r\n\r\nboth  the Director or of the solicitor who acted  for\r\n\r\nhim, or the costs of the other party, or the costs of\r\n\r\nboth the Director or such solicitor and such party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general position with regard to costs is\r\n\r\ndetailed   at  clause  21.  The  expression   \"costs\"\r\n\r\nincludes  counsel's fees. The Court  is  required  to\r\n\r\nmake in favour of the aided person the like order for\r\n\r\ncosts as it would have made had the aided person been\r\n\r\nunaided  except,  of  course, against  another  aided\r\n\r\nperson.  The aided person is liable to pay  costs  to\r\n\r\nthe  Director in certain specified circumstances.  It\r\n\r\nmay  be objected that the Bill makes no provision for\r\n\r\nthe payment of costs to a successful non-aided party,\r\n\r\nbut  in  view  of the expense this would involve,  no\r\n\r\nother  solution appears possible. Two points  should,\r\n\r\nhowever,  be borne in mind. Firstly, the Director  is\r\n\r\nmost unlikely to act other than with a full sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and there would  be  no  question  of\r\n\r\nlegal aid being granted except in proper cases;  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,   there  is  some  measure   of   safeguard\r\n\r\ncontained  in  clause 19 which enables  costs  to  be\r\n\r\nrecovered   from  an  aided  person  who  has   acted\r\n\r\nimproperly  in  bringing  or  defending   any   legal\r\n\r\nproceedings or in the conduct of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV deals with the subject of legal advice which\r\n\r\nis  made available to persons resident and present in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  No specific means test is laid  down  for\r\n\r\nlegal  advice but an applicant is required to satisfy\r\n\r\nthe  Director that \"he cannot afford to obtain it  in\r\n\r\nthe ordinary way\". This, Sir, is also the language of\r\n\r\nthe  English Legal Aid and Advice Act, 1949, for,  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  legal advice, it is felt  that  no  more\r\n\r\nrigid  test than this should be prescribed. Provision\r\n\r\nis  made for payment to the Director of a nominal fee\r\n\r\nof  $1  (or such other fee as may be prescribed)  for\r\n\r\nsuch advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject, Sir, of legal advice, it must be\r\n\r\npointed  out  that while injustice  may  arise  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of a poor man being unable to contest a  case\r\n\r\nin  Court, he may also be at a disadvantage  when  he\r\n\r\nwishes  to  ascertain his legal position  and  obtain\r\n\r\nadvice and assistance short of Court proceedings. The\r\n\r\nprovision of facilities for legal advice is  one  way\r\n\r\nof  removing  any  sense of grievance  and  injustice\r\n\r\nwhich may rankle in the mind of a person who, because\r\n\r\nof his limited means, is unable to ascertain what his\r\n\r\nrights  are, and it may be argued, Sir,  that  it  is\r\n\r\nperhaps a good thing to condition the citizen  to  be\r\n\r\nas  mindful of the legal pitfalls which may  confront\r\n\r\nhim as he is of his physical well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, Sir, as a whole is arranged in five Parts\r\n\r\nand provision is made in clause 1 for the Governor to\r\n\r\nappoint different dates for the coming into force  of\r\n\r\nthe different Parts or provisions therein. This would\r\n\r\nenable  the legal aid organisation to start  modestly\r\n\r\nand  to  expand  as the need arises.  It  would  also\r\n\r\nenable  us to control costs. As has been pointed  out\r\n\r\nin  the  explanatory note to the  Bill,  an  accurate\r\n\r\nestimate  of  the costs of operating  the  legal  aid\r\n\r\nscheme  is  not  possible, and  if,  in  the  initial\r\n\r\nstages,  the  provision of legal aid  is  limited  to\r\n\r\nproceedings in the High Court, the costs  are  likely\r\n\r\nto  be in the vicinity of $280,000 per annum. This is\r\n\r\nas near an estimate as can be made at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bar Committee raised objection to the\r\n\r\npowers conferred on the Minister by clause 28 to make\r\n\r\nregulations, and stated that such regulations as  are\r\n\r\nintended to be made should be read together with  the\r\n\r\nBill  so  that all concerned may have the opportunity\r\n\r\nof  considering and, if necessary, criticising  them.\r\n\r\nPreparation  of these regulations, Sir, has  not  yet\r\n\r\nbeen  completed,  but  the Bar  Committee  have  been\r\n\r\nassured  that  they  will  be  consulted  before  any\r\n\r\nregulations are made. Moreover, under subclause  (5)\r\n\r\nof  clause  28,  all such regulations  must  be  laid\r\n\r\nbefore this Assembly and hon. Members can, if they so\r\n\r\nwish,   move   a   resolution  annulling   any   such\r\n\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to quote an extract\r\n\r\nfrom  the  introduction  to  Regional  Heber  Smith's\r\n\r\n\"Justice  and the Poor\" wherein this passage  occurs:\r\n\r\n\"The  very existence of free government depends  upon\r\n\r\nmaking the machinery of justice so effective that the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  a  democracy  shall  believe   in   its\r\n\r\nimpartiality  and  fairness.\" This measure,  Sir,  by\r\n\r\nmaking  the Courts accessible to the indigent person,\r\n\r\nby  affording him skilled defence where necessary and\r\n\r\nby giving him legal advice where he is in doubt as to\r\n\r\nhis  legal rights, will, it is hoped, put an  end  to\r\n\r\nthat oft-repeated jest: \"The Courts of law, like  the\r\n\r\nRitz Hotel, are open to the rich and poor alike!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nproud  to have the privilege of seconding the  motion\r\n\r\nfor  the Second Reading of this Bill. The institution\r\n\r\nof   justice  is  one  thing  for  which  we  can  be\r\n\r\nunreservedly thankful to the colonial power,  but  it\r\n\r\nhas  one drawback, and that is that, in some measure,\r\n\r\nthe  poor  people of the country have no  opportunity\r\n\r\neither to understand their powers under it or to have\r\n\r\nfull access to it; and as long ago as before the war,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  1939, I sought to obtain the assistance  of\r\n\r\nthe Bar at its annual meeting to propound some scheme\r\n\r\nfor free legal aid. A few years ago, Sir, in order to\r\n\r\nshut   me   up,  they  appointed  me  as  a   one-man\r\n\r\ncommittee - and duly rejected my report! I am therefore\r\n\r\nvery  happy  to be in a position today to assist,  in\r\n\r\nsome  measure,  in making possible a  social  service\r\n\r\nwhich   I  consider  essential  in  every  democratic\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you have heard that this Bill is based to a\r\n\r\nlarge extent on the provisions of the New South Wales\r\n\r\nLegal  Assistance Act. Sir, the late Attorney-General\r\n\r\nof New South Wales, Mr Martin, was good enough, when\r\n\r\nI was in Sydney many, many years ago, to give me real\r\n\r\nassistance in understanding their system, and I  must\r\n\r\nconfess that I have acquired a very great respect for\r\n\r\nthe  way in which the people of New South Wales  look\r\n\r\nafter those who are too poor, either for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurposes  of  defence  or for  purposes  of  bringing\r\n\r\naction,  to  obtain legal assistance.  Therefore,  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as my Government took office, we sent,  as  you\r\n\r\nhave  heard my colleague the Minister for Labour  and\r\n\r\nWelfare say, the Registrar of the Supreme Court,  Mr\r\n\r\nTan Thoon Lip, to study this system and on his advice\r\n\r\nand  recommendations, and with his assistance, we now\r\n\r\npresent  a  Bill to you which we hope will remedy  an\r\n\r\nunhappy feature of our legal institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be churlish of me not to recognise the\r\n\r\nassistance that the Bar has, in fact, given by way of\r\n\r\nfree  legal aid to poor persons in the past; but that\r\n\r\nhas been very, very limited in character, and I would\r\n\r\nalso  like to pay public thanks to 25 members of  the\r\n\r\nBar  who  voluntarily put themselves on  my  list  in\r\n\r\norder  to assist those who sought free legal  aid  at\r\n\r\nthe Meet-the-public-sessions. That again, Sir, is not\r\n\r\nfully  adequate to meet the needs of the country  and\r\n\r\nbut for the fact that the clan associations have done\r\n\r\nimmense  good  in the past in arbitration,  we  would\r\n\r\nhave had an outcry for free legal aid much earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is, I understand, to be a suggestion that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill be committed to a Select Committee. Now  I\r\n\r\nwish  the House to know that for months we have  been\r\n\r\nin touch with the Bar Committee. We have received and\r\n\r\ngiven  serious consideration to their views  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  have  incorporated some of them  in  the  Bill\r\n\r\nbefore  you,  but no amount of further  consideration\r\n\r\nwould  convince  us  that the remaining  points  with\r\n\r\nwhich  we  are  at  variance  should,  in  fact,   be\r\n\r\naccepted.  There  is, however, one far  more  serious\r\n\r\nreason  why  this  Bill should not  go  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  You will notice, Sir, that  we  have  not\r\n\r\npresented  any  Bills  today for  First  Reading  for\r\n\r\nsubsequent attention, because we recognise that, as a\r\n\r\nresult  of the constitutional changes which  will  be\r\n\r\ntaking  place tomorrow, there will, in any event,  be\r\n\r\none  of  two  courses  taken by  His  Excellency  the\r\n\r\nGovernor. He will either prorogue this session or  he\r\n\r\nwill dissolve the Assembly. Sir, in either case, even\r\n\r\nin the case of prorogation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  unfinished business before the House will  cease\r\n\r\nto  exist. Therefore, any motion to commit this  Bill\r\n\r\nto  a  Select Committee is a motion to kill it.  This\r\n\r\nBill  seeks to help the poor of the country  to  some\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  assistance from the  Bar  and  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   where   they   need   assistance;    and\r\n\r\nparticularly  assistance  is  needed   when   it   is\r\n\r\nrecognised  that  the large mass  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are not literate in the English  language,\r\n\r\nand  consequently do not know their rights under  our\r\n\r\nsystem  of  justice. I therefore ask hon. Members  to\r\n\r\nbear this in mind and to give their full support  for\r\n\r\na  measure in which I think we can all take pride. It\r\n\r\nmay  well be that it will require amendments  in  the\r\n\r\nlight of experience, but let us not kill an effort to\r\n\r\nwhich  a  great deal of energy, thought and attention\r\n\r\nhas  been  given.  Sir, I do plead  for  the  general\r\n\r\nassent of this House to this provision and that there\r\n\r\nshould  not  be,  in respect of a  matter  so  nearly\r\n\r\ntouching  the  welfare  of  the  people,  any   Party\r\n\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Party\r\n\r\nsupports  the principle of this Bill. I do not  think\r\n\r\nanybody  would seek to take away the credit which  is\r\n\r\nowing  to  the  present Government and its  head  for\r\n\r\nhaving  introduced this Bill. The only difficulty  is\r\n\r\nthis.  I am a member, Sir, of the Committee which  is\r\n\r\nthe  governing  body of advocates and  solicitors  in\r\n\r\nthis  Colony. As the Minister for Labour himself  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  to  make  this  Bill  work  it  requires   the\r\n\r\nunstinted co-operation of the profession. He has said\r\n\r\nthat  the profession has expressed certain doubts  as\r\n\r\nto  the advisability of giving the Minister unlimited\r\n\r\npowers  to  make regulations under clause 28  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.    He  also  knows  that  the  profession   has\r\n\r\nexpressed  certain  views as to the  advisability  of\r\n\r\nmaking champerty by the Crown legal. It is one of the\r\n\r\nbasic principles of English law that anybody who aids\r\n\r\nsomebody else to institute proceedings where  he  has\r\n\r\nno  interest is, in fact, committing a tort.  Now  we\r\n\r\nare  going  to introduce by this Bill a principle  by\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Crown,  or through its  organisation  the\r\n\r\nLegal Aid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment, would be able to aid a litigant in either\r\n\r\nprosecuting or defending a suit without having to  be\r\n\r\npenalised  subsequently  in  costs.  That  raises   a\r\n\r\nquestion of principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of the point that the Chief Minister has\r\n\r\nmade,  that  if this Bill is committed  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, then it lapses. I would ask the  mover  of\r\n\r\nthe   Second   Reading  of  this  Bill  to   consider\r\n\r\nthis - would it not be advisable to hold up the  coming\r\n\r\ninto  operation of this Bill, if it is  passed  today\r\n\r\nthrough all its three stages, until such time as  the\r\n\r\nprofession has been fully consulted, has had time  to\r\n\r\nconsider  the full implications of it,  and  has  had\r\n\r\ntime  to make its views known to the Government?  But\r\n\r\npolitically we support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  welcome  this  Bill. As an  ordinary  layman  not\r\n\r\nknowing much about the law and mixing up with  people\r\n\r\nof  the  poorer  classes, I have always  come  across\r\n\r\ncases of people who were wronged but who did not dare\r\n\r\nto  take  up legal proceedings for fear of  incurring\r\n\r\npayment  of costs if their cases should be  lost.  In\r\n\r\ninstances  like  this, I always feel  that,  although\r\n\r\nthere is justice in law on paper, in effect, in quite\r\n\r\na number of instances it is the money that counts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\n(Mr Lee Kuan Yew) about the Minister being empowered\r\n\r\nto  make regulations as to the costs, I feel that the\r\n\r\nlegal  profession  has been doing very  well  indeed.\r\n\r\nCertified accounts sometimes show that there might be\r\n\r\nan  income of about $11,500 per month! It might  even\r\n\r\nbe  more! I think, if we are going to create a system\r\n\r\nwhereby  wealth  is  going  to  be  distributed  more\r\n\r\nfairly,  such incomes should be scaled  down,  and  a\r\n\r\nprofessional  man should earn, say, roughly  five  or\r\n\r\nsix  times as much as a labourer and no more. I think\r\n\r\nthat  is  the system that is prevailing in  societies\r\n\r\nthat have gone a long way towards socialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In London, as far as I could learn from my first\r\n\r\nvisit, I think a professional man earns no more  than\r\n\r\nthis, and the system in Singapore should tend towards\r\n\r\nthat level. As a matter of good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngesture - and  there  are  so  many  lawyers  in   this\r\n\r\nHouse - it  should  be  good  to  start  with  oneself,\r\n\r\nbecause  then it would really show sincerity  in  the\r\n\r\nideals  of creating a better social system. I  always\r\n\r\nhate  the  idea of wanting to be generous with  other\r\n\r\npeople's money, but I will always welcome people  who\r\n\r\nbegin with themselves, especially when it is a matter\r\n\r\nof  disadvantage to themselves. Sir,  I  welcome  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, I feel that it is\r\n\r\nas  important to know the law as it is to have access\r\n\r\nto  the  Courts  of law. From my experience,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  reason why there are so many  cases  in\r\n\r\nCourt  is  due  to the fact that many people  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand   the   law.  The  legal   advice   system\r\n\r\nincorporated  in the Bill will be more effective  if,\r\n\r\nby  an  administrative way, the legal aid  scheme  is\r\n\r\ndecentralised and more advisory centres  established,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in the rural areas. This  will  obviate\r\n\r\nthe   necessity  of  people  having  to  travel  long\r\n\r\ndistances  to the headquarters of the Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment at Havelock Road. I hope and believe, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat   the  Minister  will  favourably  consider   my\r\n\r\nsuggestion of decentralising the Legal Aid Department\r\n\r\nto reach the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, most of the benefits envisaged in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill will be brought to nought if there  is  no\r\n\r\ncorresponding decentralisation of the Courts of  this\r\n\r\nColony.  I  feel sure that the Government  will  also\r\n\r\nconsider the question of decentralising the Courts. I\r\n\r\nam  aware  that in the past attempts have  been  made\r\n\r\ntowards this end, but I do not know what progress has\r\n\r\nbeen  made.  Many  people in all parts  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nisland  do  visit  the Courts daily,  and  I  may  be\r\n\r\nvoicing the feelings of many people who have not  the\r\n\r\nmoney  even to come to town to seek legal assistance.\r\n\r\nI  do  hope.

What this clause does  is  to\r\n\r\nlay  down the circumstances in which it is lawful for\r\n\r\nthe Government to compel an officer to retire, but it\r\n\r\nis  not mandatory on the Government in the sense that\r\n\r\nthe  Governor is not required to call upon an officer\r\n\r\nto  retire on reaching the age of 55 under  clause  9 (a).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of clause 9 (a) is that it is lawful for\r\n\r\nthe  Government, when an officer reaches the  age  of\r\n\r\n55,  to call upon him to retire from the service, but\r\n\r\nit  is  not  mandatory that he shall be  required  to\r\n\r\nretire.  In  fact, there are a number of cases  where\r\n\r\nofficers  have reached the age of 55, and because  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  in  the public interests  to  continue  an\r\n\r\nofficer in service, he has been allowed to serve  on.\r\n\r\nIn  those  circumstances, there would be no break  in\r\n\r\nservice. If the officer desires to continue to  serve\r\n\r\nafter  55  and if the Government considers  that  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the public service are benefited by  his\r\n\r\nstaying  on,  he remains and his service is  unbroken\r\n\r\nuntil such time as he does retire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated in moving the Second Reading of this\r\n\r\nBill,  the  present  Government policy  is  that  the\r\n\r\nnormal  age  of retirement should be 55. That  policy\r\n\r\nis, of course, subject to exceptions where there are\r\n\r\ncircumstances which justify giving permission  to  an\r\n\r\nofficer to stay on; but the policy, broadly, is based\r\n\r\non considerations at the present time and this is in\r\n\r\nconformity    with   agreement   with    the    Staff\r\n\r\nAssociations. The wording of this clause of the Bill,\r\n\r\nhowever,   in   no   way  prevents   the   Government\r\n\r\nreconsidering  that policy, and if in  the  light  of\r\n\r\nfuture   circumstances,  such  as  the  progress   of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation, the Government wished, as  a  general\r\n\r\nrule,  to ask officers to serve on over 55, it  could\r\n\r\ncertainly do so in so far as the law is concerned.

We, the people of  Singapore,  Sir,\r\n\r\ntook this as a good augury of the possible success of\r\n\r\nour  Merdeka Mission with its modest plan for limited\r\n\r\nfreedom. It did not take us long in London,  Sir,  to\r\n\r\nlearn  that  to  the Colonial Office  the  Washington\r\n\r\nDeclaration  was  a  quixotic document  for  external\r\n\r\ndecoration. \"Liberate Singapore? Do not be infantile;\r\n\r\nwe  need  Singapore more than ever now.  Freedom?  We\r\n\r\nwill  give  them the freedom to serve our interests.\"\r\n\r\nThis,  as we saw it, was the attitude of the Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice,  matured in the tradition of the exploitation\r\n\r\nof  human  beings  the world over. Whilst  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of England seeks the welfare of Britain with\r\n\r\nhumanity,  the Colonial Office seeks the  welfare  of\r\n\r\nBritain at the expense of humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to London, Sir, full of faith in the British\r\n\r\npeople's    liberal    attitude   towards    colonial\r\n\r\nterritories. Historically, we recognised the  radical\r\n\r\nand  humane  difference between the British  approach\r\n\r\nand  that of other European imperial powers. We  were\r\n\r\nconscious of the tragedy of the relationship of  such\r\n\r\nimperial  powers as France, Holland  and  Italy  with\r\n\r\ntheir  colonial peoples, tragedies which  highlighted\r\n\r\nthe genius of the English people in the past in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntransforming their colonies into friends and  allies.\r\n\r\nThe  tradition  started, Sir, many  decades  ago - nine\r\n\r\ndecades  ago. I think it was in 1867 when Canada  was\r\n\r\ngiven self-government, and although until the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  war  that liberal tradition of humanity  towards\r\n\r\none's colonies was limited to the colonies which were\r\n\r\npeopled by British stock, nevertheless after the  war\r\n\r\nthe  statesmanship and humanity of the British people\r\n\r\nfound  a  government which also liberated  such  vast\r\n\r\nAsian  territories  as India, Burma  and  Ceylon.  By\r\n\r\nthese   acts  of  statesmanship,  Britain  not   only\r\n\r\nprevented   a  ghastly  holocaust  and   a   dreadful\r\n\r\nbitterness  and antagonism in Asia, but  the  British\r\n\r\npeople retained for their own welfare, as well as for\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  of  their  former  colonies,  the  very\r\n\r\nvaluable   friendship  and  co-operation   of   these\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it, Sir, that has brought about a reversal\r\n\r\nof this intelligent, humane policy - a reversal by this\r\n\r\npresent  Government?  Why is the  British  Government\r\n\r\ngoing back to the policy of the days of the revolt of\r\n\r\nthe American colonies? Why is Singapore being made an\r\n\r\nexception? I would say this, Sir: There is a reversal\r\n\r\nof policy as far as we can see, but it does not apply\r\n\r\nto Singapore alone. I am under the impression that it\r\n\r\nis  a  complete reversal of policy in respect of each\r\n\r\nand  every colony which has any strategic or economic\r\n\r\nvalue  to  the  United Kingdom.  The  action  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish Government now, Sir, is no longer inspired by\r\n\r\nan  understanding of the necessity to make friends of\r\n\r\nthose  whom they can no longer keep as slaves.  Their\r\n\r\nactions  in  respect of colonies now  spring  from  a\r\n\r\npsychology of fear and hurt pride based on a  feeling\r\n\r\nof  weakness.  \"Many of us are tired of being  kicked\r\n\r\naround,\"  said  a  member of the British  Government,\r\n\r\ndrawing attention to Cyprus, Jordan and Ceylon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night I read another statement, not reported in\r\n\r\nthe  local  Press, by Mr Selwyn Lloyd,  the  British\r\n\r\nForeign Secretary. I read from Time Magazine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  4th June, page 22. Mr Selwyn Lloyd stated  at  a\r\n\r\nTory rally:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We are an island dependent on our overseas trade\r\n\r\nand  our overseas interests. It is essential that  we\r\n\r\nshould  retain  certain  positions  of  strength   at\r\n\r\nwhatever cost.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He   specified  Cyprus  and  Aden  and  Singapore - \"at\r\n\r\nwhatever cost\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We need Singapore now more than ever,\" said the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of  State  for the Colonies  at  a  public\r\n\r\nmeeting; and because they believe they need Singapore\r\n\r\nand  because  they are tired of being kicked  around,\r\n\r\ntheir  hearts are hardened and they will not see  the\r\n\r\nonly fruitful approach is to trust the cooperation of\r\n\r\na  friendly people within the framework of  practical\r\n\r\nguarantees, that we offered. In their present  punch-drunk  state,  they must insist on  overall  colonial\r\n\r\nrule  and  control  by force of  arms.  The  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice, Sir, repeatedly sought to impress us with the\r\n\r\nvital  importance of Singapore as a defence base  for\r\n\r\nthe  free  world.  In  the name of  the  free  world,\r\n\r\nSingapore must remain unfree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conference table, I pointed out, as an honest\r\n\r\nfriend of Britain, the grave dangers involved in  the\r\n\r\nBritish stand that the people of Singapore cannot  be\r\n\r\nfree  so long as Britain needs to maintain a base  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This was not appreciated at the time, Sir.\r\n\r\nHowever, there seems to be an awakening to the effect\r\n\r\non world opinion, and on the opinion of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore, of the British Government's view that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  must  subserve  the  military\r\n\r\ninterests of the free world - a live offering to  their\r\n\r\ngod of brass - S.E.A.T.O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the name of the people of Singapore, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwelcome  the news today that our brothers across  the\r\n\r\nStraits have refused to join this organisation  which\r\n\r\nseeks  to  keep  the  people of Singapore  a  subject\r\n\r\npeople   in   the  name  of  the  free   world.   The\r\n\r\nrealisation,  Sir, of the effect that their  attitude\r\n\r\nwould  have  on  world opinion has not changed  their\r\n\r\nattitude;  it  has  merely changed  their  propaganda\r\n\r\nslant. And now we have speeches by the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  others  that the breakdown of the constitutional\r\n\r\ntalks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  not  on the question of external defence  powers\r\n\r\nbut   for  the  protection  of  Singapore's  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity and population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We note, Sir, that the Australian Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nhurried to the support of the United Kingdom stand. I\r\n\r\nwould  like to make this clear: though the Australian\r\n\r\nGovernment has representatives both in London and  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, at no time has it sought to ascertain the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the  Singapore Government on  the  British\r\n\r\nproposals  nor  has  it  made any  effort  to  obtain\r\n\r\ninformation as to our understanding of the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refer, Sir, to just one speech of the British\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, Sir Anthony Eden,  and  one  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister of Australia, Mr Robert Menzies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read from Reuter's report of Sir Anthony Eden's\r\n\r\nspeech at Norwich, dated 1st June, 1956:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We have massive responsibilities in the island of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and not least to the ordinary  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It  is  not just a  question  of  defence\r\n\r\nbases,  (please note - \"not just a question of defence\r\n\r\nbases\")  important though these are to the  whole  of\r\n\r\nthe  free  world. The liberty and livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\nisland's teeming population are very vulnerable.  We\r\n\r\nhad  to  retain  some safeguards to deal  effectively\r\n\r\nwith  an  emergency. I believe that  many  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore recognise this.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, I read from Reuter's report from\r\n\r\nColombo dated 2nd June of a Press conference given by\r\n\r\nMr Robert Menzies:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Asked: Do you think Britain is justified in\r\n\r\nwithholding  even a modicum of freedom for  Singapore\r\n\r\non  the  question of internal security?  Mr  Menzies\r\n\r\nsaid:  'I do not agree with the implications  of  the\r\n\r\nquestion.  The  United  Kingdom  Government  has  not\r\n\r\ndenied  in  its  proposals  authority  over  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity.  Instead  it has put forward  a  series  of\r\n\r\nproposals under which step by step internal  security\r\n\r\nwill become a matter for the local authorities as the\r\n\r\nlocal authorities become capable of dealing with  it.\r\n\r\nIt  has declined. I think properly, to let the  whole\r\n\r\nof  internal security be given in one hit because  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  disastrous  to  the  overall  security   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, Sir, I read from Reuter's report from\r\n\r\nLondon  dated 1st June, 1956, on the White  Paper  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's constitutional conference, tabled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the British Government in Parliament. This is how\r\n\r\nthe final paragraph reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A principal reason for the failure of the month-long London talks was Britain's refusal to give the\r\n\r\nfinal say in the control of internal security on  the\r\n\r\nisland  to  elected  Singapore  Ministers  after  the\r\n\r\nterritory got internal self-government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  so,  Sir,  we now have the propaganda  slant  on\r\n\r\ninternal security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at what the Rt. Hon. Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd, Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for\r\n\r\nthe  Colonies, and leader of the British  delegation\r\n\r\nto  the constitutional conference, says. Sir, I quote\r\n\r\nfrom  Hansard, Vol. 552 No. 155, 16th May, 1956, Col.\r\n\r\n2017  bottom,  and  top of Col. 2018  (this  was  the\r\n\r\nmorning after the breakdown):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Her Majesty's Government considered it necessary\r\n\r\nto  retain, as a safeguard, the power to make  Orders\r\n\r\nin  Council for Singapore; but were willing to  limit\r\n\r\nthis   power  to  matters  affecting  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  for external defence  and  external\r\n\r\naffairs.  This  constitution  was  refused  by   the\r\n\r\nmajority of the delegation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  that  seems  clear  enough.  Not  one  word  on\r\n\r\ninternal  security, but fortunately there  is  a  lot\r\n\r\nmore,  if  you  will  permit me. In  Col.  2018,  Mr\r\n\r\nAneurin Bevan asks:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Do we understand that what has really happened is\r\n\r\nthat  there is a breakdown almost exclusively on  the\r\n\r\ninterpretation of where the frontiers lie between Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government's rights in the island  and  the\r\n\r\nrights  of the local government in internal security,\r\n\r\nbecause  there appears to be some confusion  on  this\r\n\r\npoint?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>At Col. 2019, Sir, Mr Lennox-Boyd replies:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The right hon. Gentleman's interpretation of the\r\n\r\ncauses  of the breakdown is not by any means correct.\r\n\r\nThe  conference  did not break down  on  the  limited\r\n\r\nfield   of   internal   security.   It   broke   down\r\n\r\nfundamentally  on  two  points.  The  first  was  the\r\n\r\nrefusal to recognise that we must have some power  in\r\n\r\nthe  field  reserved to us in Singapore, of  external\r\n\r\ndefence  primarily, and the wide measure of  external\r\n\r\naffairs,  that  is, some power other than  the  power\r\n\r\ntotally to suspend the constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it broke down on the fact that we could\r\n\r\nnot   accept  a  constitution  for  the  Defence  and\r\n\r\nSecurity   Council  which  would  put  Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  the  United Kingdom  in  a  permanent\r\n\r\nminority  on a body without whose authority we  could\r\n\r\ntake no action, save that of the suspension of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstitution, in the fields by agreement reserved for\r\n\r\nus  and  for which in our generation and historically\r\n\r\nwe would be held responsible. We would, in fact, have\r\n\r\nbeen undertaking responsibility without the power  to\r\n\r\ndischarge it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Still more, Sir. Mr Lennox-Boyd again to Mr Aneurin\r\n\r\nBevan, who kept harping on this business - \" \"Is it not\r\n\r\ninternal security?\" At Col. 2020:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\". . , the right hon. Gentleman is wrong in\r\n\r\nharping on internal security.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now listen to this, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Our interest in internal security has been in its\r\n\r\nimplication and involvement in external defence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Our interest in internal security is only in so far\r\n\r\nas  it affects external defence.\" It seems to me that\r\n\r\nthat  is clear enough, but I find, Sir, that  I  have\r\n\r\none more quotation in this fascinating unravelling of\r\n\r\nBritish propaganda. I refer now, Sir, to Col. 2021 of\r\n\r\nthe same Hansard. We have Mr Geoffrey Lloyd standing\r\n\r\nup.  (You  will remember Mr Geoffrey Lloyd,  Sir - the\r\n\r\nRt.  Hon. Mr Geoffrey Lloyd, M.P., and leader of the\r\n\r\nBritish Parliamentary Delegation, who came but a  few\r\n\r\nshort  weeks  ago  and was our guest.)  Mr  Geoffrey\r\n\r\nLloyd:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Am I right in understanding my right hon. Friend\r\n\r\n(that  is,  Mr Lennox-Boyd) to the effect  that  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty which has arisen relates entirely  to  the\r\n\r\nretention of powers necessary for the carrying out of\r\n\r\ndefence responsibility? If so, those of us who  share\r\n\r\nhis  very deep desire to reach an agreement with  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  delegation will reluctantly conclude  that\r\n\r\nbreakdown at this stage is inevitable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And Mr Lennox-Boyd puts the last nail in his coffin,\r\n\r\nSir, when he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Yes, Sir, I can assure my right hon. Friend that\r\n\r\nhis interpretation is absolutely correct.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  what  is his interpretation? Will you bear  with\r\n\r\nme?  It  is \"the difficulty which has arisen  relates\r\n\r\nentirely to the retention of powers necessary for the\r\n\r\ncarrying out of defence responsibility.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it seems impossible, if language is to\r\n\r\nhave   any   meaning,  that  there   could   be   any\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  of the stand of  the  Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState that the constitutional talks broke down on the\r\n\r\npowers  he required for external defence and internal\r\n\r\nsecurity was merely a side issue and only in  so  far\r\n\r\nas it affected external defence, and yet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have the Prime Ministers of England and Australia\r\n\r\nspeaking   at  radical  variance  with  the  Colonial\r\n\r\nSecretary's  stand. What is the  truth?  And  who  is\r\n\r\nindulging  in  unctuous  inaccuracies  that  seek  to\r\n\r\nmislead decent people? This question is all the  more\r\n\r\npertinent when we come to consider the correspondence\r\n\r\nin  the  next  motion  passing  between  me  and  the\r\n\r\nColonial Office, wherein it is clearly indicated that\r\n\r\nthere   are  only  two  issues  which  separate   the\r\n\r\nSecretary of State from me. One is the appointment of\r\n\r\na Malayan Governor-General as distinct from a British\r\n\r\nHigh Commissioner. And let me make this plain: if  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  Malayan Governor-General, the British  would\r\n\r\nstill  have  the  right  to appoint  a  British  High\r\n\r\nCommissioner as their representative; he would  still\r\n\r\npreside  on  the Defence and Security  Council.  Your\r\n\r\ndelegation,  Sir,  has at all times  sought - we  never\r\n\r\ngave  this  up - the appointment of a Malayan Governor-General  as  a representative of the Queen  with  the\r\n\r\npurely  decorative functions of the Queen  and  as  a\r\n\r\nsymbolic  Head of the State in whom we could coalesce\r\n\r\nthe loyalty of a nascent nation; but the Secretary of\r\n\r\nState is of the opinion that the time is not ripe for\r\n\r\nHis  Excellency  Sir  Robert  Black  to  walk  out  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  House and for a Malayan to walk  in.  For\r\n\r\nthe  Colonial Office, Sir, it is a matter of  British\r\n\r\nprestige in Asian waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question on which we are at issue - the\r\n\r\nonly  other  one - is  that  I  want  the  transfer  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  from  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice to another Ministry. I shall deal with this at\r\n\r\ngreater  length when we come to the question  of  the\r\n\r\ncorrespondence, but  at this stage  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant that the people of England consider how, in\r\n\r\nthe   name  of  anything  decent,  in  the  name   of\r\n\r\nelementary truth, can it be said that the appointment\r\n\r\nof  a  Malayan  Governor-General or the  transfer  of\r\n\r\nSingapore from the Colonial Office in any way affects\r\n\r\ninternal security or external defence. This is a  cry\r\n\r\nfor  truth,  Sir,  and let it not be  a  cry  in  the\r\n\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one other matter before I come to the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  which I wish to touch  upon,  and  that\r\n\r\nconcerns  the repeated statements in the local  Press\r\n\r\nof   the  disunity  amongst  your  delegation.   Sir,\r\n\r\ndisagreements there were - plenty of them - daily, as was\r\n\r\nnatural and to be expected when you remember that the\r\n\r\ndelegation consisted of many, many Parties;  but  let\r\n\r\nthis  he  clearly understood: they were never brought\r\n\r\nout;  all  those  disagreements took  place  at  the\r\n\r\nprivate meetings of the delegation and the remarkable\r\n\r\nthing   about  your  delegation,  Sir,  is  not   the\r\n\r\ndisagreements  behind  the  scenes  but  the   almost\r\n\r\nmiraculous  unity  with which it faced  the  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice.  We quarrelled like cars and dogs behind  the\r\n\r\nscenes.  People threatened people with  bashings  on\r\n\r\nthe  head  but  when  we came to  face  the  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice,  Sir,  we were solid. That is  something  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore do not seem to have realised, and\r\n\r\nsurprising though this may sound to those of you  who\r\n\r\nhave  been subjected to the full barrage of countless\r\n\r\ntales  of disunity, I would like to place on  record,\r\n\r\nwith all sincerity, my pride in the way the Singapore\r\n\r\ndelegation faced the Colonial Office and its  panoply\r\n\r\nof  experts up to the last day when the Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState terminated the conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that on the first day, the\r\n\r\ndelegation  was shaken - so was I - by the  statement  of\r\n\r\nthe  leader  of the Liberal-Socialist delegates  that\r\n\r\nhis Party sought safeguards on internal security, and\r\n\r\nI still say for myself that I think the time was ill-chosen,  but in fairness, Sir, let us admit that  the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialists made their point gently  and  with\r\n\r\nmoderation  and  throughout  the  remainder  of   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  conference, for days and  days,  they\r\n\r\nconducted themselves with dignity and with restraint,\r\n\r\nhonestly  seeking to cooperate with us  and  going  a\r\n\r\nlong,  long  way with us, Sir, I am not  speaking - I\r\n\r\nhave  no  brief  for  the  Liberal-Socialists - of  the\r\n\r\ncontemptible conduct of their President who,  at  the\r\n\r\nheight  of the constitutional conference, went  round\r\n\r\nin  Singapore saying, \"Please, teacher, I can form  a\r\n\r\nGovernment.\"  I  am  not  speaking  of  the  defeated\r\n\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,I  am  speaking of the successful  Members  who\r\n\r\nformed part of the delegation in London. They are  my\r\n\r\npolitical  opponents, it is true, but I  consider  it\r\n\r\ninherent in political democracy that there should  be\r\n\r\nhonest   dealing  between  political  opponents   and\r\n\r\nrespect   for   sincerity,  even  though   there   is\r\n\r\ndisagreement  on policy. On that principle,  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nfairness  and  in view of the attacks to  which  they\r\n\r\nhave been subjected in the Press and in public, I say\r\n\r\nthat  the Liberal-Socialists have been wrongly blamed\r\n\r\nfor the breakdown of the conference. On the contrary,\r\n\r\nSir,  they gave evidence at the most difficult  times\r\n\r\nof  their  anxiety to avoid a breakdown by  accepting\r\n\r\nmajority  decisions without insisting on their  right\r\n\r\nto  make reservations at the conference table. Theirs\r\n\r\nwas  a creditable performance in what must have  been\r\n\r\nto them an acutely difficult time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am conscious, Sir, that there have been persistent\r\n\r\nreports on the part of the English Press in Singapore\r\n\r\nto   make   out  that  the  differences  within   the\r\n\r\ndelegation  caused the breakdown of  the  conference.\r\n\r\nThis  is  understandable when  we  realise  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  English Press does not want freedom  from\r\n\r\ncolonial rule for Singapore and consequently it is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of policy that everything should be  done  to\r\n\r\nheighten the prestige of the Colonial Office  and  to\r\n\r\nsmear the reputation of the Singapore delegation  and\r\n\r\nany  and  every  Singaporean who may prove  to  be  a\r\n\r\nstrong opponent of the Colonial Office. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  repeat, Sir, for the record and for the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore, who I trust know that they can believe me,\r\n\r\nthat there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that the\r\n\r\ndifferences  within the delegation  had  no  material\r\n\r\neffect  in  bringing  about  the  breakdown  of   the\r\n\r\nconference.  The Colonial Office is solely  to  blame\r\n\r\nand  is  solely  responsible for  this  breakdown  in\r\n\r\ninsisting  on  overall  supervision  and  control  of\r\n\r\nfuture  Singapore governments in the name of external\r\n\r\ndefence and external affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come, Sir, to the White Paper which is tabled\r\n\r\nbefore   you  this  morning.  Although  this   is   a\r\n\r\nGovernment Paper, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink  it  is fair to make it known that the Official\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Council of Ministers  who  were  in\r\n\r\nLondon  did  not  and  would not  co-operate  in  its\r\n\r\npresentation,  nor, since it was a  document  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  Ministers, was it  possible  for  me  to\r\n\r\nconsult  the other Members of the delegation  on  its\r\n\r\npresentation.   In   the  circumstances,   Sir,   the\r\n\r\nappointed Ministers who were in London take full  and\r\n\r\ncomplete  responsibility for this Paper.  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nmake  two  observations on it. I am  informed  by  my\r\n\r\nfriend  and  colleague the Chief  Secretary  that  my\r\n\r\nstatement  that the British Government had repeatedly\r\n\r\nrefused   Singapore  the  formation  of  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nbattalion,  although never challenged in London,  is,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  inaccurate. He tells me that the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment - the former one - dropped the question of the\r\n\r\nformation  of  a Singapore battalion because  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties and particularly because of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom's refusal to agree that we should, out of our\r\n\r\nown  money,  pay adequate rates of pay in  excess  of\r\n\r\nwhat they paid. That is a wonderful distinction, Sir,\r\n\r\nand  I hope it will be noted: it is very significant.\r\n\r\nThey   never   openly   refuse,   they   are   merely\r\n\r\nobstructing.  That  is the way  the  Colonial  Office\r\n\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> They never.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> When the Singapore delegation,\r\n\r\nSir,  pointed out to the British delegation that  the\r\n\r\noverall imperial legislative powers which the British\r\n\r\nGovernment sought and which you will find at Annexure\r\n\r\nI,  page  52  of the White Paper, would  cover  every\r\n\r\nfield of public life, the Secretary of State told  us\r\n\r\nthat he was prepared to give us a letter assuring  us\r\n\r\nthat    he   would   not   exercise   those    powers\r\n\r\nunreasonably - the  judge  as to  what  was  reasonable\r\n\r\nbeing,  of  course, the Secretary of  State  for  the\r\n\r\nColonies. We ought to make that clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, for the rest of the Paper, perhaps there\r\n\r\nis nothing new, but let me recapitulate very briefly.\r\n\r\nYou  are  aware  from the tenor of the  debate  which\r\n\r\npreceded the departure of the Merdeka Mission that we\r\n\r\nwere deeply anxious to seek with Britain a friendly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelationship  for the foreseeable future  within  the\r\n\r\nframework  of human dignity. We therefore  asked  for\r\n\r\npolitical freedom within the Commonwealth and planned\r\n\r\nto  respect  British economic and military interests.\r\n\r\nWe  were prepared to remain within the sterling area,\r\n\r\nand   because  we  realised  that  Britain   believes\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  of vital and strategic  importance  to\r\n\r\nher,  we  offered  an  agreement whereby  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  would have the right, at its discretion,  to\r\n\r\nhave  such  naval, military and air installations  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  it deemed necessary,  with  powers  of\r\n\r\nadministration    within   the   areas    of    those\r\n\r\ninstallations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Government expressed the view that a\r\n\r\ntreaty  could  be  unilaterally  denounced,  as   was\r\n\r\nthreatened  in  Ceylon and, in the circumstances,  we\r\n\r\nreluctantly agreed that within the Act giving us  our\r\n\r\nnew  constitution, there should be retained the power\r\n\r\nto control external defence and foreign affairs other\r\n\r\nthan trade, commerce and cultural relations. Finally,\r\n\r\nSir,  to meet the British Government's objection that\r\n\r\nit  was  all very well to have powers but what  about\r\n\r\nthe   sanctions,   we  agreed  that   Her   Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  have the right,  within  the  Act\r\n\r\ngiving  us  our  new  constitution,  to  suspend  our\r\n\r\nconstitution  whenever,  in its  discretion,  it  was\r\n\r\nsatisfied   that   the   Singapore   Government   was\r\n\r\ndishonouring  its  obligations to co-operate  in  the\r\n\r\nefficacious  discharge  of its  external  defence  or\r\n\r\nexternal   affairs  obligations,  whenever   internal\r\n\r\nsecurity so deteriorated as to affect the efficacy of\r\n\r\nexternal   defence,   and  whenever   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  acted ultra vires. That right to  suspend\r\n\r\nthe  constitution was not subject to the Defence  and\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council at any time. It  was  an  absolute\r\n\r\ndiscretion  of Her Majesty's Government.  What  more,\r\n\r\nSir, can a reasonable people give?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We even agreed to a British Chairman of the Defence\r\n\r\nand   Security  Council  which  would   advise   both\r\n\r\nGovernments on external defence and internal security\r\n\r\nmatters and which would seek to iron out disputes  in\r\n\r\nborderline case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By conceding this much, Sir, we had gone well beyond\r\n\r\nour  original  intentions which we had  expressed  in\r\n\r\nthis  very House during the Merdeka debate,  for  the\r\n\r\nretention of these powers in the Act are of so  vital\r\n\r\na  character  that  they mean  that  Britain  retains\r\n\r\nultimate  control of our destiny and we had to  admit\r\n\r\nthat, in the circumstances, what we were prepared  to\r\n\r\nagree  to,  although  much more than  internal  self-government, was radically less than Dominion status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having pushed us back so far, Sir, the Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice  then  indicated its complete  dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nwith  the concessions and under the guise of  seeking\r\n\r\npowers of external defence and foreign affairs - I  use\r\n\r\nthose  words advisedly \"under the guise\", by  way  of\r\n\r\npretence  of  seeking powers of external defence  and\r\n\r\nexternal  affairs - they asked that they should  retain\r\n\r\nover-riding   imperial  legislative  powers   to   be\r\n\r\nexercised,  not on the recommendation of the  Defence\r\n\r\nand  Security  Council, as they say  in  their  White\r\n\r\nPaper,   Sir,   and   say  erroneously,   but   after\r\n\r\nconsidering a report of that Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your delegation asked for a definition of \"external\r\n\r\ndefence\" and \"foreign affairs\" which the Secretary of\r\n\r\nState was peppering the conference with, and finally,\r\n\r\nwe  got that written definition - a definition at  page\r\n\r\n52 - which  I  hope  every public-minded  citizen  will\r\n\r\nread,  because a cursory glance even to a  non-lawyer\r\n\r\nwill sufficiently indicate that the powers which they\r\n\r\nsought - these imperial over-riding powers - cover  every\r\n\r\naspect   of  public  life.  Sir,  no  government   of\r\n\r\nSingapore could, under these provisions, be free from\r\n\r\nthe  constant  coercion to comply  with  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment's  directions on internal  policy  if  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government wanted to survive, and there are\r\n\r\ntimes,  Sir, when, in order to have important  social\r\n\r\nlegislation, one seeks to compromise with  one's  own\r\n\r\nconscience  and  to accept these hateful  directions.\r\n\r\nUnder  these  powers, the Singapore Government  would\r\n\r\nnever be free to evolve policies in harmony with  the\r\n\r\npeople's  wishes but must always be looking over  its\r\n\r\nshoulders,   always  fearful   of   the   threat   of\r\n\r\nutilisation of these powers, always\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompromising. By this simple expedient,  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment  hoped  to  have  full  control  over  our\r\n\r\npolitical  life  and  to  slough  off  the  odium  of\r\n\r\ncolonial   rule   on   to  the   wretched   Singapore\r\n\r\nlegislators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of your delegation, Sir, fearing the\r\n\r\ndangers  of a breakdown of the talks, explored  every\r\n\r\navenue  to make the demands of the British Government\r\n\r\nacceptable to the people of Singapore. To  this  end,\r\n\r\nwe  stated we were prepared to accept the over-riding\r\n\r\npowers,  if  subject  to the recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nDefence  and  Security Council of which the  Chairman\r\n\r\nshould be a man appointed by the United Nations. Sir,\r\n\r\nwe argued that since the British Government said. \"We\r\n\r\nneed  these  powers because we need  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nbase.  We  need  Singapore as a base because  of  our\r\n\r\ninternational defence obligations;\" our  answer  was,\r\n\r\n\"In  that  case, why not have as an arbiter a  person\r\n\r\nappointed by this international organisation of which\r\n\r\nyou  are  a  member and which you claim to  respect?\"\r\n\r\nThat suggestion was rejected out of hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many efforts behind the scenes, Sir, to\r\n\r\nseek  a possible solution. Many suggestions were made\r\n\r\nand,  as  a  final offer at the conference table,  we\r\n\r\nagreed that the British Government should have  these\r\n\r\npowers   if  their  exercise  were  subject  to   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of the Defence and Security  Council\r\n\r\nof  which the Chairman was a Malayan appointed by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the Federation. This suggestion  too,\r\n\r\nSir,  met  with  short shrift. I finally  offered  to\r\n\r\naccept  these  powers and a British Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nDefence and Security Council if these powers, but not\r\n\r\nthe   right   to   suspend  the  constitution,   were\r\n\r\nautomatically  to terminate in April 1959.  Sir,  why\r\n\r\nApril 1959? It is because I wanted for the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  a  fixed  date.  I  sought  to  avoid  the\r\n\r\nagitation  which would make for political instability\r\n\r\nand racial antagonism and if I could say, \"People  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, be patient till 1959. There is no need  to\r\n\r\nagitate,\"  they may well have accepted the  position,\r\n\r\nand furthermore, Sir, to the Colonial Office which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfears the threat of Communism - as I fear the threat of\r\n\r\nCommunism - surely it would have been adequate to  have\r\n\r\nthese  powers for three years? Within the next  three\r\n\r\nyears democracy would either have taken firm root  or\r\n\r\nit  would have withered, and if it withers, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nmain  responsibility  is on  the  conscience  of  the\r\n\r\nColonial Office - if it has a conscience. No, Sir, they\r\n\r\nwere  not  prepared to accept April 1959 even  though\r\n\r\nafter  April 1959 they would still have the right  to\r\n\r\nsuspend our constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only say this, Sir, that during those last few\r\n\r\ndays, when we were struggling and wriggling to find a way  for  some  sort  of an honest  constitution,  I\r\n\r\ngained the impression that the British Government and\r\n\r\nthe  Colonial Office were no longer really interested\r\n\r\nin  reaching an agreement with us, and the conduct of\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary of State on the last Saturday  of  the\r\n\r\nconference,  when he arrogantly sought to  bring  the\r\n\r\nconference  to  an abrupt termination, but  confirmed\r\n\r\nthis view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have returned empty-handed to you because we\r\n\r\nwould  not  put our hand to an agreement which  would\r\n\r\nmake of future Singapore governments de facto stooges\r\n\r\nof  His  Excellency the Governor alias His Excellency\r\n\r\nthe High Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there are people in Singapore who are of the\r\n\r\nview  that  it would have been better to  bring  back\r\n\r\nsomething  than  nothing at all - it is  better  for  a\r\n\r\nhungry   man   to  eat  something  than   to   remain\r\n\r\nstarved - but, Sir, I will never offer a hungry  man  a\r\n\r\npoisoned  cake.  It  is better to remain  hungry.  If\r\n\r\nunadulterated, there were some ingredients of a  fine\r\n\r\ncake in the British offer. But in the package form in\r\n\r\nwhich we had to take it or leave it, the constitution\r\n\r\noffered was a dangerously fraudulent one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did the British Government seek to retain\r\n\r\nover-riding imperial legislative powers but they also\r\n\r\nmade  it clear that, in their view, the time was  not\r\n\r\nripe  for  Sir Robert Black to move out of Government\r\n\r\nHouse and for a Malayan to move in. Our anxiety for a\r\n\r\nMalayan Governor-General, Sir, is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  based  on any personal considerations.  Whatever\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties I may have had with His Excellency,\r\n\r\nI have always found him of the utmost courtesy and if\r\n\r\nwe  must  have  a British Governor or a British  High\r\n\r\nCommissioner - call him what you will - we  may  as  well\r\n\r\nhave Sir Robert Black as any other. Our desire for  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  Governor-General, I repeat, is not based  on\r\n\r\npersonal considerations but it is to give reality  to\r\n\r\nthe  change of status of the Colony of Singapore, but\r\n\r\nif  there is only to be a change of name, I, for one,\r\n\r\nam   not   interested  whether  they  call  Singapore\r\n\r\n\"Colony\"  or  \"State\", if that means the same  thing,\r\n\r\nand  I  am  not interested in whether they  call  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  \"High Commissioner\" or \"Czar\" or \"Fuehrer\",\r\n\r\nif that means the same thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colonial Office also made it clear that, for the\r\n\r\nforeseeable future, Singapore would remain under  the\r\n\r\ntender  care  of that dedicated band of  men  in  the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office  who  have  been  matured   in   the\r\n\r\ntraditions  of authoritarian rule over more  than  80\r\n\r\nmillion abject subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 15th of May, Sir, when the conference\r\n\r\nofficially ended, I have thought and re-thought  over\r\n\r\nmany aspects of it and particularly my repugnance  to\r\n\r\nthe  over-riding imperial legislative powers  and  of\r\n\r\nthe British offer as it was ultimately put before us,\r\n\r\nand  I say to you, Sir, to hon. Members here, and  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore, that I  believe  we  were\r\n\r\nabsolutely    right   in   refusing   a    fraudulent\r\n\r\nconstitution which sought to take away with one  hand\r\n\r\neven  more than what it gave with the other, because,\r\n\r\nSir,  it would have retained complete control but  at\r\n\r\nthe  same time it would have hidden behind the  local\r\n\r\npeople, and colonial interference would not have been\r\n\r\nobvious  and the local people would have carried  the\r\n\r\nodium of Colonial Office policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that it is better to come back empty-handed,\r\n\r\nSir, and still have hope that reason and justice  and\r\n\r\ngood sense will somehow shortly prevail than to tie\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore hand and foot  for  several\r\n\r\nyears  to a constitution which they will have  learnt\r\n\r\nto  revile. To have accepted this constitution  would\r\n\r\nhave  dealt a death blow to the concept of  democracy\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been gaining ground in Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\npast year's rapidly maturing political atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I come to a lighter side. Though the\r\n\r\ncourse  of the constitutional conference was  fraught\r\n\r\nwith  frustrations, I would like to pay public thanks\r\n\r\nfor  the  courtesy  and generous hospitality  of  the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of  State and the British  Government,  as\r\n\r\nwell    as   the   innumerable   organisations    and\r\n\r\nindividuals,  to  the Singapore  delegation  and  its\r\n\r\nindividual  members, and I know that all  members  of\r\n\r\nthe  delegation, and I hope Members of this House and\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  this  country,  would  wish  to   be\r\n\r\nassociated  with  the expression of appreciation  for\r\n\r\nthe   way  in  which  the  Singapore  delegation  was\r\n\r\nreceived by the people and the Government of Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to express my sincere thanks and\r\n\r\nthat   of   the   delegation   to   the   very   able\r\n\r\nconstitutional advisers for their magnificent support\r\n\r\nand  also, Sir, if I may, our sincere thanks  to  our\r\n\r\ndevoted Secretariat from Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last word, Sir, and one which I may expand in\r\n\r\nthe  next  motion and that is: what of the future?  I\r\n\r\nmyself can see no worthwhile prospects except on  the\r\n\r\nroad  on  which  we have just met a serious  setback.\r\n\r\nBiased  though  I  may  be, I  have  sought,  in  all\r\n\r\nhonesty, to assess impartially the true prospects for\r\n\r\nthe welfare of the people of Singapore in the days to\r\n\r\ncome  and  I  repeat that, in my view, our  long-term\r\n\r\nwelfare requires close and friendly co-operation with\r\n\r\nBritain  within the Commonwealth's framework. However\r\n\r\nbitter  the  ashes of our dead hopes, I say  that  we\r\n\r\nmust,  with  Britain, as we are with the  Federation,\r\n\r\nshow our wisdom and our strength by patiently keeping\r\n\r\nthe  door  open  against the  time  when  reason  and\r\n\r\njustice and good sense can prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

They sent  their\r\n\r\ndelegates  to  London  with  a  clear  mandate.   The\r\n\r\nmoderate  claims  put forward by  the  delegation  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  the people of Singapore were rejected  by\r\n\r\nthe  British Government. There is no doubt now in the\r\n\r\nminds  of  the  great  majority  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore that the blame for the failure of the talks\r\n\r\nlies  with the British Government. What was the basic\r\n\r\nreason for the failure of the talks? The basic reason\r\n\r\nwas  the British Government's determination that  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people of Singapore should always be\r\n\r\nsacrificed  to the needs of Singapore as an  imperial\r\n\r\nfortress.  Because of this imperial aim, the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment  refused to grant complete internal  self-government  to  Singapore, including the  control  of\r\n\r\ninternal   security   by  a  democratically   elected\r\n\r\ngovernment  of  the  people of Singapore.  They  even\r\n\r\nrefused to accept a Malayan Chairman for the proposed\r\n\r\nDefence  and  Security Council and thus revealed  the\r\n\r\ninsincerity of their assurance that they desired  the\r\n\r\nunity  of Singapore and the Federation. They insisted\r\n\r\nthat Her Majesty's Government should have over-riding\r\n\r\npowers  to  legislate  by Order  in  Council  and  to\r\n\r\ninstitute  Emergency Regulations through the  British\r\n\r\nHigh  Commissioner, affecting wide fields  of  public life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, what the British Government hoped to do\r\n\r\nwas to take away with one hand what they offered with\r\n\r\nthe other. No self-respecting delegation claiming  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  the  true  interests  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  could have agreed to such conditions.  The\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore can be proud of the rejection  by\r\n\r\nthe   delegation   of  the  offer  of   the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment. By and large, the delegation did not  let\r\n\r\nthe people down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desire of the British Government to preserve\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a fortress even at the cost of  denying\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore their legitimate  political\r\n\r\naspirations   has  earned  for  it   the   odium   of\r\n\r\ninternational  opinion,  and  particularly  of  Asian\r\n\r\nopinion.   This  desire  is  not  only  against   the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people of Singapore but also against\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of  the people of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  It is also offensive to the aspirations  and\r\n\r\npolicies of our great South East Asian neighbours - the\r\n\r\ngreat and peaceful peoples of India, Indonesia, Burma\r\n\r\nand Ceylon. These great neighbours of ours strive  to\r\n\r\ncreate  an  area of peace and democratic progress  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia. They are all therefore  opposed  to\r\n\r\nthe  activities of a S.E.A.T.O. base in this part  of\r\n\r\nthe  world.  A  fortress of colonialism in  Singapore\r\n\r\nsurely  runs  counter  to the  policy  of  the  great\r\n\r\npeoples of India, Indonesia, Burma and Ceylon,  which\r\n\r\nis  to  secure and extend the area of peace in  South\r\n\r\nEast Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lennox-Boyd says that the Singapore fortress is\r\n\r\nnecessary for the defence of the free world. This  is\r\n\r\nstrange,  for India does not want it. Indonesia  does\r\n\r\nnot  want it and neither do Burma and Ceylon  want  a\r\n\r\nS.E.A.T.O, base in this part of the world. For  whose\r\n\r\ndefence  is  it  wanted? Is it  for  the  defence  of\r\n\r\nBritain?  But  Britain is 8,000 miles away.  At  whom\r\n\r\nwill  the  guns  of this fortress be aimed - at  India,\r\n\r\nBurma,  Indonesia,  Ceylon? However,  even  from  the\r\n\r\nmilitary  point  of  view, surely the  hydrogen  bomb\r\n\r\nmakes Singapore useless as a fort. One hydrogen  bomb\r\n\r\non Singapore would spread destruction as far as Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur. In any case, of what use can Singapore be  to\r\n\r\nBritain as a fortress when it is faced with a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopulation  hostile  to  colonialism  and   demanding\r\n\r\nfreedom and democracy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole attitude of the British Government during\r\n\r\nthe talks proved three things. Firstly, it proved the\r\n\r\ninsincerity  of  its  professions  to  grant  genuine\r\n\r\nfreedom and democracy to Singapore. Secondly, by  its\r\n\r\nrejection  of a Malayan Chairman for the Defence  and\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council, it proved the insincerity  of  its\r\n\r\nrepeated  assurance and desire to see  the  unity  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the Federation. Thirdly, the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment sought to continue denying the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  their  aspirations  by  sowing  dissension\r\n\r\namongst them and by trying to throw the blame for the\r\n\r\nfailure of the talks from themselves to other people.\r\n\r\nThis  is  sheer  hypocrisy which all  genuine  anti-colonial parties and groups must expose and condemn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rendel Constitution has been proved unworkable\r\n\r\nand  we  have this now on the authority of no less  a\r\n\r\nperson  than  our distinguished the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister. In the words of the Report on the All-Party\r\n\r\nDelegation to London presented to this Assembly, \"the\r\n\r\nLabour Front-Alliance Government, from the moment  it\r\n\r\ntook  office  on  the  7th  April,  1955,  had  ample\r\n\r\nconfirmation from experience that the diarchical rule\r\n\r\nof  the Rendel Constitution was quite inadequate  for\r\n\r\nthe   happy   evolution  of  the  people's  political\r\n\r\naspirations.\"   The   impossible   nature   of    the\r\n\r\nconstitution   was   again   revealed   during    the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  crisis of June and  July  last  year.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the proved impossibility of  the  Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution, the people of Singapore sent  the  All-Party   Delegation  to  London  to  ask  for  a   new\r\n\r\nconstitution which would give self-government to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. We all know now how these modest\r\n\r\naspirations of the people of Singapore were  treated.\r\n\r\nIn   view  of  this,  this  Assembly  has  no   other\r\n\r\nalternative   but  to  approve  the  stand   of   its\r\n\r\ndelegation at the constitutional conference and, as a\r\n\r\nconsequence, to condemn the insincere attitude of the\r\n\r\nBritish  Government  which was  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nfailure of the talks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Assembly has also no alternative, if it wants\r\n\r\nto  retain the confidence of the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut to instruct any new government that may be formed\r\n\r\nunder  the  present  constitution  that  their   only\r\n\r\njustification  for existence as a government  is  the\r\n\r\nreopening   of   the  constitutional  talks   without\r\n\r\ncompromising  on the important issue of principle  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the talks broke down and towards that end  the\r\n\r\nunity of all genuine anti-colonial parties and groups\r\n\r\nis vital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore have taken the breakdown of\r\n\r\nthe  talks  with great calmness. This is due  to  the\r\n\r\nextreme reasonableness and patience of our people, it\r\n\r\nis  also  due to their continuing confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nleadership of the genuinely anti-colonial parties  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. But the British Government will be  making\r\n\r\na  grave mistake if it takes advantage of the natural\r\n\r\nreasonableness  and  patience  of  our  people.   The\r\n\r\npatience of our people is not unlimited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  when  the  talks were taking place  in  London,\r\n\r\nalmost  everybody in this country anxiously  followed\r\n\r\nthe  progress as reported in the local Press. I, too,\r\n\r\nread my morning papers with great interest and I  had\r\n\r\nhoped that some of the hopes and dreams of our people\r\n\r\nwould  be  achieved peacefully.  I  am  an  old  man,\r\n\r\nprobably one of the oldest men in this House,  and  I\r\n\r\nhad hoped, with thousands of people, that the British\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  be  sincere  to  give   us   self-government   and   independence.  But   the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  not  give  us  independence.   The\r\n\r\nBritish  Government just said that because  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  a  military port and the Parties were not united,\r\n\r\nso they were not willing to grant us independence.  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  is wrong of the British Government  when\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore want independence.  I  would\r\n\r\nsay  that  they just take the people of Singapore  as\r\n\r\ntheir enemies when all we want is friendship with the\r\n\r\nBritish people and the British Government. I think  I\r\n\r\nam   now  mistaken  for  having  thought  that   this\r\n\r\ndelegation would succeed when they went to England to\r\n\r\nask\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  Merdeka. The British have no desire or intention\r\n\r\nto  change their old ways. They live too far away  to\r\n\r\nunderstand Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was young, we never thought of colonialism as\r\n\r\na  bad  thing. We just accepted it; but now everybody\r\n\r\nknows  that  colonialism is really a bad thing.  Even\r\n\r\nthe British are forced to say that colonialism is bad\r\n\r\nnowadays. The reason why the British do not  want  to\r\n\r\ngive  up  Singapore is because the British Government\r\n\r\nare  making  so  much money in Singapore.  They  come\r\n\r\n8,000  miles  away; the climate is not  suitable  for\r\n\r\nthem; and yet, why do they remain here? It is only to\r\n\r\nbring  out the money from Singapore. So they continue\r\n\r\nto rule Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The London talks show us that the British say one\r\n\r\nthing  and do something else. They say all  sorts  of\r\n\r\nsweet  words  to the people and some  of  them  might\r\n\r\nthink  that the British are so good. I say  that  the\r\n\r\ndelegation did a lot in London through the leadership\r\n\r\nof the Hon. the Chief Minister. I say that all credit\r\n\r\nis  due  to  him  for guarding the interests  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Britain wanted to give us something to  show\r\n\r\nthe world that she had given up her bad ways, but she\r\n\r\nwanted  to  take back as soon as she  had  given,  by\r\n\r\nwanting over-riding legislative powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not the end of our fight.

But  for\r\n\r\nmy part, I have learned nothing new this morning from\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Chief Minister's speech. We  have  all\r\n\r\nfollowed  closely every phase of the talks.  We  have\r\n\r\nread  the newspaper comments and we have listened  to\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the  Chief Minister's broadcast.  We  have\r\n\r\nheard it all before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not ordinarily have taken part in this\r\n\r\ndebate but for the fact that I felt that no one  else\r\n\r\nin this Assembly would dare to disagree with the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister on his diatribe of the  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice and, in my opinion, his unseemly criticism  of\r\n\r\nthat  Office. Today's denunciation was an enlargement\r\n\r\nof  the  recent broadcast made by the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  when  he said, \"The Colonial  Office  is  a\r\n\r\nthing apart. The very essence of their philosophy is\r\n\r\nthe  exploitation  of  human  beings.  Theirs  is   a\r\n\r\nphilosophy  of Fascism.\" I think he went  on  to  say\r\n\r\nsomething  that  no amount of written  assurances  or\r\n\r\npromises  could  make the leopard change  his  spots.\r\n\r\nThat  seemed  to  me  to  be a singularly  unpleasant\r\n\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, I do not believe personally that the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office is as all-powerful as the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister suggests. I do not believe that it  is\r\n\r\nan exploiter of human beings, nor do I believe for  a\r\n\r\nmoment  that its policy is Fascist, and  I  am  quite\r\n\r\ncertain  that there must be many people in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwho think in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, to my mind, the whole approach of the\r\n\r\nMerdeka Mission was premature. This is a line I  have\r\n\r\nalways pursued and I will still say it. That many non-Europeans  think  so has also been  revealed  by  the\r\n\r\nvernacular Press round about the time of the  failure\r\n\r\nof  the  Merdeka  talks. The Hon. the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nmade some reference to the English Press this morning\r\n\r\nbut  there was criticism too in the vernacular Press,\r\n\r\nand  if  you  care  to consult the  Public  Relations\r\n\r\nOffice's  translations you will  find  that  this  is\r\n\r\nindeed so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round about May the 19th, there were references in\r\n\r\nthe local Press to the Hon. the Chief Minister having\r\n\r\nspoken  of \"the agony of the people of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nof  the  people being stunned at the failure  of  the\r\n\r\nMerdeka talks\". Well, now, I think, in all sincerity,\r\n\r\nthat  is  an  exaggeration and  indeed  it  would  be\r\n\r\nsurprising  if it were not, because just  before  the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Chief  Minister left, he  himself  made  a\r\n\r\nbroadcast  in which he warned the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nthat  the delegation might not meet with success with\r\n\r\nthe  Colonial  Office and he said, \"If that  happens,\r\n\r\ntake it like men.\" They did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one Chinese newspaper on May the 19th - I hope I\r\n\r\nmay  introduce  these references  to  the  vernacular\r\n\r\nPress  because  we  have heard so  much  against  the\r\n\r\nwicked English Press - said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"it saw the failure of the constitutional talks in\r\n\r\nLondon as a matter of course.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Whatever that may mean - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Do you not know?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I do not read Chinese.

I\r\n\r\nthink it is proper parliamentary practice that if  an\r\n\r\nhon.

The Chung Shing Jit\r\n\r\nPao  in  its  editorial on May the 19th. One  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  it  gave  was that the delegation  was  ill-organised,   its  Members  were  dreaming   different\r\n\r\ndreams,  and  even  attacking and  running  down  one\r\n\r\nanother. The second reason was that, in view  of  the\r\n\r\nstrategic  importance  of  Singapore  as   an   anti-Communist bulwark for the free world, the question of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  independence  is  not  a  local   issue.\r\n\r\nThirdly,  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  failed  to\r\n\r\nrealise that he was dealing with an experienced, far-seeing  Britain who would never submit to tall  talks\r\n\r\nand  threats. In short, the failure of the  talks  is\r\n\r\ndue  to the delegation's lack of political foresight.\r\n\r\nThe  newspaper then urged the Party in power to enter\r\n\r\ninto    further   negotiations   with   the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment, which seems to me very sensible advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, even the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan\r\n\r\nYew), whom this conveyed amusement to, and who in the\r\n\r\npast has always doubted the bona fides of the British\r\n\r\nGovernment, according to the Straits Times,  when  he\r\n\r\nreturned  to  Singapore,  said - of  course,  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  is  free  to correct me if this  is  not  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times, but I copied it out - \"Our  failure  is\r\n\r\nonly  a temporary setback and I do not think anybody,\r\n\r\nleast  of  all the British Government, believes  that\r\n\r\nthis  is anything more than a temporary halt.\" \"least\r\n\r\nof all the British Government !\" - that is pretty good,\r\n\r\ncoming from the Member for Tanjong Pagar!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We are all reasonable people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> He went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"They (the British) are ever anxious to open\r\n\r\nnegotiations with one or more groups from Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And indeed they are, as it says in the final telegram\r\n\r\nto the Hon. the Chief Minister:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We are committed unequivocally to leading the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore to full self-government  within\r\n\r\nthe Commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

This paper, also\r\n\r\nin an editorial at about the same time, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Conditions in Singapore are not suitable for\r\n\r\ncomplete  self-government.  The  experience  of   the\r\n\r\npeople  to  take  over  the responsibilities  of  the\r\n\r\nadministration is very little.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And another one, Sir - I feel like spelling it, but can\r\n\r\nI  pronounce  it  just as I see  it,  Sir - the  Kerala\r\n\r\nBandhu said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It could be deduced from the report of the talks\r\n\r\nthat  the  Colonial Office had acceded to almost  all\r\n\r\nthe  demands of the delegation. Therefore the failure\r\n\r\nof  the  talks can be considered only as a  temporary\r\n\r\nsetback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore should be led by capable leaders who act\r\n\r\nsensibly  and calmly. Experience proves  that  it  is\r\n\r\nfoolish to think of winning over the British lion  by\r\n\r\nfurious and childish threats.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister in his broadcast\r\n\r\nthe  other  evening said that many people wanted  his\r\n\r\nhead.  I  do  not want the Chief Minister's  head.  I\r\n\r\nwould not know what to do with it if I had it, and  I\r\n\r\ndo not disagree with him when he said, \"The people of\r\n\r\nSingapore have as much right to human equality as the\r\n\r\nBritish people.\" But he also said that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis delegation recognised, however, that \"the British\r\n\r\npeople believe that they have strategic interests  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  vital to their survival\" - yes, and  to  his\r\n\r\nand  Singapore's  survival, too. That  is  the  vital\r\n\r\npoint  as  I  see  it.  Britain  has  an  inescapable\r\n\r\ncommitment in this territory to see that this  island\r\n\r\ndoes  not  fall under Communist domination. We  heard\r\n\r\ntoday  all  about Ceylon, India, Burma and  Indonesia\r\n\r\nbut  we  did not hear about the menace to the  north.\r\n\r\nCertain powers are necessary for carrying out defence\r\n\r\nresponsibilities    and   obviously    the    British\r\n\r\nGovernment, and rightly, in my opinion, is not  going\r\n\r\nto relinquish them lightly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister also said, and the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching  Siong)  said\r\n\r\nthis afternoon, that Singapore could be destroyed  by\r\n\r\na  hydrogen  bomb. I think any schoolboy knows  that,\r\n\r\nbut  I would remind these gentlemen that a major  war\r\n\r\nwas  fought in Korea where the Americans had  nuclear\r\n\r\nweapons but did not use them. It does not follow that\r\n\r\natomic  weapons would be used. The British Government\r\n\r\nknows as much about atomic weapons as anybody in this\r\n\r\nHouse - you  can be quite certain about  that  - but  it\r\n\r\nstill  believes that it would be dangerous to  desert\r\n\r\nthis   highly   important  and  strategic   fortress - dangerous  in  the interests of the free  peoples  of\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia as well as their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the Hon. the Chief Minister is a\r\n\r\nMalayan  and  one  thing  I  do  not  doubt  is   his\r\n\r\nsincerity, but when he says that he is right and  Mr\r\n\r\nLennox-Boyd,  the Colonial Office, Sir Anthony  Eden,\r\n\r\nMr Robert Menzies and everybody else are wrong -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Public  opinion\r\n\r\nin  London was that Singapore is not - yet ready  and\r\n\r\nnot    strong   enough   to   shoulder    the    full\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst members of the Liberal-Socialist Party, each\r\n\r\nand everyone of them, in London were doing their very\r\n\r\nbest  to  gain the confidence of the Colonial Office,\r\n\r\nthe  members of the People's Action Party were  doing\r\n\r\ntheir  very worst to harden the minds in the Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such untimely and provocative outcries in\r\n\r\nLondon - \"Drive the white man into the sea!  Drive  the\r\n\r\nBritish    into    the    sea!    Asia    for     the\r\n\r\nAsians!\" - immediately before the opening of the  talks\r\n\r\nhad  certainly paved the way for the failure  of  the\r\n\r\nMerdeka talks. Just ask yourself: would any sane man,\r\n\r\nseeking  a favour, tell his would-be benefactor  that\r\n\r\nhe  intends to get rid of him soon and yet  be  crazy\r\n\r\nenough to expect and to believe that the favour  will\r\n\r\nbe  granted? So unfortunately for us, even before the\r\n\r\ntalks  began,  public opinion in  London  was  biased\r\n\r\nagainst us. Now, let us come to the point - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

Blinded  by\r\n\r\nhis  uncontrollable self-imagined disappointment  and\r\n\r\nrage, the Hon. the Chief Minister could not see\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  way  to  accept  Britain's  offer  of  what  was\r\n\r\ntantamount to full internal self-government which, in\r\n\r\nthe  first  place, he had asked for. What over-riding\r\n\r\npowers  Britain  asked for was to be  tempered  by  a\r\n\r\nrider  in which Britain would undertake by a  written\r\n\r\nguarantee not to abuse, and Mr Lennox-Boyd had  said\r\n\r\nthat. It is beyond the understanding of my Party  and\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore why  the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  would insist on throwing away the talks  by\r\n\r\nasking for an imaginary \"full loaf\". We asked  for  a\r\n\r\nfull loaf with certain unpalatable ingredients.., but\r\n\r\nthose   ingredients  are  of  the  Hon. the   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's own making.

Perhaps  that  turnabout  was\r\n\r\nbrought  on  by Britain's acceptance in principle  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's   citizenship   proposals.   Under   this\r\n\r\nagreement,  which  is now lost to  us  for  the  time\r\n\r\nbeing,  a citizenship status would have been created\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  which  would be  the  equal  of  that\r\n\r\nenjoyed  by  other  members of the Commonwealth.  The\r\n\r\ngranting  of  a rightful place in Singapore  for  all\r\n\r\naliens who take an oath of allegiance to this country\r\n\r\nwould  mean  a tremendous increase in the  number  of\r\n\r\nelectors  capable  of thinking for themselves.  Maybe\r\n\r\nthe  People's Action Party are afraid of the  country\r\n\r\nhaving  a  preponderance of thinking  people  on  the\r\n\r\nrolls. Afterthoughts are often terrifying and we  now\r\n\r\ncan  see  the fears of those bent on playing  to  the\r\n\r\ngallery.

On such an occasion,  we\r\n\r\nlike  to forget all those personal differences  which\r\n\r\nhave   divided  us  and  all  the  other   unpleasant\r\n\r\ndifficulties   which   have  often   bedevilled   our\r\n\r\nrelations in the past term.

I would not myself be so unkind as the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Chief  Minister was to  have  quoted  with\r\n\r\nrelentless    vindictiveness   every    contradictory\r\n\r\nstatement made by high-ranking British Ministers  and\r\n\r\neven  more  high-ranking Commonwealth statesmen.  But\r\n\r\none  thing  sticks out a mile, and that is  that  the\r\n\r\nBritain we went to negotiate with in April this  year\r\n\r\nwas  a  Britain which was in no mood for dynamic  and\r\n\r\nimaginative colonial policies. After the slap in  the\r\n\r\nface  from Jordan, when they kicked out the Chief  of\r\n\r\nthe  Arab  Legion,  after  the  outburst  in  Nicosia\r\n\r\nairfield  the day following a statement from  a  high-ranking British official that they could hold Cyprus,\r\n\r\nwhether  the  people  of  Cyprus  were  friendly   or\r\n\r\nunfriendly,  and after the failure of British  policy\r\n\r\nin  Ceylon  by  the  Left  Wing  election  success - of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the Prime Minister is now being  invited  to\r\n\r\nChequers because he wants to drive the British  bases\r\n\r\ninto  the  sea - we  arrived, as the Member  for  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru  (Mr William Tan) had said, to face a  hostile\r\n\r\nEnglish Press. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  made a collection of these little articles  and\r\n\r\nstories  meant for British consumption and,  at  some\r\n\r\nsuitable date, I think the people of Singapore should\r\n\r\nbe  told  that  what  their  statesmen  and  visiting\r\n\r\ndignitaries tell us is not what the people in England\r\n\r\nare being told.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we flew into London Airport, I was reading the\r\n\r\nDaily  Mail, and the editorial, I think,  struck  the\r\n\r\nkeynote to the talks. On the front page it said:  \"We\r\n\r\nown  Singapore. Let us have none of this nonsense  of\r\n\r\nself-government.  Here is a territory  which,  unlike\r\n\r\nany  other  colonial  territory,  we  bought  and  we\r\n\r\ndeveloped. Who are these little men who now come  and\r\n\r\nsay  that  they want the country from  us?  They  are\r\n\r\nimmigrants. They came here after Britain  bought  the\r\n\r\nplace  and  we  bought  it for ever.\"  That  was  the\r\n\r\nkeynote of British public opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are always a reasonable people, particularly when\r\n\r\nwe  want  to  negotiate. Whatever may have  been  the\r\n\r\nfailings  of  my Party, I think nobody can  say  that\r\n\r\nduring  the  course  of  the talks,  the  P.A.P. was\r\n\r\nunreasonable.  We were prepared to negotiate  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of the agreements arrived at between  all  the\r\n\r\nParties  before  we left Singapore. So  long  as  the\r\n\r\nprinciples  agreed  upon  were  maintained,  we  were\r\n\r\nprepared  to  be  quite  elastic  in  the  forms  and\r\n\r\nultimate  formulae of the final agreement.  Far  from\r\n\r\nhardening  British opinion, as the Member  for  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru  said, we, and a few Members on the  Government\r\n\r\nside, were the only people who took advantage of  the\r\n\r\nfacilities offered by British organisations, such  as\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Party, the Movement for Colonial Freedom,\r\n\r\nthe  Colonial Fabian Bureau, to try and get our point\r\n\r\nof  view  across.  We did not try to  cheat  them  by\r\n\r\nsaying that we loved them and wanted the British  for\r\n\r\nevermore.  What  we said to them  and  what  we  have\r\n\r\nalready  said  here was that Asia is Asian,  that  we\r\n\r\nwant  to tie up the loose ends neatly and peacefully.\r\n\r\nWe  know  that for the time being all we can  get  is\r\n\r\ncomplete  internal control, and we want it. We  tried\r\n\r\nto  put  across the point of view that,  although  we\r\n\r\nwould do what Ceylon is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoing when we became free and independent, it was  in\r\n\r\nthe best interests of Britain to allow that to happen\r\n\r\npeacefully rather than to have it happen violently. I\r\n\r\nquoted  a  British professor to the British people - of\r\n\r\ncourse, one who was disavowed long ago - who said  that\r\n\r\nthere  were  only  two  ways for revolutions - one  was\r\n\r\nrevolution  by violence, and the other was revolution\r\n\r\nby consent. I exhorted them on innumerable occasions,\r\n\r\nand  I  am  grateful  to  the Independent  Television\r\n\r\nAuthority  for giving us an opportunity to  tell  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Britain that their ultimate interest  lies\r\n\r\nin an Asia which, whilst not subservient, is at least\r\n\r\nuncommitted  in  a  world  clash  of  ideologies.  We\r\n\r\nfailed.   We  failed  because  the  British  Colonial\r\n\r\nSecretary  could not carry his Cabinet,  even  if  he\r\n\r\nwanted  to, and because the Cabinet could  not  carry\r\n\r\nTory  public opinion, even if they wanted to, because\r\n\r\nthe  Tory  Press  and  the whole climate  of  British\r\n\r\npublic  opinion was hostile. It was a  revelation  to\r\n\r\nme. I renewed many old friendships. It was astounding\r\n\r\nto  find  the change of political attitudes.  On  one\r\n\r\noccasion - and this was a fair barometer of the  temper\r\n\r\nof  the British people which we had to face and which\r\n\r\nthe British Government has to pay closer attention to\r\n\r\nthan   the   temper  of  the  people  of  Singapore - a\r\n\r\ncontemporary  of mine for whom once  upon  a  time  I\r\n\r\nworked  in  an election, said to me, \"Of  course,  we\r\n\r\nquite agree that ultimately you ought to be free. But\r\n\r\nif  we  get  pushed out from all our little footholds\r\n\r\nall  over the world, then we find ourselves more  and\r\n\r\nmore helpless without American arms and bases and our\r\n\r\npolicy will be dictated by the Americans. There  must\r\n\r\ncome  a  point of time, and the point has  come  now,\r\n\r\nwhen  we  must say that we intend to assert ourselves\r\n\r\nin  this  world and we intend to stay put.\" That  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  what Mr Lennox-Boyd said to us  across  the\r\n\r\nconference table, but there was nothing which he said\r\n\r\nacross  the conference table, particularly after  the\r\n\r\nbreakdown  of  the talks when I tried to  pursue  the\r\n\r\nreasons  why  he  had  refused  our  proposal  for  a\r\n\r\nFederation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChairman,  that contradicts my personal feel  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation,  namely, that Britain was not prepared  to\r\n\r\ngo  any  further with this policy of freeing  subject\r\n\r\npeoples  in  order  that they be  friends  with  her.\r\n\r\nBritain  did  not  believe it  any  more,  not  after\r\n\r\nCeylon. Britain was going to make quite sure, whether\r\n\r\nsubject peoples were friendly or unfriendly, that  as\r\n\r\nlong  as  the reality of power was with Britain,  she\r\n\r\nwas going to have her way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an experience not easily to be forgotten - to\r\n\r\ngo  to these talks with a suave, polished, and a very\r\n\r\nmuch  upper-upper class gentleman, putting  across  a\r\n\r\nvery  British  point  of view, extremely  polite  but\r\n\r\nextremely  ruthless. He told our Chief Minister,  and\r\n\r\nonly  once,  in the crudest possible terms,  what  he\r\n\r\nthought   of  the  aspirations  of  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Much as I admired the polished  sharpness\r\n\r\nof his barbed sarcasm, I left the conference table on\r\n\r\nthe 15th May determined that one day we shall go back\r\n\r\nto  that  conference table and, from  a  position  of\r\n\r\nstrength, re-pay him the courtesies that he  rendered\r\n\r\nus  on  this last occasion, in as polite  and  in,  I\r\n\r\nhope, as refined and genteel a manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are grateful for the little hospitalities of life\r\n\r\nwhich  were accorded us - some of us enjoyed  it  more\r\n\r\nthan  others. In fact, some have not as yet  returned\r\n\r\nfrom  their  journeys.  A Negro  friend  of  mine  in\r\n\r\nLondon,  who,  for the last twenty  years,  has  been\r\n\r\nmeeting  colonial delegations, came up to me one  day\r\n\r\nand presented me with a book about a revolution in an\r\n\r\nAfrican colony and he said, \"Of course, you know, the\r\n\r\nBritish  have been doing this thing for such  a  long\r\n\r\ntime.  They will wrap you up and bathe you in a  warm\r\n\r\nglow of hospitality and hope that in the process  you\r\n\r\nwill  forget all about the chaps you are coming  over\r\n\r\nto fight for, and you will sign anything after that.\"\r\n\r\nI  am  glad to say that the Singapore delegation,  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  the  very  warm glow  of  hospitality  and\r\n\r\nfriendliness  and personal courtesies  which  we  all\r\n\r\nenjoyed, decided that principles were principles, and\r\n\r\nwhen  it  came  to the question of whether  Britain's\r\n\r\ninterest was paramount or the people of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore's interest was paramount, they decided that\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the people of Singapore was the last\r\n\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the talks break down? We had gone there and\r\n\r\nwe  had said beforehand that we would give up foreign\r\n\r\naffairs  and external defence. I would not have  done\r\n\r\nit  that way myself because I never believed that the\r\n\r\nBritish  people,  being some of the most  hard-headed\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  in  the  world, would  take  that  as  a\r\n\r\ngenerous opening gambit and reply, \"You can have  the\r\n\r\nrest.\"  However, after three weeks of  beating  about\r\n\r\nthe  bush,  we  came down to brass  tacks.  What  the\r\n\r\nBritish really want is to make quite sure that  while\r\n\r\nthey  allow  all  the  trappings  of  internal  self-government,  the  reality of power  was  to  be  with\r\n\r\nBritain.  From  Governor  to High  Commissioner,  the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of the three ex-officio Members  and  the\r\n\r\nNominated  Members, and doubling the  number  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly - al1  the velvet glove. In  fact,  they  were\r\n\r\neven prepared to give us international, cultural  and\r\n\r\ntrade  relations which, although it  might  not  have\r\n\r\nallowed  us  a seat in the United Nations,  might  at\r\n\r\nleast  have  allowed  us  to maintain  some  sort  of\r\n\r\nconsular  service. But the reality of power - the  last\r\n\r\nword was to be with their Chairman on the Defence and\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council. Mr Lennox-Boyd - I have  a  healthy\r\n\r\nrespect for the gentleman's dialectical skill - put  it\r\n\r\nover to the British public in an extremely simple and\r\n\r\neffective way. He said, \"The people of Singapore  had\r\n\r\ncome  and  said  beforehand that they would  give  us\r\n\r\ndefence and external affairs. If they give us defence\r\n\r\nand  external  affairs, we must have the chairmanship\r\n\r\nof   the  Defence  and  Security  Council.  This   is\r\n\r\neminently reasonable, and the people of Singapore  or\r\n\r\nthe   delegation   were  eminently  unreasonable   in\r\n\r\nrefusing  us  the  chairmanship of  the  Defence  and\r\n\r\nSecurity Council. Therefore the talks broke down.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the point the talks broke down on the 15th\r\n\r\nof  May this year, I have not the slightest doubt  in\r\n\r\nmy mind that the final decision, to stand firm on our\r\n\r\nproposal of a Malayan Chairman, was right. A  lot  of\r\n\r\nwater has flowed under\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  bridge  since that evening. The Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister will forgive me if, in what is after all  an\r\n\r\nend of term sitting, I were to recall the evening  at\r\n\r\nthe  Independent Television Authority when he  and  I\r\n\r\nboth sloshed up Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd. I must say that\r\n\r\nthe   asperity  of  his  tone  then  was   completely\r\n\r\nunadulterated by any thought of trying somehow or the\r\n\r\nother  to  retrieve the position for the British.  He\r\n\r\nstated  our  stand  then and he  stated  it  in  more\r\n\r\npicturesque   language  than  I  ever  can - \"Christmas\r\n\r\npudding  and arsenic sauce\" - and as we went  down  the\r\n\r\nlift,  he turned around to me and asked me,  \"We  did\r\n\r\nright,  did we not?\" I said to him then and I say  to\r\n\r\nhim  now,  \"We  did  right. We could  not  have  done\r\n\r\notherwise.\"  However  much  we  may  have  wanted  to\r\n\r\nsettle, the moment we found ourselves in that  corner\r\n\r\nwhere  Britain  said, \"You have three representatives\r\n\r\non the Defence and Security Council and I have three.\r\n\r\nThen  I  have  the Chairman and the Chairman  with  a\r\n\r\ndecisive vote. The Council can then recommend to me\r\n\r\nin  London  that  certain  laws  and  Ordinances  are\r\n\r\nnecessary  and I can promulgate them\",  then  we  are\r\n\r\nalready  in  a position where compromise  would  mean\r\n\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think anybody who really sits down to weigh\r\n\r\nup  the  political future would doubt  that,  on  the\r\n\r\nwhole, the conference was not a failure. It was not a\r\n\r\nwaste of time because it brought out the issues  into\r\n\r\nsharper   and  more  immediate  conflict   than   any\r\n\r\ncorrespondence would have done. When  we  faced  each\r\n\r\nother across the table, despite all the gentility  of\r\n\r\ngood  breeding and good manners, we came down to rock\r\n\r\nbottom,  namely, the desire of the British people  as\r\n\r\ninterpreted by the Tory Government to maintain - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The Colonial Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Colonial Office? I make no distinction, Sir. Perhaps there is, but to\r\n\r\nmy  mind,  the  British Government runs the  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice,  the  British Government runs  the  whole  of\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The Cabinet accepted responsibility  for\r\n\r\nthis particular step\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  they were convinced that their duty to  this\r\n\r\ngeneration  and succeeding generations of Britishers,\r\n\r\nlet alone these natives in far away Singapore, was to\r\n\r\nsee  that Britain did not throw her possessions away.\r\n\r\n\"Look  at Ceylon. We were kind to them. We gave  them\r\n\r\nfreedom.  They never had to organise any E.O.K.A, or\r\n\r\n'Join  Greece'  organisation  and  the  silly  cussed\r\n\r\nlittle brown men threw out all their friendly leaders\r\n\r\nand  put  in  a  lot of silly people  who  wear  this\r\n\r\ncurious  outfit  instead of wearing striped  trousers\r\n\r\nand tails and come round to tell us that they want to\r\n\r\nkick  us  out of Trincomalee. We then have to  invite\r\n\r\nthem to come to Chequers as we need them. And we  are\r\n\r\nnot  sure  yet  that when they come to Chequers  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  reasonable because even before  they  leave\r\n\r\nColombo  they  say that they are only going  to  talk\r\n\r\nabout  the procedure of how to get us out of Ceylon.\"\r\n\r\nBasically,  that  was  the attitude  of  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment. I agree with the Hon. the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nthat,  whatever  the  many  differences  within   the\r\n\r\ndelegation, they were all within the confines of  our\r\n\r\ndelegation.   Even  if  we  had  the  most   absolute\r\n\r\nunanimity  we still would have failed. There  was  no\r\n\r\nescape,  in the end, from the irresistible conclusion\r\n\r\nthat  Britain had decided that from now  onwards,  at\r\n\r\nleast as long as this present Government is in power,\r\n\r\nshe  was  going to stand firm on British  rights.  To\r\n\r\nsuggest,  as the Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr  William\r\n\r\nTan)  suggested,  that if we were  only  a  bit  more\r\n\r\nfriendly  we  might  have got somewhere,  is  wishful\r\n\r\nthinking.  However friendly we could have  been,  and\r\n\r\nhowever polite and accommodating, British policy  had\r\n\r\nalready hardened before we arrived in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what was the thing which made the Federation\r\n\r\ntalks  more  successful than the Singapore  talks?  I\r\n\r\nhave  never  really  believed that  sweet  words  and\r\n\r\nreasonableness  alone would get us  freedom.  I  have\r\n\r\nalways  believed that the British are  a  reasonable,\r\n\r\npractical people and that they take a certain  course\r\n\r\nof action because, for the time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing, it is the best course that they can take. When\r\n\r\nconfronted  with  two unpleasant  alternatives,  they\r\n\r\nhave  the knack of choosing the less unpleasant  one.\r\n\r\nIn the Federation they were faced, when the Tunku and\r\n\r\nhis   delegation  went  there,  with  the  unpleasant\r\n\r\nalternative  of saying \"No\" to a mass movement  which\r\n\r\nwas basically non-Communist, and running the risk  of\r\n\r\nhaving that non-Communist movement coalesce with  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  movement, which would have been fatal  for\r\n\r\nBritain.  Faced  with that alternative,  the  British\r\n\r\nsaid  to  the Tunku and his delegates, \"You can  have\r\n\r\nMerdeka by August 1957, if possible.\" If August  1957\r\n\r\ncomes  and  it  is  not  possible  and  that  massive\r\n\r\nnationalist movement is still there and ready to make\r\n\r\nit  unpleasant, not in a violent way, but in a  quiet\r\n\r\nconstitutional way, then Britain will say,  \"Yes,  it\r\n\r\nis  possible.\" That is the task that faces us  today.\r\n\r\nIf  we  had gone to London and (however disunited  we\r\n\r\nwere)  we  represented  a  movement  basically   non-Communist, then I say we would have succeeded. It was\r\n\r\nnot  because we did not have sufficient skill or tact\r\n\r\nor  persuasive powers but because basically we  could\r\n\r\nnot   confront   Britain  with  a   less   unpleasant\r\n\r\nalternative  than the Malayan Communist Party  taking\r\n\r\nover by violent revolution. That is the task which we\r\n\r\nhave before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said when I returned that the British would always\r\n\r\nbe  ready  to open new negotiations, and indeed  they\r\n\r\nare.  They are looking for a stooge group to sign  an\r\n\r\nagreement  with  them. The duty  here  of  all  anti-colonial  parties is to see that no stooge  group  is\r\n\r\nformed  to  sign  this agreement. I  think  we  shall\r\n\r\nsucceed  because when you rub an Asian down  to  rock\r\n\r\nbottom, he gathers together and says, \"Down with  the\r\n\r\nwhite man.\" He said that for hundreds of years and it\r\n\r\ntakes  a  long time to get these things  out  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem,  particularly when the  white  man  is  still\r\n\r\nhere.  That  is the challenge. We must  redouble  our\r\n\r\nefforts.  We  must build up a movement, non-Communist\r\n\r\nbasically,  with a chance, maybe for  all  times  but\r\n\r\nanyway for some time, of running Malaya. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstill believe in one Malaya because we cannot run one\r\n\r\nlittle  colony  or  state  of  Singapore  on  a  non-Communist or any other basis. The moment we have done\r\n\r\nthat,  we  could go back and meet the  Rt.  Hon.  Mr\r\n\r\nLennox-Boyd,  or  whoever his successor  may  be.  We\r\n\r\ncould  then in polite genteel language tell him  that\r\n\r\nthere  would be unfortunate consequences for  British\r\n\r\nprestige,  power, trade and commercial  relationships\r\n\r\nunless  our  fair, modest and reasonable demands  are\r\n\r\ncomplied  with  forthwith. When that moment  arrives,\r\n\r\nthen  we  shall  get Merdeka. That is the  lesson  of\r\n\r\nthese  talks:  that, if we want to succeed,  we  must\r\n\r\nsucceed  on our own strength and not on the  weakness\r\n\r\nof  the  other side. To a certain point, the  British\r\n\r\ncould  be  pushed.  They could be threatened  by  our\r\n\r\nsaying, \"Well, all right, if you will not give it  to\r\n\r\nme,  I will do nothing and I will let something  else\r\n\r\nhappen.\"  As  long as the reality of  power  is  with\r\n\r\nBritain,  she  can  afford to  ignore  that  sort  of\r\n\r\nthreat.  But  when the reality of power shifts  to  a\r\n\r\nnationalist movement, then the British people,  being\r\n\r\neminently  the most reasonable and practical  people,\r\n\r\nwill  be  the first to recognise when it is  time  to\r\n\r\nmake  a graceful exit. That is the task of all  those\r\n\r\nwho  wish  to  see a free, democratic,  non-Communist\r\n\r\nMalaya:  to  build up that movement, so that  however\r\n\r\nweak  and friendly and accommodating our leaders  may\r\n\r\nbe,  there are fierce men behind who will make  clear\r\n\r\nin  no  uncertain terms what the needs and the wishes\r\n\r\nof  the  people are. This is a setback but  it  is  a\r\n\r\ntemporary one because no doors can be closed  to  our\r\n\r\nmovement which is determined to fight on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what the immediate future holds for\r\n\r\nus.  If  the  British through their Governor  are  as\r\n\r\ndemocratic  as they profess to be, then,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  sensible thing would be fresh elections. I  have\r\n\r\nthe  feeling  that they may not be as  democratic  as\r\n\r\nthey  profess themselves to be. Somehow or the  other\r\n\r\nwe  must go on with this Assembly.

You have heard this  morning,\r\n\r\nSir,  how  the  Hon. the Chief Minister  tackled  the\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support heartily the first part of the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's  accusation  that  the  British   Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice  was responsible for the failure of the talks,\r\n\r\nand  I would like to place it on record; but I cannot\r\n\r\nagree with him when he said - I do not know whether  it\r\n\r\nis  because of party politics or whether he tried  to\r\n\r\nbe  diplomatic - that there was unity  in  the  Merdeka\r\n\r\nDelegation. When I think of the disunity  that  there\r\n\r\nwas  in the delegation, I feel disgusted and consider\r\n\r\nit a disgrace. I do not think it is fair of the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister to try to cover this up. There were  reports\r\n\r\nof disunity in the local Press and even in the London\r\n\r\nPress after the arrival of the Merdeka Delegation  in\r\n\r\nLondon. There were charges and counter-charges.  Some\r\n\r\nmembers charged that a certain Party was supported by\r\n\r\nthe Communist Party, which in turn invited the retort\r\n\r\nthat  \"our  leader  is  not an Asian  and  he  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand the Asian nationalist movement.\"  On  many\r\n\r\noccasions,  at  tea  parties  and  public  functions,\r\n\r\nspeeches  were  made  by members  of  the  delegation\r\n\r\nopenly contradicting each other. Members of one Party\r\n\r\nwould  say,  \"My  Party is the best.  The  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore support my Party.\" Then members of  another\r\n\r\nParty  would reply, \"No, the people of Singapore  are\r\n\r\nled  by  us.\"  The Hon. the Chief Minister  tried  to\r\n\r\ncover this up and said that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisunity within the delegation was not known  to  the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office. I think we should not do  that.  We\r\n\r\nmust  tell  the truth that the Colonial  Office  knew\r\n\r\nvery  well  that there were disunity and disagreement\r\n\r\nwithin our delegation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the true state of affairs is known, that\r\n\r\nthere  was  disunity  within  the  delegation,  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  would  naturally  ask,  \"Who  should  be\r\n\r\nblamed for the failure of the Merdeka talks?\" We have\r\n\r\nalready  heard  some  Members say  that  the  British\r\n\r\nColonial Office should be blamed. Others say that the\r\n\r\nHon. the Chief Minister should be blamed. I wish  to\r\n\r\ntell  the  people  of  Singapore the  truth - that  all\r\n\r\nParties  should  be blamed, including myself.  Filthy\r\n\r\nparty  politics and party manoeuvres created disunity\r\n\r\nin the delegation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

Had it not been for a sudden switch  in\r\n\r\nthe  stand of the delegation, I think my proposal  to\r\n\r\naccept  the  Colonial  Office's offer  under  protest\r\n\r\ncould have been carried. With your permission, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwill  quote  extracts from the  Minutes  of  the  8th\r\n\r\nmeeting  of the All-Party Delegation held at No.  10,\r\n\r\nCarlton  House  Terrace, London,  at  12.30  p.m, on\r\n\r\nMonday, 7th May, 1956:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The meeting then considered the stand to be taken\r\n\r\non  the  statement of the Legislative  Powers  to  be\r\n\r\nretained by Her Majesty's Government as set  out,  in\r\n\r\nthe paper attached to S.C.T. (56) 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee Kuan Yew (the Member for Tanjong Pagar)\r\n\r\nstated  that as he saw it these proposals forced  the\r\n\r\nDelegation  to  return  to  the  realities   of   the\r\n\r\nsituation. It was clear that Her Majesty's Government\r\n\r\nwould  continue to remain in Singapore by  virtue  of\r\n\r\nforce. The Delegation had therefore to condition  its\r\n\r\napproach to meet that situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. view was to ask for internal self-government. Having conceded external defence and\r\n\r\nexternal  affairs the sovereignty remained  with  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His (Mr Lee Kuan Yew's) view was that if the\r\n\r\nconstitution  provided for complete  control  of  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Service and internal security, that should  be\r\n\r\nacceptable.  His  stand all  along  had  been  for  a\r\n\r\nconstitutional settlement. His attitude had  been  to\r\n\r\nfind  out  how  much they could get, and  if  it  was\r\n\r\npolitically  acceptable, then the  Delegation  should\r\n\r\ntake\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister asked for confirmation that he\r\n\r\ncorrectly understood that the P.A.P. stand  was  that\r\n\r\nif  Singapore could get complete control of the Civil\r\n\r\nService  and the Police they were prepared  to  allow\r\n\r\nlegislative  powers  to  be  in  the  hands  of   Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then the Member for Tanjong Pagar confirmed that that\r\n\r\nwas  the position - that if we got Malayanisation,  if\r\n\r\nwe  could  get control of the Police Force, we  could\r\n\r\nallow   Her   Majesty's  Government   to   have   the\r\n\r\nlegislative powers. Of course, to be fair,  he  added\r\n\r\nmore:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\". . . if Singapore had control of the Police\r\n\r\nforce  and  the Civil Service, it could in 18  months\r\n\r\norganise  itself so that the British could be  thrown\r\n\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this any different from my last proposal - that we\r\n\r\ncould return and ask for more powers in two years? So\r\n\r\nthat  was  the P.A.P. stand on the 7th of  May.  Were\r\n\r\nthey  not  prepared  to accept the Colonial  Office's\r\n\r\noffer?  Even  if  I  can tell you off  the  record - [Interruption.] This is what the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  said  to the Hon. the Chief Minister:  \"David,\r\n\r\nwhy do we want to fool ourselves and fool the people?\r\n\r\nIf we allow Her Majesty's Government full legislative\r\n\r\npowers  to suspend the constitution, why cannot  they\r\n\r\nmake a partial suspension? It is just like offering a\r\n\r\nperson  four tyres. Can you stop him using  only  one\r\n\r\ntyre?\"  That was the actual position and hon. Members\r\n\r\ncan  check  me if I am wrong. That was the  practical\r\n\r\nexample that the Member for Tanjong Pagar put forward\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the head of the delegation - that we could allow Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government to have a partial suspension  of\r\n\r\nour   constitution.   That  was   the   controversial\r\n\r\nproblem - over-riding powers over our Legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the question of citizenship which was\r\n\r\none  of  the  subjects discussed at the  delegation's\r\n\r\nmeetings.  This subject has been going on  for  many,\r\n\r\nmany  years. Before our departure for London, we  had\r\n\r\nan  agreement that the question of citizenship should\r\n\r\nbe  included  in the talks, but when  it  arose,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Ulu  Bedok (Inche Abdul Hamid  Bin  Haji\r\n\r\nJumat),  representing the U.M.N.O., strongly  opposed\r\n\r\nraising  it for discussion. Imagine my surprise  when\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  stated  that   \"he\r\n\r\nsupported  U.M.N.O.'s stand on this  and  added  that\r\n\r\nthis  was  a purely domestic affair which should  not\r\n\r\naffect  the  negotiations.\"  To  make  it  clear,  he\r\n\r\nemphasised that \"This is a minor and domestic  issue.\r\n\r\nDo  not  discuss it at this meeting.\" Sir,  on, this\r\n\r\npoint - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

In  view  of  the  Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar's  stand  on it at the meetings  in  London,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask him this: Is he afraid of  letting\r\n\r\nthis  question of citizenship go through, which  will\r\n\r\nmean that there will be added to the electoral roll a\r\n\r\nquarter  of  a million middle-aged and stable  voters,\r\n\r\nand  that  he  has  no confidence  in  winning  their\r\n\r\nsupport?  That  if  citizenship  goes  through,   his\r\n\r\nelection  machinery is not going to run  smoothly?  I\r\n\r\nhope  not, but there is a doubt in my mind and I like\r\n\r\nto  be  sure, because suddenly the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  changed  his  attitude on  this  question  and\r\n\r\nbecame  so firm and would not want any compromise  at\r\n\r\nall. I say that only the Hon. the Chief Minister  was\r\n\r\nthe  one  who, from beginning to end, wanted a  whole\r\n\r\nloaf  of bread, but not the Member for Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\nBut we are now back in Singapore and the local people\r\n\r\nthink  that  he  was the only person who  stood  firm\r\n\r\nthroughout the Merdeka talks, the only hero!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Next to the Member for Changi!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am not like that.

But  I would like to point out what the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  has  pointed  out.  There  are  many,  many\r\n\r\npolitical Parties - too many, in fact - in such  a  small\r\n\r\nisland as Singapore with such a small population, and\r\n\r\nour   people  are  divided.

Steps that are being taken to encourage the establishment of new industries include the setting aside of areas for industrial development, notably at Toa Payoh and possibly later at Tanjong Beylaya, and proposals for the establishment of an Industrial Promotions Board to assist small-scale manufacturers and for making sites available through the Singapore Improvement Trust on reasonable terms. The possibility of reducing the cost of water supplied to industrial users is being discussed with the City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary inquiries are dealt with by the Development Section of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry which will shortly be strengthened by the appointment of an Industrial and Commercial Intelligence Officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exact figures relating to factories newly opened in 1956 are not available but it is known that the undermentioned factories amounting to 27 in all have been opened since January of this year.

These measures are: - \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to expand the administration and the inspectorate to ensure that grants-in-aid are well spent and properly accounted for;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to assess teachers' qualifications and service not previously recognised;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to draft a new Education Ordinance and Grant Code and Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the requests from some Chinese Schools for ad hoc building grants are being considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time committees are working on the revision of syllabuses and text-books for all subjects, including Civics, and on the provision of religious or ethical instruction in all schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration is also being given to the composition of the new Educational Advisory Council, which will be formally constituted under the new Education Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evening classes for pupils who failed to gain admission to secondary schools have already started. There are now 11 classes with some 400 pupils, and the system can be greatly extended if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General development plans which have just been prepared include the building of enough primary schools to ensure that no child need leave school till he is 14; of some 4 secondary schools a year to include academic, technical and trade schools for pupils from all types of primary school; of a new Teachers' Training College similar to the Paterson Road College; and of the Polytechnic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These development plans, if fully carried out, would involve a capital expenditure over the next 5 years of some $70 million and an annual recurrent expenditure rising over the same period to over $100 million.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it should be clearly understood that this programme can only be carried out in full -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if the necessary teachers can be recruited, trained and retained;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if enough suitable sites can be acquired and cleared;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) if the work is within the Colony's building capacity; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) if Government can provide the necessary funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost to Government will also depend on how many Chinese schools are to receive full grant-in-aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INCREASED STAFF, BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT REQUIRED AND EXPENDITURE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INVOLVED FOR THE OPERATION OF DISTRICT COUNCILS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing whether he will give details of the increased staff, buildings and equipment which will be required, together with estimates of the capital and annual recurring expenditure involved, for operating four District Councils which the Committee on Local Government has recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> A White Paper outlining the Government's policy with regard to the Report of the Committee on Local Government is being tabled before the Assembly.
