Of the seven fatal accident cases,\r\n\r\none  involved a member of the S.A.F, and the others\r\n\r\nwere  all  civilians. The six cases  involving  the\r\n\r\ncivilians are still pending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation paid out for loss of life, injuries\r\n\r\nand  damage to vehicles for the period in  question\r\n\r\namounts to $68,683.94 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the accident rate is deplorably high, about three times that of British Army vehicles in Singapore. There are many reasons for the poor performance of S.A.F, drivers. Among them are lack of experience, inadequate training and low levels of discipline in some instances. There is\r\n\r\nclear  evidence from Unit records of  mileages  and\r\n\r\naccidents  that  combat units  have  a  much  lower\r\n\r\naccident  rate than P.D.F., Logistics  and  Service\r\n\r\nUnits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these reasons stem from one basic cause, and\r\n\r\nthat  is  the inordinately rapid expansion  of  the\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces  which we had to bring about  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  two  years. This had resulted  in  a  greatly\r\n\r\nincreased demand for transport. It was difficult to\r\n\r\nmeet  this  demand and, at the same time,  maintain\r\n\r\nhigh standards of driving. The problem is a serious\r\n\r\none  and  I am paying personal attention to  it.  I\r\n\r\ndiscussed  the subject at a meeting with  all  Unit\r\n\r\nCommanders held on 17th of September this  year.  A\r\n\r\nnumber  of measures have been introduced to improve\r\n\r\ndriving discipline, to raise training standards and\r\n\r\nto reduce pressure of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the difficulty here is that punishment\r\n\r\nfor  offences  committed by  military  drivers  has\r\n\r\nhitherto  been  dealt with in the civilian  courts.\r\n\r\nCases  are  heard after a long interval  and  quite\r\n\r\noften  the  penalty imposed by our  magistrates  is\r\n\r\nvery  light. For instance, an offence committed  in\r\n\r\nDecember last year was dealt with last week and the\r\n\r\ndriver was fined $45.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the agreement of the civil authorities, it\r\n\r\nis  now proposed to deal with these offences  under\r\n\r\nmilitary   discipline.  Henceforth,  all   military\r\n\r\ndrivers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  accidents will be placed  immediately\r\n\r\nunder  open arrest, unless it is self-evident  from\r\n\r\nthe  nature  of the accident that the  drivers  are\r\n\r\nblameless.  The military and civilian  police  have\r\n\r\nagreed  to  co-operate to make  evidence  available\r\n\r\nwith  minimum delay. Drivers will be tried  not  by\r\n\r\nCompany Commanders but by Unit Commanders who  have\r\n\r\nwider  powers  of punishment. A standard  scale  of\r\n\r\npunishment is being worked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the increased demand for drivers, the\r\n\r\nperiod  of  training had to be reduced  from  eight\r\n\r\nweeks  to  six  weeks.  I have  directed  that  the\r\n\r\ntraining period revert to eight weeks. Further, the\r\n\r\nnumber  of trainees will be determined not  by  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for transport by units in the Army  but  by\r\n\r\nthe  training capacity of the driving school.  Even\r\n\r\non  conclusion  of  eight weeks'  training,  it  is\r\n\r\nincumbent on Unit Commanders to nurse these drivers\r\n\r\nand  provide  them  with  additional  guidance  and\r\n\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of duty hours of vehicle drivers is\r\n\r\nalso being examined. It is not always the case that\r\n\r\ndrivers  are to blame. For instance, in an accident\r\n\r\nlast  month which received widespread publicity  in\r\n\r\nthe press, when an Army truck went off the road  at\r\n\r\nDevil's Bend in Thomson Road, it was found that the\r\n\r\ndriver had been on duty for 19\u00ab hours at a stretch.\r\n\r\nIt  is obviously undesirable that drivers should be\r\n\r\nsubjected to such long stretches of duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these and other measures, there\r\n\r\nare  signs  that the accident rate is  going  down.\r\n\r\nBetween January and September this year, there  was\r\n\r\none  accident  for every 9,600 miles  travelled  by\r\n\r\nS.A.F, vehicles. Between October 1st and 15th,  the\r\n\r\naccident  rate  was one accident for  every  12,700\r\n\r\nmiles,  It  is still too early to say whether  this\r\n\r\nrepresents a real improvement which will  continue,\r\n\r\nbut  I  am optimistic that if we continue  to  take\r\n\r\nresolute  measures,  the standards  of  driving  of\r\n\r\nS.A.F, vehicles  will improve and  accident  rates\r\n\r\nwill go down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is likely that the enforcement of these new\r\n\r\nmeasures  will  result  in temporary  shortages  in\r\n\r\ntransport  for  military units.

Japan  and\r\n\r\nIndia have recently completed the conversion. Among\r\n\r\nSoutheast    Asian   countries,   Indonesia,    the\r\n\r\nPhilippines,  Thailand, Cambodia  and  Vietnam  are\r\n\r\nalready   using  the  metric  system.

Although Singapore's\r\n\r\ntrade with the United States has expanded from  4.7\r\n\r\nper cent of total trade in 1965 to 9.1 per cent  in\r\n\r\n1969,   the   items  likely  to  be   affected   by\r\n\r\nmetrication form only about 12.7 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are obvious advantages of adopting the\r\n\r\nmetric  system. Because it is decimally based,  the\r\n\r\nconversion  from one unit to another requires  only\r\n\r\nthe  shifting  of the decimal place.  Its  inherent\r\n\r\nsimplicity  in  use  will benefit  all  sectors  of\r\n\r\neconomic  activities and the time saved in learning\r\n\r\nother  systems of weights and measures  in  schools\r\n\r\ncould be more profitably spent for other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall cost of conversion in a country\r\n\r\ndepends on the degree of industrialisation, but  if\r\n\r\nconversion is necessary, it should commence as soon\r\n\r\nas possible, as it has been estimated in the United\r\n\r\nKingdom that the costs of conversion increase at  a\r\n\r\nrate  of 8 per cent for every year of delay. It  is\r\n\r\ndifficult   to  quantify  the  overall   costs   of\r\n\r\nconversion,  which should include not  only  direct\r\n\r\ncosts,  but  also costs due to wastage and  initial\r\n\r\nloss in efficiency arising from lack of familiarity\r\n\r\nwith the new system.

For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  India, the cost of converting  petrol\r\n\r\npump  dials to measure in litres turned out  to  be\r\n\r\nonly  one per cent of the original estimate. A very\r\n\r\nrough  estimate  of expenditure to be  incurred  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments and  statutory  bodies  for\r\n\r\nmetrication is $5.6 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore's economy is very much dependent on\r\n\r\ndevelopments outside the country, we must  move  in\r\n\r\nstep  with the metricating world. The rubber  trade\r\n\r\nin Singapore and Malaysia, for example, has decided\r\n\r\nto  metricate with effect from 11th February, 1971,\r\n\r\nfollowing its acceptance of the recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthe  Metrication  Joint Working  Committee  set  up\r\n\r\nrecently by the Rubber Association of Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe   Malaysian  Rubber  Exchange.  The   Singapore\r\n\r\nTelephone  Board has been informed by  a  telephone\r\n\r\ncable supplier in the United Kingdom that new cable\r\n\r\nspecifications in metric units would be adopted  in\r\n\r\nAugust 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is apparent that as time goes on, the market\r\n\r\nfor  goods  with  specifications in imperial  units\r\n\r\nwill  get progressively smaller and those for goods\r\n\r\nin metric units will, ipso facto, get larger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metrication will be introduced by administrative\r\n\r\naction  first  in  the Government  departments  and\r\n\r\nstatutory  bodies.  The  Ministry  of  Science  and\r\n\r\nTechnology  has  made  a  study  of  the  technical\r\n\r\nproblems  involved  in  conversion  to  the  metric\r\n\r\nsystem and the political and economic consequences.\r\n\r\nA report of the study has been tabled in the House.\r\n\r\nChapter   4   summarises  the  findings  concerning\r\n\r\nGovernment   departments  and   statutory   bodies,\r\n\r\nexcluding the Singapore Armed Forces. It  has  been\r\n\r\nfound  that  conversion can  commence  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible in most of the Government departments  and\r\n\r\nstatutory bodies without incurring excessive costs,\r\n\r\nwhich  fall  mainly in the purchase  of  equipment.\r\n\r\nSome Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepartments  and statutory bodies,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nneed  to  metricate irrespective of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment's  decision,  because  of  international\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot introduce metrication in Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  without affecting the private  sector,\r\n\r\nas   members  of  the  public  have  dealings  with\r\n\r\nGovernment departments. The problems of metrication\r\n\r\nin  the private sector are more complex and  it  is\r\n\r\ntherefore intended that a Metrication Board,  which\r\n\r\nwill   consist   of  representatives   of   various\r\n\r\nindustries, will liaise with Government departments\r\n\r\nto  ensure that metrication is introduced gradually\r\n\r\nand  smoothly without dislocation of production and\r\n\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to expect housewives, amahs or\r\n\r\nhawkers to change overnight their familiarity  with\r\n\r\ncustomary units of measures. There must be  a  long\r\n\r\nperiod of propaganda and education to orientate the\r\n\r\npublic  towards the new system. For example,  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  accustomed to taking a pint of  beer  may\r\n\r\nfind  that half a litre is too little while a litre\r\n\r\nis  too much. Market stall-holders used to charging\r\n\r\nprices of meat, chicken and vegetables by the  kati\r\n\r\nwill find that charging by the kilogram will create\r\n\r\nan impression of rising prices, although a kilogram\r\n\r\nis  1.6 katis. The neater way is to use prices  per\r\n\r\nhalf kilogram, but as this is only 82 per cent of a\r\n\r\nkati, prices should be proportionately lowered. The\r\n\r\nmotorist will find that a gallon of petrol can take\r\n\r\nhim  30 miles, but if he buys a litre, it will give\r\n\r\nhim  only  one fifth the distance. Then again,  dua\r\n\r\nbelas batu Bukit Timah in miles is further than dua\r\n\r\nbelas  batu  in  kilometres. This can  confuse  the\r\n\r\npostman  or someone who is trying to find his  way.\r\n\r\nIt is felt, therefore, that the retail trade sector\r\n\r\nshould   be  left  to  metricate  voluntarily   and\r\n\r\ngradually  since this sector involves a  change  of\r\n\r\ningrained and accumulated habits of the majority of\r\n\r\nthe population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no compensation will be paid to the\r\n\r\nprivate   sector   for   costs   arising   out   of\r\n\r\nmetrication. The costs of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconversion will lie where they fall. Conversion  to\r\n\r\nthe  metric system should not be used as a  pretext\r\n\r\nfor price increases or profiteering. Neither should\r\n\r\nmetrication cause the private sector undue or harsh\r\n\r\nfinancial hardships. For these reasons, the process\r\n\r\nof  conversion to the metric system should cover  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of several years, although it is  our  hope\r\n\r\nthat  by 1975 all Government departments and three-quarters of private industries with external  trade\r\n\r\ndealings will have converted to the metric system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there is a large number of statutes in\r\n\r\nSingapore   which  use  imperial   units,   it   is\r\n\r\ncumbersome  to take each statute through Parliament\r\n\r\nfor amendment. A Metrication Bill will therefore be\r\n\r\nintroduced to enable necessary legal changes to  be\r\n\r\nmade  by  Gazette notification without taking  each\r\n\r\nstatute   through   Parliament.  Furthermore,   the\r\n\r\npresent Weights and Measures Ordinance (Cap.  230),\r\n\r\nwhich  only  legalises  the local  (i.e.,  gantang,\r\n\r\nchupak, kati, tahil) and imperial systems,  has  to\r\n\r\nbe  amended  to  include the metric  system.  Units\r\n\r\nbased  on the kilogram, metre and second are  being\r\n\r\nused  in  many of the metric countries and accepted\r\n\r\nby  nearly all the metricating countries. They  are\r\n\r\nreferred  to as the International System  of  Units\r\n\r\nand  will  initially exist side by  side  with  the\r\n\r\nlocal  and imperial systems currently in use. There\r\n\r\nis,  however,  provision in the  proposed  Bill  to\r\n\r\nempower  the  Minister to declare by  notification,\r\n\r\nnot  less  than five years after this Bill  becomes\r\n\r\nlaw, any  unit to be invalid for use in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwith  a  proviso that the Minister can  exempt  any\r\n\r\nperson  or  department from the operation  of  such\r\n\r\nnotification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NATIONAL SERVICE POLICY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by the Minister of Defence)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the\r\n\r\nnormal  course  of events, detailed explanation  of\r\n\r\npolicy  arising out of new legislation is given  at\r\n\r\nthe Second Reading of the Bill, not at the time  of\r\n\r\nits  introduction. In the case of the Bill which  I\r\n\r\nam introducing today,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Enlistment (Amendment) Bill, I will  not  have\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity under Standing Orders  to  make  a\r\n\r\nstatement  at the time of the introduction  of  the\r\n\r\nBill. I am therefore making a Ministerial statement\r\n\r\non  the subject under Standing Order 10. Enlistment\r\n\r\npolicy  has been a subject of heated public  debate\r\n\r\nin recent weeks. The extraordinary thing about this\r\n\r\ndebate  was  that  members of the  Singapore  Armed\r\n\r\nForces  joined in the fray with great zest.  I  can\r\n\r\nonly assume that these soldiers were unaware of the\r\n\r\nexistence   of  Regulation  680  of   the   Queen's\r\n\r\nRegulations.  It  is  hardly possible  under  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances  for the Government to announce  some\r\n\r\nmajor   change  in  enlistment  policy  without   a\r\n\r\ndetailed   explanation  of   its   intentions.   An\r\n\r\nexplanation  is  all  the more necessary  as  there\r\n\r\nseems  to be widespread public misconception  about\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When national service was introduced in 1967, it\r\n\r\nappeared  that  Singapore  could  depend   on   the\r\n\r\nextension of the British military presence until at\r\n\r\nleast  1975. Accordingly, the rate of our  military\r\n\r\nbuild-up   was   planned  at  a  deliberate   pace.\r\n\r\nDeferment  and  exemption from  full-time  national\r\n\r\nservice  were  freely granted. Boys leaving  school\r\n\r\nand   admitted  to  the  University  were   granted\r\n\r\nautomatic  deferment.  Even  those  who   were   in\r\n\r\nemployment  were  exempted from full-time  national\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This liberal policy on exemption or deferment had\r\n\r\nthe   effect  of  restricting  full-time   national\r\n\r\nservice  intakes  mainly  to  boys  in  the   lower\r\n\r\neducational  standards. There  was  a  shortage  of\r\n\r\nofficer material. To make up for this, the Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Defence   recruited  persons  into   full-time\r\n\r\nnational service who entered Government service  or\r\n\r\nthe  service  of statutory authorities even  though\r\n\r\nthey  were  not  of the age groups currently  being\r\n\r\nenlisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When early in 1968 the British announced their\r\n\r\nplan to accelerate the withdrawal of their military\r\n\r\nforces  to he completed by the end of 1971, it  was\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  speed up the build-up of  our  Armed\r\n\r\nForces, in 1968 and 1969,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity graduates were enlisted whether  or  not\r\n\r\nthey  were  recruited  into  the  service  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or the statutory authorities.  However,\r\n\r\nsuch    enlistment    was   selective    and    not\r\n\r\ncomprehensive.  The  policy  of  allowing  boys  to\r\n\r\nproceed  to the University on completion  of  their\r\n\r\nH.S.C, examination continued in these two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1970, my predecessor decided to make a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive review of enlistment policy. By  that\r\n\r\ntime,  expansion of the Armed Forces  was  in  full\r\n\r\nswing,  and  there was need to recruit an  enlarged\r\n\r\nnumber  of  officer material to man  not  only  the\r\n\r\nCombat  Units but also the logistic bases that  had\r\n\r\nto  be established or expanded at great speed. Also\r\n\r\nthere  were  many staff positions  in  the  Defence\r\n\r\nMinistry which had to be filled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major innovation which my predecessor\r\n\r\nintroduced  was  to change the policy  of  granting\r\n\r\nexemption  for  students who  had  completed  their\r\n\r\nH.S.C, examination  and  were  proceeding  to  the\r\n\r\nUniversity.  The decision was made that  for  1970,\r\n\r\nhalf  of these would be enlisted and half deferred.\r\n\r\nThe   basis  for  deferment  in  respect  of  other\r\n\r\ncategories  of  age  registrants  was  examined  in\r\n\r\ndetail   and  rationalised.  Contrary  to   popular\r\n\r\nopinion,  clearly defined rules were laid down  but\r\n\r\nthe details were not then published. The rules were\r\n\r\nimplemented by administrative measures. I am taking\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity today to publish rules that  were\r\n\r\nlaid  down  in  January  1970  by  my  predecessor,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  an  indication whether  they  still\r\n\r\nremain  in  force  or  not.  A  reference  to  this\r\n\r\ndocument(See Annex, cols. 359-68),  which has been circulated  to  Members,\r\n\r\nshows  that  nearly  all the  rules  laid  down  in\r\n\r\nJanuary 1970 remain in force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special arrangements have been made at the two\r\n\r\nUniversities  to  enable H.S.C, students  enlisted\r\n\r\nthis year to enter the University with minimum loss\r\n\r\nof  time. As from next year the university  session\r\n\r\nwill commence in the first week\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof July instead of May. H.S.C, students enlisted in\r\n\r\nJanuary this year and subsequently commissioned  as\r\n\r\nofficers  will  be  allowed  a  break  in  national\r\n\r\nservice  in  July  1972 when  they  will  join  the\r\n\r\nUniversity.   They  will  complete  their   service\r\n\r\nliability,  usually another additional six  months,\r\n\r\nduring   the   University  long  vacation.   H.S.C.\r\n\r\nstudents  enlisted in April will also be  permitted\r\n\r\nto  join the University in July 1972, and they will\r\n\r\ncomplete  their service liability during  two  long\r\n\r\nvacations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the policy introduced in January this year,\r\n\r\nit   was   envisaged   that  progressively   larger\r\n\r\nproportions  of H.S.C, students would  be  enlisted\r\n\r\nbefore  they  join the University. In 1971,  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed to enlist three-quarters of them and defer\r\n\r\none-quarter. By 1973, all H.S.C, students  will  be\r\n\r\nenlisted except for those awarded Colombo Plan  and\r\n\r\nother  overseas scholarships, whose selection rests\r\n\r\nwith  the  Public  Service  Commission.  They  will\r\n\r\ncommence their national service on their due  dates\r\n\r\nbut  will be allowed to proceed overseas when their\r\n\r\nuniversity  term begins. They will  complete  their\r\n\r\nnational service on their return to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the position earlier this year. In\r\n\r\nmaking a further review of enlistment policy, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  take into account two  factors.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  that  the British presence  will  remain\r\n\r\nuntil  at  least 1975. This reduces the urgency  of\r\n\r\nrapid    and   accelerated   expansion.   Secondly,\r\n\r\nprogressively  larger numbers  of  H.S.C, students\r\n\r\nwill be enlisted for full-time service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both these factors reduce the need to enlist\r\n\r\nUniversity   graduates   for   full-time   national\r\n\r\nservice. Sooner or later, a decision must  be  made\r\n\r\non  the liability of University graduates for full-time  national service. The problem is a  difficult\r\n\r\none.  To continue past policies indefinitely  would\r\n\r\nserve  the  interests of equity,  as  much  of  the\r\n\r\ndiscontent  arising  among  graduates  in  national\r\n\r\nservice  is that enlistment had been selective  and\r\n\r\nnot  comprehensive. At the same time, it  is  clear\r\n\r\nthat a decision on liability of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngraduates cannot be deferred for long. I decided to\r\n\r\nexclude  graduates  from the  October  1970  intake\r\n\r\nunless  they  were  of  the age  group  liable  for\r\n\r\nnational  service in any event, that  is,  if  they\r\n\r\nwere born on or after 1st January, 1949. The result\r\n\r\nof   this  decision  has  been  unhappiness   among\r\n\r\ngraduates now serving in the Armed Forces.  I  will\r\n\r\nrefer to this subject later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Enlistment Bill which I will soon be\r\n\r\nintroducing  reduces  the  period  of  service   of\r\n\r\nnational service officers from 3 years to 2 1/2 years.\r\n\r\nIt   increases  the  period  of  service  of   non-commissioned officers, corporals and above, from  2\r\n\r\nyears  to 2 1/2 years. The period of service of  other\r\n\r\nranks remains at 2 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Enlistment Bill will apply to national\r\n\r\nservicemen enlisted as from 1971. It will not apply\r\n\r\nto national servicemen already in the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of the Ministry of Defence to\r\n\r\nenlist  H.S.C, students in the January  and  April\r\n\r\nintakes  in 1971. Those most likely to be  admitted\r\n\r\nto  the  University - this will be judged by  their\r\n\r\nschool   examination  results,  since  the   H.S.C.\r\n\r\nresults  will not be known in time - will be  taken\r\n\r\ninto  the January intake. This will enable them  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  the 2\u00ab-year service in time for admission\r\n\r\nto the Universities in July 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the light of this new enlistment policy\r\n\r\nthat  I want to discuss the subject of exit permits\r\n\r\nfor  those children whose parents want them  to  do\r\n\r\ntheir secondary education overseas. At present,  if\r\n\r\nthey are less than 16\u00bd- years of age, they are  not\r\n\r\ngranted   passports  and  there  have   been   some\r\n\r\ncomplaints in the newspaper columns by parents  who\r\n\r\nwish  to  send their children abroad. My colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Home Affairs, will be introducing\r\n\r\na new Passports Bill which will allow conditions to\r\n\r\nbe  laid  down on the issue of passports.  It  will\r\n\r\nthen  be  possible  to  issue  such  passports   to\r\n\r\nchildren  under  the  age of 16\u00ab  intending  to  go\r\n\r\nabroad for secondary school education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as their national service liability is\r\n\r\nconcerned, they will be treated exactly on the same\r\n\r\nfooting  as  children who do their education  here.\r\n\r\nUnder  no  circumstances  will  these  children  be\r\n\r\ntreated as a privileged group. The Government fully\r\n\r\nendorses the position recently taken by the  unions\r\n\r\naffiliated  to the National Trades Union  Congress.\r\n\r\nParents   will  be  required  to  furnish  adequate\r\n\r\nsecurity by way of cash bond or bank guarantee that\r\n\r\nwhen their children reach their 18th birthday, they\r\n\r\nwill  return to Singapore to do full-time  national\r\n\r\nservice.  Deferment will not be granted on  grounds\r\n\r\nthat  the  students  have  secured  a  place  in  a\r\n\r\nUniversity,  or,  for  that matter,  on  any  other\r\n\r\ngrounds. The bond will be forfeited if the children\r\n\r\ndo  not return, but forfeiture of the bond will not\r\n\r\npreclude the Government from taking other steps  to\r\n\r\nsecure the return of the student to Singapore to do\r\n\r\nhis full-time national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now deal with those graduates who were born\r\n\r\nbefore  1st  January, 1949, and who are  now  doing\r\n\r\nfull-time national service. They feel that they are\r\n\r\nbeing  let  down.  Some  have  even  asked  to   be\r\n\r\ndischarged  from the Army. There is, of course,  no\r\n\r\nquestion of agreeing to this: if any redress is  to\r\n\r\nbe found for them, it must lie in the enlistment of\r\n\r\nthose  graduates who were due to be  enlisted  last\r\n\r\nmonth, but who had been let off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the graduates now doing national service,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  who  have been  commissioned  as\r\n\r\nofficers,   I  want  to  say  that  the  Government\r\n\r\nacknowledges  that it has a special  obligation  to\r\n\r\nthem.  Those with the requisite qualifications  who\r\n\r\nwish   to  apply  for  appointments  in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice, especially in the higher services such  as\r\n\r\nthe  Administrative service, will find  that  their\r\n\r\nmilitary  service will be given due recognition  by\r\n\r\nthe Public Service Commission. I have the agreement\r\n\r\nof  the Chairman, Public Service Commission, to say\r\n\r\nthis.   Furthermore,   the   P.S.C, will   review\r\n\r\nexamination  requirements in the civil service  for\r\n\r\nnational service officers recruited into the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  would be possible to exempt these officers from\r\n\r\nsome,    probably   most,   of   the    examination\r\n\r\nrequirements.  They  will  also  be  given  special\r\n\r\nconsideration   in  respect  of   requirements   of\r\n\r\nprobationary service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers who are due to complete their national\r\n\r\nservice  next year may apply for vacancies  in  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  service while still  in  the  Army, lf\r\n\r\nappointed to the civil service, their Army  service\r\n\r\nwill count as pensionable service and they will get\r\n\r\nfull  increments for the years of  service  in  the\r\n\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defence is proposing to make\r\n\r\navailable  a  number  of  scholarships  for  under-graduate  and  post-graduate studies in  the  local\r\n\r\nUniversities  as  well  as  overseas  Universities.\r\n\r\nOfficers  on  completion of their national  service\r\n\r\nwho are willing to accept a regular commission will\r\n\r\nbe  eligible  to  apply for these scholarships.  If\r\n\r\nthey  are  awarded  such  scholarships,  they  will\r\n\r\nreceive  full  pay as regular officers  during  the\r\n\r\ntenure of their scholarships. Conditions of service\r\n\r\nin  the  Army,  which  are at present  governed  by\r\n\r\nMalaysian  regulations, will be revised to  greatly\r\n\r\nimproved levels. I will give more details of  these\r\n\r\nsubjects at the Second Reading of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another way in which the Government will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to discharge its obligation to  full-time\r\n\r\nnational servicemen. This is by way of implementing\r\n\r\nthe  National Servicemen (Employment) Act which was\r\n\r\npassed by Parliament on 26th June, 1970. A Director\r\n\r\nof Employment has been appointed. He is Mr Lee Ong\r\n\r\nPong,    formerly   Director   of   the    National\r\n\r\nProductivity  Centre.  The  Department   is   being\r\n\r\nestablished  and  should be  in  operation  in  two\r\n\r\nmonths' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All national servicemen are covered by the\r\n\r\nNational  Servicemen (Employment)  Act  during  the\r\n\r\nwhole period of their reserve liability. University\r\n\r\ngraduates who obtained a commission in the Army and\r\n\r\nwho   do  not  belong  to  the  normal  age   group\r\n\r\nregistration, have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  claim  for special attention of the Director  of\r\n\r\nEmployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the National Servicemen (Employment) Act,\r\n\r\nemployers  will  be  required  to  engage  national\r\n\r\nservice   reservists  unless  they  have   obtained\r\n\r\nexemption from the Director of Employment.  So  the\r\n\r\ngraduate officer throughout the whole period of his\r\n\r\nreserve liability will have a safety net should  he\r\n\r\ndecide  to try his fortunes in the private  sector.\r\n\r\nHis  contemporaries who were not enlisted will have\r\n\r\nto  fend for themselves if, for instance, they lose\r\n\r\ntheir jobs in the private sector, as is not unknown\r\n\r\nto happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several other implications in the\r\n\r\nchange of period of enlistment, but my statement is\r\n\r\nalready  too long and these will have to  wait  for\r\n\r\nthe Second Reading of the Bill. However, I want  to\r\n\r\nmake  brief references to two consequences of  some\r\n\r\nsignificance.   The   first   is   that    officers\r\n\r\ncommissioned  under tht existing  Act  have  to  do\r\n\r\nthree  years' service as against 2\u00ab years for those\r\n\r\nenlisted  from  1971 onwards. While many  will  not\r\n\r\nregard  a  difference of six  months  as  of  great\r\n\r\nmoment, others, especially the graduates, may  feel\r\n\r\nthat  their frustrations are being compounded.  The\r\n\r\nother  point  is that the reduction  to  2\u00ab  years'\r\n\r\nservice  for officers creates very serious problems\r\n\r\nin support arms combat units, such as the artillery\r\n\r\nand the engineers. The training period for officers\r\n\r\nin  these units is close on two years. I will  deal\r\n\r\nwith these matters and their possible solutions  at\r\n\r\nsome  length in my Second Reading speech. I mention\r\n\r\nthese  in  passing to register the point that  they\r\n\r\nare being looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>METRICATION BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to introduce the use of the International System\r\n\r\nof   Units   in  Singapore,  to  enable   necessary\r\n\r\nmodifications of legislation to be effected and for\r\n\r\nmatters connected therewith\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented   by   the  Minister  for   Science   and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye);

In  addition,   the\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Training College, which  undertakes  the\r\n\r\nmajor part of the training programme with a student\r\n\r\nenrolment of more than 2,300 in 1969, also conducts\r\n\r\nnumerous  in-service courses on a wide  variety  of\r\n\r\nsubjects  for  qualified teachers.  The  School  of\r\n\r\nEducation  offers only post-graduate  courses,  but\r\n\r\ncaters  jointly with the Teachers' Training College\r\n\r\nfor the basic training of graduate teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two institutions have hitherto fulfilled\r\n\r\nan  essential need in the training of  teachers  to\r\n\r\nstaff  our  schools.  But he  establishment  of  an\r\n\r\nInstitute  of  Education to  centralise  the  whole\r\n\r\ntraining   programme  under  a  single   autonomous\r\n\r\nstatutory  body  will be a positive advancement  in\r\n\r\nteacher   education   in   Singapore,   from    the\r\n\r\nadministrative, professional and academic points of\r\n\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of an independent, statutory\r\n\r\nInstitute   of   Education  will   remove   certain\r\n\r\nlimitations  inherent in the present administration\r\n\r\nof  the  Teachers' Training College as a Government\r\n\r\ndepartment. At present, recruitment to posts at the\r\n\r\nTeachers' Training College is usually limited  only\r\n\r\nto  members  of  the  Education  Service.  Further,\r\n\r\npromotion of lecturers after a certain point  leads\r\n\r\nstaff  members to principal-ships and positions  in\r\n\r\nthe  Inspectorate, resulting in a constant turnover\r\n\r\nof staff at the College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, the Institute of\r\n\r\nEducation,  when  established,  will  be  able,  by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of  its independent status, to appoint  its\r\n\r\nteaching  staff  at professorial and  other  levels\r\n\r\nthrough open advertisement and selection on a merit\r\n\r\nbasis. This will also encourage response from those\r\n\r\nwith   outstanding  qualifications  who  would   be\r\n\r\nwilling to contribute to the advancement of teacher\r\n\r\neducation but are reluctant to be associated with a\r\n\r\nGovernment body. The Institute will also  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition,  by virtue of its autonomous  status,  to\r\n\r\noffer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterms  and conditions of service commensurate  with\r\n\r\nthe  qualifications  of  the  staff  it  hopes   to\r\n\r\nattract.   Visiting  professors  of   international\r\n\r\nstanding  will  be  recruited  to  teach   at   the\r\n\r\ninstitute,   and   only   highly   qualified    and\r\n\r\nexperienced  educators will be recruited  into  its\r\n\r\npermanent establishment. These conditions  will  be\r\n\r\nmore   conducive   to   the  attainment   of   good\r\n\r\nprofessional and academic standards, as well as  to\r\n\r\nthe conducting of educational research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute will have powers to confer degrees\r\n\r\nand diplomas and to grant certificates to those who\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  complete  its courses.  One  proposed\r\n\r\ninnovation which deserves particular mention is the\r\n\r\nintroduction, at a later stage, of courses  leading\r\n\r\nto  the degrees of Bachelor of Education and Master\r\n\r\nof  Education.  The institution of  a  Bachelor  of\r\n\r\nEducation degree has certain advantages. It  has  a\r\n\r\npotential for improving the quality of the teaching\r\n\r\nforce,  as students will be firmly committed  to  a\r\n\r\nteaching  career before they embark on the  course,\r\n\r\nwhich  will be of three years' duration.  There  is\r\n\r\nalso  the time-saving aspect, as it will take  only\r\n\r\nthree years to produce a graduate teacher, compared\r\n\r\nto  four  years  as at present. The  conferment  of\r\n\r\ndegrees  will  also  enhance  the  status  of   the\r\n\r\nteaching   profession.  A  scheme  may   later   be\r\n\r\nintroduced to enable non-graduate serving  teachers\r\n\r\nto obtain this degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of the Institute, the\r\n\r\nSchool  of Education at the University of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill be gradually phased out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute will co-operate with all other\r\n\r\ntertiary institutions on professional matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, provision is made for the\r\n\r\nInstitute  to  be  managed by a Council  including,\r\n\r\namong its members, representatives from Government,\r\n\r\nthe  two  local  Universities, Ngee  Ann  Technical\r\n\r\nCollege, professional bodies and organisations, and\r\n\r\nthe Institute itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Director, to be appointed by the Council, will\r\n\r\nbe the chief administrative and academic officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Board of Studies will be established to advise\r\n\r\nthe  Council on academic matters pertaining to  the\r\n\r\nInstitute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education is empowered under the Bill to make grants to the Institute out of funds to be provided by the House, and any funds received or raised by the Institute will be controlled and administered by the Council subject to the directions of the Minister.

Perhaps due to the heavy work undertaken by the T.T.C, and the great number of teachers it has to train, there is\r\n\r\nstill  much room for improvement in the formulation\r\n\r\nof curricula. Most of the trainee-teachers have one\r\n\r\ncommon  feeling-that it is a drudgery for  them  to\r\n\r\nundergo training at the T.T.C. The curricula at the\r\n\r\nT.T.C, are very complex and varied. Some parts  are\r\n\r\nnot practical. Most of the student teachers are  in\r\n\r\njitters  trying their best to meet the requirements\r\n\r\nof  their lecturers, hoping to go through the  mill\r\n\r\nas quickly as possible in order to gain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  certificate to make a living. However,  many  of\r\n\r\nthem  feel that what they have learnt at the T.T.C.\r\n\r\ncannot be put into practice in the classrooms. What\r\n\r\nthe lecturers advocate in the T.T.C, may not be the\r\n\r\nsame  as  what  is  demanded by the  inspectors  of\r\n\r\nschools.  So  the  teachers do  not  know  whom  to\r\n\r\nplease. However, it must be admitted that there are\r\n\r\nmany  good  teachers and lecturers  at  the  T.T.C.\r\n\r\nHowever,  these teachers are sometimes  transferred\r\n\r\nto  the  Ministry of Education to do administrative\r\n\r\nwork,  or  they  may be appointed as principals  in\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools.  We  know  that  we  need  good\r\n\r\nlecturers  to  train  good teachers.  We  hope  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of  Education will be  able  to  recruit\r\n\r\ncapable  teachers and lecturers and devise  methods\r\n\r\nto retain the services of these people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the T.T.C, is taken into the Institute of\r\n\r\nEducation,  its  many  good  features   should   be\r\n\r\nincorporated   into   the   Institute    and    its\r\n\r\nshortcomings  rectified so that the  Institute  can\r\n\r\nbecome a centre for the training of the \"engineers\"\r\n\r\nof our national mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the course of education is a long process and knowledge in education is increasing rapidly. Teachers should improve themselves by attending courses and seminars. The Ministry should encourage teachers to improve themselves. There are teachers with a B.A, degree who, after attending\r\n\r\ncourses, are able to get a Master's degree. But  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  this additional qualification, they  are\r\n\r\ngiven  the  pay  of  an Honours graduate.  This  is\r\n\r\nunreasonable.  I  have received petitions  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter from more than 10 teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, teachers in secondary and primary schools have limited opportunities for promotion. Some of them, faithful to their duty, remain teachers throughout their whole lives. The Ministry should think of ways and means to give primary school teachers an opportunity for further\r\n\r\nstudy and obtain higher academic qualifications  to\r\n\r\nbecome   qualified   secondary   school   teachers.\r\n\r\nTeachers in the secondary schools should be given\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  opportunity  to  do research  in  education  to\r\n\r\nacquire a higher degree. They should be given fully-paid leave while doing their research. I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  Minister  whether  the  Institute  of\r\n\r\nEducation will give them such opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, education is a lengthy process, and about three-quarters of our population are school children. What will become of them will depend on the 20,000-odd teachers. The setting up of the Institute of Education will help raise the quality of teachers which, in turn, will enhance\r\n\r\nthe  quality of the population. Let me reaffirm  my\r\n\r\nstand. I fully support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe first thing I wish to say is that I am glad  an\r\n\r\namendment is proposed to clause 4 (1) (c)  of  this\r\n\r\nBill,  so  that one of the objects of the Institute\r\n\r\nof  Education will be the promotion of research  in\r\n\r\neducation  and  not, as could have been  originally\r\n\r\nimplied,  the  promotion  of  research  in  teacher\r\n\r\neducation. Whatever possible implications there may\r\n\r\nbe,  the  wording  of  the  original  paragraph  in\r\n\r\nquestion   seems   to  me  to   have   been   quite\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory. Now we have a clearer and,  indeed,\r\n\r\na  more liberal statement of the research functions\r\n\r\nof the Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what are the functions of the Institute in\r\n\r\nrespect of the education of our teachers? I  notice\r\n\r\nthat  courses  of  study will be provided  for  the\r\n\r\ntraining  of  teachers  in the  various  fields  of\r\n\r\neducation at all levels. This would imply that  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  may be the only duly accredited  teacher\r\n\r\neducation  establishment in Singapore. Inasmuch  as\r\n\r\nthe T.T.C, has already done this, the Institute  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  going to take over what used to  be  the\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  the  University  of  Singapore,  for\r\n\r\nexample, at the level of graduate teacher training.\r\n\r\nThus  we  find  that this Institute  is  apparently\r\n\r\ngoing   to  be  endowed  with  pretty  wide-ranging\r\n\r\nfunctions.  This view is somewhat substantiated  by\r\n\r\nclause 4 (2) (e) , by which this Institute\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill   be   empowered   to  institute   and   award\r\n\r\nfellowships,  exhibitions and so on, and  forms  of\r\n\r\nassistance    towards    the    advancement     and\r\n\r\ndissemination of knowledge, presumably knowledge in\r\n\r\ngeneral,  because no qualification  is  stipulated.\r\n\r\nAnd  yet when we look at clause 4 (1) (a) , we  find\r\n\r\nthat  the  study courses provided will be  for  the\r\n\r\ntraining of teachers in education. In other  words,\r\n\r\nit  seems  to  me  that  the  emphasis  is  on  the\r\n\r\npedagogical  aspects of training, to the  exclusion\r\n\r\nof  the  academic aspects. We have just  heard  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education say that the Institute  will\r\n\r\nintroduce  courses  leading to  the  award  of  the\r\n\r\ndegrees  of  Bachelor of Education  and  Master  of\r\n\r\nEducation.   Presumably,   the   people   who   are\r\n\r\ncandidates  for these degrees will be  coming  from\r\n\r\nschools with the Higher School Certificate  or  the\r\n\r\nSchool  Leaving Certificate. It seems  to  me  that\r\n\r\nthese   people  will  have  to  be  provided   with\r\n\r\nknowledge of the contents of certain disciplines as\r\n\r\nwell as knowledge of the pedagogical aspects of how\r\n\r\nthey  are going to teach these disciplines  in  the\r\n\r\nschools. So we have to think of equipping the would-be  teachers  themselves in the various disciplines\r\n\r\napart  from  education. These teachers,  especially\r\n\r\nthose  going  to  the secondary and  post-secondary\r\n\r\nclasses, will have to possess an adequate and,  may\r\n\r\nI  emphasise,  a lively knowledge of  the  subjects\r\n\r\nthey will have to teach. And yet the objects of the\r\n\r\nInstitute are expressed in this Bill in terms  that\r\n\r\nseem  to  exclude the equipping of  our  apprentice\r\n\r\nteachers with the effective knowledge of what  they\r\n\r\nare going to teach as apart from how they are going\r\n\r\nto teach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that whoever gave the brief for\r\n\r\nthe  drafting  of  the objects of  this  Institute,\r\n\r\nespecially in their original form, may have had the\r\n\r\npresent Teachers' Training College in mind.  It  is\r\n\r\nhoped  that this Bill will not simply result  in  a\r\n\r\nmore  impressive name for the T.T.C., but that  the\r\n\r\nopportunity will be grasped for a new milestone  to\r\n\r\nbe marked in the fundamental development of teacher\r\n\r\neducation facilities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Jurong that the\r\n\r\nTeachers' Training College has served a most useful\r\n\r\npurpose.  While taking as much care as possible  to\r\n\r\nensure  quality within the prevailing  constraints,\r\n\r\nits  chief function has been to produce the  number\r\n\r\nof teachers required to staff the schools which the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been energetically establishing.  It\r\n\r\nis  time  now to consolidate our position vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nthe  quality of our educators. Nowhere in the  Bill\r\n\r\nis there any indication of the relationship of this\r\n\r\nInstitute   to  other  institutions   of   tertiary\r\n\r\neducation   in  Singapore.  Thus  this   autonomous\r\n\r\nInstitute of Education has the grave responsibility\r\n\r\nof  ensuring  the quality of the teachers  we  will\r\n\r\nproduce  and  that  the teachers  we  have  already\r\n\r\nproduced  will  be  given  all  the  facilities  to\r\n\r\ndevelop   to   their  satisfaction   and   to   the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction of our society in their chosen career.\r\n\r\nInasmuch  as our teacher educators have been  equal\r\n\r\nto  the  particular challenges of the past, I  hope\r\n\r\nthey   will   be  equal  to  the  more  significant\r\n\r\nchallenges of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  before this House seeks to  establish  a\r\n\r\ncorporate  body  to be known as the  \"Institute  of\r\n\r\nEducation\"  which  will  make  provision  for   the\r\n\r\ntraining  of  teachers  in  Singapore  and  promote\r\n\r\nresearch in the various fields of education. To  my\r\n\r\nmind,  this  move  opens up a new spectrum  in  our\r\n\r\npresent efforts to seek qualitative improvement  in\r\n\r\nour education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the financial and human resources available\r\n\r\nto  the  Education Ministry in the past were geared\r\n\r\nand  strained to meet the expansion of  schools  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the objective of providing every school-going\r\n\r\nchild a place in school, with the result that  very\r\n\r\nlittle attention was paid to the improvement in the\r\n\r\nquality of education. Whatever efforts were made in\r\n\r\nthe   past   in   the  direction   of   qualitative\r\n\r\nimprovement  were  only ad hoc  measures  and  were\r\n\r\nneither comprehensive nor co-ordinated. It is hoped\r\n\r\nthat with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestablishment  of the Institute of  Education,  all\r\n\r\nefforts  aimed  at qualitative improvement  in  all\r\n\r\naspects  of  our educational system,  ranging  from\r\n\r\ncurriculum development to teacher training, will be\r\n\r\ncarried  out more systematically, efficiently,  and\r\n\r\nwith  imagination,  with a  touch  of  professional\r\n\r\nexpertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the attainment of the objective of\r\n\r\nquantitative  education, it is now imperative  that\r\n\r\nstudy  and  research  be made  into  the  different\r\n\r\naspects of our educational development in the  past\r\n\r\ndecade.   In   the  past,  changes  made   in   the\r\n\r\neducational system were not only radical and rapid,\r\n\r\nbut  were  also  made  to meet  certain  underlying\r\n\r\npolitical objectives of nation-building,  with  the\r\n\r\nresult   that   high  educational   standards   and\r\n\r\nobjectives sometimes had to be sacrificed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one in his right frame of mind will dispute\r\n\r\nthe  need to gear our educational system to  attain\r\n\r\ncertain   underlying   political   objectives    of\r\n\r\ninculcating  a  sense  of  loyalty  and  pride   of\r\n\r\nbelonging  to Singapore, of building a multi-racial\r\n\r\nand  harmonious  society, and of restructuring  our\r\n\r\neducational  system to meet the needs  of  manpower\r\n\r\nrequirements  in the fast-changing pattern  of  our\r\n\r\neconomic development and progress. What I  wish  to\r\n\r\npoint  out, however, is that we must not lose sight\r\n\r\nof  the educational standards and objectives at the\r\n\r\nsame  time.  Whether  -a  review  is  necessary  of\r\n\r\ncertain  educational  activities  that  have   been\r\n\r\ncarried  out so far in Singapore schools,  and  how\r\n\r\nimprovements  can  be  made  in  the  direction  of\r\n\r\nqualitative education, are matters that require the\r\n\r\nattention of educational experts engaged in  proper\r\n\r\nresearch, study and analysis of the various  fields\r\n\r\nof education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that the proposed Institute of\r\n\r\nEducation  will have, among its staff, experts  who\r\n\r\nwill  be able to evaluate the progress we have made\r\n\r\nin  our educational development in the past decade,\r\n\r\nas  well as spotlight the pitfalls we have stumbled\r\n\r\ninto,    and    make    expert    and    applicable\r\n\r\nrecommendations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor improvement in qualitative education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to another subject that will come\r\n\r\nwithin  the  purview of the proposed  Institute  of\r\n\r\nEducation - I am referring to teacher training. The\r\n\r\nadaptation of our educational system to  the  needs\r\n\r\nof  modem Singapore necessitates higher and broader\r\n\r\nqualifications for the teachers who  will  have  to\r\n\r\nprepare  young  people  to live  and  work  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  an increasingly complex  economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial  organisation. Moreover,  the  good  initial\r\n\r\ntraining for teachers is not enough at a time  like\r\n\r\nours  when  the  content,  methods  and  media   of\r\n\r\neducation   are  necessarily  undergoing   constant\r\n\r\nchanges.  The systematic organisation of  refresher\r\n\r\nand advanced courses and a wide range of in-service\r\n\r\ncourses  on teachers' education will enable serving\r\n\r\nteachers  to  add continually to their professional\r\n\r\nas  well as academic knowledge, and keep up to date\r\n\r\nwith  developments in all fields  of  education  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  will not lose touch with  progress  and\r\n\r\nbecome   inefficient.  But   improvement   in   the\r\n\r\neconomic, no less than the professional, status  of\r\n\r\nteachers is required if serving teachers are to  be\r\n\r\nencouraged  to  feel obliged to  seek  professional\r\n\r\nimprovement. The improvement of the economic status\r\n\r\nof   teachers  is  primarily  a  matter  of  social\r\n\r\njustice, since the qualifications required for this\r\n\r\ncategory of workers and the tasks assigned to  them\r\n\r\nare  becoming  ever  more  complex  and  demanding,\r\n\r\nparticularly  when their role is  extending  beyond\r\n\r\nthe confines of the schools because of the part the\r\n\r\nteachers  must play today in community development.\r\n\r\nTeachers  must  enjoy  a status  commensurate  with\r\n\r\ntheir role.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Institute of Education, in\r\n\r\nconsultation with teachers' unions, should  promote\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of a wide system  of  in-service\r\n\r\nteacher  education, and adequate incentive schemes,\r\n\r\ndevised   by   the  Ministry  of  Education   after\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  teachers'  unions,  should   be\r\n\r\noffered   to   serving   teachers   on   successful\r\n\r\ncompletion  of  any  in-service course  on  teacher\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute should also focus its attention on\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in  the  education  service,  keeping\r\n\r\nschools  abreast  of the results  of  research  and\r\n\r\nmethodological progress, as well as  reflecting  in\r\n\r\nits   own  work  the  experience  of  schools   and\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute should also provide adequate\r\n\r\nfurther  teacher-education  programmes  to   enable\r\n\r\nserving  non-graduate teachers in both primary  and\r\n\r\nsecondary schools to seek professional and academic\r\n\r\nadvancement especially when they are required  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time  to shoulder additional professional\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. The present non-graduate teachers\r\n\r\nare a case in point. Though trained essentially  to\r\n\r\nteach  in primary schools, they are posted to teach\r\n\r\nin   secondary  schools,  sometimes  at  the  upper\r\n\r\nsecondary   level   of  education   where   trained\r\n\r\nuniversity graduate teachers are supposed to teach.\r\n\r\nThis  has been the position in the past decade when\r\n\r\nthe  Education  Ministry has been  faced  with  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  attracting and recruiting an  adequate\r\n\r\nnumber  of university graduate teachers to man  the\r\n\r\nsecondary schools particularly from secondary three\r\n\r\nlevel upwards. It is a credit to those serving non-graduate  teachers that they have admirably  played\r\n\r\ntheir role and proved their ability and worth. They\r\n\r\nhave  discharged their responsibilities  very  well\r\n\r\nand  produced  good results with the students  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  taught. It can also be said  that  many\r\n\r\nserving  non-graduate teachers in primary  schools,\r\n\r\nwhen posted to secondary schools, will also respond\r\n\r\njust  as  well  to their new role. This  is  to  be\r\n\r\nexpected as they all went through the same training\r\n\r\nin the Teachers' Training College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No recognition of any kind is given to the non-graduate teachers in secondary schools for\r\n\r\nshouldering increased responsibilities that  should\r\n\r\nnormally  be  carried  out by  university  graduate\r\n\r\nteachers. It is imperative, therefore, that one  of\r\n\r\nthe   paramount  concerns  of  the   Institute   of\r\n\r\nEducation must be the promotion of further teacher-education  programmes  at degree/diploma  level  to\r\n\r\nenable serving non-graduate teachers to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\navail  themselves of such opportunities to increase\r\n\r\ntheir   academic   knowledge  and   upgrade   their\r\n\r\nprofessional  skills  and  status   so   that,   on\r\n\r\nsuccessful   completion  of   such   degree/diploma\r\n\r\nteacher-education courses, they can  be  placed  on\r\n\r\npar  with university graduate teachers in terms  of\r\n\r\nstatus and service conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that consideration must be given\r\n\r\nto   the   fact   that  many  serving  non-graduate\r\n\r\nteachers,  meriting consideration for  professional\r\n\r\nand  academic upgrading courses, are often  married\r\n\r\nmen   with   both  responsibilities  and  financial\r\n\r\ncommitments  that  normally go  with  married  men.\r\n\r\nLeave for studies in such courses therefore must be\r\n\r\non  full pay, and their experience in teaching must\r\n\r\nbe  taken as adequate entry qualification  for  any\r\n\r\nsuch courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent for me at this juncture to seek\r\n\r\nclarification  from the Minister for  Education  on\r\n\r\nthe following queries that I wish to raise:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. During the transitional period of change when\r\n\r\nteacher  training is transferred from  the  present\r\n\r\nTeachers'   Training  College   to   the   proposed\r\n\r\nInstitute   of  Education,  is  the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  taking immediate steps  to  recruit  and\r\n\r\ntrain  more  teachers  to meet  the  present  acute\r\n\r\nshortage   of   teachers  in  the  schools   today,\r\n\r\nnormalise  the  staffing position in  schools,  and\r\n\r\nreduce to the minimum the present position where  a\r\n\r\nfar  too  excessive number of relief  teachers  are\r\n\r\nemployed  on  an ad hoc basis to meet  the  present\r\n\r\nacute shortage of teachers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Why is the Ministry of Education not providing\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  the  present  pool   of   relief\r\n\r\nteachers  to  undergo  teacher  training  and  seek\r\n\r\npermanent employment in the Ministry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Is the Ministry aware that while, on the one\r\n\r\nhand,  there is a shortage of teachers, there  are,\r\n\r\non  the  other  hand, some teachers who  have  just\r\n\r\ncompleted  their  full-time teacher  training  this\r\n\r\nyear who are not offered employment in the teaching\r\n\r\nservice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Does the Minister for Education envisage the\r\n\r\nproposed  Institute of Education  to  continue  the\r\n\r\npresent policy in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespect  of teacher training, namely, that  student\r\n\r\nteachers, on successful completion of their teacher\r\n\r\ntraining, will not be guaranteed employment in  the\r\n\r\neducation  service?  If this policy  is  continued,\r\n\r\ndoes   the  Ministry  not  see  this  as  a   great\r\n\r\ndisincentive  to future aspirants to  the  teaching\r\n\r\nservice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. What will happen to the fate of the present\r\n\r\nlecturing  staff in the Teachers' Training  College\r\n\r\nwhen teacher training is taken over by the proposed\r\n\r\nInstitute of Education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Will those members of the present T.T.C.\r\n\r\nlecturing staff holding substantive appointments as\r\n\r\nassistant lecturers, lecturers, etc., at present be\r\n\r\nabsorbed  automatically  into  the  staff  of   the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of Education? And will those members  of\r\n\r\nthe  present T.T.C, lecturing staff holding  acting\r\n\r\nappointments   and  who  have  given   satisfactory\r\n\r\nlecturing  service for a period of  time  be  given\r\n\r\nspecial  preference  by the proposed  Institute  of\r\n\r\nEducation in its recruitment of staff?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. What will be the scheme of service of the staff\r\n\r\nof  the proposed Institute of Education? Will it be\r\n\r\nsimilar  to the existing scheme of service  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  T.T.C, lecturing staff,  or  will  it  be\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  existing schemes  of  service  in  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic or Ngee Ann Technical College?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Will the present T.T.C, lecturing staff be given\r\n\r\nan  opportunity  to  make  representations  through\r\n\r\ntheir teachers' union on their future position when\r\n\r\nthe  proposed Institute of Education is established\r\n\r\nand  takes  over  the function of teacher  training\r\n\r\nfrom the present T.T.C.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, in conclusion, express the hope that, as\r\n\r\na  result  of  the  proposed establishment  of  the\r\n\r\nInstitute   of  Education,  the  current  promotion\r\n\r\nexercise  for  T.T.C, lecturers  in  relation   to\r\n\r\nappointments in the T.T.C, will not be frozen,  but\r\n\r\nwill  be  carried out as indicated  in  the  recent\r\n\r\nvacancy minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to add that the term \"teachers\" in\r\n\r\nthe context of my speech\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoday  also  includes principals of schools,  since\r\n\r\nthey are also practising teachers basically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I feel that the Institute of Education Bill is\r\n\r\nan  important  Bill because it will make  provision\r\n\r\nfor  the  training of teachers in our  country.  In\r\n\r\nrecent  years,  we have heard from various  sources\r\n\r\nthat  we  will raise the quality of our educational\r\n\r\nsystem in order to produce qualified personnel  who\r\n\r\nwill be able to make a contribution to our country.\r\n\r\nThe  Institute  of Education will become  a  higher\r\n\r\ninstitution  of education for our country  and  can\r\n\r\nchange  the  nature and quality of our  educational\r\n\r\nsystem  for the better. It is most appropriate  for\r\n\r\nMembers  to contribute their views to the House  on\r\n\r\nthis Bill. I would like to add only a few points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has said that at present\r\n\r\nthere are shortcomings in the courses conducted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Teachers' Training College. He feels that some\r\n\r\nof  them are of no practical value. But he has  not\r\n\r\nsuggested to the House how to improve these courses\r\n\r\nso  as  to  make them more practical  in  order  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  the  younger  generation.  We  have  often\r\n\r\nstressed that there is a shortage of technical  and\r\n\r\nmanagerial personnel. We have often heard that  the\r\n\r\nnumber of students turned out by our schools cannot\r\n\r\nmeet  the  demands  of our industries  and  various\r\n\r\ninstitutions. I would like to ask the  Minister  to\r\n\r\npay  special attention to this problem and get  the\r\n\r\nInstitute to speed up its output of students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I would like to make is\r\n\r\nthat  we should have teachers and teacher educators\r\n\r\nwith good physique because we are striving to build\r\n\r\na  rugged  society. So we should also pay attention\r\n\r\nto  this aspect of physical education, particularly\r\n\r\nfor teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point I want to make touches on the\r\n\r\nfield  of  culture. We are very short  of  artistic\r\n\r\npersonnel - artists,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncultural activists and others in the field of  fine\r\n\r\narts  and  drama. I hope there will be teachers  to\r\n\r\nfill  this gap, and also that art courses  will  be\r\n\r\nconducted.  If the Institute of Education  develops\r\n\r\nalong  the  proper channels, it  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nproduce sufficient talented people for our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me join\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues, the Members for Jurong, Katong  and\r\n\r\nMoulmein, in complimenting the Minister on bringing\r\n\r\nforth this Institute of Education Bill which is, in\r\n\r\nmy  opinion, a little long overdue. Let me  at  the\r\n\r\nsame time hasten to add my tribute to the T.T.C, to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  believe we are playing a swan  song.  The\r\n\r\nT.T.C, did  its  duty when we wanted  quantitative\r\n\r\neducation. We have spoken on qualitative  education\r\n\r\nbefore.  In establishing an Institute of  Education\r\n\r\nwhich we hope will bring about teachers of quality,\r\n\r\nthere are a number of matters that we will have  to\r\n\r\ntake into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the important aspects in our secondary\r\n\r\neducation  today  is, as has already  been  pointed\r\n\r\nout,  mainly  managed  by  teachers  who  are  non-graduates and who are not really trained  to  teach\r\n\r\nin  secondary schools. We owe a great debt to these\r\n\r\nnon-graduate teachers in our secondary schools  for\r\n\r\nthe  unstinted service that they have put  in  over\r\n\r\nthe years. I hope this Institute will give them  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  better  themselves  so  that   the\r\n\r\nstandard  of qualitative education and the contents\r\n\r\nof  the  subjects being taught in secondary schools\r\n\r\nare  improved. I was glad to hear from the Minister\r\n\r\nthat  the Institute will open its doors to  serving\r\n\r\nteachers  to  improve their teaching techniques  as\r\n\r\nwell as knowledge of the contents of the subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the number of Honours graduates\r\n\r\nand  graduate  teachers  in  secondary  schools  is\r\n\r\nlimited.  They specialise in certain  subjects  and\r\n\r\nprefer  to  teach only the subjects in  which  they\r\n\r\nobtain  their  Honours degrees,  whereas  the  non-graduate teachers - unfortunately being specialists\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  nothing  -- are expected to teach all  subjects\r\n\r\nallotted  to them. Therefore, I would suggest  that\r\n\r\nin  giving  in-service courses to the  non-graduate\r\n\r\nteachers who are teaching in secondary schools now,\r\n\r\nwe  may  have to shorten the course that a  school-leaver  would normally have to undergo to  complete\r\n\r\nhis Bachelor of Education Degree. The Minister says\r\n\r\nthat the BE. Degree course will be done in a three-year  period.  I  presume  this  three-year  period\r\n\r\ncourse is for those fresh from school who have gone\r\n\r\ninto  the Institute of Education to obtain the B.E.\r\n\r\nDegree. Teachers who have served a number of  years\r\n\r\nin secondary schools should be given an opportunity\r\n\r\nto  complete the course earlier. If this course  is\r\n\r\ngoing   to   be  a  full-time  course,   sufficient\r\n\r\nincentive should be given to them. In other  words,\r\n\r\npaid  leave should be given to them to attend these\r\n\r\ncourses full-time, or a part-time in-service course\r\n\r\nleading to a degree. In this way, they can learn as\r\n\r\nwell  as teach at the same time. I am not too  sure\r\n\r\nif  these questions have been thrashed out. If they\r\n\r\nhave  been, I would like to hear from the  Minister\r\n\r\nof  any  details  that he has worked  out  for  the\r\n\r\nserving teachers in secondary schools to go to  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  to  obtain a degree. We  have  heard  on\r\n\r\nprevious  occasions  that  serving  teachers   were\r\n\r\nhaving difficulty in obtaining permission to attend\r\n\r\nuniversity  courses  on paid  leave.  Further,  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  is  not  providing  in-service  courses\r\n\r\nwhich  will  lead to a degree or higher  degree.  A\r\n\r\nnumber of teachers went to the University and did a\r\n\r\ndegree  course,  but  they never  returned  to  the\r\n\r\nschools.  I hope we will not make the same  mistake\r\n\r\nand that some sort of arrangements will be made  so\r\n\r\nthat we will continue to have their services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very glad\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member for Telok Blangah has  spoken  in\r\n\r\nappreciation   of  the  role  that  the   Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining College has played in the expansion of our\r\n\r\neducational  services. Just now we heard  from  the\r\n\r\nMember\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong  who said that although the T.T.C, had\r\n\r\ntrained 20,000 teachers, there were certain aspects\r\n\r\nwith which he was not happy. I do not think this is\r\n\r\nthe  time  and  place to consider  the  merits  and\r\n\r\ndemerits of the T.T.C. It is most appropriate  that\r\n\r\nwe  should  pay  tribute to  an  institution  which\r\n\r\nserved its purpose well during a period when we had\r\n\r\nto expand the educational service quantitatively. I\r\n\r\nwould  not  like  to  be drawn  into  a  debate  on\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service by the Member  for  Jurong.\r\n\r\nThere will be a time and occasion for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of setting up the Institute of Education by the Ministry of Education is to raise the standard of teaching, and though it is not written in detail in the Bill, it is, of course, implied that students who attend the Institute will be inculcated with what the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Katong described as \"a lively knowledge of the\r\n\r\nsubjects  which they will be teaching\". It  is  not\r\n\r\npossible to spell out in detail the objects, but  I\r\n\r\nbelieve they are implied there, and I can rely upon\r\n\r\nmembers of the Council, when they are appointed, to\r\n\r\nsee  that  the teachers who are turned out  by  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  will have a lively knowledge and  lively\r\n\r\ncuriosity  of  the  subjects  which  they  will  be\r\n\r\nteaching. I can assure the Member for Moulmein that\r\n\r\nI will always make full use of professional advice.\r\n\r\nIn my career I have found that it is always wise to\r\n\r\nlisten  to, though not always to accept, the advice\r\n\r\nof  the professionals. I can assure the Member  and\r\n\r\nhis  colleagues that I will make full use of  their\r\n\r\nknowledge  of the teaching service. I  will  do  my\r\n\r\nvery  best  to  tap  all  that  I  can  from  their\r\n\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noted the suggestion made by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Moulmein on the in-service scheme and I am sure\r\n\r\nthe  Council of the Institute will look  thoroughly\r\n\r\ninto the proposal which he has made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member seeks clarification on certain\r\n\r\nquestions  that  he has posed. I  am  not  able  to\r\n\r\nanswer them in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder  that  he put them, but I would say  this  in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  position of the-present  lecturing\r\n\r\nstaff  of  the  T.T.C, when the Teachers'  Training\r\n\r\nCollege   is   taken  over  by  the  Institute   of\r\n\r\nEducation. Let me assure the Member that they  will\r\n\r\nbe in no way worse off than they are. The Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining  College is-now part of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation.  If  any  of the  staff  there  are  not\r\n\r\nabsorbed  by the Institute of Education, they  will\r\n\r\nbe taken into the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the scheme of service-for the\r\n\r\nInstitute of Education, it is too early yet  to  go\r\n\r\ninto the details, but since this is an institute of\r\n\r\ntertiary  education, I will equate  it  with  other\r\n\r\ninstitutes  of  tertiary education.  The  Institute\r\n\r\nwill have chairs, professorships, lectureships  and\r\n\r\nother  posts  and  officers  in  keeping  with  its\r\n\r\nstatus.  I  do  not think the terms and  conditions\r\n\r\nwill be in any way inferior to those obtainable  in\r\n\r\nthe T.T.C, now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government does not stop its employees\r\n\r\nfrom  making representations to it, I do not  think\r\n\r\nthere  is  any need for them to go to the teachers'\r\n\r\nunions   for  any  representation  in  this   case,\r\n\r\nbecause,  as  I  say,  they will  be  in  no  worse\r\n\r\nposition than they are now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are trying our best to redress the shortage of\r\n\r\nteachers.   This   year  we  have   put   out   two\r\n\r\nadvertisements for teachers, but the  response  has\r\n\r\nnot been very encouraging. This is something beyond\r\n\r\nour  control, and I am afraid we have to  use  non-graduate teachers to fill the breach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the question of relief teachers. The\r\n\r\nMember  mentioned relief teachers seeking  training\r\n\r\nand   permanent  employment  in  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation.  The opportunity is always  there.  They\r\n\r\ncan  always make their applications and every  case\r\n\r\nwill be considered on its own merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein also brought up the\r\n\r\nquestion  of shortage of teachers. He alleged  that\r\n\r\nwhile  there  is a shortage of teachers  under  the\r\n\r\npresent  circumstances, those  who  have  qualified\r\n\r\nhave not been offered employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese  cases are very few and far between. This  is\r\n\r\nlargely due to some administrative difficulties.  I\r\n\r\nshall be very glad if these cases can be brought to\r\n\r\nmy    notice.   If   they   have   the    requisite\r\n\r\nqualifications, I will see that they are  appointed\r\n\r\nimmediately. This is one of the problems caused  by\r\n\r\nour  not  having enough wide-awake  people  in  our\r\n\r\nadministration.  I  can quote  a  case.  I  sent  a\r\n\r\ntelegram  here from Geneva. It arrived on the  same\r\n\r\nday, but it took two days for it to travel from the\r\n\r\nground  floor to the seventh floor of the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education  to  the  Acting  Minister!  This  is\r\n\r\nprobably  one of the snags which have held  up  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  suitably qualified  teachers  even\r\n\r\nthough we are really short of teachers. May I  also\r\n\r\nsay  that we are looking into the case that I  have\r\n\r\njust quoted, where it took longer for a telegram to\r\n\r\nclimb up six floors than for it to come from Geneva\r\n\r\nto  here.  I  think  I have answered  most  of  the\r\n\r\nproblems  raised. There may be one or  two  others,\r\n\r\nbut  they are not really significant. They  can  be\r\n\r\nraised later on if the occasion arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Lim Kim San].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 3 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, lines 17 and 18, to leave out \"the\r\n\r\nvarious fields of education for teachers\" and\r\n\r\ninsert \"education\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Katong has drawn the\r\n\r\nattention of the House to the improvement that will\r\n\r\nbe brought about by this amendment.

The Select Committee received\r\n\r\noral  evidence  from witnesses from  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nRugby    Union,   the   Singapore   Table    Tennis\r\n\r\nAssociation, and the Singapore Olympic  and  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the National Sports Promotion Board is\r\n\r\nbeing  formed,  I  am confident  that  the  correct\r\n\r\nfoundation has been laid for active and substantial\r\n\r\nconcern  for, and involvement of the public  sector\r\n\r\nin,   the   development  of  sports  consciousness,\r\n\r\nactivity and standards in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Sports Promotion Board is\r\n\r\ncomprehensively  being  provided  with  legislative\r\n\r\npowers  to take on responsibility for the promotion\r\n\r\nand  co-ordination of sports in the country. Sports\r\n\r\nis  now being given proper national recognition and\r\n\r\nthe  Board should, with single-minded objective and\r\n\r\ndevotion, promote and propagate sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Bill, Government accepts the\r\n\r\nimportance  and  role of sports  and  the  need  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the National Sports Promotion  Board  with\r\n\r\nsufficient  financial  capacity  in  this   regard,\r\n\r\nbesides  providing  for all  sports  facilities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore by transferring them to the Board by this\r\n\r\nBill.  Government also undertakes to subsidise  the\r\n\r\nBoard with what it now costs the Government for the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of  existing public sports  facilities\r\n\r\nannually.  It has also been agreed in principle  to\r\n\r\nassist the Board to meet its recurrent expenditure,\r\n\r\nincluding financial grants to sports organisations,\r\n\r\nto enable them to organise proper schemes for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopularisation  and promotion of standards  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious national sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We accept the position of sports as integral to\r\n\r\nrecreation and essential for leisure.

At the moment, whilst sand  quarries\r\n\r\nare licensed, granite quarries are not.

Further, granite is  an\r\n\r\nimportant   building  material  to   the   building\r\n\r\nindustry  which is rapidly expanding in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  is,  therefore, a pressing need for  granite\r\n\r\nquarries   to  be  licensed  and  their  activities\r\n\r\nbrought  under  proper control. The control  is  to\r\n\r\nensure that there will be proper supervision of the\r\n\r\nuse  of  mechanically accepted plant and  equipment\r\n\r\nfor quarrying operations, as well as the imposition\r\n\r\nof adequate safety measures to prevent any nuisance\r\n\r\nor  danger or damage to life or property.

However,  I  must\r\n\r\nexpress my regret and disappointment that there are\r\n\r\nno  provisions  to  protect the  life,  health  and\r\n\r\nsafety  of  the workers. There is little on  safety\r\n\r\nexcept  in  clause 13.

There is no mention of precautions to  be\r\n\r\ntaken  against  the great danger  of  silicosis  to\r\n\r\nworkers.  I  understand  that  silicosis   can   he\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by (a) the use of exhaust  ventilation,\r\n\r\nand (b) the use of wetting methods, and (c) the use\r\n\r\nof  respirators. I hope regulations will be made by\r\n\r\nthe Minister for the purpose of ensuring the health\r\n\r\nand safety of people working in granite quarries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe some studies have been made in the past\r\n\r\nregarding  the occurrence of silicosis  in  granite\r\n\r\nquarries.  I  understand that a study  made  of  40\r\n\r\nworkers  of an original group of 62 men  and  women\r\n\r\nattending Medical Unit II. Silicosis Clinic. Outram\r\n\r\nRoad General Hospital, since 1955 was reviewed  for\r\n\r\nmorbidity.  It was found that (a) the incidence  of\r\n\r\nsilicosis  had increased by 16 per cent from  80.69\r\n\r\nper  cent  in  1955 to 96.7 per cent in  1968;  (b)\r\n\r\nsilico-tuberculosis  had increased  from  24.2  per\r\n\r\ncent  to  43.7 per cent: (c) the highest  mortality\r\n\r\nand  morbidity  rates were seen among crusher-stone\r\n\r\ntruckers, crusher feeders and driers; (d) resistant\r\n\r\npulmonary  tuberculosis and pneumothorax  were  the\r\n\r\nmain causes of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the authorities will look into the dangers\r\n\r\nthat  are prevalent in granite quarries, and I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  will assure the House that  he  will\r\n\r\nintroduce more comprehensive legislation,  such  as\r\n\r\nis  found  in the United Kingdom Mines and Quarries\r\n\r\nAct  of  1954.  Will the Minister also  assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that the P.W.D, has the necessary  personnel\r\n\r\nto  administer satisfactorily the safety provisions\r\n\r\nin  the Bill? In the past, the Factory Inspectorate\r\n\r\nin  the Ministry of Labour could not manage  to  do\r\n\r\nso, so much so that many granite quarry workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   suffer  from  some  form  of  pulmonary\r\n\r\ndisease.  However,  since the Factory  Inspectorate\r\n\r\nwill  be strengthened considerably I have a written\r\n\r\nassurance from the Ministry of Labour that it  will\r\n\r\nbe  so  -  will  the Minister designate  the  Chief\r\n\r\nInspector of Factories to be the Licensing  Officer\r\n\r\nreferred  to  in  clause 3 of the Bill,  with  tile\r\n\r\ncourtesy anti agreement of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour of course?

The Government and the private sector are\r\n\r\nboth  engaged  in  the construction  of  buildings.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the network of roads is being extended\r\n\r\ncontinuously. This means that the use of  sand  and\r\n\r\ngranite is increasing every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill provides for the licensing and control\r\n\r\nof  sand  and granite quarries with provisions  for\r\n\r\nsafety  measures.  Without these  safety  measures,\r\n\r\nworkers  may  be injured or killed,  thus  bringing\r\n\r\nmisery  to  their families. So the introduction  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill should be welcomed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out that with the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the Bill, the  revenue  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry  will also be increased and it  will  be  a\r\n\r\ngreat help to our country financially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Kallang spoke at great\r\n\r\nlength on how workers should be safeguarded against\r\n\r\naccidents.  I feel that people working in  quarries\r\n\r\nare  risking  their  lives.  So  if  there  are  no\r\n\r\nadequate  safety  measures  in  the  quarries,  the\r\n\r\nworkers are liable to be injured. This Bill  merits\r\n\r\nthe support of all Members of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that there should be regulations to\r\n\r\nimplement this Bill so that the objectives  can  be\r\n\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Bill has not as yet been\r\n\r\npassed and Members are telling me what to put  into\r\n\r\nthe  regulations! I wonder whether they are jumping\r\n\r\nthe  gun, as it were, or barking up the wrong tree,\r\n\r\ntelling me to induce my colleague, the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour, to do this, that and the other. Suffice  it\r\n\r\nto say that we had no Ordinance before.

What these regulations\r\n\r\nwill  be  will  depend really on the conditions  of\r\n\r\nwork  in  the quarries. I doubt whether the figures\r\n\r\ncited by one Member in respect of silicosis can  be\r\n\r\nconfined  merely  to  granite  quarries.   He   has\r\n\r\nmentioned  the  United Kingdom Mines  and  Quarries\r\n\r\nAct.  But  surely conditions in the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nare different. Working in coal mines underground is\r\n\r\nentirely different from working in granite quarries\r\n\r\nabove the ground. Whether or not it should be  made\r\n\r\ncompulsory for granite quarry operators to  provide\r\n\r\ntheir  workers with respiratory masks  will  really\r\n\r\ndepend on the conditions in the quarries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to the Members for giving their\r\n\r\nsupport  to  this Bill and drawing my attention  to\r\n\r\ncertain  aspects  of  it which  might  have  to  be\r\n\r\nimproved  and  amendments passed in the  future.

We have achieved much since  the  days\r\n\r\nwhen  the island was largely jungle and swamp land.\r\n\r\nBoth  low-cost  and luxury buildings rise  skywards\r\n\r\nand  hundreds of acres are being reclaimed from the\r\n\r\nsea.  The  vitality of our citizens, our desire  to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  that  the world  does  not  owe  us  a\r\n\r\nliving,   our   rapid   industrial   and   economic\r\n\r\nadvancement  and  other  factors  have  contributed\r\n\r\ntowards a surge of progress in the last decade, the\r\n\r\nlike  of  which  Singapore  has  not  seen  in  its\r\n\r\nprevious history. In this forward-looking state  of\r\n\r\nmind  and  in our enthusiasm for urban renewal,  we\r\n\r\nmay  wake up one day to find our historic monuments\r\n\r\neither  bulldozed  or  crumbling  to  dust  through\r\n\r\nneglect. As new Singapore is being built,  we  must\r\n\r\nnot  let  the  worthwhile part of  older  Singapore\r\n\r\ndisappear, and the time has therefore come  for  us\r\n\r\nto  take stock of what we have of the past and seek\r\n\r\nto  preserve objects and buildings that will remind\r\n\r\nus of our heritage, even though it be short in span\r\n\r\nof time.

The history\r\n\r\nof our nation is very short. If we count from 1819,\r\n\r\nwe have a short history of 150 years. Last year, we\r\n\r\ncelebrated   our   150th  anniversary.   The   main\r\n\r\nobjective  of  this  Bill is to  preserve  all  the\r\n\r\nworthwhile relics and monuments for the benefit  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, our Prime Minister went on a tour of\r\n\r\nvarious countries.

At Lavender Street, there is a building\r\n\r\ncalled  Chau Chia Kuan. It is dated 1819. In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  it  has a history of more than  150  years.\r\n\r\nThis  building -should be preserved by us. We  know\r\n\r\nthat  there is a temple named Siang Lim Sze at  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh.  Siang  Lim  Temple is  also  a  very  grand\r\n\r\nmonument.

I am glad  to  state\r\n\r\nthat the Committee has submitted its Report to this\r\n\r\nHouse  and has recommended that the amendments  set\r\n\r\nout  in  Appendix 1 thereto be made to the  present\r\n\r\nStanding Orders of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the principal amendments recommended\r\n\r\nconcerns  the  procedure for dealing  with  a  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  may  be  adversely  reported  upon  by   the\r\n\r\nPresidential   Council.   Article   81K   of    the\r\n\r\nConstitution, which came into operation early  this\r\n\r\nyear, provides with some exceptions for Bills which\r\n\r\nhave  been passed by this House to be sent  to  the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Council  for  their  opinion  as   to\r\n\r\nwhether  or not any and, if so, which provision  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  would,  if enacted, be a differentiating\r\n\r\nmeasure  or otherwise inconsistent with  the  funda\r\n\r\nmental liberties of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Council submits an adverse report on a\r\n\r\nBill,  there are two courses which may be taken  if\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenactment  of the Bill is to be pursued. Parliament\r\n\r\nmay  amend  the Bill after which the  Bill  in  its\r\n\r\namended form will be resubmitted to the Council; or\r\n\r\nParliament may, by an affirmative vote of not  less\r\n\r\nthan   two-thirds  of  the  total   membership   of\r\n\r\nParliament,  pass a resolution for the presentation\r\n\r\nof the Bill to the President for his assent. It is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  necessary for the procedure for  either\r\n\r\ncourse  to be written into our Standing Orders  and\r\n\r\nthe  procedure  recommended by the Standing  Orders\r\n\r\nCommittee  is set out in the proposed new  Standing\r\n\r\nOrder at paragraph 20 of Appendix I to the Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on financial procedure a recommendation has\r\n\r\nbeen  made to increase the number of allotted  days\r\n\r\nfor  the consideration of the Main Estimates in the\r\n\r\nCommittee  of Supply from three days as at  present\r\n\r\nto  five days. This should keep some Members happy.\r\n\r\nIn  the previous two Budget sessions the number  of\r\n\r\nallotted  days  for  the  discussion  of  the  Main\r\n\r\nEstimates  was, by resolution, increased  to  five.\r\n\r\nAnd  on both occasions all the five days were taken\r\n\r\nup.  There  is justification, therefore,  for  this\r\n\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Development Estimates, the\r\n\r\nCommittee  has also recommended that the number  of\r\n\r\nallotted  days  for  the  Committee  of  Supply  be\r\n\r\nincreased from one to two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, you will recollect that at the last Budget session a good number of amendments to the Estimates tabled by Members were not reached by want of time. The Committee, therefore, gave some thought to this and has suggested that the time limit for speeches in the Committee of Supply be\r\n\r\nreduced  from the present 15 minutes to 10  minutes\r\n\r\nat  any one time. The number of times a Member  may\r\n\r\nspeak   on   any   question,  of  course,   remains\r\n\r\nunlimited,  it is hoped that this will enable  more\r\n\r\nMembers  to have an opportunity to speak and  raise\r\n\r\nmatters relating to the Estimates and other matters\r\n\r\nconsidered in the Committee of Supply. I might  add\r\n\r\nthat in the Australian House of `Representatives a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember is allowed two periods each not exceeding 10\r\n\r\nminutes  on each question in Committee; a total  of\r\n\r\n20 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At paragraph 27 of Appendix 1to the Committee's\r\n\r\nReport  is  a  new Standing Order setting  out  the\r\n\r\nprocedure  for a Vote of Credit for which provision\r\n\r\nhad  been  made in an amendment to the Constitution\r\n\r\nin 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, 1 would like to refer to\r\n\r\nthe  proposed amendment relating to a debate on the\r\n\r\nMotion  for  the  Adjournment.

Hence, many episodes  of  human\r\n\r\ninterest  have occurred. My constituency  has  been\r\n\r\nselected   as   the  major  area   for   industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment and, therefore, many of my constituents\r\n\r\nare  affected by resettlement. If I do not  mention\r\n\r\nin  this House some of the problems arising out  of\r\n\r\nresettlement of some villages, I will be failing in\r\n\r\nmy duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not deny that resettlement is a thorny problem. It is not just a matter of cutting down fruit trees and dismantling of houses. It also involves the removal of the people and their livestock to another place. This, of course, affects the normal life of the people.\r\n\r\nMost  of the farmers have built up their homesteads\r\n\r\nafter many long years of effort. For them to remove\r\n\r\nelsewhere is, of course, not easy. It is a  painful\r\n\r\nmatter to them. During all these years, our farmers\r\n\r\nhave shown\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreat understanding and have co-operated fully with\r\n\r\nthe Government. Within the stipulated deadline they\r\n\r\nhave bravely put up with great inconveniences. They\r\n\r\nhave parted for good from the homesteads which they\r\n\r\nhave  built up through toil and labour.  They  have\r\n\r\ngone  to the resettlement areas where they have  to\r\n\r\nstart everything afresh. In my opinion, since  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  very co-operative with the  Government.\r\n\r\nThe Government departments concerned should not let\r\n\r\nthem  have  the  worst of it. They should  adopt  a\r\n\r\nsympathetic attitude towards them and,  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible,   try   to   lessen   their   pain    and\r\n\r\ninconvenience. Every assistance should be given  to\r\n\r\nthem  to resume their normal livelihood within  the\r\n\r\nshortest  possible time after they have removed  to\r\n\r\nthe resettlement areas. Otherwise the burden of our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme will fall  mainly  upon\r\n\r\nthem. This is not fair to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the authorities concerned seem to have much\r\n\r\nleeway  in  respect  of  the  time  limit  set  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the delineated  areas.  Sometimes,\r\n\r\ncertain  areas  may he designated  for  development\r\n\r\nsoon.  But  after several years of waiting  by  the\r\n\r\nfarmers, nothing happens. As a result, the affected\r\n\r\nfarmers are in a quandary. The roads in their areas\r\n\r\ndeteriorate  and are never properly repaired.  They\r\n\r\nare  also notified by the authorities not to  carry\r\n\r\non with their agricultural activities. On the other\r\n\r\nhand, the period of waiting sometimes turns out  to\r\n\r\nbe  two  or three years. During this waiting period\r\n\r\nthe farmers generally dare not undertake any large-scale  planting  of  fruit  trees  or  rearing   of\r\n\r\nlivestock. Thus, their income is reduced  and  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  make  use of their savings  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsurvive.  This kind of life is most intolerable  to\r\n\r\nthem.  I  hope the authorities concerned will  give\r\n\r\nthem a definite date for their removal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Jurong Constituency is a developing area. Some parts are already developed. Sometimes, in implementing the development plans, the authorities will choke up the drains, thus causing frequent flooding of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvegetable  gardens  in the surrounding  areas.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  my  constituency  around  Kian   Teck\r\n\r\nVillage  and  Chung  Keng Pah, such  incidents  did\r\n\r\nhappen.  In  order to avoid any losses the  farmers\r\n\r\nhave  reduced their cultivation. Some have gone  to\r\n\r\nlook  for jobs in the Jurong industrial area so  as\r\n\r\nto  supplement their income from farming.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthem have failed in their agricultural pursuits  as\r\n\r\na  result  of  an  epidemic in livestock.  As  they\r\n\r\ncannot  for  the time being secure enough  capital,\r\n\r\nthey  have  to look for some jobs in the industrial\r\n\r\narea in order to maintain their livelihood. The net\r\n\r\nresult  is  that,  after  one  or  two  years,  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  will conduct a census  and  when  they\r\n\r\nfind  that  the farmers' cultivation has  decreased\r\n\r\nand  that someone in the household has gone out  to\r\n\r\ndo  some  odd job, they will transfer the  original\r\n\r\nfarming  household to the register of  non-farmers.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  these people will not be considered  for\r\n\r\nthe  allocation of farm lots. These villagers  live\r\n\r\npartly  by  agriculture and partly by  other  work.\r\n\r\nWhen  they  are required to remove, the  lucky  one\r\n\r\nwill be allotted some 3,000 square feet of land  to\r\n\r\nbuild a house and some will have to go and live  in\r\n\r\nHDB/JTC  flats.  Their new living space  is  small.\r\n\r\nHence,  they have no more opportunity to engage  in\r\n\r\nagricultural activities. If they go and work in the\r\n\r\nindustrial   area,  they  have   to   travel   long\r\n\r\ndistances,   and   this  means   an   increase   in\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  They will, therefore,  lead  an  even\r\n\r\npoorer   life.   The   Government   should    allot\r\n\r\nagricultural lands to these farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the villages, the family unit system is still prevalent. Sometimes, on a piece of land on Temporary Occupation Licence, there may be several households, some on a father-and-son relationship, some on a brother-and-brother relationship, and others are just relatives. Several of the households may be separate and\r\n\r\nindependent.  However, when allocating  lands,  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  in  charge will  not  take  this  into\r\n\r\nconsideration. For one T.O.L., only  one  piece  of\r\n\r\nland will be allotted to the licensee, irrespective\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow many households there are on that piece of land\r\n\r\nat the moment. It has happened that sometimes 30 to\r\n\r\n40  people are resettled on a small piece of  land.\r\n\r\nBut what is even worse is that the authorities have\r\n\r\nstipulated  that  only one dwelling  house  can  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  on  one piece of allotted land. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthese  dwelling houses are not permitted to have  a\r\n\r\nbuilding  area of more than 1,000 square  feet.  It\r\n\r\nrequires little imagination to visualise the  over-crowding and inconvenience when 30 to 40 people are\r\n\r\ncrammed  into  a  house  of 1,000  square  feet.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that,  to be reasonable, each  independent\r\n\r\nhousehold  should be allotted a separate  piece  of\r\n\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Government resettles the farmers, they will receive compensation for having to give up their dwelling houses, pigsties, chicken sheds and fruit trees, etc. However, the rate of compensation is very low. It is usually not enough to build a new house. I have no intention to\r\n\r\nargue   with   the  Minister  on  the   amount   of\r\n\r\ncompensation. However, there are two points in this\r\n\r\nconnection  which are considered most unreasonable.\r\n\r\nThe first relates to the stipulation of the maximum\r\n\r\ncompensation. According to it, the compensation for\r\n\r\nan  acre  of  fruit  trees and other  crops  cannot\r\n\r\nexceed  $1,500. To a diligent farmer this is simply\r\n\r\na  kind of exploitation. It must be understood that\r\n\r\nthese fruit trees and crops are the result of  long\r\n\r\nyears  of toil on the part of the farmers. How  can\r\n\r\nthey  not  be  compensated with a  fair  amount  on\r\n\r\nresettlement?  The  other  point  relates  to   the\r\n\r\ncompensation  for the house. This is based  on  the\r\n\r\nsize  of  the cemented area. It is also  stipulated\r\n\r\nthat,  subject  to  the possession  of  documentary\r\n\r\nevidence  to  show that the house was built  before\r\n\r\nthe  Second World War, or the plans of their  house\r\n\r\nif  built  after  the  war, every  square  foot  of\r\n\r\ncemented  land is to be compensated for  at  $2.50.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  the  compensation is $1.  Sir,  in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas many attap houses had been in existence\r\n\r\nbefore  the war. However, the rural folks  did  not\r\n\r\nknow very much about the cumbersome procedures of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government. So they did not prepare  plans  to\r\n\r\napply  for house numbers. As a result, many farmers\r\n\r\nwhose houses were actually put up before the war or\r\n\r\nwere  built more than ten years ago had to  settle,\r\n\r\nwilly-nilly,  for a much lower rate of compensation\r\n\r\nbecause  they could not produce documents or  plans\r\n\r\nto   prove  such  facts.  In  such  cases,  it   is\r\n\r\nreasonable to accept their claims as true, provided\r\n\r\nthe  village leaders can confirm them and  provided\r\n\r\nthey are countersigned or confirmed by a Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers affected by the scheme are usually\r\n\r\nresettled at far-away places. But this is not  all.\r\n\r\nThe  worst of it is that they cannot rebuild  their\r\n\r\nhomesteads immediately. Some of them are  allocated\r\n\r\nlow-living  areas where they have to spend  several\r\n\r\nthousand dollars of their own money to fill up  the\r\n\r\nland. Some have been resettled in places where  the\r\n\r\noriginal  dwellers are still staying, and this  has\r\n\r\ncaused even more trouble. This has happened because\r\n\r\nthe officers who plan such resettlement merely stay\r\n\r\nin their air-conditioned rooms and have not gone to\r\n\r\nthe spot to see the actual situation of the farmers\r\n\r\nfor  themselves. Sometimes the dwelling houses, the\r\n\r\nchicken  sheds or pigsties of the original dwellers\r\n\r\nhappen  to appear on the demarcation lines or  have\r\n\r\nbeen  given  to others, thus putting  the  original\r\n\r\ndwellers  in a dilemma. It has often happened  that\r\n\r\nbefore  the compensation for the affected  property\r\n\r\nof the original dwellers has been properly settled,\r\n\r\nthe  same  land is allocated to new settlers,  thus\r\n\r\ncausing no end of confusion to the old and the  new\r\n\r\ndwellers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what troubles the farmers in the resettlement areas even more is that when they have been resettled in a place for not more than a few years, they are requested to remove to another place. In every removal they will incur great losses and suffer inconvenience. I am against this\r\n\r\nmoving  from place to place. This puts the  farmers\r\n\r\nin  a  very  distressing and helpless position.  At\r\n\r\ntimes after they have been resettled they will, all\r\n\r\nof  a  sudden, receive a notice saying  that  their\r\n\r\npigsties and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchicken  sheds will have to be demolished in  order\r\n\r\nto  make  way for the building of a new road.  They\r\n\r\nhave  to  pull down the structures which they  have\r\n\r\nput  up. This upsets them very much. All this  goes\r\n\r\nto  show that there has not been prior planning  in\r\n\r\nresettlement.  Moreover, the resettlement  problems\r\n\r\nhave not been considered carefully in advance. Many\r\n\r\nfarmers  have  been  asked to resettle  on  another\r\n\r\noccasion, causing great losses and inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to request the Minister to study for\r\n\r\nhimself  the  plans for resettlement so  that  such\r\n\r\nthings do not happen again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to another matter. Many rural people\r\n\r\nare  religious  and there are many temples  in  the\r\n\r\nareas   affected  by  resettlement.  In   the   new\r\n\r\nresettlement areas, there is no provision  of  land\r\n\r\nfor   the   building   of  temples.   Some   temple\r\n\r\nmanagements,  after lengthy negotiations  with  the\r\n\r\nauthorities,  were fortunate enough  to  get  small\r\n\r\nplots  of  land  allotted to them. To  these  rural\r\n\r\npeople, religion is a part of their lives, and this\r\n\r\nlack of land is most inconvenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what amazes me is that no reservation\r\n\r\nhas  been  made  for sites in the new  resettlement\r\n\r\nareas  for  educational  purposes.  Many  resettled\r\n\r\nfarmers have been troubled by the problem of  their\r\n\r\nchildren's  education.  The Government  should  not\r\n\r\nthink   that  once  the  farmers  are  successfully\r\n\r\nresettled,  the  undertaking is completed  and  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood,  education, recreation,  etc.,  of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  can  be  disregarded. I assert  that  this\r\n\r\nattitude is not correct. In Resettlement Areas  117\r\n\r\nand  118  the  situation is thus. The  settlers  in\r\n\r\nthese  two  resettlement  areas  came  mainly  from\r\n\r\nLokyang  Village in my constituency. The Management\r\n\r\nCommittee  of Lokyang School, which was  originally\r\n\r\nin  Lokyang  Village were notified that the  school\r\n\r\nwould   be   demolished.  They   applied   to   the\r\n\r\nauthorities for a lot in the resettlement area  and\r\n\r\nmade  preparations  to remove  to  the  new  school\r\n\r\nbuilding.  At the same time, local keen  supporters\r\n\r\nof  the  cause of education also set  up  a  school\r\n\r\nbuilding   committee.  But  this   enthusiasm   for\r\n\r\neducation on the part of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  villagers  did not meet with any encouragement\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government. They did not  even  allot  a\r\n\r\npiece  of  land for a school. The schools near  the\r\n\r\nresettlement area already have a full enrolment and\r\n\r\nsettlers  are  continually  being  added   to   the\r\n\r\nsettlement. I really do not know where the children\r\n\r\nof  these  settlers will go for their schooling.  I\r\n\r\nrequest   the   Minister  to  give  the   House   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present farmers who are not yet affected\r\n\r\nby  resettlement have two to three acres of land on\r\n\r\nan   average   which   is  used  for   agricultural\r\n\r\ncultivation  or  livestock rearing  or  both.  They\r\n\r\nmobilize  all hands in the family and  utilize  all\r\n\r\nthe  available  land. In this way, they  manage  to\r\n\r\nscrape  up three meals a day. When they are removed\r\n\r\nto  the  resettlement areas, they are allotted  not\r\n\r\nmore  than  one and a half acres of land.  A  great\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the households get only  one-half  or\r\n\r\nthree-quarters of an acre of land. When the area of\r\n\r\narable land is reduced, the amount harvested  will,\r\n\r\nof  course,  be  reduced proportionately.  Further,\r\n\r\nthere  will  not be a harvest rightaway.  If  fruit\r\n\r\ntrees  are planted, it will take several years  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  bear  fruit.  If the  income  from  their\r\n\r\nagricultural activities is not enough  to  maintain\r\n\r\ntheir  livelihood, members of the family seek  work\r\n\r\nin the industrial areas. Then, in view of the great\r\n\r\ndistances   travelled,  after  deducting  transport\r\n\r\nexpenses,  the income received will still  be  very\r\n\r\nlimited. The farmers who are resettled not only get\r\n\r\na   reduced   income  but  also   incur   increased\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  Because a house is  newly  built,  it\r\n\r\nwill attract a higher annual assessment value.  The\r\n\r\nproperty  tax  is thereby increased. To  settle  in\r\n\r\nsome  far-away place, the farmers have to pay  more\r\n\r\non transport expenses than before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, sanitary amenities will have to be\r\n\r\ninstalled, hygienic pigsties and chicken sheds have\r\n\r\nto be built, better breeds of livestock and farming\r\n\r\nimplements have to be bought. All these need money.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  school nearby is full up,  the  children\r\n\r\nwill have to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsent  to  far-away places for schooling,  and  more\r\n\r\ntransport expenses will be incurred. It can be said\r\n\r\nthat  the  farmers,  who are  already  poor,  after\r\n\r\nmoving  to the resettlement area, will become  even\r\n\r\npoorer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ours is a country which professes democratic\r\n\r\nsocialism  and advocates the narrowing of  the  gap\r\n\r\nbetween  the  rich and the poor. Judging  from  the\r\n\r\ndistressed   condition   of   dwellers    in    the\r\n\r\nresettlement  areas, the gap between the  rich  and\r\n\r\nthe  poor has grown wider. The Government seems not\r\n\r\nto  care  for the farmers. It seems to be satisfied\r\n\r\nwith merely rapidly removing the farmers from their\r\n\r\nhomesteads and allotting the sites thus vacated  to\r\n\r\nforeign capitalists for investment. The authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned  seem not to have planned  and  developed\r\n\r\nthe  resettlement areas well to make them  suitable\r\n\r\nfor   people  to  live  in  and  enjoy  the  modern\r\n\r\namenities   of  life.  The  Government   has   been\r\n\r\nvociferous  in  claiming that it is much  concerned\r\n\r\nwith  the welfare of the resettlement dwellers.  It\r\n\r\nshould not merely pay lip-service to it, but should\r\n\r\nshow its concern for them in practical terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, regarding the problems mentioned  at\r\n\r\nlength by the Member for Jurong, my feeling is that\r\n\r\nthey are general resettlement problems and only one\r\n\r\nor  two  deserve  an answer. All the  rest  can  be\r\n\r\nsolved    administratively   by   the   departments\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to data collected by the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department, there are about 19,000 farms\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been  licensed. The number  of  people\r\n\r\nengaged in farming is about 180,000, of which those\r\n\r\nwho  are  engaged in full-time farming number  only\r\n\r\n36,000,  those engaged in part-time farming  number\r\n\r\n14,000,  and  those not engaged in  farming  number\r\n\r\n23,000.  The  rest are women and  children.  If  we\r\n\r\nclassify  the farms according to their  sizes,  the\r\n\r\nsmall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfarms  comprise  about 85 per cent. The rest are medium-sized  farms.  By  small\r\n\r\nfarms I mean those which have less than 100 pigs or less than 1,000chickens,  or\r\n\r\nfarms  which are partly engaged in other farming activities. According to  these\r\n\r\ndata,  most  of the farmers on the small farms are part-time farmers.  Meantime,\r\n\r\nthey  are  also  engaged in other activities to maintain  their  livelihood.  As\r\n\r\nregards  these  small farmers, whether or not they are affected by resettlement,\r\n\r\nthey are still part-time farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has alleged that these farmers have become poor because\r\n\r\nof resettlement. This is incorrect. However, I do not deny that when a farmer is\r\n\r\nresettled  in  a  new area, he will have to put up with some  inconvenience  and\r\n\r\nhardship.  My  department understands very well the existence of these  problems\r\n\r\nand  we have always given these farmers our careful attention. We have tried our\r\n\r\nbest to reduce their difficulties in building their new homesteads. This is  the\r\n\r\nexperience we have gathered over the years and, as a matter of fact, because  of\r\n\r\nour  enlightened  and  reasonable  attitude  in  tackling  these  problems,  our\r\n\r\nresettlement  policy  has been carried out smoothly. I do not  agree  completely\r\n\r\nwith  the  Member  for  Jurong  when  he says  that  in  the  implementation  of\r\n\r\nresettlement,  certain aberrations exist. In point of fact, the selection  of  a\r\n\r\nresettlement area is dependent on a number of factors. The most important factor\r\n\r\nis  that  the  selected site must conform with the utilisation of  the  area  as\r\n\r\nspecified  by  the  Master Plan for Singapore. The majority of the  resettlement\r\n\r\nareas  are delineated in the Lim Chu Kang and Choa Chu Kang areas. That  is  the\r\n\r\nreason why farmers from Jurong must be resettled in these areas. But what  I  am\r\n\r\nworried  about is that once we have used up these areas, we have to  review  the\r\n\r\npolicy of reallocation of land for farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has also alleged that certain farmers were resettled for\r\n\r\na  second  time. These are the facts. When we were in Malaysia, the  problem  of\r\n\r\nnational defence was in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of  the  central  Government. When we became  independent,  national\r\n\r\ndefence became our primary concern. En order to train our Army, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nDefence  required  large areas of land for training purposes. Because  of  this,\r\n\r\ncertain rural areas, including certain resettlement areas, were affected by this\r\n\r\nplan.  Actually,  resettlement  is  not an  easy  task.  Sometimes,  because  of\r\n\r\npractical  necessity,  we  are  compelled to carry  out  resettlement.  Strictly\r\n\r\nspeaking,  our resettlement department can be said to be an agency  for  various\r\n\r\nGovernment departments in clearing out areas designated for development so  that\r\n\r\nall  our  national development projects may be carried out smoothly. If one  day\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing for the resettlement department to do, then  our  development\r\n\r\nwill also come to a stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong is unhappy about the reallocation of land for farmers\r\n\r\nand  about the maximum compensation of $1,500 per acre of fruit trees.  Sir,  on\r\n\r\nthe  question of reallocation of land, our policy is this. If the  person  is  a\r\n\r\ngenuine farmer, he will get between half an acre and two acres of land. As  land\r\n\r\nis   becoming  increasingly  scarce  in  our  country,  there  must  be  certain\r\n\r\nlimitations  imposed on our policy of reallocation of land. On the  question  of\r\n\r\nthe  maximum compensation of $1,500 per acre of fruit trees, this figure is much\r\n\r\nhigher than that prevailing before 1964. The maximum compensation is based  upon\r\n\r\nthe  maximum number of fruit trees which can be cultivated in an acre  of  land.\r\n\r\nThe  fixing  of  the maximum figure also ensures that corruption does  not  take\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in regard to compensation for buildings, if the owner can produce\r\n\r\ndocumentary  evidence  to  show that he has followed  legitimate  procedures  in\r\n\r\napplying  for  building approval, he will receive compensation at  the  rate  of\r\n\r\n$2.50  per square foot. In addition, I wish to mention that special cases  which\r\n\r\nwere  brought before the relevant department by Members of Parliament have  been\r\n\r\ngiven special consideration after due investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the problems of damage to roads, blocked drains and larger houses\r\n\r\nfor  farmers, all these problems can be solved administratively by  the  various\r\n\r\ndepartments concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although our resettlement areas cannot be compared with those under the Housing and Development Board, at least most of them do have roads, drains and supplies of water and electricity. Furthermore, a certain portion of the resettlement area is set aside for schools and other purposes. However, the construction of schools is not the responsibility of the resettlement department. If the Ministry of Education can support the building\r\n\r\nof  schools in the resettlement area, then our resettlement department  will  be\r\n\r\nwilling to offer assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of temples, those which were affected by resettlement projects\r\n\r\nhave been relocated in various resettlement areas. There are also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity centres in these resettlement areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, I wish to point out that for the last few years our\r\n\r\nfarmers, under the care of our Government, have made a considerable contribution\r\n\r\nto our country. As a result of the rapid expansion of our economy and the growth\r\n\r\nof  industrialisation, it is true that a certain number  of  farmers  have  been\r\n\r\naffected by resettlement. But, on the whole, our farmers have contributed to our\r\n\r\nGross  National Product to the tune of 2.9 per cent. In terms of monetary value,\r\n\r\ntheir annual production exceeds $100 million. This, then, is the fact which goes\r\n\r\nto  show  that  the picture painted by the Member for Jurong is based  upon  his\r\n\r\nsubjective point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Fourteen minutes to Seven o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1970/19701104/19701104-HA-0300359.pdf\"\">COMPARISON OF THE EXISTING AND NEW NATIONAL SERVICE POLICY (cols. 359-368)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
