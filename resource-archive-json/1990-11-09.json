Today, it costs about $20 million to build and equip a standard single-session secondary school. Aided schools would have to raise at least $4 million or more to meet their share of the cost.

With your permission, I would like to answer both of them together. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> The reason for a time-based system for charging telephone calls is to have a fairer system for all subscribers and users. This fairer system will lead to more efficient use of our telephone networks and, in the longer term, keep the cost of telephone services in Singapore down. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present flat-rate rental system, those who hardly use their phones pay exactly the same rate as those who use their phones extensively. What that means is that the former subsidises the latter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecom has done a survey. Which shows that 10% of the heaviest business users account for 34% of all the business traffic. At the other extreme, 10% of the lowest users account for only 0.1% of the traffic. In other words, the heavy users use the telephone services 340 times that of the low users. There are similar figures of disproportionate usage among the residential subscribers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present flat-rate telephone rental system was designed for voice communication. But as more and more non-voice communication becomes available, for example, the transmission of data, fax transmissions, and becomes more widespread and is used by both businesses as well as residences, then this distortion of usage becomes even greater. That is why the present flat-rate rental system is both unfair and inappropriate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The telephone traffic in Singapore has been growing annually at a rate of about \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 6% for residential subscribers and 11% for business subscribers over the past five years. With increased traffic, more investment in telephone networks and exchanges becomes necessary. If we continue with this flat-rate rental, where everybody pays exactly the same, then what it means is that the low users will have to subsidise the heavy users even more in future, because the cost of investing in these new infrastructures will have to be recovered evenly from everybody. This is obviously not fair since it will penalise severely the low users who are in the majority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, paying for what we use according to usage is not something new. Indeed, It is something that we do all the time, every day. We pay for our consumption of electricity based on the quantity of electricity that we use. If we use less, we pay less. If we use more, we pay more. We pay for our water, petrol, food, bus rides and MRT rides, all on that same basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is true that moving from a fixed rate rental system for telephone services to a usage-based system is new for us in Singapore. Other countries have gone that way. In most developed countries and cities they have adopted the usage charge. At 1.5 cents per minute, our rates are amongst the lowest in the world. Sir, with your permission, I would like to circulate for Members' reference a table (Cols. 659 - 660) showing the rates that other countries charge. [Copies of Table circulated to hon. Members]. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1990/19901109/19901109-HA-0560659.htm\">table - SOME COUNTRIES WITH USAGE SENSITIVE CHARGING (Cols. 659 - 660)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members would see from the table that the charge of 1.5 cents per minute is very low compared to what some cities in other countries charge. And 1.5 cents is less than half of what we charge for the public telephones where one pays 10 cents for every 3 minutes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chin has asked about emergency calls to the Police and to other public authorities. I want to assure him that the emergency calls, such as those to the Police, the Fire Service and the Ambulance Service, will not be charged when such \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> calls are made. Indeed, the practice in many countries is that with the usage system, many companies and organisations offer free telephone calls because this service becomes part and parcel of their marketing strategies. I am sure the same trend will take place in Singapore in due course. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on another point raised by Mr Chin, the number of households in Singapore who do not have a telephone is very small. They probably consider the present rate of $190 per year too high relative to the usage that they expect. With the present changeover to a usage-based system, it is probable that some of them may find the rates which have been halved much more attractive. This is an added advantage, an added bonus, for charging by usage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point about public telephones, Singapore already has the highest number of public telephones per thousand people. With 27,000 public telephones all over the island, the public has no difficulty having access to a phone. All the same, Telecom will continue to put up more public phones wherever there is a need for them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand the concern expressed by some of the subscribers when the announcement of the change in charging system was made. Any major change can be upsetting and unsettling even if it is a change for the better. One of the reasons why Singapore is successful is that we have always made adjustments to changing circumstances and our population has always adapted to the changes. That has been one of our key strengths in Singapore. Hence, I would like to encourage Singaporeans to be patient. They will be pleasantly surprised next year when the switch is made that their telephone bills will be less than what they feared; The majority of subscribers will find that their telephone bills will be less than what they are presently paying. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the new charging system has stabilised, when it is implemented in the fourth quarter of next year, Telecom will monitor the traffic patterns. If there are peaks and troughs in the traffic pattern, I will ask Telecom to consider the possibility \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of giving a discount for off-peak traffic. In other words, if you were to use the telephone in the evening, when the traffic is light, we can consider a discount. This will further lower the telephone bills for our residential subscribers. It will also help make even greater and more efficient use of the costly investment that we have made in our telephone network. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights):</b> Sir, does the Minister agree with the following observations: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That telephone users in general have no complaints about the present system. Cross-subsidisation, yes, but overall, everybody enjoys lower charges and nobody, except maybe Telecom, complains about the so-called unfairness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) By changing to the time-based system and going by Telecom's statistics, about 40% of all the users will face increases in their telephone bills. These increases in the business sector --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Goh, can you please ask your question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> I am asking whether the Minister agrees with these observations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Your observations are rather long ones. Could you please frame your question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> I would like to ask whether the Minister agrees that the increase in the business sector will inevitably in the end be passed on to the consumers and, therefore, the public as a whole will be worse off rather than they will benefit from the new system. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions because it provides an opportunity for further amplification. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member says that subscribers have no complaints and therefore we should leave things be. Sir, that is the surest way for Singapore to go down the tube, which is to make no changes when circumstances have changed. True, up until now, subscribers have not made any complaints. But as I pointed out, the traffic volume of telephone calls is increasing. What that means is that Telecom will have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to add more networks, more switches, more telephone lines, more optical fibres and so on, and when that happens the flat rate rental to all subscribers will have to be increased. If we do not make the change to a different system, and when we announce an increase in the telephone rates, then the public will get very upset. But that increase will be unjustified for those who are presently low users. That is why we have to make the change now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me illustrate in a slightly different way to show why the flat-rate rental system is inappropriate in the new circumstances that we are entering. At the moment, practically every household in Singapore has got a telephone. There are no charges put on the individual subscriber for international calls. If we had operated a flat-rate rental system for international calls, then all subscribers today would probably have to pay another $100-$200 per year. What we have to do is to add up the total cost of having international calls and divide it evenly by the million subscribers that we have in Singapore. So multi-nationals who make thousands of dollars worth of calls each month will be subsidized by all the domestic subscribers who do not use their telephones at all for international calls. That would be the consequence of operating a flat-rate rental system if we had used that system for international calls. Sir, I would like to ask the Member whether that is fair. Obviously, not. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member mentioned another point that we should not make a change because some of the businesses will have to pay more for telephone charges. True. But 60% of the businesses will pay less. The objective is not to go for an increase in revenue for Telecom, but to change the rate structure such that the final revenue is about the same. So whilst some businesses will have to pay more, others will have to pay less. So it should even itself out without any additional cost increases to be passed on to consumers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> In view of the Minister's very strong and rational arguments for a time-based system, would Telecom go completely into a time-based system for domestic services and thereby in future probably eliminate \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> completely the flat-rate system for domestic services? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, I take the Member's suggestion of going completely to a usage-based system to mean that there will be no charge at all even when a subscriber has a telephone in his house. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> That is right. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, that is possible. But this time it will be unfair the other way round. I will explain why. To have a telephone in a subscriber's house, Telecom has got to invest in physical infrastructure, including all the telephone lines to his house. That has to be amortised and paid for, and the flat-rate rental is the amount of money that he has got to pay for the entire infrastructure. If you go for zero-base charge and, raise the charges from 1.5 cents per minute to a few cents per minute, say, 3 or 4 or 5 cents, whatever the number works out to be, then what happens is that the heavy users will now end up subsidizing the low users because now the heavy users will have to pay for all the infrastructure which the low users enjoy as they use their telephones sparingly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Fengshan):</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what is the cost of putting in place the infrastructure to effect the change to this new billing system and what percentage of the 1.5 cents goes towards the infrastructure? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, I do not have the figures for that at the moment, but it is in the order of a few million dollars. In the context of Telecom's overall revenue of approximately $2,000 million a year, that expenditure of a few million dollars, spread over a large number of years, is negligible. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> Sir, the second part of my question refers to the percentage of what we would pay for a time-based call. What percentage of that would go towards manning the infrastructure? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, It is insignificant. It is extremely small. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, I do not think there is much \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> quarrel with the principle of the new charges and the new system, but it's really the rates. May I ask the Minister, if the revenue of Telecom has increased after this new system, since he said that it is revenue-neutral, whether he would consider lowering the rates once he finds out that Telecom has actually made extra revenue from this new system? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, if there are savings as a result of productivity gains as a result of this more efficient system, Telecom will certainly consider the possibility of passing that savings back to the subscribers. Indeed, that has been the policy of Telecom all these years. For the last 12 years, Telecom has passed back a total of $2,400 million. Indeed, recently, Telecom has just passed back another $23 million back to the subscribers - cheaper rates for pagers, cheaper rates for IDD and the other services. That has always been the practice of Telecom. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I wish the Minister will answer the question directly. My question is: Would Telecom reduce the rates once he has found that the new system generates more revenue, since the new system is meant to be revenue-neutral? I think the words \"revenue-neutral\" were used by Telecom. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, I have answered that question directly. If there are gains as a result of this change, Telecom will reduce the rates. But we must remember this. When you are talking about an organisation like Telecom, you are not talking about a static organisation. You are talking about an organisation will be investing billions of dollars over the next five-year period, and that investment will result in even greater productivity gains. I am saying that when there are even more productivity gains, those productivity gains will be passed back to the subscribers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether he considers there are any differences between decreases in cost due to productivity gains and increases in revenue due to the difference in the system of charging? In any case, would the Minister not agree with me that if Telecom can come out with such a complicated system which is completely \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> different from the present system, and pronounced to the world that it is revenue-neutral as far as Telecom is concerned, it should not be too difficult to come out with a monitoring system to show whether it has actually increased the revenue or not through the new system. I am not disputing his answer on the point about productivity gains. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, I do understand the Member's point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me sketch out a scenario for the Member. If Telecom sits down and does nothing, it can monitor the performance of the system after we have changed over from the present flat-rate system to a usage-charged system. But I certainly do not anticipate, in fact I will not allow, Telecom to sit and do nothing. I do not think Singaporeans want a Telecom that does not make any progress. So after the changeover has taken place, there will continue to be investments made. The investments will improve the quality of telephone services in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member is a banker and he knows that our telephone communication system is second-to-none in terms of its cost for financial transactions worldwide and in helping Singapore maintain its position as a financial centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, with your indulgence, may I clarify with the Minister on just one point? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Could you ask your supplementary question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Yes Sir, but by putting some supplementary points in question form, the Minister may not understand me. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was a banker. But I am not a banker right now. But, Sir, what I am saying is that since Telecome has said that the system is revenue-neutral, surely Telecom has the means of monitoring whether the new system will generate more revenue or whether the existing system will generate more revenue. And if, based on usage, the new system generates more revenue, then I am asking that Telecom, to be truthful to its original intention, should reduce the rates so that it will be revenue-neutral. And \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> it is not difficult, Sir, to put up such a system. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, the short answer to that question is yes. But it is like saying that all things being equal, the answer will be yes. But we all know that all things are not going to be equal. I just mentioned to him that I will not allow Telecom to sit and do nothing and just to monitor the figures so that we can provide him with the figures over the next three years after the change-over has taken place and say, \"There you are, the figures show that there has been an increase in revenue and here we are, we give you back the rebates.\" I am saying that we do more than that. I am saying that we continue to invest in infrastructure and continue to invest in the latest switches, optical fibres and exchanges. And wherever there are productivity gains, wherever there are decreases in cost and increases in revenue, these will be passed back to the subscribers, just as Telecom has been doing it for the last 12 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tiong Bahru GRC):</b> Sir, I share the sentiments of Mr Heng.

I think I would like to have an answer to the question of revenue and not the overall problem about productivity and expenses. May I ask the Minister whether it is impossible for Telecom to come up with a system where they can monitor both the revenue for the next year based on the existing system and on the new system? Is it impossible to do that, Sir? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, as I said, the short answer is yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>INFLATION RATE FOR 1990</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Forecast)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is his forecast of the inflation rate for 1990 and how his Ministry is monitoring the price increases of essential services. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the first nine months of 1990, the average inflation rate was 3.4%. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) expects the inflation rate for the whole of 1990 to be between 3.6% and 3.7%. This is higher than Singapore's rate in recent years, but is still among the lowest in the world. We have been able to cushion ourselves to some extent from the effects of the Gulf crisis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other NIEs expect inflation rates of between 5% and 10%. Among the developed countries, only the Netherlands, Japan and West Germany expect inflation rates of below 3%. Even among the oil-producing countries in the region, inflation will be higher this year than last year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI monitors the prices of essential commodities through monthly returns from traders. These commodities include petrol, rice and other basic foodstuffs. The Department of Statistics also monitors prices of a wide range of goods and services through mail enquiries and field \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> work. Apart from keeping tabs on prices, MTI monitors the impact that price changes have on business operating costs and on general inflation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a free market economy, prices of all goods and services are set by the market. The best way to hold prices down is not to control prices, but to ensure that sufficient supplies are available, and that no cartels or monopolies can corner the market. This MTI is doing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If world energy prices go up, so will domestic energy costs. When oil prices rise, costs of bus, taxi and MRT fares, electricity and gas tariffs also have to rise. Singapore imports all our oil, and has no domestic sources of energy. Every $1 increase in oil prices means that Singaporeans as a whole are poorer off by $60 million per year. Oil prices have risen by more than $20 in the last year, and so we are collectively $1.2 billion poorer off each year. Higher inflation is just the way this unpleasant fact manifests itself. But so long as we remain competitive, we can keep up economic growth, and in time make up for this temporary drop in our standard of living. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HUMAN ORGAN DONATION AND TRANSPLANT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. \n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh</b> asked the Acting Minister for Health, in view of the scarcity of human organs and the difficulties encountered to carry out organ transplants in Singapore, if he has plans to amend the existing laws in order to facilitate availability of all types of human organs (namely, heart, liver and other organs in addition to kidneys) from cadavers to benefit the very ill patients who need such organ transplants for survival. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Acting Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Human Organ Transplant Act was enacted in 1987, my Ministry, together with the National Kidney Foundation, launched an extensive publicity programme on organ donation and transplant.

Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Third time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not propose to restate all the arguments and the reasons for this Bill for that would be burdening the House with a repetition of arguments which have been presented on more than one occasion. In fact, we have had two Second Readings of this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if I may just recapitulate quickly, the purpose of the Bill is preventive, to nip problems in the bud. It is to prevent matters from escalating and creating tensions, frictions and conflicts between different religious groups. Fortunately, the majority in each religious group in Singapore are conscious of the need to be tolerant and sensitive in our multi-racial society, parti- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> cularly in the manner they go about practising their faith and persuading others to join them. The problems are usually caused by a small number of people who are either insensitive, thoughtless, irresponsible or worse mischievous, and these few people must not be allowed to jeopardise the precious religious harmony that we have maintained all these years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full and detailed rationale for the Bill was set out in the White Paper on the \"Maintenance of Religious Harmony\" presented to this House in December 1989. That White Paper also had a compilation of actual incidents in Singapore which illustrated that the kinds of problems which the Bill addresses are real problems and not academic. We have had a full debate on the Second Reading in February this year on an earlier identical Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During that Second Reading, Sir, I said that the views expressed in this House would be considered carefully. In referring the Bill to a Select Committee, I also said that the Government did not take the position that the Bill could not be improved. I welcomed suggestions which could improve the Bill, ideas that could make the Bill more workable, practical and effective. I also said that this must be within certain parameters. The Bill must be a mechanism that enables us to nip problems in the bud and enables quick, prompt and pre-emptive action. I also reminded colleagues that this is not a law to decide religious issues or theological issues. It is a law to ensure public order and to deal with people whose actions can threaten religious harmony. I also listed as another parameter that such matters have to be decided by the Executive and are not matters to be decided either by the religious groups or by the judges. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, Sir, intend to focus on the Report of the Select Committee and on the amendments made to the Bill by the Committee. Members will know from the Report that the Committee received some 79 written representations, the majority of which were in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the nearly 20 amendments which the Select Committee has made to the Bill, it must be clear to Members that the Committee has made a serious effort to address the valid concerns expressed to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Committee. The Committee did not just confine themselves to the views put forth by the representors. They also took into account views expressed in this House. Let me give you some examples. Mr Chandra Das suggested that the term \"Prohibition Order\" should be changed to \"Restraining Order\" and this has been accepted. Dr Dixie Tan proposed that while the provision on the secrecy of the proceedings of the Presidential Council might be retained, she advocated that the final recommendation of the Council ought to be published. This has also been accepted. Dr John Chen urged that the practice of the Minister consulting Cabinet would be usefully incorporated in the law and this has been accepted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now proceed to discuss the amendments made by the Select Committee. The detailed reasons for the amendments are set out clearly and I would not repeat them. I would categorise the main amendments under the following. First, amendments which address concerns that the Bill frames the individual Minister's powers in rather excessive terms and that there should be additional safeguards. The second category of amendments are those which dealt with concerns that clause 8 of the Bill has language which is subjective in nature and might give rise to difficulties. Third, amendments concerned with the composition of the proposed Presidential Council for Religious Harmony. Fourth, amendments designed to improve the procedures to be followed before the making of an order and after the order is made. The fifth category of amendments are those which dealt with so-called gaps in the original Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the first category, ie, concerns that the Bill was drafted in such a way that the Minister's powers may seem absolute or excessive and that there should be additional safeguards. During the Second Reading in this House, some Members expressed concerns that on such a potentially delicate and sensitive matter as religion, it should not appear that a single Minister has absolute or excessive powers, especially since the Bill also provided that the merits of the decision would not be reviewable in the Courts. A variation of this concern was that a difficult \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> situation may arise when a Minister may have to act on a complaint by a religious group to which he himself belonged. In that situation, even if he had ample grounds to act, some may believe that there was a likelihood of bias. Some of the written representations also echoed these concerns. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had pointed out that in actual practice, no Minister acted alone isolated from Cabinet. Dr John Chen proposed that the reference to Cabinet could be written into the Bill. I said I would be prepared to consider this and I also referred to the model of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act under which the procedure is the Minister first makes the order, it is referred to an Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee makes its recommendation whereupon the President must confirm the order, acting on the advice of the Cabinet. I assured the House that we would discuss this. The Select Committee did take this into account in making a major change to the process of making an order. Under the original Bill, the Minister makes the order. After he has received the representations of the individual and religious organisation, he has to have regard to their views. Likewise, after the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony gives its views, the original Bill prescribes that the Minister would make the decision whether to modify or rescind the order. This has now been revised by the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the revised procedure, the Minister makes the order in the first instance after sending the Notice to the individual. There is no change there. However, the change is that all orders must be confirmed by the President within 30 days of receipt of the report of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony. If the order is not confirmed, it will lapse. The change also is that the President acts on Cabinet's advice except where, as would be provided in the Constitution, Cabinet's advice is contrary to the recommendation of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony, in which case, the President, acting in his discretion, can refuse to confirm the order. This would be consistent with the proposed safeguard role of the Elected President in the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3) \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Bill which is before the House and this will take effect after that amendment is enacted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This important change achieves several objectives. First, it is not just the Minister, but the entire Cabinet which is involved in confirming the order. It formalises what invariably takes place in practice. If I may remind colleagues, Cabinet comprises Ministers belonging to many different faiths. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second advantage is that the President is involved, and the third objective is that it takes into account the proposed additional safeguard role for the Elected President in regard to this Bill. The effect of this is that the recommendations of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony cannot be lightly ignored by the Minister and Cabinet. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category of amendments are those which address the concern of the element of subjectivity in clause 8. In this regard I will just refer to two amendments. First, the deletion of the phrase in clause 8(1)(a) \"prejudicing the maintenance of harmony\". This has been deleted and it will meet the concern of those who felt the subjective element in clause 8(1)(a) should be reduced. Likewise, in clause 8(1)(d) the amendment which establishes a nexus between the concept of exciting disaffection and the abuse of religion would meet the concerns of those who felt that that limb was too wide. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category of amendments is connected with the composition of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony. There was a host of ideas and suggestions about the provisions relating to the Presidential Council. The Committee has accepted quite a number of these proposals, for example, there should be a minimum number stipulated, two-thirds of the members should be representatives of religious groups, the terms of office of the Council members ought to be varied subject to a minimum of one year, so that there would be continuity, ie, the whole Council would not be vacated at the same time. Fourthly, there is provision for qualifications and disqualifications for Council \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> members which are modelled on the provisions of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights. Provision for a quorum is another example. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth category of amendments are those designed to improve the procedures to be followed both before and after an order is made. Amendments in this category are, first, a new provision that when the Minister sends the Notice to the individual of the intention to issue an order, it should be accompanied by grounds and allegations of fact. Secondly, a new provision that the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony is empowered to hear individuals in person if they consider it necessary. Thirdly, every order should be reviewed at least once a year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the fifth category of amendments, several representors thought that in certain respects, there were gaps in the Bill and the Select Committee has made amendments to address these concerns. First, it was pointed out that clause 9 of the Bill was not complete because it did not cover a situation where an individual who was not a member of any religious group, through conduct or speech, nevertheless, caused enmity, hatred, etc, between different religious groups. So an amendment is made to clause 9. Likewise, it was pointed out that the original Bill provided for the Presidential Council for Minority Rights to be involved in the appointment of members of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony. But there is no such mention with regard to removal. This is now taken care of by an amendment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those are some of the amendments which I have touched on. I should also point out, as stated in the Report, that although it was a general principle, which was emphasised during the Second Reading, that the method to tackle this problem cannot be judicial review or to be left to the Court, quite a number of representors made representations advocating that the final recourse should be with the Courts. Opportunity has been taken by the Select Committee to set out in a fairly detailed manner all the reasons why the Select Committee considered that this ought not be the solution. These reasons are fully spelt out in the Select Committee \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Report and it is unnecessary for me to repeat them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may conclude. What we have in this Bill is really a mechanism which has been crafted to deal with the kind of problems that I summarised at the beginning of my speech. Of course, we can deal with such persons with other legislation that exists. We can take them to the courts, prosecute them, have a criminal conviction, or if their actions are more grave, even to deal with them under the Internal Security Act. But in most cases, a less severe, more limited, measure may suffice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, preserving religious harmony is not just a high sounding goal for us in Singapore. I think it is crucial for our survival as a nation. We are young, we are a small nation with people from many races, religions and languages. We can ill-afford to have religious or racial strife or conflicts which plagued other countries. Just consider the very sad situation in India where many have died and suffered - both Muslims and Hindus - over the dispute concerning the construction of a Hindu Temple in Ayodhya on the site where a mosque now stands. In the last General Elections in 1989, a Hindu-revivalist political party campaigned for the removal of constitutional safeguards for Muslims and that India should be established as a Hindu state. After the elections, the party further exploited the issue to garner political support from the Hindus and proposed to demolish the mosque, built more than 500 years ago, and to build a new Hindu temple. Thus, the dispute not only pitted religious group against religious group, but also was made into a political issue with all the resulting disastrous consequences. The national unity of that country has been threatened. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We here cannot and should not judge the merits of that problem. But I am sure all in this House and all Singaporeans will agree with me when I say that we must never allow that to happen here. Imagine that nearly a hundred thousand people had been detained. Imagine such a strife and conflict taking place in Singapore, in our tiny Republic. Where would we find places to detain so many thousands of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> people? And if it takes place here, would Singapore ever be the same again after such a conflict? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the answers are obvious. Religious harmony and racial harmony are far too important for us and we cannot take things for granted. The Bill therefore is a preventive measure which we should put in place. I would say that the best case scenario is that no occasion arises where we need to invoke this Bill. But if one day some individuals, irresponsible or just thoughtless or mischievous, embark on a reckless conduct which can threaten religious harmony, then we would have this limited mechanism in place which can be invoked in a restrained manner to ensure that it does not succeed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, I rise to support the many substantive changes proposed by the Select Committee on the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Bill. I am particularly happy that the Select Committee has recommended these changes in response to views, suggestions and feedback made by concerned members of the public and groups during the Select Committee hearings and at the dialogue sessions organised by the Feedback Unit and other organisations in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am personally glad that the Select Committee has accepted my suggestion made in this House that the \"Prohibition Order\" be renamed as \"Restraining Order\". This is indeed a less threatening term and a more accurate reflection of what the order actually does. Sir, the Minister mentioned just now that the Committee also accepted the recommendation made by the Member for Ulu Pandan, Dr Dixie Tan, that the final recommendation of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony and the order of the Minister be made public. This will definitely reduce the likelihood of abuse of the system in that the Council or the Minister must ensure that the person upon whom the order is slapped, has truly gone out of line. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to note that the recommendation originally proposed by the Catholic Church and the Islamic Religious Council that the majority of the members of the Presidential Council be from major religious groups was also accepted by the Select Committee. As religious leaders, they would be in a better position to consider matters put before the Council. Besides these recommendations, the Minister has mentioned a number of other recommendations and inputs that were taken into account by the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many people I know are quite sceptical about the usefulness of Select Committees in the process of legislation in this House. Sir, they feel that Select Committees are an \"eye-wash\" in that the Select Committees only look at \"full-stops\" and \"commas\". People have the impression that once a Bill has passed its Second Reading, there can be no substantial changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view, the Select Committee on the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Bill has certainly debunked this misconception. The Report before this House clearly demonstrates the usefulness of Select Committees. I would like to congratulate the Committee for a job well done. I sincerely hope the public will realise the value of Select Committees and therefore be more willing to come forth with their views and suggestions for future Select Committees. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Batok):</b> Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I join Mr Das in thanking the Select Committee for a job well done: for painstakingly going through the points raised by Members and various representors; for accepting and incorporating many of the suggestions into the final Bill. We must also thank the representors for taking the trouble to make representation and for standing up for their beliefs and what they believe to be in the best interests of our nation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee has addressed a number of issues, but I am particularly encouraged by the fact that it has gone out \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of its way to provide additional safeguards against possible abuses: instituting checks on Ministerial or Cabinet powers. Amongst others, it expressly recommends that all Restraining Orders must be confirmed by the President within 30 days of receipt of the report from the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony. And in the event of a contrary report from the Presidential Council, the Elected President may, acting in his own discretion, refuse to confirm the order. This, I think, is in the best tradition of checks and balances in our democratic society. But it goes without saying that the best checks against abuse really reposit in the people: that the people must wisely elect and continue to elect the right Government and emplace men of integrity in positions of authority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to give the legislation a good start, the Government should select and appoint the members of the Presidential Council judiciously, and with as wide a representation as possible. The Government should, I think, informally consult the heads of the major religious organisations. Religious leaders on their part should not withdraw or count themselves out but participate responsibly as men of God and men of peace. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has explained that the judicial review is inadvisable in a situation where prompt executive decisions are required. A partial way to meet this demand which has been raised many a time is to appoint retired Chief Justices or Judges to the Presidential Council. Their legal perspective and their standing would, I am sure, be an asset to the Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that some religious groups feel that the Bill is targeted at them. I think their fear is unfounded. I believe that the honourable men in this Government have no intention of discriminating against any particular group. To do so would be to invite trouble. It would be foolhardy. It would unravel the multi-racial and multi-religious fabric of our society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must go back to the basics, and appreciate that this Bill is a preventive measure. It need not be used at all if all is well. But its very presence will help to check mischievous or misguided persons. It helps to maintain law and order, without \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> which no religious beliefs could be upheld or practised in peace. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, I must add that the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Bill is only part of the answer, not the complete answer. Its role, in my view, is mainly preventive and acting as a deterrent. The Government and religious organisations should consider ways to actively promote religious understanding and tolerance. Perhaps all should seriously consider expanding and strengthening the Inter-Religious Organisation or any such bodies, so that we will ensure inter-religious peace for our children and our children's children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I wish to repeat what I said in the earlier debate: that the Government should use this law \"sparingly, prudently and wisely\", and the people should \"take it in the right spirit\" and give the Government a chance to prove that it is operating in the greatest good of all, and that it is not against religions or any particular religion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Report of the Select Committee has brought forth a good number of welcome changes following submissions from the church organisations and individuals of the public. The Government has accepted many of the proposals of the representors. I too have no wish to be repetitive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in spite of the sound arguments presented, and the Government's so-called concern, it has refused to budge on two very basic issues, namely, (1) the \"activities to promote a political cause or a cause of a political party\", and (2) the role of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first touch on the political issue here. Government has said that the Bill is intended to maintain religious harmony in Singapore. The First Deputy Prime Minister has said that he is concerned about the mixing of religion with politics by some sections of the church. Submissions to the Select Committee have pointed out, as we have also stressed, that it is impossible to completely separate religion from politics. And now the Select Committee itself has admitted this to be so. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 15 of the Report states that \"the division between religion and politics is not a well-defined one.\" Such being the case, Sir, any Government allegation arbitrarily made that a religious leader or organisation has mixed religion with politics may be completely erroneous. Such an allegation would probably be based on questions, as put down in the Report, of \"public policy\" of Government. And of course on whether or not \"the issue is wise for the Government to allow, and not what is lawful for a person to carry out\". In other words, it is preventive, yes, but it is based on whether or not it is in the interests of the ruling Government political party. For example, if it allows too many and too often criticisms of its policies by critics, it could, and possibly would, mean considerable loss of votes for Government in elections. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpopular policies of Government are of course often subject to severe criticisms by the public and political parties. While opposition political parties' statements may be distorted and may not even be published in the press and so may not possibly reach many people, similar criticisms by religious leaders and organisations may well reach a wider audience through word of mouth, and so are more damaging to the ruling Party. As quoted by one submission, religious leaders' views have, I quote, \"extra credibility\". Therefore, whether or not criticisms of Government policies become, and I quote, \"activities to promote a political cause or a cause of any political party\" depend very much on how adversely the ruling Party will be affected by such criticisms. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this of course has nothing to do with liberation theology, as put down in one of the submissions, and which has so frightened the PAP. What is troubling the Government is not the mixing of religion and politics per se, because they cannot make out the difference, but how much so-called mixing of religion with politics will adversely affect the credibility and popular support for the PAP Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had said during the debate in June, Sir, the Bill, apart from providing a belated cover-up and excuse for the arrests of so-called Marxists, is really intended to be another step towards total control of public opinion in Singapore. Many people \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> share this viewpoint and that is why so many people do not support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue I would like to touch on is the role of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony (PCRH). Almost all submissions had pointed out that the Executive is given too much power in the Bill. The first White Paper on the Elected President says it too. That is why everyone has asked for more safeguards against the power of the Minister, and now Government says it too, In paragraph 14, I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Committee agrees that additional safeguards are desirable ...\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has however argued that the remedy should not be a judicial one as a court trial may mean delay and prompt action may be necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What remedy has the Committee then proposed? Paragraph 21 of the Report states that, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It decided that the proposed Elected President could appropriately provide an independent check on the Government when it exercises its powers under this Bill.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Elected President should be non-political, and its election open to wide sections of the people, such a proposal would have some merit and might be considered a good and fair proposal. But the proposed Elected President is to be elected from a very small exclusive PAP club. Only ex-Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and Chairmen of big corporations may stand as candidates for the high office. The common man-in-the-street is totally excluded. In the circumstances, how could the Elected President be expected to be completely unbiased, fair and independent in his decisions, even if he is a most upright man? It is true that the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony may offer its views to the Elected President and its advice may not be lightly disregarded. But the Elected President,\" acting in his discretion\", could well ignore the advice of the PCRH and confirm the restraining order made by the Minister and the Cabinet, as the Minister has quoted again,\" no Minister acts alone isolated from Cabinet\". So we go back to square one. The Minister and Cabinet, and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> perhaps the Elected President, all have more or less similar political views and will probably act similarly. In other words, the Elected President in the circumstances is no check at all on the unfettered powers of the Minister and Cabinet. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An independent check on the powers of the Minister and Cabinet must therefore be found elsewhere. A judicial review by a High Court Judge would be acceptable to most people. But the Government has rejected judicial review as a safeguard. I therefore believe that a most reasonable compromise safeguard would be the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony. Presently, its role is only to advise. Its role should be more than advisory. It should become the final arbiter or authority on all questions of whether any act or conduct violates the law in mixing religion with politics \"under the guise of propagating or practising any religious belief\" - words already accepted by the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has in fact been suggested in some written submissions to the Select Committee. One submission on page B48 reads as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We therefore recommend that Clause 11 (4) [that is of the original Bill] be amended to read: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council may recommend that the order be continued, revoked or varied in any manner and the Minister, in the event of a majority decision of the Council, shall accept [I emphasise \"shall accept\"] such recommendation.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the words are clear and unequivocal. The PCRH makes the recommendation which is to be accepted by the Minister, and rightly so, as at least two-thirds of the members of the Council are representatives of the major religions in Singapore and, I quote, \"being directly concerned, are in a better position to consider the matters which may be brought before the Council\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would be in keeping, Sir, with the correct purpose or tenor of the Bill. After all, the general understanding of most people is that the very people most concerned with religious harmony should be given the duty and responsibility to maintain such religious harmony in Singapore. This is also in keeping with the proposed policy of participatory democracy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Government be flexible enough to accept a most reasonable proposal which is acceptable to, I believe, the vast majority of people in Singapore? If it is a question of public policy, is it wise to allow a politically inspired Elected President to be the final arbiter in matters related to religion? Or is it wise to allow an independent Presidential Council which knows more of matters related to religion to decide on the exercise of power to make a restraining order? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, Sir, the answer cannot be in doubt. The Presidential Council must be the final arbiter. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade GRC):</b> Sir, I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the rationale for the Bill is very clear. The White Paper entitled \"Maintenance of Religious Harmony\" which was presented to Parliament on 26th December 1989 had discussed it comprehensively. The House had debated the issues involved during the Second Reading of the Bill in February 1990 and again during the proceedings of the Select Committee on the Bill. Leaders and members of the various religions and interest groups had the opportunity to express their concerns about the Bill, particulary as to how certain provisions will be implemented and they had also made many suggestions to improve the Bill. Sir, this is clearly a very sensitive Bill and in the process of discussing it, I believe that we have developed a strong consensus on the need for this Bill, which is preventive in nature, and this Bill can help to promote greater harmony and understanding among the people of Singapore. This Bill will give Singapore added security and there will be greater confidence in us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members of the House have already spoken on this Bill during the Second Reading of the Bill and also today and I would only like to deal with the general principles and fundamental issues involved in the Bill. However, let me just mention again that we need to continuously remind ourselves of the kind of society and nation Singapore is. Not only is Singapore young and small, we are a multi-racial and multi-religious society. In the circumstances, Sir, it is necessary that Singapore remains strictly secular. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Religious harmony and understanding underpin our continued social and economic development. For without stability and confidence, we cannot hope to thrive and prosper and provide a good quality of life for our people. So we have no options but to work hard to find ways whereby we can better promote greater understanding and harmony among our people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many examples of how things can go wrong in a multi-racial and multi-religious society. The Minister has mentioned just now of what has happened in India, and we have other cases, in Sri Lanka, in Northern Ireland, just to mention a few. We must therefore always exercise sensitivity when we deal with matters of religion, language and race. We owe it to our children and future generations to do all we can to put in place a system which can help to promote peace and stability. And to do otherwise is to shirk our responsibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee proceedings have given the opportunity to Singaporeans to give their views on the proposed Bill and they have indeed come out positively to participate in the process of formulating the Bill with their many suggestions and improvements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Select Committee has taken in many of the views for improvements and has made provisions to make the Bill clearer and also to introduce safeguards to ensure that any abuse of the powers in the Bill can be checked. However, the Bill is by no means perfect but as we gain experience in the implementation of the provisions, more improvements can be gradually incorporated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the question of separation of politics and religion. This has always been a sensitive issue to Muslims as it is difficult for us to draw a line between religion and politics in Islam. It has been pointed out by my Muslim colleagues in the House that Islam is regarded as a complete way of life by all Muslims and politics is an integral part of the Islamic way of life. Sir, however, having regard to the reality of the multi-racial, multi-cultural and multi-religious society of Singapore, we believe that this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Bill is for the common good of Singaporeans as it can to a great extent effectively check irresponsible and mischievous persons who want to create disharmony and misunderstanding. We understand that some line must be drawn to define the boundary between religion and politics to the best of our ability. And here, there is the assurance that Article 15 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Mufti and MUIS have given their support to the Bill and in examining the provisions of the Bill, MUIS has consulted the major Muslim organisations in Singapore. The Mufti has advised that in the circumstances of Singapore it is good and appropriate to have this Bill and, Sir, I strongly support this view. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Wan Hussin Bin Haji Zoohri -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Wan Hussin bin Haji Zoohri (Aljunied GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the existence and maintenance of religious harmony in a plural society like Singapore is an important condition in ensuring our prosperity, progress and peace. On the other hand, any conflict, disharmony or hostility between religions in this plural society will certainly lead to strife and violence. Thus, Mr Speaker, the presence of this Bill in the midst of our multi-racial society provides a safety valve that functions to alleviate any problem that might arise to hinder the maintenance of religious harmony. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewed as a whole, the Bill, along with the amendments that have been made following the Select Committee Report, would, I think, allay many of the concerns and fears of the society about the possibility of misuse by the Government. There are a number of clauses and sub-clauses under the Bill that provide additional safeguards against any abuse of power. They also go towards ensuring justice, integrity and fairness in its implementation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me now, Sir, to touch on some aspects of the Bill relating to the features I mentioned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, additional safeguards. I accept the Select Committee's view that the issue of religious harmony should not be decided \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> by the Court. The four reasons given in the Select Committee's report are sufficiently convincing and would remove any doubts in the minds of the parties concerned. Among the arguments are that this Bill is more of a preventive rather than punitive measure. If a sensitive issue like religion is brought before the Court, the publicity that will result from the hearing itself would stoke the anger of affected religious groups and this could lead to religious unrest. The question we should ask ourselves is: Do we want a repeat of the Maria Hertogh tragedy, which resulted from the decision of a judge, or do we want people like writer Salman Rushdie to be judged in court in the midst of a plural society like Singapore? The Bill puts public security and religious harmony above individual interests, the interests of the individual who is threatening to cause disharmony. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to the powers of the Minister, the Bill now provides that a Restraining Order issued by the Minister must be scrutinised by three other parties, namely, the Cabinet, the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony (PCRH) and the Elected President. Clause 12(3) of the Bill empowers the Elected President to decide on his own where there is conflict between the Cabinet's advice and the recommendation of the Presidential Council. Another new additional safeguard is in clause 13, which stipulates that the Minister, if he seeks to extend an order, must take the same steps as when issuing the original order. This safeguard provides room for review to ensure there is no error in the decision made by the Minister against the person concerned. Clause 11(3), which allows the person concerned to present himself and argue his case before the Presidential Council, is another improvement in the Bill. Clause 14, which allows the Minister to revoke his order before the expiry of the period, also reflects the preventive and not solely punitive nature of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>The Presidential Council for Religious Harmony</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the setting up of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony. In this regard, I would like a clarification from the Minister as to the method of selecting \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> members of the Council. Clause 3(2) of the Bill stipulates that not less than two-thirds of the Council members shall be representatives of the major religions in Singapore. Mr Speaker, we know that many different religions are professed by the people of Singapore. According to available statistics, the distribution of religions in Singapore in 1988 was as follows: Buddhism 28.3%, Taoism 13.4%, Christianity 18.7%, Islam 16%, Hinduism 4.9%, other religions 1.1%, and no religion 17.6%. I would like to know the criteria for deciding which are major religions and which are minor religions. Going by percentage, those who profess no religion appear to be greater in number than those professing Hinduism or Taoism. The rather odd question, perhaps, is whether those who profess no religion should count among the major religious groups of Singapore. Further, what is the position of other religions not mentioned here, such as Sikhism, or Judaism and Bahaism. What opportunity is there for those who belong to these religions to be represented in the Council? Also, how would representatives of Christianity be selected, since it has many different sects like Catholics, Methodists, Presbyterians, Baptists, born-again Christians and so on. Could the Minister give us some guidelines here? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>The Bill and the Administration of Muslim Law Act</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I fully understand the concerns of certain sections of the Muslim community about the effect of this Bill on the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA). I am relieved, however, by the assurance given by the Minister for Law that the Bill would not inhibit or impede the powers of the Muslim Religious Council of Singapore or the Fatwa Committee of MUIS, as long as these powers are exercised within the ambit of the Administration of Muslim Law Act. Specifically with regard to the Fatwa Committee of MUIS, I have full confidence that our Muslim clerics would not hesitate to issue any religious ruling based on Islamic principles alone and not on any legal provision in any form. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these considerations, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the speakers who have spoken on this Select Committee Report and on the revised Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may comment first on the points raised by Dr Lee Siew-Choh. I need not spend too much time because some of the points he has raised during the Second Reading of the original Bill. He advocates that the final decision should rest with the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony. Once it makes the recommendation, the Minister must accept, the Executive must accept. In other words, the final decision in tackling problems and potential threats to religious harmony is by this body of 15 people who have been appointed by the President on the advice of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights. He referred and quoted from one of the written representations. But if Members read the written representations that was one viewpoint which was put to the Select Committee. It is not an argument that is totally devoid of any merit. It is a viewpoint that can be argued. But there were also arguments put to the Select Committee with equal vigour and force that the Presidential Council should not have the final say and these are published. In fact, one of the religious groups, the Graduates' Christian Fellowship, if I may turn to pages B 7 and B 8, their view was \"once the Presidential Council has completed its work on the matter, the decision will lie with the Minister. Thereafter, if the Minister decides to proceed with issuing the prohibition order, the Presidential Council should not be further involved in the matter.\" So the Select Committee had to discuss the pros and cons and it decided that the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony should have an advisory role which we should take counsel from it and give it serious weight, and if Cabinet chose or wanted to disregard its recommendations, the Elected President would have a discretion to say no. Of course, there are good reasons for this, Sir, because ultimately, the question boils down to accountability. Who will be accountable? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take that proposal and adopt it, if a group or an individual embarks on what \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Government feels is very dangerous, very harmful, the matter comes up to the Council and the Council says, \"No. No Restraining Order should be made.\" Supposing their judgment is wrong and tensions quickly flare up. There is a conflagration and there are riots. Who is accountable? Then bring the 15 members into this Chamber to explain to the people of Singapore why they took those decisions? In matters such as this, law, order, security, prevention of disorder, diffusing tensions, in all governments it is a fundamental responsibility of the Executive and that is how it should be. So the approach here is that the Executive must take the responsibility and it must be accountable. Therefore, it must decide. It cannot pass the buck to one group of wise men and it cannot pass the buck to the courts. If it makes a wrong decision the Executive is accountable to the electorate. That is how the Select Committee's recommendations must be viewed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Siew-Choh's other point was about mixing religion and politics, and it is difficult to draw a dividing line. The Select Committee and the Government have never taken the position that the line is easy to draw. But having said that, does it mean that you do not take action when mixing of religion and politics poses a threat to religious harmony? Very few disagree with the proposition that mixing of religion and politics is harmful to our society. I have explained this on previous occasions. If one religious group does it, so must other religious groups. The Government cannot expect to stand idly by. It must then get its religious groups on its side and there will be mayhem and chaos. What is most illustrative of what Dr Lee Siew-Choh said is when he emphasised that religious leaders commenting on political issues can reach a wider audience. Precisely, Sir, that plus the fact that religious leaders are viewed by the flock and their worshippers as having closer links to God and with an aura of holiness and divinity, make it all the more imperative that if religious leaders want to enter into politics, they come down from their pulpit and participate as citizens. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encik Wan Hussin asked about the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony, how they would be appointed, the detailed criteria and so on. I would not want to prejudge these matters because, as Encik Wan Hussin knows, under the Bill the appointment of the Chairman and every member shall be by the President on the advice of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights. So obviously we must not pre-empt the scope of consultations and discussions within the Presidential Council for Minority Rights and the recommendations that they may give. But obviously, it seems to me that we must include the major religions, such as Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, Hinduism and Islam. We also have to include persons who do not belong to any organised religion and the wording of the provision is sufficiently flexible to enable us to do this. I might also add that the terms of office of the members have been drafted in such a way that it will stagger the membership and it is open to the Presidential Council to recommend to the President that whenever new appointments are to be made, it can take into account this element as to whether there has been a fairly wide representation of the different religious groups. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4></h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TOWN COUNCILS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Town Councils Act came into operation on 5th August 1988. Since then, 27 Town Councils have been formed. 18 Town Councils have taken over the management of the common property within their towns. The other nine Town Councils are in various stages of taking over the management of their common properties. Although the Town Councils Act is a relatively new piece of legislation, my Ministry has in the course of establishing Town Councils actively reviewed the provisions of the Act. Several Town Councils have also proposed amendments \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to the Act to deal with problems which they have encountered. My Ministry has carefully considered these proposals and concluded that changes are necessary if Town Councils are to carry out their statutory functions effectively. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One issue which every Town Council has to grapple with is the accumulation of arrears in service and conservancy charges. Arrears deprive Town Councils of funds to carry out estate maintenance work. People who chalk up arrears are in effect passing the cost to fair-minded residents who pay their bills promptly. A second difficulty encountered by Town Councils is that of deterring abuse of the common properties, for instance, abuse by owners of motorcycles, and dealing with such offenders. To deal with these two issues, clauses 8 and 10 have been introduced in the Amendment Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 empowers Town Councils to make by-laws to impose administrative fees and penalties for late payment of service and conservancy charges and other charges payable to Town Councils. Town Councils will also be empowered to collect deposits for service and conservancy charges from owners and tenants. These provisions will deter owners and tenants from late payments. The administrative fees and penalties will make it less attractive for people to delay payments to Town Councils and ensure that Town Councils do not incur higher costs unnecessarily. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 also allows Town Councils to make regulations to prohibit the illegal parking of vehicles on common property. This is a common violation which has caused much nuisance to residents. With this amendment, Sir, Town Councils' by-laws will now be applicable to residents and non-residents alike. It has to be so because visitors to a town ought to comply with the particular Town's regulations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 introduces new sections to the Act which will enable Town Councils to recover arrears expeditiously. Under section 43(1) of the Town Councils Act, a legal charge is constituted if the owner or tenant still owes service and conservancy charges after the expiry of 90 days from the issue of a notice of demand from the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Town Council. However, there are cases where a flat may be sold, surrendered to HDB, or re-possessed by HDB before the charge becomes legally constituted. In such cases, the Board requires the consent of the owner or tenant to deduct the service and conservancy arrears from compensation monies and rental deposits held by the Board. Clause 10 will enable Town Councils to request HDB to deduct service and conservancy arrears, including interest and penalty, from any compensation and deposits held by the Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 also allows Town Councils to retain fines imposed under the Town Councils Act or the by-laws made by a Town Council. The retention of such payments will help to defray a Town Council's costs incurred in taking enforcement and prosecution actions against offenders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable Town Councils to identify offenders, clause 10 empowers members and employees of a Town Council to request a person, who is suspected of having committed an offence, to furnish his particulars. Failure to furnish particulars will be an offence and upon conviction, a fine not exceeding $1,000 could be imposed. This provision also allows Town Councils to delegate the power to request for particulars to certain employees of the managing agents for the Town Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate enforcement against parking offences, the owner of a vehicle shall be deemed to be guilty of the parking offence as if he was the actual offender unless he proves otherwise. This provision is necessary for the Town Councils to carry out effective enforcement action against motorists who park their vehicles indiscriminately in the void decks or on any part of the common property. This provision is similar to that in the Parking Places Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another new provision in clause 10 empowers Town Councils to compound offences committed under the Act or their by-laws. At present, Town Councils have to prosecute offenders through civil suit as there is no provision for compounding the offences committed. Such civil suits are costly and time-consuming. Enabling Town Councils to compound offences will reduce the need for prosecution in Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there are some minor amendments to the Town Councils Act. Clause 2 of the Bill makes it clear that it is not the responsibility of the Town Councils to maintain gas installations. Gas installations will continue to be maintained by the Public Utilities Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill will enable a Town Council to appoint two Vice-Chairmen. In the absence of the Chairman or if the office of the Chairman is vacant, any one of the two Vice-Chairmen can perform the duties of the Chairman. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town Councils are authorised to collect charges for the use of any facility or service that they provide. This is spelt out in section 19(c) of the Act. What is not clearly stated is that this includes making charges for the use of any part of the common property, eg, part of the open space between blocks. Clause 7 in this Amendment Bill will make it clear that Town Councils can levy charges for use of any part of the common property, as was originally intended. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 11, employees of managing agents are deemed to be public servants for the purposes of the Penal Code. Since employees of managing agents are carrying out the instructions of Town Councils, they should be given the same protection provided to public servants under the Penal Code. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3, 5, 6 and 9 are consequential amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>2.30 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Pock Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Pock Too (Nee Soon Central):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my GPC supports the Town Councils (Amendment) Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Town Councils (Amendment) Bill will give the Town Councils the requisite powers to carry out their functions more effectively, particularly in the collection of service and conservancy charges. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to empower Town Councils by enabling them to introduce by-laws \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to levy administrative fees and penalties for persistent late payment of conservancy and service charges. Recovering money owing to Town Councils by residents who persistently incur arrears has always been a tedious and bothersome task. Town Councils have had to resort to various means to tackle the problem of arrears, such as posting up notices bearing the names of offenders, issuing letters threatening legal action or applying to the Small Claims Tribunal. This Bill will empower the Town Councils to impose penalties on those who incur arrears persistently and to demand the payment of upfront deposits to ensure that conservancy and service charges are paid promptly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While my GPC recognises that this Bill will help Town Councils to discharge their functions more effectively, we are concerned whether the existing arrangement for delegation of powers by HDB under the Housing and Development Act will remain. At present, Town Councils carry out enforcement action with powers which HDB delegates. Will this delegation of power continue after the amendment? Do Town Councils have the choice of continuing with the present arrangement? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern my GPC has is in connection with the compounding of offences so that Town Councils need not prosecute each and every offender. But what will happen if an offender chooses to blatantly ignore the compound notices issued by the Town Council? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have, first of all, to declare my interest. I am the Chairman of the Potong Pasir Town Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to support the Bill. I welcome the amendments because we at Potong Pasir run the Town Council ourselves. Unlike other Town Councils, we do not engage professional managing agents to do the job for us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we welcome these amendments because it gives more teeth to the Town Councils Act. But fortunately for us at Potong Pasir, even without the amendments, we need not resort to putting up notices of names of persons who owe the Town Council money. But, nevertheless, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> we welcome the amendments to the Town Councils Act which enable Town Councils to impose penalties and administrative fees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without these amendments, when we send notices, and we put in a lot of manpower to get back the arrears, the Town Council in fact loses money. So with these penalties, we do hope to recoup some of the monies expended. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Town Councils are now able to compound fines. Again this is an improvement because, under the present law, when any offender is caught, he has to be brought to Court for a remedy. And also now the Town Councils are able to keep the fines which are paid to the Town Councils' fund. Apparently, before the amendment, the Town Councils have to hand over these fines to the State. And also another welcome provision is that any offender who parks his vehicle at the Town Council's common property is deemed a vehicle owner under the by-laws made by the Town Council. Also with these amendments, tenants are required to deposit with the Town Council a security for payment of service charges and also the interests are now imposed, instead of 30 days, on a monthly basis. This is a welcome change. Also as has been mentioned by the Minister, now when a tenant divests his HDB property, the HDB will recoup the money owing to the Town Council and pay it to the Town Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I also bring up a related matter which concerns the Town Councils? This is the applications for funds for certain community improvement works made by the Ministry of National Development (MND) and they are disbursed by the Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC). At the moment, Town Councils may apply for certain categories of community improvement works to be wholly or partially subsidized by MND, and when these projects are approved, funds will be disbursed by the CIPC. But the mode of application is something which we are unhappy about. Applicants, normally the RCs and other grassroots bodies and the Town Councils, are now allowed to apply for these funds for community works. The applicant in the first instance \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> must go through the Citizens' Consultative Committee (CCC) and get the approval or support of the Advisor and Honorary Secretary of the CCC. The next stage is to go to the Secretary of the Community Development Secretariat or CDS. These two bodies are in fact under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Community Development. Although the Town Council is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Development, it is only after going through these stages that the application will be processed by the Secretariat of the CIPC, and then later on to the MND. These other stages come under the jurisdiction of the MND. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would urge the Minister to do away with the first stage, that is, to apply through the CCC and the CDS, because the Town Council in fact comes under the MND. I do not see why we should go to another Ministry to ask for funds. We should go directly to the MND. That I think is more logical. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of Potong Pasir, the MP there is not the Advisor to the CCC. In fact, the MP there had defeated, at an open and fair General Election, the person who is now made the Advisor to the CCC. Fancy that - I am the MP there, having won the election, and I have to go to the person whom I had defeated for approval. It does not seem right at all to me. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Town Councils should be allowed to approach the CIPC directly which is under the Ministry of National Development. I hope that the Minister will look into this anomaly and rectify the application for funds which are disbursed by the CIPC. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 3.00 pm. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>at 2.40 pm until 3.00 pm.</i>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <i>Sitting resumed at 3.00 pm</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Batok):</b> Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. First, I wish to declare my interest as Chairman of the Bukit Batok Town Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment is most timely and will give the Town Councils more clout to deal with a number of issues. It closes a gap in the existing legislation, enabling the Town Councils to apply the by-laws to visitors and non-residents in estates under their management. Otherwise, the Town Councils will be powerless and helpless against non-residents, who could abuse the facilities in the town and yet get away scot-free. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Town Councils will, through the amendment, be empowered to act against those who park their vehicles indiscriminately, with no due concern for environmental pollution or for the safety of our children. Many simply park their motorcycles in the void decks and rev up their engines early in the morning, adding to noise and air pollution. Some motorcycles have indeed caught fire in the void decks and they pose a danger to residents in these blocks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment grants the Town Councils and the alleged offenders the flexibility of compounding the offences, rather than be entangled in tedious and costly court actions. The provisions of administrative fees, penalties and the requirement for deposits would give more teeth to the Town Councils in tackling the problem of bad debts which is a major area of concern for most Town Councils. Some residents are genuinely in need of help and are unable to pay. In such instances, Town Councils generally refer these cases to the Ministry of Community Development and to the welfare organisations of the respective constituencies. However, there are those who can pay and yet do not pay promptly. These people are adding to the cost of running the Town Councils. Indeed those who pay promptly are indirectly subsidizing those who do not. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment allows the Town Councils to levy charges for the use of any part of the common property. I welcome this provision because Town Councils can now exercise their ingenuity to generate income from the use of this common property and thereby add to the improvement works in the town. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment also allows the Town Councils to retain all fines imposed under the Act or any by-laws made by the Town Councils. The question is: Are these fines collected taxable? The Amendment Bill empowers the Town Councils to prescribe offences which may be compounded. However, unlike the Housing and Development Board Act, there is no explicit provision to enable the Town Councils to prosecute offenders who infringe these by-laws or who do not wish to pay up the fines. In such circumstances, can we seek the Attorney-General's permission to prosecute or must we file private summonses? Whatever it is, the Town Councils will have to incur the legal expenses, and yet the income generated by these fines may be subject to income taxes. I hope the Minister, therefore, can help to clarify the situation on these issues. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tiong Bahru GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must declare my interest as a member of the Tiong Bahru Town Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the majority of Singaporeans are decent people. Civic consciousness and good neighbourliness are virtues not foreign to us. It is this consideration for each other that has made life pleasant in many of our neighbourhoods when times are good and bearable when times are bad. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With urbanisation and highrise living, the same kampong style warmth and outgoing spirit among neighbours has, perhaps, waned over the years. But it still exists. One thing remains unchanged, Sir, and possibly never will be, is that in every community or neighbourhood, you will find at least one misfit - either a family or an individual - who goes out of his way to make life unpleasant for his neighbours, by being inconsiderate, parasitical or downright nasty. While we should try to counsel such people on the folly of their ways, there should be recourse to bring them to heel if kid's gloves tactics do not work. The provisions contained in the Town Councils (Amendment) Bill give the Town Councils one such recourse. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, support the Bill. This Bill is another important step forward in the work of the Town Councils by providing it the means to deal with uncooperative and recalcitrant residents. These residents who are the minority are responsible for indiscriminate parking and littering of the environment. Such undesirable behaviour not only causes inconvenience and discomfort to other residents, but also increases the cost of maintenance of the estate. I also welcome the measures to address the problem of late payment of service and conservancy charges. Again, Sir, this small group of residents, although able to pay, chooses not to. This means they are being subsidised by the majority. Penalties against such people are definitely in order. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, this Bill aims to protect the rights of the majority from a small minority of difficult residents and deserves the support of all Members. I will, however, voice a word of caution. In giving the Town Councils the muscle to deal with such errant residents, proper care must be made to ensure that the Town Councils give ample notice to them before they wield the big stick. Blatant errant behaviour should be dealt with decisively. But in cases of back payment of conservancy charges and other dues, the Town Councils should not act too hastily if they are genuine cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in all things, Sir, soft words, then stronger ones, should be used before we use the big stick. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I lend the Bill 99% support. The other 1% will depend on how the Minister replies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity, Mr Speaker, to urge the Government to consider the other side of the problem. It is very well to use the stick and we have used it often enough to good effect. But should we not now turn to the carrot more than to the stick? Let us make the 1990s a decade for Singaporeans to show greater love for their country and to reflect this in a more sensitive concern and care for the place they live in. We have arrived at a stage in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> our history where we have achieved for ourselves a standard of economic well-being close to that of a developed nation, and I think we should set for ourselves a more refined and gracious social lifestyle that is commensurate with our stage of development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from reports of how some Singaporeans are behaving with respect to their environment, I think we have lots more to do. We should press on persuading and educating Singaporeans to show concern and love for the place they call their home. By this, I mean it would be very natural for them not to litter. It becomes natural for them not to park their cars illegally. It would be natural on their part to pay up their dues on time, meaning doing what comes right naturally. This idea will tie in quite nicely with the First Deputy Prime Minister's point on striving for 100% in productivity when he launched the 10th Anniversary of the Productivity Movement not too long ago. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illustrations he used were very vivid and I would like to borrow one of them. If you do not have 100% Singaporeans behaving themselves, but only 99% right, naturally then 1% of recalcitrants constitutes 1% of 2.6 million littering, misbehaving themselves, acting unsociably. And imagine the policing you have to do, to keep a look-out for them. They do not of course commit the offence at the same time which makes life more miserable. If you cannot catch them, you still have to support the policing staff, plus another group to clean up the litter. This too goes for the issuing of parking offences and so on. You can imagine how much trouble we create for ourselves if we do not take a long-term view of this. We have to take into account the ominous labour shortage we have on our hands. For not only does the Minister for Labour not allow foreign workers to work freely in unskilled areas, we have Singaporean parents who naturally want their children to do well for themselves in more skilled areas. We have a stupendous shortage of labour in the future. We know it is not good to attract labour into this area with better pay, so we need our people to train to be part of a skilled manpower and not part of a pool of unskilled workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think we should consciously institutionalise a programme to bring up future generations of Singaporeans who are naturally lovers of the environment, lovers of doing things right, lovers of conforming to the law. This way we can achieve 100% even in this area of Singaporean life. We need to look again at our existing courtesy campaigns which cater to our general public and look to some Government departments, like the Ministry of Education, which can reach the younger section of our population to help achieve this. There needs to be a concerted effort to reach children as early as possible in the kindergartens and through to primary schools, secondary schools, colleges, and tertiary institutions to seriously uphold and practise values which will naturally show in better social behaviour towards our physical environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town Councils too have a role to play in helping to bring about this scenario, through publicity and support, wherever possible. But it is the Government that has the machinery to penetrate every area of our society to effectively achieve this end. So I ask the Minister: does he concur with my views and, if he does, will he go through and review the Town Councils Act again and again, work out a balance between the carrot and the stick, and put in the spirit to take us through the 1990s successfully? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all the Members who have spoken up in such strong support for the amendments to the Town Councils Act. I would like to now address some of the questions which have been asked by Members and also some reservations which have been expressed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman for the GPC on National Development and Housing has asked whether delegation of powers or enforcement under the Housing and Development Act will continue. This is the present arrangement. Town Councils are at present carrying out enforcement work against abuse on the use of the common property or in some other areas, for instance, littering and spitting, which are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> delegated to them by both the HDB and the Ministry of the Environment. This arrangement was arrived at because the Town Councils Act did not provide for Town Councils to carry out enforcement actions against non-residents. Once the Bill is passed by this House, Town Councils would be able to carry out enforcement of all its by-laws against residents and non-residents alike. In which case there is less need for Town Councils to carry out enforcement through the medium of delegated authority, whether it is under the Housing and Development Act from HDB or the Environmental Public Health Act from the Ministry of the Environment. The intention here, Sir, is to provide Town Councils with the legislative basis upon which it could make by-laws to manage its common property and to see that the common properties are not abused in any way. It is the long term intention that Town Councils should avail itself of these powers under the amended Town Councils Act, make the necessary by-laws and carry out enforcement on its own, rather than depend on the delegated authority from HDB or the Ministry of the Environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng, and I believe Dr Ong also, asked basically the same question: Will town councils be able to prosecute those who deliberately ignore the compound notice that has been sent to them for offences such as illegally parking their motor cycles on the void deck or any other offences against the Town Council's by-laws? The answer is yes. Section 24(7) of the Town Councils Act provides that a breach of the by-laws is an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding $1,000. Therefore, if any offender refuses to heed the compound notice or refuses to pay the compound fine, Town Councils are fully entitled to prosecute the offender in court. One way for a Town Council to do this would be to engage a lawyer and carry out a civil proceeding against the offender using the powers provided under the Act. Another way is for the Town Council to seek a mandate from the Attorney-General by appointing a suitably qualified legal person to act on his behalf. If the person satisfies the Attorney-General's requirement to ensure that the prosecution \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> standards are not in any way sacrificed, then the Attorney-General can give that person a mandate to carry out the prosecution on behalf of the Attorney-General's Chambers. So there are two ways that a Town Council can approach such prosecution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok has supported the Bill but he cautioned that proper care should be taken by Town Councils before exercising the new powers under the amended Act. I agree with him that in all cases Town Councils should serve the notice to the offenders or serve appropriate notices to those who are in arrears before taking action to either prosecute or to even compound such offences. There are provisions in the Act which spell out how such notices can be served. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Eugene Yap has given the Bill 99% support and I think that is good enough for me. He spoke on the other side of the problem which is that Town Councils should also consider the use of the carrot and not just focus on the use of the stick, as with this Amendment Bill,they now have greater teeth and there are more powers to impose penalties and administrative charges. I must say that I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Eugene Yap and that while we have to spell out that penalties and deterrents are necessary, all Town Councils should bear in mind that this is not the only way to solve the problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important for Town Councils to accord equal priority and perhaps even greater priorities to educational and persuasive efforts to convince their residents that it is in their own interest to assist the Town Council in the task of managing the housing estate. Singaporeans, by and large, are very conscious of the need to be tidy, to be clean. You have only to walk into the homes of the average Singaporeans to see how house-proud they are, how orderly their homes are, how clean they have kept their homes. And yet there is a significant number of Singaporeans whose attitude takes a sudden 180 degrees turn when they step out of their front door and whatever is outside the front door, ie, the common property, belongs to somebody else, and they will not hesitate to litter or to dispose of unwanted bulky furniture at the staircases or lift landings, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> thereby causing obstruction to their neighbours and friends. It is in this area that Town Councils should continue to educate and persuade such people to change their habit and to inculcate greater self-discipline among the residents so that the task of managing the estate can be made simpler, less costly and also more effective. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all Town Councils have already initiated newsletters to establish contacts and rapport with their residents to circulate news and information to them. I believe such newsletters are a useful medium for a Town Council to educate its residents on the proper norms of behaviour, on how to avoid littering or creating a mess within the environment of the estate. I think through the medium of the newsletters, Town Councils should urge the residents to play their part so that the total cost of maintaining the estate need not go up unreasonably. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Act provides for penalties and deterrents, there is nothing in the Act which can be construed as inhibiting or preventing a Town Council from carrying out such educational and persuasion programmes. In this regard, let me assure Mr Eugene Yap that all Town Councils that wish to embark on any such programmes to offer incentives and carrots to residents to improve their social behaviour and social discipline will receive the full support of my Ministry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I come to the Member for Potong Pasir. He has also supported the Amendment Bill. The fact that he himself admitted that his Town Council has had to send notices to residents and also put in a lot of manpower to recover arrears indicates how serious the problem of arrears is to all Town Councils, including the Potong Pasir Town Council. He stated that under the present Act all the fines that are collected for any offences under the by-laws or any offences under the Housing and Development Act and the Environmental Public Health Act are handed over to the State. I would like to correct him on this. Even under the delegated authority arrangements, Town Councils are reimbursed for their cost in helping both HDB and the Ministry of the Environment to enforce the relevant Act. In the case of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> HDB, it pays to a Town Council 50% of all the fines that are collected for any offences referred to HDB for action. In the case of the Ministry of the Environment, it reimburses the Town Council $50 for every case compounded or prosecuted. This is because the Ministry of the Environment and HDB actually have to do much of the work, such as prosecution, serving the notice of compound and also receiving payments. So the fines received have to be shared out between both parties, HDB or the Environment Ministry, on the one hand, and the Town Council, on the other. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Potong Pasir is unhappy with the mode of application for grants under the Community Improvement Projects Committee, ie, the CIPC grants. I would like to point out to the Member that the mode of application for grants under the CIPC has not changed. CIPC was formerly known as the Urban and Rural Services Committee. It has always required any application for grants to be submitted through the CCC and there is a very good reason for this approach because the URSC, and now the CIPC, provides grants not only to Town Councils. The CIPC funds are available for any constituency to carry out improvement projects, even though it is in an area which may not be within the town. Because, as the Member is aware of, a Town Council's jurisdiction is limited to the common areas, the common properties, within the HDB housing estates. Many constituencies also have areas that are not within HDB housing estates, ie, the private housing areas and many of the shop houses which are non-HDB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, each constituency is entitled to apply for grants under CIPC to carry out improvement works in this area. The Citizens' Consultative Committee of that constituency is in the best position to assess the needs and relevance of the project, whether it is in the town or in the non-town areas. Therefore, we have continued to adopt a long established procedure for application of grants for such works. There has been no change. It is not a recent change that the Town Councils are required to go through the CCC before \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> they can make an application to CIPC for grants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have addressed all the points raised by the Members. Once again I thank them for their support and hope that with this Amendment Bill, all Town Councils will be able to carry out their work expeditiously and more effectively. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I have just one small clarification from the Minister. The Minister says that if any Town Council wants to embark on any project which will improve rapport or to offer incentives or carrots to the residents, it will get the support of the MND. I want a clarification whether this kind of support is financial or otherwise. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, it must depend on the nature of the programme and the kind of support that he is seeking. If it is an outright grant, then we will have to look at it and see whether there is a vehicle under which such grants can be made, or whether it would be better for him to apply through the existing channel which is, as I have mentioned earlier, the CIPC grants. These are available and the Town Councils could seek such support. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>Third Reading</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Third Reading, what day? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Now, Sir.

But here I would like to use this opportunity to take a very much closer look at the real issue behind the problems of Town Councils. Although the amendments will help the Town Councils to better manage the towns, these amendments, I believe, are only treating the symptoms and not the disease. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the real issue is this. What are Town Councils for? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Heng.

These changes take effect from Year of Assessment 1990. The Bill also raises the limit on tax deduction for employers, in line with the increase in the employer's rate of CPF contributions from 1st July 1990. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tax change relates to the tax treatment of approved unit trusts. Prior to my announcement in the 1988 Budget Statement, gains derived by a unit trust from disposal of securities could be treated either as trading income or capital gains depending on the circumstances of each case. To resolve this uncertainty, I announced in my 1988 Budget Statement, that a unit trust could elect for an alternative method of taxation whereby such gains would be taxed according to a schedule of rates based on the length of time for which the securities were held. This method was subsequently revised following representations from local unit trusts. Under the revised method, which takes effect from 1st July 1989, 10% of the gains derived by an approved unit trust from the disposal of securities shall be subject to tax at the prevailing corporate rate; distribution of the remaining 90% will not be taxable in the hands of individuals and foreign investors but be subject to tax if received by other persons; and when the gains are distributed to a taxable unit holder, the trustee has to withhold tax. The tax withheld will be available as a credit to the unit holder. Clauses 2, 4 and 8 insert new sections 10(11), 10B and 45C to provide for this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second tax change limits the tax exemption and deduction of contributions to CPF and other approved funds. This is to prevent the use of such funds as tax shelters. The change was first announced in my 1989 Budget Statement but was subsequently revised based on public feedback. The revised changes are as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) contributions by both employee and employer to CPF or designated funds in respect of the first $100,000 of total annual wages shall continue to be fully tax deductible and exempt to the employee; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the deduction for an individual's contributions to approved funds, including the CPF, shall not exceed the statutory contributions under the CPF Act; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) in the case of additional wages, the deduction is limited to the statutory CPF contributions from additional wages not exceeding 40% of annual ordinary wages; \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) where an employer's contributions to approved funds are in excess of statutory requirements under the CPF Act, or are based on additional wages in excess of 40% of the employee's annual ordinary wages, the employee shall be assessed to tax on the excess. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 7 insert a new section 10C and amend section 39 to give effect to this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reward effort and enterprise, I announced in my 1990 Budget Statement, a 5% across-the-board rebate on personal income tax payable for Year of Assessment 1990. Clause 10 provides for this concession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 5 amends section 14(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act to raise the limit imposed on the deduction allowed in respect of an employer's contributions to an approved pension or provident fund from 15% to 16(r)%. This would enable the limit to be in line with the increase in the employer's CPF contribution rate. The change will take effect from 1st July 1990. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BOARD BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the expansion and upgrading of the existing Science Council into a new organisation known as the National Science and Technology Board (NSTB). The NSTB will play a larger role in the promotion of R&amp;D activity in Singapore and in the for- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> mulation of national science and technology policies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will elaborate on the functions of the NSTB later, but first, why a new statutory board? Over the last few decades, our economy has matured. It has moved from high dependence on entrepot trade, to one which is driven by the twin engines of services and manufacturing. This has enabled Singaporeans to enjoy a standard of living which is one of the highest in Asia. Singapore no longer competes on the basis of low wages, but rather on a workforce which provides value-for-money. In order to keep improving our standard of living and to justify higher wages, we cannot maintain the status quo, but must move our economy up to a higher plane of development by focusing on higher value-added economic activities. We need to do several things, including upgrading the skills of our workforce, especially technical skills, investing in technology and infrastructure, and investing in R&amp;D, to exploit and to harness the full potential of the latest developments in science and technology. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of this, several research institutes have already been set up over the last few years and these include the Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB), Institute of Systems Science, the Information Technology Institute, etc. In addition, two more institutes will be established next year, namely, the Institute of Microelectronics and the Institute of Manufacturing Technology. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also seen a substantial increase in the number of engineers and scientists over the years, which has served to encourage more foreign companies to set up R&amp;D centres in Singapore. However, we need to continue our strenuous efforts in attracting more R&amp;D expertise from abroad to strengthen our indigenous R&amp;D capabilities. At the same time, given our limited resources, we need an organisation that can provide greater direction for the development of our science and technology human resources and the systematic identification of new and emergent technologies that will help contribute to our economic growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Budget debate earlier this year, if I remember correctly, in response to the hon. Member for Hong Kah GRC, Dr John Chen, I informed the House that MTI was studying ways to strengthen our coordination mechanism for R&amp;D and our science and technology management structure. MTI has set up a group which includes officials from the Ministries of Finance, Education, as well as the Economic Development Board, NUS and NTI, and private sector representatives, to coordinate the R&amp;D efforts of the various agencies. This multi-agency approach will ensure that we take a national perspective when we chart our long-term strategies for harnessing science and technology for economic development. Work has in fact already started. We have set up various expert committees with representatives from both public and private sectors. Each committee will make recommendations in their respective fields of expertise, and some of these fields include information technology, biotechnology, agrotechnology, and environmental issues. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsible for serving the main committee in the formulation and implementation of this master plan will be the new NSTB. So the purpose of the Bill which is being read a Second time today is to facilitate the expansion and upgrading of the existing Science Council to perform this larger role. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our expenditure on R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP has increased three-fold over the last 10 years, up to the years 1978-88. Our figure for 1988 was just under 1% of GDP devoted to R&amp;D. But this is still far behind the 2.5-3.0% of GDP which is currently the case for the major industrialised countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even compared to the NICs like Korea and Taiwan, we are quite a long way behind. We have some catching-up to do. Taiwan, for example, already spent about 1% of GNP in 1986, and has set itself the target of achieving 2% by 1995. Korea spent 2.4% of GNP last year and has set itself an even more ambitious target of 5% by the year 2000. Both these countries have very high-level coordinated mechanisms for science and technology planning. In the case of Taiwan, they have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the National Science Council; for Korea they have the Ministry of Science and Technology. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a coordinated mechanism to direct our long-term science and technology strategy is what we seek to achieve through the National Science and Technology Board. I must stress at this point that this greater emphasis by Government is by no means meant to dilute private sector R&amp;D efforts. On the contrary, we recognise that the private sector should continue to be the main driving force in R&amp;D activities. The role of the NSTB is to ensure a conducive environment and provide sufficient infrastructure and resources to support these efforts. So clause 5 of the Bill charges the NSTB with the following functions: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to encourage and promote research and development in science and technology; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to coordinate the establishment and development of research institutes and other facilities connected with science and technology; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to undertake programmes and provide funds to promote and facilitate scientific and technological research and development in both the private and public sectors; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) to assess scientific and technological manpower needs and engage in programmes for developing such manpower; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) to undertake exchanges and joint programmes with other national and international organisations; and, last but not least; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) to promote activities to increase public awareness of the importance of science and technology. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill sets out the powers of the NSTB to enable it to carry out its functions effectively. These include the powers to finance research institutes, specific R&amp;D projects undertaken by the private and public sectors, and the development of science and technology manpower. The NSTB will also be able to form companies or enter into joint ventures or partnerships. Such a private sec- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tor approach will be useful in developing, for example, the Science Habitat, as a centre of innovation by providing research opportunities as well as social and recreational facilities to attract scientific talents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8 and 10 empower the NSTB to raise loans and invest money in trustee securities respectively. These are similar to provisions in other statutory boards. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current employees of the Science Council as well as all existing contracts, assets and liabilities of the Science Council, will be transferred to the new NSTB. This is provided for under clause 18, read together with the Third Schedule. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, economic success will depend increasingly on the strength of our R&amp;D and our ability to harness the results of such R&amp;D. The NSTB will be an important part of the total national effort required to meet the challenges of our next phase of growth in the 1990s and beyond. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the establishment of the proposed National Science and Technology Board (NSTB) under this Bill is timely. Besides the encouragement and promotion of R&amp;D in science and technology, the Board will also be engaged in the coordination of the establishment and development of R&amp;D institutes and other facilities connected with science and technology. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a dire need for a body to coordinate this activity in Singapore and to provide guidance and leadership to the numerous Government-funded R&amp;D programmes which have been launched in Singapore in recent years. As the Minister has indicated, in high technology R&amp;D there are now four research institutes in Singapore. In biotechnology, we have the Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology (ICMB) which is part of NUS. In information technology, we have the Institute of Systems Science (ISS), also under NUS, the Information Technology Institute \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> (ITI) under NCB, and GINTIC for Computer Integrated Manufacturing under the Nanyang Technological Institute. Each of these institutes has headcounts approaching 100 researchers and annual budgets amounting to tens of million of dollars. It is also noteworthy that out of the four research institutes, three are in information technology. By this year, the combined annual budget of these three institutes would have grown to S$40 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, it has led to a situation where Singapore today, in fact, spends a higher percentage of its R&amp;D money in computer related fields as compared to Taiwan and Korea. In this enthusiastic support for computer related R&amp;D, it is possible that other equally important building blocks of industrial development might have been overlooked. I am glad to note that the Minister has pointed out that two additional R&amp;D institutes, the Institute of Microelectronics and the Institute of Manufacturing Technology, will be approved later in the following year. And each of these institutes might have headcounts of 100 researchers and again tens of million of dollars in Government expenditures. Besides direct involvement in R&amp;D, the Government, through its Science Council, has also handed out close to $50 million via its Research and Development Assistance Scheme (RDAS) since its inception to assist the private sector in its R&amp;D efforts. Again, the EDB has its own Software Development Assistance Scheme (SDAS) and Initiative for Technology (INTECH) handing out another $20 million in R&amp;D grants since 1985. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a meagre beginning, Sir, science and technology R&amp;D have blossomed into big programmes. As the Minister has pointed out, in 1978, the gross annual expenditure in R&amp;D by both the private and public sectors was about 0.2% of GDP. By 1982, it has grown to 0.3%. However, by 1988, it has grown to 0.9% of GDP, which translated to dollars and cents, Sir, was about $370 million in expenditure, of which 40% was direct Government expenditure. Given that our GDP, in fact, has doubled over the decade as I mentioned from 1978 to 1988, the actual dollar expenditure has grown more than 10 times over this period of 10 years and with major \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> increases squeezed into the last five years. With such rapid ramp-up in R&amp;D efforts, Mr Speaker, Sir, it would not be surprising that certain inefficiency, redundancy can be found in these R&amp;D efforts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there is also only a limited pool of R&amp;D personnel in Singapore. In fact, in the technological area, we are talking about 3,400 R&amp;D engineers. This rapid ramp-up in Government-sponsored R&amp;D has meant increased demand for these engineers. This increased demand has, in effect, removed valuable manpower from the industry, thereby depriving the industry of these valuable resources at the same time. And especially at times of severe shortage of manpower, doing so would aggravate the already tight labour market in our industry, leading to wage inflation and higher staff turnover. For instance, in the computer industry in 1989-1990, the staff turnover has been about 20% and wage inflation about the same order. This development, Mr Speaker, Sir, is definitely detrimental to the promotion of Singapore as an IT centre. Perhaps, during the period of high demand, it would be better if Government-funded R&amp;D efforts could be curtailed or deferred until a period of lower demand. In the past, this was not possible but, perhaps, with the establishment of the NSTB, this might change. I am also glad to note that one of the objectives of the NSTB is to monitor and plan for the appropriate level of R&amp;D personnel in Singapore. Hopefully under NSTB, similar problems that we have encountered in the past could be avoided. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is clear that R&amp;D is important for future industrial development. It is also stating the obvious that as we move up the technological ladder, we will reach a point where Singaporeans or Singapore industries can no longer imitate other people's technologies or even buy their technology. Thus, invest in the future in R&amp;D we must. However, I believe the way the Government has gone about investing its R&amp;D funds can be improved. My colleague, Dr John Chen and I have spoken on this issue during the last Budget debate. We pointed out that there was a need for a central coordinating body to manage the different and widespread R&amp;D \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> efforts currently underway. I am very happy to note that the Minister, in moving this Bill, is taking action to remedy the situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is perhaps too early to know how the NSTB will play this important coordinating role - what organisational structure it will adopt and what philosophy it will pursue. However, I would strongly urge the NSTB to begin its work by reviewing the fundamental philosophy behind Government-sponsored R&amp;D. In many ways, Sir, our current approach in R&amp;D, in particular, those efforts in R&amp;D institutes which are part of the universities, follow the American model. It is not surprising as many of our research personnel are US trained. The American model, Mr Speaker, Sir, is great for doing basic research, producing Nobel Prize winners. However, it has not known to work well in transferring technology from research laboratories into industry. In fact, in recent years, borrowing from the Japanese experience, the Americans have set up industry-wide joint consortia in an effort to get better value out of their R&amp;D money. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Japanese model of close collaboration between government and industry on joint R&amp;D programmes under MITI has produced many outstanding successes. Also among NICs, like Korea and Taiwan, particularly in Korea, the Ministry of Science and Technology has produced a master plan for moving the country into the 21st century, again emphasising on joint industrial collaboration. Taiwan also has followed this model of joint government and industry collaborative effort and its R&amp;D effort has also produced some impressive results. For example, today Taiwan is the world's leading producer of IBM PC compatibles. This very strong position is the result of the government-sponsored R&amp;D effort, producing R&amp;D technology which is then made available to the industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a small country. No matter how much we spend on R&amp;D, we are unlikely to match the efforts in countries like US, Japan, UK, Germany and France. Even if we have all the money, we are also unlikely to find \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> enough people to make our presence felt in the global competition for technological leadership. Hence, we should be selective in our choice of R&amp;D areas and focused in our R&amp;D efforts. I am glad, in this instance, that the Minister has mentioned the NSTB will oversee a master plan in our R&amp;D programmes. I hope under the NSTB, a small dose of realism can be injected into some of the more esoteric Government-funded R&amp;D programmes where the end results tend to be just some published academic papers. The NSTB should adopt a more pragmatic approach in evaluating the R&amp;D programmes under its purview. For instance, we should make sure that we have a comparative advantage before we embark on any R&amp;D efforts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Wong has to move a motion before 4 o'clock. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item under discussion and the remaining items on the Order Paper today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1 - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BOARD BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with restructured hospitals and independent schools, the Government is introducing free market practices in health care and education. We also know that this Government is also very tight-fisted when it comes to funding social and welfare programmes. This is the right approach since the Government makes sure that every dollar of the taxpayers' money should be properly spent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we should ask ourselves whether the same pragmatic approach is being used in funding R&amp;D. If getting $10,000 for worthy social programmes is difficult and getting a million dollars for some high-brow R&amp;D with dubious outcome is relatively easy, there is probably a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> lack of equity in fiscal control and management. It is our duty to ensure that all taxpayers' money spent receives a reasonable value for money. I hope that under the leadership of the NSTB, the Government R&amp;D programmes in science and technology will pass this litmus test. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I just want to ask the Minister a small point. What are the areas of R&amp;D in which the Government funds have gone into? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I welcome the setting up of the National Science and Technology Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace of technological change in the world has been nothing short of breathtaking in the last few years. These changes take place in such quick succession that a person often finds, at the point of coming to grips with a new technology, that his newly acquired knowledge is already on the way to being obsolete, or yesterday's technology. A National Science and Technology Board is hence timely for Singapore. I shall focus my comments on the composition or the kind of talent we must recruit to sit on this Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to appreciate technological change requires more than common ability, to apply and manage it, even more. The nature of technological changes suggests that the technological age favours the young and agile in mind. If you are over 30 years old, you may already be considered over the hill, in some cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who will comprise the Board should therefore be uncommon people with a certain technological flair and youthful zest. They should be people who can appreciate and keep up with the speed of technological change, which threatens to be even quicker with each passing phase. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small country with limited resources, our success depends on our ability to spot and catch the next wind so that we can focus our resources. With limited resources and a small base, we cannot spread ourselves too thin. By spreading ourselves too thin we encounter some of the problems already mentioned \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> by Dr Wang Kai Yuen. I support him when he says that we have to narrow down some of the areas of research and we must try to do well in those areas which we specialise in. To do so, we must have people, managers and leaders who are able to pick winners. The people selected to sit on the proposed National Science and Technology Board will be among our technology leaders. They must be uncommon people, fresh and dynamic enough not only to appreciate modern technology and keep pace with it, but also be able to manage such change and spot winners in our midst so as to advance our own drive for technological parity and perhaps advancement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I urge the Minister, that apart from looking for Board members in the traditional areas, the Board should enlist the services of younger people, especially those engaged in technology related businesses. If I may add, Sir, just appointing people who are constricted by long years of regimented thinking will not do in this business. There should be a mix of some who may be the gadflies of industry who understand the technology business better and hence better able to serve on this new Board. \n  <br>4.05 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi) in the Chair]</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to join in the debate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the setting up of the National Science and Technology Board to ensure that research and redevelopment in science and technology will be exploited to the fullest for our economic well-being. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in March, during the debate in the Committee of Supply, I emphasised the importance of ensuring success of our R&amp;D institutes because of the huge sum of money involved in setting up and running an institute, and because of the potential benefits it can bring to our economic development. I spoke of the need for a central body to assess the feasibility of setting up a new institute to provide direction to existing institutes, evaluate their \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> progress and ensure proper accountability. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to explain whether he envisages the NSTB taking on the responsibilities which I have just described under one of its functions stated in clause 5(b) of this Bill which is to coordinate the establishment and development of research institutes. It appears to me that existing R&amp;D institutes and even new institutes set up under other Ministries or statutory boards can continue their activities with funds obtained directly from the Finance Ministry and they do not have to resort to funds from the NSTB. Under these circumstances, will these institutes be answerable to NSTB, and will the Minister then explain how NSTB can effect changes to bring about good management, clear direction and complementary R&amp;D activities in these institutes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank all Members who have spoken and who have supported this Bill. I would like to take a few minutes to respond to some of their queries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, may I take Mr Chiam's query regarding where the Government's R&amp;D funds have gone into. I do not have all the details but I can explain to the Member in general the two areas of funding for R&amp;D which are supported by the Government. First of all, there would be the grants given to the various R&amp;D institutes, such as the IMCB, which will be used to run these institutes. The second area of funding, will be in grants for research and development schemes, such as the Research and Development Assistance Scheme for private sector R&amp;D effort. These were originally run by the Science Council but, as I indicated in my speech, it is going to be taken over by the NSTB. These are the two broad areas of funding. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to the points made by Dr Wang Kai Yuen. I think the question of Government curtailing R&amp;D activities in times of shortage of R&amp;D manpower has to be addressed the other way round. Rather than curtailing these activities, what we should be looking at are: (a) to see how we can coordinate all the various activities so that we can make the best use of the available manpower; (b) to see how best we can \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> attract further R&amp;D talent into Singapore. This is where initiatives like the Science Habitat and the fundings for the various R&amp;D institutes come into play. The point is taken that in a situation where there is a shortage of R&amp;D manpower, there will be tremendous pressure and tightness in the labour market, thereby pushing up cost. But I think we should address the issue from the other way round, looking at increasing the supply of R&amp;D manpower in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point he has made is about the fundamental philosophies of R&amp;D, whether we should continue to follow the American model or whether we should take a closer look at the Japanese model. I would like to assure the Member that these are very important issues to be discussed when the NSTB takes on the function of formulating the long-term R&amp;D master plan for Singapore. I think there were many other points that he has made which are very relevant and I will encourage the NSTB to take a closer look at these points and to consult the hon. Member so that we can pick his brains. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental point that he has made, that taxpayers' money should be well spent on R&amp;D and that we should be getting value for money, I could not agree more with. That will remain the cornerstone of R&amp;D expenditure for Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok has urged that when we look at the Board members we should be enlisting the services of people who understand technology. I can assure the Member that when we appoint Board members, not only for NSTB, but for all statutory boards, we look for people who can contribute positively and significantly to the job at hand. In the case of NSTB, in the first place, we will cer- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tainly be including representation from both the public and private sectors. In the case of the private sector representatives, we will certainly be casting our net as wide as we can to get the right people with the right temperament and expertise who can make significant contributions to the Board. So I take his point that when we are looking at people we will be looking at their expertise in this particular area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, Dr John Chen has asked where the various research institutes are going to get their funds from after the formation of the NSTB. Will they continue to get their funds from the Finance Ministry and the other Ministries or other organisations that they report to? I am pleased to inform him that after its formation, NSTB will take over all the funds which are currently being handled by the various organisations. This is in fact one of the reasons why we have set up the National Science and Technology Board, to coordinate the activities of the various research institutes which currently, as he is aware, are answerable to different organisations, different Ministries and so on. So henceforth, NSTB will take over all the funds responsible for funding the public sector expenditures which are used to run these institutes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>RECLAMATION</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Sentosa/Buran Darat)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S.

The area is shown coloured pink on the plan marked as \"Land Office Reclamation Plan No 4/90\", a copy of which is displayed in the Library of this House for the information of hon. Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed reclamation will link Buran Darat to Sentosa and will create choice sites at the east of Sentosa for private participation to develop a 400-600 berth marina, a resort hotel, up-market private housing and other commercial developments. This would enable us to maximise the potential of Buran Darat which is currently unutilised. The construction of the bridge link from the mainland to Sentosa will provide the critical mass that will make the reclamation of Buran Darat a logical development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reclamation is estimated to cost $106 million. The Sentosa Development Corporation, as agent of the Government, will undertake the reclamation which will take about 2(r) years to complete. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 113), approves the reclamation of the foreshore/seabed in the channel between Sentosa and Buran Darat containing an approximate area of 69 hectares as shown coloured pink on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN 4/90\" which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>RECLAMATION</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Changi East)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I beg to move the Motion* standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> *The motion reads as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 113), approves the reclamation by the Government of that portion of foreshore/seabed at Changi East containing an area of approximately 1545 hectares as shown coloured pink on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN 5/90\" which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Communications and Information and the Ministry of Defence have jointly proposed to reclaim approximately 1,545 hectares of the foreshore and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> seabed at Changi East. This is to create additional land at Changi for future airport expansion and for relocation of the Republic of Singapore Navy's (RSN) naval base at Pulau Brani. The proposed reclamation is shown coloured pink on the plan marked \"Land Office Reclamation Plan No. 5/90\", a copy of which is displayed in the Library of this House for the information of hon. Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 820 hectares of the reclaimed land will be used for future airport expansion. Based on the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore's long-term projections of passenger and aircraft movements, a fourth passenger terminal and a third runway may by required around the year 2006 and 2013 respectively. Approximately 125 hectares will be for RSN's Changi Naval Base development. The Changi Naval Base will replace the Pulau Brani Naval Base which has to make way for PSA's container port expansion. Approximately 315 hectares will be set aside for industrial and recreational uses. The balance area of approximately 285 hectares will be taken up for roads and replacement beaches. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation will be carried out in three phases over a 10-year period from 1991 to the year 2000. In view of the Gulf crisis, the timing of the reclamation will be reviewed if there is any further significant increase in oil prices. SPECS Consultants Pte Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSA, will be the Government's agent for the reclamation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 113), approves the reclamation by the Government of that portion of foreshore/seabed at Changi East containing an area of approximately 1545 hectares as shown coloured pink on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN 5/90\" which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT TO A DATE TO BE FIXED</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That at its rising today, Parliament do stand adjourned to a date to be fixed.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>POLICE HARASSMENT OF THE WORKERS' PARTY</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>4.21 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Workers' Party, a registered political party, publishes a newspaper called the Hammer, bi-monthly for which it has the necessary licence from the Ministry of Communications and Information. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's May issue of the Hammer (No.2 of 1990), the Executive Council of the Party published an appeal to the public of Singapore to help its Secretary-General pay the award and damages that may be made against him in the defamation suit brought by the Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew that was then pending against him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal informed the readers that the Council had opened an account for this purpose with the Standard Chartered Bank giving the number of the account, and that it had also appointed the firm of Messrs Gopalan Nair as trustees of the monies in the account. The public were expressly told to send or make their donations to the account with the bank. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two copies of the issue of the Hammer, immediately after the publication were deposited with the Ministry of Information, and five copies were deposited with the National Library under the Act. There was therefore nothing secretive about this appeal that was made by the Party to the public of Singapore on behalf of its Secretary-General. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I add, Sir, that a copy of the Hammer was also sent to the Headquarters of the PAP. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would have thought that this was a perfectly harmless and legitimate activity by a political party. You will remember, Sir, that not very long ago the PAP itself, at a dinner party which included a number of people from the commercial sector of Singapore, appealed for donations for the party. This was reported in the Straits Times, and the appeal was even defended in this House by the First Deputy Prime Minister (Hansard, Vol. 54, No. 6, cols. 499-502) when he was questioned about it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, we have seen from time to time appeals in the Straits Times and other newspapers for donations for victims of accidents or of catastrophic illnesses. There is also currently an appeal called the Spirit-of-Singapore appeal which has been publicised in the press for some months now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, naturally the Executive Council of the Party did not think it was doing anything outside the law when it published its appeal. But to its surprise, some almost three months later, as I have already been reliably informed, the Secretary-General of the Party and Mr Gopalan Nair, the trustee, were sent notices under section 120 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) to attend before one Inspector Lopez in connection with a police investigation into an offence under Cap. 128 of the Laws of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 128, I understand, is the House to House and Street Collections Act, and it makes it an offence for anyone to stand at street corners or at public places to solicit for monies from passers-by, or for anyone to go from house to house, knock at doors and solicit for monies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary-General then asked for a copy of the report made to the police upon which the police had started investigations. He was duly supplied with this report. And I have a copy of this report, and the report is made by Inspector Lopez himself, the Investigating Officer, and he said: He received information on 2nd August 1990 that the Workers' Party \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Executive Council had made an appeal in the Hammer, and that - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the Hammer was sold at two public places on 26th and 27th May 1990, and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that pamphlets were also put into the letter-boxes of the residents in the Tiong Bahru GRC. \n  <br>\n  <br>He did not say when the pamphlets were put into the letter-boxes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very odd, Sir, that information should only be given to the police on 2nd August when members of the Party had been observed selling the Hammer carrying the appeal on 26th and 27th May 1990. The report does not give the source of the information. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether the police was directed by his Ministry, or by any other Ministry, to investigate the appeal by the Workers' Party? If a member of the public had made a report, a copy of that report should have been furnished. But from what I can see, it would suggest that there was no such report. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the officials of the Party, the other members of the Council, as I have been told, were also asked by Inspector Lopez to attend. The police also raided the office of Mr Gopalan Nair, and the Workers' Party premises at Silat Road which the Party uses for its meetings. Then, without any notice to the trustee or to the Party, the police seized monies in the account. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask the Minister to take note of what I have said. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trustee was later informed by the bank that they were advised by the police that the monies were being seized under sections 58 and 68 of the CPC. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 58 of the CPC empowers the police to order the production of any document that a police officer investigating a case considers it necessary for his investigation. I have been advised that this section cannot (and I emphasise, Sir, cannot) apply to monies in a bank account. That becomes clear when one reads the proviso. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And section 68, the other section --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, on a point of order. I have no problems in answering it. But I think we have to follow certain procedures and order in this House. Should one under the guise of an Adjournment Motion claiming harassment bring to this Parliament questions of law which may be discussed by a Court should there be a prosecution? I think it is highly inadvisable, highly undesirable to do that, because we are prejudging matters which may come up in a Court if there was a prosecution. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Dr Lee, I suggest that you desist from that line of argument. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> I was merely trying to remind the Minister of these various sections. That's all. I am not interpreting them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am advised that the sections do not give the police certain powers, which I will leave to the Court, if he wants to take them to Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as I understand, Sir, the police have nevertheless gone to do things that they were not empowered to do. This is an alarming situation, because if the police can do this, then monies in a bank account are no longer safe. No one can be sure that his monies will not be seized by the police without first obtaining an order from the court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more alarming is that, in this case, the trustee was not even informed before the seizure to enable him to apply to the court to stop the police from seizing the monies. I ask the Minister: Does he not think that this is a most alarming situation which will seriously undermine confidence among members of the public in the banks? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bank in question, Standard Chartered, for its own part, never took the trouble to inform the holder of the account before it handed over the monies. What reliance, I ask, can be placed by members of the public in banks if the banks are going to hand over all their monies at a wink from the police without even informing the account holders? I hope the Minister realises the seriousness of the action by the police. And I ask the Minister \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to inform the House how he justifies the seizure by the police. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this positively illegal act of the police, police officers raided the house of a member of the Workers' Party who is not a member of the Executive Council, at the hour of 11.30 pm when the family and all had retired for the night. The member told the police that the hour was not convenient. But he was threatened that if he refused to open the door, the police would break it down. Although they were told that the film and plate, which they were looking for were not in the house, they nevertheless insisted on ransacking the house to confirm for themselves that the film and plate were not in the house. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From there, they proceeded to the house of a Council member, reaching the house at 1.00 am where the police again carried out a search but found nothing incriminating. Sir, let me ask: is it really necessary for the police to execute search warrants in the middle of the night? Or is this particular treatment reserved for members of an Opposition party, in this case the Workers' Party? Is there no respect for the convenience of the public? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, Sir, it is not as though the Workers' Party has been accused of a monstrous crime, and that if the search was not carried out at that particular hour, the thing that the police was looking for would be spirited away or disposed of. What justification was there for such a night raid? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not content with raiding the homes of the members of the Workers' Party, quite unnecessarily at unearthly hours, be it noted, the police had also harassed the people who have nothing to do with the Workers' Party. The printers of the Hammer were not spared. How are they responsible for an appeal by the Executive Council of the Party? Not only were the present printers interrogated but even the printer who had printed the Hammer in the past was also interrogated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Party who were summoned to appear before the Inspector were kept in the Inspector's office for as \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> long as four to five hours. Why? One member whose house was raided at 11.30 pm became sick (he said he vomited) during his second interrogation, but he was nevertheless not allowed to leave. He has complained that he was intimidated at both interrogations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons who sent in monies to the account in the bank, after seeing the appeal in the Hammer, were also called up to attend before the officer. Some of them have been so upset that they called up the Secretary-General of the Party to ask if it was a crime to have donated any money to the Workers' Party. I ask the Minister to say whether the Government considers it a crime for any member of the public to give money to the Workers' Party. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why all this frenzied illegal activity by the police? Is it not simply to dissuade and prevent members of the public from giving any assistance to the Workers' Party, whether in the form of business service or in the form of any donations? Is the Government attempting to frighten the printers from printing the Hammer for the Workers' Party? Is that the object? Is the Government trying to frighten people from giving any monies to the Workers' Party? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been suggested by some members of the public that the Government is hoping to disqualify Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam as an election candidate for a further term. Is that the object? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said, at the beginning, that appeals, similar to the Workers' Party's appeal, have been carried in the press. I ask the Minister to say now whether the PAP had in August 1989 applied for a licence under the House to House and Street Collections Act before it made its appeal at the dinner I referred to, and which was publicised in the press. I ask the Minister to say now: Was a permit granted under the House to House and Street Collections Act for the Spirit-of-Singapore appeal? I ask the Minister to say now: Was a permit granted for an appeal that appeared in the Straits Times on 10th July 1990? If no permits had been granted at all in all these cases, would the Minister say whether they have been investigated by the police for offences under the House to House and Street Collections Act? If not, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> why is the Workers' Party being singled out? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister to be good enough to give this House clear and direct answers to all the questions I have asked, particularly whether the seizure of the monies in the bank was authorised under any law, and if so, which law? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last word, Sir, police officers are public servants whose salaries come from the taxes paid by the people of Singapore. They are not, and I emphasise, not servants of any political party that happens to form the government of the day. If police officers who uphold the law for the common good act fairly and carry out activities lawfully, and not do things they are not empowered by law, then they would be respected and accepted as trustworthy and reliable friends, guide and protectors of the people. But if on the contrary, police officers should act unlawfully, toady to the ruling political party, and harass people and organisations, especially opposition parties that carry out legitimate and lawful activities, then they would lose all respect of the people. They become no longer guardians of the law, friends, guide and protectors of the people, but the oppressors of the people. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I was listening to Dr Lee Siew-Choh, it became clear that the Adjournment Motion was being used for no other purpose than to raise and prejudge certain matters which may or may not come up in a court of law. And I think it is highly undesirable and, in fact, highly inadvisable to have used processes of this Parliament and opportunities it gives to do such a thing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. When the police get information or report that an offence might have been committed they have to investigate. What is an investigation? What does it entail? It entails questioning of people, taking of statements, obtaining documents, exhibits, and whatever in connection with that matter for the police to arrive at some conclusion as to whether or not there is cause for putting up papers to the Public Prosecutor. And the Public Prosecutor has to decide whether there are grounds to prosecute, whether an offence \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> has been committed. In other words, when the police have an ongoing investigation, there may be a prosecution or there may not be. There may be a court trial. It depends on the police investigation. It depends on the Public Prosecutor's decision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it desirable? Is it advisable to discuss details here which may form the subject matter of a court case should there be a prosecution? By all means, raise matters which one considers to be abuse of police powers or harassment, which is the wording of the motion. But under the guise of an Adjournment Motion, I do not think one should bring into this House issues of guilt or innocence, in this case, of the Workers' Party or any of its officials. It is not for this House to decide. It is totally improper to ask this House to consider these matters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just indicate evidence of such abuse. He has said that he did not think it was an offence under the House to House and Street Collections Act. He refers to the seizure of bank accounts. He says there is no power under section 58 and section 68. I have not looked at these sections. But whether the police have power or not is a matter to be argued before a court of law. And I am sure the Workers' Party has lawyers in its committee, or amongst its members, to raise these issues properly in court if the matters come up to court. Dr Lee Siew-Choh says they are harmless and legitimate activities. If they are so, then there is nothing to worry about. He says the police action is illegal. There are remedies for this. If the Member considers that these legal issues are at stake, are they to be raised here? Whether or not seizure of the money was properly done in accordance with the law? The police have had a long experience in implementing laws and provisions of the Penal Code or the Criminal Procedure Code relating to seizure of bank accounts. I find it inconceivable that in this case they would have transgressed the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these are questions of law which were raised, ie, the guilt or innocence of the Workers' Party. It is not for me to decide, not for Members here to decide. It is for the courts to decide should the matter come up to the courts. And it has \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> not even reached that stage. So it is highly premature. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, harassment. What harassment? When the police have a report, they have to investigate. They have to question people who they believe may have information or knowledge about the alleged offence. There are well established procedures, whether it is for seizure of documents, search of the premises and so on. And there are provisions in the law governing what is permissible and what is not permissible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, when I received a copy of the notice of Dr Lee Siew-Choh, I had to ask the police and the Ministry officials what could it be about. Then I was told that the only possible thing could be that there is this ongoing investigation. So I said, \"What could be the things which the police have done that have prompted this Adjournment Motion?\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has referred to certain matters. Somebody vomited. The facts are: this person who vomited turned up for questioning. After he vomited, he said he had not had breakfast. What did the police do? They stopped the questioning and told him to take time off for a meal. Is that harassment? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another person told the police when asked to come for questioning that he had recently been ill. So the police said, \"In that case, you do not have to come down to our place. We are prepared to come to your house to interview you.\" But he chose instead to come down on his own to the police premises to answer questions. Is that police harassment? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary-General of the Workers' Party and others who were asked for questioning told the police that the dates given for the interview were inconvenient and therefore they would not come. The police gave them alternative dates. Is that harassment? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary-General, Mr Jeyaretnam, and others also insisted on having certain documents before they agreed to attend questioning. And the police gave them \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> those documents. How is that harassment? Searching the house at 11.30 pm, midnight? I do not know. These are operational matters which we must leave it to the police. I would just assume that that is to ensure that the person is in the house and premises when the search takes place. How is this harassment? Have doors been broken down? Have people been assaulted? Furniture damaged? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, Sir, although the Adjournment Motion baldly speaks of harassment, the substance of what Dr Lee Siew-Choh raised were essentially legal issues which ought to be taken up in another forum, another place, another time, if there is a court trial and the few instances of harassment are not really harassment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave examples of other fund raising and so on. I do not have details of how those funds were collected. I certainly cannot recall the PAP or any other political party which has had to pay legal cost and damages going around house to house or streets pestering people to give them money. But if the police have a report that any individual or group has in fact violated the provisions of the House to House and Street Collections Act, or violated the provisions of any other law, I have no doubt the police will investigate. There is nothing to stop people from giving donations to the Workers' Party or any other political party.
