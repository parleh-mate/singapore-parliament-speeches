B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwhat  was the total of all Singapore monies, private and public,\r\n\r\ninvested  in  Suzhou and how much of it represented monies  from\r\n\r\nthe taxpayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) is developed by a\r\n\r\nChinese-Singaporean joint venture company called China Singapore\r\n\r\nSuzhou   Industrial  Park  Development  Company   (CSSD).    The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Consortium,  called  the  Singapore  Suzhou  Township\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Pte  Ltd (SSTD) owns 65% of  CSSD.   There  are  24\r\n\r\nshareholders  in SSTD.  Ten are Government linked  companies  or\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards,  whose total investment in  SSTD  is  US$65.5\r\n\r\nmillion.    Ten  shareholders  are  Singaporean  companies   not\r\n\r\nconnected  with  the Government.  Four are non-Singaporean  MNCs\r\n\r\nfrom Japan, South Korea, Netherlands and the US.  Details are in\r\n\r\nthe Annex (Cols. 125-32) which has been distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980114/19980114-HA-0680125.htm\">Annex (Cols. 125 - 132)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the SSTD shareholders include publicly listed\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  MNCs, the SIP project has to be viable.   SSTD's\r\n\r\ninvolvement  in  SIP has to be transparent  and  tenable.    Any\r\n\r\nlosses  sustained will be made public and available for scrutiny\r\n\r\nby the international investment community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since SIP is a major infrastructure project, it is not\r\n\r\nrealistic  to  expect immediate profits.  But CSSD believes  SIP\r\n\r\ncan become profitable in the medium term, ie, within five to six\r\n\r\nyears from the start.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both governments are committed to the success of the\r\n\r\nproject.   Their strong support has enabled the park to  develop\r\n\r\nrapidly in its first three years.  To-date, SIP has attracted 99\r\n\r\nprojects   with  investment  commitments  amounting  to   US$2.7\r\n\r\nbillion,  of  which  80  are industrial  projects  worth  US$2.1\r\n\r\nbillion.  The average size of projects, at US$27 million, is the\r\n\r\nhighest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  China.  41 plants have already started production  while  22\r\n\r\nare  under construction.   These include major projects from the\r\n\r\nUS, Europe, Japan and other Asian countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, SIP's progress is being affected by the\r\n\r\naggressive  promotion of a rival industrial park by  the  Suzhou\r\n\r\nGovernment, the Suzhou New District (SND).  When we started SIP,\r\n\r\nSND  was already in existence.  However, Suzhou City and Jiangsu\r\n\r\nProvincial  governments assured us that they  would  give  their\r\n\r\nwhole-hearted  support  to the SIP because  it  was  a  flagship\r\n\r\nproject  for both countries.  But over the past three years,  it\r\n\r\nhas  become clear that the Suzhou city government believes  that\r\n\r\nthey  will get more projects by promoting both parks.  They have\r\n\r\nincreasingly stepped up their support for SND against SIP.  This\r\n\r\nculminated in the award of the APEC State Science and Technology\r\n\r\nPark status for SND in September 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such aggressive competition within Suzhou must reduce\r\n\r\ninvestments  to  SIP.  Investors will stay away rather  than  be\r\n\r\ncaught in the competition between the two parks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, we dealt with this basic contradiction on a\r\n\r\ncase-by-case  basis.   But  at a meeting  with  German  business\r\n\r\nleaders  in  Hamburg on 4th November last year, a  Suzhou  Vice-Mayor  openly  promoted SND and downgraded his own  government's\r\n\r\ncommitment to SIP.  He disagreed with German investors that  SIP\r\n\r\nhad  the  support  of President Jiang Zemin and  advised  German\r\n\r\ncompanies to go directly into China without Singapore.  Two days\r\n\r\nlater,  in another forum in Cologne, he told investors that  all\r\n\r\nthe resources in Jiangsu and Suzhou would be placed behind SND.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International investors are now aware of the serious and\r\n\r\nfundamental  conflict between SIP and SND.   They  must  believe\r\n\r\nthat  SND,  which is wholly owned by the Suzhou City government,\r\n\r\nwill  get  priority  support, not SIP, which is  only  one-third\r\n\r\nowned   by  the  Chinese  joint  venture  partner.   To  restore\r\n\r\nconfidence, we must resolve the problem openly.  Investors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust be convinced that the problem has indeed been resolved, and\r\n\r\nnot simply swept under the carpet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign investors in SSTD, who have staked their money\r\n\r\non  the  success  of the SIP project, are also concerned.   They\r\n\r\nexpect a reasonable return on their investment, which they  made\r\n\r\nin the belief that they would have fewer problems doing business\r\n\r\nin China by participating in the Singapore-China project.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulties encountered by SIP, and the way they are\r\n\r\nresolved, will set a precedent for how foreign investors in  the\r\n\r\nSIP  can expect to resolve their own problems.  Our difficulties\r\n\r\nmust  be  settled  by rational and logical arguments.   We  must\r\n\r\nrestructure  the arrangements to become a win-win situation  for\r\n\r\nboth  Suzhou and the Singapore and foreign investors.  This will\r\n\r\nboost  investor confidence in SIP.  If we gloss over the issues,\r\n\r\nSIP  will  become  another  run-of-the-mill  park,  creating  no\r\n\r\nspecial value for its shareholders, its tenants, or China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Chinese and Singapore governments recognise the\r\n\r\nimportance  of the project, and its benefits to both  countries.\r\n\r\nPresident  Jiang Zemin has given his full support  to  resolving\r\n\r\nthe problem.  Singapore too is fully committed to the success of\r\n\r\nSIP.   We  are  confident that by being open, and  tackling  the\r\n\r\nissue  directly and completely, we will solve the  problems  and\r\n\r\nrestore the project to a strong and even footing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

So  Passed,  Special  Mention,   Substandard,\r\n\r\nDoubtful and Loss.  If they are graded Substandard, Doubtful and\r\n\r\nLoss, then they are considered as Classified loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of end-November 1997, classified loans to Malaysia,\r\n\r\nIndonesia, Thailand, Korea and the Philippines amounted to  3.2%\r\n\r\n(S$1.2  billion) of loans to these countries by the local banks.\r\n\r\nThis was 0.5% of their total global assets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total classified loans of the local banks, whether on\r\n\r\ntheir  local  or  overseas loan portfolios, as a  percentage  of\r\n\r\ntheir  total  loans,  was 2.0% as compared with  1.5%  one  year\r\n\r\nearlier.

As the\r\n\r\nregional crisis unfolds, the percentage of classified loans will\r\n\r\nincrease.  The local banks have informed the MAS that they  will\r\n\r\nmake  adequate  provisions  for this eventuality  in  line  with\r\n\r\nprudent banking practice, in addition to the specific provisions\r\n\r\nwhich they have made on the existing classified loans.

They  have  also\r\n\r\nbuilt  up  substantial  buffers, as  a  result  of  prudent  and\r\n\r\nconservative accounting practice.  Many of the assets  on  their\r\n\r\nbooks are valued at historical prices, well below present market\r\n\r\nvalues.  They have also made substantial general provisions over\r\n\r\nthe  years,  in  anticipation of precisely such an  eventuality.\r\n\r\nThere is no danger of their regional exposures causing a banking\r\n\r\ncrisis in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our banks to grow, they must venture into the region.\r\n\r\nThis will always involve some risk, as the current crisis shows.\r\n\r\nBut  it  would be totally wrong to conclude from this experience\r\n\r\nthat our banks and other firms should stay in Singapore and stop\r\n\r\nventuring offshore.

We  monitor  the  property   situation\r\n\r\nclosely.  We were watching the reaction to the May 1996 measures\r\n\r\nand  we  were checking the developments in the property  market.\r\n\r\nWe  knew  that  the supply that is forthcoming due  to  previous\r\n\r\nyears'  sales will result in between 10,000-12,000  units  every\r\n\r\nyear,  and  we  were watching whether there will be  demand   to\r\n\r\nabsorb this supply.  In the good years, the demand easily ranged\r\n\r\nbetween  10,000-12,000.  In 1996 and also in 1997,  we  expected\r\n\r\nthe  demand  to range between 6,000-8,000 units.  So curtailment\r\n\r\nof  the supply for the last quarter of 1997 and a review of  the\r\n\r\n1998 supply are prudent things to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, will the Minister agree that the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  response to the likely downturn  of  the  property\r\n\r\nmarket  seems to be a shift, compared to several years ago  when\r\n\r\nSingaporeans complained that property prices were too  high  and\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  lot  of speculation.  It seems  to  me  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was dragging its feet in depressing property  prices.\r\n\r\nWould the Minister care to explain?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> That is not true. As property prices\r\n\r\nmoved  up  since 1992, the Government increased land sales  from\r\n\r\n1,000 to 1,500 units, from 2,000 to 3,000, to 4,000 and then  to\r\n\r\n6,000  units.  So the Government has responded each year with  a\r\n\r\nlarger  land sales increase.  Similarly, in this downturn,  once\r\n\r\nwe detect that there will be excess supply, it would seem rather\r\n\r\nirresponsible of the Government to continue to push out 5,000 or\r\n\r\n7,000 units when the demand is not there.  So we have moved  the\r\n\r\nsupply  up when the demand is there and I think correspondingly,\r\n\r\nit  is right for us to also cut back on the supply if the demand\r\n\r\nis soft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister, although the\r\n\r\ndecision  was  not  his,  what was the  reason  for  asking  the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  REDAS to give up his post after the  lobbying  was\r\n\r\nmade and the announcement of the Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, as I recollect, the Government did\r\n\r\nnot ask the Chairman of REDAS to give up his post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HDB STUDIO APARTMENTS FOR THE ELDERLY</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for National Development\r\n\r\nwhether  the  studio apartments that the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  plans  to build for the elderly (i) will be  equipped  in\r\n\r\nsuch   a  way  as  to  allow  the  frail  and  elderly  to  stay\r\n\r\nindependently  in  their  homes,  (ii)  will  have  any   alarm,\r\n\r\nsurveillance  and  support systems built in  the  apartments  to\r\n\r\ncater  for  emergency and unforeseen situations, and (iii)  will\r\n\r\nhave  spatial  or structural allowances for future modifications\r\n\r\nto allow the semi-independent elderly to live in.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the studio apartment is\r\n\r\npurpose-built  to  cater to the needs of  the  elderly  lessees.\r\n\r\nWithin the block, lifts will stop at every floor.

The new Micropolis management,  which\r\n\r\nled  the  acquisition, had expected to turn the  company  around\r\n\r\nfrom  its  previous losses and re-establish it as  a  profitable\r\n\r\nhigh-end disk drive manufacturer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following its acquisition by Singapore Technologies in\r\n\r\n1996,  Micropolis refocused its range of product  offerings  and\r\n\r\nchanged  its market strategy to focus on the original  equipment\r\n\r\nmanufacturing (OEM) sector of the market.  With the phasing  out\r\n\r\nof   obsolete  products  and  the  launching  of  new  products,\r\n\r\nMicropolis   managed  to  secure  several  new  OEM   customers.\r\n\r\nMicropolis  also continued to reduce operating losses throughout\r\n\r\n1996,  and  turned in a profit for the month of  December  1996.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  although  total operating losses  amounted  to  S$76\r\n\r\nmillion   in  1996,  Micropolis  was  actually  showing  gradual\r\n\r\nimprovement in its performance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the high-end disk drive industry took a dramatic\r\n\r\ndownturn  in  1997, with the aggressive entry of  several  major\r\n\r\nplayers.   As  most  of  you may know  from  the  various  press\r\n\r\nreports,  there was severe over-capacity in 1997 as a result  of\r\n\r\nsimultaneous  investments by existing  and  new  players.   This\r\n\r\nresulted  in over-supply and intense price competition.   Prices\r\n\r\nwere  dropping  at 16% to 18% each quarter in 1997,  some  three\r\n\r\ntimes the normal rate of 5% to 6% price erosion each quarter  as\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  competed  for market  share.   Industry  analysts\r\n\r\nbelieved  that  the disk drive industry is in the  throes  of  a\r\n\r\nmajor adjustment stretching into 1998.  The leading players have\r\n\r\neither sounded alarm over their earnings prospects or have taken\r\n\r\nsteps to consolidate their operations, including closing plants,\r\n\r\nlaying off workers or delaying new investments.   In fact, there\r\n\r\nare  reports in today's papers regarding Seagate's, the  largest\r\n\r\ndisk  drive  manufacturer in the world, plans for  such  changes\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout 1997, Micropolis' operating losses mounted, as\r\n\r\nsales  continued  to fall below projections and product  margins\r\n\r\nwere eroded faster than expected.  There\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  excess inventory in the market.  Micropolis was  unable  to\r\n\r\nturn around in 1997. Operating losses progressively worsened  in\r\n\r\nthe  first  half of 1997.  By mid-1997, Micropolis  was  already\r\n\r\nexploring various alternatives for partnerships or mergers  with\r\n\r\nother  market  leaders  but  without  success.   Prospects   for\r\n\r\nrecovery  worsened  considerably with the sharp  change  in  the\r\n\r\ncompetitive  environment as 1997 progressed.   By October  1997,\r\n\r\nthe  operating  loss  for  the year had reached  S$200  million.\r\n\r\nHaving  reviewed  the company's business performance,  resources\r\n\r\nand  prospects, the Micropolis Board of Directors was left  with\r\n\r\nno choice but to wind up the business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>What went wrong in the process of the acquisition?</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to accept that risk-taking is part and parcel of\r\n\r\nall  investment  decisions.  In acquiring Micropolis,  Singapore\r\n\r\nTechnologies had believed that the new management could turn the\r\n\r\ncompany  around by focusing on the high-end niche  market  which\r\n\r\nhad  been  a profitable industry segment. Singapore Technologies\r\n\r\ncarried  out  a  four-month  due  diligence  with  its  external\r\n\r\nconsultants  on  the investment before the acquisition.   As  it\r\n\r\nturned out, the severe over-capacity in the high-end disk  drive\r\n\r\nmarket was not anticipated by Singapore Technologies and was the\r\n\r\nmain reason which made this investment a loss-making venture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>How much money was lost from the acquisition to the closure of the company?</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company is under liquidation. This means that the\r\n\r\nfinancial  affairs  of  Micropolis  are  now  independently  and\r\n\r\nprofessionally managed by experienced liquidators from reputable\r\n\r\ninternational  firms.  They will determine how best  to  recover\r\n\r\nand  dispose  of  the assets of the company in  the  process  of\r\n\r\nliquidation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the Statement of Affairs lodged by the Liquidators\r\n\r\nof  Micropolis  in  December  1997,  Micropolis  does  not  have\r\n\r\nsufficient  realisable  assets  to  fully  repay  the  unsecured\r\n\r\ncreditors,   including   Singapore   Technologies.      Recovery\r\n\r\nexpectation is about 10% of the debts claimed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Technologies has S$80 million as ---\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

In  March  1996, the Chief Justice,  in  his  keynote\r\n\r\naddress  at  the  Fifth  Subordinate  Courts  Workplan  Seminar,\r\n\r\nannounced that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperational  and  jurisdictional aspects  of  the  Small  Claims\r\n\r\nTribunals would be regularly reviewed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A working committee, chaired by a District Judge and\r\n\r\ncomprising  members  from the Subordinate Courts,  has  proposed\r\n\r\namendments to the Small Claims Tribunals.  The Chief Justice has\r\n\r\nendorsed these amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments seek to achieve the following objectives:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, enlarge the powers of the Registrar of the Small\r\n\r\nClaims Tribunals;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, expedite the procedure for the hearing and\r\n\r\ndisposal  of  claims  through  a  system  of  consultations  and\r\n\r\nhearings  by telephone,  videophone and other electronic  means;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, permit respondents to admit claims by telephone or\r\n\r\nin writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enlarging the powers of the Registrar</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, applications to set aside orders made in default\r\n\r\nby   the   Registrar  of  the  Small  Claims  Tribunal  at   the\r\n\r\nconsultation  stage  are  heard only by  a  Referee.   As  these\r\n\r\napplications  are simple and straightforward, the Registrar  can\r\n\r\ndeal  with  them.  Further, under the current position,  if  the\r\n\r\nReferee  allows the application to set aside the default  order,\r\n\r\nhe  will  proceed to hear the claim.  This deprives both parties\r\n\r\nof  the  opportunity to settle the claim by consultation  before\r\n\r\nthe Registrar.  The proposed amendments will allow the Registrar\r\n\r\nto proceed with the consultation after setting aside the default\r\n\r\norder and to refer the matter to the Referee only if there is no\r\n\r\nsettlement  after the consultation.  The proposed amendments  to\r\n\r\nsection  17, by adding two new sub-sections (9) and  (10),  will\r\n\r\nempower  the Registrar to hear the application to set aside  the\r\n\r\ndefault order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consultations and hearings via telephones, videophones or other electronic means</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, after a claim is filed with the Tribunals, a\r\n\r\nNotice of Consultation is sent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto both parties requiring them to attend a consultation session.\r\n\r\nIf  a  settlement is not reached at the consultation stage,  the\r\n\r\nmatter will be fixed for hearing.  Both parties are required  to\r\n\r\nattend  the consultation and hearings, if any, at the  Tribunals\r\n\r\npersonally.   The  proposed amendment  to  the  Act  will  allow\r\n\r\nparties  to  claims  to  participate in  the  consultations  and\r\n\r\nhearings  via  a  telephone  or  videophone  link-up  between  a\r\n\r\nRegional Centre and the main Small Claims Tribunals' location at\r\n\r\nthe  Apollo Centre.  This will make it more convenient  for  the\r\n\r\nparties,   especially  those  who  live  near   these   Centres.\r\n\r\nConsultations by telephone and videophone via video-conferencing\r\n\r\nwill  be  for all claims, but hearings will be limited  only  to\r\n\r\nadmissions.  The amendments will provide for safeguards  against\r\n\r\na  situation where a party participating in the consultation  or\r\n\r\nhearing is an impersonator or does not have authority to do  so.\r\n\r\nSir,  new  sections 17A and 22A will be inserted to provide  for\r\n\r\nthis new procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Admission of claims by telephone</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, when a respondent admits a claim, he has to\r\n\r\nattend  the consultation in person to admit to the claim, except\r\n\r\nwhen the claim is settled prior to the consultation.  Similarly,\r\n\r\nif  he wishes to admit to the claim at the hearing stage, he has\r\n\r\nto present himself in person.  The proposed amendment will allow\r\n\r\na respondent to admit claims by telephone at any time before the\r\n\r\nconsultation or hearing stages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has provisions for safeguards against admissions\r\n\r\nby   impersonators  or  unauthorised  persons.    Further,   the\r\n\r\nrespondent  can  apply to set aside consent  orders  made  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  any  admission  made by an  impersonator  or  by  an\r\n\r\nunauthorised  person.  A new section 18A  will  be  inserted  to\r\n\r\nprovide for this new procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Admission of claims in writing</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some respondents have enquired if they can admit claims\r\n\r\nin  writing  and  be excused from attending the consultation  in\r\n\r\nperson.  The present legislation does not provide for admissions\r\n\r\nin  writing.  Respondents have to attend personally  before  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar to admit the claim.  Allowing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadmissions  to  be made in writing will provide  another  medium\r\n\r\nthrough  which respondents can admit claims.  A new section  18A\r\n\r\nwill  be  inserted  to provide for this.  As  a  safeguard,  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  can reject such admissions and direct the  respondent\r\n\r\nto appear in person at the consultation or hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment of Section 38</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 38 of the Act has been amended to allow persons\r\n\r\naggrieved  by  any orders made by the Registrar or the  Tribunal\r\n\r\nunder  the  proposed sections 17(9), 17A(3), 18A(5), 22A(3)  and\r\n\r\n26(1)  to apply to the Tribunal to set aside the orders and  the\r\n\r\nTribunal  is empowered to make such further order as  it  thinks\r\n\r\njust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that the proposed amendments\r\n\r\nwill  improve the administrative efficiency of the Small  Claims\r\n\r\nTribunals  and provide a better service and greater  convenience\r\n\r\nto the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport  the introduction of this amendment Bill.  I  would  say\r\n\r\nthat this is very good progress in terms of making available the\r\n\r\ntechnology  to  aid  the  claims of consumers  and  other  small\r\n\r\nclaimants.  I wish to make some observations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the new section 17A(1) deals with telephone,\r\n\r\nvideophone or any other electronic means.  It states that  these\r\n\r\nmeans  would be allowed for the proceedings of the Small  Claims\r\n\r\nTribunals.  Under the proposed section 22A, some hearings  would\r\n\r\nalso   be  made  using  this  new  modern  means  of  electronic\r\n\r\ncommunications.    But   by   the   principles   of    statutory\r\n\r\ninterpretation, the so-called eiusdem generis principle, general\r\n\r\nwords  used  in a statute will be limited to the same  class  of\r\n\r\ncommunications,  ie, in this case, types of telephones,  because\r\n\r\nof  the  words \"telephone\" and \"videophone\".  This will  exclude\r\n\r\naudio-conferencing where the telephone is not used directly,  or\r\n\r\nvideo-conferencing where the medium of conveying the message  is\r\n\r\nnot a telephone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nline  but, say, a cable or broadcasting and satellite media,  or\r\n\r\neven a set top box placed on top of a television.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask if the Minister would state that such\r\n\r\na limitation is not really the intention of the Bill.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nsome   electronic   means  are  obviously   unsuitable   for   a\r\n\r\nconsultation before the Registrar.  So the words should  not  be\r\n\r\ntoo  broad.  Such electronic means could include e-mail or  even\r\n\r\nif  it  is  instantaneous e-mail, perhaps even fax machines  and\r\n\r\nother modes of telecommunication where the authentication of the\r\n\r\nother  party is susceptible to fraud and impersonation.  I would\r\n\r\nthus  call  on  the Minister to promulgate some  regulations  by\r\n\r\nlaying  down  the  procedures  and  standards  of  security  and\r\n\r\nauthentication  for  such  consultations  and  admissions,   and\r\n\r\ndescribe  the circumstances in which such electronic means  will\r\n\r\nbe  accepted  or rejected for the purposes of the  Small  Claims\r\n\r\nTribunals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under new section 18A(1), admission of a claim can be\r\n\r\nmade  orally by telephone and I would similarly ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  mention the minimum standards and procedures of security for\r\n\r\nsuch means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to new sections 17A(4), 18A(6) and 22A(4), an\r\n\r\napplication to set aside an order of the Registrar must be  made\r\n\r\nwithin  one  month  of  the order.  I am  concerned  about  this\r\n\r\nbecause  I am afraid that in many cases before the Small  Claims\r\n\r\nTribunals, it involves consumers who may not be very savvy as to\r\n\r\nthe  ways  of  court and the ways of the law and  therefore  may\r\n\r\nactually  be  at a disadvantage.  For example, if an  order  has\r\n\r\nbeen made, the party that obtains the order could hold on to the\r\n\r\norder  for  more  than  a  month  and  then  serve  it  on   the\r\n\r\nunsuspecting  consumer, by which time it would be too  late  for\r\n\r\nhim  to set aside and he would have to first ask for leave  from\r\n\r\nthe  tribunals  before he can set aside  the  order.   And  this\r\n\r\nadditional process will actually deter him.  I would ask if  the\r\n\r\nMinister  could  consider regulations that would perhaps  remove\r\n\r\nthis difficulty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would just like to mention that perhaps in future\r\n\r\namendment to the Small Claims Tribunals Act the Minister could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  look  into expansion of the jurisdiction, for example,  in\r\n\r\nhouse  renovations  below $40,000 which is really  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nrenovation that small householders of 3-rooms and 4-rooms  would\r\n\r\nactually do as a basic renovation and these claims are presently\r\n\r\nnot  covered.   Additionally, claims by people who  have  bought\r\n\r\ntime-shares,  because time-shares hover in  this  twilight  zone\r\n\r\nbetween  services and property.  And presently  people  who  are\r\n\r\ntaken  advantage of cannot go to the Small Claims  Tribunals  to\r\n\r\nadvocate their cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I thank Dr Toh for first\r\n\r\nsupporting  the  Bill and also making some observations  on  the\r\n\r\nBill.  Let me respond to these observations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first point is a point for clarification. He\r\n\r\nasked whether the term \"or any other electronic means\" should be\r\n\r\nread  restrictively in accordance with the eiusdem generis rule.\r\n\r\nLet me first say that we are taking this one step at a time.  We\r\n\r\nwill first start with telephones and videophones, and I think we\r\n\r\nwill  use those for some time to assess how they work.  The idea\r\n\r\nhere is to provide for other electronic means that may emerge in\r\n\r\nthe  future.  Therefore, for the sake of clarity, let me say now\r\n\r\nthat  we do not want to circumscribe the new means to which this\r\n\r\nprocess  can  be  adapted, should there be new features  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture,  which can be used to good effect to achieve the objects\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill.  But there must be safeguards as well.  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  is the point he has also made.  So whatever new means that\r\n\r\nare used should garner convenience but at the same time must  be\r\n\r\nbalanced  with adequate safeguards.  So we will start  with  the\r\n\r\ntelephone,  videophone, and perhaps some  time  in  the  future,\r\n\r\nmaybe Internet can be used.  So this is the purport of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he talked about safeguards. I think that is a\r\n\r\nvery  good point.  In fact, this was something we put our  minds\r\n\r\nto.   Because even as we have this new approach, new technology,\r\n\r\nwe  want to ensure that it will not be abused.  For example,  he\r\n\r\nmentioned clause 4, the new section 18A, about admitting by, for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexample, telephone.  The safeguard here will be with the  notice\r\n\r\nof  consultation that will be received by the respondent,  there\r\n\r\nwill be a secret pin number which he will then have to use if he\r\n\r\ntelephones  in to admit the claim.  This will be in addition  to\r\n\r\nthe  other particulars which are peculiar to him, eg, IC number,\r\n\r\nname, and so forth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for consultation and hearing by these new means, we\r\n\r\nare  not jumping straightaway to a situation where you can  have\r\n\r\nconsultation or hearing from your home.  The idea here  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  parties  would  be at the Small Claims Tribunals  locality,\r\n\r\neither  the  main  locality at Apollo  Centre  or  the  regional\r\n\r\ncentre.   So even if there is such consultation by these  means,\r\n\r\nthere  will still be verification of identity of the parties  by\r\n\r\nthe officials at either the regional centre or the main centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point that he has mentioned is about the one-month period. He says that if a person is impersonated, he may\r\n\r\nnot  know  that  he has been impersonated and if  the  one-month\r\n\r\nperiod  runs from the time the order is made, it may be  out  of\r\n\r\ntime.   First, as I have said, safeguards are in place to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there is no impersonation and I am told that this will  be\r\n\r\nrare, but, in any case, we should provide for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the one-month period is not cast in stone.\r\n\r\nBecause if you look at the words, the Registrar can allow for  a\r\n\r\nfurther period, so that should there be unfairness or injustice,\r\n\r\nI   am   sure   the  Registrar  would  exercise  his  discretion\r\n\r\njudiciously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I understand that a copy of the order that is made\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  served  on  the parties,  so  that  if  you  are\r\n\r\nimpersonated,  your address is still there, your name  is  still\r\n\r\nthere,  so you still will get a copy of the order made, and  you\r\n\r\nknow  that  you are impersonated because somebody  has  admitted\r\n\r\nyour claim.  So this should take care of that point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think if all else fails, Dr Toh will know that\r\n\r\nthe  Small  Claims process has improved so much  that  the  time\r\n\r\nperiod  between the time you get the notice and the consultation\r\n\r\nand  hearing,  now it is all within one month.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none-month period, even if all these other measures that  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned fail, will not prejudice the consumer of which I think\r\n\r\nDr Toh is concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point he mentioned is why not expand the\r\n\r\njurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunals.  Let us take this  a\r\n\r\nstep  at  a time.  I think he will know that last year  we  just\r\n\r\nexpanded  it.   Currently  it is $10,000  and  $20,000  if  both\r\n\r\nparties  consent.  So that is already upping the limit from  the\r\n\r\nprevious limit of $2,000 and $5,000.  So I think we should  take\r\n\r\nthis  gradually.  We do not want to lose sight of the objectives\r\n\r\nbehind the Small Claims Tribunals which is to ensure that  small\r\n\r\nclaims  which do not require examination of complex legal issues\r\n\r\ncan  be dealt with quickly by Referees and Registrars.  So  even\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  the  type of claims that  can  be  heard  by  the\r\n\r\nTribunals, we are very careful not to expand it too quickly.   I\r\n\r\nthink we should let this new innovation take off and then we can\r\n\r\nassess over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Assoc.

There are a total of five tax changes  which\r\n\r\nrequire amendment to the Act.  I will start with the tax changes\r\n\r\naffecting individual taxpayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have announced that, with effect from Year of Assessment\r\n\r\n1998, there will be an increase in tax reliefs for taxpayers who\r\n\r\nmaintain  dependants.  For those who stay with aged  parents  in\r\n\r\nthe  same  household,  parent relief is raised  from  $3,500  to\r\n\r\n$4,500.   There is also an increase in tax relief  for  wife  as\r\n\r\nwell as child relief from $1,500 to $2,000.  In addition, I have\r\n\r\nalso  relaxed  the income ceiling condition for  eligibility  of\r\n\r\nparent  relief,  wife  relief, handicapped siblings  relief  and\r\n\r\nchild relief.  The respective reliefs will be allowed so long as\r\n\r\nthe  dependant does not have an income exceeding $2,000 in  that\r\n\r\nyear, instead of the current level of $1,500.  Clauses 11 and 16\r\n\r\namend the relevant sections of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also announced that with effect from 1st January\r\n\r\n1999,   all  CPF  contributions,  whether  made  voluntary,   or\r\n\r\nobligatory under contracts of employment, will no longer be  tax\r\n\r\ndeductible for both the employee and the employer.  In addition,\r\n\r\nthe  employer's contribution will be taxable as  income  in  the\r\n\r\nhands   of   the   employee.   However,  in   support   of   the\r\n\r\nregionalisation programme, the existing tax treatment will still\r\n\r\napply  to  Singaporeans posted overseas who make  voluntary  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.   Clauses 2, 4 and 7 amend the relevant  sections\r\n\r\nof the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two tax changes pertain to existing tax\r\n\r\nconcessions.   Since  the  Year of Assessment  1992,  banks  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to claim tax deduction for general provisions made  for\r\n\r\nloans  and  investments in securities.  To  encourage  banks  to\r\n\r\nincrease their level of general provisions to buffer against any\r\n\r\nunexpected losses, I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraised  the limit on tax deductible general provisions from  two\r\n\r\nper  cent to three per cent of qualifying loans and investments.\r\n\r\nClause  8  amends section 14I to provide for this  change  which\r\n\r\nwill take effect from Year of Assessment 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also announced that the tax holiday granted to the\r\n\r\nSingapore Commodity Exchange Limited (SICOM) in 1992,  for  five\r\n\r\nyears, will be extended for another five years.  Clause 6 amends\r\n\r\nsection 13(1)(p) for the extension of this tax holiday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to encourage the setting up of reputable credit\r\n\r\nrating  agencies in Singapore, I have announced a  concessionary\r\n\r\ntax  of  10  per  cent on income derived from  providing  credit\r\n\r\nrating  services  with respect to the issue of foreign  currency\r\n\r\ndenominated securities in Singapore.  Clause 14 introduces a new\r\n\r\nsection  43M for this incentive which will take effect from  the\r\n\r\nYear of Assessment 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Changes not announced in the 1997 Budget Statement</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the three tax changes that were not\r\n\r\nannounced in the 1997 Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tax change pertains to the computation of gains\r\n\r\nderived  from the exercise of share options.  The gains  derived\r\n\r\nby  an  employee from the exercise of share options issued under\r\n\r\nthe  Employee Share Options Scheme are taxable.  At present, the\r\n\r\nvaluation  rule  used  to determine the  taxable  gains  is  the\r\n\r\ndifference between (a) the price of the share in the open market\r\n\r\nat  the  time of the exercise of the option; and (b) the  amount\r\n\r\nthe employee had paid for such shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is usually an interval between the exercise\r\n\r\ndate  and  the  date  on  which the shares  subscribed  for  are\r\n\r\napproved  by and listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore.   As\r\n\r\nthe  shares are only tradable when it is listed, clause 3 amends\r\n\r\nsection  10(5)  to  provide  that the  taxable  gains  shall  be\r\n\r\ncomputed as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifference between the price of the shares when it is listed and\r\n\r\nthe amount paid for the shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second tax change deals with the treatment of capital\r\n\r\nallowances  and losses from the leasing of machinery and  plant.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Act provides that if a lessor carries out finance\r\n\r\nlease activities, he can only set off the capital allowances  of\r\n\r\na  finance  lease  asset  against his income  derived  from  the\r\n\r\nfinance  leasing.  This is to prevent finance leasing activities\r\n\r\nfrom  being  used as a tax shelter.  As a result of the  current\r\n\r\nwording  of  the  Act, the unabsorbed capital  allowances  of  a\r\n\r\nfinance  lease  asset will be forfeited when the  finance  lease\r\n\r\nbusiness ceased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the current tax treatment is unduly restrictive, I have\r\n\r\ndecided  to  amend  the  Act to allow  such  unabsorbed  capital\r\n\r\nallowances to be set off against any other income of the  lessor\r\n\r\nwhen  there  is  a  permanent cessation  of  his  finance  lease\r\n\r\nbusiness.  As a consequence of this change, and since a  leasing\r\n\r\ncompany  can  carry  out both onshore and  offshore  finance  or\r\n\r\noperating  lease  activities, the amendments also  set  out  the\r\n\r\nmanner  of  setting off capital allowances and losses  for  such\r\n\r\nleasing  companies.  These changes to the treatment  of  capital\r\n\r\nallowances  and losses from the leasing of machinery  and  plant\r\n\r\nare provided for under clauses 5 and 13 which amend sections 10D\r\n\r\nand 43I respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the last amendment concerns the claiming of\r\n\r\ncapital   allowances   for  motor  cars  registered   and   used\r\n\r\nexclusively outside Singapore.  At present, owners of a  Q-plate\r\n\r\ncar  are  allowed  to claim capital allowances for  their  cars.\r\n\r\nSimilar  tax  treatment is also applicable  to  cars  registered\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore and used exclusively outside  Singapore.   An\r\n\r\nexample  of the latter would be cars used by an overseas  branch\r\n\r\nof  a  Singapore company.  However, while owners of Q-plate cars\r\n\r\nare  given  balancing allowances upon the disposal of the  cars,\r\n\r\nowners  of the above mentioned foreign cars are not entitled  to\r\n\r\nany  balancing allowance.  To rectify this inconsistency, clause\r\n\r\n9  amends section 20(5A) to allow balancing allowances upon  the\r\n\r\ndisposal of such foreign cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year \"1997\" will be changed to\r\n\r\n\"1998\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 17 inclusive ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and\r\n\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INTERPRETATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Interpretation Act (Chapter 1\r\n\r\nof the 1997 Revised Edition) to provide criteria for determining\r\n\r\nwhen  death occurs, and to make consequential amendments to  the\r\n\r\nHuman  Organ  Transplant Act (Chapter 131A of the  1988  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition)  and the Medical (Therapy, Education and Research)  Act\r\n\r\n(Chapter 175 of the 1985 Revised Edition).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, traditionally, death is considered to have taken place\r\n\r\nwhen  a  person's  heart beat and respiration  cease.   This  is\r\n\r\ntermed  by the medical profession as \"cardiac death\".   However,\r\n\r\nthis  concept  of death can no longer be applied in  every  case\r\n\r\nnowadays   because   of  advances  in  medical   treatment   and\r\n\r\ntechnology.   In  particular, resuscitative and life  supportive\r\n\r\ntechnology has enabled a patient's heart beat and respiration to\r\n\r\nbe  maintained indefinitely, even when there is not the remotest\r\n\r\npossibility of the patient's brain ever functioning again.   The\r\n\r\nresult is a warm corpse with a beating heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last two to three decades, \"brain death\" has been\r\n\r\naccepted  by the medical fraternity worldwide as a more  precise\r\n\r\ndeterminant  of death.  The common law has accepted the  concept\r\n\r\nof  brain death.  There is, however, no certainty in the  common\r\n\r\nlaw  on the criteria and tests to be applied before brain  death\r\n\r\ncan  be  certified.  Therefore, when the Human Organ  Transplant\r\n\r\nAct  (HOTA) was enacted in 1987, death was defined according  to\r\n\r\nthe brain death criteria in the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOTA is currently the only legislation in Singapore which\r\n\r\ncontains  a definition of death.  HOTA, however, has  a  limited\r\n\r\nscope  of  application.   It  is only applicable  to  non-Muslim\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, 21 to 60 years old, who had not objected to kidney\r\n\r\ndonation  and  who died as a result of an accident.   The  brain\r\n\r\ndeath criteria as defined in HOTA have been applied for the past\r\n\r\n10  years in Singapore and have gained public acceptance.  It is\r\n\r\ntherefore  timely to legislate a definition of the criterion  of\r\n\r\ndeath  that  would  be  applicable for  all  deaths.   The  main\r\n\r\nobjective of this Bill is to provide a legal definition of death\r\n\r\nthat  would  allow  doctors  to use  either  the  cardiac  death\r\n\r\ncriteria or brain death criteria to determine when death  occurs\r\n\r\nunder any circumstances.  This would allow for the determination\r\n\r\nof death to be made in a consistent fashion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me briefly explain why there is a need to define\r\n\r\nprecisely  the  time  of death.  Firstly, techniques  have  been\r\n\r\ndeveloped   for   the  prolonged  maintenance  of   circulation,\r\n\r\nventilation,  alimentation, and excretion of the human  body  by\r\n\r\nartificial  means.   This  makes  possible  the  creation  of  a\r\n\r\nsituation  in  which  the bodily functions continue  to  operate\r\n\r\nwhile  the  brain  is dead, and the person is for  all  purposes\r\n\r\n\"dead\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the increasing use of organs, such as kidney,\r\n\r\nliver  and heart, for transplantation, requires an accurate  and\r\n\r\ntimely  determination of when the donor has  died  so  that  the\r\n\r\norgans  may be removed.  In addition, numerous other  legal  and\r\n\r\nsocial  considerations require a precise and  definite  decision\r\n\r\nthat death has occurred.  For example, the family of a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbrain  dead  person  can  be  spared  unnecessary  anguish   and\r\n\r\nfinancial  burden if brain death is determined and  the  patient\r\n\r\ncertified as legally dead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now highlight the major new\r\n\r\nprovisions that are being introduced in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Criteria for Determining Death</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide for the criteria for determining death for all\r\n\r\npurposes, clause 2 inserts a new section 2A which states that  a\r\n\r\nperson has died when there has occurred either:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) irreversible cessation of circulation of blood and\r\n\r\nrespiration  in  the body of a person (referred  hereinafter  as\r\n\r\n\"cardiac death\"); or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) total and irreversible cessation of all functions of\r\n\r\nthe brain of a person (referred hereinafter as \"brain death\").\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In about 95% of all cases, cardiac death precedes brain\r\n\r\ndeath and can be readily diagnosed without elaborate tests.   As\r\n\r\nthis  is the simple means of certifying death, there is no  need\r\n\r\nfor  a set of criteria to be prescribed by law.  Only one doctor\r\n\r\nis  necessary to certify cardiac death except where an organ  is\r\n\r\nto be removed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination of brain death on the other hand will be\r\n\r\nin  accordance with the clinical criteria as prescribed  in  the\r\n\r\nregulations  under the new section 2A.  These criteria  for  the\r\n\r\ndetermination of brain death will be the same as those currently\r\n\r\nprescribed  in  the  HOTA Regulations.   These  criteria  are  a\r\n\r\nrefinement  of  the  diagnostic criteria for establishing  death\r\n\r\nwhich  were  unanimously  adopted  by  the  Royal  Colleges  and\r\n\r\nFaculties of the United Kingdom in 1976.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the many criteria required for determining brain\r\n\r\ndeath and to ensure absolute certainty, all cases of brain death\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  certified in the prescribed form  by  two  medical\r\n\r\npractitioners   who  possess  prescribed  postgraduate   medical\r\n\r\nqualifications.  Also, one of the two certifying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoctors must not have been involved in the care or treatment  of\r\n\r\nthe person certified to be brain dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Additional Provisions in an Organ Donation Situation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are additional provisions in the Interpretation Act\r\n\r\nwhere death is to be certified in a potential organ donor.  This\r\n\r\nis  to  assure  the  family  and the community  that  there  are\r\n\r\nadequate  safeguards to prevent untimely removal of the  donor's\r\n\r\norgan.   For  deaths which result in the removal of  organs  for\r\n\r\ntransplant  purposes, two medical practitioners are required  to\r\n\r\ncertify  the  death  in  a prescribed  form.   The  two  doctors\r\n\r\ncertifying cardiac or brain death should not have been  involved\r\n\r\nin  the  care of the donor and in the selection of the  proposed\r\n\r\nrecipient.   They should also not participate in the  harvesting\r\n\r\nand  transplant  operations  and after-care  of  the  recipient.\r\n\r\nThese requirements have been included to ensure independence  of\r\n\r\nthe determination of death and to guard against any conflict  of\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Circumstances where Certification of Death would not be Possible</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain circumstances where it may not be\r\n\r\npossible  to  produce  the corpse as physical  evidence  that  a\r\n\r\nperson has died.  One example would be if a ship were to sink in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  manner as to make recovery of the bodies of the trapped\r\n\r\ncrew  not  possible.   These  special  circumstances  have  been\r\n\r\naddressed under existing laws.  In order to avoid doubt,  it  is\r\n\r\nmade  clear  that  the  new  section 2A  shall  not  affect  the\r\n\r\noperation of section 110 of the Evidence Act which addresses the\r\n\r\nburden of proving that a person is alive who has not been  heard\r\n\r\nof for seven years.  It shall also not affect section 100 of the\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter which addresses proceedings for decree nisi  on\r\n\r\npresumption  of  death  and divorce or  any  other  written  law\r\n\r\nrelating to the presumption of death.  It will also not  prevent\r\n\r\nthe  certification or determination of death in a case where the\r\n\r\nbody of a person is not found or recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consequential Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by having a definition of death for all purposes\r\n\r\nincorporated  in the Interpretation Act, it will  no  longer  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  to define death in any other legislation.   The  Bill\r\n\r\nproposes  that the relevant section and subsection in HOTA  will\r\n\r\nbe  repealed and deleted respectively.  A minor change  will  be\r\n\r\nmade  to the Medical Therapy Act to ensure consistency with  the\r\n\r\nInterpretation Act where determination of death is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, doctors have been certifying death since time\r\n\r\nimmemorial.  The traditional common law definition of  death  is\r\n\r\nthe  cessation  of  circulatory  and  respiratory  functions  or\r\n\r\ncardiac  death.   We  have had a decade of experience  with  the\r\n\r\nbrain  death definition since HOTA was implemented.  The concept\r\n\r\nof  brain death has gained general public acceptance.  We should\r\n\r\nno  longer  limit  the  use of the brain  death  criteria  as  a\r\n\r\ndefinition  of death just to organ donors under HOTA.   The  law\r\n\r\nmust  allow  the doctors to certify death when a person's  brain\r\n\r\nhas ceased functioning totally and irreversibly, even though the\r\n\r\nheart  is  kept  beating through artificial  means.   This  will\r\n\r\nredress an anomalous situation created by medical science.  When\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  is  passed  it  would allow for  either  brain  death\r\n\r\ncriteria or cardiac death criteria to be applied for all  deaths\r\n\r\nincluding organ donors under HOTA and the Medical Therapy Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, death is mentioned more than 1,200 times in the\r\n\r\nSingapore statutes, and yet it is only defined in HOTA.  What is\r\n\r\nbeing  proposed  in  this Bill is not a new way  of  determining\r\n\r\ndeath,  but  a legislative definition of death for all  purposes\r\n\r\nwhich   formalises  what  is  the  currently  accepted   medical\r\n\r\npractice.   Even so, I propose to refer this Bill  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee to ensure that an opportunity be given for members  of\r\n\r\nthe public to express their views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting\r\n\r\nof  Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven Members to be nominated  by\r\n\r\nthe Committee of Selection. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PLANNING BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is to replace the existing Planning Act which has\r\n\r\nessentially  the  same  provisions  as  those  of  the  Planning\r\n\r\nOrdinance  of 1959.  Various amendments have been  made  to  the\r\n\r\nexisting  Act  over the years to reflect administrative  changes\r\n\r\nand  to  meet prevailing circumstances.   However, after such  a\r\n\r\nlong  time, significant changes in the Planning Process and  the\r\n\r\npresent  state  of  the physical development of  Singapore  have\r\n\r\nnecessitated an updating of the Act.  I shall now go through and\r\n\r\nexplain the rationale for the main changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Definition of \"Master Plan\"</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the term \"Master Plan\" in the existing Act has two\r\n\r\ndifferent  definitions.  Each definition has a different  usage.\r\n\r\nThis has caused confusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first definition, retained in clause 6 of the Bill,\r\n\r\nmeans  the  original  Master  Plan  approved  in  1958  and  all\r\n\r\nsubsequent approved amendments to the Plan.  This \"Master  Plan\"\r\n\r\nrefers to the approved development or planning intention  for  a\r\n\r\nsite  and  is  used  to evaluate whether a proposed  development\r\n\r\ncould be allowed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second definition, in section 32(4) of the existing\r\n\r\nAct, refers to the paid-up development rights of a site for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of determining development charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To distinguish the two clearly, we now propose to replace\r\n\r\nthe  second definition of the term \"Master Plan\" with a new term\r\n\r\n\"Development Baseline\" in clause 36 of the Bill to describe  the\r\n\r\nbase value more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccurately.   This is only a change in nomenclature  which  does\r\n\r\nnot result in any change in substance or in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Development Ceiling</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a developer submits a proposal for the development of\r\n\r\na  site,  there will be a value associated with it depending  on\r\n\r\nfactors  like  the  usage and intensity.  There  is  a  need  to\r\n\r\nintroduce a new term \"Development Ceiling\" to reflect this value\r\n\r\nfor development charge purposes.  The development charge payable\r\n\r\nwill then be the difference between the Development Ceiling  and\r\n\r\nthe  Development  Baseline  for  a  site.   Again,  this  is   a\r\n\r\ndefinitional change which does not result in any change  to  the\r\n\r\npresent basis of determining development charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Deviations from the Master Plan</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now move on to the provisions of the Master Plan.\r\n\r\nThe  competent  authority  in  determining  an  application  for\r\n\r\nwritten  permission  is required to act in conformity  with  the\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan.  However, occasionally, the zoning of an  area  in\r\n\r\nthe  Master Plan may become obsolete due to changes in  planning\r\n\r\nintentions.   The Development Guide Plans (DGPs),  for  example,\r\n\r\nmay  have proposed new ideas which are different from the Master\r\n\r\nPlan.   Similarly,  some  sites  may  be  affected  by  on-going\r\n\r\nplanning   reviews  of  the  whole  locality  or  transportation\r\n\r\nstudies.   Other  sites may be required to be  used  for  public\r\n\r\npurposes,    like   the   provision   of   infrastructural    or\r\n\r\ntransportation facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is thus now made in clause 14 to allow the\r\n\r\ncompetent  authority the flexibility to deviate from the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan when dealing with applications for written permission,  but\r\n\r\nonly  in  very  limited circumstances such  as  those  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier, and with the prior approval of the Minister.  This will\r\n\r\nensure  that  confidence  of the Master  Plan  as  a  guide  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment is maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Payment of Development Charge</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill allows the competent authority to introduce a two-stage procedure for the payment of development charge. At\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent,  the  exact  amount of development  charge  has  to  be\r\n\r\ndetermined  and paid up before planning permission is  released.\r\n\r\nAs  much  time  is needed to check the detailed calculations  to\r\n\r\ndetermine the actual amount of development charge payable,  this\r\n\r\nhas sometimes caused delays in the issue of planning permission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is therefore now to allow an estimated amount of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  charge  to be collected first  through  an  interim\r\n\r\norder,  so  that  planning or conservation permission  could  be\r\n\r\nreleased  early.   A  final  order  for  the  actual  amount  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  charge  could subsequently be collected  within  12\r\n\r\nmonths  of the grant of the planning or conservation permission.\r\n\r\nThis is provided for in clause 38 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Vesting of land for public purpose</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry would like to take the\r\n\r\nopportunity of this Bill to formalise an established practice of\r\n\r\nthe competent authority on the vesting of land to be used for  a\r\n\r\npublic  purpose.   Where  necessary, a condition  requiring  the\r\n\r\nvesting  of  part  of the land to the State for public  purposes\r\n\r\nlike road widening or drainage reserves is currently imposed  in\r\n\r\nthe planning permission.  This is now explicitly provided for in\r\n\r\nclause 15(1)(f) of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House that the owner of the land\r\n\r\ndoes  not  suffer  any  loss as he is allowed  to  transfer  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment rights of the land vested to the remaining  part  of\r\n\r\nhis land, subject to the planning requirements of the site.  The\r\n\r\ncondition  to  vest land to the State will only  be  limited  to\r\n\r\nrequirements of public purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Provision of Links and Connections to Adjacent Developments and Public Facilities</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another public facility requirement is the provision of\r\n\r\nlinks  and connections to adjacent developments or MRT stations.\r\n\r\nThese   are   usually  secured  as  and  when   development   or\r\n\r\nredevelopment takes place.  The competent authority  has,  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  established practice, been requiring  developers  to\r\n\r\nprovide these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlinks  and  connections to create a network  of  pedestrian  and\r\n\r\nvehicular  links  within  the city.   Besides  formalising  this\r\n\r\npractice,  clause  15(1)(h) enables the competent  authority  to\r\n\r\nrequire  a  developer to maintain and keep open these facilities\r\n\r\nto  allow  free access by the public as a condition of  planning\r\n\r\npermission.   It also makes clear that such conditions  will  be\r\n\r\nimposed only for the provision of such connections to facilitate\r\n\r\npublic access and movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enforcement Powers</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now go through the amendments relating to\r\n\r\nenforcement.   The  current  Planning  Act  does   not   provide\r\n\r\nsufficient powers for the competent authority to carry  out  its\r\n\r\nenforcement  work effectively and efficiently.  The  fines  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  updated  and  are grossly  inadequate.   It  is  thus\r\n\r\nnecessary to enhance the enforcement provisions and penalties in\r\n\r\nthe Bill.  I shall now elaborate on the main changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competent authority's investigation into a complaint is\r\n\r\noften  hampered  by  a lack of information, either  because  the\r\n\r\nowner or occupier cannot be found, or the premises are locked at\r\n\r\nthe time of inspection.  To improve efficiency and enable faster\r\n\r\nresponse  to  complaints, my Ministry has agreed  to  allow  the\r\n\r\ncompetent  authority  to serve an \"information  notice\"  on  the\r\n\r\nowner  or occupier of the land.  This will compel him to furnish\r\n\r\ninformation on the activities to facilitate investigation and to\r\n\r\nstop  breaches  of planning control.  This is  provided  for  in\r\n\r\nclause  25  of the Bill.  There are penalties for not  complying\r\n\r\nwith the information notice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URA enforcement officers are sometimes required to carry\r\n\r\nout  their investigation beyond the normal working hours.   This\r\n\r\nis  because  illegal activities are not always conducted  during\r\n\r\nnormal  working hours.  Clause 27 allows the competent authority\r\n\r\nto  enter  the land or building for inspection at any reasonable\r\n\r\ntime, instead of only in the day time as provided in the current\r\n\r\nAct.   It  also allows the authority to require the occupier  of\r\n\r\nthe land to furnish his identity to enable the authority to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nidentify  the  person  responsible for the  breach  of  planning\r\n\r\ncontrol.  This provision will enable the competent authority  to\r\n\r\nact upon complaints expeditiously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28, 29 and 30 of the Bill deal with enforcement\r\n\r\nnotices and appeals against enforcement notices.  Often, URA had\r\n\r\nbeen  asked to enforce against illegal activities which  disturb\r\n\r\nthe  neighbourhood.  The complainants have often expressed their\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction with the long period taken by URA  to  stop  the\r\n\r\nnuisance  activities.  The proposal therefore is to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nminimum period for the enforcement notice to take effect from 28\r\n\r\ndays to 14 days.  This should bring about more timely action  to\r\n\r\nstop  such  illegal activities.  This is provided for in  clause\r\n\r\n28.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An appeal can be made to the Minister against an\r\n\r\nenforcement notice, during which time the enforcement notice  is\r\n\r\nsuspended.  From experience, some of the appeals have been  over\r\n\r\ntechnical  inaccuracies in the enforcement  notice.   When  such\r\n\r\nappeals are allowed, a fresh enforcement notice has to be served\r\n\r\nall  over  again.   Much time and effort are  wasted  while  the\r\n\r\nillegal   activities   persist,  to   the   annoyance   of   the\r\n\r\ncomplainants.   In  order not to delay the enforcement  process,\r\n\r\nprovision  is  now made in clause 29 to allow  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\ncorrect   any  error  in  the  enforcement  notice,   vary   its\r\n\r\nrequirements, or allow for more time for compliance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure due compliance with the enforcement notice by the\r\n\r\nend  of such extended time, provision is also made in clause  29\r\n\r\nto  allow the Minister to require security to be furnished as  a\r\n\r\ncondition  for allowing the extension of time.  This can  be  in\r\n\r\nthe form of a banker's guarantee, which will be forfeited if the\r\n\r\nillegal  activities  still persist at the end  of  the  extended\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 30 provides for enhanced penalties for non-compliance with enforcement notices. The current maximum fine\r\n\r\nis $3,000.  However, in many cases, the fines range from $600 to\r\n\r\n$2,000.   These  are  insufficient  to  deter  an  offender,  as\r\n\r\nplanning  offences  could result in very  substantial  financial\r\n\r\ngains to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffenders.   Even after conviction, some recalcitrant  offenders\r\n\r\nrefuse to comply with the enforcement notice and are willing  to\r\n\r\npay the daily fine that, in most cases, ranges from $10 to $50 a\r\n\r\nday.  My Ministry thus finds it necessary to increase the  fines\r\n\r\nto  a  maximum of $200,000 or an imprisonment of up to 12 months\r\n\r\nor  both  under clause 30.  The fine for continuing offences  is\r\n\r\nalso  to  be increased from $100 per day to a maximum of $10,000\r\n\r\nper day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, the competent authority is required to take\r\n\r\nspeedy  enforcement  action in urgent  cases  to  avoid  further\r\n\r\ndamage  caused by unauthorised uses and activities on the  land.\r\n\r\nExamples are illegal excavation or dumping of earth.  Clause  33\r\n\r\nallows  the  competent authority to apply for a court injunction\r\n\r\nto  quickly  restrain an actual or impending breach of  planning\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were occasions when URA had to consider the\r\n\r\nregularisation   of   unauthorised   building   extensions.   To\r\n\r\ndiscourage  developers or architects from trying their  luck  by\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  works without prior permission of  the  competent\r\n\r\nauthority,  clause  34 provides for a new penalty  which  cannot\r\n\r\nexceed  either 50 times the prescribed application fees for  the\r\n\r\nrelevant permission or $150,000, whichever is lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other changes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two other changes to the existing Act which\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to mention.  There have been feedback  that  the\r\n\r\ncurrent requirement of having to obtain subdivision approval for\r\n\r\nany  lease of more than seven years of any part of a development\r\n\r\nhas  inhibited business operations.  The Ministry of Law and  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  have  reviewed this and have agreed  to  exempt  lease\r\n\r\nperiods  of  up  to  14  years  for  certain  developments  from\r\n\r\nsubdivision  approval.    This  change  will  give   owners   of\r\n\r\nbuildings  the  flexibility  to grant  longer  leases  of  their\r\n\r\ndevelopment  without  having  to  subdivide  their  development.\r\n\r\nClause 4(2) allows for this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another change relates to the existing requirement for two\r\n\r\nseparate permissions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  obtained for the restoration of conservation  buildings;\r\n\r\none  for  the development works and one for the minor decorative\r\n\r\nworks.   To simplify the process and improve efficiency,  clause\r\n\r\n12  of the Bill requires only one \"conservation permission\"  for\r\n\r\nall  works  within  a  conservation area, including  development\r\n\r\nworks.   For  developments  outside  a  conservation  area,  the\r\n\r\npermission required will be called \"planning permission\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Related Amendments to the Residential Property Act</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 64 relates to the proposed section 28A of the\r\n\r\nResidential Property Act.  It requires a foreign person who owns\r\n\r\nvacant land originally zoned non-residential in the Master  Plan\r\n\r\nbut  which  was  subsequently  rezoned  to  residential  at  the\r\n\r\ninitiative  of  the  competent authority  to  first  obtain  the\r\n\r\napproval  of  the  Minister  for  Law  before  he  applies   for\r\n\r\npermission  to  develop  that land for  a  residential  purpose.\r\n\r\nThis  is  intended to prevent the foreign owner from  by-passing\r\n\r\nthe  normal controls imposed under the Residential Property  Act\r\n\r\nfor foreign ownership of residential property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, due to the different nomenclature used for\r\n\r\ncomputing development charges, a consequential amendment is also\r\n\r\nmade  to the Land Acquisition Act.  Compensation under that  Act\r\n\r\nwill  be determined with regard to the Development Baseline  and\r\n\r\nnot the Master Plan which in future will be the document showing\r\n\r\nfuture planning intention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Bill will simplify and clarify the various\r\n\r\nprovisions in the existing Planning Act as well as to  make  the\r\n\r\nnew  Act  more structured and comprehensible.   Other  than  the\r\n\r\nprovisions to enhance the enforcement  power, the other parts do\r\n\r\nnot  result in changes to current practices.  Rather, they  make\r\n\r\nthe provisions and the powers clearer and more explicit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\never  since  late  1822 when Stamford Raffles  formed  the  Town\r\n\r\nCommittee to prepare a plan for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore, we have had planning law.  Of course, then, the  plan\r\n\r\nwas  exceedingly simple. There were separate ethnic  enclaves  - European,  Chinese,  Indian,  Arab  and  Malay.   Singapore  has\r\n\r\nundergone  great  changes over the course of  the  century.  The\r\n\r\nPlanning  Bill  is  timely as Singapore prepares  for  the  next\r\n\r\ncentury   with  regional  centres,  cultural  and  entertainment\r\n\r\ncentres  and international investment hubs.  At the  same  time,\r\n\r\nthere is the aim of preserving our Asian identity and conserving\r\n\r\nour  heritage.   There is no doubt, therefore,  that  we  should\r\n\r\nsupport  a  new  Planning  Act to allow  the  Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  authorities to fulfil the task of making  Singapore  a\r\n\r\nworld-class city with Asian qualities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critical to this exercise is the Master Plan which,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the Bill, will be reviewed every five  years  and\r\n\r\nwhere  such  a  review  may include re-zoning,  change  of  plot\r\n\r\nratios, designation of conservation areas.  My concern is mainly\r\n\r\nin  the  introduction of the new provision  in  clause  14  that\r\n\r\nallows  the competent authority to deviate from the Master  Plan\r\n\r\nin  certain circumstances.  While I agree that such a  provision\r\n\r\nmay be necessary to provide flexibility and adaptability, it may\r\n\r\nalso  result  in  uncertainty  and,  indeed,  monetary  loss  in\r\n\r\nsituations  where  persons may have acted  in  reliance  on  the\r\n\r\nMaster Plan only to find that the matter is under review and re-zoned.   If,  for example, land is re-zoned from  industrial  to\r\n\r\nresidential  use, the occupier or owner may find  that  he  will\r\n\r\nneed  to incur additional cost in developing it to its new  use.\r\n\r\nA  foreign  investor may find, for example, that land originally\r\n\r\nacquired  or  bought  for  industrial  use  may  be  changed  to\r\n\r\nresidential  use  and  he  may  have  to  apply  for  additional\r\n\r\nconditions  to be imposed on him because it is residential  land\r\n\r\nand  is  subject to the requirements of the Residential Property\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, commercial transactions require certainty. Clause 14\r\n\r\nprovides for situations where there may be uncertainty.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  can provide some clarification as  to  how  these\r\n\r\nuncertainties will be minimised through procedures that  provide\r\n\r\nadvance notice of any review or study that is being conducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also particularly struck by the width of one sub-clause, clause 14(2)(C), where the competent authority need not\r\n\r\nfollow  the Master Plan simply because the relevant land or  its\r\n\r\nlocality is being reviewed by the same authority.  This can be a\r\n\r\ncatch-all phrase that really makes the other sub-clauses, in  my\r\n\r\nview,  redundant.  I hope that the Minister can assure the House\r\n\r\nthat  the  new  powers to deviate from the Master Plan  will  be\r\n\r\ncarefully considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nBill.  However, there are some clauses of the Bill which I would\r\n\r\nlike the Minister to reconsider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, clause 33, Sir. As the Bill stands now, only\r\n\r\nthe  High  Court can grant an injunction.  The Minister  may  be\r\n\r\naware  that now the District Court is granting injunction and  I\r\n\r\nsee  no  reason  why we should burden the High Court,  which  is\r\n\r\nalready burdened with other cases, with this provision.  We  all\r\n\r\nknow  that it is cheaper and easier to make application  in  the\r\n\r\nDistrict  Court.  I can understand that when the  provision  was\r\n\r\nfirst  enacted,  there was a limitation  in  the  power  of  the\r\n\r\nDistrict  Court.  But we have moved a great deal.  In fact,  now\r\n\r\nthe  District Court can  grant an injunction.  I would urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to reconsider the position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clause that I am concerned about also involves\r\n\r\nthe  power of the court as well.  Under clause 48, the  District\r\n\r\nCourt's  power is only when the sum does not exceed  $1,000.   I\r\n\r\nchecked  in the library yesterday and found that it was  a  very\r\n\r\nold  provision when the power of the District Court was  limited\r\n\r\nto  $1,000.   As of today, it is $250,000.  Would  the  Minister\r\n\r\nreconsider this position?  Otherwise, the public would be put to\r\n\r\ngreat  expense  in  going to the High Court  and  lawyers  would\r\n\r\ncharge  higher fees.  It is time-consuming and I think the  High\r\n\r\nCourt's time would also be wasted.  It is more expensive to have\r\n\r\nHigh  Court judges than District Court judges.  So I would  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to reconsider this position.  He has increased the\r\n\r\nfines which, I agree with him, should have been increased.   But\r\n\r\nhe  has not increased the jurisdiction in other clauses.   So  I\r\n\r\nwould urge him to reconsider this position, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the other provisions, but I have only two\r\n\r\nobservations.   On  conservation, we are all aware  how  it  has\r\n\r\nworked  and enhanced the physical beauty of Singapore.  We  have\r\n\r\nvarious  places like Tanjong Pagar where we have  a  mixture  of\r\n\r\nresidential and commercial buildings.  I have one request to ask\r\n\r\nof the Minister.  Would he consider in certain cases a shophouse\r\n\r\nwhich  has got two usages: one shopping unit downstairs and  you\r\n\r\nhave  a  residential office upstairs.  Would he be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nallow sub-divisions so that the owner, if necessary, could  sell\r\n\r\nthe  property  or sub-lease for, say, 30 or 60 years?   I  think\r\n\r\nthis would help in the already depressed property market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to urge the Minister to get his officials\r\n\r\nto  try  to  conserve as many properties as possible.  Otherwise\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  properties  would be  lost  forever.   We  should\r\n\r\nconserve  some  schools, some hospitals  and  even  some  police\r\n\r\nstations.   I think we should not repeat the mistake of  earlier\r\n\r\ntimes where a lot of properties were pulled down.   Later on, we\r\n\r\ncould  decide if we really require this property or not.  But  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge the Minister to consider this and ask his  officials\r\n\r\nto act fast on this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we can pride ourselves as a people who have\r\n\r\nmaintained  our conserved properties well and we  should  ensure\r\n\r\nthat these properties are well preserved in such a way that they\r\n\r\nwould help to beautify Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  support  this Bill that is placed before the House.   In  my\r\n\r\nview,  the  amendments are both timely and  appropriate.  Timely\r\n\r\nbecause,  for  example,  the Bill has  taken  into  account  new\r\n\r\ntechnologies such as electronic filing.  It is also timely  that\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  now  provides the statutory basis  for  many  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  policies  and  practices.  It  appears  to  be  better\r\n\r\norganised and shows greater clarity in its provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also more explicit explanations on the\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  sub-division,  grant  of  provisional  permission,\r\n\r\ndetailed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplanning  permission  and  new definition  on  the  concepts  of\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Baseline and Development Ceiling in the computation\r\n\r\nof  development  charge.   These, I believe,  will  provide  for\r\n\r\ngreater  clarity and certainty for professionals and  developers\r\n\r\nalike.   It  is  also  appropriate,  Sir,  that  the  Bill   now\r\n\r\neliminates  many  of  the functions mentioned  in  the  colonial\r\n\r\nadministration  which have long gone out of use.   I  compliment\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for the use of the language in the Bill  which  is\r\n\r\nmore  modern  and suited to present day use and more  structured\r\n\r\nfor  easy  reference.   I support the increase  in  the  maximum\r\n\r\npenalties  for unauthorised subdivision, developments and  other\r\n\r\nworks  from $3,000 to $200,000 as it is in keeping with  present\r\n\r\nday cost and will have a more deterrent impact and effectiveness\r\n\r\nin  view  of  the  higher cost of development. Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\nbreaches of such planning controls must be made punitive in view\r\n\r\nof the potential impact to public health and safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the extension from seven to 14 years for the\r\n\r\nexemption  from  requiring subdivision approval for  residential\r\n\r\nand non-residential leases.  This, I believe, is consistent with\r\n\r\nexisting  practice of having longer leases for  better  business\r\n\r\nplanning and in view of higher renovation cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditional permission spelt out in clause 15 includes\r\n\r\nprovision  for  the  competent authority to  require  connecting\r\n\r\nstructures to be provided and maintained.  This, I believe, will\r\n\r\nhave  an  impact  on improving accessibility  to  buildings  and\r\n\r\nincreasing  traffic  flow  which will  certainly  be  a  welcome\r\n\r\naddition  to  property developers and the public.   However,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I would like to seek assurance and clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister on a number of provisions  in  the  Planning\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 5, the competent authority is conferred with\r\n\r\nthe  functions instead of powers, as stated in the previous Act,\r\n\r\nto  carry out the provisions of this Bill.  I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister what this implies and what effect it would have  on\r\n\r\nthe development planning process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 14, in considering an application for written\r\n\r\npermission,  the competent authority must take into account  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Master Plan. However, as stated earlier, while\r\n\r\nthis gives certainty to applicants, subclause (2)(e) allows  the\r\n\r\ncompetent authority to disregard the Master Plan if he deems the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the  application to  be  incongruent  with  the\r\n\r\nadjoining  development. Sir, in my view, this  is  too  broad  a\r\n\r\nprovision  since the applicant may have submitted his  plans  in\r\n\r\ngood  faith  on  the latest Master Plan.  I seek the  Minister's\r\n\r\nassurance on this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 22(7), 29(4) and 39(7) state that there shall be\r\n\r\nno   judiciary  review  of  the  Minister's  decision.  This  is\r\n\r\nconsistent  with  the existing practice, but I  am  seeking  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  assurance that in protecting private  interest,  the\r\n\r\nrationale,  reasons  and basis for this decision  must  be  made\r\n\r\navailable to applicants, especially in view of the fact that the\r\n\r\ndecision  of the Minister cannot be challenged or questioned  in\r\n\r\nany court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37(2) imposes a liability of paying development\r\n\r\ncharges  on the property owner even if he has sold the  land  to\r\n\r\nanother party.  I seek the Minister's clarification on the legal\r\n\r\nimplication  of this matter and ask whether he would  reconsider\r\n\r\nthe  provision  to make the current land owner  responsible  for\r\n\r\npaying  development charge.  I am also appealing to the Minister\r\n\r\nto  retain  the  current practice of allowing the applicant  the\r\n\r\nchoice  of  opting  for  the  valuation  method  of  determining\r\n\r\ndevelopment  charges.   The alternative  method  of  development\r\n\r\ncharges  should  not be limited to the unknown term  \"prescribed\r\n\r\nsum\".   For  example,  it may occur that due  to  administrative\r\n\r\nlimitation and time lag, the development charge table may be out\r\n\r\nof line with the prevailing market conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, I find the amendments timely and\r\n\r\nappropriate.  I support the changes proposed but hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister will give due consideration and clarification  and  the\r\n\r\nassurances sought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

It is a well-known fact that real estate accounts for  a\r\n\r\nmajor  portion  of  assets  in  many  companies  and  for   many\r\n\r\nindividuals as well.  Hence, an Act as important as the Planning\r\n\r\nAct  carries with it the power to effect changes that will  have\r\n\r\nstrong   and   far-reaching  implications  on  the  population's\r\n\r\ndistribution of wealth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1998 Planning Bill effectively sums up the Planning Act\r\n\r\nof  1990 with some revisions.  With due regard, the current  Act\r\n\r\nand the subsequent amendments have served our nation well in all\r\n\r\naspects.  The steady transformation of Singapore's skyline  over\r\n\r\nthe years, I believe, is only one of the positive results of the\r\n\r\nsound  master  planning  by the competent  authority.   By  this\r\n\r\nvirtue,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I support this  Bill  in  principle.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  are several areas which I feel deserve  further\r\n\r\nstudy.   In putting forward these points, I hope to map out  the\r\n\r\nconcerns  that  this  Bill would have on  the  parties  directly\r\n\r\ninvolved in the real estate industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to comment on clause 15(1)(f). The\r\n\r\ncondition  for  granting approval gives the competent  authority\r\n\r\nenormous  power to take any amount of land out of a  development\r\n\r\nat  no cost.  It would definitely be more persuasive, and appear\r\n\r\nmore  reasonable, if it is stated more specifically in the  Bill\r\n\r\nthat  the  acquired  land is to be used  for  such  purposes  as\r\n\r\nsubstations,  road widening, open space for landed estates,  and\r\n\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor  the  acquisition of any land for public scheme or  purposes\r\n\r\nnot  related to development, the Land Acquisition Act should  be\r\n\r\nused, instead of this one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on clause 15(1)(g). This\r\n\r\nclause, which is already in existence in the current Act, states\r\n\r\nthat  not less than 30% of the floor area of any development  on\r\n\r\nthe  land  shall  remain in the ownership of one  person  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of 10 years.  At this point, I would like to declare  my\r\n\r\ninterest as the Deputy Chairman of the Property Committee of the\r\n\r\nChinese  Chamber  of  Commerce and Industry which  is  currently\r\n\r\ncarrying out a joint development of an office building downtown.\r\n\r\nLand in Singapore is getting scarce.  In order to achieve better\r\n\r\ndevelopment  potential, owners of different plots of  land  have\r\n\r\nthe  tendency to amalgamate and develop their land collectively.\r\n\r\nIf  a new company is formed to undertake this joint development,\r\n\r\nthen no technical difficulties will arise from the imposition of\r\n\r\nthe 30% condition.  However, there are cases in which the owners\r\n\r\nprefer  to  hold  the  amalgamated  land  as  tenants-in-common,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  forming  a  company.   Upon  completion  of   joint\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  subdivision would take place and titles  would  be\r\n\r\nissued  to  the  various  owners as  tenants-in-common.   By  an\r\n\r\ninstrument of partition, each owner would then receive his space\r\n\r\nentitlement  proportionate  to his original  land  contribution,\r\n\r\nsave  and  except that 30% of the floor area of the  development\r\n\r\nshall  remain  in  the names of the owners as tenants-in-common.\r\n\r\nUnder  this arrangement, many inconveniences will arise  because\r\n\r\nconsent  must  then  be  sought among all tenants-in-common  for\r\n\r\nmatters  such  as  mortgage and sale, and  this  is  not  easily\r\n\r\nachieved.   Hence,  I  would like to call  on  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider  modifying the condition to encourage joint development\r\n\r\nof small plots of land so as to allow larger scale comprehensive\r\n\r\ndevelopment of higher quality.  I am convinced that solutions to\r\n\r\nthis are readily available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to bring up is on clause\r\n\r\n18(2).   The Bill maintains that the competent authority  is  to\r\n\r\ngrant outline\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermission only after having considered matters relating to  the\r\n\r\nland  use,  intensity,  type, form and height  of  the  proposed\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  What I would like to highlight is the word \"form\".\r\n\r\nEssentially, the competent authority has the subjective power to\r\n\r\ndecide  whether  he  likes the design put up by  the  architect.\r\n\r\nWould   it  not  be  better  that  the  design  aspect  of   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  such  as form, be left in the good  hands  of  the\r\n\r\ndesign  architects?  In a free market economy, I doubt that  the\r\n\r\ndeveloper  or  design architects would be likely  to  put  up  a\r\n\r\ndesign which is not economically attractive.  By not restricting\r\n\r\nthe  form, we can then make headway in encouraging our designers\r\n\r\nto be more creative and innovative.  I believe this is something\r\n\r\nmost  of us would like to look forward to in the future  of  our\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made all these comments, Sir, I want to state the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the  Planning Bill 1998 has managed to  capture  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  the previous Planning Act.  To enhance its  intended\r\n\r\npurposes,  this new Bill contains several additional  provisions\r\n\r\nwhich  I believe would be welcomed by the members of the public.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  the  Bill now allows the competent  authority  to\r\n\r\ngrant  subdivision  permission at the  same  time  while  it  is\r\n\r\ngranting  planning or conservation permission.  This saves  time\r\n\r\nand energy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15(1)(h) gives the competent authority the powers to\r\n\r\nrequire  the  developers to design and construct buildings  with\r\n\r\nbetter  links  between them.  This requirement  would  not  only\r\n\r\nincrease public convenience but also allow for a better flow  of\r\n\r\npedestrian  traffic.  All these make good planning sense  and  I\r\n\r\nhave  no  doubt  that  the nation would  benefit  from  such  an\r\n\r\nintegrated approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not had very much\r\n\r\ntime  to  go through this Bill and to see what the changes  are,\r\n\r\nall  the  changes  to the previous Act.  But  listening  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  one of the major changes to this Act would appear  to\r\n\r\nbe  the  enhancement  of powers that are  to  be  given  to  the\r\n\r\nenforcement officers and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenhancement of punishments provided under the Act.  We were told\r\n\r\nthat the fine is being increased from $6,000 to $200,000.  It is\r\n\r\na  great  jump.  The  punishment would  appear  to  be  enhanced\r\n\r\ngreatly.   May  I plead, even if it be the lone  voice,  of  yet\r\n\r\nanother  instance, and this is increasingly the case, of denying\r\n\r\nthe  citizen  any review by an independent body of  any  of  the\r\n\r\npowers that are exercised by Government officers in the carrying\r\n\r\nout of their duties under the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I see that by clause 28(9) there shall be\r\n\r\nno  questioning of the validity of any enforcement notice except\r\n\r\nby  way of an appeal to the Minister.  The courts are not to  be\r\n\r\nappealed to by anyone aggrieved by an enforcement notice.   When\r\n\r\none  looks  at clause 29, one finds the provision  which,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  seems to have become the standard practice in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn  every  Act, one finds the decision of the Minister shall  be\r\n\r\nfinal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the powers, as I have said, have been\r\n\r\nenhanced and they are, in some cases, very drastic powers.   One\r\n\r\nMember  has  drawn  attention to clause 15 where  the  competent\r\n\r\nauthority  may  alienate any part of  the  land.   It  shall  be\r\n\r\ntransferred  free from encumbrances to the State or  any  public\r\n\r\nauthority,  as  he rightly pointed out.  That  is  a  very  wide\r\n\r\npower.  Should that not be restricted and should there not be an\r\n\r\nappeal if that power is abused for some reason or other?  Not an\r\n\r\nappeal to the Minister but an appeal to an independent body.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, should there not be some recourse for the person\r\n\r\nwho is aggrieved by the refusal to grant planning permission  or\r\n\r\nby  the  issue  of any enforcement notice to seek  a  review  by\r\n\r\nsomebody other than the Executive, and the Minister of course is\r\n\r\npart  of  the  Executive,  the  civil  servant  acts  under  the\r\n\r\nauthority  of the Minister.  Why is it not possible  for  us  to\r\n\r\nconsider  the setting up of an independent tribunal to entertain\r\n\r\nany appeals in such vital matters as this is where the citizen's\r\n\r\ninterest   may   be   affected  quite  drastically   and   quite\r\n\r\nextensively?  That would at least give the citizen  the  feeling\r\n\r\nthat his grievances will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsidered by an independent body who would listen carefully  to\r\n\r\nhis grievances and then decide them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it now stands, and I know from what is the usual\r\n\r\nprocedure  in  appeals  to the Ministers,  the  citizen  or  the\r\n\r\naggrieved person is not allowed any hearing before the Minister.\r\n\r\nHe  perhaps  can make a written representation.  I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  that  is allowed or whether all his objections  to  the\r\n\r\ncompetent  authority are just put before the Minister  who  then\r\n\r\ndecides  whether the competent authority was right or  not.   It\r\n\r\nwould  give  the citizen a greater sense of fairness or  feeling\r\n\r\nthat  his  complaints  will  be  considered  fairly  and  by  an\r\n\r\nindependent  body.  There is much to be said for not entrenching\r\n\r\nthe  Executive  with all the powers and making  them  the  final\r\n\r\njudges  of  whether  they are right or  wrong.   That  decision,\r\n\r\nwhether  they  are  right  or  wrong,  should  be  left  to   an\r\n\r\nindependent  tribunal.  I can see an argument  that  the  courts\r\n\r\nshould not be burdened with this.  But what is the objection  to\r\n\r\nsetting  up  a  tribunal?  This has happened in other  countries\r\n\r\nwhere  there  is a planning tribunal which hears representations\r\n\r\nfrom  people  who  are  affected by any  order  made  under  the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Act.   Why can Singapore not follow that  so  that  we\r\n\r\nintroduce a little bit of democracy into the functioning of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me thank Members for speaking up in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the Bill.  I think there are three key issues  that\r\n\r\nhave  been  addressed.   I would like to take  these  three  key\r\n\r\nissues.   One, how to strike a balance between having  a  Master\r\n\r\nPlan  that we follow religiously versus the flexibility to amend\r\n\r\nthe  Master  Plan.  The second key issue is how do we  have  the\r\n\r\npowers to vest land without it being abused.  Third, how to have\r\n\r\na  review  of  the Minister's decision, again to prevent  abuse.\r\n\r\nAnd then I will take the other issues raised by various Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue is the importance of the Master Plan to\r\n\r\nguide  long-term development of Singapore and to have  certainty\r\n\r\nin  that Master Plan so that everybody can make their individual\r\n\r\ndecisions through that Plan.  At the same time, we know that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  is very small and we have to respond to many  changes\r\n\r\nand we need some flexibility in that Plan.  What we have arrived\r\n\r\nat  after  many  years  of practice is to  have  a  Master  Plan\r\n\r\ncomprising  now of 55 Development Guide Plans.  We set  out  the\r\n\r\nplanning intentions of the different areas in Singapore.  Before\r\n\r\nthis  Development Guide Plan is gazetted, the draft Plan is  put\r\n\r\nout to the public for comment and if anybody is aggrieved by the\r\n\r\nproposals,  they can write in and they can object to  the  Plan.\r\n\r\nThe  Planning authority and the Ministry of National Development\r\n\r\nwill then look at each and every one of these objections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we are reviewing these plans every five\r\n\r\nyears but in between these five years, events may change and  we\r\n\r\nmay  need  to make amendments to these plans.  For example,  the\r\n\r\nproposed development of the Light Rail Transport will require  a\r\n\r\ncomplete change of the planning intentions in that area.  So  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  strike this balance between certainty of the Plan  and\r\n\r\nthe  flexibility to change.  So what we have provided for in the\r\n\r\nBill  is to set out the five limited circumstances in clause  14\r\n\r\nwhere consideration of public interest should be allowed to take\r\n\r\nprecedence  and  even where such circumstances  are  there,  the\r\n\r\ncompetent  authority  must  first obtain  the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  and the Ministry.  So the flexibility is  limited  and\r\n\r\nclearly  circumscribed and therefore we can be sure that  public\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the  Master Plan as a  reliable  guide  for  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of land in Singapore would not be undermined.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is the vesting of land. We could use the\r\n\r\nLand Acquisition Act for every piece of land that the Government\r\n\r\nneeds  for  public purposes.  But, again, through  practice,  we\r\n\r\nfind that as you develop a particular site, it is more efficient\r\n\r\nto vest that piece of land that is required for the public work,\r\n\r\nfor  example, to the Government and at the same time, you do not\r\n\r\nsuffer from any less development rights.  The development rights\r\n\r\nof  that  piece  of  land are transferred to  the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  That has, in practice, proven to be very effective\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  not  led to abuse.  In the old days, where developments  of\r\n\r\nlarge  tracts  of land are involved, vesting of lands  was  also\r\n\r\nrequired for setting up of parks and schools.  But that phase of\r\n\r\nSingapore's development is largely over.  Today, the vesting  of\r\n\r\nland  primarily refers to situations where you give up the  land\r\n\r\nin  front of your site for the widening of road, or you give  up\r\n\r\nthe  land  by  the side of your site for drainage reserves.   We\r\n\r\nhave  found  this  current practice of vesting  of  land  to  be\r\n\r\neffective,  efficient  and has not led  to  abuse  and  this  is\r\n\r\ncontinued in the present Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third main issue is whether there ought to be other\r\n\r\nmechanisms  of  review over the Ministry's  and  the  Minister's\r\n\r\ndecision.   Again,  over the years, we have set  up  a  practice\r\n\r\nwhere  any  change in the Master Plan is put out in  the  public\r\n\r\ndomain  and  anybody who is aggrieved can object to it  or  make\r\n\r\nrepresentations.  The Ministry treats the competent authority at\r\n\r\narm's  length.  Within the Ministry, the officials will evaluate\r\n\r\nthat  complaint  or  representation separately.   In  situations\r\n\r\nwhere  the  issue is very important, we will set up a  panel  of\r\n\r\nPlanning  Appeal Inspectors.  These are planners drawn from  the\r\n\r\nuniversity,  the private sector, or other statutory  board,  not\r\n\r\nwithin  the  Ministry of National Development.  We  should  then\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  planning  decision  of  the  competent  authority\r\n\r\nseparately and recommend to the Minister whether or not there is\r\n\r\na  case  for the appeal.  So there is established mechanism  for\r\n\r\nthis review.  We are not in favour of independent tribunals.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  want  to  refer every appeal to the court  because  the\r\n\r\nexperience  in  many  countries with such a  mechanism  is  that\r\n\r\nplanning  applications get bogged down and it takes a very  long\r\n\r\ntime  for any sensible development to take place.  It becomes  a\r\n\r\nmechanism by which different vested interests will use  that  to\r\n\r\nblock future developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now take the other issues raised by Members. Mr Rai\r\n\r\nasked  why not use the District Court instead of the High Court.\r\n\r\nI  must  confess  that I would have to be  guided  by  the  AG's\r\n\r\nChambers  on this.  My understanding is that the requirement  to\r\n\r\ngo to the High Court imposes a heavier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsibility   on   the  competent   authority.    Under   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  that we need to apply to the High  Court  for  an\r\n\r\ninjunction would be in situations where the owner excavates land\r\n\r\nand  we want to put a stop to it.  The AG's Chambers' advice  is\r\n\r\nthat the competent authority must approach the High Court rather\r\n\r\nthan  the District Court.  But I would take it up with the  AG's\r\n\r\nChambers and refer the two suggestions by Mr Rai to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai also suggested a subdivision of conservation units.\r\n\r\nToday, we do allow subdivision of shophouses in areas other than\r\n\r\nthe  conservation district.  In other words, in  shophouses  not\r\n\r\ngazetted  for  conservation, we do allow them to  be  subdivided\r\n\r\ninto  two units as long as they have separate access,  etc.   We\r\n\r\nare  a  little  bit  more cautious in the conservation  district\r\n\r\nbecause we want a single owner to make sure that there is proper\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and proper upkeep of the conserved  area.   But  we\r\n\r\nwould continue to monitor this.  If the subdivision in the other\r\n\r\nareas, other than the conservation district, does not lead to  a\r\n\r\ndegradation of the standards of conservation and maintenance, we\r\n\r\nwill be prepared to look at this issue again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli asked whether there is a difference between\r\n\r\n\"conferred\" and \"empowered\".  I think this is the new  language.\r\n\r\nI  was  told that in simplifying language, the clause says  that\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility and the functions conferred, rather than the\r\n\r\nold way of saying that we are empowered to do this and empowered\r\n\r\nto do that.  The substance remains the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the valuation method, we have found the standard\r\n\r\nvaluation  method to be effective.  We have done this  for  many\r\n\r\nyears.   We have been reviewing the standard development  charge\r\n\r\nevery  year.   We  have  found this to be  very  effective.   It\r\n\r\nprovides  greater certainty to the market.  We still retain  the\r\n\r\nprovision   to  allow  somebody  to  appeal  for  an  individual\r\n\r\nvaluation if he finds that the standard valuation does not quite\r\n\r\nmeet his requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional amendment in this Bill allows the Minister\r\n\r\nto set a certain limit below which one cannot ask for a separate\r\n\r\nvaluation.  This is for practical purposes where the development\r\n\r\ncharge  is  not  expected to be very much.  We  will  discourage\r\n\r\napplications  for separate valuations, because this  requires  a\r\n\r\nlot of time and resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang raised the issue of the 30% rule. Again, we\r\n\r\nfound  that  if  we  want  to  have  a  very  high  standard  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance,  particularly in shopping centres and strata  title\r\n\r\ndevelopments, it is necessary to have one owner having at  least\r\n\r\n30%,  so  that that owner can set the tone and the character  of\r\n\r\nthe  development.   If  the  entire  development  is  completely\r\n\r\nsubdivided, very soon you find the standard of maintenance  goes\r\n\r\ndown  and  that  there will be no leadership  in  redevelopment,\r\n\r\nmodifications or improvements.  So this 30% rule has  proven  to\r\n\r\nbe  quite  effective.   We will monitor  this.   Of  course,  it\r\n\r\nimposes certain burdens on the owner to retain the 30%.  It also\r\n\r\ncreates  problems where individual owners of small plots combine\r\n\r\nto  develop the entire property.  We will look at this  and  see\r\n\r\nhow  we  can  find a solution to overcome this - how to  achieve\r\n\r\nsingularity  of  purpose  that is given  when  you  have  a  30%\r\n\r\nownership,  like single owner versus the obstacles that  such  a\r\n\r\nrule creates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to assure Mr Chuang that it is not the\r\n\r\nintention  of  the  competent authority to  look  at  individual\r\n\r\ndesigns,  except  in critical areas.  We have  designated  areas\r\n\r\nwhere  the  buildings  will have to go before  an  architectural\r\n\r\ndesign  panel.  This is to ensure that the design is  compatible\r\n\r\nin  what  we  call \"designated routes\".  These  are  key  routes\r\n\r\nleading  to  the  Istana  or  what we designate  as  \"ceremonial\r\n\r\nroutes\".  Beyond these very restricted routes, it is not in  our\r\n\r\ninterest and we do not intend to regulate design.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talked about the enhancement of enforcement\r\n\r\npowers and fines.  I mentioned this in my speech.  Many of these\r\n\r\nenforcement  powers  have  to  be  increased  for  us   to   act\r\n\r\nexpeditiously on complaints.  A typical example will be  illegal\r\n\r\nuse of residence for workers'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquarters  or the illegal use of residence for place of  worship.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  present Act, the URA officers find it very difficult\r\n\r\nto  take enforcement action.  People congregate in a house to be\r\n\r\nused  as  a  temple over the weekend, at night  or  for  certain\r\n\r\nreligious  ceremonies.  It creates a big  nuisance.   Under  the\r\n\r\npresent  Act,  we do not have the powers to enter.  We  have  to\r\n\r\ncollect  a lot of evidence before we can take action.  And  when\r\n\r\nwe  do  take action, invariably there will be a long  series  of\r\n\r\nappeals  to  Members of Parliament, Ministers, etc.   Meanwhile,\r\n\r\nthe  people who live around the residence will have  to  put  up\r\n\r\nwith  it  being used as an illegal workers' quarters or  illegal\r\n\r\ntemple  for a long time.  So I think we want to strike a balance\r\n\r\nin  which we can take more effective action against such illegal\r\n\r\nuses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the enhancement of fines, again, as I have\r\n\r\nexplained,  it  is  the relativity between  the  fines  and  the\r\n\r\neconomic  value  of  continuing  with  the  illegal  use.   That\r\n\r\nrelativity  has  to  be  struck  again.   Otherwise,  they  just\r\n\r\ncontinue with the illegal use and pay the $50 fine per day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have clarified many of the very important points\r\n\r\nraised  by  Members  and I would like to thank  them  again  for\r\n\r\nsupporting the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a note.

There have been calls for greater\r\n\r\ntransparency and accountability in decisions taken in other\r\n\r\ncountries in their financial matters.  It is not altogether\r\n\r\nirrelevant to our problems in Singapore today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt the ever faithful press will report of the NCMP\r\n\r\nwasting  the  time and I see that every time they refer  to  me,\r\n\r\nthey  say the NCMP.  I am here not just as an NCMP.  I  am  also\r\n\r\nhere  as the leader of the Workers' Party, and I am speaking  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the party, not just for myself\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when we decided in the 1950s to set out on\r\n\r\nthe  road for self-government, we chose deliberately, of our own\r\n\r\nfree  choice,  the form and system of government that  we  would\r\n\r\nlike  for  Singapore.   And, of course, as Members are aware  or\r\n\r\nshould  be  aware, that an All-Party Mission went to London  for\r\n\r\ntalks  to hammer out what should be our style of government  and\r\n\r\nour  form of government, and included among them was none  other\r\n\r\nthan  the  one-time Secretary-General of the  ruling  party  and\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  for many years.  And we chose  the  Westminster\r\n\r\npattern  and  the  pattern that was followed in other  countries\r\n\r\nwhich had evolved into independence after British tutelage, that\r\n\r\nwe would have a division of powers.  We would have the Executive\r\n\r\nto  implement  and carry out the day-to-day decisions  that  are\r\n\r\nnecessary.  We would have the legislature, the Parliament,  that\r\n\r\nwould  make the laws for the people and circumscribe the  powers\r\n\r\nunder  which the Executive may act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, that we would\r\n\r\nhave  an independent Judiciary - this was clearly spelt  out  in\r\n\r\nthe  memorandum - the importance of an independent Judiciary who\r\n\r\nwill interpret the laws of the country and decide whether, be it\r\n\r\nthe  Executive or any citizen, has acted in accordance with  the\r\n\r\nlaw  or  laws  of the country.  So we had chosen  for  ourselves\r\n\r\nthese three divisions of Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following that choice by us, we finally enacted by Article\r\n\r\n93 of the Constitution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the judicial power shall be vested in the Supreme Court  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  such  other courts as may be  established.   Any\r\n\r\nlawyer   will   tell  you  that  judicial  power  includes   the\r\n\r\ninterpretation of any law passed by Parliament.  It is part  and\r\n\r\nparcel  of  their function - that the courts are  always  called\r\n\r\nupon  to  do  just  that, to interpret what the  law  means  and\r\n\r\nwhether anyone has acted outside the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good government, Mr Speaker, Sir, requires that government\r\n\r\nacts  in  accordance with the law.  Government is not above  the\r\n\r\nlaw.   No  one is above the law in a country which observes  the\r\n\r\nrule  of  law.   In  a  civilised  democratic  country,  if  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  acted  above the law or outside  the  law,  then  it\r\n\r\nceases to be a democratic government subject to the rule of  law\r\n\r\nand  it  becomes  no  better than a mafia government.   And  any\r\n\r\nissue,  whether the Government has acted under the law, must  be\r\n\r\ndetermined  by the Judiciary, not  by the Executive.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nthe  Executive becomes judge and jury, master in its own  cause,\r\n\r\ndecides what is the law and whether it has followed the  law  or\r\n\r\nnot.  That is not the case where the Rule of Law prevails and in\r\n\r\na  country  which professes to practise parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\nParliamentary  democracy, by its term, implies  that  Parliament\r\n\r\nshall  be  supreme and the Government shall act under  the  laws\r\n\r\npassed by Parliament and shall be accountable to Parliament, not\r\n\r\nact as a law unto itself.  These are absolutely necessary if  we\r\n\r\nare to have any transparency or accountability in our system  of\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  have, even our own Ministers, proclaiming  over\r\n\r\nand over again how transparent the Singapore Government is, that\r\n\r\nthey  accept the need for transparency, for all their  decisions\r\n\r\nto  be seen openly and to be judged by persons who are competent\r\n\r\nto judge such decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore a matter for regret, it is indeed sad, that\r\n\r\nover  the  last few years the Government has not been seen,  and\r\n\r\nmanifestly been seen, to have acted in accordance with the  law.\r\n\r\nThat, as I say, is vital in any democratic system of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first of all highlight the recent instance where the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not been seen and perceived to have acted  within\r\n\r\nthe  law.   I  should have also said that above  all  laws,  the\r\n\r\nConstitution is the supreme law and all other laws  are  subject\r\n\r\nto the Constitution.  Parliament is subject to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe  courts  are subject to the Constitution. The  Executive  is\r\n\r\nsubject to the Constitution.  It is the people's charter.  It is\r\n\r\nan Act of the people and it is through the Constitution that the\r\n\r\npeople  control the Government.  Therefore, it is a  matter  for\r\n\r\nregret  that  the Government should have been seen to  disregard\r\n\r\nflagrantly the provisions of the Constitution.  Of course, I  am\r\n\r\nreferring to the question which I raised in this House not  very\r\n\r\nlong  ago, whether the  Government had acted in accordance  with\r\n\r\nArticle  144 of the Constitution.  I do not wish to  read  again\r\n\r\nwhat  Article 144 of the Constitution says.  It is clear enough,\r\n\r\nand  it  seems  to us that before any loan is given Parliament's\r\n\r\nauthority  by  way of a resolution should be first obtained  and\r\n\r\nthat should again be ratified by the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say from the outset that this motion does not raise\r\n\r\nthe  question whether it was right or wrong to have offered this\r\n\r\nloan  to  Indonesia.  That is a matter which perhaps has  to  be\r\n\r\ndecided  at  some other time.  This motion raises  the  question\r\n\r\nwhether  the Government has been seen to act in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe  law.  May I also say quite clearly at the outset that I  am\r\n\r\nnot  here to argue that the Government's interpretation of  that\r\n\r\nArticle is wrong and that the interpretation that we seek to put\r\n\r\nis  the right one.  Parliament is not the forum to determine the\r\n\r\ninterpretation of any Article of the Constitution.  That,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  is  the  province  of the courts.   The  courts  have  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  it.    It  is  in  recognition  of  this   that   the\r\n\r\nConstitution  was  amended, I believe, in  1994,  to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nTribunal consisting of Supreme Court judges to whom any question\r\n\r\nconcerning  the effect of any provision of the Constitution  can\r\n\r\nbe referred to for an opinion.  So we have the machinery already\r\n\r\nset up.  Under Article 100A of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitution,  the  President may  refer  to  the  Tribunal  any\r\n\r\nquestion  concerning the interpretation of any  Article  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

As I was saying, we have a\r\n\r\nTribunal.  We know very little of the circumstances under  which\r\n\r\nthe  loan  came  to  be  granted or  agreed  to  be  granted  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   Indeed, when I raised the question  in  Parliament,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance was not quite clear even as  to  where\r\n\r\nthe decision was taken and it would appear that the decision was\r\n\r\nnot  really  taken by the Cabinet itself but was  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister in consultation with one or two other  Ministers\r\n\r\nand  later ratified by the Cabinet.  But, as I said, we are  not\r\n\r\nhere to inquire into all that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that we are here to consider is whether in so doing\r\n\r\nthe   Government   has  complied  with  Article   144   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  When my Party first raised this,  the answer from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister was, \"No, we have been advised that  it  does  not\r\n\r\napply  because way back in 1980 or 1986 the then Presidents  had\r\n\r\napproved  purchase of Indonesian equities or securities.\"   Then\r\n\r\nwhen  my Party took this matter up outside Parliament, in  press\r\n\r\nreleases,  we  heard from the Ministry of Law that  the  Article\r\n\r\nshould be interpreted in a particular way - I don't want  to  go\r\n\r\ninto  all that - and that we had got it grievously wrong in  our\r\n\r\ninterpretation.  So we offered immediately and said, \"All right.\r\n\r\nIf  you  say we have got it wrong, why not let the court  decide\r\n\r\nthis.\"  And as I said, there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  a  tribunal already in place which could have decided  this\r\n\r\nquestion  once and for all.  The answer came back, \"Oh  no!   We\r\n\r\ndon't   have  to  refer  it.   If  you  want,  you  refer   it.\"\r\n\r\nForgetting,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is only the President  who\r\n\r\nmay  refer these questions to the tribunal.  The Ministry of Law\r\n\r\nforgets this and says the Workers' Party can refer it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Party said, \"All right. If you want us to appear,\r\n\r\nwe  will be quite happy to appear, provided, in the event we are\r\n\r\nfound  to  have been wrong in our interpretation, no  costs  are\r\n\r\nlevied  against us.\"  It seems to be quite a reasonable request,\r\n\r\nmay I say, on a matter which concerns our taxpayers.  And it  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  trifling little sum that is in question.  It is  nothing\r\n\r\nless  than  S$8  billion.  And so we went on,  to  and  fro  and\r\n\r\nfinally the Party asked two questions: that the Ministry of  Law\r\n\r\nshould  answer  whether  it was the business  of  the  court  to\r\n\r\ninterpret or not and whether this was a matter of supreme public\r\n\r\nimportance.   We never got an answer to that.  And,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  silence is deafening.  The Ministry of Law could  not  very\r\n\r\nwell  come and say it is not for the court to interpret.  So  it\r\n\r\nis, I repeat, a matter for regret that on a matter like this, of\r\n\r\nsupreme  public importance, the taxpayers' monies of $8 billion,\r\n\r\nthe  Government is dragging its feet when it is suggested to  it\r\n\r\nthat  it  should get a decision from a competent tribunal  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to put this matter at rest.  All we can  say,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, it is to be deplored.  But this is not  the  only\r\n\r\ninstance,  although this is the most outstanding or  significant\r\n\r\ninstance and of very recent memory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the question whether the Prime Minister and the\r\n\r\ntwo  Deputy  Prime Ministers had broken the law on  polling  day\r\n\r\nwhen  they  entered the polling stations.  My Party had  made  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint that it was in clear violation of the section  in  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Elections Act.  It seems to us plain that the  Act\r\n\r\nprohibited  any person other than the candidate and his  polling\r\n\r\nagent  or election agent and, of course, other than the election\r\n\r\nofficials,  the  police and the voters, from entering  into  the\r\n\r\npolling  station.   That was made clear by section  39(4)  which\r\n\r\nsays: \"The presiding officer . shall exclude all other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersons\",  that  is,  persons  other  than  those  that  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned.   But  when  we complained  to  the  Police,  and  it\r\n\r\nappeared  to  us  that it was only the Police  that  could  take\r\n\r\naction  under  this, we were told that the Attorney-General  had\r\n\r\nruled that no offence had been committed because the section did\r\n\r\nnot mean what the Workers' Party was trying to say it meant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I wish to say, commenting on it, is that I was told, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that there was a story on the Internet.  I do  not\r\n\r\nsurf  the Internet, as they say these days.  The story was about\r\n\r\na  boy  who was caught by his mother coming out of a disco,  and\r\n\r\nthe  mother seized the boy and said, \"My son, didn't I tell  you\r\n\r\nthat  you  are not to go anywhere near a disco?\"   And  the  boy\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"But, mother, I was not anywhere near the disco.   I  was\r\n\r\ninside.   So how can you say I didn't follow what you told  me.\"\r\n\r\nThat  is the only comment that I wish to make.  It seems  to  us\r\n\r\nplain  that the Act prevented or prohibited persons, other  than\r\n\r\nthose  I  have mentioned, from being present inside the  polling\r\n\r\nstation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was yet another matter on which the Government\r\n\r\nseems reluctant.  And this was the question that I posed to  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  on the sitting on 19th November  and  emerged\r\n\r\nfrom  it.   I had asked the question whether section  8  of  the\r\n\r\nPrevention of Corruption Act was considered by him when  he  was\r\n\r\nasked  by  the  Prime Minister to inquire into the purchases  at\r\n\r\nNassim  Jade and Scotts 28 by the Senior Minister and  DPM  Lee.\r\n\r\nThe  answer given seemed to me to confirm that section 8 of  the\r\n\r\nPrevention  of  Corruption Act was never  considered.   And  his\r\n\r\nanswer was that it was not considered because nobody thought  it\r\n\r\nhad  any  application to the purchases.  But section  8  of  the\r\n\r\nPrevention of Corruption Act is again explicit and it says, if I\r\n\r\nmay read it, Mr Speaker, Sir:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Where in any proceedings against a person for an offence\r\n\r\nunder  section  5 or 6, it is proved that any gratification  has\r\n\r\nbeen  paid or given to or received by a person in the employment\r\n\r\nof  the Government or any department thereof or of a public body\r\n\r\nby  or  from a person or agent of a person who has or  seeks  to\r\n\r\nhave  any dealing with the Government or any department  thereof\r\n\r\nor  any public body, that gratification shall be deemed to  have\r\n\r\nbeen  paid  or given and received corruptly as an inducement  or\r\n\r\nreward as hereinbefore mentioned unless the contrary is proved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So under the Prevention of Corruption Act, the decision is\r\n\r\nleft  to the court to determine so long as it is found that  the\r\n\r\nrecipient  is a public official and the gratification  has  been\r\n\r\nreceived or agreed to be received from a body which has or would\r\n\r\nhave  dealings with the Government.  And there was  no  question\r\n\r\nthat  the developer would have had dealings with the Government.\r\n\r\nAnd if one looks at the definition of gratification, it seems to\r\n\r\nus  to  be  plain  that the giving of the discount  was  covered\r\n\r\nwithin the meaning of the word \"gratification\".  So, again,  the\r\n\r\ncourts were not given an opportunity to pronounce on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going further back, and this was of course in 1988 and it\r\n\r\nconcerns   me,   the  Government  ignored  a  pronouncement   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's highest court.  Government wastes no time in  paying\r\n\r\nlip service to respecting the courts and does not waste any time\r\n\r\nto  punish anyone who it says is in contempt of the court.   And\r\n\r\nyet  when Singapore's highest court, as it was in 1988,  made  a\r\n\r\npronouncement that the convictions were wrong and that there had\r\n\r\nbeen  a  serious miscarriage of justice, how did the  Government\r\n\r\nreact  to  a  pronouncement by its own court?   Let  it  not  be\r\n\r\nforgotten  that  the Privy Council, although it was  staffed  by\r\n\r\nBritishers,  was  Singapore's court  set  up  by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment to hear appeals and it was praised as serving a  very\r\n\r\nuseful  task.   And the reason given was that the Privy  Council\r\n\r\nhad no jurisdiction.  The Privy Council itself admitted that  it\r\n\r\nhad  no  jurisdiction to set aside the conviction.  We  did  not\r\n\r\nneed the Government to tell us because the convictions were  not\r\n\r\nbefore  the Council.  But the Privy Council had the jurisdiction\r\n\r\n-  and this was not only a decision of the Privy Council, it was\r\n\r\nalso  the decision of the High Court of Singapore - that it  had\r\n\r\njurisdiction  to consider the validity of the convictions  in  a\r\n\r\nrelated  appeal.  Having looked at the convictions and how  they\r\n\r\nwere obtained, they said that there was a serious miscarriage of\r\n\r\njustice.   And the Government not only ignored the pronouncement\r\n\r\nbut committed contempt of court, despite the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  Prime  Minister, now Senior Minister,  saying  before  the\r\n\r\nCommittee of Privileges in 1986 that if it was shown that  there\r\n\r\nwas   any  injustice,  Parliament  should  ask  immediately  the\r\n\r\nPresident to set aside the convictions or to order a new  trial.\r\n\r\nThat apparently meant nothing.  And then the Prime Minister when\r\n\r\nhe  went to Williams College committed blatant contempt  of  the\r\n\r\nJudiciary by saying they were playing politics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have selected these four instances\r\n\r\nbecause  they  seem to me to be very glaring.  There  are  other\r\n\r\ninstances  where the Government and officers have not been  seen\r\n\r\nand  perceived to be acting within the law.  It is my submission\r\n\r\nthat,  by  so  doing, the Government loses its credibility.   It\r\n\r\nloses  its moral authority to govern Singapore if it refuses  to\r\n\r\nabide  by  the Constitution which is the supreme law  and  which\r\n\r\nbinds  the  Government, Parliament and even the Judiciary.   Any\r\n\r\ngovernment  which  is  sensitive to its  role  as  a  democratic\r\n\r\ngovernment and observing the rule of law would only be too ready\r\n\r\nto   submit   its  decisions  for  examination  by  a  competent\r\n\r\nauthority,  competent  to examine its  decisions  and  make  any\r\n\r\npronouncement  on  it.  But apparently, this Government  is  not\r\n\r\nprepared to do so.  The Government behaves, as I said, as though\r\n\r\nit  is a law unto itself.  No one is right except itself.  That,\r\n\r\nmay  I  say, Mr Speaker, Sir, is a very arrogant attitude to  be\r\n\r\ntaken by any government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is my plea in this House - let us forget about the\r\n\r\nother instances - that this question of granting the loan of S$8\r\n\r\nbillion  or  agreeing to grant the loan was taken in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the Constitution be referred immediately to this tribunal.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot do it, as I said.  The Workers' Party cannot  do  it.\r\n\r\nNo  member  of  the  public can do it.  The President,  and  the\r\n\r\nPresident  of  course  acts, as he  is  required  to  under  the\r\n\r\nConstitution, on the advice of the Government.   So  I  do  hope\r\n\r\nthat the Government will reconsider its reluctance and have this\r\n\r\nmatter  now referred to the tribunal under Article 100A  and  if\r\n\r\nthe  tribunal  wishes  to hear arguments, we,  in  the  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty,  will  be quite happy to appear before the  tribunal  and\r\n\r\npresent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  we think is the contrary argument.  But it is the tribunal\r\n\r\nwhich  has to decide that, not the Government.  And my  plea  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government should do that now.  It will  then  redeem\r\n\r\nitself  in  the eyes of the public.  It will show  itself  as  a\r\n\r\nGovernment that is sensitive to public opinion, that  heeds  the\r\n\r\nnecessity to abide by the Constitution and the Rule of Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.22 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nParliament, the Executive and the Judiciary are the three  major\r\n\r\npillars  of  Singapore's  Government.  Apart  from  legislation,\r\n\r\nParliament  has   the  supervisory power over  the  Government's\r\n\r\naction.   The Government should ensure that all its actions  are\r\n\r\ncarried  out  in  accordance with the  law.   The  Judiciary  is\r\n\r\nresponsible for interpreting the laws passed by  Parliament  and\r\n\r\nto  find out whether the acts of the Government are carried  out\r\n\r\nin accordance with the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Government offered to loan US$5 billion to\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  Whether or not this is done in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nlaw   should  not  be  left  to  the Attorney-General  alone  to\r\n\r\ninterpret  in  such  a  way that justifies  the  action  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  This  is  not convincing, and  it  is  against  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of the separation of powers between the Executive, the\r\n\r\nLegislature and the Judiciary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 144 of the Constitution provides for the protection\r\n\r\nof   the  assets  of  the  people.   The  Attorney  General  has\r\n\r\ninterpreted  this Article in such a way that it cannot  restrain\r\n\r\nthe  Government  from  making such a  substantial  loan  without\r\n\r\nhaving first obtained the approval of the Elected President.  If\r\n\r\nthe Government can freely make use of the reserves to lend money\r\n\r\nto  any organisation or any foreign government, then the Elected\r\n\r\nPresident  who  is supposed to be responsible  for  holding  the\r\n\r\nsecond  key,  is  quite  useless.  Is this  a  loophole  in  our\r\n\r\nConstitution?   Therefore, to refer the  interpretation  of  the\r\n\r\nArticle to the tribunal set up under the Constitution is what  a\r\n\r\nresponsible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngovernment  should do.  But, unfortunately and regrettably,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Law  is trying to push the responsibility  to  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party.  This is not a question between the  Government\r\n\r\nand the Workers' Party.  It is a question whether the Government\r\n\r\nis  acting according to the law, respecting the Constitution and\r\n\r\nbe responsible to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the people of Singapore are questioning the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  right  to grant a huge loan   to  another  country\r\n\r\nwithout  the  President's  approval.    The  Government   should\r\n\r\ntherefore refer the matter to the tribunal in order to   enhance\r\n\r\nthe  confidence of the people in the Government.  Why should the\r\n\r\nGovernment shirk the responsibility?  Therefore, I would  appeal\r\n\r\nto  the Government to refer the interpretation of Article 144 to\r\n\r\nthe  Constitutional  tribunal to show that  the  Government  has\r\n\r\nindeed  the respect for the Judiciary and for such a respect  to\r\n\r\nbe affirmed. .\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, both Mr Jeyaretnam and Mr\r\n\r\nLow  have  talked  about the recent episode  of  the  loan  that\r\n\r\nGovernment  made to Indonesia.  Mr Jeyaretnam made other  points\r\n\r\nwhich  I will address briefly afterwards because they are points\r\n\r\nthat  have been addressed before.  Other than the loan,  he  has\r\n\r\nreally  brought  up  old  issues.  But this  current  one  is  a\r\n\r\ncontinuation  of  the debate that began in this  House  on  19th\r\n\r\nNovember  1997 when Mr Jeyaretnam asked the question of  Dr  Hu,\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, as to the constitutionality of the  loan.\r\n\r\nHe  said that the Workers' Party questions its constitutionality\r\n\r\nand he said that the Government should be the party to refer the\r\n\r\nmatter  to  the constitutional court.  Let me first of  all  put\r\n\r\nthings  in  context, set out the backdrop to  this  episode,  in\r\n\r\nparticular the exchange of letters between the Government and Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, it began on 19th November 1997 in this House,\r\n\r\nafter  which  in  a  letter dated 20th November,  Mr  Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nrepeated  his  allegation  of  unconstitutionality  in  a  press\r\n\r\nrelease.   The  Government responded very quickly the  following\r\n\r\nday\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  explain carefully the operation of Article 144, setting  out\r\n\r\nthe Attorney-General's opinion.  Obviously, Mr Jeyaretnam either\r\n\r\ndid  not  want  to or could not grasp the explanation  that  was\r\n\r\ngiven.   Calling  the law \"an ass\", he asked the  Government  to\r\n\r\nrefer  the  matter to a constitutional court, boasting  that  he\r\n\r\nwould argue the case himself.  The Government responded that the\r\n\r\nlaw  was clear and that there was no need to do so.  But  if  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam wished to, he was free to bring the matter before the\r\n\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True to character, Mr Jeyaretnam shifted ground. He did\r\n\r\nnot  say it as much just now but he alluded to it.  But  let  me\r\n\r\nput  it in the fullest context.  He said that the Workers' Party\r\n\r\nwould  bring  the matter before our courts but on the  condition\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government agreed to bear all legal  costs.   So  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party  would bring the matter to  the  court  but  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  with  taxpayers'  money,  bears  the  legal  costs,\r\n\r\nincluding  those  for  engaging  a  constitutional  lawyer  from\r\n\r\noverseas.   If  that  was not already an absurd  condition,  yet\r\n\r\nanother condition was that the Government should meet AG's costs\r\n\r\nin  defending the suit even if it failed.  So the Workers' Party\r\n\r\nbrings  the suit.  First, he said he would argue himself.   Then\r\n\r\nhe  said,  \"Well,  we will bring the suit.   We  will  bring  an\r\n\r\noverseas lawyer, expert constitutional lawyer.  But if we  fail,\r\n\r\nwe  won't  bear  AG's costs.\"  At that stage, Mr Jeyaretnam  was\r\n\r\nalready talking of the action failing and no longer was he going\r\n\r\nto  argue the case himself.  He was now going to get an overseas\r\n\r\nconstitutional lawyer.  Obviously, he had second thoughts  about\r\n\r\nhis  assertion  that  Article  144  was  unconstitutional.   And\r\n\r\nindeed, I think it was a wise thing when he said he would  bring\r\n\r\nan  overseas constitutional lawyer to help him because, if I may\r\n\r\nsay, he needs it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these absurd conditions, the Government responded the\r\n\r\nnext day that the Workers' Party's position was ludicrous.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment also reiterated its position that, as advised by  the\r\n\r\nAG, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaw  was clear.  There was therefore no need to refer the matter\r\n\r\nto  the  courts.  And we also said that if Mr Jeyaretnam claimed\r\n\r\notherwise, he was free to do so.  So we have this as the current\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal position, as confirmed by the AG, is clear. What\r\n\r\nthe  Government has done is within the law and the Constitution.\r\n\r\nBut  Mr  Jeyaretnam disagrees.  Just because  he  disagrees,  he\r\n\r\nwants  the  Government to refer the matter to the  courts.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has said no.  From that, he now wants this  House  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  the Executive does not respect the Judiciary  as  the\r\n\r\nfinal  arbiter  of our laws.  So it is a quantum  jump.   It  is\r\n\r\npreposterous  that  just because he, as  an  Opposition  Member,\r\n\r\nmakes an issue of it or demands it, we are obliged to refer  the\r\n\r\nmatter  to  the  courts.  How does this follow?   Mr  Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nhaving  failed to be elected in the last general election  wants\r\n\r\npublicity.  But the courts are not there to satisfy his  craving\r\n\r\nfor  publicity.  If Mr Jeyaretnam is sincere and serious in  his\r\n\r\nview  that  the  Government has breached the Constitution,  then\r\n\r\nsurely as a lawyer he knows that he can initiate action  in  our\r\n\r\ncourts to challenge the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam clearly does not understand the provisions of\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution.   So what I have done is  I  have  asked  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General to once again elaborate on its earlier  opinion\r\n\r\nas  to  why  Article  144  does  not  apply  to  loans  made  by\r\n\r\nGovernment,  applying  rather to loans made  to  Government,  in\r\n\r\nother words, when the Government borrows money, not lends money.\r\n\r\nThis  is  for Mr Jeyaretnam's elucidation.  I will now  ask  the\r\n\r\nClerk to distribute AG's elaboration (Cols. 133-6).  [Copies  of\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's elaboration distributed to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980114/19980114-HA-0680133.htm\">AG's elaboration (Cols. 133 - 136)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AG's exposition of these provisions on reserves is very\r\n\r\nclear.   Article  144  applies  to situations  where  Government\r\n\r\nborrows    ,  not lends, money.  This is because when Government\r\n\r\nborrows  money,  it borrows on public credit.  So  a  profligate\r\n\r\ngovernment  without  enough money in the coffers  to  spend  can\r\n\r\nborrow money, but who will return the money?  Future governments\r\n\r\nwill have to do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam would do well to take some time to read it\r\n\r\ncarefully.   Or  better  still, he should consult  his  overseas\r\n\r\nconstitutional lawyer.  He would then discover that  if  anybody\r\n\r\nis  an ass, it is not the law.  AG has set out the position very\r\n\r\nclearly   and   I   hope  he  reads  it  very  carefully.    His\r\n\r\ninterpretation is backed by common sense.  In fact, paragraph  8\r\n\r\nof AG's note puts it very nicely.  Let me read the paragraph:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If Mr J B Jeyaretnam's view of Article 144 is correct, it\r\n\r\nmeans that the Government's power to give any loan of any amount\r\n\r\nto  any  person anywhere is now restricted by Article  144.   It\r\n\r\nmeans,  for example, that the Government may not give car  loans\r\n\r\nor  computer  loans to civil servants without  the  sanction  of\r\n\r\nParliament  and  the  President.   That  would  be  an  absurdly\r\n\r\nimpractical way for the Government to govern.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Jeyaretnam prefaced his speech by saying that he makes a very\r\n\r\npractical point.  It is not an academic point, not a moot point.\r\n\r\nBut  the  interpretation he argues for would, in fact,  lead  to\r\n\r\nmuch impracticality in governance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AG's elaboration is also backed by other premises or basis\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  rules of statutory interpretation,  reference  to\r\n\r\nArticle  144(2)  and  also to the concept  of  reddendo  singula\r\n\r\nsingulis  and  indeed even to the reference to  the  legislative\r\n\r\nmaterial,  eg, the White Paper, where in paragraph 42  on  which\r\n\r\nArticle  144  is based, it is stated very clearly,  Article  144\r\n\r\ntalks  about situations where Government raises loans, not gives\r\n\r\nloans, as well as other provisions in the Constitution and  also\r\n\r\nother  legislation.  This is a full opinion.  I  hope  he  takes\r\n\r\ncare to read it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's constitutional powers to safeguard reserves\r\n\r\nare therefore not compromised in any way.  And the Government is\r\n\r\nvery  open about it.  That is transparent government.   We  will\r\n\r\ntell  you  why  we  think the law is clear.   And  because  AG's\r\n\r\nexposition  is clear, the law is clear, Government  accepts  it.\r\n\r\nOf  course, again, as I said, if Mr Jeyaretnam thinks otherwise,\r\n\r\nhe is free to bring the matter to the courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to another absurd point made by Mr Jeyaretnam - that the AG is a member of the Executive, hence it is really a\r\n\r\ncase of the Executive interpreting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaws  passed by Parliament.  I think that is what he has alluded\r\n\r\nto.   He  talks about the two questions he raised  in  his  last\r\n\r\nletter  where  there is really no need to reply to  because  the\r\n\r\nexchange  had  gone on for sometime already, and Government  had\r\n\r\nput  its  case very clearly.  This is one question that  he  had\r\n\r\nasked  - is AG a member of the Executive?  Government says  AG's\r\n\r\nopinion  is clear, therefore, there is no need to refer  to  the\r\n\r\ncourts.   I think such an assertion really shows Mr Jeyaretnam's\r\n\r\ngross  misunderstanding of the role of the  AG  as  chief  legal\r\n\r\nadviser  to  the  Government, as set out in Article  35  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As chief legal adviser, AG is asked, from time to time, to\r\n\r\nadvise  the  Government  on the legality of  proposed  executive\r\n\r\ndecisions  or  actions.   His  role  is  to  give  legal  advice\r\n\r\nobjectively.  In giving such advice, the AG may have  to  advise\r\n\r\nthe  Government  on the interpretation of the  provisions  of  a\r\n\r\nstatute.  In this case, he had to interpret Article 144  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.    His  advice,  like  any  other  legal   adviser\r\n\r\nincluding Mr Jeyaretnam who himself is a lawyer, represents  his\r\n\r\nown  understanding  of the law.  He does  not  have  to  seek  a\r\n\r\njudicial ruling before tendering advice to the Government.  Like\r\n\r\nall  legal advisers, AG will assess each case on its own merits.\r\n\r\nLike  all legal advisers, he will not say that there is a strong\r\n\r\ncase if there is really none.  After all, he has to stand by his\r\n\r\nopinion to the Cabinet, and if it becomes public as it has  now,\r\n\r\nthen  to Singaporeans and indeed to others in the world who  may\r\n\r\ncare  to  read it, examine it, especially to his own fellow  AGs\r\n\r\nfrom other jurisdictions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance, AG has advised that the US$5 billion loan\r\n\r\nto  Indonesia  is lawful.  The Government has no reason  not  to\r\n\r\naccept  AG's  advice.   In  so  doing,  we  can  understand   Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam's  disappointment in that he will not  have  what  he\r\n\r\nwants  - Government acting on his prompting to bring the  matter\r\n\r\nto  the  constitutional court.  But for him to claim  that  non-referral   of  AG's  legal  interpretation  to  the  courts   is\r\n\r\ntantamount  to  not  respecting the  courts,  I  think  that  is\r\n\r\nmischievous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two instances that Mr Jeyaretnam mentioned just\r\n\r\nnow ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Three.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> All right. Two instances as\r\n\r\nregards AG's role as Public Prosecutor, which is also set out in\r\n\r\nArticle  35.  We all know that the AG has got the discretion  to\r\n\r\nprosecute  or  not  to prosecute, and he will  do  that  fairly,\r\n\r\nimpartially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this point about PAP leaders not being prosecuted for\r\n\r\nacts  done in connection with the last General Election,  again,\r\n\r\nthis has been fully debated in this House when the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLaw  answered and gave a full reply.  He also set out an opinion\r\n\r\nby  the  AG  which again was made public.  So it is examined  by\r\n\r\neverybody  why  the provisions do not apply.  The same  argument\r\n\r\napplies  to  the Prevention of Corruption Act.  Is it  relevant?\r\n\r\nIs  it applicable?  The AG will have to decide, and he does this\r\n\r\nacting  in his constitutional role of Public Prosecutor,  acting\r\n\r\nfairly and impartially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go on to the other point, Mr Low Thia Khiang\r\n\r\ntalked  about  a  loophole in the Constitution - can  Government\r\n\r\njust  lend  money?  The Government has the power to lend  money,\r\n\r\nbut,  ultimately, I think he will agree that all of us know that\r\n\r\nthe  Government's actions are accountable to the people.  So  if\r\n\r\nwe  make  imprudent loans and we cannot defend what  we  do,  we\r\n\r\nanswer  for  it in the next general election.  So  there  is  an\r\n\r\nelement of accountability.  And if you look at AG's opinion,  he\r\n\r\nalso mentioned Article 148G where the Accountant-General and the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General  have  the duty to advise the  President  should\r\n\r\nthere  be  transactions or proposed transactions which to  their\r\n\r\nknowledge  are  likely to draw on the reserves.   So  there  are\r\n\r\nchecks and balances, I would like to assure Mr Low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the question arises: is Mr Jeyaretnam therefore\r\n\r\nhypocritical  in  moving this motion?  I  ask  this  because  he\r\n\r\naccuses the Government of not respecting the Judiciary.  But let\r\n\r\nme ask him: has he once stood up for the Judiciary?  On the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrary,  the Member was censured by this House in  1987  which\r\n\r\nfound him guilty of abuse of the privileges of Parliament in his\r\n\r\nallegation  of Executive interference in the Judiciary.   So  he\r\n\r\nhimself  impugned the integrity of the Judiciary and  Parliament\r\n\r\npunished  him with a maximum fine of $1,000.  I should say  that\r\n\r\nhe is the least qualified to talk of respect for the Judiciary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the position of the Executive, and indeed of this\r\n\r\nHouse, has always been that our Judiciary should be accorded due\r\n\r\nrespect and its integrity defended.  This is on record.   It  is\r\n\r\nvery  clear from Government's actions.  We stand by the rule  of\r\n\r\nlaw.   We  subscribe  to  the  separation  of  powers  and   the\r\n\r\nindependence of our Judiciary.  Indeed, if Mr Low can remember - Mr  Jeyaretnam  was not here at that time - it was  only  a  few\r\n\r\nyears  ago in November 1995 that the Government on that occasion\r\n\r\nstoutly   defended  the  integrity  and  independence   of   our\r\n\r\nJudiciary.   On  that  occasion,  this  House  passed  a  motion\r\n\r\ndenouncing the SDP for attacking the Judiciary.  The message was\r\n\r\nclear.   The  greatest respect should be shown  to  our  Judges.\r\n\r\nEven  Mr Chiam See Tong - he is not here today - I think all  of\r\n\r\nus remember that episode, he was then still an SDP member, stood\r\n\r\nup  for a principle and defended our Judiciary, even if it meant\r\n\r\ndisassociating himself from the then leadership of the SDP.   He\r\n\r\nvoted in favour of the motion.  The Workers' Party, on the other\r\n\r\nhand,  issued a statement that it would not participate  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate  and  its  sole  representative in  the  House,  Mr  Low,\r\n\r\nabstained in the voting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, therefore, I would urge this House to soundly reject\r\n\r\nthis  motion.   It  is  baseless.  It  is  mischievous.   It  is\r\n\r\nhypocritical.   Before I conclude, I think  Mr  Jeyaretnam  will\r\n\r\nremind  me of one more example he cited, his own case  in  1987.\r\n\r\nHere again, the grounds have been fully ventilated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> 1988, not 1987.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Thank you. The grounds have\r\n\r\nbeen  fully ventilated.  Indeed, this was debated in this  House\r\n\r\nin  January 1989, when the Minister for Law answered a  question\r\n\r\nraised by Dr Lee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSiew  Choh  on  this matter.  So it was fully  ventilated.   The\r\n\r\ngrounds  are  very  clear.  In fact, the Privy  Council,  as  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  said  himself,  had  no  jurisdiction  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ncommenting on the criminal convictions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You got me completely wrong. I will reply\r\n\r\nto you.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> All right. It is very clear.\r\n\r\nThe  grounds are there.  The matter before the Privy Council  in\r\n\r\nthat  case  was  disbarment, not the criminal  convictions.   So\r\n\r\nwhatever comments the Privy Council made on the convictions were\r\n\r\nnot  binding, and the Privy Council, in fact, said that.   Also,\r\n\r\nbecause the Public Prosecutor was not present, important  points\r\n\r\nof  law  were  not argued.  These are just examples.   The  main\r\n\r\npoint  that  Mr  Jeyaretnam wants us to look at  is  really  the\r\n\r\nmotion.   I  do  not  think we should be side-tracked  by  these\r\n\r\nexamples which I have said are old examples.  He would  like  us\r\n\r\nto  re-visit these issues, but they are really all in the books.\r\n\r\nGovernment  stands  by what it has said in  the  past  which  is\r\n\r\ntotally defensible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, once again, I urge this House to reject the\r\n\r\nmotion.  Let me conclude by affirming that the job of government\r\n\r\nis to govern.  And we will govern effectively so as to safeguard\r\n\r\nour  interests domestically, in foreign relations  and  defence,\r\n\r\nand  we  will  do this in a manner and in the best  interest  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  in  accordance with the law.   If  it  requires\r\n\r\ngetting the President's approval or coming to Parliament to pass\r\n\r\nlaws  or  debate  policies, we will do it.  But if  it  requires\r\n\r\ndecisive Executive action, as was the case for the loan  because\r\n\r\ntiming  was a consideration, then we will continue to take  such\r\n\r\ndecisive actions.  [Applause].\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, it\r\n\r\nis  not  apparent to me what specifically Mr Jeyaretnam  had  in\r\n\r\nmind  when  he moved this motion.  Allow me therefore  to  begin\r\n\r\nwith some general observations on the motion before dealing with\r\n\r\nthe specifics of what I have just heard him and the Minister  of\r\n\r\nState for Law, Assoc. Prof. Ho, say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is apparent to all of us that Singapore has a\r\n\r\nwritten Constitution that sets out the respective roles of three\r\n\r\nmain and equal institutions - Parliament, the Executive and  the\r\n\r\nJudiciary.   It  is also very clear that the Constitution  gives\r\n\r\njudicial  power to the Judges.  \"Judicial power\", what  does  it\r\n\r\nmean?  I tend to agree with the NCMP that it is to interpret the\r\n\r\nlaw.   But  then,  I  think, in principle,  any  first-year  law\r\n\r\nstudent  would agree with the same.  The question then  becomes:\r\n\r\nin practice, has this Executive government observed that rule of\r\n\r\nlaw?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegation, first, must be taken seriously. Because,\r\n\r\nif  it is true, then there are very serious consequences.   Many\r\n\r\nstates  in history have let slip the rule of law and there  have\r\n\r\nbeen tales in which judges, after giving a decision against  the\r\n\r\nExecutive, had found themselves removed or, worse, confronted by\r\n\r\narmed  men and tanks.  I am glad to know that we have a  trained\r\n\r\ndefence  force  in  Singapore  and  mobilisation  exercises.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  none of us, including the NCMP, would want to see  that\r\n\r\nkind  of  mobilisation exercise carried out.  So it is a serious\r\n\r\nmatter and political, social and economic consequences would  be\r\n\r\nvery  high  for  Singapore.  What then must be done,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  to  prevent the possibility of force overwhelming  the\r\n\r\nrule  of law or subtler means in which the rule of the Judiciary\r\n\r\nmight be usurped?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that has not been said in Parliament today is\r\n\r\nthat  our  Constitution provides that the Judges of our  Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt  have  security  of tenure in office.   With  very  narrow\r\n\r\nexceptions  such  as unsoundness of mind, body or  misbehaviour,\r\n\r\nthe  Judges  of our Supreme Court cannot be summarily  dismissed\r\n\r\nnor can their salaries or powers be reduced.  This is important.\r\n\r\nThis  is an important protection against improper influence  and\r\n\r\nfear from the Executive or from others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts also have the powers to punish people who speak or\r\n\r\nact  in  contempt of court.  And so in this way,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nsystem gives Judges as much protection as the law can give.   Is\r\n\r\nthere more that can be done?  Sir,  I wish to speak\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  one general principle that I wish to introduce to this House\r\n\r\nbefore turning to specifics that Mr Jeyaretnam has raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step, I believe, to make the situation even\r\n\r\nbetter is that all Singaporeans must recognise and respect  that\r\n\r\nthe  Judiciary can, and often will, review and strike down  laws\r\n\r\npassed  by  this  House or actions taken by the  Executive.   In\r\n\r\nSingapore's legal history, though brief, there have  been  cases\r\n\r\nin  which  the court has disagreed with Government agencies  and\r\n\r\nstatutory  bodies such as the Housing and Development Board  and\r\n\r\nthe  Registry  of  Companies.  These are  not  small  and  petty\r\n\r\nbureaucracies.  These were serious decisions taken by the  court\r\n\r\nin favour of individual Singaporeans against powerful Government\r\n\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this past year itself, we have seen the courts\r\n\r\nsignificantly reduce the amount of damages sought by  Government\r\n\r\nleaders  in  their personal capacities against  their  political\r\n\r\nopponents  for defamation.  In two major cases, the courts  have\r\n\r\nruled  against the Executive.  First, in the decision  of  PP  v\r\n\r\nBridges,  the  courts held that the courts should be  the  final\r\n\r\narbiter  of  what is or what is not a secret under the  Official\r\n\r\nSecrets  Act,  not  the  Executive.    Second,  and  even   more\r\n\r\nrecently,  in  the case of former GIC manager,  Eddie  Taw,  the\r\n\r\ncourt refused to uphold his conviction on charges of corruption.\r\n\r\nAccording to newspaper reports, the Judge held that part of  the\r\n\r\nPrevention of Corruption Act is unconstitutional insofar  as  it\r\n\r\nprovides  an  unequal burden on Singaporeans.  I am not  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  the  substance of these cases, but I think  the  principle\r\n\r\nmust  be  clear to everyone that our courts are independent  and\r\n\r\nthese  examples  that  I illustrate are  not  to  shore  up  our\r\n\r\nbureaucracy  or Executive but to show that, when necessary,  our\r\n\r\ncourts are strong and bold enough to put right what they see  as\r\n\r\nwrong.   I  think the Executive has demonstrated in these  cases\r\n\r\nthat they have followed the decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think sometimes we in Singapore tend to view\r\n\r\ndisagreement  as something to be avoided; something  distasteful\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninefficient or even \"unAsian\".  But when we consider the role of\r\n\r\nthe  Judiciary, an equal role, we must give allowance  for  such\r\n\r\ndisagreement  between the Judiciary and the  Executive,  or  the\r\n\r\nJudiciary  and  this  House.  The authority  of  the  courts  to\r\n\r\nadminister  justice  to the ordinary citizen  is  built  on  the\r\n\r\nauthority  of  the courts to do so with all, even  if  it  means\r\n\r\nbeing in disagreement with the highest office in the land.  When\r\n\r\nwe recognise this, we can recognise the power that the Judiciary\r\n\r\nwields  in the name of justice.  Only with such knowledge,  will\r\n\r\nthe  confidence in our judicial system increase.  Only this will\r\n\r\nsend  the  message  that  our courts have  acted  and  will  act\r\n\r\nindependently of the Government.  Then all Singaporeans can join\r\n\r\nin  refuting the scandalous claims others have put forward  that\r\n\r\nour Judiciary is somehow compliant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the second step that I think is needed to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  Constitutional position and the public  standing\r\n\r\nthat  our Judiciary already enjoys.  This is that the House  and\r\n\r\nthe  Executive  should  best  serve the  Constitution  and  this\r\n\r\ncountry   by  conducting  ourselves  in  ways  that   give   due\r\n\r\nrecognition  to the Judiciary's role.  Specifically,  I  caution\r\n\r\nagainst   amendments   to   the   law   designed   to   override\r\n\r\ninterpretations and decisions given by the judges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House makes the law. But the Judiciary interprets it.\r\n\r\nThere  may  therefore  be occasion on  which  we  pass  the  law\r\n\r\nthinking it will have this meaning and this effect, only to have\r\n\r\nthe  judges tell us that it does not, it has a different effect,\r\n\r\nor  that  it  cannot  be given effect. When  that  happens,  the\r\n\r\ntemptation  will be to amend the laws, or even the Constitution,\r\n\r\nabruptly.  This has happened before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been notable amendments to the Internal Security\r\n\r\nAct  in  the late 1980s.  This followed the Judiciary's decision\r\n\r\nin  the landmark case of Chng Suan Tze, that decisions taken  by\r\n\r\nthe   Executive  should  be  subject  to  judicial   review   on\r\n\r\nsubstantive  grounds.  This House reacted then by  amending  the\r\n\r\nlaw  and the Constitution to remove substantive judicial  review\r\n\r\nand limit the courts to the review of procedure only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amendments removed the ISA from full judicial scrutiny.   It\r\n\r\nmade the Executive the arbiter over the substance of ISA cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even as we recognise that fact, we must also recognise\r\n\r\nthat this is a very narrow exception.  For the vast majority  of\r\n\r\nlaws,  which  Singaporeans live under every day,  the  Judiciary\r\n\r\nremains the final arbiter, not the Executive.  What then must be\r\n\r\ndone  is to restrict the exception, and not to allow it ever  to\r\n\r\nbecome  the  rule.   It  of  course remains  the  right  of  the\r\n\r\nExecutive  to appeal the decision of a judge to a higher  court.\r\n\r\nIt is also within the power of this House to amend the laws, and\r\n\r\ngiven  the  large majority enjoyed by the party  in  power,  the\r\n\r\nConstitution as well.  But I, as an NMP, hope that this power to\r\n\r\nmake  and amend laws in the face of Judicial decisions  will  be\r\n\r\nexercised  sparingly.  The process of making and  amending  laws\r\n\r\nneeds  a  sea  change,  I believe.  This House  should  override\r\n\r\njudicial decisions by amending laws or making new ones only with\r\n\r\ncompelling reasons and after a thorough discussion, both in this\r\n\r\nChamber,  and  by  such means as Select Committees.   This  hope\r\n\r\nextends to the recent instances I have mentioned in which courts\r\n\r\nhave given decisions that the Executive may disagree with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I humbly submit in that sense, that the question facing us\r\n\r\nin  this  House in such situations is not: Can this House  amend\r\n\r\nthe  laws?   Of course, we can.  The question is not:  Will  the\r\n\r\nExecutive be able to act more efficiently if we change  the  law\r\n\r\nand  exclude judicial review?  It almost certainly will be.  The\r\n\r\nquestion  should be: Has the court acted within its powers?   If\r\n\r\nit  has,  this House should recognise this is the constitutional\r\n\r\nscheme  of things and give serious pause before overriding  that\r\n\r\ndecision by amendment of new laws and limiting judicial review.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt in my mind that Singapore has enjoyed\r\n\r\ngood Government, and benefited from an Executive and bureaucracy\r\n\r\nthat  has  been  largely efficient, non-corrupt,  effective  and\r\n\r\nlawful.   Singaporeans recognise this.  We must  also  recognise\r\n\r\nthat our nation would also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbenefit from a Judiciary that is given and continues to be given\r\n\r\nits full constitutional measure of power and responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exception that I have mentioned, as regards the ISA,\r\n\r\nmust  be just that - an exception.  In the vast majority of laws\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  the  Judiciary is the  final  arbiter,  not  the\r\n\r\nExecutive nor this House.  Let it remain so.  The  Executive and\r\n\r\nthis  House must be encouraged to ensure it remains so. On these\r\n\r\ngrounds, I regret that I cannot support the present motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the specifics that Mr Jeyaretnam has brought up,\r\n\r\nI  will  confine  my  comments to basically  his  contention  as\r\n\r\nregards  Article  144 of the Constitution and the  role  of  the\r\n\r\nExecutive  as regards seeking the concurrence of Parliament  and\r\n\r\nthe Presidency.  I think there has been some public talk, coffee\r\n\r\nshop  talk,  if you will, that if the President  is  to  be  the\r\n\r\nsecond  key  to our reserves, where was the second key  in  this\r\n\r\ninstance?   But  I think the clarifications that the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  brought  up  upon  questions in  Parliament  have  assuaged\r\n\r\npeople.   The  question  of  reserves has  been  emphasized,  as\r\n\r\nArticle  148G rather than Article 144.  I have not had the  time\r\n\r\nto  peruse  the  detailed opinion given by the Attorney-General,\r\n\r\nbut  I  believe this, and I agree with the Minister of State  on\r\n\r\nthis  point:  the  Government cannot doubt itself.   It  has  an\r\n\r\nopinion  from its Legal Counsel.  There is an urgent  situation.\r\n\r\nThere is a need, therefore, to move forward.  No government ever\r\n\r\nin  the world, when faced with such exigencies, will give  pause\r\n\r\nand say, \"Well, even though I think, and my legal advisers think\r\n\r\nwe  should move on, perhaps for safety's sake, we should hold  a\r\n\r\nconstitutional conference or referendum.\"  These situations take\r\n\r\na  lot  of time and I think in this case, everyone can see  that\r\n\r\ntime  was of the essence to restore confidence to Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nthe  region  and  for  our  foreign relations.   What  then  has\r\n\r\nhappened  now,  and this is an important step for Singapore,  is\r\n\r\nthat there will  be full transparency and discussion of both the\r\n\r\nsubstance of the decision and the process of decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think finally we must come to this point. That Article\r\n\r\n100  of the Constitution, which is created by the Executive, was\r\n\r\nto  give the right to refer  matters on Constitutional questions\r\n\r\nto  one person - the President, not to me, not to Mr Jeyaretnam,\r\n\r\nnot to any Member of this House.  Article 100 says the President\r\n\r\nhas  the power to refer the matter to a Constitutional Tribunal.\r\n\r\nAnd  the President has chosen, in this case, to remain, to allow\r\n\r\nit, at least, by silence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should stop here because my understanding of\r\n\r\nStanding  Order No. 48(8) is that the conduct of  the  President\r\n\r\nshall not be open to discussion in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy   Speaker,  Sir,  the  legislation  of  a  nation  should\r\n\r\nbasically  provide  for   the  Government  to  make  a  resolute\r\n\r\ndecision in an emergency so that they could take rapid action to\r\n\r\nprotect  the interest of the nation.  At the moment, the  entire\r\n\r\nregion is faced with a  financial turmoil that is affecting  our\r\n\r\nnation.    We should therefore be concerned with  how  to  unite\r\n\r\nourselves   and  to  take  effective  measures   to  boost   the\r\n\r\nconfidence   of   the  region,  particularly  our   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries.  Under such circumstances, our Government has, at the\r\n\r\nrequest  of the Indonesian Government,  agreed to grant  them  a\r\n\r\nloan  of US$5 billion so that they can tide over their financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  We should be more understanding   and   give  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  the support.  After all,  Indonesia, like  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nis our immediate neighbour and one of our most important trading\r\n\r\npartners.  Their economic development is closely linked to ours.\r\n\r\nIf  the  crisis in Indonesia continues, it would gravely  affect\r\n\r\nour economic development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On these premises, and at the request of the Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment, we give them a helping hand.  I think this would  go\r\n\r\na  long  way  to benefit our economic interests.  Of course,  we\r\n\r\nmust ensure that they make good use of this money and  repay the\r\n\r\nloan as promised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at a time when we are faced with such a crisis, we\r\n\r\nshould  rally  behind  our Government and  I  feel  it  is  most\r\n\r\ninappropriate  to  move such a motion at  this  point  of  time.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I do not support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  my colleague, the Minister of State, Assoc.  Prof.  Ho\r\n\r\nPeng  Kee,  has  given  a  very  comprehensive  response  to  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  and it had not been my intention to take the  floor.\r\n\r\nBut  I do so after listening to Mr  Simon Tay who, I think, made\r\n\r\na  very lucid and scholarly presentation of the respective roles\r\n\r\nof  the Executive, Legislature and the Judiciary.  For the  most\r\n\r\npart  of  his  presentation, I have very little  differences  of\r\n\r\nview.   But  the  reason  I take the floor  is  because  of  his\r\n\r\ncomments  on  the  need  to ensure that  when  the  courts  have\r\n\r\npronounced  on  interpretation of the laws or the  Constitution,\r\n\r\nthe  Government or the legislature should not override (the term\r\n\r\nused   is   \"override\")  the  judgment,  except  in  exceptional\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure him that when the Government has occasion to\r\n\r\namend  the  law,  it is not because of wanting to  override  the\r\n\r\ndecision.  As he has very well put it, the job of Parliament  is\r\n\r\nto  enact laws which reflect Government's policy.  The  role  of\r\n\r\nthe  Judiciary  is  to  interpret the laws,  and  he  is  right.\r\n\r\nSometimes the courts may arrive at an interpretation which might\r\n\r\nnot  have been the interpretation that had been intended by  the\r\n\r\nlegislature or the Government.  In that kind of a situation, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will have to examine the judgement, because as Assoc.\r\n\r\nProf.  Ho Peng Kee, the Minister of State, ended up his  speech,\r\n\r\nthe job of Government is to govern, and to govern effectively to\r\n\r\ndefend  and  advance Singapore's national interests  in  various\r\n\r\nfields  -  economics,  internal security and  a  whole  area  of\r\n\r\ngovernmental functions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He referred to the ISA case. In the ISA case where we had\r\n\r\nto  amend,  the  reasons for amendment were very clearly  stated\r\n\r\nand,  that is, it had always been the intention that the  merits\r\n\r\nof the Government, the Executive's decision, under the ISA ought\r\n\r\nnot to be justiciable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat  can  be reviewed is compliance with legal procedure.   And\r\n\r\nsince I moved those amendments in this House, I can assure  him,\r\n\r\n(and  this can be verified by reference to records) I  had  also\r\n\r\nexpressed  concern  about the trends in Europe  and  in  England\r\n\r\nwhere because of the influence of the European courts, they were\r\n\r\nmoving  in a direction which was not in our interest.  Therefore\r\n\r\nwhen we amended it, it was clearly with a view to ensure that in\r\n\r\nthe  area  of internal security, the Executive will be  able  to\r\n\r\npromote  Singapore's national interest.  That is not to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  there is a disrespect for the Judiciary because  precisely\r\n\r\nwe  respect the Judiciary's decision, we have to amend the  laws\r\n\r\nand  the Constitution to ensure that Government's intention  and\r\n\r\npolicy  objectives are correctly reflected in the law.   If  the\r\n\r\ncourt  had arrived at a different interpretation, then we  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  remedy by amendments to the law.  That is not anything\r\n\r\nsinister  or  undesirable.  That is a part of  the  function  of\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned two of many examples where the courts had\r\n\r\ntaken  a  position  of disagreeing with the  interpretation  and\r\n\r\nholding against Government.  Of those two examples, one was  the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Secrets Act case.  Let me say that we have  asked  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General  to give us his considered  views  because  his\r\n\r\npreliminary review was, and is, that if the law is not  amended,\r\n\r\nthen  it  may  render  it impossible or well-nigh  difficult  to\r\n\r\nenforce  the provisions of the Official Secrets Act.   Since  he\r\n\r\nmentioned  it, I want to make it clear in the House  that  there\r\n\r\nmay well be a need to amend the Official Secrets Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other example he mentioned was the recent decision that\r\n\r\nsection   37   of   the   Prevention  of   Corruption   Act   is\r\n\r\nunconstitutional.  And here, as Members will note, I have  given\r\n\r\na  comment  to  the press that, yes, we will also  examine  that\r\n\r\ndecision  because  it has very serious implications.   The  fact\r\n\r\nthat we are reviewing it does not mean there is a disrespect  of\r\n\r\nthe Judiciary's decision.  But we have to examine what is it  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's interest in respect of advancing our objectives  and\r\n\r\nhigh  standards of non-corruption and whether, if that  decision\r\n\r\nin any way renders it difficult to advance our national interest\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprevention of corruption, we need to amend the law.  In  so  far\r\n\r\nas  the  judge  has pronounced that the law was unconstitutional\r\n\r\nbecause Parliament did not have power to enact extra-territorial\r\n\r\nlegislation, that also has very serious implications because the\r\n\r\npreliminary advice from the Attorney-General is that it  renders\r\n\r\nit  impossible to comply with our international law  obligations\r\n\r\nand  our  obligations  under certain international  conventions,\r\n\r\nincluding,  for example, exercising jurisdiction over  hijacking\r\n\r\noffences  committed  abroad.   Therefore,  this  is  also  being\r\n\r\nstudied.  I thought I should mention this now so that if I  have\r\n\r\nto come to Parliament later to make amendments to these laws, Mr\r\n\r\nSimon  Tay  would  not be surprised or allege that  I  have  not\r\n\r\nmentioned this at all during the sitting.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, do you want to reply to the\r\n\r\nmisunderstood part?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I want to mention briefly ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think there is a point of order. The\r\n\r\nMember  has  only  one chance to speak.  Unless  he  is  seeking\r\n\r\nclarification  of what the Minister had said, he has  no  second\r\n\r\nchance of reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not intend to\r\n\r\nkeep  the House very long in my reply because I think I can deal\r\n\r\nvery  shortly  with all that had been said by  the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState.   But before I begin to reply to him, may I say I  resent\r\n\r\nhis  descent into a personal attack by saying that I  am  moving\r\n\r\nthis  or asking for this because I am craving for publicity.   I\r\n\r\nhave  heard  this  several times.  That is always  the  standard\r\n\r\nreply  of  the  PAP if somebody asks for anything,  \"Oh,  he  is\r\n\r\ncraving for publicity.\"  They forget that the Ministers and  the\r\n\r\nPAP  occupy the whole of the media space and time.  So  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  crave  for  publicity  but anyone  who  tries  to  question\r\n\r\nanything  craves for publicity.  So I do resent this.  It  casts\r\n\r\ndoubts on my motives and on my sincerity which I do resent  very\r\n\r\nstrongly.   And  he  also goes on to suggest  that  I  am  being\r\n\r\nhypocritical.  I have heard this so many times.  It  is  nothing\r\n\r\nnew.   But  I find it surprising that it should come  from  this\r\n\r\nMinister of State now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now reply to his points. The Minister refers to the\r\n\r\npress releases by my Party and the answers from the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLaw  and  he says it is an absurd position taken by the Workers'\r\n\r\nParty  to ask for costs.  May I say this.  When replying to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  statement  made in the first instance  that  it  was\r\n\r\nalways  open  to the Workers' Party to refer the matter  to  the\r\n\r\ncourt,  I  had  overlooked quite candidly Article  100A  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.   And so we said, \"Yes, all right,  we  will  take\r\n\r\nit.\"  But we do not want to be burdened with the costs of it, if\r\n\r\nwe  should be proved to be wrong.  We are quite happy  to  admit\r\n\r\nthat  we  may  be  wrong.   We do not  take  the  stand  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  it is always right, that nobody  else  can  be\r\n\r\nright.   We said that we did not want to be burdened and  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  the Government knows the Workers' Party does  not  have\r\n\r\nthe  funds  to pay the cost and no one will help us  with  these\r\n\r\nfunds  because of the climate of fear in Singapore.  So  we  are\r\n\r\nnot  ashamed of the fact that we cannot ourselves bear any cost.\r\n\r\nBut  one would have expected the Government to have said,  \"Yes,\r\n\r\nplease  do,  we  will let this matter be decided  without  costs\r\n\r\nbecoming  a  stumbling  block.\"  But,  no.   The  Minister  very\r\n\r\nconveniently  forgets what I have pointed  out,  which  I  later\r\n\r\nrealised, that the Workers' Party could not have taken  this  to\r\n\r\nthe  tribunal.  It had to be only by the President but Simon Tay\r\n\r\nalso knows that the President acts on the advice of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nHe is required to act on the advice of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> So the Cabinet has to advise him to refer\r\n\r\nthe  matter to the tribunal.  And so ultimately it is a decision\r\n\r\nfor  the  Cabinet to take.  The Minister says, \"Oh, we  got  the\r\n\r\nopinion of the Attorney-General.  It is so crystal clear to us.\"\r\n\r\nIt  completely misses the point I have tried to get across.   It\r\n\r\nis  not  for this House.  It is not for the Attorney-General  to\r\n\r\nsay  what  the  law means.  He may have his views  like  anybody\r\n\r\nelse.   But he may be wrong.  He is not infallible.  And  as  Mr\r\n\r\nSimon Tay has rightly pointed out and underscored, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinal  arbiter of this question is the Judiciary.   So  what  is\r\n\r\nwrong  if you feel that you are right, that it cannot be  wrong?\r\n\r\nWhat is so very difficult about referring it to the tribunal and\r\n\r\ngetting  them  to  confirm that you are indeed right,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is indeed right?  But as I said, it is  not  for  us\r\n\r\nhere to decide.  I know Mr Simon Tay says that he now thinks the\r\n\r\nGovernment's interpretation is right.  It may well be right.   I\r\n\r\ndo not know.  But I said, let us have a decision by the tribunal\r\n\r\nwhich is competent to decide this question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says, \"Will Mr Jeyaretnam take the trouble to\r\n\r\nread  the  opinion?\"  I have not gone through it very  carefully\r\n\r\nbut  because  he picked out paragraph 8, he says Mr Jeyaretnam's\r\n\r\ninterpretation is wrong because if he is right,  it  would  mean\r\n\r\nthat the Government may not give car loans or computer loans  to\r\n\r\ncivil  servants.  Well, I was amazed to see that because I would\r\n\r\nhave  thought that provision would have been made in the  Budget\r\n\r\nevery  year.  Provision would have been made in the  Budget  for\r\n\r\ncar  loans in Ministries and Government offices, and the  Budget\r\n\r\nwould have been passed by Parliament and then assented to by the\r\n\r\nPresident.  So there is parliamentary approval for loans to  its\r\n\r\nofficials to be made by the Government.  The provision has to be\r\n\r\nmade  in  the  Budget.  The money is not taken  from  any  other\r\n\r\nassets  or  reserves,  for these car loans.   So  the  Attorney-General  is  clearly wrong on that.  It is so elementary  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  he  overlooks that that would have been  included  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget.  And is the Minister ---\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, Prof. Ho wants to\r\n\r\nclarify.  Do you want to give way?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I just want to ask Mr Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\ntwo things.  First, whether he had also considered, not just the\r\n\r\nroute  through Article 100 of the Constitution, but  to  seek  a\r\n\r\ndeclaration in the High Court as to the constitutionality of the\r\n\r\nExecutive action, which is what the Ministry of Law alluded to - unless we have to spell it out specifically.  But we said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  was  free to do so.  We know the interpretation  of  Article\r\n\r\n100.  But there is this other route.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point of clarification is the loans. I would\r\n\r\nsuggest he takes time to read the whole opinion of the AG before\r\n\r\nhe  talks  about  Parliament giving blanket  approval  to  grant\r\n\r\nloans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Well, I will do. But that does not\r\n\r\nnecessarily mean because the Attorney-General gives his opinion,\r\n\r\nand  to  you, it is crystal clear, or to the Government,  it  is\r\n\r\ncrystal  clear,  that the Attorney-General is  right,  with  due\r\n\r\nrespect  to the Attorney-General.  May I just answer this  point\r\n\r\non  which  clarification was sought.  Of  course,  the  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty can ask for a declaration by way of an action in the  High\r\n\r\nCourt.   But  there  is already provision in  the  Constitution,\r\n\r\nthere  is  this  machinery set up.  There is  a  tribunal.   Why\r\n\r\nshould we be asked to go by an ordinary action in the High Court\r\n\r\nwhen  it is the tribunal which has been invested with the powers\r\n\r\nto   determine  any  opinion  as  to  what  an  Article  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  means?  I do not quite understand  the  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  you can go that way, you can go this way when already  the\r\n\r\nway  has  been provided for you.  There is one way set  out  for\r\n\r\nyou.  [Interruption by Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee.]  Whether it is\r\n\r\nthe Workers' Party or not, would the Government concede, please,\r\n\r\nfor  the last time that this is a matter of public concern?  The\r\n\r\npublic wants to know whether in agreeing to give $8 billion loan\r\n\r\nto  Indonesia, the Government acted under the Constitution.   Is\r\n\r\nit  a  matter  for the public, for the taxpayers?   Or  are  you\r\n\r\nsaying it is only a matter for the Workers' Party?  The Workers'\r\n\r\nParty  tries to represent the people.  It does not act as though\r\n\r\nit is a law unto itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. He says that the AG is not a\r\n\r\nmember of the Executive, if I have understood him correctly.  He\r\n\r\nsays he is the chief legal advisor.  Does that mean he is not  a\r\n\r\nmember of the Executive?  He can be a legal advisor but does  it\r\n\r\nnot mean he is a member of the Executive?  What is he?  A member\r\n\r\nof  the Judiciary?  Or is he a member of this Parliament?  He is\r\n\r\na member of the Executive.  He is the chief legal advisor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touches on the decision of the Privy Council and, if I\r\n\r\nunderstood  him  correctly, he says the  Privy  Council  has  no\r\n\r\njurisdiction  to examine convictions.  I am surprised  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State makes the same mistake that has been made over\r\n\r\nand over again by others.  Is the Minister ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, can I just\r\n\r\nclarify  on this point?  Like I said, first, the case  has  been\r\n\r\nfully  ventilated  in the press, exchange of  letters,  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, and the Government's position has remained consistent all\r\n\r\nthis time.  As regards the comments made by the Privy Council in\r\n\r\nrelation to Mr Jeyaretnam's criminal convictions, these comments\r\n\r\nare  not binding on the Government because the Privy Council was\r\n\r\nnot  seized of the matter, ie, criminal convictions,  they  were\r\n\r\nexamining Mr Jeyaretnam's appeal against his debarment.  And the\r\n\r\nPrivy  Council, in its judgement, said as such that the comments\r\n\r\ncould  not overturn the criminal convictions.  And in fact,  the\r\n\r\nposition  taken by the Government was also backed up by comments\r\n\r\nof  an English judge, Justice Brooke, who agreed with the points\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Government.  So it is not just a  matter  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or the AG making these points, but even  an  outside\r\n\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Again, may I say I am surprised at what I\r\n\r\nhave heard.  Perhaps, I should say, first of all, what was\r\n\r\nbefore the Privy Council was not the order of convictions made\r\n\r\nby the criminal court.  What was before the Privy Council was\r\n\r\nthe order of the High Court disbarring me from practice as a\r\n\r\nlawyer.  So that was what they were hearing.  And as they\r\n\r\nthemselves observed, they had the power to set aside that order\r\n\r\nand they set aside that order.  They had the jurisdiction and I\r\n\r\nam sure the Minister of State for Law must know this.  That even\r\n\r\nbefore that decision, there was a High Court decision in\r\n\r\nSingapore which said that the court listening to a disciplinary\r\n\r\nproceeding against a lawyer can, in proper cases, go behind the\r\n\r\nconvictions.  So that was established as the law.  And the Privy\r\n\r\nCouncil said, \"Of course, that is the law.  In proper cases, we\r\n\r\ncan go behind the convictions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo   they  had  the  jurisdiction  and  they  went  behind   the\r\n\r\nconvictions,  acting perfectly within their  jurisdiction.   But\r\n\r\nthey said, \"Unfortunately for this man here (I was there at that\r\n\r\ntime)   we   cannot  set  aside  the  convictions  because   the\r\n\r\nconvictions are not before us.\"  But that does not make  it  any\r\n\r\nless a decision of the Privy Council on those convictions.  They\r\n\r\nwere  saying the convictions were all wrong.  And that  was  the\r\n\r\nreason for setting aside the order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the Minister has now referred to this judgement\r\n\r\nof  Justice Brooke.  Justice Brooke is just an ordinary judge of\r\n\r\nthe  High  Court of England.  He does not rank above  the  Privy\r\n\r\nCouncil and he is being quoted out of context by the PAP leaders\r\n\r\ntime  and time again.  He was not saying that the Privy  Council\r\n\r\nwas  wrong in saying that the convictions were wrong.   What  he\r\n\r\nwas affirming again was that the convictions were not before the\r\n\r\nPrivy  Council  and,  since  it had  not  been  set  aside,  the\r\n\r\nconvictions still remained.  Of course, that is true.   But  the\r\n\r\nPrivy Council itself said that they hoped - they did not say  in\r\n\r\nso  many words - that the President would do something about it.\r\n\r\nBut the President of course refused to do anything about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I just deal with Mr Jayakumar's reply. He was\r\n\r\nnot replying to me but he was replying to Mr Simon Tay.  He says\r\n\r\nthat  when the Government amends the law following any  decision\r\n\r\nby  the  court,  it is not meant to show any disrespect  to  the\r\n\r\ncourt.  May I remind him whether he has forgotten that after the\r\n\r\ndecision  by the Privy Council, immediately the first thing  the\r\n\r\nGovernment did was to pass a law abolishing all appeals  to  the\r\n\r\nPrivy  Council  from lawyers who have been found guilty  or  who\r\n\r\nhave  been disbarred, preventing them from taking it up  to  the\r\n\r\nPrivy  Council.   Is  that not a decision taken  in  pique  just\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Privy Council had the temerity to comment  on  the\r\n\r\ndecision?  Equally, was that not the reason for the decision  to\r\n\r\nexclude  the courts from inquiring into the merits of  detention\r\n\r\nunder  the Internal Security Act taken out of pique because  the\r\n\r\nCourt of Appeal had said the courts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  enquire  into  the merits?  The Court of  Appeal  was  only\r\n\r\nfollowing   what  had  been  established  in   so   many   other\r\n\r\njurisdictions that the freedom of a subject is so vital that the\r\n\r\ncourts  have to determine and remain the final judges on whether\r\n\r\nthe  imprisonment or detention is illegal.  They  overruled  the\r\n\r\n1942  decision  taken  in  the war time  that  it  was  for  the\r\n\r\nExecutive   to  decide  that.   But  of  course  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  could not accept all that.  So the immediate  answer\r\n\r\nwas `out with all appeals'.  We will be our own masters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret that no attempt has really been\r\n\r\nmade  to grasp the point that I was making.  Instead of that,  a\r\n\r\nlot  of irrelevant statements were made.  The point that  I  was\r\n\r\nmaking  is simply this.  It is not that the Attorney-General  is\r\n\r\nwrong and that we are right, but the point that I was making is:\r\n\r\nwas the Government seen and manifestly seen to have acted within\r\n\r\nthe  terms  of  the Constitution and that could only  have  been\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  if the decision had been referred to the  tribunal\r\n\r\nand  the  tribunal had said, \"Yes.  Of course, in our view,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has acted within the law.\"  That is all I was asking.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  the great reluctance on the part of the Government  to\r\n\r\nrefer the merit to the tribunal?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion accordingly negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BYPASSING OF PARLIAMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, are you going to speak on\r\n\r\nthe same matter again?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> No. I am going to speak on a different\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> This time on Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the last motion was a plea that the\r\n\r\nExecutive should allow the courts to fulfill their role given to\r\n\r\nthem  under  the Constitution.  In this motion, I  am  making  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  plea  for Parliament.  I am asking this  House  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  Parliament  should  be allowed its  full  role  under  the\r\n\r\ndivision of powers that we accepted, and that Parliament  should\r\n\r\nnot  be bypassed, in anything, with the Executive taking all the\r\n\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Parliament under a parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  is supreme.  The government of the day is accountable\r\n\r\nto  Parliament  and the government acts under and in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  laws passed by Parliament, with the Judiciary acting as  a\r\n\r\nwatchdog  to  see  that  the Executive does  act  under  and  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the laws passed by Parliament, that there is  no\r\n\r\ndeviation.   I  think  I said this in my first  speech  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.   This  is the House of the people.  This  is  where  the\r\n\r\npeople expect their views and grievances to be heard and  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven effect.  So it is a matter for regret that this Government\r\n\r\ndoes not allow Parliament its role and functions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of things why I say this. For one\r\n\r\nthing,  sittings  of  Parliament.  I  do  not  know,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, why it is not possible for Parliament to sit  more\r\n\r\noften.   Parliament  should  not be summoned  just  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has got Bills to pass.  The efficiency of Parliament\r\n\r\nis not to be measured by the number of Bills that it has passed.\r\n\r\nThe  efficiency  of  Parliament is to  be  measured  by  how  it\r\n\r\ncontrols   the  Executive.   That  is  how  the  efficiency   of\r\n\r\nParliament  will be measured and judged.  But  we  do  not  have\r\n\r\nenough sittings of Parliament, with the result that Members send\r\n\r\nin  Questions and they cannot all be heard within the  one  hour\r\n\r\nallotted for Question Time.  I think there is an urgent need for\r\n\r\nextending that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the other obvious ignorance of Parliament,\r\n\r\nthat  although Parliament had been elected on 2nd  January  last\r\n\r\nyear, no attempt was made to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconvene  Parliament until the end of May 1997, and the Executive\r\n\r\nchose  to  govern  without Parliament  for  nearly  six  months,\r\n\r\nwithout having Parliament overlook its governance of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to raise the question as to why the Budget could\r\n\r\nnot  have  been presented in March, but Mr Speaker overruled  me\r\n\r\nsaying  that my question was not admissible.  I do not know  why\r\n\r\nit was not admissible but anyway that is not what I am raising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is an urgent need in Singapore if we are to\r\n\r\nlive   up   to   all  our  professions  of  being   transparent,\r\n\r\naccountability,   honest   government   and   all   that,   that\r\n\r\nParliament's role be strengthened and recognised.  I think there\r\n\r\nis  an urgent need for more sittings of Parliament.  There is an\r\n\r\nurgent need for Question Time to be extended.  And there is also\r\n\r\nanother  need  that  Questions addressed to the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nshould be answered by the Prime Minister.  In other Parliaments,\r\n\r\none  or  two days of the sittings every week are set  aside  for\r\n\r\nQuestions to the Prime Minister and he has to attend to  answer.\r\n\r\nBut  here  the Prime Minister would seem to ignore Questions  to\r\n\r\nhim.   I have asked two or three Questions of the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand they were always answered by somebody else.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is a need for us, if Parliament is to be the\r\n\r\nwatchdog,  to  set  up departmental committees  with  powers  to\r\n\r\nsummon  civil  servants and Ministers to explain  any  decisions\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the  Government on any matter.  I know  we  have  got\r\n\r\nGovernment Parliamentary Committees, but they do not serve  that\r\n\r\npurpose.  I have in mind committees, as they have in the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom and in other countries and in the US Congress, with real\r\n\r\npowers  to  question and to summon witnesses  before  them,  the\r\n\r\nExecutive that is.  Of course, these committees should  comprise\r\n\r\nnot  only Government Members but more so the Opposition  Members\r\n\r\nof  Parliament,  because  it  is  the  role  of  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nparticularly to act as the watchdog for the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two instances which would highlight what I have\r\n\r\nbeen trying to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn   7th  October  1997,  I  raised a Question  with  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister for Written Answer whether he would disclose the  names\r\n\r\nof  all public officers who had bought properties in Nassim Jade\r\n\r\nand  Scotts  28.  And I had a written answer from  him  to  say,\r\n\r\n\"There  is  no  impropriety.  We are not going to  disclose  the\r\n\r\nnames  of public officers who bought these properties.\" I  tried\r\n\r\nto tell him that it is not a question of any impropriety.  It is\r\n\r\na  question  of Parliament being told who are the  other  public\r\n\r\nofficers  who  had  bought these properties at  discounts.   The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  refused  to  budge  and  said,  \"There  is   no\r\n\r\nimpropriety.   I  am  not going to tell you who  are  the  other\r\n\r\npublic officers.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should Parliament be bypassed? Why should Parliament\r\n\r\nnot be told?  Public officers are accountable and they should be\r\n\r\nseen to be acting perfectly within the law in anything they  do,\r\n\r\neven if it is a private purchase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the other Question that I raised with the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs, and this was on the retirement of the\r\n\r\nSenior  Assistant  Commissioner of Police, Ong  Seng  Chye.   My\r\n\r\nunderstanding   was   that  this  officer   had   been   retired\r\n\r\nprematurely, that he was retired in the public interest.   So  I\r\n\r\nraised a Question with the Minister for Home Affairs whether  he\r\n\r\nwould  inform Parliament of the circumstances under  which  this\r\n\r\nvery  high  officer  in the Police Force, ie,  Senior  Assistant\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Police, was retired.  And the answer  came,  \"We\r\n\r\ndon't discuss retirement of public officers.\"  Should Parliament\r\n\r\nnot have a right to know why such a senior officer in the Police\r\n\r\nForce,   the Senior Assistant Commissioner, had been retired  in\r\n\r\nthe  public interest?  What had he done that required him to  be\r\n\r\ncompulsorily retired?  These are matters in which Parliament has\r\n\r\na  direct interest and an attempt to shut out information on all\r\n\r\nthese  matters  from  Parliament is  to  minimise  the  role  of\r\n\r\nParliament  and to refuse Parliament to play its  full  role  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know how many millions of\r\n\r\ndollars are being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspent  in  building a new Parliament House, a  grand  Parliament\r\n\r\nHouse.  May I repeat, a grand Parliament House does not make for\r\n\r\nan  effective  role for Parliament to fulfill its functions.   A\r\n\r\nParliament  that  does play its part, its rightful  part,  is  a\r\n\r\nParliament that is given all the opportunities to play its  part\r\n\r\nand  to fulfill its role as the guardian of the liberties of the\r\n\r\npeople  and as a watchdog on the Executive.  So my plea is  that\r\n\r\nit  is  time that a Committee be set up to consider the revision\r\n\r\nof  Standing  Orders of Parliament to see how Parliament's  role\r\n\r\ncan  be  strengthened and given more power, to  examine  whether\r\n\r\ndepartmental  committees should be set  up.   We  will  then  be\r\n\r\nshowing  the  people that we are quite serious in  the  role  of\r\n\r\nParliament   as  their  House,  guardians  of  their  liberties,\r\n\r\nguardians of their rights, and not simply a Parliament  that  is\r\n\r\nhere to pass laws proposed by the Executive.  That is all I have\r\n\r\nto say, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the Member makes, first of\r\n\r\nall,  similar  points.  The point about the loan, I  think,  has\r\n\r\nbeen covered in my reply.  In fact, the point is covered in  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's opinion as to why there was no need  to  come\r\n\r\nto  this House to get Parliament's approval.  That is the  first\r\n\r\npoint that he makes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he asked whether we should in any case come to\r\n\r\nParliament  to  discuss other matters.   I  think  the  role  of\r\n\r\nParliament is prescribed in the Constitution and in the Standing\r\n\r\nOrders  and  it has been fulfilling this role for  a  long  time\r\n\r\neffectively.   Parliament has functioned  very  well  in  making\r\n\r\nlaws, in enabling Members to come to this House to ask searching\r\n\r\nquestions where Ministers will give answers.  Mr Jeyaretnam, now\r\n\r\nthat  he  is an NCMP, has asked for an enlarged role for himself\r\n\r\nand  for  Parliament.  But the point is that Parliament has  got\r\n\r\nprocedures  that have worked well.  Again, it is just  like  his\r\n\r\nother  point about asking  Government to bring the matter before\r\n\r\nthe constitutional court.  The Government has good reason not to\r\n\r\ndo  it.   Government discloses the reason and we  stand  by  the\r\n\r\nreason. So he asks questions as to why we do not meet more often\r\n\r\nor  why  the Prime Minister does not answer questions.  I  think\r\n\r\nthese are questions which the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeader  of the House and the Prime Minister will have to decide.\r\n\r\nParliament  will  meet when there are matters to  be  discussed,\r\n\r\nwhen  there are Bills to be passed, laws to be made,  and topics\r\n\r\nto be discussed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On matters that the law does not require Parliament's\r\n\r\napproval,  it  is  a  matter  of  judgment  whether  or  not   a\r\n\r\nparliamentary session should be held to discuss the matter, just\r\n\r\nlike  the loan to Indonesia.  As I have explained just now, time\r\n\r\nwas of the essence.  Therefore, this matter was not discussed in\r\n\r\nthe  House.   So  the  Executive must have the  prerogative  and\r\n\r\nexercise  its judgment wisely, unless, of course,   required  by\r\n\r\nlaw.   The  law  does set out certain requirements  as  to  when\r\n\r\nParliament  must  meet  and  what matters  must  be  put  before\r\n\r\nParliament.  For the rest, we have to look at practice, we  have\r\n\r\nto look at what has worked well for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for accountability to the public, yes, of course. In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  have  many Committees already set up  in  Parliament.\r\n\r\nThere  are  Select  Committees to  discuss  specific  Bills  and\r\n\r\nCommittees  such  as  the  Estimates Committee  and  the  Public\r\n\r\nAccounts Committee to discuss expenditure and financial matters.\r\n\r\nSo  there is already in place a system where those matters which\r\n\r\nare  within the purview of Parliament to check on the Executive,\r\n\r\nthey are in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific motion says, \"Bypassing of Parliament\". We\r\n\r\nhave talked just now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout the doctrine of separation of powers where there is a role\r\n\r\nfor  the  Executive, a role for Parliament and a  role  for  the\r\n\r\nJudiciary.   So each organ has a role to play.   So my  response\r\n\r\nto  Mr  Jeyaretnam  is  that  the  Executive  is  not  bypassing\r\n\r\nParliament.   Just like my response just now, the  Executive  is\r\n\r\nnot  showing  disrespect to the Judiciary  by  not  putting  the\r\n\r\nmatter before the constitutional court, as asked by the Workers'\r\n\r\nParty,  my  response now will be the Executive is not  bypassing\r\n\r\nParliament.  Matters which require parliamentary approval,  yes,\r\n\r\nwe  will  seek  it.  Matters which do not, it  is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\njudgment  on the part of the Executive whether that matter  will\r\n\r\nbe  brought  to  Parliament.   Rest assured,  please,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  observes the Constitution, Government  observes  the\r\n\r\nlaws and procedures in carrying out its functions.  In any case,\r\n\r\nas  I  have  mentioned  just now, Government  accountability  is\r\n\r\ncaptured in a poignant form during Question Time.  Question Time\r\n\r\nis  one hour every time we meet.  I think matters are dealt with\r\n\r\nand  questions are answered.  There are other matters which must\r\n\r\nbe dealt with.  Therefore, we should not lengthen Question Time.\r\n\r\nThat  is all I want to say.  Sir, it is really a repeat  of  the\r\n\r\nearlier motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Eight Minutes to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Six o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CLOSURE OF MICROPOLIS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Minister for Finance to\r\n\r\ninform the House (i) what led to the closure of Micropolis  just\r\n\r\nunder 2 years after Singapore Technologies acquired the company;\r\n\r\n(ii)  what  went wrong in the process of the acquisition;  (iii)\r\n\r\nhow  much money was lost from the acquisition to the closure  of\r\n\r\nthe  company;  and (iv) where did the money for investment  come\r\n\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(i) What led to the closure of Micropolis just under 2 years after Singapore Technologies acquired the company?</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Technologies saw opportunities in the hard disk\r\n\r\ndrive business of Micropolis and decided to buy over Micropolis'\r\n\r\nworldwide  HDD  business  in April 1996.    The  new  Micropolis\r\n\r\nmanagement, which led the acquisition, had expected to turn  the\r\n\r\ncompany around from its previous losses and re-establish it as a\r\n\r\nprofitable high-end disk-drive manufacturer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following its acquisition by Singapore Technologies in\r\n\r\n1996,  Micropolis refocused its range of product  offerings  and\r\n\r\nchanged  its  market  strategy to focus on  the  OEM   (Original\r\n\r\nEquipment  Manufacturing)  market.   With  the  phasing  out  of\r\n\r\nobsolete products, and the launching of new products, Micropolis\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  secure several new OEM customers.  Micropolis  also\r\n\r\ncontinued to reduce operating losses throughout 1996, and turned\r\n\r\nin a profit for the month of December 1996.  Therefore, although\r\n\r\ntotal  operating  losses  amounted  to  S$76  million  in  1996,\r\n\r\nMicropolis  was  actually  showing gradual  improvement  in  its\r\n\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the high-end disk drive industry took a dramatic\r\n\r\nturn  in  1997,  with  the  aggressive entry  of  several  major\r\n\r\nplayers.   As  most  of  you may know  from  the  various  press\r\n\r\nreports,  there was severe over-capacity in 1997 as a result  of\r\n\r\nsimultaneous  investments by existing  and  new  players.   This\r\n\r\nresulted  in over-supply and intense price competition.   Prices\r\n\r\nwere  dropping at  16% to 18% each quarter in 1997, some 3 times\r\n\r\nthe  normal  rate  of  5% to 6% price erosion  each  quarter  as\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  competed  for market  share.   Industry  analysts\r\n\r\nbelieved  that  the disk drive industry is in the  throes  of  a\r\n\r\nmajor adjustment stretching into 1998.  The leading players have\r\n\r\neither sounded alarm over their earnings prospects or have taken\r\n\r\nsteps to consolidate their operations, including closing plants,\r\n\r\nlaying off workers or delaying new investments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout 1997, Micropolis' operating losses mounted, as\r\n\r\nsales  continued  to fall below projections and product  margins\r\n\r\nwere eroded faster than expected.  There was excess inventory in\r\n\r\nthe  market.   Micropolis was unable to turn  around  with  1997\r\n\r\noperating  losses progressively worsening in the first  half  of\r\n\r\n1997.   By  mid  1997, Micropolis was already exploring  various\r\n\r\nalternatives  for  partnerships or  mergers  with  other  market\r\n\r\nleaders  but  without success.  Prospects for recovery  worsened\r\n\r\nconsiderably   with   the  sharp  change  in   the   competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment as 1997 progressed.   By October 1997, the operating\r\n\r\nloss  for  the year had  reached S$200 million.  Having reviewed\r\n\r\nthe company's business performance, resources and prospects, the\r\n\r\nMicropolis  Board of Directors was left with no  choice  but  to\r\n\r\nwind up the business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(ii) What went wrong in the process of the acquisition?</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to accept that risk-taking is part and parcel of\r\n\r\nall  investment  decisions.  In acquiring Micropolis,  Singapore\r\n\r\nTechnologies had believed that the new management could turn the\r\n\r\ncompany  around by focusing on the high end niche  market  which\r\n\r\nhad been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  profitable  industry segment. Singapore Technologies  carried\r\n\r\nout a four month due diligence with its external consultants  on\r\n\r\nthe  investment before the acquisition.  As it turned  out,  the\r\n\r\nsevere over-capacity in the high-end disk drive market which was\r\n\r\nnot  anticipated by Singapore Technologies was the  main  reason\r\n\r\nwhich made this investment a loss-making venture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(iii) How much money was lost from the acquisition to the closure of the company?</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company is under liquidation. This means that the\r\n\r\nfinancial  affairs  of  Micropolis  are  now  independently  and\r\n\r\nprofessionally managed by experienced liquidators from reputable\r\n\r\ninternational  firms.  They will determine how best  to  recover\r\n\r\nand  dispose  of  the assets of the company in  the  process  of\r\n\r\nliquidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the Statement of Affairs lodged by the Liquidators\r\n\r\nof  Micropolis  in  December  1997,  Micropolis  does  not  have\r\n\r\nsufficient  realisable  assets  to  fully  repay  the  unsecured\r\n\r\ncreditors, including ST.   Recovery expectation is about 10%  of\r\n\r\nthe debts claimed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ST has S$80 million as equity in Micropolis, plus loans\r\n\r\ntotalling  S$550  million.  Part of the loans were  provided  in\r\n\r\n1996  to  fund  working  capital and  production  equipment  for\r\n\r\nMicropolis.  As Micropolis managed to improve its bottomline  in\r\n\r\n1996,  and  turn  in  a profit by December, further  loans  were\r\n\r\nextended  by  ST  in  1997  for additional  working  capital  to\r\n\r\nincrease production capacity for key OEM accounts, and  to  fund\r\n\r\nR&D for new products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus total losses to ST are expected to be the S$80 million\r\n\r\nequity plus some 90% of the outstanding loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(iv) Where did the money for the investment come from?</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Technologies had funded this investment through\r\n\r\nits own internal funds and external commercial borrowings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government did not provide Singapore Technologies with\r\n\r\nany  direct  funding  whether through loan or  equity  for  this\r\n\r\nparticular investment.  However, as Singapore Technologies is  a\r\n\r\n100% government-owned company, this investment loss would result\r\n\r\nin a dimunition of Government's assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INCENTIVES TO LOCAL BANKS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister (a) if\r\n\r\nhe  will  offer incentives to local banks to merge so  that  the\r\n\r\nbanks  may pool resources to compete with foreign banks and  (b)\r\n\r\nif he will consider reviewing shareholding ceilings of the banks\r\n\r\nincorporated in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial services industry is in ferment worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe driving forces are information technology and globalisation.\r\n\r\nFinancial institutions are merging and restructuring,  in  order\r\n\r\nto  derive  growing economies of scale and serve customers  more\r\n\r\nefficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to insulate our domestic banks from these\r\n\r\nlarger trends.
