To a great extent, therefore,\r\n\r\nmy  answer  reflects my personal  thinking  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject  and also what I believe to be the personal\r\n\r\nthinking   of   some  of  my  colleagues   on   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of a casino in Singapore. To be quite\r\n\r\ncandid, I am not at all enamoured of this proposal.\r\n\r\nI  very  much doubt whether tourists would come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore for a gambling spree in a casino. But the\r\n\r\nTourist  Promotion  Board,  who,  after  all,   are\r\n\r\nGovernment's agency for the promotion of tourism in\r\n\r\nSingapore, hold a contrary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nview  and  they tell me that they have  received  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  applications  from  various  syndicates\r\n\r\nabroad. My own inclination would be to vote against\r\n\r\nthis  proposition,  unless it can  be  shown  that,\r\n\r\nfirst,   substantial  benefits  would   accrue   to\r\n\r\nSingapore; second, there will be safeguards against\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens making use of this  casino.  In\r\n\r\nmany   countries   which  allow   casinos   to   be\r\n\r\nestablished, I believe entrance to the  casinos  is\r\n\r\nonly  by  a foreign passport, and if this condition\r\n\r\ncan be observed in the casino here and if it can be\r\n\r\nshown  that  a  casino will be  of  great  economic\r\n\r\nbenefit  to Singapore, then perhaps I may relax  my\r\n\r\nobjections to the establishment of a casino.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of the question, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  there  is  the  danger  of  corruption  of\r\n\r\nmorals,  which moves me and my colleagues  to  have\r\n\r\nthese  views  on the establishment of a  casino  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BOAT RACING</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Promotion of sea sports)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture and Social Affairs, as a means of promoting\r\n\r\nsea-sports  in  the Republic, if he  will  consider\r\n\r\nencouraging the authorities or bodies concerned  to\r\n\r\nintroduce boat racing, usually locally-made  kolehs\r\n\r\nor Chinese dragon-boats, among the universities and\r\n\r\ncolleges  similar  to the traditional  annual  boat\r\n\r\nrace between Oxford and Cambridge Universities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker.

There  has\r\n\r\nbeen much public debate on this subject, some of it\r\n\r\nenlightening,  others less so. The whole  issue  of\r\n\r\nthe devaluation of Sterling and the decision of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government not to devalue  the  currency\r\n\r\nissued  by the Singapore Board of Commissioners  of\r\n\r\nCurrency would have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na perfectly straightforward matter but for the fact\r\n\r\nthat  the old currency circulates side by side with\r\n\r\nthe new one. The intention of the original Currency\r\n\r\nAct, 1967, was to strengthen confidence in the  new\r\n\r\ncurrency as against the old currency, and  one  way\r\n\r\nof  doing this would be to legislate that  the  new\r\n\r\ncurrency shall have at least the same value as  the\r\n\r\nold currency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, history moves in a way which cannot be\r\n\r\nforeseen  even by the most discerning persons,  and\r\n\r\nthe   present  instance  provides  yet   one   more\r\n\r\nmelancholy example of the limitations of the  human\r\n\r\nintellect. For those who drafted the Currency  Act,\r\n\r\n1967,  never imagined that in a matter  of  months,\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  provisions  of  this  Act  would  be\r\n\r\ninconsistent  with those sections of  the  Currency\r\n\r\nAgreement   of  1961  entered  into   between   the\r\n\r\nGovernments of Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. This\r\n\r\nfollows from the decision of the Governments not to\r\n\r\ndevalue the new currency so that parity in terms of\r\n\r\nSterling  increases from 2s.  4d  to  a  dollar  to\r\n\r\nrather  more than 2s. 8d., while the value  of  the\r\n\r\nold  dollar under the Currency Agreement was backed\r\n\r\nat  2s.  4d. Had it not been for the fact that  all\r\n\r\nthe  three Governments were caught at the  time  of\r\n\r\ndevaluation literally in the act of changing horses\r\n\r\nin  mid-stream,  there would have  been  relatively\r\n\r\nlittle  fuss  over  the  decision  to  retain   our\r\n\r\nrespective gold parities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can hardly avoid the controversy over the\r\n\r\ndiffering  values  of  old and  new  currencies,  a\r\n\r\nsubject  which  I had hitherto delicately  avoided,\r\n\r\nbecause  when  people  are  in  a  state  of  great\r\n\r\nexcitement,   they   are   unlikely    to    listen\r\n\r\ndispassionately to the voice of reason. I therefore\r\n\r\ndecided  to  leave the talking on this  subject  to\r\n\r\nbolder  spirits  than myself,  thereby  avoiding  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of public wrath. But now tempers  have\r\n\r\nsubsided  and  I think that this is  the  time  for\r\n\r\nreason and logic to reassert their position.  There\r\n\r\nare two curious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naspects to this subject. The first is that the real\r\n\r\nirritation  and  resentment  that  developed   over\r\n\r\ndiffering  parities had their origins in old  coins\r\n\r\nrather  than in old notes. Only a small  percentage\r\n\r\nof   people  had  hoarded  the  old  notes,   while\r\n\r\neverybody had coins. With the fall in the value  of\r\n\r\nthe  old coins, businesses, had to be conducted not\r\n\r\nin  round numbers, as had hitherto been the  custom\r\n\r\nfor  years,  but in amounts like 17  cents  and  22\r\n\r\ncents.   Since  the  one-cent  coin  had  virtually\r\n\r\ndisappeared  from circulation, transactions  became\r\n\r\nvirtually impossible to carry out, with the  result\r\n\r\nthat tempers were frayed everywhere - in markets, in\r\n\r\nthe  shops, in street stalls, in buses,  in  cinema\r\n\r\nticket booths and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My officials and I had foreseen: these\r\n\r\ndifficulties and on Monday, the 20th November,  the\r\n\r\nday  following the announcement of the  devaluation\r\n\r\nof  Sterling, we urged Kuala Lumpur to  retain  the\r\n\r\nparity of value as between old coins and new coins.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Bank Negara Malaysia was unable  to'\r\n\r\naccept  our  views, though happily four days  later\r\n\r\nboth  Governments agreed, that the one-cent,  five-cent  and  ten-cent old coins should  circulate  at\r\n\r\nparity. This, immediately took the heat out of  the\r\n\r\nsituation    and    enabled    day-to-day    market\r\n\r\ntransactions    to   be   carried    out    without\r\n\r\nrecrimination between buyer and seller  as  to  who\r\n\r\nhad been cheated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect relates to the view that the\r\n\r\nold  notes should not have been devalued  and  that\r\n\r\nany losses sustained by accepting the old notes  at\r\n\r\nthe  value of 2s. 8d. instead of 2s. 4d. could  and\r\n\r\nshould have been borne by the Government. The  more\r\n\r\nknowledgeable  people  say  that  since   the   old\r\n\r\nCurrency  Board, had a cover of 110  per  cent  and\r\n\r\nsince  some old notes are bound to be lost, through\r\n\r\nfire  or other means of destruction, the loss  that\r\n\r\nwould  finally be borne by the Government would  be\r\n\r\nsmall. How much substance is there in this kind  of\r\n\r\nargument?  Sir, I am afraid I can see  very  little\r\n\r\nmerit in it. People who are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nengaged   on   both  sides  of  this  debate   have\r\n\r\noverlooked a basic point, that this is really not a\r\n\r\nquestion of transferring assets from government  to\r\n\r\nholders  of  old notes. If this were so,  then  the\r\n\r\nquestions  one  has  to  answer  would  be:   Could\r\n\r\nGovernment have afforded it? How do we overcome the\r\n\r\ntechnical  difficulties  of  the  legally   defined\r\n\r\nparity  of  2s. 4d. for the old dollar?  These  can\r\n\r\nbecome relevant issues. However, I believe that the\r\n\r\nreal truth is that to pay holders of old notes  the\r\n\r\nsame value as the new currency does not involve the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of assets between the Currency Board  and\r\n\r\nthe Government on the one hand, and the holders  of\r\n\r\nold  notes  on the other. It involves nothing  less\r\n\r\nthan  redistribution of assets  between  those  who\r\n\r\nhold  the new currency and those who hold  the  old\r\n\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain the position in simple terms to\r\n\r\nhon. Members, because the issue has been clouded by\r\n\r\nirrelevant  arguments as to whether Government  can\r\n\r\nor  cannot afford to make this payment.  For  the\r\n\r\nsake  of argument, let us assume that there are  no\r\n\r\nexcess funds in the old Currency Board's funds, and\r\n\r\nfurther  that there are no reserves upon which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can draw to make the additional payments\r\n\r\nto  holders  of old currency notes. This additional\r\n\r\npayment  would  amount  to  some  $30  million   in\r\n\r\nSingapore and $60 million in Malaysia, if every old\r\n\r\ndollar were to be exchanged for one new dollar  and\r\n\r\nnot  for  87  cents, the additional money  must  be\r\n\r\nobtained  somehow, tinder the assumptions  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  made that there are no surplus funds  in  the\r\n\r\nCurrency Board or in the Government accounts, this\r\n\r\nmoney  must be obtained by new taxation. Therefore,\r\n\r\nto  pay  holders  of old notes the additional  sum,\r\n\r\nGovernment would have to raise some $30 million  as\r\n\r\ntaxes,  and  perhaps  the most  equitable  form  of\r\n\r\ntaxation  in this instance would be a once-and-for-all  poll  tax, say, at the rate of  $15  per  man,\r\n\r\nwoman  or  child. This would mean  that  a  working\r\n\r\nclass family of man, wife and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthree  children  would  have  to  pay  $75  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  who would then pay this sum to  holders\r\n\r\nof  old  currency  notes - the dear  old  ladies  who\r\n\r\nstashed away enormous sums under mattresses!  If  I\r\n\r\nwere  to act in this way, it is obvious that  there\r\n\r\nwould  be  howls  of rage from the populace.  There\r\n\r\nwould  be very few kind words spoken in the defence\r\n\r\nof the rights of holders of old currency notes. All\r\n\r\nthis  is perfectly clear, as is also the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe additional payment of $30 million to holders of\r\n\r\nold  currency notes represents in this  exercise  a\r\n\r\nredistribution  of  assets from  the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  to holders of old currency  notes.  The\r\n\r\nargument   would  not  be  in  the  slightest   way\r\n\r\nnullified  if we were to make this payment  out  of\r\n\r\nreserves  rather  than from taxation.  In  the  end\r\n\r\nGovernment  reserves would go into expenditure  and\r\n\r\nthe present Budget session provides an apt reminder\r\n\r\nof  this truth. We are not a trading concern  where\r\n\r\nsurpluses  are divided as dividends to shareholders\r\n\r\nor  bonuses  to  employees and fees  to  directors.\r\n\r\nCabinet  Ministers do not get additional  pay,  nor\r\n\r\nare  Government  employees paid a bonus  should  we\r\n\r\nreduce expenditure. Surpluses are transferred  from\r\n\r\nthe  Consolidated Fund to the Development  Fund  to\r\n\r\npay  for projects like new schools, housing, roads,\r\n\r\npower  stations, wharves, water supply,  industrial\r\n\r\nestates and all the things which are of benefit  to\r\n\r\nour  citizens. The withdrawal of $30  million  from\r\n\r\nthe  reserve  fund to pay holders of  old  currency\r\n\r\nnotes means that there will be just that less money\r\n\r\nto   spend   on   these   items   and   that   this\r\n\r\nredistribution   of  assets  from  non-holders   to\r\n\r\nholders  of  old currency notes is  none  the  less\r\n\r\nreal,  even  if  there were no new tax  to  finance\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that what I say will remove the common but\r\n\r\nprimitive method of thinking about public  finance,\r\n\r\ni.e.,   when   government  withholds  spending   on\r\n\r\nsomething,  the people are being deprived  and  the\r\n\r\ngovernment benefits. All government funds  are  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of public expenditure, and  the  real\r\n\r\nargument is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat kinds of public expenditure are most conducive\r\n\r\nto  the common good? I am not easily persuaded that\r\n\r\npaying $30 million to holders of old currency notes\r\n\r\nis conducive to the common good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is  difficult for me to support this  amendment\r\n\r\nBill  as  I  have  certain objections  to  make  in\r\n\r\nrespect of this proposed Bill which is to amend the\r\n\r\nCurrency Act of 1967. The most significant point to\r\n\r\nwhich I wish to draw the attention of this House is\r\n\r\nnot  the  amendment  itself but  the  retrospective\r\n\r\neffect  of  the amendment. . Members of this  House\r\n\r\nare  aware that the currency notes and coins issued\r\n\r\nby   the  Commissioners  of  Currency,  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nBritish  Borneo, are stated to be legal tender  for\r\n\r\ntheir full face value according to the provision in\r\n\r\nsection 14(4) of the Currency Act. Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  are  also  aware that the occurrence  of  an\r\n\r\nevent beyond our control - namely the devaluation of\r\n\r\nthe  Pound  Sterling - has resulted in the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  having  to declare  that  the  currency\r\n\r\nnotes  and  coins  issued by the  Commissioners  of\r\n\r\nCurrency,  Malaya  and British Borneo,  are  to  be\r\n\r\ndepreciated  in  value  by about  14  per  cent  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to the national currency of Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nappreciate that this drastic step has to  be  taken\r\n\r\nby the Singapore Government because the old Malayan\r\n\r\ncurrency  was fully backed by the English Sterling,\r\n\r\nwhich  was devalued on Sunday, 19th November, 1967.\r\n\r\nBut  this  depreciation in value has brought  great\r\n\r\nhardship  on  those persons who  have  old  Malayan\r\n\r\ncurrency  in  their  possession,  particularly  the\r\n\r\nworking  class who cannot afford to operate banking\r\n\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as currency notes are\r\n\r\nconcerned, I am of the opinion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  has some  justification  for\r\n\r\ndevaluing the old Malayan currency because the  new\r\n\r\nSingapore  currency has been introduced since  12th\r\n\r\nJune,  1967, which gave ample opportunity for every\r\n\r\nSingaporean to convert his or her holdings  of  the\r\n\r\nold  Malayan  currency notes into the new  national\r\n\r\nSingapore  currency. But in the case of the  coins,\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  Sir,  the  position  is   radically\r\n\r\ndifferent because up to November 1967, no new coins\r\n\r\nhad been introduced or circulated by the Government\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. So by depreciating the value of  the\r\n\r\nold  Malayan  coins in relation  to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nnational   currency,  it  would  appear  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Singapore sought  to  penalise  the\r\n\r\nresidents  of Singapore through no fault  of  their\r\n\r\nown.  As  I  see it the only way that  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncould  be  blamed for holding old Malayan coins  is\r\n\r\nthat they had not changed the old Malayan coins for\r\n\r\nnew  currency  notes  between 12th  June  and  19th\r\n\r\nNovember,  1967. But if they had done  so,  then  a\r\n\r\nmost ridiculous situation would have resulted, that\r\n\r\nis,  no one would be in possession of any coins  at\r\n\r\nall.  Mr Speaker, Sir, such a situation would have\r\n\r\na  disastrous, if not a totally paralysing,  effect\r\n\r\non our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my purpose is to bring to the attention of\r\n\r\nthis  House the grievance of, if not the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  at least the voters of my constituency,\r\n\r\nin  respect of the old devalued Malayan coins which\r\n\r\nwere  the  only coins in active circulation  before\r\n\r\nthe  unfortunate event took place on 19th November,\r\n\r\n1967, it is not so much to criticise the Government\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  but  to  show  how  ridiculous  the\r\n\r\nsituation  had  become.  I  appreciate   that   our\r\n\r\nGovernment, by reason of the fact that it is one of\r\n\r\nthe  three  constituent members  of  the  Board  of\r\n\r\nCommissioners  of  Currency,  Malaya  and   British\r\n\r\nBorneo, is not free to act in a way it thinks  best\r\n\r\nfor  the interest of the people in relation to  the\r\n\r\nquestion of depreciating the value of the old Malayan  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncoins.  It is also obvious, from  the  close\r\n\r\neconomic  link  and proximity of West  Malaysia  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  that  the Singapore  Government  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  take any unilateral action relating  to\r\n\r\nthe  value  of the old Malayan currency  notes  and\r\n\r\ncoins.  If our Government were to declare that  old\r\n\r\nMalayan 20-cent and 50-cent coins are redeemable at\r\n\r\ntheir nominal value, Singapore would be flooded  at\r\n\r\npresent with all the 20-cent and 50-cent coins that\r\n\r\nwere in circulation in West Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Minister for Finance will put up this\r\n\r\nargument, but I would like to inform Members of the\r\n\r\nHouse  how  many 20-cent and 50-cent coins  are  in\r\n\r\nactive circulation. This is from the Report of  the\r\n\r\nBoard  of  Commissioners of  Currency,  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nBritish  Borneo,  1965. The value  of  the  50-cent\r\n\r\ncoins  is $767,037.50, and the value of the 20-cent\r\n\r\ncoins  is  $485,870.00. Assuming  that  from  1965,\r\n\r\nthese  figures have been doubled, then the  20-cent\r\n\r\nand  50-cent  coins  by now in  active  circulation - assuming that every 50-cent and 20-cent coin is in\r\n\r\nactive    circulation   - will   amount   to    only\r\n\r\n$3,758,722.25.  So  it is really  inconceivable  to\r\n\r\nthink   that  the  three  Governments,   that   is,\r\n\r\nSingapore,  Malaysia and Brunei, cannot  afford  to\r\n\r\nredeem one-third of this amount.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am given to understand that\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government played an important  part\r\n\r\nin  the subsequent reversal of the initial decision\r\n\r\nof  the  Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya\r\n\r\nand  British Borneo, to depreciate the value of the\r\n\r\nMalayan coins of whatever denominations in relation\r\n\r\nto the respective national currencies of Singapore,\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  Brunei. This decision,  needless  to\r\n\r\nsay, had caused a lot of confusion among the people\r\n\r\nof  the  three  territories, especially  among  the\r\n\r\nworking class who are the ones dealing in terms  of\r\n\r\ncents instead of dollars. Sir, it was a relief  for\r\n\r\neveryone when the Board subsequently announced that\r\n\r\nthe old Malayan coins of one-cent, five-cent and 10-cent denominations are redeemable at their par\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvalue,  if the Singapore Government could obtain  a\r\n\r\npartial reversal of the decision to depreciate  the\r\n\r\nvalue of the Malayan coins, it is conceivable  that\r\n\r\nif  our Minister for Finance makes a greater effort\r\n\r\nto  persuade  the other two Governments,  then  the\r\n\r\ndecision  reached might be entirely reversed,  that\r\n\r\nis,  20-cent  and 50-cent Malayan  coins  would  be\r\n\r\nredeemable at their par value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to devalue the old Malayan currency,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the coins, is bound to  have  a  far-reaching  effect  on  the  morale  of  the  people.\r\n\r\nRecently  the  three  Governments  made   a   joint\r\n\r\nstatement  that  the  old  Malayan  currency  would\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  redeemable  (of  course,   at   a\r\n\r\ndepreciated  value)  with  regard  to   the   three\r\n\r\nrespective national currencies up to 31st December,\r\n\r\n1968.   The   question  here  is  that   with   the\r\n\r\ndevaluation  of  the  Pound Sterling,  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndistinct  possibility  of  the  U.S, dollar  being\r\n\r\ndevalued  - I am not saying right now, but  assuming\r\n\r\nby  next  month - then what will happen  if  such  a\r\n\r\ndevaluation of the U.S, dollar occurs? It must  not\r\n\r\nbe  forgotten  that a substantial  portion  of  our\r\n\r\nforeign   exchange  holdings  consist  of  American\r\n\r\ndollars.  Does  it  mean that  devaluation  of  the\r\n\r\nAmerican dollar will mean a further depreciation of\r\n\r\nthe  old  Malayan currency? If such a  depreciation\r\n\r\nshould occur within the next month, it might  cause\r\n\r\ngreater confusion, particularly in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nold  Malayan coins. After two weeks of  its  issue,\r\n\r\nnew Singapore coins are hardly in evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish the House would consider seriously\r\n\r\nthe  question  of depreciation of the  old  Malayan\r\n\r\ncurrency  and its effect on the economy.  With  the\r\n\r\ndevaluation  of the Pound Sterling, there  is  much\r\n\r\nspeculation about the possible devaluation of other\r\n\r\ncurrencies, particularly the American currency.  In\r\n\r\nthis context, I am also requesting the House to pay\r\n\r\nmuch  more  attention  to  our  nearest  neighbour,\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Although it has not devalued its national\r\n\r\ncurrency in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nline   with  the  Pound  Sterling,  there  is  much\r\n\r\nspeculation  that  it  might have  to  devalue  its\r\n\r\nnational  currency within a year or two. Since  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government has agreed with the Malaysian\r\n\r\nand   Brunei   Governments  that  their  respective\r\n\r\nnational currencies are to have customary tender in\r\n\r\none  another's  territories, the Government  should\r\n\r\ntake  steps  to  inform the people that  they  hold\r\n\r\nMalaysian and Brunei national currencies  at  their\r\n\r\nown risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of what I have outlined for the\r\n\r\nconsideration of this House, I would  suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government make a further effort  to\r\n\r\nhave  the decision to depreciate the value  of  the\r\n\r\nold  Malayan  20-cent and 50-cent coins  completely\r\n\r\nreversed.  Such a reversal is urgently required  as\r\n\r\nthere  were no new coins available on 19th November\r\n\r\nof  this  year, when the devaluation of  the  Pound\r\n\r\nSterling  was announced. The obligation  to  redeem\r\n\r\nthe 20-cent and 50-cent coins at their par value is\r\n\r\nmoral  and  not legal. But our Finance Minister  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  make it legal by introducing  this  Bill\r\n\r\nwith  a  Certificate  of  Urgency.  But  from   the\r\n\r\npolitical  and  social point of  view,  failure  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out a moral obligation is much more damaging\r\n\r\nthan failure to carry out a legal obligation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the Minister for Finance has  tabled\r\n\r\nthe Currency (Amendment) Bill in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exchange rates have been mentioned in the\r\n\r\nBill,  but  the  one-cent, five-cent  and  ten-cent\r\n\r\ncoins  have been accepted at par value and the  20-cent  and  50-cent coins have not been accepted  at\r\n\r\npar  value. No explanation has been given for this.\r\n\r\nThe  old currency has been devalued by 15 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe  people have lost as a result of such  exchange\r\n\r\nrates.  They  have  not  been  given  enough   time\r\n\r\nbecause,  after  separation, Singapore  has  stated\r\n\r\nthat  a  dollar for a dollar will be given for  the\r\n\r\nold currency, but no time limit was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimposed  at  that  time. So what  will  the  common\r\n\r\npeople  do?  The Minister should think about  this.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is no justification to say that the\r\n\r\nexchange rates are fair. For example, if the  Pound\r\n\r\nSterling  is further devalued tomorrow or  after  a\r\n\r\nfew months, we think that the value of the currency\r\n\r\nwill  still  go down. No assurance has  been  given\r\n\r\nthat  the  same  rate will prevail. What  will  the\r\n\r\nMinister  do  if  the  Pound Sterling  is  devalued\r\n\r\nfurther?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the first point that I\r\n\r\nwant  to make in reply to the last two hon. Members\r\n\r\nis   this.  The  value  of  currencies  and   their\r\n\r\ninternational  backing are not matters  upon  which\r\n\r\none   should  lightly  embark  in  public  address,\r\n\r\nbecause  these are very delicate matters  and  what\r\n\r\nresponsible  people say in public  will  have  some\r\n\r\neffect  on the confidence which is so necessary  in\r\n\r\nthe  smooth  running  of currencies.  Unfortunately\r\n\r\nneither  of  the speakers has shown  the  slightest\r\n\r\nevidence that they understood the subject. There is\r\n\r\nno  reason to believe that the U.S. dollar is going\r\n\r\nto  be  devalued next month. In fact, if the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bras Basah really believes that, then  he  can\r\n\r\nmake a small fortune!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I am saying that there is a\r\n\r\npossibility  of the American dollar being  devalued\r\n\r\nbut not that it will be devalued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, it is loose talk of this\r\n\r\nkind  that creates all sorts of trouble. If you  do\r\n\r\nnot  believe  that  it will be devalued,  then  you\r\n\r\nshould not say so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot follow the figures quoted by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Bras Basah. I have taken down notes  of\r\n\r\nwhat  he  has said about 20-cent coins and  50-cent\r\n\r\ncoins.  He says that the total value in circulation\r\n\r\nis  not large. In 1965 it was $760,000 worth of 50-cent  coins  and $485,000 worth  of  20-cent  coins.\r\n\r\nAdding  these two figures up, he gets  a  total  of $3.2 million. I do not quite follow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  kind of arithmetic. May I urge the Member  to\r\n\r\nread the report more carefully? Now, he cannot have\r\n\r\nit  both  ways.  If  he  says  that  the  value  in\r\n\r\ncirculation of these 20-cent and 50-cent  coins  is\r\n\r\nvery  small, then it does not inflict much hardship\r\n\r\nif  they are devalued, as they have been. The  fact\r\n\r\nof  the matter is, in my estimation, that the  one-cent,  five-cent  and ten-cent  coins  would  total\r\n\r\nsomething  like  two-thirds or more  of  the  total\r\n\r\ncoins  in circulation. In fact, by accepting  these\r\n\r\ncoins at their face value, the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nhas to sustain a loss of $2 million. And if we were\r\n\r\nto take on the other two sets of coins, the 20-cent\r\n\r\nand  50-cent coins, at their face value,  we  would\r\n\r\nsuffer a loss of another million dollars or so; not\r\n\r\nan  awfully big sum, but obviously in these matters\r\n\r\nit is necessary for all concerned to act together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad to note that the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  agrees  that  we  acted  correctly  in   not\r\n\r\naccepting the old notes at their face value.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  that  the Member for Anson  has  raised\r\n\r\nanything new, and I think that my remarks about the\r\n\r\ncomments of the Member for Bras Basah also apply to\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved it-self into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 2 stand part of the Bill.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I seek\r\n\r\nclarification from the Minister for Finance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

In  his  Budget  Speech  last  year  my\r\n\r\npredecessor, now the Defence Minister, gave a  full\r\n\r\naccount  of  the  growing strength of  the  economy\r\n\r\nachieved   in   1966.  Expansion  of  the   economy\r\n\r\ncontinued this year. Trade figures show an  overall\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  8  per cent. In the period  January  to\r\n\r\nSeptember  1966, the total imports and exports  was\r\n\r\n$5,513 million. The same period this year showed an\r\n\r\nincrease to $5,956 million. These are increases  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  value.  Because of the  decline  in  the\r\n\r\nprices of primary products such as rubber and  tin,\r\n\r\nvalue figures understate the growth in the physical\r\n\r\nvolume   of  trade.  The  total  amount  of   cargo\r\n\r\ndischarged and handled this year compared with last\r\n\r\nyear  showed an increase of no less than  15.3  per\r\n\r\ncent  -17.3 million freight tons in the first eight\r\n\r\nmonths of last year compared with 19.9 million tons\r\n\r\nfor  the same period this year. The number of ships\r\n\r\nusing  our  harbour showed an increase of  8.8  per\r\n\r\ncent  over  last  year. In terms  of  tonnage,  the\r\n\r\nincrease was 11.5 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other indicators support the evidence of rapid\r\n\r\ngrowth.  For instance, the volume of bank  deposits\r\n\r\nin  the  first  10  months of this  year  shows  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of no less than 29 per cent - from  $1,312\r\n\r\nmillion  at  the  beginning of the year  to  $1,697\r\n\r\nmillion   at   the   end   of   October.   Building\r\n\r\nconstruction also shows substantial increases.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of new buildings commenced this year showed\r\n\r\nno less than a 66 per cent increase over last year.\r\n\r\nConstruction  of 5,096 units started in  the  first\r\n\r\nsix  months of last year compared with 8,461  units\r\n\r\nfor the same period this year. Private construction\r\n\r\nwas particularly active,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshowing  a  94.5 per cent increase.  $21.8  million\r\n\r\nworth  of private construction was started  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  six  months  of  1966  compared  with  $42.4\r\n\r\nmillion this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of granite continues to increase. In 1966\r\n\r\nit  averaged 100.9 thousand cubic yards a month. In\r\n\r\nthe  last three months of this year the figure  has\r\n\r\nincreased  to  nearly 130 thousand  cubic  yards  a\r\n\r\nmonth, which is more than two and a half times  the\r\n\r\nvolume  in 1961. This is an indication not only  of\r\n\r\nhousing  construction, but also  of  a  substantial\r\n\r\nincrease in the construction of new roads  as  well\r\n\r\nas improvements to old roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a rapid expansion in the tourist\r\n\r\ntrade.  Last year the occupancy rate of first-class\r\n\r\nhotels averaged 84.2 pet cent. Now all these hotels\r\n\r\nare   solidly  booked  several  months  ahead,  and\r\n\r\nthousands of tourists had to be shunted to  second-class  hotels, much to their discomfiture. Business\r\n\r\nexpansion  gene-rated by growth in these and  other\r\n\r\nfields,  has  created an acute shortage  of  office\r\n\r\nspace.  Nor  can  it  be said  that  this  rise  in\r\n\r\naffluence  is  confined only to  the  wealthy.  One\r\n\r\neconomic  indicator  which I  find  interesting  to\r\n\r\nwatch  is  the number of motor cycles and  scooters\r\n\r\nregistered  each  month.  Five  years   ago,   this\r\n\r\naveraged  548 per month; the average for  the  last\r\n\r\nthree  months was 1,258. This gives some indication\r\n\r\nthat  the  skilled  artisan and  the  white  collar\r\n\r\nworker are also benefiting from economic expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the reasons for the good performance of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economy this year? I think  there  are\r\n\r\nthree main reasons. First, the growth of trade with\r\n\r\nIndonesia;  second, expansion of exports  to  South\r\n\r\nVietnam;  third,  a  substantial  increase  in  the\r\n\r\ninflow of Hong Kong industry into Singapore. Let me\r\n\r\ndeal  with each of these factors in turn. The total\r\n\r\nmerchandise  trade  with Indonesia  in  1967,  i.e.\r\n\r\ntrade  excluding petroleum and petroleum  products,\r\n\r\nis  likely to surpass the pre-confrontation  level.\r\n\r\nThe oil trade with Indonesia, which was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery substantial before confrontation, is now but a\r\n\r\nshadow  of its former self. We used to import  more\r\n\r\nthan  $200  million  worth  of  oil  products  from\r\n\r\nIndonesia  a  year and export $90 million  to  her.\r\n\r\nImports  are  now  running at a third  of  previous\r\n\r\nlevels and oil exports to Indonesia are negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture, however, is different with the\r\n\r\nmerchandise trade. Before confrontation,  Singapore\r\n\r\nwas  importing an average of 30,000 tons of  rubber\r\n\r\nper  month  as  well  as  a substantial  volume  of\r\n\r\ncoffee,  pepper, copra and other tropical  produce.\r\n\r\nBut  the  rubber trade accounts for more than  two-thirds  of the value of imports from Indonesia.  By\r\n\r\nSeptember this year the physical volume of  imports\r\n\r\nof   rubber   had  exceeded  the  pre-confrontation\r\n\r\naverage of 30,000 tons a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the exports side, performance this year is\r\n\r\nlikely to surpass the highest level achieved before\r\n\r\nconfrontation, and that was in 1962. In that  year,\r\n\r\nour  exports  of  merchandise, excluding  petroleum\r\n\r\nproducts, to Indonesia amounted to $226.5  million.\r\n\r\nThis  year the figure is likely to be in the region\r\n\r\nof  $355 million. One reason for this is the  ready\r\n\r\navailability   of  supplies  of  manufactures   now\r\n\r\nproduced by our new industries such as wheat flour,\r\n\r\ngalvanised  iron  sheets, cement,  iron  and  steel\r\n\r\nconstruction  material and so  on.  Early  delivery\r\n\r\ndates  and attractive credit facilities had enabled\r\n\r\nus  to  increase by a very substantial  amount  our\r\n\r\nexport trade to Indonesia. Also the rational policy\r\n\r\nof  the  Government of Indonesia in granting export\r\n\r\nbonus  certificates  has  helped  to  increase  the\r\n\r\nsupplies    of    necessities    - foodstuffs    and\r\n\r\nconstruction material - to Indonesia. The  expansion\r\n\r\nof  our  trade  with Indonesia is  undoubtedly  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  reason for the present buoyancy  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Hong Kong industrialists, I reported\r\n\r\nto  Parliament  on  the 2nd November  that  a  very\r\n\r\nsubstantial   number  of  them   have   made   firm\r\n\r\narrangements to establish manufacturing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfacilities  in  Singapore. The  number  since  then\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  grow at a gratifying rate  and  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  industrialists have bought up  all  available\r\n\r\nfactory    accommodation   - both   those   recently\r\n\r\ncompleted  as well as under construction.  It  has,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   been  necessary  to  mount   a   crash\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  new  factory building  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  Hong Kong industrialists  as  all\r\n\r\navailable buildings have already been taken  up  by\r\n\r\nthem.  This is being done in the Kallang industrial\r\n\r\nestate   as   well  as  in  Jurong.  The   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  has now under  construction  no\r\n\r\nless  than  131 factories which would be leased  or\r\n\r\nrented out on completion to industrialists. Tenders\r\n\r\nfor  another 76 factories will soon be called  for.\r\n\r\nThirty of the 131 factories under construction  are\r\n\r\nin  Jurong  and  the rest are in the Kallang  Basin\r\n\r\nIndustrial   Estate,  Redhill  Industrial   Estate,\r\n\r\nKampong  Empat  Industrial Estate and  the  Tanglin\r\n\r\nHalt  Industrial Estate. They include several types\r\n\r\nof  factory  buildings, such as blocks  of  flatted\r\n\r\nfactories,   box-beam   type   temporary    factory\r\n\r\nbuildings,  terrace type factories and so  on.  The\r\n\r\nfigures  I give do not include factories which  are\r\n\r\nbeing  built  by the industrialists  themselves  in\r\n\r\nJurong and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these activities reflect the growth of our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing industries, particularly the  pioneer\r\n\r\nfirms.  As at June this year, there was an increase\r\n\r\nof pioneer firms in production from 97 last year to\r\n\r\n126,  an  increase of 30 per cent. Total investment\r\n\r\nin  fixed  assets increased from $293 million  last\r\n\r\nyear  to $336 million this year, an increase of  25\r\n\r\nper  cent. The number of persons employed increased\r\n\r\nduring  the  same period from 11,000 to 13,400,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of 22 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards trade with South Vietnam, this has\r\n\r\nbeen  helpful  but  the extent  has  probably  been\r\n\r\nexaggerated  by people who look only at  the  gross\r\n\r\nfigures. Five years ago, before the increase in the\r\n\r\nAmerican  military  effort in  South  Vietnam,  our\r\n\r\nexports to that country were in the region  of  $50\r\n\r\nmillion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  $60  million a year. In 1965 this increased  to\r\n\r\n$110 million, going to $256 million last year. This\r\n\r\nyear  it  is  running  at the rate  of  about  $300\r\n\r\nmillion  a  year.  However, most  of  the  products\r\n\r\nexported  to  Vietnam  consist  of  petroleum   and\r\n\r\npetroleum products. While these no doubt have  been\r\n\r\nuseful   to   our  refineries  and  to   businesses\r\n\r\nconnected  with  tanker  operations,  the  benefits\r\n\r\naccruing  to our manufacturing industries are  much\r\n\r\nless.  For  instance, in 1966, 80 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nexports  were  petroleum products  and  exports  of\r\n\r\nother  manufactures  amounted  to  only  some   $50\r\n\r\nmillion - a useful sum, no doubt, but not one  which\r\n\r\ncan  explain  the rate of our economic growth;  nor\r\n\r\nshould it place our industry in severe difficulties\r\n\r\nshould the war there come to a close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is gratifying to note the sturdy growth\r\n\r\nof  our  economy  and  its present  rather  healthy\r\n\r\ncondition,  our  future prospects can  give  us  no\r\n\r\ncause for complacency. Everybody knows that we  are\r\n\r\nnow  faced with a severe challenge to our  economic\r\n\r\nprosperity,  when  the British  plan  for  reducing\r\n\r\ntheir military forces in Singapore gets under  way.\r\n\r\nThe   programme   is  to  reduce   their   military\r\n\r\nestablishment by half by 1970/71. Concurrently with\r\n\r\nthe  run-down of the military establishment,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  corresponding reductions in the  civilian\r\n\r\nestablishments which provide supporting services to\r\n\r\nthe  fighting units. By 1970/71 the extent of  the\r\n\r\nrun-down,  so  far as Singapore is concerned,  will\r\n\r\nmean  a  reduction of half of the  31,500  locally-enlisted  personnel and locally-recruited civilians\r\n\r\nnow  employed in British bases. In other words,  by\r\n\r\nApril  1971,  there  will be  approximately  16,000\r\n\r\npeople  now  working in British bases who  will  be\r\n\r\nretrenched.  A  quarter of these  are  non-citizens\r\n\r\ncoming  from Malaysia and India, and the rest  will\r\n\r\nbe  Singapore citizens for whose welfare we have  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  The Government is preparing  plans\r\n\r\nwhereby  discharged civilians who are  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  may  be  re-absorbed into  industry  - if\r\n\r\nnecessary, after a period of industrial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraining. These details will doubtless be announced\r\n\r\nin due course by the Minister for Labour and I will\r\n\r\nnot encroach on his territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the economic effects are concerned, the\r\n\r\nBritish  military run-down will mean  not  only  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the number of unemployed  persons  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   but   also  a   reduction   of   local\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  Undoubtedly  these  effects  on   the\r\n\r\neconomy will be severe and protracted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary that we should quantify these\r\n\r\neffects  as  precisely as we can. On the  basis  of\r\n\r\nthis numerical assessment, we would be able to have\r\n\r\nan  accurate idea of the magnitude of the  counter-measures  that we have to take to counteract  these\r\n\r\neffects.  A lot of this work will be possible  only\r\n\r\nwhen the detailed plans of the force reduction  are\r\n\r\nknown.   Also,   the  counter-measures   that   are\r\n\r\navailable to us must include the productive use  of\r\n\r\nbase  facilities  when they  are  released  by  the\r\n\r\nBritish. A special unit has been established in the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister's  Department  to  go  into  these\r\n\r\ndetails.  What  I need to do here  is  to  give  an\r\n\r\nindication  of the order of magnitude involved  and\r\n\r\nthe  terms of the general policy which we  have  to\r\n\r\nevolve and implement to cushion off the effects  of\r\n\r\nthe  military  run-down from unduly  upsetting  our\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences of the military reduction can be\r\n\r\nviewed   from  two  angles.  First,  in  terms   of\r\n\r\nreduction  of  local expenditure which  these  base\r\n\r\nfacilities   generate.  This  includes   not   only\r\n\r\npayments to civilian and locally-enlisted personnel\r\n\r\nbut  also expenditure by British military personnel\r\n\r\nand  their  families, and expenditure  by  military\r\n\r\nforces   on   local   goods  and   services;   such\r\n\r\nexpenditure  has been running at the rate  of  $281\r\n\r\nmillion in 1961 and increasing to $450 million last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that in 1966 the total local\r\n\r\nexpenditure of the British military forces amounted\r\n\r\nto  no  less than 14 per cent of our gross domestic\r\n\r\nexpenditure. If we can assume that this expenditure\r\n\r\nwill be halved by April 1971, that is, three and  a\r\n\r\nhalf years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom now, this will mean a cumulative reduction  of\r\n\r\ntwo per cent of our gross domestic expenditure each\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already given figures of the expected\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  civilian and uniformed  employees  who\r\n\r\nwill  be  discharged  in the  first  phase  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  run-down. Roughly, this will mean that  we\r\n\r\nhave to find some 12,000 additional jobs if we want\r\n\r\nto  re-employ  all our citizens discharged  by  the\r\n\r\nBritish. If we assume that the rate of discharge is\r\n\r\nevenly  spread  throughout the  three  and  a  half\r\n\r\nyears, this will mean an additional 3,400 jobs each\r\n\r\nyear. We are thus faced with a substantial increase\r\n\r\nin  the  number of persons unemployed while at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  there will be a reduction  in  spending\r\n\r\nwhich,  unless balanced by additional  spending  in\r\n\r\nother  sectors of the economy, will not create  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  favouring the growth of  economy  to\r\n\r\nabsorb retrenched base workers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to deal with the subject of unemployment\r\n\r\nin  some  detail. This has always been the  central\r\n\r\neconomic problem of Singapore and the military run-down will obviously make it even more acute than it\r\n\r\nhad  been  during the last several years.  I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  like  to  discuss in  some  detail  this\r\n\r\nproblem   as   there  appears  to   be   widespread\r\n\r\nmisconception  about  the  extent  and  nature   of\r\n\r\nunemployment  in  Singapore. There  have  been  two\r\n\r\nexcellent  studies on the subject  made  last  year\r\n\r\nwhich  had  received  inadequate  attention.  These\r\n\r\nstudies  are the Government tabulation of  National\r\n\r\nRegistration identity cards made last year when the\r\n\r\nold  cards were exchanged for new cards. There  was\r\n\r\nalso  an excellent piece of research undertaken  by\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Research Centre of the University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  which  carried out a  very  large  scale\r\n\r\nsample survey of households in Singapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the analysis of unemployment was made in\r\n\r\nthese two studies, the only current source of data\r\n\r\nwas  the  registration records  maintained  by  the\r\n\r\nLabour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExchanges  of the Ministry of Labour.  Anybody  who\r\n\r\nwants  a  job registers his name there. He  may  be\r\n\r\nunemployed or he may be working and in search of  a\r\n\r\nbetter  job.  Since registration is not compulsory,\r\n\r\nnor  does it carry with it cash benefits by way  of\r\n\r\nsocial security payments, there is no inducement to\r\n\r\nregister apart from the hope of getting a job,  and\r\n\r\nthere  must be many unemployed people who  did  not\r\n\r\nregister.  So  the figures reported by  the  Labour\r\n\r\nExchanges  must be taken as uncertain as  to  their\r\n\r\nexact   meaning.   Provided,  however,   that   the\r\n\r\ndifferent  biases  entering into  the  figures  are\r\n\r\nconstant  from  year to year, then changes  in  the\r\n\r\nlevel of Labour Exchange registrations may be taken\r\n\r\nas  an  indication  of  changes  in  the  trend  of\r\n\r\nunemployment.  But even this is  a  risky  exercise\r\n\r\nonly to be undertaken as a last resort for want  of\r\n\r\nanything better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sample Household Survey carried out by the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore Economic Research  Centre\r\n\r\nenquires  of  all  economically active  persons  10\r\n\r\nyears or over what they are doing. It considers any\r\n\r\npersons unemployed if he or she is not working  and\r\n\r\nis   actively  looking  for  work.  The  number  of\r\n\r\nunemployed  estimated  in the  Survey  amounted  to\r\n\r\n52,630  as  compared with a working  population  of\r\n\r\n524,025. This gives an unemployment rate of 9.1 per\r\n\r\ncent. A count of identity cards gives the number of\r\n\r\nunemployed  as 43,405 against a working  population\r\n\r\nof 541,758 - an unemployment rate of 7.4 per cent.  I\r\n\r\nhave  circulated to Members of the  House  a  table\r\n\r\nsetting  out the findings of these two studies  and\r\n\r\nwould  ask  Members to refer to this  table  marked\r\n\r\nAppendix \"A\"* (* See cols. 503-4.). The differences in \r\n\r\nthe two estimates are  no  doubt the result of \r\n\r\ndifferent definitions,methods of enumeration and \r\n\r\nother technical factors.But  whichever  figure we \r\n\r\ntake, the  rate  is  very high,  though not as high \r\n\r\nas the estimates made  by some  alarmists. A closer \r\n\r\nstudy of the  composition of unemployed persons reveals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1967/19671205/19671205-HA-0260503.pdf\"\">Appendix \"A\" to Annual Budget Statement(Col.448) (Cols 0503-0504)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertain  interesting  features.  Both  the   Sample\r\n\r\nHousehold Survey and the National Registration data\r\n\r\nare  agreed that the majority of unemployed persons\r\n\r\nwere those who never previously worked and who were\r\n\r\nlooking   for   their  first  job.   The   National\r\n\r\nRegistration data estimate this group at 28,826, or\r\n\r\n66  per  cent of all unemployed persons. The Sample\r\n\r\nHousehold Survey estimates it at 28,789, or 54  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the total unemployed. Both are agreed that\r\n\r\nthe  majority of those unemployed persons who  were\r\n\r\nlooking for work for the first time were teenagers.\r\n\r\nThis   is  what  one  would  expect.  The  National\r\n\r\nRegistration  data  give the number  of  unemployed\r\n\r\npersons looking for their first job aged between 12\r\n\r\nand 19 years as 21,937. The Sample Household Survey\r\n\r\nplaces the figure at 18,545.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas the majority of those looking for their\r\n\r\nfirst  job were teenagers, the majority of  persons\r\n\r\nunemployed  who had previously worked were  persons\r\n\r\naged  20  or over. Of the 14,579 unemployed persons\r\n\r\nwho  became  unemployed  by losing  their  previous\r\n\r\njobs,  only  2,813 were teenagers and the  rest  20\r\n\r\nyears  or  older.  Very much the same  distribution\r\n\r\nappears  in  the  Sample  Household  Survey   data,\r\n\r\nalthough   the  figures  of  persons   who   became\r\n\r\nunemployed by losing their jobs, as contrasted with\r\n\r\nthose looking for their first job, are considerably\r\n\r\nlarger  in the Sample Household Survey. It  is  not\r\n\r\neasy  to reconcile these two sets of figures. I  am\r\n\r\ninclined  to  believe  that  the  Sample  Household\r\n\r\nSurvey  data  are  more  reliable.  The  method  of\r\n\r\nenumeration  by trained interviewers is  likely  to\r\n\r\nproduce   less   recording  errors.  The   National\r\n\r\nRegistration  data  were  compiled  by   relatively\r\n\r\nuntrained clerks, and recording mistakes could be a\r\n\r\nserious  source  of error. All this strengthens  my\r\n\r\nbelief  that  there  should be established  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  machinery  a system  for  the  periodic\r\n\r\nestimation  of the number of unemployed persons  by\r\n\r\nsome  reliable statistical method. This is the  one\r\n\r\nkey economic variable in Singapore and yet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  cannot  be  known  with  any  certainty  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the absence of a machinery to  collect\r\n\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go back to the studies, 21,900 teenagers\r\n\r\nlooking  for work is not suck a horrifying  problem\r\n\r\nconsidering  that  each year  some  40,000  persons - boys  and  girls  - reach the age  where  they  can\r\n\r\nreasonably  be  expected to earn a livelihood.  But\r\n\r\nthe  number  of people unemployed as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nlosing their jobs - 14,600 according to the National\r\n\r\nRegistration  data  and  23,900  according  to  the\r\n\r\nSample   Household  Survey  data   - these   numbers\r\n\r\nconstitute  a very serious problem. Most  of  these\r\n\r\npeople  are of the age where they could be expected\r\n\r\nto be supporting families. The number comes to some\r\n\r\n10,000  in  the National Registration data  and  no\r\n\r\nless  than  19,000  in the Sample Household  Survey\r\n\r\ndata.  While  we  can  expect  teenagers  to  spend\r\n\r\nanother  year  or  two living with  their  families\r\n\r\nwithout experiencing undue hardship, the older ones\r\n\r\nwho  have  lost  their jobs and are trying  to  get\r\n\r\nanother  create  both  an  economic  and  a  social\r\n\r\nproblem  of some importance. As I have said before,\r\n\r\ntheir ranks will soon be swollen very substantially\r\n\r\nby  those who would be retrenched from the military\r\n\r\nbases.  If  we  regard the Sample Household  Survey\r\n\r\nfigures  as  the more reliable one, in addition  to\r\n\r\nthe  19,000 adult persons unemployed in 1966, there\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  further 16,000 persons now working  in\r\n\r\nmilitary establishments who will be thrown  out  of\r\n\r\njob  in  the  next three and a half years.  So,  in\r\n\r\naddition to teenagers who are looking for  work  in\r\n\r\nincreasing numbers each year, we are faced  with  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  increase in the number  of  unemployed\r\n\r\npersons  with family responsibilities. We  have  to\r\n\r\ntry  to  provide them with a livelihood. To sum  up\r\n\r\nthe  figures, we have 12,000 Singapore citizens who\r\n\r\nwill  lose  their jobs in military bases  over  the\r\n\r\nnext three and a half years. This is to be added to\r\n\r\nsome  52,000  already unemployed. A further  25,000\r\n\r\nmust  be  added  each year, representing  teenagers\r\n\r\nentering  the labour market. This is the magnitude of the problem we have to solve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pose the problem in summary form, what we have\r\n\r\nto do in the next three years is -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) generate an additional $80 million\r\n\r\nexpenditure each year to offset the  reduction\r\n\r\nof British military expenditure;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) create 18,000 additional jobs a year to\r\n\r\nabsorb  those  who are now unemployed  and  to\r\n\r\nprovide  work for base employees  expected  to\r\n\r\nbe retrenched;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) create a further 25,000 new jobs each year\r\n\r\nfor  the  teenagers coming of age and  looking\r\n\r\nfor work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Can we do this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer these questions with any degree of\r\n\r\ncompleteness,  I think it is necessary  to  make  a\r\n\r\nreview  of our performance over the last ten years.\r\n\r\nMembers know that the prime objective of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment since 1959 has been to create  new  jobs\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore's growing population. So in a sense,\r\n\r\nwhat  we are faced with now is not so much a  novel\r\n\r\nsituation but an aggravation of an existing one.  A\r\n\r\nreview  of  our  performance over the  years  might\r\n\r\nyield   some   insight   as   to   what   practical\r\n\r\npossibilities  exist  for successfully  surmounting\r\n\r\nthe very grave difficulties that lie ahead for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1961, we have embarked on a major attempt\r\n\r\nto  industrialise the economy and there  have  been\r\n\r\nvisible changes in the shape of industrial estates,\r\n\r\nnew  factories which have given a concrete form  to\r\n\r\nour policy. It is possible, however, in our concern\r\n\r\nover  day-to-day  events, to  overlook  the  rather\r\n\r\nradical  changes  which  have  resulted  from  this\r\n\r\npolicy  in  the  structure of our economy.  I  have\r\n\r\ncirculated  a  simple Table (marked Appendix  \"B\"*)  (* See cols. 505-6.)\r\n\r\nwhich  sets  out  the distribution of  the  working\r\n\r\npopulation between the various industries  in  1957\r\n\r\nas  ascertained  by the Population Census  of  that\r\n\r\nyear and in 1966\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1967/19671205/19671205-HA-0260505.pdf\"\">Appendix \"B\" to Annual Budget Statement(Col.448) (Cols 0505-0506)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas ascertained in the Re-registration exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Registration data shown in this\r\n\r\ntable  show  a  very good degree of  correspondence\r\n\r\nwith the Household Survey and I therefore have  not\r\n\r\nused the latter data. The first feature that stands\r\n\r\nout is the very substantial reduction in the number\r\n\r\nof  persons occupied in agriculture and fishing. In\r\n\r\n1957, 31,500 were so engaged. The present number in\r\n\r\n1966, namely, 22,800, shows a substantial reduction\r\n\r\nof  more  than  a  quarter. The  reasons  for  this\r\n\r\ndecline must await closer investigation. All I  can\r\n\r\nsay   is  that  the  probable  causes  lie  in  the\r\n\r\nsubstantial decline in small-scale fishing  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  increasing  use of rural land for  residential\r\n\r\nand industrial purposes. The next important feature\r\n\r\nis  the  substantial  increase  in  the  number  of\r\n\r\npersons  engaged in manufacturing  from  68,000  to\r\n\r\n106,300, an increase of 56 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the number of persons engaged in\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing industries is confirmed  by  the\r\n\r\nannual  census  of manufactures.  This  covers  all\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industries engaging  10  persons  or\r\n\r\nmore.  It  therefore  excludes the  small  backyard\r\n\r\nenterprises which in Singapore account for  a  very\r\n\r\nsubstantial   number   of   persons   working    in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industries.  In  the  larger   firms\r\n\r\ncovered  by the census of manufactures, the figures\r\n\r\nrun as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre> \r\n\r\n                        1959      25,607\r\n\r\n                        1960      27,416\r\n\r\n                        1961      27,562\r\n\r\n                        1962      28,642\r\n\r\n                        1963      36,586\r\n\r\n                        1964      41,488\r\n\r\n                        1965      47,334\r\n\r\n                        1966      52,594\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures show that significant industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion  did not start until 1963 and since  then\r\n\r\nthere  has  been an annual net increase of  between\r\n\r\n5,000  and 6,000 jobs each year. This figure  takes\r\n\r\ninto  account  not  only the  additional  new  jobs\r\n\r\nprovided by new industries  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand expansion of old ones, but it also takes\r\n\r\ninto account jobs lost by contraction of industries\r\n\r\nor closing down of established firms for one reason\r\n\r\nor another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a sobering thought that with the\r\n\r\nprodigious  efforts we put in and the vast  amounts\r\n\r\nof  money  and  resources which the Government  had\r\n\r\nbeen  channelling towards increasing the growth  of\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing industries, all  that  bad  been\r\n\r\nachieved is a net increase of some 5,000 jobs  each\r\n\r\nyear  in  these industries. Clearly  this  rate  of\r\n\r\nincrease is inadequate to meet our future needs. It\r\n\r\nhas  not  even absorbed the increasing  numbers  of\r\n\r\nyoung  people  looking for jobs though,  no  doubt,\r\n\r\nwithout  the effort that was actually put  in,  the\r\n\r\nunemployment situation today may well  have  passed\r\n\r\nthe  critical point at which social discontent  may\r\n\r\nseriously   disrupt  all  prospects  of   political\r\n\r\nstability  and economic growth. This  element,  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  net  increases  in  jobs  in  the  larger\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industries, is a  critical  economic\r\n\r\nvariable, to which I will later return.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspects of this Table do not call for\r\n\r\nmuch comment. The increase in the number of persons\r\n\r\nengaged  in  construction is  substantial,  37  per\r\n\r\ncent,  and of course is the natural result  of  the\r\n\r\nlarge   building  programmes  under  way.  A   very\r\n\r\nnoteworthy feature is the number of persons engaged\r\n\r\nin trade which has virtually been stagnant over the\r\n\r\nlast 10 years, being 115,000 in 1957 and 116,800 in\r\n\r\n1966.  This  stagnation in the  number  of  persons\r\n\r\nengaged  in  commerce  is something  which  we  had\r\n\r\nexpected  when we came to office in  1959.  In  the\r\n\r\noutcome, our expectations appear to have been fully\r\n\r\nrealised.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have dealt with this subject in considerable\r\n\r\ndetail, taking into account the researches made  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  which have a bearing upon it, because  I\r\n\r\nwant   to  establish  beyond  all  doubt  that   to\r\n\r\ncounteract  the effects of military reductions  and\r\n\r\nto reduce the number of unemployed persons, we will\r\n\r\nhave literally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  redouble our present efforts, to  promote\r\n\r\nindustrial  growth.  First,  I  think  I  have  to\r\n\r\nestablish  that it is this sector of  the  economy,\r\n\r\nthe manufacturing industry, which lends itself most\r\n\r\neasily  to expansion as a consequence of deliberate\r\n\r\ngovernment policy. This is the experience not  only\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  but  also  in  most  under-developed\r\n\r\ncountries  which had attempted the same  policy  as\r\n\r\nours.  The second conclusion is that the  scale  of\r\n\r\nour  past  efforts  is quite insufficient  to  meet\r\n\r\nfuture challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then are we to do? What measures must we\r\n\r\ntake to bring about sufficient industrial growth to\r\n\r\nprovide not merely 5,000 new jobs a year but  twice\r\n\r\nor  even  three  times this figure?  A  preliminary\r\n\r\nquestion we have to dispose of before we go to  the\r\n\r\nmain issue is what other sectors of the economy can\r\n\r\nwe  hope to produce economic growth? We have  ruled\r\n\r\nout   the  trade  sector  and  we  have  seen  that\r\n\r\nagriculture is a declining occupation. Construction\r\n\r\nof  buildings is a good provider of jobs, but  this\r\n\r\nis  dependent on other sectors expanding to produce\r\n\r\na buoyant economy. In itself, the growth impetus of\r\n\r\nthe  construction industry will dry up as  soon  as\r\n\r\npeople who buy private housing run out of money  or\r\n\r\nwhen   the  development  funds  of  the  Government\r\n\r\ndiminish   because   economic  growth   cannot   be\r\n\r\nsustained.  Here, fortunately for  us,  Singapore's\r\n\r\nunique  geographical position once again  comes  to\r\n\r\nthe rescue. Our central position in South-East Asia\r\n\r\nhad  enabled us in the historical past to become  a\r\n\r\ntrading centre, which we still are. When trade  had\r\n\r\nbecome stagnant as a provider of employment, we had\r\n\r\nto  diversify our economy with useful  but  limited\r\n\r\nresults.   Now,   the   military   value   of   our\r\n\r\ngeographical situation, hitherto a large source  of\r\n\r\nemployment  and income, will be reduced in  stages.\r\n\r\nHowever,  a new factor emerges which, without  much\r\n\r\nmerit or great effort on our part, will come  as  a\r\n\r\nvery   welcome   element  generating   much   local\r\n\r\nexpenditure  and  providing  a  large   volume   of\r\n\r\nemployment. This is the tourist trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had earlier referred to the great influx of\r\n\r\ntourists  which  has  now  resulted  in  an   acute\r\n\r\nshortage  of  hotel accommodation. To  remedy  this\r\n\r\nshortage,  there are under construction five  large\r\n\r\nfirst-class  hotels  totalling  1,509  rooms.   The\r\n\r\ncapital  invested in these enterprises is estimated\r\n\r\nat  $45  million aid they should provide employment\r\n\r\nfor 2,500 when completed. A third of this new hotel\r\n\r\ncapacity will be completed next year, giving  us  a\r\n\r\nbadly needed additional 566 rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a large number of applications to\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Building Surveyor's Department  for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  more  new  hotels  or   for   the\r\n\r\nextension  of existing ones. Building approval  has\r\n\r\nalready  been  given to 16 new hotels or  extension\r\n\r\nprojects. These involve another 2,089 rooms with an\r\n\r\nemployment   potential   of   more   than    3,500.\r\n\r\nApplications  have also been received from  another\r\n\r\nnine  concerns for which building approval has  not\r\n\r\nyet  been  granted. These involve 1,240  additional\r\n\r\nrooms  with  a corresponding increase in employment\r\n\r\npotential. So over the next three and a half years,\r\n\r\nmost of these projects should have come to fruition\r\n\r\nand  they  will generate are additional 9,000  jobs\r\n\r\ndirectly  in  these  hotels  with  many   more   in\r\n\r\nassociated  tourist industries. Combined  together,\r\n\r\nthey  constitute a very welcome additional  impetus\r\n\r\nto our economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the aggregate, the newly created employment in\r\n\r\nthe  tourist  industry will  equal  in  volume  the\r\n\r\nnumber of citizens retrenched from the bases.  This\r\n\r\ndoes not mean, however, that the expected growth of\r\n\r\ntourism will completely offset the effects  of  the\r\n\r\nrun-down.   There   is   the  additional   indirect\r\n\r\nemployment created by the expenditure of servicemen\r\n\r\nand their families and of service departments which\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  allowed for.  All  the  same,  the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of tourism will provide, as  I  said,  a\r\n\r\nvery welcome relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I return to industrial growth which remains\r\n\r\nour  principal  weapon to provide more  income  and\r\n\r\nemployment.  Our policy in the past  has  been  to\r\n\r\nencourage  industries of any kind so long  as  they\r\n\r\nare  economically viable, that is to say, they  can\r\n\r\nmake  a  decent  return on capital invested.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  this,  we  have seen  a  miscellany  of\r\n\r\nfactories established in Singapore. This phase  - if\r\n\r\nI  can coin a phrase to describe it. \"the shoes and\r\n\r\nships  and  sealing wax\" phase of industrialisation - must   give   way   to   a  more   selective   and\r\n\r\ndiscriminating policy. This does not mean  that  we\r\n\r\nwould  not  support any proposal to  establish  any\r\n\r\nkind  of  plant in Singapore by a local or overseas\r\n\r\nindustrialist who is willing to put  in  the  money\r\n\r\nand  take the risk. All proposals are welcome,  but\r\n\r\nsome will be more welcome than others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new phase, it is necessary for the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   through  its  agency  of   industrial\r\n\r\npromotion, the Economic Development Board, to  make\r\n\r\na deliberate selection of those kinds of industries\r\n\r\nwhich  have  the greatest potential  for  long-term\r\n\r\ngrowth.   Every   economy   has   certain   natural\r\n\r\nadvantages  which are related to and are determined\r\n\r\nby  the  natural  resources that it possesses,  the\r\n\r\nsize  of  its  domestic market,  access  to  export\r\n\r\nmarkets  and other economic factors. In  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe  have no natural resources worth the mention and\r\n\r\nthe  domestic market is really too small upon which\r\n\r\nto  mount  the kind of industrial development  upon\r\n\r\nwhich  we must now embark. Obviously, we must  look\r\n\r\nto export markets, but here the difficulty is this.\r\n\r\nWhere  we  depend  on  capital  and  know-how  from\r\n\r\noverseas - as we now must for any industry that goes\r\n\r\nbeyond  a  certain  level  of  sophistication  - the\r\n\r\nquestion which the overseas industrialist will  ask\r\n\r\nof  himself, even if he is too polite to ask it  of\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Development  Board,  is  this,  \"Why\r\n\r\nshould I want to establish a plant in Singapore  to\r\n\r\nproduce for an export market in Europe, the  United\r\n\r\nStates or the Soviet Union? Why can't I do it  more\r\n\r\nsafely and more easily with the plant which  I  now\r\n\r\nhave, in my own country?\" There are specific\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstances - textiles, for instance - where there  are\r\n\r\ngood  reasons  why  overseas  enterprises  gain  by\r\n\r\nestablishing a factory in Singapore. In the case of\r\n\r\ntextiles,  there  was  a brief  escape  from  quota\r\n\r\nrestrictions   until  these  were   unceremoniously\r\n\r\nbanged  down  on  us  as well, but  in  general  no\r\n\r\nconvincing answer can be given to the question that\r\n\r\nI  posed,  unless we can create tangible incentives\r\n\r\nfor  exports.  The  award of  pioneer  certificates\r\n\r\ncarrying with it exemption from income tax for five\r\n\r\nyears  is  one such incentive. The specific  export\r\n\r\nincentives  incorporated in the  Bill  which  I  am\r\n\r\ntaking  through Parliament today will provide  even\r\n\r\nmore substantial benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But merely providing incentives would not produce\r\n\r\nthe  results that we want, unless it is  backed  by\r\n\r\nthe   right  policy  implemented  by  an  effective\r\n\r\nadministrative agency. In this second phase of  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme, it will  be  necessary\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  make  increasingly  large  outlays  on\r\n\r\nselected   growth  industries.  In  the   case   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the experts in the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard  and  I have independently come to  the  same\r\n\r\nconclusion, and that is that the growth  industries\r\n\r\nwhich  we must foster are the engineering and metal\r\n\r\nfabrication industries. These industries are labour\r\n\r\nintensive which, of course, is a decided advantage.\r\n\r\nFurther,  they  require  a  substantial  amount  of\r\n\r\nskills at all levels from the machinist working  on\r\n\r\nmachine tools to professional engineers with a wide\r\n\r\nrange  of  background  and training.  The  greatest\r\n\r\nasset,  however,  that  this  group  of  industries\r\n\r\npossess   lies  in  what  economists  call  \"inter-industry  linkages\". Firms in the  engineering  and\r\n\r\nmetal  fabrication industries buy a lot of products\r\n\r\nand  services  from each other. So an expansion  of\r\n\r\none  unit  or one branch increases the  market  for\r\n\r\nmany  others, allows them to lower costs by  making\r\n\r\npossible the purchase of more costly equipment  and\r\n\r\nto resort to better techniques used in larger scale\r\n\r\nproduction.  This built-in tendency  towards  self-reinforcing  growth  is one  which  marks  out  the\r\n\r\nengineering and metal fabrication\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustries as deserving of special attention.\r\n\r\nThe  products which these industries will turn  out\r\n\r\ncover  a very wide range of commodities, from ships\r\n\r\nto engines of various kinds powered by a variety of\r\n\r\nfuels to the making of different kinds of machinery\r\n\r\nand  components. There is a very substantial volume\r\n\r\nof international trade in these products and within\r\n\r\nthis  vast complex volume of international business\r\n\r\nin  engineering products, we should be able to find\r\n\r\nthat  mixture of products which we can  produce  on\r\n\r\nadvantageous and competitive terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a start, I have asked the Ishikawajima-Harima\r\n\r\nHeavy   Industries  of  Japan,  the  largest  ship-builders in the world, to make a technical study of\r\n\r\nthe   prospects   of  building  medium-size   ocean\r\n\r\nfreighters  in Jurong. Their team of engineers  and\r\n\r\nnaval  architects recently returned to Japan  after\r\n\r\nan   intensive  on-the-spot  study  of   production\r\n\r\nfacilities  in  Singapore which must support  ship-building  operations. Their recommendations  should\r\n\r\nbe made available to the Singapore Government early\r\n\r\nnext  year. The Economic Development Board are also\r\n\r\nconducting    feasibility   studies   into    other\r\n\r\nengineering  industries.  There  has  been  a  very\r\n\r\nsubstantial  expansion in the training and  service\r\n\r\nfacilities   for  the  engineering  industries   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  undertaken by the Service  Divisions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Development Board, and these will  be\r\n\r\nof  growing importance. Sometime next year, I  hope\r\n\r\nto  receive  from  the United  States  through  the\r\n\r\nassistance  of the International Executive  Service\r\n\r\nCorps  a  personal adviser on policies relating  to\r\n\r\nthe expansion of the engineering industries.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that technical and production problems\r\n\r\ncan   be  solved  provided  one  spends  sufficient\r\n\r\nresources  by  way of training, capital  investment\r\n\r\nand  supporting infra-structure facilities.  To  be\r\n\r\nsure,  this  is  going  to be a  vast  undertaking,\r\n\r\nlarger  than anything we have undertaken so far.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not imagine it would be the production problems\r\n\r\nthat  would  be the major difficulty.  We  have  an\r\n\r\nenergetic population which does not shirk work  and\r\n\r\nwhich  is  willing to put in arduous and  sustained\r\n\r\neffort  in  work,  in training and in  professional\r\n\r\nstudies. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill, of course, take much time to turn out a  wide\r\n\r\nrange of professional technical competence which we\r\n\r\nneed to man a sophisticated industry, and this must\r\n\r\nbe a long-term and continuing undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I believe that the real difficulty is not in\r\n\r\nproduction but in marketing. Of course, it is in  a\r\n\r\nsense   artificial  to  regard  these  aspects   as\r\n\r\nseparate   issues,   for  they   are   inextricably\r\n\r\nconnected. For instance, if your production  is  so\r\n\r\nefficient that you can undercut all competitors  in\r\n\r\nthe  world in producing a given product,  then  no\r\n\r\nmarketing problem exists, for you will be  able  to\r\n\r\nsell  all  that you produce. We cannot, of  course,\r\n\r\nassume  that  we  shall reach this happy  stage  of\r\n\r\nexcellence, for all that we can hope for is that we\r\n\r\nwould be roughly competitive `with other countries.\r\n\r\nIn  regard  to some aspects and some countries,  we\r\n\r\nmay  have  the  advantage of  higher  standards  of\r\n\r\neducation, more finance capital, easier  access  to\r\n\r\nexport markets, better communications, lower labour\r\n\r\ncosts   and  so  on.  In  regard  to  others,   the\r\n\r\nrelatively  low stage of our technical  development\r\n\r\nmust  be  a  severe  handicap  which  needs  to  be\r\n\r\novercome by exploiting our other advantages to  the\r\n\r\nfull.    On   balance,   an   efficient   marketing\r\n\r\norganisation  which will transmit  the  demand  for\r\n\r\nmachinery  components and engineering  products  in\r\n\r\ninternational trade to manufacturers in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  decided  advantage to  our  industrial\r\n\r\ngrowth.  By  this,  I  do not  mean  merely  export\r\n\r\npromotion  activities  which  governments  normally\r\n\r\nengage  in  and  which take the  form  of  overseas\r\n\r\nmarket    research,   special   products   display,\r\n\r\ndissemination of information, and so on. These  are\r\n\r\nnecessary but not sufficient. We must establish  in\r\n\r\nthe not too distant future an international trading\r\n\r\nagency   of  some  kind  which  will  relieve   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers in Singapore of many of the  problems\r\n\r\nconnected  with  the export of  their  products  to\r\n\r\noverseas  markets. This subject is  receiving  very\r\n\r\nclose  attention in my Ministry and in the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board, and I would say  no  more  than\r\n\r\nthat  the  implementation of this policy  may  well\r\n\r\nresult in far-reaching rearrangements in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstructure  and  pattern of our international  trade\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then are the problems we are facing. Many\r\n\r\nof  them, as I have said, are not new, but with the\r\n\r\nrun-down of the bases, they have acquired an  added\r\n\r\nurgency. I have outlined both the magnitude of  the\r\n\r\nproblem and the broad lines of policy upon which we\r\n\r\nhave   to  embark  in  attempting  a  solution   by\r\n\r\naccelerating  our industrial growth.  I  would  not\r\n\r\nlike  to be more specific than I have been, if  for\r\n\r\nno  other  reason  than that a great  deal  of  the\r\n\r\ndetails of policy will have to await closer  study.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, it is clear that the Government will\r\n\r\nhave  to put in more capital into industrial growth\r\n\r\nboth by way of direct investment as well as by  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of infra-structure services,  especially\r\n\r\nin  the shape of additional technological and  sub-professional training institutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Government investments in new\r\n\r\nindustrial  projects, the policy in  the  past  has\r\n\r\nbeen  one  of  prudence.  Obviously,  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board must make its calculations  with\r\n\r\nsome  accuracy before it invests in a new  venture,\r\n\r\nsince   it  cannot  risk  failure  in  its  initial\r\n\r\nattempts. The result has been that nearly  all  its\r\n\r\nequity  investments in industry have been extremely\r\n\r\nprofitable.  For  instance,  the  share  value   of\r\n\r\nNational  Iron  and  Steel,  in  which  it  has   a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  equity holding, has increased  to  two\r\n\r\nand  a  half  times  in  value.  Similarly,  Jurong\r\n\r\nShipyard, where the Economic Development Board owns\r\n\r\nnearly  half  the capital, is known  to  be  making\r\n\r\nlarge  sums  of money this year. I do  not  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  in  future  we  should be reckless  in  these\r\n\r\nmatters, for such an attitude is completely out  of\r\n\r\nplace  in responsible government. What I do suggest\r\n\r\nis  that  calculated risks must be taken where  the\r\n\r\npromise of growth makes this worth while. All  this\r\n\r\nmeans  that  substantially  larger  funds  must  be\r\n\r\nallocated  to building up our economic sinews  than\r\n\r\nhad  been  the case in the past, and it  cannot  be\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  Government has been  niggardly  in\r\n\r\nproviding  these funds. A whole host  of  questions\r\n\r\nfollows upon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  a  policy. For instance, will it be necessary\r\n\r\nto  create new financial institutions for the  more\r\n\r\neffective mobilisation of domestic capital? To what\r\n\r\nextent  can we look for useful assistance  from  or\r\n\r\nfruitful alliance with external sources of finance?\r\n\r\nThese  and  many other aspects of the  problem  are\r\n\r\nconstantly  exercising the minds of my  staff,  and\r\n\r\nthe   coming  months  should  see  some   important\r\n\r\ndevelopments in this field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go to discuss the estimates before\r\n\r\nParliament,  may I bring together the main  threads\r\n\r\nof the arguments which I have been developing? They\r\n\r\ncan be summarised under six main headings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The last 10 years have seen a marked change\r\n\r\nin  the structure of the economy of Singapore as  a\r\n\r\nresult of our policy on industrialisation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Industrial growth has managed to keep\r\n\r\nunemployment  within  manageable  proportions.   In\r\n\r\nspite  of rapid population growth, the increase  in\r\n\r\nunemployment has been from 29,600 in 1957 to 52,630\r\n\r\nin   1966.  Most  of  the  unemployed  persons  are\r\n\r\nteenagers  looking for their first  jobs.  However,\r\n\r\nthe seriousness of the present position must not be\r\n\r\nunder-estimated, for the present level of some  9.7\r\n\r\nper  cent of the work force is not very far removed\r\n\r\nfrom  the danger level where social discontent  may\r\n\r\nprovoke instability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Unemployment created by the reduction of\r\n\r\nBritish  Forces would present the Republic with  an\r\n\r\naggravation  of  an  already  serious  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The expected expansion of the tourist trade\r\n\r\nwill present the Republic with much needed relief.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) This will not, however, obviate the necessity\r\n\r\nfor intensified effort to produce faster industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion.  Such future efforts will  require  much\r\n\r\nlarger allocations of financial and other resources\r\n\r\nand  at  the same time the effort will have  to  be\r\n\r\nmore  selective in the choice of growth  industries\r\n\r\nto be encouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The additional effort will call for the establishment of new institutions in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  least  two fields, namely, the mobilisation  of\r\n\r\ndomestic   capital   and   the   exploitation    of\r\n\r\nopportunities in export markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments I turn to the Estimates that\r\n\r\nnow lie before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main point is that the considerations which I\r\n\r\nhave  discussed at such length and in  such  detail\r\n\r\nhave  placed certain constraints on the policy that\r\n\r\nhas to be followed in the allocation and raising of\r\n\r\nfunds for next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the detailed items of the accelerated\r\n\r\ngrowth policy which I have outlined have yet to  be\r\n\r\nworked  out into an operational programme,  it  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  possible to quantify actual requirements\r\n\r\nby  way of funds and resources. For this reason,  I\r\n\r\nhave  adopted what virtually amounts  to  a  normal\r\n\r\ncontinuation  budget with no major  innovations  or\r\n\r\nchanges  both  in  the Ordinary Estimates  and  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates. In the first place,  I  have\r\n\r\nnot  provided  in this Budget for  an  increase  in\r\n\r\ntaxes  next  year. So the Estimates of  Expenditure\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  framed within the expected  yield  of\r\n\r\nexisting taxes. Secondly, a large proportion of the\r\n\r\nadditional  revenue resulting from normal  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  will  have  to  be  allocated  for  Defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure. This is not the result of any increase\r\n\r\nin  our  Defence programme, but merely  the  normal\r\n\r\nimplementation of `the Defence Plan worked  out  in\r\n\r\nprevious  years. This point is of some  importance,\r\n\r\nand perhaps I may be allowed to elaborate on it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planned withdrawal of the British military\r\n\r\npresence  by the mid-70's has happily no effect  on\r\n\r\nour  Defence expenditure for next year. The  reason\r\n\r\nis that in framing the original Defence Plan of the\r\n\r\nRepublic,  some two years ago, one of  the  crucial\r\n\r\nelements which had to be taken into account was the\r\n\r\nprobable  duration of the British military presence\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  and in the region. We  came  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion in the Ministry of Defence that we could\r\n\r\nnot  depend  on the continued presence  of  British\r\n\r\nForces in this area beyond 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  the event, this planning assumption turned  out\r\n\r\nto  be  virtually  identical  with  the  intentions\r\n\r\nsubsequently  announced by the British  Government.\r\n\r\nSo provided there are no further changes of mind on\r\n\r\nthe  part of Her Majesty's Government, the build-up\r\n\r\nof  our  Defence  Forces on land will  continue  as\r\n\r\nplanned. The additional money provided for  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates is to pay for the implementation of  this\r\n\r\nPlan, now in its third year. As I had informed  the\r\n\r\nHouse  in  m previous capacity as Defence Minister,\r\n\r\nthe  Plan provided for the establishment of a total\r\n\r\nof seven Infantry Battalions which, with supporting\r\n\r\narms  and  services, would provide the elements  of\r\n\r\ntwo  infantry Brigades. In our estimate, this Force\r\n\r\nshould  be sufficient for our protection in  normal\r\n\r\ntimes.  I make this point lest the modest increases\r\n\r\nin   our   Defence  spending  occasion  unnecessary\r\n\r\nspeculation as to our intentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the practice not only in this\r\n\r\nParliament but also in those of other countries for\r\n\r\nFinance  Ministers to discuss in detail the  totals\r\n\r\nof   expenditures  under  the  various  heads   and\r\n\r\nsubheads  of the Budget and to discuss the expected\r\n\r\nyields of various items of revenue. In the past,  I\r\n\r\ntoo   have  taken  to  this  practice.  This  year,\r\n\r\nhowever, I intend to introduce an innovation by not\r\n\r\nentering into a statement of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that I have long suspected that\r\n\r\nnobody pays the slightest attention either in  this\r\n\r\nHouse   or  when  they  read  the  proceedings   in\r\n\r\ntomorrow's newspapers or in Hansard nobody pays the\r\n\r\nslightest  attention to the interminable series  of\r\n\r\nfigures involved in an exposition of this kind. The\r\n\r\naverage  human mind unfortunately does not  have  a\r\n\r\nhigh  degree of perceptivity in respect of numbers,\r\n\r\nand  I  am  afraid  that it is  the  misfortune  of\r\n\r\nFinance  Ministers in their Budget presentation  to\r\n\r\nlabour   under  the  misapprehension   that   their\r\n\r\naudiences  are eagerly and intelligently  digesting\r\n\r\nthe  outpouring of numerical data. I have  come  to\r\n\r\nthe conclusion that this is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na waste of time both on my part and on the part of\r\n\r\nhon.

This\r\n\r\nyear,  I  suggest that these matters of detail  are\r\n\r\nbest   dealt  with  in  Committee  stage   and   I,\r\n\r\ntherefore, propose to do no more than to allow  the\r\n\r\nfigures to speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main aggregates to take note of are that\r\n\r\nexpenditure  has been estimated at $646.4  million,\r\n\r\nand  revenue  at $646.7 million. Both represent  an\r\n\r\nincrease   of   $56.2  million  over  last   year's\r\n\r\nestimates. Since there is no increase in  taxation,\r\n\r\nthe  additional  revenue accruing to  the  Republic\r\n\r\nwill   be  the  result  of  economic  growth.

Today  the  number  of\r\n\r\npioneer  certificates issued stands at 243 and  the\r\n\r\nnumber of pioneer firms at 224. 155 of these  firms\r\n\r\nhave commenced production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our separation from Malaysia, which has put\r\n\r\na  seal  on the still-born Malaysian common market,\r\n\r\nit has become abundantly clear that only through  a\r\n\r\nrapid  increase in domestic exports of  traditional\r\n\r\nproducts in traditional markets as well as  of  new\r\n\r\nproducts  in new markets that Singapore can  attain\r\n\r\nsalvation. The first tentative steps were  made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government in late 1965 through a special  tax\r\n\r\ndeduction for export promotion activities. Then  in\r\n\r\nhis   Budget   speech  last  year,  my  predecessor\r\n\r\noutlined  a range of fiscal concessions on  profits\r\n\r\nderived  from  the export of domestic products.  It\r\n\r\nhas  taken us a full year, however, to grapple with\r\n\r\nthe  legal and administrative complexities of these\r\n\r\nproposals. I am, nevertheless, satisfied  that  the\r\n\r\ntime has been well spent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks, inter alia, to\r\n\r\nprovide   the   maximum  incentives  to   exporters\r\n\r\nwithout,  at the same time, allowing them too  much\r\n\r\nfat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn respect of old companies with established export\r\n\r\nmarkets,  it  is  only those who improve  on  their\r\n\r\nexport  record  who  will  benefit.  Exporters  who\r\n\r\nprefer  to rest on their oars will get nothing,  as\r\n\r\nbefits members of a thrusting and dynamic society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides export incentives, the Bill seeks to\r\n\r\noffer  tax  concessions  on  payments  for  foreign\r\n\r\nroyalties,  technical assistance and  research  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  as  well  as on interest  liabilities\r\n\r\narising   from  foreign  loans  utilised  for   the\r\n\r\npurchase of productive equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for a tax holiday in\r\n\r\nrespect   of   profits  from  sales   of   approved\r\n\r\nmanufactured  products resulting from an  expansion\r\n\r\nof approved enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill provides for the repeal and re-enactment with minor amendments of the well-known\r\n\r\nPioneer Industries Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I set out below details of each significant part\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II is essentially the same as the Pioneer\r\n\r\nindustries  Ordinance  of 1959.  Its  incorporation\r\n\r\ninto  the  present Bill is to place all  incentives\r\n\r\ntogether  in  one  piece of legislation  so  as  to\r\n\r\nassist investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III gives incentives to manufacturing\r\n\r\nenterprises which expand their productive capacity.\r\n\r\nAny  manufacturing company which incurs new capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for  the  purpose  of  manufacture  or\r\n\r\nincreased manufacture of an approved product may be\r\n\r\nentitled  to such benefit provided such expenditure\r\n\r\nexceeds $1 million, or exceeds $100,000 as well  as\r\n\r\nresults in an increase of not less than 30 per cent\r\n\r\nof the value of existing productive capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax concession which is computed on the basis\r\n\r\nof  a formula set out in clause 19 is available for\r\n\r\na  period of three or five years, depending on  the\r\n\r\namount of capital expenditure. The purpose of  this\r\n\r\nprovision  is  to encourage enterprises  to  expand\r\n\r\ntheir  capacity in order to improve their economies\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscale.  This is an important supplement to the  tax\r\n\r\nrelief for pioneer industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV provides tax relief for the export of\r\n\r\ndomestically  manufactured  products  and  deep-sea\r\n\r\nfish. The domestic market in Singapore is too small\r\n\r\nfor  many  manufacturing industries to achieve  the\r\n\r\noptimum   scale   of  production,   and   therefore\r\n\r\nproduction  for  export  is  necessary.   In   most\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries and in many of the  developed\r\n\r\ncountries, the domestic market is protected by high\r\n\r\ntariff  barriers  so  that domestic  consumers  may\r\n\r\nabsorb completely overhead costs while exports  are\r\n\r\npriced  at variable cost only. With a small  or  in\r\n\r\nsome  cases non-existent domestic market,  this  is\r\n\r\nnot   possible   in  Singapore.  It  follows   that\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  depends  very  largely  on   the\r\n\r\nincentives  given  to  the export  of  manufactured\r\n\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that profits of approved\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  companies from the export  of  their\r\n\r\nmanufactured  goods will be subject to  a  rate  of\r\n\r\ncompany tax of four per cent instead of the regular\r\n\r\ntax of 40 per cent. The same tax relief is given to\r\n\r\ncompanies engaged in deep-sea fishing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that separate cost accounting\r\n\r\nfor  exports and local sales is not practicable for\r\n\r\nmany   manufacturing  concerns.  Moreover,  it   is\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  the  Inland Revenue  Department  to\r\n\r\nassess   the  exact  export  profits.   The   Bill,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   adopts  a  simplified  formula   which\r\n\r\nassumes  that the rate of profit from export  sales\r\n\r\nand  domestic sales is the same. To the extent that\r\n\r\nactual profit is usually smaller than profits  from\r\n\r\ndomestic  sales, the simplified formula gives  some\r\n\r\nadditional  advantage  to exporters,  but  it  also\r\n\r\nsaves  a  lot of administrative work in the  Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue Department.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the present exports of manufactured goods\r\n\r\nother than those produced by pioneer industries are\r\n\r\nsubject  to  the  full 40 per  cent  tax,  the  tax\r\n\r\nincentive given to exports will somewhat lower  the\r\n\r\ntotal  revenue from company tax for the  first  few\r\n\r\nyears  after the adoption of the Act.  But  as  the\r\n\r\nincentive will encourage many more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industries  to  be  established   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  there  will  soon  be  an  increase  in\r\n\r\nemployment and income and eventually an increase in\r\n\r\ntax  revenue  from  all sources. Also,  as  exports\r\n\r\nincrease,  the  loss  of tax  revenue  from  export\r\n\r\nprofits will decrease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To aim at maximum market diversification and to\r\n\r\nreduce  partly  the loss of existing  revenue,  the\r\n\r\nBill  provides  that  in the case  of  established\r\n\r\nmarkets  for certain products, the tax relief  will\r\n\r\napply  only  to  the increase of exports  of  these\r\n\r\nproducts  to such markets. In order not  to  offset\r\n\r\ntoo greatly the export incentive, and to reduce the\r\n\r\nwork  of  tax  administration,  the  condition   of\r\n\r\nestablished markets will be applied only  to  cases\r\n\r\nwhere   a   given   product   has   been   exported\r\n\r\ncontinuously for a minimum period of five years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tax relief on export profits, a company\r\n\r\nqualifying  for  such  relief  shall  no  more   be\r\n\r\nentitled   to  the  double  reduction  of  overseas\r\n\r\nmarketing expenditure for tax purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V aims at reducing the cost of manufacturing\r\n\r\ncompanies which borrow from abroad for the purchase\r\n\r\nof  machinery  and  equipment.  Provided  that  the\r\n\r\namount  of the loan is not less than $200,000,  the\r\n\r\ninterest  on such approved foreign loans  shall  be\r\n\r\nexempt from tax, subject to the condition that such\r\n\r\nexemption  does  not  result  in  an  increase   in\r\n\r\nliability  to  tax  by the foreign  lender  in  his\r\n\r\ncountry  of  residence.  Since  tax  liability  has\r\n\r\nhitherto  been borne almost entirely by  the  local\r\n\r\nborrower, this concession will reduce the borrowing\r\n\r\ncosts  and  facilitate foreign loan  investment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing industries depend not only on\r\n\r\ncapital but also on techniques. Part VI of the  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides   that   approved   royalties,   technical\r\n\r\nassistance  fees and contributions to research  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment costs payable to non-residents shall be\r\n\r\ntaxed  at  20 per cent instead of the regular  non-resident  tax of 40 per cent. Such royalties,  fees\r\n\r\nor contributions, if used to acquire ordinary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshare  capital  in  the  company  from  which  such\r\n\r\npayments are received, shall be exempt from tax. In\r\n\r\nspecial  cases, the Minister may also  exempt  such\r\n\r\nroyalties, fees or contributions from tax  even  if\r\n\r\nthey  are not used to acquire share capital in  the\r\n\r\ncompany.  Tax  concessions on royalties,  fees  and\r\n\r\ncontributions  are given subject to  the  condition\r\n\r\nthat they do not result in an increase in liability\r\n\r\nto tax in the non-resident's country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VIII of the Bill relates to consequential\r\n\r\nmatters  such  as  repeal of  earlier  legislation,\r\n\r\ntransitional provisions, penalties and so  on.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  is  empowered  to  make  regulations  for\r\n\r\ncarrying out the provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I venture to suggest that this Bill, which\r\n\r\nconsolidates and expands our industrial incentives,\r\n\r\nheralds  a  new and bright phase in our  industrial\r\n\r\nprogress,  one  which  holds  out  hopes  that  our\r\n\r\nefforts   to  overcome  the  serious,  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem of our time will eventually succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I close with a word of assurance to our\r\n\r\nmanufacturers? I would have liked to send this Bill\r\n\r\nto  Select Committee if this course of action  were\r\n\r\nat  all  feasible. But it is necessary that  export\r\n\r\nincentives promised a year' ago become law now  and\r\n\r\nthis  rules  out consideration by Select Committee.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same  time,  I am conscious  that  further\r\n\r\nconsideration may bring about improvements and I am\r\n\r\nopen    to    suggestions   and   proposals    from\r\n\r\nmanufacturers and other interested parties,  which,\r\n\r\nif   they   are   of  sufficient  merit,   can   be\r\n\r\nincorporated in a future amending Act.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I speak in support of the Bill which,\r\n\r\nin  effect,  re-enacts the principal provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe  previous legislation governing the  industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of Singapore. As such,  the  Bill  not\r\n\r\nonly provides for the establishment of new pioneer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustries   and   for  expansion  of   established\r\n\r\nenterprises,  but  also  places  emphasis  on   the\r\n\r\nproduction  for  export.  This  is  a  Bill   which\r\n\r\neveryone   in  this  House  I  am  sure   supports.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I have some criticism to make against\r\n\r\nit.  It  is my regret that I do have some criticism\r\n\r\nto   make,   especially  since  this  Bill   is   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive   Bill   governing   the   industrial\r\n\r\npromotion of Singapore. I appreciate that  no  Bill\r\n\r\ncan  be  perfect in the sense that it provides  for\r\n\r\nall  possible eventualities or contingencies within\r\n\r\nthe scope of the Bill. I feel, however, that it  is\r\n\r\nmy duty to bring to the attention of this House the\r\n\r\nmain defect which I consider to be present in  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill, as stated in the Bill\r\n\r\nitself,  is  to  amend  and  consolidate  the  laws\r\n\r\nrelating  to  incentives for the  establishment  of\r\n\r\npioneer   industries  and  for  economic  expansion\r\n\r\ngenerally,  by way of providing relief from  income\r\n\r\ntax  and  so  on.  It  is about seven  years  since\r\n\r\nSingapore   embarked   on   its   industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme.  I am surprised that during this  period\r\n\r\nof seven years the various authorities, such as the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board which is responsible for\r\n\r\nthe   implementation   and   the   supervision   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's industrialisation programme,  have  not\r\n\r\nfound it necessary to incorporate into the relevant\r\n\r\nlegislation    covering    the    industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme   of  Singapore  a  distinction   between\r\n\r\ngenuine Singapore-based pioneer industries and non-genuine Singapore-based pioneer industries. From my\r\n\r\nexperience   as  the  Secretary  of   the   Pioneer\r\n\r\nIndustries Employers' Union, I regret to note  that\r\n\r\nthere are two such categories of pioneer industries\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  today. In the case  of  the  genuine\r\n\r\nSingapore-based pioneer industries which are set up\r\n\r\nby foreign investors with or without local capital,\r\n\r\nthe   pioneer   industrial   concerns   are   fully\r\n\r\ncontrolled   by  local  boards  of  directors   and\r\n\r\nestablish  for  themselves  their  own  network  of\r\n\r\nexport  markets.  In  the case of  the  non-genuine\r\n\r\nSingapore-based  pioneer industries  which  may  be\r\n\r\nsimilarly set up by foreign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestors  with  or  without  local  capital,   the\r\n\r\npioneer   industrial  concerns  mainly   serve   as\r\n\r\nadjuncts   to  the  overseas  industrial   concerns\r\n\r\nbelonging  to the foreign investors. The policy  of\r\n\r\nsuch  local industrial concerns is dictated through\r\n\r\nlocal  boards of directors with no effective power,\r\n\r\nbut  by  the foreign investors from their  overseas\r\n\r\nheadquarters.  To  give  an  example  by   way   of\r\n\r\nillustration, a Hongkong industrialist may set up a\r\n\r\nlocal  textile firm which avails itself  of  income\r\n\r\ntax relief under the relevant legislation. In spite\r\n\r\nof   the   stringent  provisions  in  the  relevant\r\n\r\nlegislation in respect of the valuation of  second-hand  machinery,  this Hongkong industrialist  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  immensely  from the disposal  of  obsolete\r\n\r\nmachinery from his Hongkong factory to the  pioneer\r\n\r\nfactory in Singapore. Secondly, the textile firm in\r\n\r\nSingapore, besides meeting the negligible demand of\r\n\r\nthe  local Singapore market, does not establish for\r\n\r\nitself  any  contact with any foreign  market.  Any\r\n\r\nexport to overseas markets is directed through  the\r\n\r\nHongkong   firm.  In  other  words,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nfactory  serves  as  a  \"relief\"  factory  for  the\r\n\r\nHongkong  textile concern in the sense that  it  is\r\n\r\nonly  when  the Hongkong firm is not able  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  orders from its overseas customers that  such\r\n\r\nsurplus  orders  are passed over to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nfactory. Such a textile factory, in my opinion,  is\r\n\r\nnot a genuine Singapore-based pioneer factory. As I\r\n\r\nsee it, the Singapore factory is fully dependent on\r\n\r\nits   Hongkong  principal  and  its   interest   is\r\n\r\nsubordinated  to  the  interest  of  the   Hongkong\r\n\r\ntextile  concern. It is not in the general interest\r\n\r\nof  Singapore to have such factories which  do  not\r\n\r\nactually  contribute to the industrial  development\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, because the principal  objective  of\r\n\r\nthe  establishment  of  any industrial  concern  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  to  establish for itself  an  export\r\n\r\nmarket and enhance the reputation of Singapore-made\r\n\r\ngoods. This is not being achieved by firms such  as\r\n\r\nthe  one  which  I  have  just  described,  because\r\n\r\nwhatever it is doing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly serves to strengthen the export market for the\r\n\r\nHongkong firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first concern is that such a firm is able to\r\n\r\nget  the  same relief from income tax and the  same\r\n\r\nbenefit as a genuine Singapore-based industry  gets\r\n\r\nunder   the  relevant  legislation  governing   the\r\n\r\nindustrial development of Singapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other concern, which is very important to me,\r\n\r\nis that the workers of Singapore receive a raw deal\r\n\r\nunder  the management of such a Singapore  factory.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  workers must comply with the  constant\r\n\r\nreiteration by the Singapore Government of the need\r\n\r\nnot  to  press  for  higher wage claims  and  other\r\n\r\nfringe  benefits  in  order to  allow  the  pioneer\r\n\r\nindustries  to  compete  effectively  in   overseas\r\n\r\nmarkets.  Secondly, the workers are not assured  of\r\n\r\nregular   employment  because  such  a  non-genuine\r\n\r\nSingapore-based factory has no market  of  its  own\r\n\r\nand   exists  only  as  a  factory  to   meet   the\r\n\r\nfluctuating  marginal demands or  contingencies  of\r\n\r\nthe   Hongkong   industrial  concern.   It   is   a\r\n\r\nregrettable state of affairs and I think it  is  of\r\n\r\nutmost   importance   for  Singapore's   industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment to make a distinction between  the  two\r\n\r\ntypes  of  pioneer industries in order to encourage\r\n\r\nthe   genuine  and  not  the  apparent   industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my only comment on this Bill, but it does\r\n\r\nnot  in any way detract from my support for  it.  I\r\n\r\nonly  wish  that the House will take notice  of  my\r\n\r\ncomments  and pay some attention to the  resolution\r\n\r\nof   the   problem  of  encouraging   the   genuine\r\n\r\nindustrial development of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Expansion  Incentives  (Relief  from\r\n\r\nIncome Tax) Bill seeks to provide additional relief\r\n\r\nfrom  taxation  for enterprises whose  creation  or\r\n\r\nexpansion  of exports are in the economic interests\r\n\r\nof the State. This Bill consolidates, re-enacts and\r\n\r\nrepeals the Pioneer Industries (Relief from Income\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTax) Ordinance of 1959 and the Industrial Expansion\r\n\r\n(Relief  from Income Tax) Ordinance, also of  1959.\r\n\r\nAs  such, any criticism of this Bill will, I think,\r\n\r\nbe  found in what it does not contain than what  it\r\n\r\ndoes.   It   merely   consolidates   two   previous\r\n\r\nOrdinances and grants additional tax relief, but it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  nor is it designed to change  the  basic\r\n\r\ncharacter  of tax legislation. I believe that  what\r\n\r\nis   urgently  required  is  a  comprehensive   re-examination  of  the fundamentals of  our  taxation\r\n\r\nstructure  and system. After all, this  Bill  seeks\r\n\r\nonly to supplement the income Tax Ordinance, and if\r\n\r\nwhat  it seeks to supplement is not the best,  then\r\n\r\nthe  best  it can do cannot be the best.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, it is circumscribed from the start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, of course, a highly controversial matter\r\n\r\nas  to  whether or not our present taxation  system\r\n\r\nand  structure retards economic growth. There  does\r\n\r\nnot seem to be any controversy. Indeed, it seems to\r\n\r\nbe  taken for granted by almost everybody that  our\r\n\r\ntax system is not conducive to economic growth.  If\r\n\r\nthis  is  the  situation, that is,  where  everyone\r\n\r\nagrees  that  it  is  not good and  disagrees  only\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is bad, then I say that the  time  has\r\n\r\ncome  when serious thinking should be done  on  its\r\n\r\nchange.  There  will  be  the  traditionalists  who\r\n\r\nregard  any  change with horror and who rest  their\r\n\r\ncase  on  custom  and  usage  -the  solid  base  of\r\n\r\ninertia. On the other hand, there will be those who\r\n\r\nbelieve  that a revision of our present tax  system\r\n\r\nsolves  all  problems  associated  with  industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion.  The  truth  probably  lies,  as   truth\r\n\r\nusually does, somewhere in between. It is here that\r\n\r\nI  think the Government can profitably explore. The\r\n\r\nprocess will probably take at least a year  or  two\r\n\r\nbefore  the  truth  is  found  and  implemented.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest   that   a   Commission   with   as    wide\r\n\r\nrepresentation  as possible be appointed  forthwith\r\n\r\nto  review the principles and administration of our\r\n\r\npresent tax system and to make recommendations  for\r\n\r\nchanges.

In our need for  rapid  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  we should not ignore an aspect  which\r\n\r\nplays  a  very important part in either stimulating\r\n\r\nor  retarding economic growth. I think everyone  in\r\n\r\nthis  House will agree with those outside that  our\r\n\r\nproperty  tax laws are rather archaic  and  require\r\n\r\nmodernisation. Property owners have been  heard  to\r\n\r\ncomplain rather bitterly -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Lim, I am afraid your\r\n\r\ncomments  on the Property Tax Ordinance are  rather\r\n\r\noutside the scope of the Bill under discussion. You\r\n\r\nwill be in order if you can relate your remarks  to\r\n\r\nincome  tax  problems connected with  property  tax\r\n\r\npaid  by industries or companies to which this Bill\r\n\r\nwill, when enacted, apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Sir, that is what I have in\r\n\r\nmind.  Property owners have been heard to  complain\r\n\r\nrather    bitterly    and    vociferously     about\r\n\r\ndiscrepancies   and  differences   in   rates   and\r\n\r\nvaluations that cannot be justified.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill before the House can at least\r\n\r\nsupplement  if not correct our present  income  tax\r\n\r\nsystem   by   offering  incentives  to  investments\r\n\r\nthrough  reliefs  from income tax. Such  incentives\r\n\r\ncan  at  best  be stop-gap temporary  measures  and\r\n\r\nshould  be examined in the light of possibly better\r\n\r\nthings  to  come.  All  the  reliefs  proposed  for\r\n\r\npioneer     industries,    expanding    established\r\n\r\nindustries  and  export industries relate  directly\r\n\r\nback  to  the rather old and cumbersome  method  of\r\n\r\nincome  taxation which asks incorporated  companies\r\n\r\nto  act as tax collecting agents for the Government\r\n\r\nin   the  case  of  distributed  profits,  and   as\r\n\r\ntaxpayers in the case of retained profits.  Such  a\r\n\r\nsystem has little philosophy, less rationale and no\r\n\r\nequity.  It  operates  this  way.  A  company  does\r\n\r\nbusiness for a year and makes a profit. It pays  40\r\n\r\nper cent of that profit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  tax, if it distributes that profit as dividends\r\n\r\nin  that  year, then its shareholders get  the  tax\r\n\r\ncredit  and adjust it against their personal  rates\r\n\r\nin  the  third year. On the other hand, the company\r\n\r\nmay  not  distribute  the profit  until  ten  years\r\n\r\nlater.  In this case, the shareholders will  adjust\r\n\r\ntheir tax credits in the twelfth year against their\r\n\r\npersonal rates. During this time, many shareholders\r\n\r\nmay   have   disposed  of  their  shares   to   new\r\n\r\nshareholders  who  have taken them  over.  The  old\r\n\r\nshareholder  would  have  sold  his  shares  at  an\r\n\r\nenhanced  price  incorporating the  profit  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany  and the tax credit. What is more is  that\r\n\r\nthe  profit  from the sale of the  shares  will  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as non-taxable capital gain and  the  new\r\n\r\nshareholder  in  reality  gets  back  part  of  his\r\n\r\ncapital   by  way  of  the  dividends  subsequently\r\n\r\ndeclared on which he has to pay tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from this that our present tax\r\n\r\nwithholding system upon which is based the  further\r\n\r\nreliefs proposed by this Bill before the House does\r\n\r\nnot   lend   itself  to  accurate  or  even   close\r\n\r\nestimation of the effects of the reliefs either  in\r\n\r\nquantum  or on the persons considered desirable  to\r\n\r\nenjoy them. It is widely held that one of the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  factors conducive to economic growth  is\r\n\r\nthe  presence  of large joint-stock companies  with\r\n\r\ncapital spread over a large number of shareholders.\r\n\r\nSuch   being   the  case,  it  is  important   that\r\n\r\nshareholders   should  shoulder  their   true   tax\r\n\r\nliabilities  or enjoy their true tax  reliefs.  Our\r\n\r\npresent tax structure does not provide this, and it\r\n\r\nfollows that the present Bill does not so provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not saying that we should\r\n\r\nnot  have the present Bill before us made into law.\r\n\r\nWhat  I do say is that we should not stop with  it.\r\n\r\nWe  should  only  regard it as a  stop-gap  measure\r\n\r\nwhile  we revise our present tax structure. I  say,\r\n\r\nlet  us try to make this Bill work in order to give\r\n\r\nus time to work out a better one, which, apart from\r\n\r\nease, certainty and fairness to the taxpayers, will\r\n\r\nat  least  enable  the Government to  estimate  its\r\n\r\nrevenue from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofits  made by the companies rather than  on  the\r\n\r\nprobable    time   and   quantity   of    dividends\r\n\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can go on, Sir, for quite some time on the\r\n\r\nmerits  of a corporation tax instead of our present\r\n\r\nwithholding tax. But as we are not debating a  Bill\r\n\r\nto  establish corporation tax, I should now like to\r\n\r\ndeal with the provisions of the present Bill, after\r\n\r\nhaving  established the point that  we  should  not\r\n\r\nexpect too much from it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (9) of clause 14 is held by many as\r\n\r\nunduly  restrictive. This sub-clause restricts  the\r\n\r\ncarry-through    tax    exemption    benefits    to\r\n\r\nshareholders  of  a holding company  to  one  which\r\n\r\nholds throughout the tax relief period of a pioneer\r\n\r\ncompany  either  all  the  issued  shares  or  such\r\n\r\nportion  of the shares as the Finance Minister  may\r\n\r\nrequire at the time when the pioneer certificate is\r\n\r\nissued  to the pioneer company. I do not think  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  be  an  unreasonable  man  when  he\r\n\r\ndetermines  the  portion  of  pioneer  shares   the\r\n\r\nholding company should have. But the Bill does  not\r\n\r\nallow  him  to change his mind should  the  holding\r\n\r\ncompany,  for one reason or another, all  good  and\r\n\r\nvalid  reasons, wishes to change its shareholdings.\r\n\r\nUnless the Minister can give cogent reasons  why  a\r\n\r\nholding  company should not vary its  shareholdings\r\n\r\nat  all,  I am of the view that he should at  least\r\n\r\narm  himself  with  the  powers  to  agree  to   a\r\n\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (5) of clause 19 does not appear to be\r\n\r\na  favourable incentive to expanding enterprises in\r\n\r\nthat  its terms are rather restrictive. It must  be\r\n\r\nborne  in  mind  that we are a young industrialised\r\n\r\ncountry  and  cannot  compare  with  those   highly\r\n\r\nindustrialised  countries in  other  parts  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  Practically every country in this  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  world  is  competing against one  another  for\r\n\r\ninvestment. In the face of such competition. I feel\r\n\r\nwe  should  give serious consideration to affording\r\n\r\nrelief  by way of investment allowances which  have\r\n\r\nbeen   found  to  be  a  more  practical  form   of\r\n\r\ninducement to investment. If it is found  advisable\r\n\r\nto adopt the investment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallowance method as an incentive, clause  17,\r\n\r\nespecially  sub-clause (1) (a) and (b) ,  will  need\r\n\r\nrevision either in principle or in quantum,  or  in\r\n\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many manufacturers are apprehensive of the\r\n\r\npossible administrative difficulties in the use  of\r\n\r\nthe words \"established export market\" contained  in\r\n\r\nPart IV of the Bill. Such a fear may or may not  be\r\n\r\njustified depending not on the legislation  but  on\r\n\r\nthe  attitude  of the tax authorities  implementing\r\n\r\nthe legislation. Not being a legal man, I am not in\r\n\r\na  position to propose the necessary amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, but I should like the Minister to narrow\r\n\r\ndown  the  possibilities of lengthy  and  fruitless\r\n\r\narguments between taxpayer and tax collector.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another dissatisfaction from manufacturers,\r\n\r\nespecially from the established ones, is  that  the\r\n\r\nincentives  proposed give more to the new  exporter\r\n\r\nand  discriminate against the old exporters.  Here,\r\n\r\nwe  are  dealing with a Bill which seeks to  induce\r\n\r\nnew  exporters,  and there is much to  justify  the\r\n\r\nphilosophy of not running after the bus when it  is\r\n\r\nalready  caught.  But the sour note  introduced  by\r\n\r\ndifferential  treatment may either  cause  friction\r\n\r\namongst  manufacturers or induce old  manufacturers\r\n\r\nto   create  subsidiary  companies  ostensibly   to\r\n\r\nmanufacture  those products that  are  exported  or\r\n\r\nexport  to new markets for the purpose of re-export\r\n\r\nto  the  established markets. If the Minister  does\r\n\r\nnot wish to change his mind on not running after  a\r\n\r\ncaught  bus,  I  feel he should  examine  the  many\r\n\r\npossible ways of tax avoidance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts V and VI of the Bill operate largely around\r\n\r\nthe key words \"bona fides\". Everyone knows that  it\r\n\r\nis  extremely difficult to determine bona fides  in\r\n\r\nthe business world. There are so many forms and  so\r\n\r\nmany  disguises.  I  know  that  it  is  even  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  legislate on what  constitutes  bona\r\n\r\nfides,  but  I should like the Minister  to  assist\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  exporters with some  general  guide-lines,  so  that  those wanting  foreign  loans  or\r\n\r\nforeign  technical assistance are  better  able  to\r\n\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with these reservations, I\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I wonder if the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Telok  Blangah has really thought out  to  its\r\n\r\nlogical conclusion the statement he has made  about\r\n\r\nHongkong industrialists who establish ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I only said, as  an  illustration,\r\n\r\nHongkong industrialists.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nevertheless, he has given us\r\n\r\nto  understand that these are the people. The point\r\n\r\nis this: is he suggesting that if Hongkong or other\r\n\r\nindustrialists  want to establish a  subsidiary  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  which can provide useful employment  for\r\n\r\nour   unemployed,   we  should  turn   down   their\r\n\r\napplications? Is that his proposition? I  doubt  if\r\n\r\nhe  means that. I think his main objection  is  the\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which  some  of these  enterprises  are\r\n\r\ncarried  on,  namely, that work is irregular,  that\r\n\r\nworkers  are  laid off from time  to  time.  May  I\r\n\r\nsuggest to him that this does not really depend  on\r\n\r\nwhether  the  local  plant is  a  subsidiary  of  a\r\n\r\nforeign firm, or whether it is run by a local board\r\n\r\nof  directors,  irregular demand is the  result  of\r\n\r\nirregular market conditions, and whether  you  have\r\n\r\none  form  of enterprise as against the  other,  so\r\n\r\nlong  as  market  conditions  are  erratic,  it  is\r\n\r\nunavoidable  that  you  get  irregular  periods  of\r\n\r\nemployment.  This is true not only in  the  textile\r\n\r\nindustry  but  also generally in  other  industries\r\n\r\nsubject  to  very wide fluctuations in  the  export\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have thought that one of the great merits\r\n\r\nof  Hongkong industrialists is that they  not  only\r\n\r\nbring   their   capital  and  their   know-how   to\r\n\r\nSingapore, but they also bring their export market.\r\n\r\nIt  is  all  very  well to say that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nmanagement  can  develop export markets  which  are\r\n\r\nmore  steady and more reliable. There are very  few\r\n\r\nSingapore manufacturers with much experience in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noverseas export markets. And the great contribution\r\n\r\nthat Hongkong industrialists have made to Singapore\r\n\r\nis  that  this  problem of marketing  is  virtually\r\n\r\nsolved  by them. Of course, I would agree  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be a good thing if there could be a  greater\r\n\r\ncontinuity  of  employment. No  one  would  dispute\r\n\r\nthat.  But, unfortunately, continuity of employment\r\n\r\nsometimes depends on factors outside the control of\r\n\r\nthe enterprise in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Telok Blangah is confusing\r\n\r\nthe  early days of the textile business when it  is\r\n\r\ntrue  that  Singapore firms were  using  quotas  or\r\n\r\nunused quotas of their Hongkong main companies. But\r\n\r\nthis  was  very  soon settled when  countries  like\r\n\r\nBritain  and  America  gave  separate  quotas   for\r\n\r\nSingapore   manufacturers.   As   soon   as    this\r\n\r\narrangement  came  into effect, the  production  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  plants was related to the quota  allowed\r\n\r\nfor the plants, and not related to the  quota\r\n\r\ngiven to the Hongkong principals.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the comments of the Member for\r\n\r\nHavelock. I think he has made a study of this Bill.\r\n\r\nHe  says that it does not introduce any fundamental\r\n\r\nchange  in  the  tax system of the  Government.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, this is true - this Bill is not intended  to\r\n\r\nintroduce any basic changes. It only makes  certain\r\n\r\nconcessions in order to promote industrial  growth.\r\n\r\nWhether   the  present  time  is  appropriate   for\r\n\r\ncommission of the tax system is a matter on which I\r\n\r\nthink  people can have different opinions.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  urged  upon me that our tax system  needs  an\r\n\r\noverhaul.  If so, this is a subject which  must  be\r\n\r\nconsidered on its own merits and not in relation to\r\n\r\nwhether  a better tax system would promote economic\r\n\r\nexpansion.  I would have thought that  one  of  the\r\n\r\nmain  objectives of having a better  tax  structure\r\n\r\nwould be the more efficient collection of revenue.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of export incentives, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Havelock  makes the point, which  has  already\r\n\r\nbeen put to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nme  by  other  people, that this Bill would  unduly\r\n\r\nfavour  the  new  industrialists  as  compared   to\r\n\r\nestablished  firms  with a long  record  of  export\r\n\r\nperformance. He suggests that this might tempt  the\r\n\r\nolder  industries  to  create  subsidiaries  or  to\r\n\r\ndisguise  themselves as separate legal entities  in\r\n\r\norder to obtain the benefits of tax exemption. I do\r\n\r\nnot  think this is possible because what determines\r\n\r\nwhether   a  particular  product  will  enjoy   tax\r\n\r\nexemption is not whether the firm producing  it  is\r\n\r\nnew  or  old. It is whether in the past such  goods\r\n\r\nhave  been  exported  in continuing  amounts  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain  established market, and  if  that  is  the\r\n\r\ncase,  then  neither the old firm  nor,  if  it  is\r\n\r\ndisguised as a new firm, it will get this  benefit.\r\n\r\nThe  only people who will get this benefit are  the\r\n\r\nold  firms  who  have improved  on  their  previous\r\n\r\nperformances,  and if it is a new firm,  then  they\r\n\r\nwill   have   to   improve  on   the   old   firm's\r\n\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the provision of bona fides in Part V\r\n\r\nof  this Bill, I would have thought that this is  a\r\n\r\nvery  simple  matter. This is  to  ensure  that  no\r\n\r\nfictitious  loans or transactions  are  created  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  exemption  from tax and  bona  fides  really\r\n\r\nmeans  that the transactions or the loans on  which\r\n\r\ntax  exemption is being asked for represent genuine\r\n\r\nbusiness transactions, subject, of course,  to  the\r\n\r\nminimum  limits  laid down in the  law.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nexpect that there would be much trouble about this.\r\n\r\nBut  if  this is a matter which still disturbs  the\r\n\r\nMember,  I  would be very glad if he could  let  me\r\n\r\nknow exactly what is causing him anxiety. There may\r\n\r\nbe  a  real  point which is causing  anxiety  among\r\n\r\nbusinessmen, in which case I would be very glad  to\r\n\r\ngive  any  further clarification on  this,  but  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  on rather concrete proposals.  I  think\r\n\r\nthese remarks would cover most of the points he has\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Clause 14, Dr Goh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I\r\n\r\nremember  on  this day last year I  spoke  in  this\r\n\r\nParliament  on  the  adjournment  on  \"Culture   in\r\n\r\nSingapore's  Nation-Building\". It  is  exactly  one\r\n\r\nyear  since that occasion. I also remember that  in\r\n\r\nthe  course  of that speech I proposed a  ten-point\r\n\r\nsuggestion relating to the question of our cultural\r\n\r\nconstruction,  including  the  formulation   of   a\r\n\r\nnational  cultural policy, the establishment  of  a\r\n\r\ncultural  consultative committee, a  national  film\r\n\r\nstudio,  a national academy of arts and the holding\r\n\r\nof  a  cultural  festival, etc.  These  suggestions\r\n\r\nhave,  in  fact,  largely been implemented  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture this year. This indeed  gives\r\n\r\nmuch cause for pleasure and encouragement. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment's  efforts  in  promoting  cultural  and\r\n\r\nartistic activities, the establishment of the  Arts\r\n\r\nCouncil,  the  building of a  national  academy  of\r\n\r\narts,   and   the   holding  of  creative   singing\r\n\r\ncompetitions  for the promotion  of  our  arts  and\r\n\r\nculture   deserve  our  unanimous   praise.   These\r\n\r\nachievements should be attributed to the  effective\r\n\r\nplanning  and  leadership of our able Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture and Social Affairs who is not here now, the\r\n\r\nMinister   of   State   for   Culture,   and    the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nCulture,  as well as to the full support  given  by\r\n\r\nsociety. As for the humble opinion given by myself,\r\n\r\nI  dare  not brag of its contributing merit in  any\r\n\r\nway. I was doing my duty as a representative of the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me review the general\r\n\r\nconditions and cultural activities in the past  one\r\n\r\nyear.  In  the past one year there have  been  more\r\n\r\ncultural and artistic activities than in any period\r\n\r\npreviously. This surely is an encouraging sign.  Of\r\n\r\nthese activities, those on a larger scale were  the\r\n\r\ncultural nights and recreational concerts organised\r\n\r\nby   the   People's  Association;   dramas,   local\r\n\r\ntraditional  plays and concerts,  etc.,  staged  by\r\n\r\nvarious  civic  organisations. Some of  our  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbranches, including the Sembawang Branch, also  put\r\n\r\nin some effort to promote local plays. In addition,\r\n\r\nin  the fields of painting and photography, many of\r\n\r\nour  young artists and photographers held  numerous\r\n\r\npublic exhibitions, presenting to the people  their\r\n\r\nworks on the description of the lives of the people\r\n\r\nand  reflecting the social realities. At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, many cultural and artistic organisations from\r\n\r\nabroad  came  here to perform, such as the  Russian\r\n\r\ndance  troupe, the Hongkong Sin Tian  Chye  Teochew\r\n\r\ndrama  company,  and the Hongkong  Thye  Loon  Hong\r\n\r\nCantonese drama company, etc., who brought  to  our\r\n\r\nmasses novel cultural recreations. According to the\r\n\r\nstatistics of the Ministry of Culture, from January\r\n\r\nto  October  this  year  various  cultural  nights,\r\n\r\ndramas, plays, concerts, choirs, carnivals, art and\r\n\r\nphotographic exhibitions, etc., were  held  at  the\r\n\r\nNational\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTheatre, Victoria Theatre and the Victoria Memorial\r\n\r\nHall,  on  217 occasions, some of which carried  on\r\n\r\nfor  one  or two weeks at a stretch. If these  were\r\n\r\nadded  together,  Sir, there  would  be  about  300\r\n\r\noccasions  of such activities. In other  words,  in\r\n\r\nour   country  there  are  different  cultural  and\r\n\r\nartistic  activities held every day to  enrich  the\r\n\r\nspiritual lives of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now follow up with the radio and\r\n\r\ntelevision  programmes. In the past one year  there\r\n\r\nhave  certainly been quite a lot of changes in  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes. We now have such programmes as  \"It  is\r\n\r\nHappening in Singapore\", the introduction  of  art,\r\n\r\nmusic  for the home, etc. At the same time, through\r\n\r\nthe exchange of new films with other countries,  we\r\n\r\nare  able to view the latest documentary news films\r\n\r\nof  many  countries. For instance, recently  Russia\r\n\r\ncelebrated  her  50th anniversary  of  the  October\r\n\r\nRevolution.  Our  people  were  able   to   see   a\r\n\r\ndocumentary  film  on this quite  soon  thereafter.\r\n\r\nBesides  these, Television Singapura also  arranged\r\n\r\nforums on political and social topics to enable the\r\n\r\npeople   to  have  more  understanding   of   these\r\n\r\nquestions.    Such   programmes   certainly    have\r\n\r\neducational value and I hope we will have  more  of\r\n\r\nthem hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a programme on physical exercise,\r\n\r\nteaching people how to get fit, but it has suddenly\r\n\r\ndisappeared.  In fact, this sort of  programmes  on\r\n\r\nphysical  and health education should not  only  be\r\n\r\npreserved but also further developed. For  example,\r\n\r\nthe  pugilistic  art  is now very  popular  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  Some of its basic movements should  prove\r\n\r\nvery  suitable  if made into films as instructional\r\n\r\nmaterial for broadcast to the viewers to help  them\r\n\r\nlearn  them.  Of  course,  in  the  beginning   the\r\n\r\nreaction of the viewers may not be favourable,  but\r\n\r\nif  Television Singapura persists and uses  various\r\n\r\nmethods to publicise the good points about learning\r\n\r\nphysical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexercise for health, I believe there will gradually\r\n\r\nbe good results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Radio and Television Singapura has great\r\n\r\nresponsibilities   in   spreading   knowledge   and\r\n\r\npromoting  culture  among the people.  At  present,\r\n\r\nthere are 67,000 sound receiver licence holders and\r\n\r\n76,000   combined  sound  and  television  receiver\r\n\r\nlicence holders. From these figures we can see  the\r\n\r\npopularity  of radio and television in our  country\r\n\r\nand the extensive influence they wield.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to touch on Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  on  culture.  The  Minister  of  State  for\r\n\r\nCulture,  Mr Lee Khoon Choy, on the 22nd  of  July\r\n\r\nthis  year, made a speech at a meeting of  the  Y's\r\n\r\nMen's Club of Singapore on the topic \"Search for  a\r\n\r\nnational culture in a multi-racial society\". And on\r\n\r\nthe  12th of October he made another speech at  the\r\n\r\nRotary Club of Singapore West meeting on the  topic\r\n\r\n\"The  Role of the Singapore Arts Council\". Each  of\r\n\r\nthese  two  speeches numbering  some  10,000  words\r\n\r\ndistinctively    and   comprehensively    expounded\r\n\r\nGovernment's cultural policy. The Minister of State\r\n\r\nhas  demonstrated his resolute endeavour to promote\r\n\r\nculture  and the arts of our country.  For  this  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to pay my heartfelt thanks to him.  But\r\n\r\nfollowing this praise, I must criticise what he has\r\n\r\nalready said. To show you what sort of criticism is\r\n\r\nforthcoming, I wish to quote from his speech on the\r\n\r\n\"Search  for  a national culture in a  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety\". He said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As democratic socialists, we do not believe that\r\n\r\nthe state should interfere with the private life of\r\n\r\nthe  individual or decide the taste for the  people\r\n\r\nin the field of art and culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not tell the people what types of\r\n\r\nclothing or hair-do they should put on. Would it be\r\n\r\nproper for the state to say what is the right music\r\n\r\nand   what  is  wrong  music  and  dictate  to  the\r\n\r\nmusicians   what  type  of  orchestral   theme   or\r\n\r\norchestration they must follow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people get the impression that it is the\r\n\r\nfunction  of the Ministry of Culture to  decide  on\r\n\r\nthe  pattern of clothings all Singaporeans have  to\r\n\r\nwear or make music, dances and plays which must  be\r\n\r\nfollowed  by  the  people.  This  may  be   so   in\r\n\r\ntotalitarian  countries  which  tend  to  put   the\r\n\r\nwriters,  artists, composers and generally cultural\r\n\r\nworkers into uniform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of totalitarianism, call it \"cultural\r\n\r\nrevolution\" or any name you like, is to destroy the\r\n\r\nautonomy  of every sphere of life and to bring  all\r\n\r\nfields of thought under the control of the State.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in another passage the Minister of State\r\n\r\nalso said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The pluralist theory demands that science,\r\n\r\nmusic,   literature  or  art  will  have  its   own\r\n\r\nautonomy.  Autonomy  does not  mean  that  science,\r\n\r\nmusic  and  other  forms  of  art  have  no  social\r\n\r\nfunction and social responsibilities.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He continued:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We feel that it is up to musicians, artists,\r\n\r\nscientists,  the cultural workers, the  people  and\r\n\r\nthe   representatives  of  the  Government  to  get\r\n\r\ntogether to discover ways and means of raising  the\r\n\r\nmusical  level or generally the artistic  level  of\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ways and means will also have to be found for\r\n\r\nenlisting  music, art, painting,  drama  and  other\r\n\r\nforms  of  artistic  expressions  in  the  task  of\r\n\r\ninstilling  national consciousness, a common  sense\r\n\r\nof  loyalty to the nation and generally  in  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully appreciate that through these\r\n\r\npassages the Minister of State for Culture has made\r\n\r\nclear  the  enlightened attitude of the  Government\r\n\r\ntowards  the  problems  of art  and  culture.  This\r\n\r\nattitude  advocates  free competition  amongst  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of different kinds of art and  culture\r\n\r\nin  our  country. At the same time,  this  attitude\r\n\r\nalso emphasises the social responsibility of art or\r\n\r\nculture   in  imbuing  the  people  with   national\r\n\r\nconsciousness, undivided loyalty and the concept of\r\n\r\nnation  building. This then is the positive  aspect\r\n\r\nof the Government's attitude.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in his talk on the \"The Role of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Arts Council\", the Minister of State  for\r\n\r\nCulture  again made clear his democratic  stand  on\r\n\r\nthe  question of having different arts and cultures\r\n\r\nwhen he said -I quote again:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The lighter entertainment programmes provided by\r\n\r\nthe  entertainment  industry have  an  overpowering\r\n\r\nnarcotic  effect on the mass audiences who  consume\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against this background that the Arts\r\n\r\nCouncil was formed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a democracy, the Arts Council or even the\r\n\r\nGovernment has certain limitations in deciding what\r\n\r\nis good or bad for the people. That is the price we\r\n\r\nhave to pay for democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been suggestions by some high-brow\r\n\r\nintellectuals  and those who are more puritanically\r\n\r\nminded that we should ban the twist, the a-go-go or\r\n\r\neven the James Bond, pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others felt that the lowbrow entertainment\r\n\r\nprogrammes should not be shown at all over the T.V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a democracy, particularly where the population\r\n\r\nis  multi-racial,  multi-religious,  multi-cultural\r\n\r\nand  multi-lingual, is it right for any section  of\r\n\r\nthe  community to impose its cultural taste  on  to\r\n\r\nthe others?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another passage, he also said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I do not believe that the passive methods of\r\n\r\nbanning this or that would solve problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires mental ruggedness to accept the\r\n\r\nchallenge to win over the minds of the young people\r\n\r\nto  the  side  of disciplined appreciation  of  the\r\n\r\nworthier things in life instead of allowing them to\r\n\r\nbe  won  over  by the sheer debasing, sub-artistic,\r\n\r\nuncivilised entertainments.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The Minister of State continued, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The lop-sided entertainment type of mass culture\r\n\r\nvia  the mass media while useful in performing  its\r\n\r\nfunction to dispel the boredom for the more elderly\r\n\r\ntired  mind, may be harmful in corrupting the minds\r\n\r\nof the youth and teenagers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most obnoxious aspects of all of these mass\r\n\r\nmedia and mass culture are those that destroy their\r\n\r\nsense  of  value, and corrode their willingness  to\r\n\r\npay attention to serious thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one of the main functions of the Arts\r\n\r\nCouncil  to see that our youths retain their  sense\r\n\r\nof balance and mental ruggedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to do so not by the passive way of\r\n\r\nwanting  this  or that banned, but by  constructive\r\n\r\nmeasures.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the two speeches delivered\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister of State for Culture on  cultural\r\n\r\npolicies  of the Government, I can draw  two  major\r\n\r\nconclusions.  One is to encourage and  support  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the arts and cultures of the various\r\n\r\ncommunities, and the other is to accept with strong\r\n\r\nwill-power  the  challenge from \"narcotic\"  culture\r\n\r\nwhich it is not proposed to ban but with which  the\r\n\r\nvigorous  development of healthy arts and  cultures\r\n\r\nmust compete\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeacefully. While this enlightened attitude  is  to\r\n\r\nbe praised, there arises the question of whether we\r\n\r\ncan  overcome  the  culture with narcotic  effects.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely the question for the attention of\r\n\r\nthe Minister. Will this kind of culture, if allowed\r\n\r\nto  go  on its way, impede our constructive efforts\r\n\r\nin  the promotion of healthy culture and art?  Will\r\n\r\nits  narcotic  effects poison  and  demoralise  our\r\n\r\nyounger generation? Does it have any adverse effect\r\n\r\non  the vigorous and rugged society that we seek to\r\n\r\nbuild?  These  are  the problems  that  arouse  our\r\n\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, some undergraduates of an institution\r\n\r\nof  higher  learning  in one  of  our  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries  were reported to have openly  invited  a\r\n\r\nstrip-teaser  for a performance. This dishonourable\r\n\r\nincident  caused  an  uproar  in  the  country   in\r\n\r\nquestion  and is worthy of our vigilance. In  fact,\r\n\r\nsome West European countries are bedevilled with  a\r\n\r\nserious   social  problem  arising   out   of   the\r\n\r\n\"hippies\". These are the crazy boys and  girls  who\r\n\r\nindulge in the beatnik and degenerated way of life.\r\n\r\nWhat  a  pity  they  are!  In  some  other  Western\r\n\r\ncountries,  the teenagers also indulge  in  corrupt\r\n\r\npleasures.   These  young  people  are   desultory,\r\n\r\nslovenly  and  unproductive, and have dragged  down\r\n\r\ntheir  national economy. Tracing the cause of  this\r\n\r\nserious social problem in the West, one finds  that\r\n\r\nit  is  closely  associated with the  laissez-faire\r\n\r\ncultural  policy which allows narcotic  and  erotic\r\n\r\nculture   to  flourish  freely  and  the  lack   of\r\n\r\nattention to ethical concepts. Therefore, in  order\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  our  society will  develop  along\r\n\r\nhealthy  lines  and succeed in bringing  up  a  new\r\n\r\ngeneration  of vigorous and rugged people,  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  we  should not adopt a laissez-faire attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  narcotic  and erotic  culture.  At  least,\r\n\r\nrestrictive measures should be taken to contain the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  such  culture. Far from being  passive,\r\n\r\nthis  is a positive step which is as proper as  the\r\n\r\nsurgical  operation required for the removal  of  a\r\n\r\nmalignant ulcer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, ours is a democratic socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment.

In\r\n\r\nthe  realm  of  culture,  I  think  the  democratic\r\n\r\nsocialist  ideas  of  art  and  culture  should  be\r\n\r\npatriotic,   not   traitorous,   progressive,   not\r\n\r\ndegenerative, positive, not negative, salutary, not\r\n\r\ndeleterious,   full  of  instructive   morals   and\r\n\r\nglorifying   the   dignity  of   labour   and   its\r\n\r\ncreativeness,  not tending to corrupt  and  corrode\r\n\r\nthe  minds of our youths. It follows that in  order\r\n\r\nto  promote  patriotic and progressive culture,  we\r\n\r\nmust get rid of all decadent cultures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say something about the\r\n\r\nArts   Council.  Ever  since  it  was  formed   and\r\n\r\nregistered as a body corporate in August this year,\r\n\r\nit has lost no time in launching out into all kinds\r\n\r\nof  cultural and artistic activities of  which  the\r\n\r\nmost  notable  one is the project  to  build  a  $3\r\n\r\nmillion  National Art Gallery and  Academy  of  the\r\n\r\nArts.  When  news of the project became  known,  it\r\n\r\nimmediately gained the enthusiastic support of  the\r\n\r\npublic  who donated generously towards the building\r\n\r\nfund  which now stands at over $700,000.  More  and\r\n\r\nmore  civic  organisations are  planning  to  raise\r\n\r\nfunds  for  the  project  through  the  staging  of\r\n\r\nconcerts  and variety shows. The Arts  Council  and\r\n\r\nthe   National  Theatre  Trust  will  also  jointly\r\n\r\norganise  a  big  scale Trade  Fair  for  the  same\r\n\r\npurpose. Meanwhile, the Press is also doing its bit\r\n\r\nby lending its support to the project. For example,\r\n\r\nin  its  editorial of 1st September entitled  \"Give\r\n\r\ngenerously  to  the building of the  Singapore  Art\r\n\r\nAcademy\", the Sin Chew Jit Poh wrote:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We hope that the public will warmly support the\r\n\r\nArts Council's proposal to build the Art Academy by\r\n\r\ngiving generous donations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso that the hope of having a sixth higher institute\r\n\r\nof learning in Singapore can materialise sooner.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>At  about the same time on 8th August, the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nSiang  Pau also voiced its support for the building\r\n\r\nof the National Art Gallery and Academy of the Arts\r\n\r\nby writing editorially:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We earnestly hope that with the support of all\r\n\r\nof  us  the  task undertaken by the Singapore  Arts\r\n\r\nCouncil to build a National Art Gallery and Academy\r\n\r\nof the Arts will be accomplished soon.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, it is my firm belief  That  with\r\n\r\nthe  support of the various communities and  people\r\n\r\nin all walks of life and the Press, the building of\r\n\r\nthe  National Art Gallery and Academy of the  Arts,\r\n\r\nwhich will have a great mission to perform, will be\r\n\r\ncompleted according to schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there has been tremendous\r\n\r\ndevelopment in our nation's culture and art in  the\r\n\r\npast  one year - a milestone in the history  of  our\r\n\r\nnation's  culture and art development. When  I  say\r\n\r\nthis,  I  am  not giving excessive  praise  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture, because the fact is that  1967\r\n\r\nhas  really  been a year of rapid  growth  of  our\r\n\r\nnation's culture. However, we must not be contented\r\n\r\nwith  what we have done. On the contrary,  we  must\r\n\r\nredouble  our  efforts to enable  our  multi-racial\r\n\r\nculture to blossom into brilliant flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make three suggestions to the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture and three suggestions  to  the\r\n\r\nArts Council relating to the culture and art of our\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I believe that the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nshould   organise   an  annual  national   Cultural\r\n\r\nFestival  to  provide  an opportunity  for  various\r\n\r\nraces   to   appreciate  and  enjoy  the  different\r\n\r\ncultures  and  arts and to learn from one  another.\r\n\r\nThis  will not only enrich the spiritual  lives  of\r\n\r\nthe people but will also make it possible to select\r\n\r\ntalent from the various cultural groups and  train\r\n\r\nthem  to  form  .a  national  corps  of  performing\r\n\r\nartistes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir  duty  will  be to show the rich  and  multi-coloured cultures of the Republic when they  go  on\r\n\r\nperforming  tours  abroad.  In  this  respect,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Social Affairs has already  made  its\r\n\r\nFestival  an  annual affair, while the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation also holds its Youth Festival annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion is the setting up of a\r\n\r\nnational  film  studio to produce films  which  are\r\n\r\neducational  in nature or films which  portray  the\r\n\r\ntask   of  nation  building.  I  put  forward  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion last year, but the reply I received then\r\n\r\nwas that there was a lack of funds for the project.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I think our Republic with its highly\r\n\r\ndeveloped  economy  can  afford  to  set  aside   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  sum of money for such a purpose.  The\r\n\r\nneed  for such expenditure is more compelling  when\r\n\r\nall  are agreed that investment in culture and art,\r\n\r\njust  as  investment in education, is a  worthwhile\r\n\r\ninvestment.  Therefore, I hope  that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill give serious consideration to my proposal.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, I also hope that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  will  be generous enough  to  approve  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure for such projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion is that in order to enable\r\n\r\nthe   labouring  class  to  enjoy  and   appreciate\r\n\r\nperformances  given  by foreign  artistes  who  are\r\n\r\nsponsored  by  the National Theatre  Trust,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary for the Trust to adopt a moderate pricing\r\n\r\npolicy   with  regard  to  the  sale  of  admission\r\n\r\ntickets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make three suggestions to the\r\n\r\nSingapore Arts Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as to the national theatre for art and\r\n\r\nculture,  the  Council should have a  comprehensive\r\n\r\npolicy  and a series of measures to carry out  this\r\n\r\npolicy  in  order  to better promote  cultural  and\r\n\r\nartistic activities in the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if it is possible, the Council should\r\n\r\ntake immediate steps to train the various kinds  of\r\n\r\nartists and teachers who in turn will have to teach\r\n\r\ntheir  students  to become artists in  the  various\r\n\r\nfields. Moreover, it must accept the responsibility  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  launching  out  into  all  kinds   of\r\n\r\ncultural activities in every nook and corner of our\r\n\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I understand that some of our artists are\r\n\r\nliving  in  wretched poverty.  To  enable  them  to\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on  their work, I  think  the  Council\r\n\r\nshould have plans to look after their livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I recite a poem to eulogise\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Culture for its achievement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n               `Blossoming are the flowers of culture\r\n\r\n                      everywhere,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Each vieing with one another in beauty and\r\n\r\n                      colour,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Great is the achievement of the Ministry of\r\n\r\n                      Culture,\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n                And may your name be for ever remembered \r\n\r\n                      in the annals of our nation.'\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang spoke at length on the policy\r\n\r\nof the Ministry of Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short space of time that I have been\r\n\r\nattached  to  the  Ministry  of  Culture,  I   have\r\n\r\nobserved  the Ministry carrying out its  objectives\r\n\r\nof  keeping  our  people informed and  successfully\r\n\r\nbringing  about  cultural integration  quietly  and\r\n\r\nwithout  fuss.  Considerable  changes  in  cultural\r\n\r\nrevolutions  take place in countries from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime   in  accordance  with  the  change  of  time,\r\n\r\nconditions,  and  environment  which  transform   a\r\n\r\nsociety  radically  into  the  new  trend  and  new\r\n\r\nsituation.  There are countries which  follow  `the\r\n\r\ncultural  revolution with violence and strife,  and\r\n\r\nthere  are  countries  which  follow  the  cultural\r\n\r\nchanges with guided or no democracy at all. But  we\r\n\r\nin  a democratic State can only explain, encourage,\r\n\r\nand  prepare  the ground and provide the  necessary\r\n\r\nincentives  for  a  revolution  and  growth  of   a\r\n\r\nnational concept of our own. But given our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nability in innovation and change, I am sure that in\r\n\r\ndue   course   a   culture,  embodying   the   best\r\n\r\ncharacteristics  of  our heritage  and  traditions,\r\n\r\nwill emerge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959 when the Ministry of Culture was first\r\n\r\nset   up,  there  was  little  cultural  amity   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The various cultural and racial  groups\r\n\r\ntended  to  look inwards, being proud of their  own\r\n\r\ntraditions,  and  were isolated from  one  another.\r\n\r\nCultural integration seemed hardly a practical idea\r\n\r\nthen.  Now,  after  eight years,  it  can  be  said\r\n\r\nwithout   fear  that  there  has  been  a  definite\r\n\r\nbreaking  down of these barriers that stem cultural\r\n\r\nprogress. There is acceptance of the fact that in a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial and multi-lingual society  the  people\r\n\r\nmust  co-operate along cultural lines  to  forge  a\r\n\r\nnational identity and the awareness of belonging to\r\n\r\nour Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the ages nations have been split\r\n\r\nasunder as a result of cultural differences arising\r\n\r\nfrom  differences in race, religion, language,  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  Only a few days ago there was a threat  of\r\n\r\nwar  in an island in the West, and it is clear that\r\n\r\nthe  problems there became acute, partly from  `the\r\n\r\nindifference to attempt to integrate the  two  main\r\n\r\nracial  groups with the different cultures in  the'\r\n\r\nisland.  We cannot afford such a happening  in  our\r\n\r\nisland of Singapore, and hence we have to be  aware\r\n\r\nof the need for a common culture to weld our people\r\n\r\ntogether  into  a  tightly-knit  society.   It   is\r\n\r\nimportant,  therefore, that we  should  not  become\r\n\r\ncomplacent  and slacken our efforts to bring  about\r\n\r\ncultural  co-operation and integration.  The  years\r\n\r\nahead,  therefore, call for an even more  intensive\r\n\r\npursuit   of  our  present  cultural  policy.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture is making strenuous efforts  in\r\n\r\nthe  pursuit of these objectives despite shortages\r\n\r\nof  staff and funds, but in the knowledge  that  we\r\n\r\nare  racing against time. Therefore, in order  that\r\n\r\nthere  can  be  no  let-up in our  activities,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry is doing everything it can in the  pursuit\r\n\r\nof our national objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nfirst of all, I wish to thank\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Sembawang for his kind words  about\r\n\r\nme  and for his constructive criticisms. His  words\r\n\r\nare  very  encouraging. But at the  same  time  his\r\n\r\npraise is a little embarrassing, because if we  can\r\n\r\nsay  that cultural activities in Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\npast   year   have   really   developed   and   are\r\n\r\nflourishing,  then credit should be  given  to  the\r\n\r\ncivic  organisations of art, the  various  cultural\r\n\r\nworkers, and those of our people who love art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in a democracy, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture  is  not  a  Ministry  to  create  art  and\r\n\r\nculture. Neither is it a controlling Ministry in so\r\n\r\nfar  as  culture is concerned. Art and culture  are\r\n\r\nmatters  which should come spontaneously  from  the\r\n\r\npeople,  from the art groups, and from the cultural\r\n\r\nworkers.  Art  and culture must come  up  from  the\r\n\r\nground to the top, and not imposed from the top  on\r\n\r\nto  the ground. So if we only have to depend  on  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  agency like the Ministry of Culture  to\r\n\r\ncreate a national culture, then in my view we  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  fail in our objectives,  because,  as  I\r\n\r\nsay,  the  Ministry of Culture is  not  a  creative\r\n\r\nMinistry.  All that it can do is to give some  form\r\n\r\nof  assistance  and encouragement.  So  it  is  the\r\n\r\npeople  themselves, the cultural workers,  who  are\r\n\r\nresponsible for the creation of a national culture.\r\n\r\nAnd   if  the  flowers  of  culture  should   bloom\r\n\r\neverywhere,  then  the  credit  should  go  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang said a few moments ago\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  establishment of the Singapore  Arts\r\n\r\nCouncil, the setting up of the Academy of Arts, and\r\n\r\nthe  National Gallery, there might have  been  some\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding about the Singapore  Arts  Council\r\n\r\nsimply because he was under the impression that  it\r\n\r\nwas   set  up  by  the  Government.  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Arts  Council was  not  set  up  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. It was set up by the joint  efforts  of\r\n\r\ncivic organisations active in the field of art.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  both  the National Academy of Arts  and  the\r\n\r\nNational  Gallery will be set up through the  joint\r\n\r\nefforts  of  civic  organisations.  So  since   the\r\n\r\nresponse has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome  from  the  people, the  Government  must,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  do its own share by co-operating with  the\r\n\r\npeople   in   order  to  bring  about  an   earlier\r\n\r\nrealisation of our objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Sembawang also\r\n\r\nmentioned the song competition. This competition is\r\n\r\norganised by the Singapore Arts Council and not  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Culture.  So  we  must  draw   a\r\n\r\ndistinction between the two bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang made a reference to the\r\n\r\nsudden    disappearance   of   physical    exercise\r\n\r\nprogrammes on television. I have an explanation  to\r\n\r\ngive  for  it. Initially, we telecast a  series  of\r\n\r\nabout 26 programmes on physical exercises. Then  we\r\n\r\nhad    \"The   daily   dozen\",   a   programme    on\r\n\r\ncallisthenics. All these programmes  were  produced\r\n\r\nin  series,  and  they  have  all  been  completely\r\n\r\ntelecast.  So we are now faced with the problem  of\r\n\r\nmaterials for a new programme. Through the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Culture, the Broadcasting Department has written\r\n\r\na  letter to the National Sports Central Board  for\r\n\r\ntheir co-operation in this matter. All along, these\r\n\r\nprogrammes  on  physical exercises or callisthenics\r\n\r\ninvolved   basketball,  table  tennis,  and   other\r\n\r\nexercises  and  games, both indoors  and  outdoors.\r\n\r\nMost of the viewers treated such programmes as  any\r\n\r\nother  television programmes. There was  no  active\r\n\r\nparticipation on the part of viewers.  So  we  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the National Sports Central Board can  assist\r\n\r\nus  by  teaching people how to play,  for  example,\r\n\r\nbasketball, tennis, table tennis, football, or  any\r\n\r\nother  game.  In other words, we require  programme\r\n\r\nmaterials to teach the people the skills  in  these\r\n\r\ngames.  These programmes will be telecast,  and  we\r\n\r\nhope  that we can get adequate assistance  and  co-operation. In this way, viewers will not just  view\r\n\r\nfor  the  sake of viewing but they will  have  some\r\n\r\nform of active participation in the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the National Pugilistic Arts\r\n\r\nCouncil  has  just  been established,  and  we  are\r\n\r\npreparing to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget  in touch with this Council for help by way  of\r\n\r\ncoaches and materials. We want them to help  us  by\r\n\r\ngetting someone to demonstrate on television how to\r\n\r\ntake  up the pugilistic art. This is a part of  our\r\n\r\nfuture programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time T.V. Singapura is also making\r\n\r\nheadway not only in the field of sports but also in\r\n\r\nart.  They  are planning together with the  various\r\n\r\norganisations  a full programme for  the  whole  of\r\n\r\nnext  year.  This  programme will  emphasise  local\r\n\r\ncreations  of the arts, such as dances  and  music,\r\n\r\nand  other  forms of artistic expression.  In  this\r\n\r\nway,  we will have more local works of art for  the\r\n\r\nconsumption  of our people, and such artistic  work\r\n\r\nwill  reflect  the  aspirations and  lives  of  our\r\n\r\npeople,  so  that  they will see some  glimpses  of\r\n\r\nthemselves on television. In doing all this and  in\r\n\r\nimplementing this programme, we cannot satisfy  the\r\n\r\ninterests  and needs of each and every one  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  because  there  is  a  time  limit   in\r\n\r\ntelevising programmes. For example, in one month we\r\n\r\nallocate  a  certain  number  of  hours   for   the\r\n\r\npugilistic art. Other programmes will then have  to\r\n\r\nwait; programmes such as table tennis, because  of\r\n\r\nlimitation  of funds and time. This,  I  hope,  the\r\n\r\npeople will appreciate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I wish to deal with another aspect raised\r\n\r\nby   the  Member  for  Sembawang.  He  has  quoted\r\n\r\nextensively from the two speeches I gave  recently.\r\n\r\nThe  impression  I  get is that he  seems  to  have\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  what  I said. For  example,  he  has\r\n\r\nalleged  that  I  do  not propose  to  ban  harmful\r\n\r\nnarcotic culture. This is a misunderstanding.  What\r\n\r\nI  said was that I do not wish to ban this or that.\r\n\r\nI  have  not said that I do not want to ban harmful\r\n\r\nnarcotic  culture.  So I have to  explain  that  by\r\n\r\n\"this  and that\", I meant those forms which  appear\r\n\r\nto  be  yellow  but are not actually  yellow.  Some\r\n\r\npeople  may  say  that a certain artistic  form  is\r\n\r\nyellow,  others may not. So this is a  question  of\r\n\r\nopinion.  It  is difficult for one to impose  one's\r\n\r\nviews on another\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperson. It is also a matter of degree. For example,\r\n\r\nin  the  field of art, if you go to Paris to  learn\r\n\r\nart, the first lesson you may have could be to draw\r\n\r\na  model  in  the nude. So what yardstick  are  you\r\n\r\ngoing  to  adopt? If you want to measure yellowness\r\n\r\nby  the  weight of clothing, then I would say  that\r\n\r\nballet dancers have the lightest weight and the  A-Go-Go dancers have the heaviest weight. So how  can\r\n\r\nyou  say this is yellow and that is not yellow?  By\r\n\r\nwhat  standard  do you judge? I  do  not  mean,  by\r\n\r\nsaying  all these things, that I appreciate A-Go-Go\r\n\r\nmore  than  ballet. In fact, it is  the  other  way\r\n\r\nround.  What  I am trying to say is that  different\r\n\r\npeople   have   different  tastes  and   standards.\r\n\r\nFurther,  if  I  were  to ban  A-Go-Go,  then  some\r\n\r\nyoungsters might accuse me of being unfair, because\r\n\r\nA-Go-Go dancers are fully clad. So how can  we  say\r\n\r\nthat A-Go-Go is yellow. Russia is a Communist and a\r\n\r\ntotalitarian  country.  It  is  the  motherland  of\r\n\r\nCommunism.  I  wish to draw the  attention  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Sembawang to the present issue of \"Life\"\r\n\r\nmagazine  which  has  devoted  some  space  to  the\r\n\r\ncelebrations of the 50th anniversary of the October\r\n\r\nRevolution in Russia. There are some pictures which\r\n\r\ndepict  \"hippies\".  Even in a totalitarian  country\r\n\r\nlike  Russia, these hippies exist. They  appear  in\r\n\r\npublic,  but  it  does  not mean  that  Russia  has\r\n\r\nadopted  a laissez-faire cultural policy  and  that\r\n\r\ntheir control is not strict and therefore we should\r\n\r\nbe more strict. So this is a question worthy of our\r\n\r\ndiscussion.  I  have been given to understand  that\r\n\r\nthe  young  people  in Russia call  themselves  the\r\n\r\nfourth generation. The first generation was of  the\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries, the second generation of the World\r\n\r\nWar,  the  third  generation of  science,  and  the\r\n\r\nfourth  generation is a rich generation. They  feel\r\n\r\nthat  those  in the fourth generation  should  have\r\n\r\nsome  freedom  in choosing their own private  life.\r\n\r\nDoes  it mean that a Communist country like  Russia\r\n\r\nis very liberal and that we should outdo it in this\r\n\r\nrespect?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am in full agreement with the\r\n\r\ncontention of the Member for Sembawang that we must\r\n\r\nnot be too liberal and we must not adopt a laissez-faire policy on culture. In fact, the measures that\r\n\r\nwe  have  taken  have  already been  criticised  by\r\n\r\nothers as being too restrictive. I can give  you  a\r\n\r\nfew  examples. In the first instance, from  October\r\n\r\n1966   to   September   1967  we   banned   various\r\n\r\nperiodicals.   We   have   banned    341    Chinese\r\n\r\npublications.  Altogether there  were  some  30,000\r\n\r\ncopies.  We  have  banned records amounting  to  42\r\n\r\ncategories. Altogether such categories  of  records\r\n\r\namount to some 3,400 copies. In the case of English\r\n\r\nperiodicals, we have banned some 738 types. We have\r\n\r\nbanned  two types of Malay publications  and  eight\r\n\r\ntypes   of  Indian  publications.  From  all  these\r\n\r\nrestrictive  measures we can say that we  have  not\r\n\r\nadopted a laissez-faire policy on culture. Recently\r\n\r\nsome  importers  of yellow publications  have  been\r\n\r\nprosecuted and fined. In fact, the officials of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture are always in close touch  with\r\n\r\nthe  police and they have conducted surprise  raids\r\n\r\non book-shops and confiscated yellow books and even\r\n\r\nprosecuted the distributors in court. We  have  had\r\n\r\nseveral  cases recently. Mr Speaker, Sir, what  is\r\n\r\nthe  nature of the publications banned? I can  give\r\n\r\nyou  a  few  examples. Recently we have banned  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  types of publications: for example,  the\r\n\r\n\"Sex Club\", the \"Paradise of Cupid\", \"Night Life in\r\n\r\nHong  Kong\". All these books have been  banned.  So\r\n\r\nyou cannot say that we are very liberal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of films we have also been\r\n\r\ncriticised  for being too strict in our censorship.\r\n\r\nWe  have banned about 21 films this year, including\r\n\r\n\"The   Game  is  over\";  \"The  Young  World\";  \"The\r\n\r\nSeducer\";  \"Blow  Up\", etc. All  these  are  erotic\r\n\r\nfilms.  So  again, we have shown that we  have  not\r\n\r\nadopted  a  laissez-faire  policy.  We  have   been\r\n\r\naccused of being too strict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge to which I have referred in my\r\n\r\nspeeches  refers to the challenge of  things  which\r\n\r\nappear to be yellow but are not actually yellow. We\r\n\r\nhave  to  direct the attention of our young  people\r\n\r\nfrom  such  culture  to  a  more  serious  type  of\r\n\r\nculture. I do not believe that we will fail in  our\r\n\r\nefforts, because we must have confidence in our own\r\n\r\npeople. We are not escapists. We are not fatalists.\r\n\r\nSo long as the cultural workers are united and work\r\n\r\ntogether,  I believe we can make Singapore  one  of\r\n\r\nthe most cultured countries in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the proposals put up by the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Sembawang,  one  is  on  a   cultural\r\n\r\nfestival.  The  Ministry of Culture have  organised\r\n\r\ncultural festivals in the past. In fact, we propose\r\n\r\nto  organise one this year. But cultural  festivals\r\n\r\nrequire  funds. We require a lot of money. All  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes have to be paid for. The funds  allotted\r\n\r\nfor this year have already been exhausted. When you\r\n\r\norganise art festivals, you must spend money. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  believe one can make money out of art.  It  is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult.  To  come  back,  next  year,   in\r\n\r\nconjunction with our National Day celebration,  the\r\n\r\nArts  Council  will  organise  a  massive  cultural\r\n\r\nfestival. It will display 100 per cent local works.\r\n\r\nThis  is to encourage our own people to create more\r\n\r\nworks  of  art  and take part in the  National  Day\r\n\r\nfestival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the setting up of a National Film Studio.\r\n\r\nThis  again requires money. Our Government has many\r\n\r\npriorities in other fields over the setting up of a\r\n\r\nstudio.  Because of these priorities,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nplace culture second. But within limits we can  ask\r\n\r\nour  people  to  help solve our financial  problems\r\n\r\nwith their kind donations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the National Theatre Trust,\r\n\r\nthe  proposal from the Member concerned was  a  low\r\n\r\npricing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy.  In  order  to help others,  we  must  help\r\n\r\nourselves  first. Before you can help  others,  you\r\n\r\nmust  see that you are in a position to help  them.\r\n\r\nThe  position of the National Theatre Trust is that\r\n\r\nit  is  autonomous and independent, and it  has  to\r\n\r\ndepend  on rents and hire charges for its survival.\r\n\r\nEven  then  it  is very difficult for  it  to  find\r\n\r\nenough  money  to  make  ends  meet.  The  National\r\n\r\nTheatre  Trust has to get more foreign  troupes  to\r\n\r\nperform here to raise more funds. And if we adopt a\r\n\r\nlow pricing policy, then we will be losing a lot of\r\n\r\nbusiness and money. This is the difficulty  of  the\r\n\r\nNational Theatre Trust. The problems are many.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's suggestion of an Arts Council, we\r\n\r\nhave  overall  planning for this project,  and  the\r\n\r\nfirst  part  of  the planning is  to  raise  funds.\r\n\r\nWithout money we cannot do anything. We propose  to\r\n\r\nbuild a National Academy of the Arts and a National\r\n\r\nArt  Gallery costing about $3 million. So  we  must\r\n\r\nhave funds for the buildings first. We have set  up\r\n\r\nsub-committees to carry out other programmes. These\r\n\r\nsub-committees  will marshal all the  musicians  in\r\n\r\nSingapore into one sub-committee on music. Likewise\r\n\r\nfor dancing, publications, drama and other artistic\r\n\r\nforms  of  art. It is the hope of the Arts  Council\r\n\r\nthat all cultural workers and those engaged in  art\r\n\r\nwill  come together and launch a campaign to  raise\r\n\r\nour cultural standards. The emphasis is on creative\r\n\r\nwork.  So  the  second proposal  is  to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nnational  training  centre for artistic  personnel.\r\n\r\nThis  is  already part of our plan. The Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang may have heard that in 1968 we intend  to\r\n\r\nhold  an  Exposition.  This  Exposition  is  to  be\r\n\r\norganised  by  the  Arts Council and  the  National\r\n\r\nTheatre  Trust. The proceeds will be divided  on  a\r\n\r\n50/50 basis. This will give us about $250,000. This\r\n\r\nwill be of great help. Our aim is to reach $500,000\r\n\r\nand  we  can raise $250,000 by the Exposition  next\r\n\r\nyear for the National Theatre Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the duty of the National Theatre Company,\r\n\r\nwhich we propose to set\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup,  to put up various performances and plays.  The\r\n\r\nArts  Council  will encourage our local  people  to\r\n\r\nwrite  their own plays, choreography and music  for\r\n\r\nperformance by the National Theatre Company. So  we\r\n\r\nrequire  a  lot  of  directors  and  other  skilled\r\n\r\npersonnel. With money available, we can do all this\r\n\r\nwork. The life of artistes is very difficult and  I\r\n\r\nthink the Member for Sembawang cannot claim to know\r\n\r\nmore  than  I do, because, in my view, it  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to make a living by art. So to look after\r\n\r\nthe  artistes, we require plenty of money.  At  the\r\n\r\npresent  stage,  when the Arts Council  is  raising\r\n\r\nfunds for the setting up of the National Academy of\r\n\r\nthe Arts, perhaps the artistes themselves will have\r\n\r\nto  appreciate the difficulties of the Arts Council\r\n\r\nand redouble their efforts to ensure that our plans\r\n\r\nwill  succeed. Then and only then will we have  the\r\n\r\ntime  and energy to improve the livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\nartistes. This we hope to do in future and we  will\r\n\r\nencourage   the   artistes   in   their    creative\r\n\r\nendeavours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is our hope that not only the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang but also  other  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament and the people at large will  take  more\r\n\r\ninterest in the promotion of culture and art. If we\r\n\r\nhave erred in any way, we hope to have constructive\r\n\r\ncriticisms, and if we have done well in some  other\r\n\r\nfields,  perhaps we require words of encouragement.\r\n\r\nBy  encouragement,  I  do not  mean  singing  empty\r\n\r\npraises.  I have already said that the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture is not a creative Ministry and that  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  people  who  deserve the  praise.  The  praise\r\n\r\nshould   go  to  the  artistes  themselves,   their\r\n\r\norganisations and the people in general.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Sixteen minutes past Seven o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Monday, 11th December,1967.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1967/19671205/19671205-HA-0260503.pdf\"\">Appendix \"A\" to Annual Budget Statement(Col.448) (Cols 0503-0504)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1967/19671205/19671205-HA-0260505.pdf\"\">Appendix \"B\" to Annual Budget Statement(Col.448) (Cols 0505-0506)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
