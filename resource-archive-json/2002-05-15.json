Looking back a few years ago,  we  also  saw\r\n\r\nglimpses  of racial issues when hiring practices  of  certain\r\n\r\ntype  of  employers were openly discussed here.   While  most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  behaved rationally through all  the  periods  I\r\n\r\nmentioned,  at the ground level there were quite  a  few  who\r\n\r\nfelt  otherwise and raised suspicions about the other  races.\r\n\r\nThe  levels of these suspicions are still not widespread  and\r\n\r\nare  not  a  cause  of  major concern  yet.   It  nonetheless\r\n\r\nhighlights how delicate the situation can be and therefore we\r\n\r\ncannot take things for granted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nation, we have made progress in many areas,\r\n\r\nincluding  inter-racial ties.  When I was growing up  in  the\r\n\r\n1960s  and  1970s,  most of us were not so conscious  of  our\r\n\r\nraces  and we grew up thinking of each other as more or  less\r\n\r\nthe  same.   The  changes which happened in the  1980s  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of certain policies and practices started causing  the\r\n\r\nrealisation  of  our differences and thus resulting  in  some\r\n\r\nweaknesses  in the race relations' foundations which  we  are\r\n\r\nstill building.  Some of these policies and practices causing\r\n\r\nthe  problems are: first, creating the ethnic based self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  where each feels that only their own kind  will  help\r\n\r\nthem;  second, high profile campaigns like the Speak Mandarin\r\n\r\nCampaigns which are all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nright on their own, but which were not very well explained in\r\n\r\nthe early years leading to suspicions of the intent of such a\r\n\r\ncampaign; third, school practices of segregating children  by\r\n\r\nthe  language streams that they came from in the past.  While\r\n\r\nthis  is  less  of  a problem now, it was a  problem  before;\r\n\r\nfourth, the creation of SAP schools which again is all  right\r\n\r\nfor  the  intended  purpose,  but  other  races  never  fully\r\n\r\nunderstood  the  need  for them; fifth, putting  emphasis  on\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  and  using  it as  a  means  of  grading  and\r\n\r\nmeasuring  children's abilities to move forward in  education\r\n\r\ncausing  our  children to focus a lot on their mother  tongue\r\n\r\nand also emphasis on them interacting with each other so that\r\n\r\nthey could practise the language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While policies are important, it is equally important\r\n\r\nthat  our people interact with each other in schools  and  in\r\n\r\ntheir  daily  lives  to  build  up  bonds.   Today,  we   and\r\n\r\nespecially  our children do not have enough opportunities  to\r\n\r\ninteract  with each other.  Even when they go to our  secular\r\n\r\nschools, they tend to largely congregate along racial  lines.\r\n\r\nThe  long  term trend can be detrimental and unless our  race\r\n\r\nrelations  have  sufficient  depth  and  can  withstand   any\r\n\r\nstresses,  we  will have serious problems should  any  racial\r\n\r\nproblems  arise.   We  should not be complacent  because  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of race issues and stresses we have seen is small  and\r\n\r\nour laws could contain any potential problem.  My opinion  is\r\n\r\nthat should we see any high levels of stresses, the seemingly\r\n\r\ngood racial ties here may not necessarily remain good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore need to do more to ensure that our people\r\n\r\nare  really close to each other and go from beyond  tolerance\r\n\r\nand  understanding to fully accepting each other and adapting\r\n\r\nto each other's way of life.  Each of us has to make personal\r\n\r\nchanges.   We  cannot  live  in a cocoon  and  think  that  a\r\n\r\nparticular  race's  problem is not our own  personal  problem\r\n\r\nbecause  we are all living in the same neighbourhood and  any\r\n\r\nproblems in the neighbourhood will inevitably affect  all  of\r\n\r\nus.  I would like to suggest three initiatives that will help\r\n\r\nus deepen racial ties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, organising self-help groups along ethnic\r\n\r\nlines.   I  believe it is about time that we broke this  into\r\n\r\ntwo  components.  The first component basically  consists  of\r\n\r\nadministrative  fund raising and coordination  issues.   This\r\n\r\ncould  make  up of people from all ethnic races.  The  second\r\n\r\ncomponent  should be the component that actually reaches  out\r\n\r\nto  the  various ethnic groups.  Because that has  been  very\r\n\r\neffective,  the  ethnic group approach  of  reaching  out  to\r\n\r\npeople has been the right thing to do.  By organising the way\r\n\r\nwe are organising right now ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh, I think you need to be\r\n\r\nshort.  Please get to the point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Okay. The smaller ethnic groups\r\n\r\nactually  have  problems  raising funds.   When  we  organise\r\n\r\nourselves along the suggestion I am making, it will help them\r\n\r\nto  lessen the problem.  The second problem is that  our  SAP\r\n\r\nschool  children  and  Madrasah  children  do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunities to interact with children of other races.  So I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  suggest that schools  implement  a  twinning\r\n\r\nconcept  where  SAP schools and Madrasahs  are  twinned  with\r\n\r\nsecular  schools so that, during academic time, the  children\r\n\r\ncan  spend  time  in  the  various schools.   But  when  they\r\n\r\nparticipate in CCA and ECA activities, the children from  the\r\n\r\nSAP  or  Madrasah  schools should  do  it  jointly  with  the\r\n\r\nstudents  from the twinned secular schools and, in this  way,\r\n\r\nthey  will have an opportunity to interact almost on a  daily\r\n\r\nbasis.   If  they  grow  up  doing this,  they  will  get  to\r\n\r\nunderstand each other even better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I fully support the implementation of the IRCC.\r\n\r\nI see it as an equaliser of races. It does not matter how big\r\n\r\nthe  size of the ethnic group is.  Everyone should be equally\r\n\r\nrepresented in this group.  And I hope that the Minister will\r\n\r\nconsider funding this group sufficiently so that they can  do\r\n\r\na lot more than just being coordinating agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have taken five minutes, Mr Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\ntake  this opportunity to support Mr Inderjit's call and call\r\n\r\nfor  more  multi-racial  approach to solving  this  country's\r\n\r\nchallenges.  One of the major challenges that we have  is  to\r\n\r\nreach out and provide help to children from poor families  so\r\n\r\nthat they will not be caught in the poverty trap.  This calls\r\n\r\nfor  a national effort.  Right now, this role is carried  out\r\n\r\nmostly  by  ethnic-based self-help  groups.   Each  of  these\r\n\r\ngroups  has done very good work.  But some, such as the  CDCs\r\n\r\nand  CDAC, have more resources than others.  This is in terms\r\n\r\nof  funding  and volunteer base.  This means that those  with\r\n\r\nless  resources, such as SINDA and the Eurasian  Association,\r\n\r\nmay  be handicapped in their mission.  Moreover, not all have\r\n\r\nthe same access to management expertise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we also see a growing number of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans of the different races volunteering to serve  in\r\n\r\nthese  groups  and  they come from all races  -  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nserving at SINDA and MENDAKI, the Malay serving at CDAC,  and\r\n\r\nso on and so forth.  This is a healthy sign and it shows that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans do want a multi-racial approach.  It would  make\r\n\r\nsense  for  one  multi-racial  body  as  the  managing  agent\r\n\r\noverseeing  such services and tapping from  a  wide  pool  of\r\n\r\nvolunteers  and funds, rather than the different ethnic-based\r\n\r\ngroups tapping from their own narrow base.  If I have a Malay\r\n\r\nresident coming to me seeking for help, I would not  have  to\r\n\r\nrefer  him  to MENDAKI, but to this multi-racial body.   This\r\n\r\nway, poor students from the different races will then also be\r\n\r\nable to attend the same classes together and they will not be\r\n\r\nsegregated.  It will also send the right signals  so  crucial\r\n\r\nin  these times.  That you do not have to depend on your  own\r\n\r\nkind  to  help you when you need the help.  This is the  time\r\n\r\nfor  us  to foster this confidence and not wait until a  race\r\n\r\nriot  occurs for us to find out that we cannot depend on  the\r\n\r\nother.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us, at this time, push forward this multi-racial\r\n\r\nagenda.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the September 11\r\n\r\nincident has given us an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noccasion to examine our multi-racial policy.  After 35  years\r\n\r\nof  independence, we have to ask ourselves whether   we  want\r\n\r\nour  society to continue in its plural form where  the  State\r\n\r\ncontinues  to accept and work with the various ethnic  groups\r\n\r\nor  do we want to allow society to evolve naturally with  the\r\n\r\neffluxion of time so that, with it, we have a common cultural\r\n\r\nidentity emerging that is characterised to a large extent  by\r\n\r\ncross cultural influences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this point may well be illustrated by looking at\r\n\r\nthe American society.  We all know that the United States  is\r\n\r\ncharacterised largely by a society that is made up of migrant\r\n\r\npeople, it is cosmopolitan in nature.  But, however,  if  you\r\n\r\nlook  at  the third and fourth generations, it would be  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  for them to continue with their cultural practices\r\n\r\nand   native  language.   Many  American-born  Chinese,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  grow  up  in  the US without speaking  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage properly.  And yet, in America, you find that  there\r\n\r\nis  an  emerging  distinct  identity  of  Americans  who  see\r\n\r\nthemselves as a new American that is divorced almost entirely\r\n\r\nfrom  their ethnic origins.  This is the kind of new American\r\n\r\nthat  has  created a separate and distinct identity that  the\r\n\r\nworld can identify with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we may well ask whether the United States' model\r\n\r\nhas  any  relevance for us here.  I would say yes,  when  you\r\n\r\nlook  at it from the perspective of community bonding.   Sir,\r\n\r\nby community bonding, one would suppose a sense of feeling as\r\n\r\none, united by a common cultural experience and founded in  a\r\n\r\ncommon  language.  The Singapore model, for want of a  better\r\n\r\nword,  arguably works towards the reinforcement of  different\r\n\r\ncultural identities.  In our official media, for example,  we\r\n\r\npay  formal recognition to the four major languages  that  we\r\n\r\nidentify  as  official.  In many public  functions  that  are\r\n\r\norganised    by   State   agencies   and   community    based\r\n\r\norganisations,  the  organisers  are  required  to  pay   the\r\n\r\nobligatory  lip service by ensuring that the  dances  of  the\r\n\r\nfour  major  ethnic groups are represented.  I am quite  sure\r\n\r\nthat  this  phenomenon takes place across the island.   While\r\n\r\npursuing this separate and distinct\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncultural  identity to a fault, the question that we  have  to\r\n\r\nask  is  whether  such  policies will  help  to  promote  and\r\n\r\nreinforce  community bonding here.  My suspicion is  that  it\r\n\r\ndoes not.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from witnessing more cross-cultural exchanges, my\r\n\r\nown  observation  and experience is that  ethnic  groups  are\r\n\r\nbecoming  more  insular  and inward-looking  in  their  daily\r\n\r\nlives.   Is  it any wonder that when RCs organise educational\r\n\r\nvisits,  it  is  mainly the Chinese who attend  these  tours,\r\n\r\nperhaps  because temple visits are a part of  the  itinerary?\r\n\r\nIs  it any wonder also that Malays also prefer the comfort of\r\n\r\ninteracting  within the extended family and the  confines  of\r\n\r\nthe  mosques?  And is it any wonder that most CCs often  find\r\n\r\nit difficult to have more members for the IAECs because there\r\n\r\nare not enough of such volunteers around?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the retreat to their comfort zones is no doubt\r\n\r\nspurred  on  by  the  greater familiarity of  the  respective\r\n\r\nlanguages.  Unless such tendencies are checked, it  would  be\r\n\r\ndifficult indeed to see how greater community bonding  across\r\n\r\nraces can be achieved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, society and cultural values and practices have a\r\n\r\nway of evolving naturally that is not necessarily defined  by\r\n\r\nthe  state.   I believe that any body of people  would,  over\r\n\r\ntime, produce a set of shared values and practices that forms\r\n\r\nthe basis of the group's identity that need not be determined\r\n\r\nextraneously.   In  our  case, we could  perhaps  use  proper\r\n\r\nSingapore English as a basis for the new Singaporean identity\r\n\r\nthat transcends all individual cultural barriers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we accept this suggestion as the way forward, we\r\n\r\nhave   to  fundamentally  redefine  the  way  in  which   our\r\n\r\nGovernment  takes the initiative in preserving  our  cultural\r\n\r\nheritage.   For instance, the Speak Mandarin Campaign  should\r\n\r\nbe   left  entirely  to  the  community  groups  to  promote.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  the various community self-help organisations,  as\r\n\r\nmy two colleagues had advocated eloquently\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearlier,  should  be  reorganised into  one  large  self-help\r\n\r\norganisation  that  is  independent  of  race,  language   or\r\n\r\nreligion.  The Government, on the other hand, could well just\r\n\r\nallow  and  focus on the natural development  of  the  proper\r\n\r\nSingapore  English.   Over time, it is hoped  that  a  common\r\n\r\nlanguage  will  be  the  social glue that  binds  the  people\r\n\r\ntogether  and, over time, it is hoped that our people  should\r\n\r\nnot  feel that they have lost their cultural heritage  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  they do not speak the language.  What matters  most,\r\n\r\nas  I have said earlier, is that they must feel that they are\r\n\r\nstill  who they are ethnically and yet, at the same time,  be\r\n\r\nbonded  by  a  stronger common identity which  they  feel  in\r\n\r\ncommon with those of the other ethnic groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> The MPs have raised points on an important\r\n\r\nsubject.   Our  philosophy has always been to promote  social\r\n\r\nintegration and a common national identity among Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwhile  ensuring  that  each  community  can  retain  its  own\r\n\r\ncultural identity and heritage.  So, we facilitated ways  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to live, learn and socialise in  an  integrated\r\n\r\nenvironment.   We  have  key policies  in  education,  public\r\n\r\nhousing and People's Association programmes as examples which\r\n\r\nhelp  to  maintain  the common space where  Singaporeans  can\r\n\r\ninteract with other races.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, at the same time, we cannot force the pace beyond\r\n\r\nwhat  people  are  comfortable with,  otherwise  it  will  be\r\n\r\ncounter-productive, because each community  wants  to  retain\r\n\r\nits  own identity and to have its own space where members can\r\n\r\ninteract  with  one another, as Mr Sin Boon Ann  says,  their\r\n\r\ncomfort  zone.  And we must also recognise that the  tendency\r\n\r\nfor  different  groups to segregate will  always  be  present\r\n\r\nbecause of different customs and religious requirements.  And\r\n\r\nheightened  religious  consciousness,  strict  observance  of\r\n\r\nrules  of  diet, dress, conduct, particularly among  Muslims,\r\n\r\nhave accentuated this tendency to separateness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present situation, we need to make greater\r\n\r\nefforts to strengthen inter-racial ties, especially among the\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the different communities, so that we  can  deal\r\n\r\nwith any problems which may arise.  And we are actively doing\r\n\r\nthis  through  IRCCs  and  via activities  in  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres  to  reach  out  and bring together  Singaporeans  of\r\n\r\ndifferent races.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-help groups are not the root cause of ethnic\r\n\r\nconsciousness  or  of  the  distance  between  the  different\r\n\r\ncommunities.  They were set up for a specific purpose, ie, to\r\n\r\nhelp  the under-achievers in each community to overcome their\r\n\r\nproblems and uplift themselves, especially educationally,  in\r\n\r\na  way which a multi-racial group will find difficult to  do.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, the self-help groups have done well and will\r\n\r\ncontinue to play a role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the self-help groups do encourage\r\n\r\ntheir  respective  communities to interact  more  with  other\r\n\r\ncommunities.    Often,  they  have  volunteers   from   other\r\n\r\ncommunities  and they collaborate to organise  activities  at\r\n\r\nfestivals  such as Deepavali, Christmas, Hari Raya  Puasa  or\r\n\r\nChinese  New  Year.   These  events help  bring  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntogether  from different ethnic groups and better  understand\r\n\r\nand appreciate each other's values and customs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looking ahead, the self-help groups can do more to\r\n\r\nwork  closely in partnership with one another.  As the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  suggested  last  week, they  should  partner  other\r\n\r\ngroups  and  agencies  to run tuition and  other  programmes,\r\n\r\nrather  than duplicate services.  For example, the  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  are  planning  to organise and run  a  joint  service\r\n\r\ncentre  in Toa Payoh with an integrated management and staff,\r\n\r\nand  cooperating with the CDC and, if this works, we will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  do  it  in  other towns as well.  This  partnership\r\n\r\napproach  will  prevent us from swinging unwittingly  to  the\r\n\r\nundesirable  extreme  which the MPs have  highlighted,  where\r\n\r\nmore  and  more social services and programmes  are  provided\r\n\r\nalong  ethnic  lines.   It  will  also  enable  us  to   pool\r\n\r\nresources,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nminimise duplication and address Mr Inderjit Singh's  concern\r\n\r\nthat  the small self-help groups may be disadvantaged because\r\n\r\nof their limited access to funds and resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also spoke about the need for regular\r\n\r\ninteraction  of  our  school children with  other  races  and\r\n\r\nsuggested twinning of schools where students can do their co-curricular    activities   or   extra-curricular   activities\r\n\r\ntogether.   It  is  an  idea which  is  worth  exploring.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  MUIS, the Madrasahs  and  our  schools  are\r\n\r\nactively  looking on programmes to enable their  students  to\r\n\r\ninteract   with  other  races  and  appreciate  the  national\r\n\r\nperspective.  The Ministry of Education and MCDS  will  study\r\n\r\nto see how we can promote this further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also suggested that the IRCCs be given\r\n\r\na  budget  to  tap on for their activities to promote  racial\r\n\r\ninteraction.  The IRCC is really an extension of the Citizens\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committee.   It is  not  meant  to  be  another\r\n\r\nformalised  and  structured  or  activity-centric  grassroots\r\n\r\ncommittee.    For  a  start,  to  better  understand   ground\r\n\r\nconditions   and  build  rapport  with  the  relevant   local\r\n\r\nestablishments,    many   IRCCs   have   visited    religious\r\n\r\ninstitutions like temples, mosques, churches and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next phase, they could initiate informal\r\n\r\ndialogue and chit-chat sessions with local groups to identify\r\n\r\npressing areas and practical opportunities for building inter-ethnic understanding.  Both the CDCs and the CCCs can finance\r\n\r\nthese  efforts  and the People's Association  will  seek  the\r\n\r\nconcurrence  of the Grassroots Grants Committee  to  increase\r\n\r\nthe   allocation  of  grassroots  grants  to  the  CCCs   for\r\n\r\nactivities promoting racial harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the continual\r\n\r\ninjection  of  talents into the civil service is  crucial  to\r\n\r\nmaintaining a vibrant and dynamic service.  However, the size\r\n\r\nof  the  civil  service is capped to ensure that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nbloated.  My colleague, Mr Inderjit Singh, even called for it\r\n\r\nto  be scaled down by 30%.  Moreover, when a young officer is\r\n\r\nrecruited at an age fresh out of university,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  has a 30-year working life in the service.  With all  the\r\n\r\nscholars we have recruited in the service all these years, it\r\n\r\nis  possible  that we have reached a point where  the  annual\r\n\r\nintake  of  scholars far outnumbers those  retiring  officers\r\n\r\nbased  on  natural  attrition.   Furthermore,  the  terms  of\r\n\r\nservice  are  also  so attractive that few  would  leave  the\r\n\r\ncomfort zone to strike out on their own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in many cases, those who are good in academic\r\n\r\nstudies   make  better  researchers  and  academicians   than\r\n\r\nDivision 1 officers.  To my mind, Sir, it would be better for\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to recruit those with proven abilities  from\r\n\r\nthe  market  and  to  depend less on the scholars.   This  is\r\n\r\nespecially so for those in the elite Administrative  Service.\r\n\r\nAs  regards the scholars that we have already signed  on,  it\r\n\r\nmight be better to assign them to the private sector, such as\r\n\r\nthose in the GLCs, to test them out first.  I understand that\r\n\r\nthere is a programme to attract mid-career officers, but  the\r\n\r\noutcome to date has been quite poor.  May I know what are the\r\n\r\nreasons?  Would the Government review the mid-career  options\r\n\r\nand  renew the emphasis on this?  I believe, with the current\r\n\r\nrecession, it would be a good time to tap the market for mid-career officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zainul Abidin is not here.

Then, they are asked to come back and  serve\r\n\r\nin  the  public service or the Armed Forces with a fast-track\r\n\r\ncareer.  This may have served the public administration,  the\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces and the statutory boards well in the  past  and\r\n\r\nthe  present.   But the time has come for us  to  expand  the\r\n\r\nsystem a little bit further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no longer enough to send out brightest students to\r\n\r\nthese prestigious schools for four years and then get them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto come back to serve.  Will the Government consider allowing\r\n\r\nsome of these scholars, those who are interested and able, to\r\n\r\nsecure  careers  on  their  own  with  the  top  500  Fortune\r\n\r\ncompanies, to allow them to postpone serving their bonds  for\r\n\r\na period of time?  Let them gain work experience in these top\r\n\r\nMNCs,  learn  their  system, adopt their  work  cultures  and\r\n\r\nbenefit  by  dealing with the companies' best and  brightest.\r\n\r\nAfter  five to 10 years, when these scholars are prepared  to\r\n\r\ncome  back  to Singapore, they may be invited back  to  serve\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  any  of the sectors or industries,  public  or\r\n\r\nprivate.  If they do not intend to come to Singapore at  all,\r\n\r\nthen  we  can  exercise the contractual bond and demand  high\r\n\r\ncompensation  for breaking the contract.  This  will  be  our\r\n\r\nbest  form  of international talent that we can  develop  and\r\n\r\ngroom and call our own.  We can be proud if a few of our  top\r\n\r\nscholars are groomed to climb the corporate ladders in  these\r\n\r\ntop MNCs and then come back to serve their duty in Singapore,\r\n\r\nin one of the SMEs or the GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the details and technicalities can be worked\r\n\r\nout if this idea is considered.  I hope the Ministry can take\r\n\r\nsome  of these initiatives to prepare Singapore for long-term\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  I hope the Prime Minister can look  further\r\n\r\nand explore the feasibility of this proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, the Government is an\r\n\r\nenlightened  and  exemplary employer in all  aspects,  except\r\n\r\nwhen  it  comes  to  the medical benefits  scheme  for  civil\r\n\r\nservants.   Under  this scheme, family members  of  a  female\r\n\r\ncivil  servant  are not entitled to medical benefits  in  the\r\n\r\nsame way as those of their male counterparts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, tell me how I can explain to the women, such as our\r\n\r\nSAF  women  regulars and our many top women  civil  servants,\r\n\r\nthat this is a patriarchal society, so just accept it?  Women\r\n\r\nhave  made  great strides over the years.  We  have  a  woman\r\n\r\ncommanding officer in the artillery, and a woman captain of a\r\n\r\nship  in the Navy.  If you are on a ship going to battle,  it\r\n\r\ndoes not matter if you are a man or a woman.  You are on  the\r\n\r\nsame battleship going to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwar,  defending  your country.  The risk is  the  same.   The\r\n\r\nrewards, too, must be equal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told us\r\n\r\nabout the new Medisave scheme for civil servants.  They  have\r\n\r\n$350  worth of outpatient allowance that the men can use  for\r\n\r\ntheir children but the women cannot.  At the end of the year,\r\n\r\nthe  unused  balance goes into their Medisave, which  can  be\r\n\r\nused  to  pay  for their dependants' medical treatment.   So,\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister Lee said it is essentially  the  same.\r\n\r\nBut  it  is not the same.  The distinction found in  the  old\r\n\r\nscheme is still found in the new scheme.  The men can use the\r\n\r\n$350  worth of outpatient allowance for their dependants  and\r\n\r\nthe  women cannot.  In dollar terms, the distinction  may  be\r\n\r\nvery  small but, in symbolic terms, nothing has changed.   It\r\n\r\nis  still  unequal  benefits for equal  work.   It  is  still\r\n\r\nunfair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on Monday, when Deputy Prime Minister Lee extended\r\n\r\nthe  procreation tax rebate to divorcees, he said, \"It is not\r\n\r\na  lot  of  money, but it is a matter of fairness.\"  Exactly.\r\n\r\nThis is also about fairness.  Sir, this policy, whether it is\r\n\r\nthe  old scheme or new, affects a big number of women.  There\r\n\r\nare  33,000 women in the civil service.  That is 54%  of  the\r\n\r\npublic-sector workforce.  But its impact goes far beyond  the\r\n\r\ncivil service.  We know that the private sector looks to  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector  to  set  the tone for society  and  sees  the\r\n\r\nGovernment as a role model for staff and welfare benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to remove this anachronism.\r\n\r\nIt  does  not  do justice to the progress of Singapore  women\r\n\r\nover  the  years, nor to our fine Singapore system which  has\r\n\r\nallowed many women to compete with men on an equal basis.  If\r\n\r\nthe Government still refuses to change this policy, I am sure\r\n\r\nmany  women would appreciate it if the Deputy Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ncan provide a very detailed explanation as to why this policy\r\n\r\nneeds to stay in the national interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in our national interest to involve women\r\n\r\nmore at all levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Ng, I will give you another 30\r\n\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> We cannot tackle all the\r\n\r\nproblems  that  we face, if we do not include  women  in  all\r\n\r\nlevels.

It is lean and efficient.  According to PERC,\r\n\r\nit is ranked the least bureaucratic of the 12 Asian economies\r\n\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service also implements initiatives to improve\r\n\r\nitself,    for   example,   Quality   Service,   ExCEL    and\r\n\r\nOrganisational Review.  There are recent initiatives with  IT\r\n\r\nsuch  as ZIP and \"Innovator Activist\" awards.  Yet there  are\r\n\r\nstill  many  complaints  of bureaucratic  indecisiveness  and\r\n\r\ntardiness.  There  are also complaints of rudeness  and  poor\r\n\r\ncommunication  skills  by frontline  officers  in  explaining\r\n\r\npolicies  clearly.   People wonder if  these  civil  servants\r\n\r\nthink  they are doing taxpayers a favour or they are  serving\r\n\r\nthe taxpayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the administrative system need to change? We\r\n\r\nare   facing  stiff  global  competition,  more  uncertainty,\r\n\r\ngreater information flow and shorter reaction time.  There is\r\n\r\nalso  the  higher  expectation of better  educated  and  more\r\n\r\ndemanding  citizens.  In a globalised environment,  decision-making  has also become more complex.  There are many  angles\r\n\r\nto  a  problem.   Thus,  a  one-size-fits-all  administrative\r\n\r\nstructure and processes are no longer applicable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than sovereignty and security areas, as many areas\r\n\r\nas  possible  could  operate like the private  sector,  where\r\n\r\npossible,  corporatise and privatise the services.   However,\r\n\r\nthe social role, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintegrity and transparency of the civil service should not be\r\n\r\neroded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of change? The civil service needs to change\r\n\r\nin the following areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, be even more customer-focused and strive to\r\n\r\nmeet the needs of the customer.  If we place customers first,\r\n\r\nwe become very responsive to change in market needs, that is,\r\n\r\ncustomers' preferences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote you an example of a cinema industry. We\r\n\r\nused to have large cinemas that could seat a large number  of\r\n\r\npeople. Today, we have cineplexes that give customers greater\r\n\r\nchoice  based  on taste and preferences.  Small cinema  halls\r\n\r\nare both efficient and effective.  If the cinema industry had\r\n\r\nnot made this move, it would have collapsed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the housing industry. A private developer would\r\n\r\nbuild apartments of different sizes to give customers choices\r\n\r\nbased  on  their  principle of supply and  demand.   HDB  can\r\n\r\nconsider doing the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The childcare industry is a good example. It was\r\n\r\nprivatised and is able to provide more choices from community\r\n\r\nchildcare  to upmarket Montessori childcare and  yet  fulfill\r\n\r\nthe Government's social role through subsidy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, compete for effectiveness. We should use\r\n\r\ncompetition  as  a  tool  for  improvement.  When  there   is\r\n\r\ncompetition, there is greater choice. To draw customers,  you\r\n\r\nneed  to  be  efficient and effective in  your  services  and\r\n\r\nproducts  and competitive in price. We should allow services,\r\n\r\ntraditionally  run by the public sector  to  be  run  by  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector, for example, the transport sector.  However,\r\n\r\nwe must bear in mind the affordability of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, build an enterprising culture in a public\r\n\r\norganisation.  The management of public organisations must be\r\n\r\nenterprising  and pro-active in seeking out ways  to  provide\r\n\r\nservices.   The  CEO  can  make quick,  autonomous  decisions\r\n\r\nwithout bureaucratic layers.  For example, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntimely  for  our sports council to be privatised and  provide\r\n\r\ncomprehensive lifestyle services at the sports complexes.  It\r\n\r\ncan  extend  the  scope  of  its involvement  in  the  sports\r\n\r\nbusiness in Singapore. This will impose competition on  small\r\n\r\nand medium sized enterprises.  However, we can invite them to\r\n\r\nwork together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, focus on developing leadership and human\r\n\r\ncapital.   Today,  the  human  factor  has  become  the   key\r\n\r\ningredient for success.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mrs Yu-Foo, could you please complete\r\n\r\nyour speech?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> Yes, Sir. Our civil service must\r\n\r\ncontinue  to develop its people, not only those in leadership\r\n\r\nposition but at all levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to prescribe the number of hours of training\r\n\r\nfor  employees. This may improve their skills, but it is  not\r\n\r\nenough  to create an entrepreneurial team.  How do we  change\r\n\r\nmindsets  to make civil servants more enterprising  and  more\r\n\r\naccountable  for  their actions?  We must  be  more  open  to\r\n\r\nprivate  sector leaders taking up public sector positions  at\r\n\r\nall levels, as my colleague, Dr Wang Wai Kuen also suggested,\r\n\r\nnot  just at the top policy-making level.  I understand  that\r\n\r\nwe tried that before.   We should continue to actively pursue\r\n\r\nthis area.  In many instances, reforms have been initiated --\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Some 5-6 years ago, the Government  tried  to\r\n\r\nrecruit   some  private  sector  executives  to   the   elite\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Service.   However,  as  we  understand,  the\r\n\r\nresponse   was   poor  and  only  a  handful  of   executives\r\n\r\nparticipated  in  the  scheme and,  for  the  few  mid-career\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  talents who had joined  the  civil  service,\r\n\r\nincluding  the high profile, Dr Finian Tan, most have  lasted\r\n\r\nonly about two to three years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a recent article in the Straits Times on 24th April\r\n\r\nsaid that the Public Service Division is indeed embarking  on\r\n\r\na new campaign to woo more private sector talents to join the\r\n\r\ncivil service.  This is good news.  Just last month, the  PSD\r\n\r\nalso  announced  that  its  Administrative  Officers  go   on\r\n\r\nattachment with global consulting firms like McKinsey,  while\r\n\r\nthe  EDB  said  that  they would try to  draw  in  mid-career\r\n\r\nexecutives from the private sector to join its service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past few years, we have also seen the\r\n\r\nGovernment tapping on more and more private sector expertise,\r\n\r\nby getting them to serve on its various committees to provide\r\n\r\ninputs  and  ideas  for  policy formulations.   The  Economic\r\n\r\nReview  Committee and its various sub-committees is one  such\r\n\r\nexample.  Sir, they are all steps in the right direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe Singaporeans are generally supportive of\r\n\r\nthis  idea and in a rapidly changing economy, more new  ideas\r\n\r\nand  a  willingness  to try new ideas  are  required  in  our\r\n\r\nbureaucracy.  Changing  the mindsets  of  civil  servants  is\r\n\r\nequally  important and should be an on-going  process.  Civil\r\n\r\nservants  must  accept  that they  are  not  perfect  and  be\r\n\r\nprepared to admit that certain policies are wrong and correct\r\n\r\nthem  early.   Inducting  private  sector  talents  who  have\r\n\r\nexperienced the harsh realities of the business world outside\r\n\r\nis  an essential part of the process of changing mindset  and\r\n\r\nself-renewal.  Selecting and appointing Ministers from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  private sector have contributed to this idea generation,\r\n\r\nchanging mindsets and implementation process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent batch of our junior Ministers, majority of\r\n\r\nwhom  are  from the private sector, is indeed  a  good  move.\r\n\r\nMore must be done.  Sir, we should be looking forward to  the\r\n\r\nday  when some from among our Permanent Secretaries  will  be\r\n\r\ndrawn from the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to ask the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister whether the Government, drawing on the experience of\r\n\r\nrecent  years, now has a comprehensive plan and, if so,  what\r\n\r\nis  this  plan  to  further achieve this  goal  of  inducting\r\n\r\nprivate sector talents into the civil service, as part of the\r\n\r\noverall  objective and mission of renewing and  strengthening\r\n\r\nthe   civil  service  and  changing  the  mindsets  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, in the context\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore economy, the role of the public sector  is\r\n\r\nextremely  important.   Our  growth  record  is  in  part   a\r\n\r\ntestimony  of  the  high  standards that  our  civil  service\r\n\r\noperates on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as competition heats up on a global scale, it\r\n\r\nis  imperative that the public sector move in tandem with the\r\n\r\nchanging private sector and continually reinvent itself.   In\r\n\r\nthis  regard,  I would like to raise two areas of  importance\r\n\r\nfor the DPM's response - the need to be more customer-focused\r\n\r\nand to improve our inter-agency coordination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, more customer-focused. How does the civil\r\n\r\nservice  internalise  the need to be  more  customer-centric?\r\n\r\nHow  does  it  strive  to  serve the public,  especially  the\r\n\r\nbusiness sector, to have empathy and to be spontaneous  about\r\n\r\nit?   Sir, there is a real need to have substance beyond  the\r\n\r\nmere  form  of  efficiency.   For example,  it  is  extremely\r\n\r\nfrustrating  to suffer the curse of a very politely  recorded\r\n\r\nvoicemail  when  all  you want is some  clarification.   Many\r\n\r\nSMEs,   when   applying  for  assistance  under  the   myriad\r\n\r\nGovernment  schemes,  have recounted experiences  of  dealing\r\n\r\nwith young bureaucratic officers, whose fault\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlies   not   in  the  lack  of  experience,  but   in   their\r\n\r\nunwillingness to listen and understand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, how have working and servicing hours changed?\r\n\r\nWith  most  Singaporeans working longer hours,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nhelpful  if  public  service can be provided  without  people\r\n\r\nhaving to take leave just to attend to personal matters  with\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, inter-agency coordination. Sir, I have had\r\n\r\nfirst-hand experience on this in my private Estate  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme  (EUP)  and I know now that I am not  very  popular\r\n\r\nwith  several agencies.  The greatest challenge  in  the  EUP\r\n\r\nwas,  surprisingly, not in consulting the residents,  nor  in\r\n\r\nthe  design, but in the areas of overlap between two or worse\r\n\r\nstill, more Government agencies.  There was frequently  great\r\n\r\nreluctance  to  take the perspective of the  end-user  or  of\r\n\r\nanother  agency as it may mean having to go the  extra  mile.\r\n\r\nPreserving the status quo appears to rank supreme,  certainly\r\n\r\nwell above customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another occasion, it took my town council almost two\r\n\r\nmonths  to  realise  that  no agency  wanted  to  acknowledge\r\n\r\nownership  of  a  tract  of  land  for  which  residents  had\r\n\r\nrequested  some  lighting.  As we were getting  nowhere,  the\r\n\r\nlamp post went up anyway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the DPM how the civil service\r\n\r\ncan be more customer-centric and how they can be incentivised\r\n\r\nto ensure smooth inter-agency coordination.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, Dr Wang Kai Yuen talked about\r\n\r\nscholars  not necessarily making good Administrative Officers\r\n\r\nand  recommending that we recruit from the market and  depend\r\n\r\nless  on  scholars.  I would agree with him that academically\r\n\r\nable  people  are  not automatically good  managers  or  good\r\n\r\nAdministrative Officers.  When we select scholars, we try our\r\n\r\nbest  to find people who are not only academically good,  but\r\n\r\nhave  something  extra, so that they have a  good  chance  of\r\n\r\nturning  out to be successful Administrative Officers.   Some\r\n\r\ndo, some do not. By\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  large, I think the quality of our civil service  is  not\r\n\r\nbad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do want to have more come in mid-career or from the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector, as Dr Wang Kai Yuen and Mr Chew  Heng  Ching\r\n\r\nsuggested.  We have been quite successful generally  bringing\r\n\r\nin   people  from  different  walks  of  life.   But  in  the\r\n\r\nAdministrative   Service  itself,  we  have   not   been   so\r\n\r\nsuccessful.  We only had a small number come in.  Perhaps, it\r\n\r\nis  because  our  standards are high.  Perhaps,  it  is  also\r\n\r\nbecause  in  the Administrative Service, it is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up,  over  a  long period of time,  knowledge  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, how it works, as well as the culture and the  way\r\n\r\nthe  organisation operates.  That is not easily achieved  for\r\n\r\nsomebody who comes in mid-way, however able and however broad\r\n\r\nhis past experience to do.  It is not a problem unique to the\r\n\r\nSingapore  civil  service.  Many other  civil  services  have\r\n\r\ntried the same - the Australian, New Zealanders and British - and they tell us that they have the same difficulties. But we\r\n\r\nwill continue trying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for seconding Administrative Officers to companies,\r\n\r\nwe  do  that.  Yesterday, we were criticised for  doing  that\r\n\r\nwith  the GLCs.  We do not just do it with the GLCs. What  we\r\n\r\ntry  to do is to attach them to companies like Shell or  even\r\n\r\nmanagement  consultant  companies,  like  McKinsey  or  other\r\n\r\ninstitutions  where they can learn something  and  come  back\r\n\r\nwith a different perspective, and know what it is like to  be\r\n\r\non  the receiving end of a directive or instruction, and also\r\n\r\nto  know what it is like to have a bottom-line responsibility\r\n\r\nand  be  more  profit-focused, when they come back  into  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service.  In the private sector, time  is  money.   To\r\n\r\nyou,  it  is two weeks to write a paper; to them, it  is  two\r\n\r\nweeks'  worth  of  salaries and overheads.   We  do  want  to\r\n\r\nencourage this further and we are trying hard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia suggested allowing scholars to serve their\r\n\r\nscholarship bonds for five or ten years with the Fortune  500\r\n\r\ncompanies.   I  think this is difficult  to  do  because  the\r\n\r\nfundamental  motive of Government scholarships is  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat the public sector gets its fair share of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalent  to  contribute to the development of  Singapore  and,\r\n\r\nparticularly,  for  places  where you  cannot  readily  bring\r\n\r\npeople  in  from  the private sector, off the  streets.   You\r\n\r\nthink  about  the  SAF, which needs SAF scholars,  you  think\r\n\r\nabout  the  Singapore Police Force, they need  SPF  scholars.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  think  about  the  Administrative  Service,  as   I\r\n\r\nexplained  just now, it does not find it so easy  to  recruit\r\n\r\npeople at mid-career and to fit in.  If we work on the  basis\r\n\r\nof  giving people scholarships, then they go off and do their\r\n\r\nown things for 10 years and they start their careers with the\r\n\r\ncivil service, maybe in their mid-30s, I think we have lost a\r\n\r\ngood  part of his working life, where not only should  he  be\r\n\r\ncontributing to us, but he should also be learning about  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Singapore and imbibing values  and  knowledge\r\n\r\nwhich  would stand him in good stead over the long term.   We\r\n\r\ncannot  do  this to everybody, but we hope to do  it  with  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  proportion of our people.   There  is  no  model\r\n\r\nanywhere in the world where the civil service depends  mainly\r\n\r\non  people  who join in mid-career.  There will be  some  who\r\n\r\njoin in mid-career but not everybody.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Irene Ng raised again the question of medical\r\n\r\nbenefits.  As I have explained yesterday, and as she recapped\r\n\r\nfor  Members,  indeed the practical difference  for  the  new\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits scheme - Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient\r\n\r\nScheme,  MSO  - is really very small.  But the difference  is\r\n\r\none of principle.  So I think she will appreciate it if I  am\r\n\r\ndirect  and honest and explain what the principle was,  which\r\n\r\nled  us to where we are today.  And the principle is, as  she\r\n\r\nhas put it, one of basic social philosophy.  Because this  is\r\n\r\nan  Asian  society, and in an Asian society  the  husband  is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  taking care of the  family,  including  the\r\n\r\nmedical  expenses.   Our  medical  benefits  schemes   should\r\n\r\nreflect  this  and  should not undermine  the  rationale  for\r\n\r\nholding the husband responsible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All MPs, even new ones, I am sure, have met constituents\r\n\r\nat MPS sessions, where\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  husband  has  deserted  the  family  and  abandoned  his\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  and the wife comes with young  children  to\r\n\r\nseek  help.   We  seldom, not never, meet a  husband  seeking\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance because his wife had left him.  It is  a\r\n\r\nreality  of  our society.  So we have no immediate  plans  to\r\n\r\nchange  the  medical  benefits schemes but,  like  all  other\r\n\r\nGovernment policies, this one is not set in stone either.  As\r\n\r\nour  society evolves, we will review it periodically  and  as\r\n\r\nMembers know, in our new scheme we have already substantially\r\n\r\nnarrowed the difference, although not to the satisfaction  of\r\n\r\nall Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that many MPs, especially the female MPs, feel\r\n\r\nthat  times  have  already changed and  that  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  set  the lead in establishing new social norms.   The\r\n\r\nfact  that some male MPs supported them is some evidence that\r\n\r\nperhaps  times are beginning to change.  But the Government's\r\n\r\nview is that on a matter as basic as the family structure, we\r\n\r\nshould  follow, rather than lead social changes.   So  it  is\r\n\r\nsomething which we will review, but for now I think  we  will\r\n\r\nleave the status quo be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a National Women's Council which Miss Irene Ng\r\n\r\nalso  suggested,  I  am not sure whether  this  is  necessary\r\n\r\nbecause  we  already  have  a Singapore  Council  of  Women's\r\n\r\nOrganisation,  which is an umbrella body for women's  groups.\r\n\r\nThe  Youth  Council is not really meant as  an  advocate  for\r\n\r\nyouths  but  really has a developmental role,  which  is  not\r\n\r\nquite  a  similar situation as the women are in, because  the\r\n\r\nwomen are really adult members of society.  In Singapore, our\r\n\r\nprinciple  and practice of meritocracy is the best  assurance\r\n\r\nfor the increasingly full and equal participation of women in\r\n\r\nall  walks  of  life,  especially in  our  education  system,\r\n\r\nproviding  Singapore  women  the opportunity  to  participate\r\n\r\nfully in all aspects of life in Singapore.  So I am not  sure\r\n\r\nthat we need a council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo asked about customer-focused inter-agency\r\n\r\ncoordination,  improving  the  public  service,  points  also\r\n\r\nraised by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.  I agree with both of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem.   Already,  we have been trying our best  to  privatise\r\n\r\nGovernment services so as to subject them to competition  and\r\n\r\ncause  them to operate more efficiently and competently.   We\r\n\r\nhave  to  study each of these privatisations specifically  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that it will work because, as Mrs Yu-Foo  pointed\r\n\r\nout,  the  key role of the public sector is the provision  of\r\n\r\npublic  goods and services and also you have to  worry  about\r\n\r\nsocial  objectives and these cannot be left entirely  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector to provide, especially public  education  and\r\n\r\npublic  safety and security.  But in many other areas  it  is\r\n\r\npossible to depend much more on the private sector and we are\r\n\r\ndoing so through various programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Government itself, we are also trying to\r\n\r\nimprove  the quality of the service we provide, which despite\r\n\r\nour  best efforts, sometimes it is frustrating to the public,\r\n\r\neven  to  well-informed, knowledgeable members of the public,\r\n\r\nand  even  to members of the public who have ready access  to\r\n\r\nMPs.   When you have to deal with departments, sometimes  you\r\n\r\nfind  they  are not as flexible as you would like it  to  be.\r\n\r\nThere  are  times  when there is reason  why  the  department\r\n\r\ncannot  be  flexible, but there are other times when  a  more\r\n\r\npractical  approach,  a  more sympathetic  and  understanding\r\n\r\napproach   would   have   helped  to   solve   the   problems\r\n\r\nexpeditiously.   So we have things like PS21 (Public  Service\r\n\r\nfor  the  21st  Century) and MFE (Managing  For  Excellence).\r\n\r\nThey are buzzwords, but they are also specific programmes and\r\n\r\nactivities which remind civil servants that it is  their  job\r\n\r\nboth to be civil and also to be servants of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have mechanism to coordinate inter-agency which,\r\n\r\nas Mrs Lim Hwee Hua pointed out, is one of the most difficult\r\n\r\nthings  to  do.   When two agencies are responsible  for  one\r\n\r\nproblem,  their  complexities doubled, when  three  agencies,\r\n\r\neach  have some jurisdiction, it becomes quadrupled.   So  we\r\n\r\nneed  some way to tie up and make sure nothing falls  between\r\n\r\nthe  cracks and, furthermore, where there is overlap,  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  gridlock.  We have mechanisms like this, where  we\r\n\r\nhave got lead agencies which take on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncoordinating  roles, and work with other  agencies,  so  they\r\n\r\nprovide  a point of contact to the public, you deal with  one\r\n\r\nand  he  would  manage  the  complexity.   For  example,  the\r\n\r\nBuilding  and Construction Authority coordinates the approval\r\n\r\nof  building  plans that involve various Government  agencies\r\n\r\nand we should work to improve such inter-agency coordination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody told me if you want to start a pub in Singapore\r\n\r\nyou  need  a  dozen different permits from a dozen  different\r\n\r\nagencies,  which  drives you round the bend.   I  have  never\r\n\r\nstarted  a  pub but I take him at his words and I suppose  we\r\n\r\nshould start a project to see whether -----\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We have a one-stop centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We can improve. We already have a\r\n\r\nprogramme called ZIP (Zero in Process) which we introduced in\r\n\r\nOctober  2000, which aims to reduce the number  of  instances\r\n\r\nwhere the public has to go separately to various agencies for\r\n\r\nrelated  Government service.  So if you have, for example,  a\r\n\r\nfeedback on noise pollution, refer to ENV and they would deal\r\n\r\nwith  all  the  parties.   If  you have  problems  concerning\r\n\r\nmaintenance of roads, street fixtures, street lightings which\r\n\r\nneed  fixing - Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, if you have another  problem\r\n\r\nwith   street  lightings,  please  refer  them  to  the  Land\r\n\r\nTransport  Authority  - and if you do not  get  satisfaction,\r\n\r\nplease come and let us know.  We have a list of lead agencies\r\n\r\nand  a  ZIP website (www.zip.gov.sg) and if you have feedback\r\n\r\nfor  the  ZIP  secretariat you can give  the  inputs  at  the\r\n\r\nwebsite  or call PSD.  We are committed to improving service.\r\n\r\nWe  are not quite satisfied with what we have achieved and we\r\n\r\nwill try our best to do better.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> The General Election is a\r\n\r\nspecial time, once every five years, where citizens come  and\r\n\r\ngive  their votes of support or disapproval to the  governing\r\n\r\nparty  and  its  elected representatives in Parliament.   The\r\n\r\ntrue  test  of democracy is a free and fair general  election\r\n\r\nheld at fixed intervals.  In the long term interest of nation\r\n\r\nbuilding, can the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister explain, if he truly believes  in  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  principle of elections, why  are  there  so  many\r\n\r\nchanges and adjustments to the electoral process aimed mainly\r\n\r\nat  keeping the Opposition at bay and maintaining  the  power\r\n\r\nand presence of the ruling party?  While we do not expect the\r\n\r\nruling  party to help the Opposition to win the election,  we\r\n\r\ncan only hope that the electoral process could be fairer.  In\r\n\r\nthis  regard,  I hope the Prime Minister can  look  into  the\r\n\r\nfollowing proposals to make the general elections fairer:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Allow at least six months after the release of the\r\n\r\nElectoral   Boundaries  Committee  Report  before  dissolving\r\n\r\nParliament.   It would be equally fair to the incumbents  and\r\n\r\ninterested contestants to review the new constituency;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Reduce the number and size of each GRC to a maximum of\r\n\r\n11 and four candidates per GRC, respectively.  Introduce back\r\n\r\nmore single member constituencies so that more citizens will\r\n\r\nhave a chance to exercise their votes;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Do not misuse national resources as a tool for political\r\n\r\nsupport.  Linking upgrading to voter support is abuse of the\r\n\r\npeople's trust; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Finally, I hope the Minister can also look into setting\r\n\r\nup a media watch committee to look into the matter of unfair\r\n\r\nmedia coverage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By being open and playing fair, the Government will be\r\n\r\nable to win more of the people's trust and support.  There is\r\n\r\nno  need to be kiasu and kiasee and use all attempts to  stop\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition from gaining a foothold into Parliament.  The\r\n\r\nelectorate is now mature enough to differentiate between  the\r\n\r\nbetter  candidates.  Can the Deputy Prime Minister  learn  to\r\n\r\ntrust the people more?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now go on to my next cut on the Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment.   The Elections Department conducts the  election\r\n\r\nprocess and produces the Electoral Boundaries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee  Report  before every election is  held.   Can  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister  explain how some  of  the  electoral\r\n\r\nboundaries  are  redrawn?  Specifically, can he  explain  how\r\n\r\nBraddell  Heights, which is near the centre of Singapore,  in\r\n\r\nSerangoon, be redrawn into Marine Parade GRC, which is at the\r\n\r\nEast  Coast?  Can the Deputy Prime Minister also  explain  on\r\n\r\nwhat  basis did the Prime Minister convince the President  to\r\n\r\ndissolve  Parliament  a  day after the  Electoral  Boundaries\r\n\r\nCommittee  Report  was released?  Did  he  not  have  special\r\n\r\nprivileged  information used to his  Party's  advantage?   Is\r\n\r\nthere  a  case of an abuse of power?  The Prime  Minister  is\r\n\r\nalso  the  Secretary-General of the  ruling  party.   As  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the PAP, it is his duty to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nhis  party  candidates  win  in  as  many  constituencies  as\r\n\r\npossible.  Thus, is there a conflict of interest or is  there\r\n\r\nnot   a  conflict  of  interest  and  duty  by  placing   the\r\n\r\njurisdiction of the Elections Department under the control of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister's Office?  Can the Prime Minister explain\r\n\r\nwhat  due  process  did he use to ensure  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nconflict  between  his  obligation to  the  nation  as  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and as Secretary-General of his party?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, is it not better and safer for the Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  be  under  the jurisdiction  of  the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresident  or  some independent commission?   Can  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister kindly explain this matter?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, out-of-bounds markers. Many people have spoken\r\n\r\nout  about OB markers in the past.  They had argued  that  OB\r\n\r\nmarkers are vague, lacking clarity and creating confusion for\r\n\r\nactive  citizens  who  want  to  participate  in  the  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding process.  Some of them have also asked that  the  OB\r\n\r\nmarkers  be spelt out and be clear so that it can be avoided.\r\n\r\nI  want  to  ask the Prime Minster if he had  a  list  of  OB\r\n\r\nmarkers  ready for public release.  If citizens have to  keep\r\n\r\nwondering  what  they say is going to  step  on  any  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  toe and thus out-of-bound, then soon  the  active\r\n\r\nand  concerned citizens will learn not to say anything.  They\r\n\r\nwill  just  shut  up and shut out.  They  will  learn  to  be\r\n\r\nbochap.  It is safer to adopt this bochap attitude.  Do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  bother to listen to the Government, no need to disagree,\r\n\r\nno  disagreement,  no need to speak up, no fear  of  stepping\r\n\r\nonto  the  OB  markers, therefore, no fear of  offending  the\r\n\r\nMinisters.  Life remains peaceful and calm.  How  good.   But\r\n\r\nthe  fact that this bochap attitude is developing is worrying\r\n\r\nand bad for our society.  Where there is no exchange of ideas\r\n\r\nit  is  bad for the society.  Our citizens must be encouraged\r\n\r\nto  speak  up  without fear.  We must allow them  to  express\r\n\r\nthemselves  and learn to take responsibility  for  what  they\r\n\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no OB markers in parliamentary debates then\r\n\r\nthere should be no OB markers at all in our society.  Once we\r\n\r\ngo  into  the  political arena we must expect  criticism  and\r\n\r\nunfair  condemnations.   If we can defend  ourselves  in  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary debates, I think we should have  the  grace  to\r\n\r\ndefend these criticisms in public.  I hope the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ncan  clarify on the list of out-of-bounds markers, and remove\r\n\r\nthis requirement from our society totally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will move on to touch on youths in politics.\r\n\r\nThe  Prime  Minister had ever said that entering politics  is\r\n\r\nthe  highest  form of public service.   There had  also  been\r\n\r\nlaments from some Ministers that there are not enough  youths\r\n\r\nwho  are  interested  in  politics.   Politics  is  the  most\r\n\r\nuncertain  of  careers  -  both for the PAP as  well  as  for\r\n\r\nOpposition politicians.  Therefore, it is not surprising that\r\n\r\nyoung professional Singaporeans are not interested to go into\r\n\r\npolitics at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is making matters worse is that there is only one\r\n\r\ncompany,  one party or one cruise liner to go  to   if  these\r\n\r\nyoung  professionals are interested to  make  politics  as  a\r\n\r\ncareer,  ie, to join the PAP.  Joining the PAP is like  going\r\n\r\non  board  a  luxury cruise liner  -  very  big,  strong  and\r\n\r\nstable.   No  risks  and no worries of a  capsize.   Full  of\r\n\r\nluxury,  joy  and  entertainment, it is no wonder  that  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   -   good and bad, qualified  or  not   -   are\r\n\r\nrushing on board to join this PAP cruise liner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for those with a different perspective, who do not\r\n\r\nlike the trappings,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  style,  the  direction or the destination  of  this  PAP\r\n\r\ncruise  liner,  they have no other ship or  liner  to  board.\r\n\r\nThey  can  only  consider the rickety sampans  that  we,  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  have  to  offer.  But it is  full  of  risk  and\r\n\r\ndanger.  A storm may arise and we may have a shipwreck.  Or a\r\n\r\nbig  fish may jump out from nowhere and swallow us, never  to\r\n\r\nbe seen again for the next 30 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever it is, the PAP cruise liner has made it risky\r\n\r\nfor  young  idealistic Singapore professionals  to  join  the\r\n\r\nsmall sampans.  They have no choice but to stay on shore  and\r\n\r\nforget   about  their  ideals  of  helping  to  explore   new\r\n\r\nopportunities  and  claiming new grounds for  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many young Singaporeans are foolish like myself to\r\n\r\nchallenge  this  giant  Goliath.   Before  the  last  General\r\n\r\nElections, all my friends and family members thought that  it\r\n\r\nwas  suicidal or crazy to go into Opposition politics.   They\r\n\r\ndo  not see a future.  They do not see a hope.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nhope of reaching shore with this sampan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if the Prime Minister is sincere in wanting to\r\n\r\nencourage  more  young Singaporeans to  enter  politics,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment must first calm the sea and play fair.  Allow  the\r\n\r\nsampan  to  find  shore and grow hope.  Only when  the  first\r\n\r\nbatches of adventurers had safely crossed the Atlantic  Ocean\r\n\r\nwill  it  give hope to other great idealists.  Therefore,  if\r\n\r\nthe  Government wants youths to be interested in politics and\r\n\r\nto serve the country in the highest office, then we must have\r\n\r\nhope,  opportunity and freedom to choose which boat to board.\r\n\r\nAs  the  Prime  Minister's task is to look at  the  long-term\r\n\r\ninterest of the country, can we expect the Government to play\r\n\r\nfair and give hope to all?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, you can take your two cuts\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing me to take one cut after the other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first topic is on the recognition of the Opposition.\r\n\r\nThis is not a new topic.  As far\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  I  am  concerned,  I have spoken on this  many  times  in\r\n\r\nParliament.  The Government has torn down the office that was\r\n\r\nbuilt  for my use as a Member of Parliament at Potong  Pasir,\r\n\r\nand  has  never  rebuilt it since.  On the part  of  the  PAP\r\n\r\ncandidate  at the constituency, he is given an airconditioned\r\n\r\nroom  where he can conduct his political business in  comfort\r\n\r\nand  utter  privacy.  I have now to meet my residents  during\r\n\r\nthe meet-the-people sessions in an open void deck space which\r\n\r\nis not very suitable, because residents often want to consult\r\n\r\nme  on  very  personal  matters and they  do  not  feel  very\r\n\r\ncomfortable, as they do not have any privacy at all.   I have\r\n\r\nspoken on this matter and, in this respect, I said that I  am\r\n\r\ntreated  no different from a roadside fortune teller  when  I\r\n\r\nmeet my residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Prime Minister can direct the HDB to\r\n\r\nrestore  my MP's office at the void deck at Potong  Pasir  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as  possible.  The Government should  not  discriminate\r\n\r\nagainst  me  as  an Opposition Member.  All  PAP  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament are each given, I believe, a room to work  in  the\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  Why am I, as an Opposition MP,  not provided\r\n\r\nwith the same facilities?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the constituency level, the Government recognises the\r\n\r\nbeaten PAP candidate at Potong Pasir more than me who has won\r\n\r\nat  the  last  general election.  The PAP candidate  was  not\r\n\r\nchosen  by the majority of the Potong Pasir residents.   Yet,\r\n\r\nhe appears to have more authority than me, the elected MP.  I\r\n\r\nhave  to apply to him, whom I have defeated at the elections,\r\n\r\nfor  funds  for community projects and for any other  matters\r\n\r\nthat  require  the  support  of the  CCC.   All  because  the\r\n\r\ndefeated PAP candidate is made the Advisor to the CCC and  I,\r\n\r\nthe MP for that constituency, has been left out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that the Government cannot take defeat.\r\n\r\nAlthough the PAP candidate has lost at Potong Pasir, the  way\r\n\r\nthat constituency is run is based on the premise that the PAP\r\n\r\ncandidate has won at Potong Pasir in the last election.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeaten  PAP  candidate is made the Advisor to the CCC,  CCMC,\r\n\r\nRCs   and   other  grassroots  organisations,   whereas   the\r\n\r\nOpposition MP there is treated as if he does not exist.  That\r\n\r\nis  why  I  am  making  another call  to  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  the Opposition MP at Potong Pasir as a  legitimate\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the people at Potong Pasir, and not someone\r\n\r\nelse.   If  the Government really wants to remake  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthen  it  must  uphold the democratic system,  recognise  all\r\n\r\nelected representatives of the people to Parliament, and  not\r\n\r\nonly elected PAP representatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall go on to the next cut and I will speak on\r\n\r\nNCMP   honorarium.   My  speech  will  be  confined  to   the\r\n\r\nhonorarium or allowance given to NCMP, and not to NMP,  which\r\n\r\nI  do  not support.  I understand from my colleague, Mr Steve\r\n\r\nChia,  that  the allowance given to NCMP is only 15%  of  the\r\n\r\nelected  MP's  allowance.   I must  say  that  such  a  small\r\n\r\nallowance is derisory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCMPs are different from NMPs on the following important\r\n\r\npoints:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) NCMPs, unlike NMPs, have taken part in elections,\r\n\r\nwhereas   the   NMPs   have   no  electoral   experience   or\r\n\r\nparticipation at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) As a result of taking part in elections, NCMPs have\r\n\r\nwon a certain number of votes and they do represent those who\r\n\r\nvoted  for them when they are in Parliament, whereas NMPs  do\r\n\r\nnot  represent  anyone at all when they  are  in  Parliament,\r\n\r\nexcept themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCMPs are chosen from amongst the Opposition candidates\r\n\r\nwho  have  won the most votes or the best losers among  them.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Mr Steve Chia, I believe he had garnered about\r\n\r\n35%  of the total votes cast, and I must say that winning 35%\r\n\r\nof  the votes cast is a respectable achievement.  I can  tell\r\n\r\nyou  that  it  is not so easy for an Opposition candidate  to\r\n\r\nwrest  35%  of the votes from a PAP candidate.  To a  certain\r\n\r\nextent,  one can say that Mr Steve Chia has won his place  in\r\n\r\nParliament with 35% representation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries where they have proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation, one can get elected into Parliament with only\r\n\r\n5%  of  the  total votes cast.  Although we do not have  that\r\n\r\nsystem  in  Singapore, we do have a system  where  NCMPs  are\r\n\r\nappointed to Parliament.  Mr Steve Chia need not be defensive\r\n\r\nabout  his  appointment to Parliament.   His  appointment  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  with  merit.  He does represent  quite  a  sizable\r\n\r\nnumber of people at Chua Chu Kang.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his remuneration, I think if a poll were to\r\n\r\nbe  taken  at Chua Chu Kang, I would think that  35%  of  the\r\n\r\nvoters who voted for him would certainly want their NCMP,  Mr\r\n\r\nSteve  Chia,  to  be  adequately  paid.   They  would  surely\r\n\r\nconsider   the   person   they  voted   can   make   valuable\r\n\r\ncontributions  to Parliament and to the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  should  be  properly rewarded.   Mr  Steve  Chia  is  no\r\n\r\nlaggard.  He  is hardworking.   He has filed, I  believe,  24\r\n\r\ncuts in this year's budget debate.  I think this is more than\r\n\r\nmany of the older MPs, including myself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I suggest that in order to give proper\r\n\r\nrecognition and respect to NCMPs, their allowance  should  be\r\n\r\nraised from 15% to at least 50% of an elected MP's allowance?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Steve Chia, you can take your two cuts\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Mr\r\n\r\nChiam, for speaking up for me\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Senior Minister had once said, \"If you pay\r\n\r\npeanuts,  you  will get monkeys.\"  I agree  with  the  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister on this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, the House had a passionate debate on NMPs\r\n\r\nand  voted strongly to have them in this House.  It had  been\r\n\r\nsaid  that NMPs were very good and had contributed a  lot  of\r\n\r\ngood debate to this House.  I was not here then, but I do not\r\n\r\ndeny that they contributed a lot.  I think NMPs had helped to\r\n\r\nliven  up debates in the past, but I went to argue that there\r\n\r\nwas no need for them in this session of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis House, because the PAP Government was freeing up its MPs\r\n\r\nfor more debates and disagreements, and this would help solve\r\n\r\nthe  cynicism and scepticism in youths.  It was not  listened\r\n\r\nto and I was out-voted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we are going to get NMPs in this House, I would\r\n\r\nwant  to speak up for them too.  I think we should give  them\r\n\r\ntheir due recognition.  The honorarium of an NMP is at 15% of\r\n\r\nan  elected MP's allowance.   This is too little.   Like  all\r\n\r\nMPs,  they  have  the  duty to speak up and  engage  in  good\r\n\r\ndebates.   We  should therefore recognise their  contribution\r\n\r\nand  pay  them an NMP allowance equivalent to 40% or more  of\r\n\r\nthe elected MP's allowance, instead of a small honorarium  of\r\n\r\njust 15%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the NCMP's honorarium, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\ndeclare my personal direct interest in this matter.  An  NCMP\r\n\r\nis  not  quite, but is close to a political appointment.   We\r\n\r\nknow  that when the PAP Government wins all the seats,  there\r\n\r\nwill be at least three such NCMP appointments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our role, as NCMPs, is as heavy as an elected MP. We\r\n\r\nare  not  only expected to be robust and vigorous in speaking\r\n\r\nup  in  Parliament and contributing to good debates.  We  are\r\n\r\nalso   contributing  to  nation  building   by   giving   the\r\n\r\nperspective of the non-PAP voters which number about  10-30%,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  which  election.  This is  important  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that takes pride in caring for all its people.  On\r\n\r\ntop of speaking in Parliament, the Non-Constituency Member of\r\n\r\nParliament  has to cover as many electoral constituencies  as\r\n\r\npossible  and  get  the  feeling  and  understanding  of  the\r\n\r\ncitizens,  especially  of those who  are  not  supportive  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  policies.  We have to understand their grievances\r\n\r\nand  raise  them  in Parliament.  Like all the  elected  MPs,\r\n\r\nconstituency  work is to build rapport and support  with  the\r\n\r\nelectorate for the next election.  This is the same  duty  as\r\n\r\nany of the elected MPs.  Therefore, I hope the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwill  agree with my above reasoning and look into reinstating\r\n\r\nthe NCMP allowance to be on par with all the elected MPs,  as\r\n\r\nit was first crafted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next cut is on legislative and secretarial assistance\r\n\r\nfor NMP and NCMP.\r\n\r\nSir,  I would like to state my direct interest in this matter\r\n\r\nagain.   Like  all  MPs,  NMPs and  NCMPs  are  invited  into\r\n\r\nParliament  to represent a different viewpoint from  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment.  They are expected to speak up with sound advice,\r\n\r\nresearch  and argument, to raise issues and discuss  policies\r\n\r\nand  contribute to parliamentary debate.  Therefore, will the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister also agree with me that it is  necessary  for\r\n\r\nNMPs  and  NCMPs  to  be  given legislative  and  secretarial\r\n\r\nallowance  to employ help?  Does the House not want  to  hear\r\n\r\nmore  contributions and more in-depth debates from these NMPs\r\n\r\nand NCMPs?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs and Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, on behalf of the Prime Minister, I\r\n\r\nwill  take  these  few  cuts raised  by  the  two  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first question of General Election, Mr Chia asked\r\n\r\nwhy  are  there so many changes to electoral laws  that  have\r\n\r\nimpeded the Opposition.  I am not sure what electoral laws or\r\n\r\nregulations  that have impeded the Opposition, because  these\r\n\r\nsame  laws,  regulations  and provisions  apply  to  all  the\r\n\r\ncandidates during an election, regardless of whether it is an\r\n\r\nOpposition, a PAP or an independent candidate.  So, I am  not\r\n\r\nable  to  answer  fully his question on the  laws  that  have\r\n\r\nimpeded  the  Opposition.   But he has  made  several  points\r\n\r\nconcerning   electoral  boundary,  the  Electoral  Boundaries\r\n\r\nReview Committee Report and GRCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained not long ago in this Chamber why the\r\n\r\nElectoral  Boundaries Review Committee Report  was  published\r\n\r\nand  that  not  long after that, an election was  called.   I\r\n\r\nthink  those circumstances may not repeat themselves.   There\r\n\r\nwere  instances in the past where the Boundaries  Report  was\r\n\r\nreleased and there was adequate time for people to look at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  changes.   But  Opposition or PAP MPs  should  not  just\r\n\r\ndepend  on the publication of the Electoral Boundaries Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  Report  to  conduct their electoral  or  political\r\n\r\nwork.   I  know that Opposition parties and their  supporters\r\n\r\nhave gone round from time to time to different constituencies\r\n\r\nto understand the ground, survey the ground, feel the ground,\r\n\r\nand  see to what extent the people there warm up to them,  or\r\n\r\nin what areas where the PAP constituencies may appear to have\r\n\r\nsome weaknesses and problems, and therefore take advantage of\r\n\r\nthem  and contest in those constituencies.  So, if Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers  do some home work, put their ears to the ground  and\r\n\r\nbe  more  hardworking,  instead of waiting  till  nearer  the\r\n\r\nelection,  or  when the election dates are  known,  to  start\r\n\r\nworking  the  ground in the constituency, they  may  stand  a\r\n\r\nbetter  chance.   That  is one of the  ways  which  they  can\r\n\r\nconsider, although it is not my duty to teach them how to win\r\n\r\nan  election.  No government party sets itself out  to  teach\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition how to win elections.  And like  every  other\r\n\r\ncountry, it is the incumbent governing party that decides  on\r\n\r\nmany  of  the issues.  Of course, when it comes to the  vote,\r\n\r\nthe  people  will eventually have to decide which party  will\r\n\r\ngive  them  the stability, the progress, and the  quality  of\r\n\r\nlife that they are all looking for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GRC situation is the same, as I described not long\r\n\r\nago  in this House.  The question was raised by Mr Chiam: Why\r\n\r\ndo we have GRCs?  We have tried to give as many opportunities\r\n\r\nas  possible,  but  the  Constitution and  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nElections  Act  state the number of GRCs and  the  number  of\r\n\r\nsingle  constituencies  that can  be  allowed  in  a  general\r\n\r\nelection.   So long as these rules are followed, we  are  all\r\n\r\nwithin  the  law.  Whether it is fair or not, I think  it  is\r\n\r\nfair to everyone who wants to contest.  It does not mean  the\r\n\r\nbigger  GRC or more GRCs will favour the PAP.  It also  could\r\n\r\nmean  that if the PAP Members do not do their work, they  can\r\n\r\nlose a significant number of seats in Parliament, and that is\r\n\r\nthe  risk that we have weighed, and we have decided  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  do  our  job,  make sure that we continue  to  get  the\r\n\r\npeople's support, and we are prepared to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake this risk.  But if the Opposition can do a better job, I\r\n\r\nam  sure  the  people will support them and  return  them  in\r\n\r\nlarger numbers than what they have been doing in the last 13-14 years since we have the GRC system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the media watch, it is not the Opposition candidates\r\n\r\nalone  that  complained about the coverage of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nduring   the  General  Election  or  at  other  times.    PAP\r\n\r\ncandidates and MPs also complained that they did not  receive\r\n\r\nenough  coverage.  If we look at the number of  PAP  Members,\r\n\r\nhow  many of them appeared regularly in the press?  During  a\r\n\r\nparliamentary  debate, if they said something interesting  or\r\n\r\nspoke  on topics of significance, the media, generally,  will\r\n\r\nsimply  have a very brief summary of what they said, although\r\n\r\nthey  have made a speech lasting many minutes.  So,  if  they\r\n\r\nwant  to  appear  in  the media, then  make  sure  they  have\r\n\r\nsomething that is newsworthy for the newspapers to report for\r\n\r\nthe  public, which the public has an interest, to  read  what\r\n\r\nthey have said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the election, I think the media has given a\r\n\r\nbalanced  coverage  to the Opposition.   The  Opposition  has\r\n\r\naccess  to  the media just as the PAP has.  And if they  have\r\n\r\nsomething  of  importance  - maybe an  announcement  or  some\r\n\r\nexciting  programme, or a good rally speech - I am  sure  the\r\n\r\nmedia  will  be  interested  to  report  it.   For  the   PAP\r\n\r\ncandidates,  I  think there are far more PAP candidates  than\r\n\r\nthere  are Opposition candidates during any General Election.\r\n\r\nDuring  the period of campaigning, PAP candidates had  always\r\n\r\ncomplained  to  me  -  because I  helped  in  organising  the\r\n\r\nelection  -  that they did not receive enough  coverage.    I\r\n\r\nwould  just  say to them, \"If you have something interesting,\r\n\r\nif you have an exciting programme, or it will be a good visit\r\n\r\nto  somewhere that will be of interest to the press, they may\r\n\r\ncover you.  If not, just leave things be.\"  They will have to\r\n\r\nwork  their ground to convince the voters, not just the media\r\n\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Mr Chia's comment on linking political\r\n\r\nsupport  to infrastructure or upgrading projects,  these  are\r\n\r\nour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   People  will elect the Party  that  will  bring\r\n\r\nthese programmes.  When we are returned to power, we keep our\r\n\r\npromises.   That is the way it is done in many parts  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.   In most democratic societies - in America,  Britain,\r\n\r\nand  anywhere else he can name - I am sure he will  find  the\r\n\r\nsame  things being done.  There is nothing wrong  with  that.\r\n\r\nBecause if a party that is contesting an election cannot keep\r\n\r\nits  promise and does not have good programmes, then it  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  returned  to power.  So if the Opposition  has  good\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  can  convince the people,  and  be  returned  to\r\n\r\ngovern,  they  can  carry  out what they  have  promised  the\r\n\r\nelectorate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Elections Department under the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  Office  (PMO),  and  the  Boundaries  Report,  in\r\n\r\nparticular  the  Electoral Boundaries Review  Committee,  how\r\n\r\nthey  arrived at the decision, they must have some basis  for\r\n\r\ndoing so.  As for Braddell Heights in Marine Parade, this has\r\n\r\nbeen asked before.  If Mr Chia reads up the Hansard, he might\r\n\r\nhave  found an explanation there.  There may be a reason  why\r\n\r\nthe Electoral Boundaries Review Committee had decided to draw\r\n\r\nthe  boundaries  that way, just as they decided  why  certain\r\n\r\nconstituencies should be single-member constituencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Prime Minister influence the electoral process?\r\n\r\nThe  Prime  Minister  is  the person who  recommends  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident  to dissolve Parliament, and that is the  executive\r\n\r\npower  as  provided  for  in the Constitution.   Every  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  does it.  Not just in Singapore, but also in  other\r\n\r\nparts  of the world.  That situation has worked well, and  it\r\n\r\nwill remain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will transferring the Elections Department to the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Office  make  any difference?   The  President's\r\n\r\nOffice   -   do not forget the President himself is  also  an\r\n\r\nelected  President  -   is also an elected  office  too.   So\r\n\r\nwhether  we  leave  the  Elections Department  in  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  Office or transfer it to the President's  Office,\r\n\r\nthe same question will be raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point on the Elections Department is whether we have\r\n\r\na fair Elections\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment  that  conducts  its business,  in  a  transparent\r\n\r\nmanner, and that the public can see  there is no fraud.  Even\r\n\r\nif  we  have  an Elections Commission, it will not  solve  Mr\r\n\r\nChia's  problem.  I know, and he has read in the papers  too,\r\n\r\nthat  many countries have Election Commissions and there  are\r\n\r\ncomplaints  about fraud, vote buying, pressure, rigging,  and\r\n\r\nall  kinds  of electoral excesses.  So having an  independent\r\n\r\nElections  Commission does not guarantee him a fair election.\r\n\r\nWhat is most important, and this has been established in  our\r\n\r\ncase for many years, is that the people running the Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment  are  civil  servants who  carry  out  their  work\r\n\r\nobjectively and they did it fairly and according to the  law.\r\n\r\nThat  has  been the practice all these years.  We have  civil\r\n\r\nservants  with high integrity and they have the systems,  and\r\n\r\nthey follow what is provided for in the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, regardless of whether we have an independent\r\n\r\nElections  Commission, an Elections Department in  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  Office  or in the President's  Office,  it  still\r\n\r\ndepends  on  the  people running the election.   If  we  have\r\n\r\npeople  whom  we  can  trust,  with  high  integrity,   fair,\r\n\r\nbalanced,  objective,  then  we  have  a  fair  and  balanced\r\n\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look back at all our elections, nobody has\r\n\r\nchallenged  the fact that our elections have been  fair.   If\r\n\r\nnot,  Mr  Chiam would not be here; Mr Low would not be  here,\r\n\r\nand the NCMP would not have a chance to even smell 35%.  So I\r\n\r\nthink  the  basis  for  saying that by having  the  Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment under the Prime Minister's Office leads to  unfair\r\n\r\npractices simply is not valid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On out-of-bounds markers, is there a list of OB markers?\r\n\r\nThis  is  not a golf course!  The political arena  is  not  a\r\n\r\nphysical  structure  that we can set markers.   Same  as  for\r\n\r\nnation building, as well as development of a society.   These\r\n\r\ncannot   be   marked  by  markers.   There  are  conventions,\r\n\r\npractices,  norms, values that we have established  over  the\r\n\r\nyears.  These values, norms, etc, change according to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe times.  As society matures and develops, as people become\r\n\r\nbetter   educated,  better  informed,  then   the   society's\r\n\r\nexpectations  of  what  should  and  can  be  done  will   be\r\n\r\ndifferent.  People have acknowledged that we have  changed  a\r\n\r\nlot  in  the  last 15-20 years.  The society has become  more\r\n\r\nopen,  much  more consultative, more participatory,  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has always encouraged people to take part  in  the\r\n\r\naffairs of the nation, because these are matters that concern\r\n\r\ntheir lives and future.\r\n\r\nTo  say that the Government has put obstacles and discouraged\r\n\r\npeople  just because there are unseen OB markers simply  does\r\n\r\nnot state the facts.  The facts are there for him to see.  He\r\n\r\ncan  read  the  newspapers.  There are many  letters  in  the\r\n\r\npress.   In  fact, the editors receive so many  letters,  and\r\n\r\nthey can choose only a few letters to publish every day.   He\r\n\r\ncan  watch  talk show programmes on television and listen  to\r\n\r\nthe   radio,  and  people  speak  up.   Even  in  Parliament,\r\n\r\nOpposition Members spoke up.  They are none the worse.   Even\r\n\r\nthose  Opposition  Members, who are outside Parliament,  they\r\n\r\nalso spoke up.  They are none the worse for that, unless they\r\n\r\ndeliberately  offend  the  law.   Whether  a  person  is   an\r\n\r\nOpposition, or whoever, if he breaks the law, the law will go\r\n\r\nafter  him.   There is no question about it.  So long  as  he\r\n\r\ndoes things within the confines of the law, nothing is taboo.\r\n\r\nHe  can carry on talking, he can carry on criticising, he can\r\n\r\nhave  his views.  But as he has noted, if he has very  strong\r\n\r\nviews  about Government policies, and if Government is  right\r\n\r\nthat  he is wrong headed, the Government will come down  very\r\n\r\nhard.   Is it because the Government deliberately does it  to\r\n\r\nstamp  out  comments?  No.  He must take  responsibility  for\r\n\r\nwhat  he  has  said, as Mr Chia himself admitted.   He  takes\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  his  comments and  the  Government  will\r\n\r\nrespond, and the public, who read and hear both sides,  would\r\n\r\ndecide  who is right.  If the Government does not  come  back\r\n\r\nand  rebut  and  comment, and if his  views  are  allowed  to\r\n\r\nprevail, then over time, people would say that the Government\r\n\r\nhas got no arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is not afraid of genuine debate. A\r\n\r\nperson  can talk, he can debate, he can bring out  views,  he\r\n\r\ncan  disagree.  But that does not mean that he must tear down\r\n\r\nthe institutions, the foundations, or our value system.  That\r\n\r\nwould  make  people  lose  respect  and  credibility  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Once people lose credibility, not  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  found  wanting, or not  doing  its  job,  but\r\n\r\nbecause the Government is doing its job and there are  people\r\n\r\nwho  want to cast doubt on that, the Government has  to  come\r\n\r\nback  and  respond  to it.  Otherwise, the Government  cannot\r\n\r\ngovern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in many societies, many things are being said and\r\n\r\nthe  leaders  just  leave things as they are.   It  is  their\r\n\r\nsystem.   In  our system, we must make sure that  our  people\r\n\r\nknow that this is a good Government.  They understand what is\r\n\r\na  good  Government and they have benefited  from  this  good\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Otherwise, we will not be credible, not just  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans but to all our foreign investors.  And  that  is\r\n\r\nimportant for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who say that they are afraid to speak up, I think\r\n\r\nit  is  only  a cop-out for not wanting to take part,  either\r\n\r\nbecause  they are pathetic, they do not want to be  involved,\r\n\r\nor it is just an excuse not to want to take part in anything.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot define OB markers by law. It is not possible.\r\n\r\nSociety  changes and evolves, and we have to evolve with  it.\r\n\r\nThere  are many channels that are open to the people to speak\r\n\r\nup.   This  is  known  to  everyone.  Are  the  young  people\r\n\r\ndiscouraged  from this?  I do not see that happening.   Those\r\n\r\nyoung  people who do not want to be involved, they  are  most\r\n\r\nlikely  the  ones  who find themselves too  busy  with  their\r\n\r\ncareers,  personal  pursuits,  or  with  their  relationship.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they find little time for community  or  national\r\n\r\nmatters.  But we encourage them to take part.  There are many\r\n\r\navenues for this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Singapore 21 exercise, more than 6,000 people\r\n\r\ntook part, and many of them were young Singaporeans.  In  the\r\n\r\nrecently\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nset  up  Remaking Singapore Committee, there are  many  young\r\n\r\npeople,  and I encourage them to come forward to  give  their\r\n\r\nviews.   And we must bear in mind that in this very sensitive\r\n\r\nregional  geopolitical context and the  fault  lines  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety  -  issues of race, language, religion and culture  - these  should be treaded very carefully before we break these\r\n\r\nfault lines and turn them into a disaster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has his usual lament about treating the\r\n\r\nOpposition  and recognising them.  The question  of  his  MPS\r\n\r\noffice  was dealt with way back 10 years ago, if I  remember,\r\n\r\nin 1991-1992, when HDB decided that, owing to the shortage of\r\n\r\nvoid  deck  space,  they would give the  space  only  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  organisations.  As for MPS office, he should  look\r\n\r\nafter  himself, find some way, rent a place, and he can  have\r\n\r\nhis MPS office.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Government treating the PAP MPs differently? No,\r\n\r\nthe  Government does not directly get involved in giving  the\r\n\r\nPAP  MPs  an  office.  It is the PAP Community Foundation,  a\r\n\r\ncharity  social service organisation, that set up these  void\r\n\r\ndeck  offices.  They run kindergartens and some of the  other\r\n\r\nsocial  services,  like childcare or day  care,  and  only  a\r\n\r\nlimited  period  is let out to the MP to hold meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsessions.  The MP does not use the place all the time.  It is\r\n\r\nonly once a week and rent is paid for that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can't Mr Chiam find similar arrangements? He can\r\n\r\nset  up a Foundation.  If not, he can always rent space  from\r\n\r\nany  owner of the shop, or whoever wants to let him  use  the\r\n\r\nspace  once  a  week.  I heard previously that Mr  Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nheld his MPS at a coffeeshop.  That is a private arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe  Government does not set out to help the PAP MPs, neither\r\n\r\ndoes it set out to help the Opposition MPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about the role of the advisor and why the\r\n\r\nlosing PAP candidate is treated better.  The PAP candidate is\r\n\r\nan  advisor of grassroots organisations.  I have explained on\r\n\r\nmany  occasions in this House the role of the advisors.  They\r\n\r\nare the ones who assist the Government,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough  the  People's Association, to carry  out  Government\r\n\r\npolicies.   I  think  it is quite farfetched  to  expect  the\r\n\r\nOpposition Members to help carry out Government policies  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   That is not doable.  I do not  think  Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nwill  agree to that.  Otherwise, he would become one  of  us.\r\n\r\nWhether  it  is Mr Eric Low or Mr Seetoh, they are  advisors,\r\n\r\nand  they  perform  community service as  advisors  in  these\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations.  It has nothing  to  do  with  the\r\n\r\nremaking  of  Singapore.   We  do  not  want  to  remake  the\r\n\r\nOpposition!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On NMP and NCMP honorarium, I find it quite ironical for\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam now to speak up for Mr Steve Chia and argue  for  a\r\n\r\nhigher honorarium.  First, let me make it clear that the  NMP\r\n\r\nand  NCMP  do  not  receive an allowance.   They  receive  an\r\n\r\nhonorarium,  which is a small sum of money in recognition  of\r\n\r\ntheir services and contribution in Parliament.  They are  not\r\n\r\nlike  elected  MPs  who have a bigger role  to  play  in  the\r\n\r\nconstituencies and in Parliament.  So let us not  equate  the\r\n\r\nNCMP  with  that of the elected MP, regardless  of  how  many\r\n\r\npercent of votes he has received.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years ago, when we debated the NCMP scheme, Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  called them the \"backdoor MPs\".  He called  them  non-constituency  because  they  do  not  represent  anybody  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  they are second-class MPs.  Now, just  because  Mr\r\n\r\nSteve  Chia is a member of the SDA and Mr Chiam is the leader\r\n\r\nof  the  SDA, he sees it in his self-interest to promote  his\r\n\r\nfellow colleague in this House.  That is, in fact, completely\r\n\r\nwithin his right, but we must draw a distinction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP, like the NMP, does not have the same rights,\r\n\r\nduties and responsibilities as the elected MPs.  First,  they\r\n\r\ncannot  vote  on  confidence motions against the  Government.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  they  cannot vote on money  Bills,  Supply  Bills,\r\n\r\nConstitutional amendments.  Thirdly, the NCMP and NMP do  not\r\n\r\nhave constituencies to look after.  We must remember that the\r\n\r\nduties  and  responsibilities of the NCMP and  NMP  are  very\r\n\r\ndifferent from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelected MPs.  It is this Government that made it possible  to\r\n\r\nhave  NCMP,  because the people wanted to  have  the  PAP  in\r\n\r\nParliament.   In  fact,  they  wanted  as  many  PAP  MPs  in\r\n\r\nParliament  as possible and we do not want a situation  where\r\n\r\nthe whole House is completely filled with elected PAP MPs and\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  Opposition  voice.  So  the  Constitution  was\r\n\r\namended to provide for Non-Constituency MP, so that the  best\r\n\r\nlosers  will come in if there is no Opposition MP.  The  fact\r\n\r\nthat we now have two Opposition MPs means we can now have one\r\n\r\nNCMP.   That is how Mr Chia got in here, and in the words  of\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam, which he said many years ago, \"by the grace of the\r\n\r\nPAP\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to belabour this point. But to say\r\n\r\nthat  he had 35% of the votes of Chua Chu Kang, and therefore\r\n\r\nshould  be entitled to 40% of the allowance is simply without\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> 50%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Still no basis. Because if we follow\r\n\r\nthat  argument  that Mr Chia had 35% of the votes,  then  our\r\n\r\nfirst-past-the-post system will not work.  We will then  have\r\n\r\na  different  system altogether.  If we have  a  proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation  system where if his  party  has  35%  of  the\r\n\r\nvotes,  then  he will have 35% of the seats.   But  for  good\r\n\r\nreasons,   which  I  have  explained  many  times   in   this\r\n\r\nParliament,    we   should   not   have   the    proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation   system.   We  have  the  first-past-the-post\r\n\r\nsystem.   Winner takes all.  He must get 50% plus  one  vote,\r\n\r\nand that is it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay, or any of our PAP MPs\r\n\r\nwho won against an Opposition, he does not just represent 65%\r\n\r\nof  the  electorate, he represents all the residents  in  the\r\n\r\nconstituency.   I cannot see Mr Low saying to his  residents,\r\n\r\n\"I  don't  represent you because you may have voted  for  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.\"  He does not know who voted for the  Opposition.\r\n\r\nBut  once he is elected under this system, he represents  all\r\n\r\nthe  residents in Chua Chu Kang.  He does not speak only  for\r\n\r\n65% of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia said, if I heard him correctly, that his job is\r\n\r\nnot confined to one constituency, but all constituencies, and\r\n\r\nhe  has to deal with a lot of constituency matters.  I  think\r\n\r\nit is a bit too much.  I do not think my colleagues here will\r\n\r\nagree  with him.  If he wants to do that, please  go  and  do\r\n\r\nthat  as  a  free agent.  He, as an NCMP, does not  represent\r\n\r\nanyone at all in the constituency, not even in Chua Chu Kang.\r\n\r\nHe  does not know who voted for him.  He knows he had 35%  of\r\n\r\nthe votes.  That is all.  But in the system that we have,  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not represent anyone in this Parliament.  Let  me  make\r\n\r\nthis very clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no question of revising the honorarium to\r\n\r\n40%, as Mr Chia has asked, or 50%, as Mr Chiam has asked.  It\r\n\r\nis  15%, quite appropriate, quite in keeping with the  amount\r\n\r\nof  work  and contribution that an NMP and NCMP make in  this\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same applies to the use of the allowance for\r\n\r\nLegislative and Secretarial Assistants.  The NCMP  and  NMP's\r\n\r\njob  in Parliament is to speak up in debates, etc.  There  is\r\n\r\nno  constituency duty.  There may be some research that needs\r\n\r\nto  be done in looking up the papers, or whatever, for making\r\n\r\nspeeches in Parliament.  For that, he can have access to  the\r\n\r\nParliament  Librarian.   I am sure our  Parliament  Librarian\r\n\r\nwill  be very happy to help him with any information that  he\r\n\r\nseeks.   But that is not the same as the $1,000 that we  give\r\n\r\nto the elected MPs to hire a Legislative Assistant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP's honorarium is only $1,600, or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nTo give him $1,000 to hire a Legislative Assistant is totally\r\n\r\nout  of  proportion  to the honorarium.   Definitely,  it  is\r\n\r\ncompletely unjustifiable.  I cannot explain that.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I have a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.

I am the\r\n\r\nAdviser  to the Singapore Interpreters and Translators  Union\r\n\r\nand, more than 25 years ago, I was a court interpreter for  3\r\n\r\n1/2 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our political leaders travel to foreign non-English\r\n\r\nspeaking   countries   and   have  discussions   with   their\r\n\r\ncounterparts,  they must have noticed the  high  standard  of\r\n\r\ntheir  interpreters.   The Chinese and Japanese  simultaneous\r\n\r\ninterpreters  are  normally  high-ranking  officers  in   the\r\n\r\nforeign  services.  Do we have the same kind of  interpreters\r\n\r\nin   Singapore?   If  we  take  the  standards  set  by   the\r\n\r\nInternational  Association of Conference  Interpreters  as  a\r\n\r\nreference,   the   answer  is  yes.   We   have   world-class\r\n\r\ninterpreters.   However, we have only  two.

Besides, they have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  called  upon  to  interpret  at  various  international\r\n\r\nconferences.  However, I raise this cut to remind PSD that as\r\n\r\nfar  as  world-class  interpreters  are  concerned,  we  have\r\n\r\nstopped  at  two  for too long a time and we  should  produce\r\n\r\nmore, if we can afford it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last three decades, the scheme of interpreters\r\n\r\nand  translators has not been reviewed while  other  services\r\n\r\nhave  been  revised on a number of occasions.  Market  forces\r\n\r\nhave forced many interpreters and translators to hop over  to\r\n\r\nother  jobs  with  better career prospects.  Young  graduates\r\n\r\nleave  after  a  short spell in the service, as  the  present\r\n\r\nscheme  offers not much career prospects and the remuneration\r\n\r\nis not commensurate with their capabilities and competencies,\r\n\r\nand  the  responsibilities they carry.  As  they  put  it  in\r\n\r\nChinese,  \"meiyou  qian tu, ye meiyou qian  tu\",  meaning  no\r\n\r\ncareer prospect, neither is there any money prospect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the gap between the pay of the interpreters in the\r\n\r\npublic  and  the private sectors is so wide, that  the  Chief\r\n\r\nInterpreter's  monthly salary is equivalent  to  only  4  1/2\r\n\r\ndays'  conference  interpreting fees in the  private  sector.\r\n\r\nThus, the feeling among them is that they are, \"zhong yong bu\r\n\r\nzhong shang\", ie, heavy responsibilities with stingy rewards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSD needs to revamp the scheme of the service and, more\r\n\r\nimportantly, something should be done to reward  and  attract\r\n\r\nthe  talent  at  the  top  rung,  ie,  the  interpreters  and\r\n\r\ntranslators in Parliament and Supreme Court.  Sir, we are  an\r\n\r\ninternational convention centre, with one million  foreigners\r\n\r\nworking  in  Singapore.   The  demand  for  foreign  language\r\n\r\ninterpreters  has  been  on  an  unprecedented   rise.    The\r\n\r\nengagement of casual foreign language interpreters by various\r\n\r\nauthorities has been in an unsatisfactory state.  No criteria\r\n\r\nhave  been set for their accreditation.

The sun sets and  will  rise\r\n\r\nagain  with  globalisation.  And, if  we  are  serious  about\r\n\r\nglobalisation and want to be a winner in the world market, we\r\n\r\nare  serious about what we are telling the world in their own\r\n\r\nlanguage, we need to professionalise the services.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in response to Mr\r\n\r\nSeng  Han  Thong's  question, there are  two  working  groups\r\n\r\nheaded  by MITA and the Subordinate Courts which are  working\r\n\r\non how we can improve the structure of the schemes to provide\r\n\r\nbetter  career development and progression opportunities  for\r\n\r\ntranslators and interpreters.  They are also exploring how we\r\n\r\ncan  enhance  the  learning  and training  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nofficers  in  order  to raise the professional  standards  of\r\n\r\ninterpretation and translation in the civil service.  The PSD\r\n\r\nhas  been  assisting in this review.  We will  wait  for  the\r\n\r\nworking groups' final recommendations which, I am sure,  will\r\n\r\nhelp  the  public service better attract, retain and motivate\r\n\r\nour interpreters and translators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion to have a system of accreditation for\r\n\r\ninterpreters used by Government bodies, I think we may  leave\r\n\r\nit to the courts, who are the major users of interpreters, to\r\n\r\nstudy this suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, I may add that I think it would be difficult\r\n\r\nfor  us to equal the standards of the interpreters which  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  and the Chinese have.  For them, it is  their  only\r\n\r\nway  to  connect with the rest of the world.

When  we  meet  them,  we\r\n\r\nrecognise  that we are dealing with not only a  very  capable\r\n\r\ninterpreter    but   somebody   who   has   a   comprehensive\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the issues and, indeed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmight  be  a very senior official himself.

The Government  has\r\n\r\nannounced that it intends to reduce the corporate tax rate in\r\n\r\nthe  top-end  personal income tax rate to 20% by  year  2004.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the GST is increased to 5%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since 1985, almost 20 years ago, we have reduced\r\n\r\nour direct corporate tax from a high of 40% to nearly half at\r\n\r\n20%  by  year 2004.  This is a very substantial drop, and  it\r\n\r\nhas  helped  Singapore  to maintain its  competitiveness.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  whether the Government has any further intention  to\r\n\r\nset a lower direct tax to, say, 16%, to be closer to the rate\r\n\r\nused in Hong Kong.  If there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  need  to  reduce direct tax, the main concern  is  whether\r\n\r\nthere  would  be  a  parallel increase in the  GST  rate,  to\r\n\r\naccount  for the loss of income due to a reduction of  direct\r\n\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we heard from Deputy Prime Minister Lee that\r\n\r\nhe  cannot  give an assurance that GST will not be raised  in\r\n\r\nthe  next five years.  Sir, this is a concern of many  people\r\n\r\non  this  remark of the Deputy Prime Minister.  We know  that\r\n\r\nmany  prudent policies and principles are being  reviewed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Review  Committee and  the  Committee  on  the\r\n\r\nRemaking of Singapore.  It is well and good that policies  be\r\n\r\nconstantly reviewed to bring them up to date and are  changed\r\n\r\nwith the times.  We want to ensure that they remain relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, overall, I want to say that we must have been\r\n\r\nstriking the right formula with regard to Singapore's  global\r\n\r\ntax regime.  $7-8 billion of foreign investments continue  to\r\n\r\nflow  into  Singapore  yearly.  We regularly  achieve  budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses,  as  shown  in the charts  by  Mr  Tan  Soo  Khoon\r\n\r\nyesterday,  also in billions of dollars every  year.   Local-based  corporations  and  people are  paying  relatively  low\r\n\r\ntaxes,  compared to many other countries.  So, if the formula\r\n\r\nis right, let us keep it.  Do not tinker too much with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people wish to know what is the Government's long-term plan with regard to the tax philosophy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  What the people want is some degree of certainty\r\n\r\nof how our tax burden would be like in the long term.  Hence,\r\n\r\nI would like to ask the Minister for Finance whether he could\r\n\r\nenlighten the House on this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the present trend seems to be towards making\r\n\r\nour present personal income tax system more complex, with the\r\n\r\nvarious  new reliefs and rebates being introduced.   Like  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh said yesterday, we appear to  have  become  a\r\n\r\nnation  of reliefs and rebates.  There are several  types  of\r\n\r\nreliefs,  such as for NSF, handicapped children,  baby  bonus\r\n\r\nand many others.  Then, there are also constant rebates being\r\n\r\ngiven.  Should we not make all these rebates simplified as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npart  of  the basic tax structure?  I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance whether this approach will continue with\r\n\r\nregard  to  reliefs and rebates in future,  or  is  there  an\r\n\r\nintention to simplify the overall tax structure?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for my second cut, I wish to talk on the tax system\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to  the impact of the one-tier tax  system  for\r\n\r\ndividends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the proposed one-tier system for dividend\r\n\r\npayments for shares, there is no allowance for tax credit for\r\n\r\nindividuals.   Under  the  new  system,  both  corporate  and\r\n\r\nindividual shareholders are treated equally, as they will  be\r\n\r\ntaxed  at  the  prevailing corporate  tax  rate.   Individual\r\n\r\nshareholders and institutions with tax-exempt status will  no\r\n\r\nlonger get tax credits based on the difference between  their\r\n\r\nmarginal  tax  rate  and the corporate  tax  rate.   From  my\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  the  new  regulation,  I  would  like   to\r\n\r\nhighlight to the Minister for Finance that this one-tier  tax\r\n\r\nsystem  works to the disadvantage of the following groups  of\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, individuals, especially the lower income\r\n\r\nworkers and retirees who own shares, will now have to pay the\r\n\r\ntop-end   corporate  rate  on  their  earnings   from   share\r\n\r\ndividends.   For  these people, their personal  marginal  tax\r\n\r\nrate  could  well  be zero or very low.  Therefore,  the  new\r\n\r\nscheme is disadvantageous to them as they now have to pay the\r\n\r\nfull  corporate tax rates for the dividend on the shares they\r\n\r\nown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, institutions that used to enjoy tax-free\r\n\r\nstatus, such as charities and community groups, will now have\r\n\r\nto  bear the full corporate tax for the dividends earned from\r\n\r\ntheir shareholdings of companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, real estate investment trusts (REITs) also\r\n\r\nsuffer  a disadvantage as the shareholders of REITs will  pay\r\n\r\nthe  top-end  corporate tax rate, whereas one of the  salient\r\n\r\npoints  of REITs is the possibility that taxes will  only  be\r\n\r\npaid at the end of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  shareholders, and be taxed at their respective  marginal\r\n\r\nincome tax rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe this is not the intention of the new\r\n\r\nsystem  that  has  a negative impact on the above  groups  of\r\n\r\npersons who are essentially low-income earners and charitable\r\n\r\norganisations.  May I suggest to the Minister for Finance  to\r\n\r\nconsider allowing dividends to be imputed as normal income of\r\n\r\nsuch shareholders.  Thereafter, they could be assessed to pay\r\n\r\ntheir  respective taxes according to their personal  marginal\r\n\r\nincome tax rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to suggest a few\r\n\r\ninitiatives  related  to  tax  that,  I  believe,  will  make\r\n\r\nSingapore even more attractive to investors and individuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, on the group consolidation proposal that the\r\n\r\nMinister  made, could I ask the Minister to revise the  limit\r\n\r\nfrom 75% to 51%?  It seems that this is targeted to a limited\r\n\r\ngroup of companies, especially property companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on property taxes, can I suggest that we\r\n\r\ndevise  a  new concept of a variable property tax system  for\r\n\r\nbusinesses where the Government charges a low fixed rate of 1-2%,  and a variable rate based on percentage of profits  that\r\n\r\nthe companies make, subject to a maximum cap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third idea is one of a reverse pioneer tax status\r\n\r\nfor  companies  that internationalise and have  positive  tax\r\n\r\nimpact  by  way  of  incentives they get  when  investing  in\r\n\r\nforeign  countries.  We should allow such companies to  bring\r\n\r\ntheir  income  back into Singapore without taxing  them,  and\r\n\r\nallow  the  parent companies in Singapore to tax  deduct  the\r\n\r\ncapital investment they make in their overseas subsidiaries.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, preferential tax treatment should be given to\r\n\r\ncompanies   which   invest  in  improving   productivity   of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  companies, so that they  continue  to  have  a\r\n\r\nviable presence  here in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This is similar to certain incentives that we are\r\n\r\ngiving  to  companies  embarking on  specific  projects  like\r\n\r\nenvironmental and water conservation projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, the concept of negative gearing for taxes\r\n\r\nimposed  on  individuals on income derived  from  rentals  of\r\n\r\nproperties.   They  should  be able  to  write  off  expenses\r\n\r\nrelated to the maintenance of their rented properties against\r\n\r\ntheir  income  taxes  and thus operate like  businesses.   In\r\n\r\ndoing  so,  we  can develop a sense of enterprise  among  our\r\n\r\npeople.  We can follow examples that exist in a few countries\r\n\r\nand Australia is one of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, stock options for employees should be taxed upon\r\n\r\nrealisation  of  profits and not when exercised.   While  the\r\n\r\nMinister has allowed taxation to be delayed to the time  that\r\n\r\nthe  moratorium  ends, this seems to  be  just  half  a  step\r\n\r\nforward.   In many cases, at the end of the period, employees\r\n\r\ndo not necessarily sell their shares.  The suggestion that  I\r\n\r\nam making will encourage employees to hold on to their shares\r\n\r\nlonger, thus helping companies build employee loyalty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on the GST system. While I support the\r\n\r\nsystem, can the Government improve the efficiency of the  tax\r\n\r\nrebates  that exporters are claiming.  Currently,  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nthis is tied up and this affects the cashflow of companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I have already raised my\r\n\r\npoint  yesterday at the debate on the Budget Statement but  I\r\n\r\nhave yet to hear the Minister's reply on my suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, on this cut on corporate tax, I\r\n\r\nwish  to speak on group relief for corporate tax.  I am  very\r\n\r\npleased that the Government has finally agreed to allow group\r\n\r\nrelief for corporate tax.  This was a constant request of MPs\r\n\r\nin  the past few years, but it has not been agreed to by  the\r\n\r\nformer Finance Minister, Dr Richard Hu.  We are pleased  that\r\n\r\nthe  new Finance Minister, DPM Lee Hsien Loong has agreed  to\r\n\r\nthis  proposal.  I would like to say that this is one of  the\r\n\r\nsacred cows that we are pleased to see being removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present scheme allows us for group relief for\r\n\r\ncorporate tax for Singapore companies, with 75% ownership  of\r\n\r\nSingapore-based  subsidiaries.   I  would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that in future, the scheme can be extended  to  the\r\n\r\nfollowing two areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, like Mr Inderjit Singh has said, to allow group\r\n\r\nrelief  for  subsidiaries that are above 51% ownership.   The\r\n\r\nreason  is that the standard definition of subsidiary is  for\r\n\r\ncompanies that are more than 51% owned.  If the concern is of\r\n\r\nexcessive tax losses due to the lowering of the definition of\r\n\r\nthe  subsidiary to 51%,  then, I would like to  suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe amount of tax relief can be accrued and computed based on\r\n\r\nthe actual percentage ownership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to allow group relief for foreign-owned\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries of Singapore-owned companies. The main reason is\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore companies often have to go overseas  to  look\r\n\r\nfor  investment as Singapore itself is a very  small  market.\r\n\r\nAs  overseas investments are of high-risk and high reward  in\r\n\r\nnature,  there  is  more need for group relief  for  overseas\r\n\r\ninvestments to mitigate the prospects of losses.   If  it  is\r\n\r\nthe concern of Government that it may serve to be too much of\r\n\r\na  tax  leakage,  then the Government can  consider  allowing\r\n\r\ngroup  relief for foreign subsidiaries only a limited  number\r\n\r\nof  period,  say, only for the initial five  years  from  the\r\n\r\nperiod of formation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Finance Minister would consider these\r\n\r\nproposals favourably.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have asked the question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I understand that\r\n\r\nunder  the  current  income tax system, an annuity  purchased\r\n\r\nwith  cash is subject to a tax of 3% of the capital sum until\r\n\r\nsuch  time  that the amount deemed to be a refund on  capital\r\n\r\nhas  been exhausted.  Then all payments received subsequently\r\n\r\nare taxable in full, while annuities purchased with CPF funds\r\n\r\nare tax-exempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder why annuities bought in cash should be subject\r\n\r\nto  tax.   First  of all, is the Government  not  encouraging\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to save for old age?  I think  taxing  of  such\r\n\r\nsavings meant for old age is contrary to the objective of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  provide  a  saving  framework  for  old   age\r\n\r\nfinancial security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, since we do not have capital gains tax\r\n\r\nand  the  Government has decided not to tax interest earnings\r\n\r\nin  savings  in the recent Budget, is there justification  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to tax on annuities bought in cash?  I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister for Finance to consider exempting tax  for\r\n\r\nannuities bought in cash.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Kian Min is not here.

We think\r\n\r\nthis is adequate and there is no need to go below 20% in  the\r\n\r\nnear  future, because with our various tax incentive schemes,\r\n\r\ncompanies  qualifying for these schemes often have  effective\r\n\r\ntax  rates  lower  than Hong Kong's.   But  we  cannot  tell,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  how  the situation develops.   It  may  become\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  us  to  go below 20%,  and  if  we  have  the\r\n\r\nwherewithal  to  do so, we can do.  If we  do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nwherewithal  to  do  so,  and  it  is  a  totally   different\r\n\r\nenvironment,  then  we  will  have  to  re-look  at  all  our\r\n\r\ncalculations again.  But on our present plans, this is  where\r\n\r\nwe stand.  We work on this basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On reliefs, Mr Leong asked whether we have become a\r\n\r\nnation of reliefs and rebates.  I hope not.  Our approach  is\r\n\r\nto  grant  reliefs in recognition for individual efforts  and\r\n\r\nfor achieving certain social objectives. We grant new reliefs\r\n\r\nonly  after  very careful consideration.  We do  not  have  a\r\n\r\npolicy of creating new reliefs in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevery  new  Budget.  In fact, this year, we have incorporated\r\n\r\nthe  personal relief into the tax structure and made a  minor\r\n\r\nsimplification to our scheme.  We agree that our  tax  system\r\n\r\nshould be as simple as possible, and this is actually one  of\r\n\r\nour competitive advantages in Government administration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked about the one-tier tax system and\r\n\r\nnoted  that  this  disadvantaged low-income  groups  and  the\r\n\r\ncharities. Under the one-tier tax system, retirees and  other\r\n\r\nshareholders,  who pay low marginal income  tax  rates,  will\r\n\r\nlose  their ability to reclaim their tax paid by the  company\r\n\r\non the dividends.  But the loss will be compensated, at least\r\n\r\nto  some extent, because the new one-tier system will  remove\r\n\r\ncurrent  restrictions on the distribution of  dividends  from\r\n\r\ncapital gains and other non-taxable corporate income.  So the\r\n\r\nbase  on  which  the  companies can  pay  dividends  will  be\r\n\r\nbroader.    It  would  free  companies  from  a   number   of\r\n\r\nrestrictions  related  to distributing corporate  profits  as\r\n\r\ndividends  and  would also enable unlimited  flow-through  of\r\n\r\ndividends, meaning the subsidiaries can flow the dividend  up\r\n\r\nto  the  parent and then beyond that, to the parent's  parent\r\n\r\nand so on, without having to be taxed, which presently cannot\r\n\r\nbe done, because it can only flow through one level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These features of the one-tier tax system, along with\r\n\r\nnew  measures in group relief and lower corporate  tax  rate,\r\n\r\nwill  increase  company  income available  for  distribution.\r\n\r\nThis  could  result  in  higher  dividend  payments  for  all\r\n\r\nshareholders   and  this  would  benefit  all   shareholders,\r\n\r\nincluding individuals who either do not pay income tax or are\r\n\r\nat the lower-income tax brackets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have introduced a five-year transition period from\r\n\r\n1st   January  2003  to  31st  December  2007,  during  which\r\n\r\nshareholders  will  still be able to receive  dividends  with\r\n\r\ncredit  attached.  This would give companies time to  consume\r\n\r\ntheir accumulated credits and shareholders time to adjust  to\r\n\r\nthe  new  system.   The main reason for  this  change  is  to\r\n\r\nsimplify the corporate tax system and to facilitate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinancial  transactions,  like  share  buy-backs   or   share\r\n\r\nborrowing  and lending.  There is a trade-off, but  when  the\r\n\r\ncorporate income tax rate used to be 40%, it was important to\r\n\r\nhave  a  full imputation system because the impact was large.\r\n\r\nBut now that the corporate income tax rate is coming down  to\r\n\r\n20%, the full imputation is desirable, but less critical.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the impact of a tax treatment on Real Estate\r\n\r\nInvestment Trust (REIT), the Government is studying the issue\r\n\r\nand we will release further details at a later date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for group offsetting of corporate tax, which Mr Leong\r\n\r\nand Mr Inderjit Singh also raised, we have already decided to\r\n\r\nintroduce a system of group offsetting at 75%.  This is quite\r\n\r\na  low rate.  In fact, if we compare with other countries, we\r\n\r\nare  one of the lowest in the world.  Most countries  have  a\r\n\r\nthreshold closer to 100%.  In fact, Australia's threshold  is\r\n\r\n100%,  while the US' threshold is 80%.  Let us get experience\r\n\r\noperating  this  first  at  75%,  and  later  on,  if  it  is\r\n\r\nsuccessful, we can reconsider widening, lowering to 51%, pro-rating  and so on. These are complicated measures.   Even  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  group  offsets into our corporate  tax  system  is\r\n\r\nalready  a  major  departure.  We  will  have  to  craft  the\r\n\r\nlegislation and gain experience operating it before  we  take\r\n\r\nit further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for foreign subsidiaries, that is a separate problem\r\n\r\nbecause right now, foreign income is not taxed unless  it  is\r\n\r\nremitted  to  Singapore.  If you can  offset  foreign  losses\r\n\r\nagainst  local  profits, but you do not  tax  foreign  income\r\n\r\nbecause foreign profit may not be remitted to Singapore, then\r\n\r\nwe  are  actually subsidising foreign ventures from  domestic\r\n\r\ntax  revenue  and  this  revenue loss could  be  significant.\r\n\r\nThere  are people who have suggested ways to get around this,\r\n\r\nshort  of having a full global taxation system.  It is not  a\r\n\r\nsimple  matter.  Let us take it one step at a time.   The  UK\r\n\r\nhas got this scheme for loss transfer from foreign companies.\r\n\r\nI  think they did not volunteer to do this. They had to do it\r\n\r\nbecause  the  European Court of Justice ruled  in  1998  that\r\n\r\ntheir regional law was in conflict with EU community law,  so\r\n\r\nthey have no choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  have  no  EU community law to be consistent with,  so  we\r\n\r\nbetter study this carefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also asked for variable property tax\r\n\r\non  businesses, low fixed rate plus a variable rate based  on\r\n\r\npercentage  of  profits, subject to a cap.   But  this  would\r\n\r\nchange  the  principle of the property  tax.   In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nproperty tax is a wealth tax on asset ownership.  I  am  told\r\n\r\nthis  is based on the annual value of the property, which  is\r\n\r\nthe   estimated  annual  rental  the  property   can   fetch,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  whether it is in fact let out, owner-occupied\r\n\r\nor  vacant.   If  we  switch to what Mr  Inderjit  Singh  has\r\n\r\nsuggested, we would be changing that wealth tax to an  income\r\n\r\ntax,  and  instead of taxing the property, we will be  taxing\r\n\r\nthe  income  of  a company, and the more income  the  company\r\n\r\nearns, the more it will be paying in tax.  We already have  a\r\n\r\ncorporate  income  tax for that.  We are  bringing  the  rate\r\n\r\ndown,  I  think we leave that alone and keep the  wealth  tax\r\n\r\nelement  in the property tax as a separate component  of  our\r\n\r\noverall tax structure. They complement one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also recommended a reverse pioneer tax\r\n\r\nstatus   for  companies  that  internationalise  and   invest\r\n\r\noverseas.  In fact, we already have a scheme to bring  income\r\n\r\nback  to  Singapore without tax under section  13(8)  of  the\r\n\r\nIncome Tax Act.  But the condition is that the income must be\r\n\r\nreinvested   and  must  contribute  to  productive   economic\r\n\r\nactivity  here.  To have a general scheme for a complete  tax\r\n\r\nexemption  of  foreign income remittances, it is  too  big  a\r\n\r\nloophole.   It will risk severe revenue loss and  it  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  easy  to plug this loophole  administratively.\r\n\r\nEverybody says, \"If you allow this, then the funds will  flow\r\n\r\nback\".   What you will not see is that there will be tenants.\r\n\r\nThere  will  be  many  ways  that funds  will  flow  offshore\r\n\r\ninvisibly and you will not be able to stop it.  Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of a reverse pioneer, meaning do not tax  overseas\r\n\r\nprofits during a pioneer period, is an interesting idea.   It\r\n\r\namounts to not taxing companies for sending back their  small\r\n\r\nprofits  in  the  initial years, but  taxing  them  when  the\r\n\r\nprofits  grow  in the later years.  But this idea  cannot  be\r\n\r\naddressed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  its  own.   It has to be considered together  with  other\r\n\r\nproposals  like extending group relief, which Mr  Leong  Horn\r\n\r\nKee  suggested.  Let us not get too complicated at this point\r\n\r\n-  get Singapore companies to go overseas and make good money\r\n\r\nfirst.   If  they make money, then we can talk about  how  to\r\n\r\narrange  the taxation.  If there is no money made, we  cannot\r\n\r\nget started.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for preferential tax for companies improving\r\n\r\nproductivity  so  that  we  can continue  to  have  a  viable\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector, we already have a wide  range  of  tax\r\n\r\nincentives for doing this.  Many of these tax incentives  aim\r\n\r\nto improve productivity, encourage value-added activities and\r\n\r\ntechnology  innovation.   For  example,  we  have  a  reduced\r\n\r\ncorporate  tax rate of 10%, and now it would be  5%.  If  the\r\n\r\ncompany is awarded the development and expansion incentive we\r\n\r\ntake  into  consideration  the  value-added  contribution  to\r\n\r\nproductivity  in  the company when we assess  whether  it  is\r\n\r\neligible for the incentive.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for negative gearing on property, which means that if\r\n\r\nan  individual  owns a property and he has  expenses  on  the\r\n\r\nproperty  and  interest to be paid, and it  exceeds  what  he\r\n\r\nearns on that property, then we allow him to offset all those\r\n\r\nexpenses, not just on what he earned in rentals, but  on  his\r\n\r\nother  incomes, in other words, operate like a business which\r\n\r\nowns  a  property  -  the question is whether the  person  is\r\n\r\ncarrying  on  a trade in properties, in which case,  we  will\r\n\r\nallow  the offset, but when he sells the property,  the  gain\r\n\r\nwill  be  subject  to  tax.  Or, if he  is  just  owning  the\r\n\r\nproperty as an investment, in which case he is not subject to\r\n\r\ncapital  gains  tax, but neither can he offset  the  expenses\r\n\r\nbeyond the earnings from that property from rentals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not allow interest expense deductions on other\r\n\r\ntransactions.   For  example,  if  you  buy  a  car  on  hire\r\n\r\npurchase,  there  is interest to be paid,  that  is  not  tax\r\n\r\ndeductible.  The fact that we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallow  deduction of mortgage interest against property rental\r\n\r\nis  already in a sense a concession and if we go further  and\r\n\r\nallow interest expense to be deductible against other income,\r\n\r\napart from the rental income, I think it will encourage  even\r\n\r\nmore  over-investment in property.  In order that the  losses\r\n\r\ncan  be  offset against other income, I think we  should  not\r\n\r\nintroduce  any further distortions which incline people  even\r\n\r\nmore towards property purchase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, if I may point out, many property owners\r\n\r\nare  paying their mortgage interest using their CPF  savings.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, paying their mortgage loans using their CPF savings\r\n\r\nand the CPF monies are not taxable.  So if you are allowed to\r\n\r\npay  the  mortgage tax-free money and yet you  can  make  the\r\n\r\nmortgage   interest  tax-deductible,  then  you  are   giving\r\n\r\nindividuals  tax  benefits  twice,  which  is  not  a   sound\r\n\r\nprinciple to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also asked for stock options to be\r\n\r\ntaxed upon realisation of profits and not upon exercise,  ie,\r\n\r\nwhen the employee realises the benefits of share ownership at\r\n\r\nthe  point of exercise of the stock option.  So therefore the\r\n\r\ntax  liability arises at the point of exercise based  on  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  which  is  realised, in other  words,  the  discount\r\n\r\nbetween  the  market  price  and the  exercise  price.   Most\r\n\r\njurisdictions, for example, in Britain, Hong Kong,  and  also\r\n\r\nin  the US, for the normal stock option treatment, tax income\r\n\r\ngained  at exercise.  In other words, once you have exercised\r\n\r\nand  you buy the shares, whether you sell it or not, you have\r\n\r\nalready  derived the benefits, because you bought the  shares\r\n\r\nat a discount to what they were worth on the market.  We will\r\n\r\ntax  you  at  that point.  And, if you incur a tax liability,\r\n\r\nyou  better sell a portion of these shares to meet  that  tax\r\n\r\nliability,  unless you deliberately want to go  long  in  the\r\n\r\nshares,  but  then  you take a risk.   In  fact,  during  the\r\n\r\ndot.com boom some people incurred tax liabilities and did not\r\n\r\nsell  shares,  and  by the time they sold their  shares,  the\r\n\r\nprice had crashed and they had a big tax outstanding and some\r\n\r\nof  them were bankrupted.  But the system is fair.  They made\r\n\r\nthe wrong judgement call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case where the employee has to observe a\r\n\r\nmoratorium before he may dispose of the shares, now  we  will\r\n\r\nallow  him  to pay the tax only at the end of the  moratorium\r\n\r\nperiod,  which means the employee has to pay the tax only  at\r\n\r\nthe  point when he is actually able to dispose the shares and\r\n\r\nrealise  its  value.  And this is in fact a  special  benefit\r\n\r\nwhich  we  are  uniquely operating in Singapore.   Other  tax\r\n\r\njurisdictions do not have this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may answer Mr Steve Chia's question. He raised it\r\n\r\nyesterday  and we did not get around to it, but his  proposal\r\n\r\nis to exclude essential items from GST.  He disagrees that we\r\n\r\nshould  tax  essential  items and he also  wants  to  exclude\r\n\r\nservices provided by the Government from GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have two main reasons for taxing even essential items\r\n\r\nin  the  GST,  which  I  have explained on  other  occasions.\r\n\r\nFirst,  most essential items are not consumed by poor people.\r\n\r\nYou  can say it is rice, you can say it is education services\r\n\r\nor  health  services, but in fact, the largest  consumers  of\r\n\r\nthese  essential items are not poor people but higher  income\r\n\r\npeople.   For example, on average, if you compare a household\r\n\r\nwith  a monthly income of $10,000 against a household with  a\r\n\r\nmonthly  income  of  $1,000, on food,  the  $10,000-household\r\n\r\nspends 3 times more than the $1,000-household.  On education,\r\n\r\nthe  higher income household spends 7.5 times more, on health\r\n\r\ncare, the higher income household spends 3.7 times more.   So\r\n\r\nif we are going to exempt essentials from GST, it is going to\r\n\r\nbe a very large tax loss for very little benefit to the lower\r\n\r\nincome  groups.  Most of the money you are giving  away  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  to the lower income groups.  And so to make up  this\r\n\r\nrevenue,  you will have to raise the overall GST rate,  which\r\n\r\nis going to hurt the lower income groups.  So it is better to\r\n\r\nhave an overall coverage, cover everything, keep the rate  as\r\n\r\nlow  as  possible, whether it is 3% or 5% and then we  target\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income group through specific assistance,  offset\r\n\r\nsubsidies, whatever, in order to address their special needs,\r\n\r\nat  much  lower cost and much greater effect.   That  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that you have to make a distinction\r\n\r\nbetween  what  is an essential and what is not an  essential.\r\n\r\nYes, I can define arbitrarily sushi to be not essential,  and\r\n\r\nrice  and fish to be essentials.  But at the boundaries there\r\n\r\nwill  be  many  anomalies, many ridiculous things  which  you\r\n\r\ncannot   explain.   Mr  Tharman's  example  is  what   is   a\r\n\r\nconfectionery and what is a cake.  Well, it depends  on  what\r\n\r\nicing  and cream you put on top of it.  We are just  creating\r\n\r\ndistinctions which are meaningless but will occupy a  lot  of\r\n\r\nlegal time, arguing, defining, refining, disputing, which  is\r\n\r\nnot  worth  our while doing, and why do I want  to  encourage\r\n\r\npeople  to buy rice and fish separately instead of the  sushi\r\n\r\nready-made in Fairprice?  It does not make sense.  So, better\r\n\r\nto cover everything and again the focused subsidy will enable\r\n\r\nhim to buy whatever he wants, whatever he needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for services provided by the Government, which was\r\n\r\nanother  point  which  Mr  Chia raised  yesterday,  generally\r\n\r\nspeaking, there are services which recover their own cost and\r\n\r\nare  not funded out of taxpayers' money.  For example,  in  a\r\n\r\nrestructured hospital, if you stay in an \"A\" class  ward,  it\r\n\r\nmay be a Government operation, but there is no reason why  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  favour an \"A\" class ward in a restructured hospital\r\n\r\nagainst a private ward in Gleneagles or Mount Elizabeth.  So,\r\n\r\nin those circumstances, there is no reason to discriminate in\r\n\r\nfavour of the Government, just because the Government happens\r\n\r\nto be providing the service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offset package is generous. You know all lower\r\n\r\nincome  groups are looked after and have at least five years'\r\n\r\nworth  of  offsets.   We  have been through  these  arguments\r\n\r\nextensively.  I think the best way to run a GST system is  to\r\n\r\nkeep it clean, low-cost, easy compliance, efficient, and most\r\n\r\nconvenient and most bearable for many Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> What about senior citizens?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> As I have explained, the GST covers\r\n\r\neverybody, and the senior citizens, if they are in the lower\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincome  group,  they  will be covered by  our  schemes  which\r\n\r\nassist lower income groups.  And in the case of retirees  and\r\n\r\npensioners, we are also revising the Singapore Allowance  for\r\n\r\nthem,  and  that will also help them to offset any additional\r\n\r\nGST which they will have to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long term, to put it in perspective, it is\r\n\r\nprecisely  because  there is going to be a  large  number  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who are going to be senior citizens, and a small\r\n\r\nnumber  of Singaporeans are going to be working, that is  the\r\n\r\nreason why we cannot say we are only going to tax income, and\r\n\r\nonly  working people will pay tax.  Because in the long term,\r\n\r\nif  you  only tax income, the burden on the taxpayer  who  is\r\n\r\nworking  to pay for his services, as well as all the services\r\n\r\nfor  the  retired people, will be very great.  Now  with  ten\r\n\r\npeople  working to one retiree it is bearable.  In  the  long\r\n\r\nterm,  three to one.  Then will you be able to sustain  that?\r\n\r\nIt  is  not possible.  It is necessary to widen the tax  net,\r\n\r\nwhich  is why we have to cover senior citizens.  If they  are\r\n\r\nnot  poor, there is no reason to subsidise them.  If they are\r\n\r\npoor, there are ways we can help them out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about annuities and why they\r\n\r\nare taxable.  It took me a bit of puzzling out, to figure out\r\n\r\nthey are taxable, but there is a reason.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Mr Low Thia Khiang is wrong to say that\r\n\r\ninterest earnings are not taxed.  I made no such announcement\r\n\r\nin  the  Budget,  as far as I can remember.  So  interest  is\r\n\r\nstill taxable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the rationale for this is that we are allowing\r\n\r\nthe  capital  part portion of the annuity to be tax-free  but\r\n\r\nthe interest earnings' portion of the annuity will have to be\r\n\r\ntaxed.   So  what we are doing is, we are assuming that  when\r\n\r\nyou draw on your annuity, 3% of what you draw is interest and\r\n\r\nthe  balance is capital.  So the interest is taxable, because\r\n\r\ninterest  is  taxable  in  Singapore.   The  capital  is  not\r\n\r\ntaxable.  Until you have finished drawing out as capital, the\r\n\r\nentire  amount which you put into the annuity over the years,\r\n\r\nand then beyond\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we say, \"Well, all the rest we will treat as interest\".\r\n\r\nSo  beyond that point, the entire annuity sum will be taxable\r\n\r\nevery  month.  It is to be consistent with our approach  that\r\n\r\ncapital  sums are not taxable, but the interest is.   If  you\r\n\r\nsay  that  an annuity may have some capital gains element  in\r\n\r\nit, so it is not purely interest, that is something which  we\r\n\r\nwill have to consider.  It is something which we will have to\r\n\r\nstudy.

With  that  speech  as  a\r\n\r\nbackdrop, I have a few suggestions for the Minister  relating\r\n\r\nto  how  the  Government and its agencies  should  reposition\r\n\r\nthemselves.   And  some  of these suggestions  may  give  the\r\n\r\nMinister  an  idea  on how we can get close  to  achieving  a\r\n\r\ncouple  of the seven wish list items that I mentioned  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Government regulators and statutory boards\r\n\r\nshould absolutely stay away from business.  They should  have\r\n\r\nvery specific roles as regulators and should have very little\r\n\r\nrole  in influencing and facilitating the creation and growth\r\n\r\nof  businesses.  Currently, our regulators have  too  wide  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility, and they have a significant influence on  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of enterprises.  Any existing companies currently\r\n\r\nowned by statutory boards should be immediately spun off, and\r\n\r\nthey should not be allowed to form new companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I talked about Government being lean, and it\r\n\r\nshould  endeavour  to  remain lean  over  a  period  of  time\r\n\r\nthrough,  first, by productivity improvements and,  secondly,\r\n\r\nby oursourcing non-core activities as much as possible.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am not suggesting that we retrench civil servants, but  to\r\n\r\nreorganise  and  outsource activities where the  same  people\r\n\r\ncould  be  doing  the  same thing in a  private  organisation\r\n\r\nformed to perform the tasks which were previously done by the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One question I have for the Minister is the Government\r\n\r\nexpenditure of 5.6% of GDP.  How does this compare with other\r\n\r\ncountries?  And as the GDP grows, this percentage, I believe,\r\n\r\nshould come down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on the issue of Government procurement\r\n\r\nprocedures, I talked about giving opportunities to small  and\r\n\r\nmedium enterprises.  When I suggested that, I really did  not\r\n\r\nmean that they should be given the tenders, even if they  bid\r\n\r\nhigher  prices than the lowest tender.  There are many  other\r\n\r\nprocedures,  rules and regulations that govern the  tendering\r\n\r\nprocess,  including track records.  I am suggesting that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment look at the rest of the things and still  maintain\r\n\r\nthe  principle  of  lowest tenderer when awarding  contracts.\r\n\r\nAnd  in doing so, at least, SMEs and newer companies have  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to participate in the process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Government can also play a developmental role\r\n\r\nby  allowing companies to test bed their products.  The  fact\r\n\r\nthat Nokia transformed from a shoe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfactory  to the world's number one telecommunications  player\r\n\r\nwas  because  in  the  early days, the  defence  ministry  in\r\n\r\nFinland  allowed  Nokia  to test out their  technologies  and\r\n\r\nproducts.   In the USA, big companies and the government  too\r\n\r\nplay  a developmental role by helping start-ups, particularly\r\n\r\nin  the technology area.  The Government should therefore  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  allow a little higher cost and  a  little  less\r\n\r\nefficiency as a result of allowing test bedding.  In the last\r\n\r\n3-4  years,  this phenomenon has also resulted  in  excellent\r\n\r\nresults in South Korea, where many world-class standards  are\r\n\r\nevolving  in the wireless technology area, again as a  result\r\n\r\nof  test  bedding and allowing many entrepreneurs to try  out\r\n\r\ntheir products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Enterprise Challenge, which is a\r\n\r\nscheme administered by the civil service, be greatly expanded\r\n\r\nto encourage test bedding, and civil servants should be given\r\n\r\nmerit  points for facilitating this in Government.  Actually,\r\n\r\ntest bedding is already happening, and I am suggesting it  be\r\n\r\nexpanded so that everyone knows about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next cut I have is on financing and risk\r\n\r\ncapital  for  Singapore-based  companies.   There  are  three\r\n\r\nelements  that  are  needed  to transform  Singapore  from  a\r\n\r\ncorporate-based economy to an entrepreneurial-based  economy.\r\n\r\nFirst,  we need the entrepreneurs or talent; second, we  need\r\n\r\nthe  regulatory  environment  and  infrastructure  which   is\r\n\r\nconducive;  and,  third,  we need a well-developed  financing\r\n\r\nenvironment.   Currently,  we have weaknesses  in  all  three\r\n\r\nareas.   For the purpose of this cut, I would like to suggest\r\n\r\na  number of possible schemes which may help plug the gap  in\r\n\r\nthe financing environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that Temasek should\r\n\r\nproactively   provide  risk  capital   financing   to   local\r\n\r\nenterprises,   in  addition  to  financing  Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Temasek  should also consider  partnering  local\r\n\r\ncompanies to make overseas investments in technology  and  in\r\n\r\nnew  competencies  which may not exist in Singapore.   So  we\r\n\r\nshould be willing to move out of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larger companies, especially GLCs, should be allowed to\r\n\r\ntax  deduct when they use part of their profits to invest  in\r\n\r\nstart-ups.   This  will greatly increase the availability  of\r\n\r\nrisk  capital.  Obviously, each company, including  the  GLC,\r\n\r\nshould  ensure  that their shareholders'  interests  are  not\r\n\r\ncompromised when they do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should incentivise and compel banks to move\r\n\r\nfrom the current collateral-based financing towards cash flow\r\n\r\nand  IP-based financing, by giving banks a 5-year tax  waiver\r\n\r\nor  double tax deduction when they lend money based  on  this\r\n\r\nnew  method.  These waivers of tax deduction should  only  be\r\n\r\napplicable  when there is no personal guarantee  required  by\r\n\r\nbanks,  to  encourage  the  banks to  move  away  from  their\r\n\r\nconservative approach currently practised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like to urge the Minister to accelerate the\r\n\r\nfull  liberalisation  of the banking  sector,  so  that  more\r\n\r\nforeign  banks  can  have full privileges compared  to  local\r\n\r\nbanks.    This  will  open up many more  channels  for  local\r\n\r\ncompanies and individuals to raise funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, can we try to attract the likes of\r\n\r\nSilicon  Valley Bank and Softbank into Singapore?  We  should\r\n\r\nalso liberalise our financial sector to allow our local banks\r\n\r\nto  specialise in cash flow financing, as I said earlier, and\r\n\r\nthey should set up their bases in Singapore, and some of them\r\n\r\ndo this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home-grown companies, when globalising, should get the\r\n\r\nsupport  from  their  home bases.  If  their  own  home  base\r\n\r\nfinancial institutions are not helping, they have very little\r\n\r\nhope of help from banks overseas.  We should look at the Hong\r\n\r\nKong's  model of the SMELoan, which is a small  bank  and  it\r\n\r\ndoes not take deposits but depends on equity investments.  It\r\n\r\nhas  had  a record of lower default rate than banks, and  the\r\n\r\nmodel  seems to be working for Hong Kong.  We should  try  to\r\n\r\nduplicate it here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I have mentioned this before, and that is to make\r\n\r\nit easier for companies to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraise funds from public markets, and I am suggesting that  we\r\n\r\nset  up  an over the counter or \"bulletin board\" concept  for\r\n\r\ncompanies  of  risky nature to raise funds from  the  public.\r\n\r\nSGX  should  be  compelled to take the responsibility  to  do\r\n\r\nthis,  and listing requirements should be simple and  not  so\r\n\r\nstringent  and costs need to be low enough for  companies  to\r\n\r\nbenefit.   This  could  be an electronic  exchange  which  is\r\n\r\neasily accessible to everyone around the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the LEFS scheme, while we have achieved\r\n\r\nlimited  success, it has not effectively reached out to  many\r\n\r\ncompanies,   especially  those  in   the   early   stage   of\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  I would like to suggest that the LEFS scheme be\r\n\r\nexpanded  to  cover  the financing gap between  LEFS  and  VC\r\n\r\nfinancing.   In this respect, we should allow  VCs  or  angel\r\n\r\ninvestors to be included under the LEFS scheme via  a  hybrid\r\n\r\nsystem where the VCs and the investors provide cash in return\r\n\r\nfor  convertible loans or preferred shares. So  long  as  the\r\n\r\ninstrument  remains  as  a  loan,  the  investors  enjoy  80%\r\n\r\nguarantee  under  the LEFS scheme, and  they  too  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to draw upon the LEFS funds, as the banks  currently\r\n\r\nenjoy.   In  this  way, it will greatly  open  up  many  more\r\n\r\navenues  for financing, and it will allow the VCs  and  angel\r\n\r\ninvestors  to take greater risks, because the risk  is  being\r\n\r\nshared, as we are doing currently with the banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last cut is on Government-linked companies. I\r\n\r\nwas  recently  asked to chair a focus group to  look  at  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  role in business, as part of Mr  Raymond  Lim's\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation.   I\r\n\r\ninvited  key  people  from  the  private  sector,  academics,\r\n\r\njournalists and also from GLCs to be part of my committee.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to say  -  and I have said it many times before  - that  GLCs  have  played a useful role as  we  developed  our\r\n\r\nindustrial  economy,  and  we have created  some  world-class\r\n\r\ncompanies  like  SIA,  PSA and a few more.   My  focus  group\r\n\r\nconcluded,  quite unanimously, and this includes my  personal\r\n\r\nview,  that the GLCs can still play a useful role, but  their\r\n\r\nroles need to be changed and this will require significant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchanges on the part of GLCs and local private companies,  and\r\n\r\neveryone  needs  to  shift  from a mindset  of  distrust  and\r\n\r\ncompetition   to   one   of  partnership   and   cooperation,\r\n\r\nparticularly when the companies globalise.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nbe  constructive in my suggestions and this is in the  spirit\r\n\r\nof  creating excellence in all Singaporean companies, whether\r\n\r\nGLCs or private enterprises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few suggestions. Firstly, the focus for GLCs\r\n\r\nfrom  here  on  should  be to globalise,  because  they  have\r\n\r\nalready  harvested the domestic market quite extensively.   I\r\n\r\nam  not  advocating that they abandon the local  market,  but\r\n\r\nthey should get out of their comfort zones and look overseas.\r\n\r\nEach GLC should set a target of achieving a certain target of\r\n\r\nforeign  revenue, and the Government, through Temasek  should\r\n\r\ndrive this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when companies are corporatised from the\r\n\r\nGovernment, no moratorium or privileges should be given,  and\r\n\r\nmany  Members talked about some examples and PWD  is  one  of\r\n\r\nthem.   For  the corporatised entity's own good and  for  the\r\n\r\nsake  of  promoting  the spirit of private  enterprise,  they\r\n\r\nshould  compete  on  fair market practices.   The  Government\r\n\r\nshould also not allow corporatised entities to carry the name\r\n\r\nof  the  \"parent\" statutory board, so that they  do  not  get\r\n\r\nundue  advantage of the name, and there are many examples  of\r\n\r\nthis  happening.  PWD is one.  PSB Corporation is the  other.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  in the case of PSB, the parent had to  change  its\r\n\r\nname  to  SPRING, and PSB Corporation maintains its name  for\r\n\r\ncommercial purposes, I guess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Temasek, as the shareholder, should implement\r\n\r\nstricter corporate governance requirements for GLCs  that  it\r\n\r\nowns.   Practices  like  the recent  loan  given  by  one  of\r\n\r\nKeppel's subsidiaries to major shareholders do not look good,\r\n\r\nand  indicate inadequate controls from the Government,  as  a\r\n\r\nshareholder, through Temasek.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temasek should insist on strict financial goals for all\r\n\r\nGLCs and have a transparent system by sharing information\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the  public to erase the perception that GLCs  have  an\r\n\r\nunfair   advantage  and  are  governed  by  lower   corporate\r\n\r\nstandards.  The Minister mentioned yesterday that  the  GLCs,\r\n\r\nin   fact,  are  being  operated  very  professionally   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  there  is  no reason why  we  cannot  share  this\r\n\r\ninformation with everyone.  I believe there is a big  gap  in\r\n\r\nperception of what it really is and what some others think.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, many GLC captains originate from the civil\r\n\r\nservice  or  from the Armed Forces.  This is not a criticism,\r\n\r\nbut   a  fact.   Many  of  them  are  unlikely  to  take  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial   risks   necessary   to   create   excellent\r\n\r\nbusinesses simply because of their background and because  of\r\n\r\nwhat  they are used to.  Some do make the cut and are capable\r\n\r\nof  performing even better than the leaders from the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  but these are just a few who have made it.   I  urge\r\n\r\nTemasek  to  consider bringing in many more people  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector, either onto the boards of GLCs or hire people\r\n\r\nwith  true  private sector experience to head  the management\r\n\r\nteams of the GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, over the\r\n\r\npast  few  years, the Government Ministries  have  set  up  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  private  companies to provide  opportunities  for\r\n\r\ncivil  servants to have hands-on experience in  the  business\r\n\r\nworld, to create the entrepreneurship in them,  and to create\r\n\r\nmore   jobs  for  the  people.   This  is  something  to   be\r\n\r\nencouraged.   It  is  a kind of business  model.   But,  when\r\n\r\nthese  companies  are  set up, some  kind  of  protection  is\r\n\r\nprovided for them.  For example, when the PWD company was set\r\n\r\nup,  most of the Government projects and contracts were given\r\n\r\nto  this  company, without having to go through the tendering\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the other private sector construction companies,\r\n\r\nthis  is  unfair  competition.   I support  the  view  of  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh that this kind of protection  should  not  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to the Government-linked companies.  Private companies\r\n\r\ndo  not  have  this privilege.  For example,  when  Singapore\r\n\r\nPress  Holdings  set up its subsidiary companies  to  operate\r\n\r\nChannel I and Channel U,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto give its journalists the new challenge of working in a new\r\n\r\nbroadcasting medium,  they were given no special  privileges.\r\n\r\nThey  have to compete with the well-established Channel  News\r\n\r\nAsia, Channel 5 and Channel 8. This is fair competition.   In\r\n\r\norder  to  get more audience and viewership, all  journalists\r\n\r\nand  broadcasters have to do their best to squeeze and cudgel\r\n\r\ntheir  brain, to improve the quality of their programmes  and\r\n\r\nraise  their  standard.   Under  fair  competition,  all  the\r\n\r\nchannels,  be  it  Channel 5, Channel 8, Channel  News  Asia,\r\n\r\nChannel I or Channel U, every station strives to put up their\r\n\r\nbest performances, and achieved remarkable results. This is a\r\n\r\nwin-win situation policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Channel I and Channel U celebrated their first\r\n\r\nanniversary  recently, and the journalists  and  broadcasters\r\n\r\nfelt  very  proud of it, with a strong sense of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThrough  competition,  they  have  achieved  the  status   of\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  and they have created a good  image  for  their\r\n\r\ncompany  and  for their staff.  They have also generated  the\r\n\r\nchallenge that brings out the best in them.  I would like  to\r\n\r\ncongratulate all the staff involved in Channel U and  Channel\r\n\r\nI  over  the past year for their strong commitment  and  good\r\n\r\nwork  done under fair competition.  I hope they will continue\r\n\r\nto  work  hard  and  produce more  good  programmes  for  the\r\n\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was glad to hear the DPM saying that all companies\r\n\r\nmust  compete under fair conditions on a level playing field,\r\n\r\nso  as  to create the standard for fair competition.  Private\r\n\r\nenterprises do not have a 5-year protection or privileges.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister whether they would review  and\r\n\r\nconsider withdrawing the 5-year protection and privileges for\r\n\r\nGovernment companies.\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, Ministries and\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards should be helping businesses  to  grow.   I\r\n\r\njoin  my  colleague, Mr Inderjit Singh, to call on Ministries\r\n\r\nand statutory boards to desist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom starting in-house units to provide products and services\r\n\r\nthat  can  be  readily  supplied by private  businesses  that\r\n\r\nalready exist, unless special requirements exist.  If they do\r\n\r\nnot,  they are really withholding business opportunities  for\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector.  Sometimes, these in-house  units  even\r\n\r\ncompete with the private sector for businesses, and some  are\r\n\r\nsubsequently spun off as independent companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is PSB. There were many well-established\r\n\r\nprivate training institutions ready to work with it.  Yet, it\r\n\r\nset  up  its  own  in-house  unit  to  provide  the  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that it administered.  These units were  recently\r\n\r\nspun  off as PSB Corp.  In this particular case, it is  water\r\n\r\nunder  the bridge.  My two colleagues, who have just  spoken,\r\n\r\nhave  referred to other cases.  Government should not compete\r\n\r\nwith  the  private  sector.  Ministries and statutory  boards\r\n\r\nshould  concentrate  on their mission  and  core  activities.\r\n\r\nThey  should  outsource  their requirements  to  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  to  help  the private businesses  grow  stronger  and\r\n\r\nbigger,  so that companies not only operate in Singapore  but\r\n\r\nwhere  opportunities exist to expand overseas.   Keeping  yet\r\n\r\nagain   to   the  training  industry,  a  good   example   is\r\n\r\nInformatics.  The company not only operates in Singapore  but\r\n\r\nhas  successfully expanded into the region, and recently into\r\n\r\nChina as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, under section 328 of\r\n\r\nthe  Companies  Act,  if  a company  goes  into  liquidation,\r\n\r\nworkers'  claims  will  be given priority  as  they  will  be\r\n\r\ntreated as preferred creditors.  This means that their claims\r\n\r\nfor  any remuneration will have priority over other unsecured\r\n\r\ncreditors.   The  same situation applies when  a  company  is\r\n\r\nplaced   under  receivership.   Workers'  claims  will   have\r\n\r\npriority  over unsecured creditors under section 226  of  the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale for this is clearly to mitigate the\r\n\r\nhardship  that workers face when a company winds up and  they\r\n\r\nare left without a job and without any means of sustenance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the preferential treatment for workers' claims\r\n\r\ndoes not apply when a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompany   is   placed  under  judicial  management.    Hence,\r\n\r\nemployees  are  treated  as  unsecured  creditors   for   any\r\n\r\nremuneration  which has accrued prior to the  making  of  the\r\n\r\njudicial management order.  This is because employees do  not\r\n\r\nfall under any of the exceptions specified under section 227G\r\n\r\n(6)(b)  of the Companies Act.  Section 227G (6)(b) authorises\r\n\r\nthe  judicial  manager  to discharge  the  debts  of  certain\r\n\r\nsecured creditors, but workers' claims are not included.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, what happens is that the judicial manager\r\n\r\nwould  usually  seek an order of court to give the  employees\r\n\r\npreferred  creditor status with respect to their pre-judicial\r\n\r\nmanagement  claims.   In such a case, the  payments  will  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  as preferred payments made out of the  assets  of\r\n\r\nthe company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court has usually granted such an order but it is\r\n\r\ncumbersome,   time-consuming   and   actually   means    that\r\n\r\nunnecessary costs are incurred which could instead be used to\r\n\r\nsettle the debts of the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I wish to urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  amending the Companies Act to give workers'  claims\r\n\r\nwhen   a   company   is  placed  under  judicial   management\r\n\r\npreferential treatment, on a similar basis as section 328  of\r\n\r\nthe Companies Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This last recession has affected many workers badly.\r\n\r\nMany  companies  went into liquidation, receivership  or  are\r\n\r\nplaced   under  judicial  management.  Workers'   hard-earned\r\n\r\nsalaries  should  at least be given some  priority  in  these\r\n\r\nsituations,  without  having to  go  through  the  hassle  of\r\n\r\npersuading  the judicial manager to secure a court  order  to\r\n\r\npay.   In  fact, many of these workers continue to work  with\r\n\r\nthe   company   even  after  it  is  placed  under   judicial\r\n\r\nmanagement.  Hence, it is only logical that their  claims  be\r\n\r\ngiven  preferential treatment.  I would  like  to  urge  once\r\n\r\nagain  that  the Minister consider amending the Act  to  give\r\n\r\nworkers   in  companies  which  are  placed  under   judicial\r\n\r\nmanagement  the same status as those under liquidation  under\r\n\r\nsection 328.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, data and\r\n\r\ninformation  are  the  lifeblood of an  information  economy.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is in the forefront in this area.  The  Government\r\n\r\nis  the repository of much information provided by the public\r\n\r\nthrough  many of its services that it provides.  It asks  the\r\n\r\npublic   to   supply   particulars  and   information   about\r\n\r\nthemselves.   Sometimes,  it  is  also  statutory,  such   as\r\n\r\ninformation  that  might be provided to  various  Ministries,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the Ministry of Defence, for example, for enlistment\r\n\r\npurposes and recall purposes, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the value of such information, both to the State as\r\n\r\nwell  as to the economy, is immense, and in a knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy,  this  is increasingly so.  In recent  weeks,  there\r\n\r\nhave  been  cases that we see in the media where  information\r\n\r\nprovided  to certain Ministries seems to have been passed  on\r\n\r\nor  related for certain commercial uses, such that members of\r\n\r\nthe  public  may  receive  in their  mail  information  about\r\n\r\ncommercial  services that originate out of  that  information\r\n\r\nbeing  passed  on by certain Government bodies  to  whom  the\r\n\r\ninformation was supplied in the first place.  This gives rise\r\n\r\nto  the  concern among some members of the public as  to  the\r\n\r\nconfidentiality   of  this  information.    No   doubt,   the\r\n\r\ninformation  is  necessary for those statutory  purposes  for\r\n\r\nwhich they are supplied in the first place.  And through  the\r\n\r\nuse of information technology, there is much to be gained  in\r\n\r\nterms   of  efficiency  through  the  channelling   of   this\r\n\r\ninformation,  and the coordination of this  could  also  save\r\n\r\nmuch  trouble  for  members of the public when  services  are\r\n\r\nprovided to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key then would be how best can we further improve on\r\n\r\nour  laws  in  the  area  of data confidentiality  such  that\r\n\r\ninformation that is provided by members of the public, by the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  the State, could then be dealt  with  in  total\r\n\r\nconfidence,  so  that members of the public would  know  that\r\n\r\nwithout  their  express consent, that this information  would\r\n\r\nthen  not in any way be channelled to parties for which  they\r\n\r\ndo not wish the information to be made known.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also mention this because, with the increasing\r\n\r\nuse of economic value of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  information,  we  have seen in  other  societies  where\r\n\r\ninformation purchased through e-commerce have been amassed by\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  the private sector and subsequently  sold  for\r\n\r\neconomic reasons.  Again, as Singapore progresses in the area\r\n\r\nof  e-commerce and as we encourage development in this  area,\r\n\r\nthe enhancement of our laws in this area would further add to\r\n\r\nthe robustness of our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Sir, first, I would like to take the issue about Government's\r\n\r\nrole  in  business, an issue that is raised  by  Mr  Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh, Dr Tan Boon Wan and Mr Ang Mong Seng.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general principle, we agree that statutory boards\r\n\r\nand  Government  departments should stay away from  business.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  the  role  of  the Government  to  compete  with\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  As a general principle, we agree with that.  But\r\n\r\nthe Government's role goes beyond just regulating the system.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  not possible to follow what Mr Inderjit says  and\r\n\r\njust  ask  the  statutory  boards  to  stick  to  regulation.\r\n\r\nBecause the statutory boards and Government departments  also\r\n\r\ndo promotion and provide services.  Sometimes, in the process\r\n\r\nof  promoting an industry, they need to get involved with the\r\n\r\nindustry.   For  example, EDB, IDA, they are  promoting  that\r\n\r\nparticular  sector,  so  they have to  get  involved  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other statutory boards provide services. You can either\r\n\r\nprovide  the  services in-house or you can buy  the  services\r\n\r\nfrom  outside.   Again,  as  a  general  rule,  we  tell  our\r\n\r\ndepartments  and statutory boards that they should  outsource\r\n\r\nfrom  the  private  sector.  But,  on  the  other  hand,  our\r\n\r\ndepartments  and statutory boards also want to be  efficient,\r\n\r\nand  if  in their calculation, providing it in-house is  more\r\n\r\nefficient, I think we should not stop them from doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two examples, which the Members raised about PSB\r\n\r\nCorp  and  PWD  Corp, they are a different type  of  problem.\r\n\r\nThese are departments or statutory boards which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been providing these services for many years.  PWD  has\r\n\r\nbeen  around  for more than 100 years; PSB, when  they  first\r\n\r\nstarted,  we did not have the same equivalent private  sector\r\n\r\ninfrastructure and support providing all this training.   And\r\n\r\nwhen PSB launched the productivity movement, this concept was\r\n\r\nvery new, and to provide the training, they have to do it in-house.   Having done so for many years, and having  built  up\r\n\r\nthe  capability  in-house, we now realise that  this  can  be\r\n\r\nbetter  done by the private sector.  I think everybody agrees\r\n\r\nthat there is no reason why the Government should continue to\r\n\r\nhave  an  in-house consultancy department, like the  PWD,  or\r\n\r\nthat Government should have training courses done in-house by\r\n\r\nPSB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is, how do you move this to the private\r\n\r\nsector?   There are many options.  One way is to  just  close\r\n\r\ndown PWD, even though they may have 100 years of history;  or\r\n\r\nclose  down PSB training department.  But you demolish  value\r\n\r\nin  doing so.  In the case of PWD, we decided that in future,\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments will buy services  from  outside  and\r\n\r\nthat PWD should be corporatised and privatised.  The question\r\n\r\nis, how do you transit to that stage?  So we decided that, in\r\n\r\norder  not  to destroy value, we allow PWD to be  privatised.\r\n\r\nIn  doing so, we give them a five-year moratorium.  So it  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  situation,  as  Mr Ang Mong Seng  described,  of  PWD\r\n\r\nsetting   up  a  subsidiary  and  being  given  a   five-year\r\n\r\nprotection.   I can understand why some Members  have  raised\r\n\r\nthis  issue because they are presenting the perspective  from\r\n\r\nthe private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me also tell Members there are two other\r\n\r\nperspectives  that  we  can  look  at.   One  is   from   the\r\n\r\nperspective  of the Government - the other departments  which\r\n\r\nare  being  serviced; and the second perspective is  actually\r\n\r\nthe  people  who work in this organisation themselves.   From\r\n\r\nthe  private sector perspective, having PWD going out to  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector means more competition, and they are not  very\r\n\r\nhappy.   The  counter-argument is, if we have not  privatised\r\n\r\nPWD,  all these jobs that PWD is now doing outside would have\r\n\r\nbeen done in-house.  So the private\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsector  is not going to get a bigger cake, in any case.   But\r\n\r\nwhen  we privatised PWD, in fact, the moratorium is a limited\r\n\r\nmoratorium.  PWD was given the moratorium for projects  above\r\n\r\n$20   million.   Anything  below  $20  million,  it  is  free\r\n\r\ncompetition.  So when we moved PWD to the private sector,  we\r\n\r\ndid not give PWD the full slate of its original mandate.   We\r\n\r\ngive  them  only those projects which are above $20  million,\r\n\r\nand   we  say  that  anything  below  $20  million  is   free\r\n\r\ncompetition.  And the reason why we decided on the cut off at\r\n\r\n$20  million  is because during this period,  there  is  huge\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in schools, and most of the school projects  and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure projects of that level (roads, etc) are  below\r\n\r\n$20 million.  So that gives more work to the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, unfortunately, of course, in the present decline in\r\n\r\nthe  construction  sector,  one can  understand  the  private\r\n\r\nsector being unhappy that they only get the $20 million  part\r\n\r\nof the cake.  They probably wish to have a bigger part of the\r\n\r\npie.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at it from the perspective of the people who\r\n\r\nwork in PWD, they have built up PWD for so many years, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  fair,  as Mr Inderjit suggested, that when we  privatise\r\n\r\nsuch  entities, that they should not carry their name.   This\r\n\r\nis goodwill; this is value.  PWD has a name.  Why should they\r\n\r\nnow adopt a new name and destroy value?  It is just like PSA.\r\n\r\nWhen  we corporatise, and later on we privatise PSA, are  you\r\n\r\nsuggesting that PSA should not use \"PSA\" (the name)?  We  are\r\n\r\njust intentionally destroying value.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I do not think the issue is whether the name is\r\n\r\nretained.  I think the issue is that when they privatise,  we\r\n\r\ndeal  with them at arm's length and that they compete  fairly\r\n\r\nand  without special privileges.  If you look at it from  the\r\n\r\nperspective of the other Government agencies which are  being\r\n\r\nserved  by  PWD,  they have all these years  had  an  inhouse\r\n\r\nconsultancy department.  When we privatised PWD, we also want\r\n\r\nto  make sure that the various Ministries running the  school\r\n\r\nprogramme, the road programme and the various\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  infrastructure  and  building  programmes,  are  still\r\n\r\ngetting proper service, and therefore this moratorium  period\r\n\r\nallows all the various Government agencies to be assured that\r\n\r\nwhen  the  whole  thing is opened up,  they  still  have  the\r\n\r\nservice which they originally enjoyed from inhouse but now by\r\n\r\nPWD  Corp.   Anyway, this is only for five  years  and  after\r\n\r\nthat, it will be free competition, and all the projects  will\r\n\r\nbe awarded based on merit and open tender.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is similar for PSB Corp. As I have\r\n\r\nexplained earlier, it started off as an inhouse training  for\r\n\r\nproductivity  education  and for the  productivity  movement.\r\n\r\nHaving  built  that up, do we destroy the  value,  or  do  we\r\n\r\nprivatise it?  And as we privatise it, why not allow them  to\r\n\r\nkeep the name \"PSB Corp\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also asked for Government to be lean\r\n\r\nand  to  emphasise on productivity and efficiency.   I  think\r\n\r\nthat  is indeed our intention and the civil service has  been\r\n\r\nin  the  forefront  of many innovative changes  to  make  the\r\n\r\nGovernment more efficient and more productive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh questioned the 5.6% GDP spending on\r\n\r\nGovernment.  That component reflected the central  Ministries\r\n\r\n-  Ministry  of Law, Ministry of Finance and also  Organs  of\r\n\r\nState  - and within that big element, there is also a  budget\r\n\r\nset  aside  for land reclamation under the Ministry  of  Law.\r\n\r\nThat explains the 5.6% of GDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, if you look at the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nexpenditure, our operating expenditure at 10% of GDP  is  one\r\n\r\nof  the lowest among the developed countries.  But that  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  we  are  complacent.  It is just  to  give  you  a\r\n\r\nbenchmark that we are very conscious of the level of spending\r\n\r\nwithin  the  Government, and we will  keep  this  as  low  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also suggested that even though we\r\n\r\nstrive  for  the  lowest  tenderer  in  all  our  procurement\r\n\r\nprocedures we should sometimes facilitate the development  of\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs.   He knows that we are doing so in a limited  way,\r\n\r\nalthough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  do insist on proper procedures in calling of tenders  and\r\n\r\nthe awarding to the lowest tender.  We do allow public sector\r\n\r\nagencies  to  contract start-up companies with  no  company's\r\n\r\ntrack  record  for IT and technology projects  of  up  to  $5\r\n\r\nmillion.  So in normal tender procedures, if you do not  have\r\n\r\nany  track  record,  you  will be disqualified.   But  we  do\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  in such areas, if you want  to  encourage  a\r\n\r\nstart-up,  then  you  should give such companies  a  fighting\r\n\r\nchance and therefore we waive the need for a company's  track\r\n\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also suggested a test-bed for projects\r\n\r\nso  as to give these companies a leg-up in their development.\r\n\r\nHe  acknowledged  that  we do have  this  entity  called  The\r\n\r\nEnterprise  Challenge  which provides sponsorships  for  test\r\n\r\nbedding  and  we try to identify suitable pilot  test  sites.\r\n\r\nWhether the idea comes from the public sector, or the private\r\n\r\nsector, or the people sector, it really does not matter.   So\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Challenge was set up in March 2000.  This is a\r\n\r\n$10 million fund and so far it has sponsored 32 projects with\r\n\r\nthe  private sector accounting for 13 of these projects.   To\r\n\r\nrecognise innovation, The Enterprise Challenge also  recently\r\n\r\ncreated  this $1,000 Innovator Award which is given to  every\r\n\r\napproved project for test bedding.  So it is an idea that  we\r\n\r\nwill definitely pursue further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next set of suggestions from Mr Inderjit Singh is on\r\n\r\nhow  to  plug  the various gaps in our financial environment.\r\n\r\nAll  the  suggestions  are very good  suggestions.   We  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely  evaluate them.  I would just like to make  a  few\r\n\r\nshort  comments.  By and large, whether or not we use Temasek\r\n\r\nas a vehicle to provide this financing of risk capital - that\r\n\r\nhas  been  addressed  by  DPM last  night  -  basically,  our\r\n\r\napproach  is  that  Temasek is the holding  company  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  equity  investment in  companies  and  it  must\r\n\r\noperate  on  commercial principles.  So  we  should  not  ask\r\n\r\nTemasek to do national service.  If it is a public policy  to\r\n\r\nencourage or provide, or to seek some of this type  of  money\r\n\r\nfor financing, then this ought to be done by the Government,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough the statutory boards, or through the various agencies\r\n\r\nwithin the statutory boards.  So that is the first principle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, you will realise that Temasek has a\r\n\r\ncompany  to invest in venture capital fund and that,  as  DPM\r\n\r\nexplained  last night, together with what EDB  is  doing,  is\r\n\r\nreally to provide the seed or the catalyst.  And once we kick-start  the venture capital sector, we will expect the private\r\n\r\nsector to be on its own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion which Mr Inderjit Singh raised is\r\n\r\nabout  encouraging or compelling the banks to  provide  loans\r\n\r\nbased  on  cashflow principles, rather than on collateral  or\r\n\r\nguarantee.   It  is  very  difficult  for  us  to  compel  or\r\n\r\nincentivise the commercial banks.  They must be allowed to do\r\n\r\nso  on  their own commercial calculations.  Among the various\r\n\r\nbanks  that  we  have, some would take this  up  as  a  niche\r\n\r\nmarket, that the SMEs is the sector worth servicing, no doubt\r\n\r\nit is higher risk.  But if you build up a core competence and\r\n\r\ndomain  knowledge of the SMEs, this is an area where you  can\r\n\r\ndo  well  and  be  competitive.  We should leave  it  to  the\r\n\r\ncommercial  banks to respond to the commercial needs  of  the\r\n\r\nSMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the specific suggestion about banks which are set\r\n\r\nup  just  for SMEs, like what they have in Hong Kong the  SME\r\n\r\nLoan,  this  is  something that we would definitely  explore.\r\n\r\nBasically,  MAS would facilitate or encourage such  financial\r\n\r\nentities  to  Singapore  as  long  as  they  meet  the   MAS'\r\n\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh's other suggestion about the bulletin\r\n\r\nboard is also a good suggestion.  We would ask SGX to look at\r\n\r\nhis  proposal.  Basically, both the Mainboard and Sesdaq, the\r\n\r\nrules  for  listing  and the rules for  raising  capital  are\r\n\r\nalready fairly liberal.  But if there is scope for a bulletin\r\n\r\nboard  which  allows  other companies to  raise  capital,  in\r\n\r\nprinciple,  we do not see any objections to  it.   If  it  is\r\n\r\nviable,  we will allow this to be operated, again as long  as\r\n\r\nthey meet the MAS' regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final segment is on the GLCs and the role of the\r\n\r\nGLCs.   I  am much encouraged by Mr Inderjit Singh's preamble\r\n\r\nabout the GLCs.  Again, as DPM said last\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnight,  most  of  the  GLCs  we  have  grew  because  of  our\r\n\r\ndevelopmental   history,  because  of   the   way   Singapore\r\n\r\ndeveloped.   As a matter of principle, we will be  much  more\r\n\r\nreluctant   now   to  ask  our  statutory  boards,   or   our\r\n\r\ndepartments,  to build up new companies.  But  we  have  this\r\n\r\nstable   of  very  good  companies,  good  leadership,   good\r\n\r\nmanagement,  so  how do we transit?  Some we  will  keep  for\r\n\r\nstrategic reasons and others we will gradually divest to  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.  The challenge is to find investors and, more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  management teams to lead  these  entities.   We\r\n\r\nagree  entirely with Mr Inderjit Singh that these GLCs should\r\n\r\nmove  out of their comfort zone, that they should go regional\r\n\r\nor  global,  and  that they should observe  strict  corporate\r\n\r\ngovernance in the way they operate.  We subject them to  very\r\n\r\nstrict financial targets and goals and the Government  has  a\r\n\r\nrole  as  a  shareholder, through Temasek, to make sure  this\r\n\r\nhappens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the management of these GLCs, we leave it to the\r\n\r\nindividual companies and Temasek to pick the best people  for\r\n\r\nthe  team.   We do not run a system where we parachute  civil\r\n\r\nservants, or ex-SAF officers, into these companies.  It is up\r\n\r\nto  the  companies, it is up to Temasek, they evaluate  these\r\n\r\npeople  on  their own merits.  If these people are  suitable,\r\n\r\nthen  they  recruit them.  Similarly, the boards running  the\r\n\r\nGLC  companies,  again, the GLC companies and Temasek  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  board is a good board that can lead  the  company.\r\n\r\nThere is not a very high percentage of civil servants on  the\r\n\r\nboard.  It is less than 10%.  The GLCs and Temasek now make a\r\n\r\ndeliberate attempt to bring in foreign talent into the board.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  the  boards of our GLCs are largely  made  up  of\r\n\r\nprivate sector people who serve on these boards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah asked about the employee's rights during a\r\n\r\njudicial  management process.  I would like to  explain  that\r\n\r\nthe  liquidation process and the judicial management  process\r\n\r\nare  slightly  different.   In  a  liquidation  process,  the\r\n\r\ncompany  has gone bust and you want to distribute the  assets\r\n\r\nand  there  is  a  clear order of ranking to  distribute  the\r\n\r\nassets.  In a judicial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanagement  process,  they are still  hoping  to  revive  the\r\n\r\ncompany.  The judicial manager is appointed and his  task  is\r\n\r\nnot  just  to wind up the company and distribute the  assets.\r\n\r\nHis primary objective is really to revive the company and get\r\n\r\nit  started  so  that the employees continue  to  have  jobs.\r\n\r\nUnder  such  circumstances,  the  focus  is  not  on  how  to\r\n\r\ndistribute  your  assets, but really how to get  the  company\r\n\r\ngoing again.  Because of this objective, the Act is framed in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  way  that we give more flexibility to  the  judicial\r\n\r\nmanager   to   reorganise  the  company  and  rearrange   the\r\n\r\nliabilities and the assets in such a way that the company can\r\n\r\nbe  revived  as  a  going concern.  So  I  hope  the  workers\r\n\r\nunderstand the objectives of judicial management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chee How raised the issue about data\r\n\r\nconfidentiality.   I agree entirely with him  that  any  data\r\n\r\nwhich the Government agencies have obtained should be treated\r\n\r\nconfidentially, whether this data is obtained  through  IRAS,\r\n\r\nor through the hospitals, or through MINDEF.  But at the same\r\n\r\ntime, we must recognise that we do not want the Government to\r\n\r\ndevelop  into silos that every department and every  Ministry\r\n\r\nand  agency collects its data and refuses to share  its  data\r\n\r\nwith  other  agencies.  If we do that, then I am  afraid  the\r\n\r\nlevel of service provided by the Government will deteriorate.\r\n\r\nSo  the  question is: how do we strike a balance?  And within\r\n\r\nthe  civil service, we have very strict rules and  a  set  of\r\n\r\nprinciples of how we maintain data confidentiality but at the\r\n\r\nsame  time  we  do  share information across  Ministries  and\r\n\r\nacross agencies so that we provide a better public service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise Mr Heng's point that in this modern age,\r\n\r\ndata mining is very commercially lucrative but it is not  the\r\n\r\nintention of Government having access to this data  from  the\r\n\r\npeople to make use of this for commercial purposes.  Our main\r\n\r\nfocus is how to provide better service to the people.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, you have three cuts in\r\n\r\nall.  You can take them together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Yes, Sir. On financial standards, I\r\n\r\nwas  recently in the United States to attend a conference  on\r\n\r\nCorporate Governance for company directors.  Almost  everyone\r\n\r\nwas  seized by Enronitis.  It was instructive to observe  the\r\n\r\nvirtual paranoia amongst the non-executive directors  in  the\r\n\r\nwake  of  Enron  and other equally famous, or  should  I  say\r\n\r\ninfamous, cases like Kmart and Tyco.  I think there is now  a\r\n\r\ngreat  tendency to swing right towards more of  everything  - more  audits, more checks, more controls, more reporting  and\r\n\r\nthe list goes on.  Not only that, there is great lobbying for\r\n\r\nall  these measures to be imposed as \"best practices\", if not\r\n\r\nminimum standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there were questions raised on how to\r\n\r\nensure the independence of directors on boards, how to  check\r\n\r\nthe powers of executive chairmen and top management, how much\r\n\r\nstock  options to grant and how to account for stock options,\r\n\r\nhow  frequently to rotate auditors and how to achieve auditor\r\n\r\nindependence,   how  frequently  to  have  companies   report\r\n\r\nperformance,  and  how much detail to  be  included  in  such\r\n\r\npublic  reports.   These  are now questions  fired  in  rapid\r\n\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the root of the concern is more of a loss of trust\r\n\r\nand  confidence in boards and management than  of  inadequate\r\n\r\npractices or standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as we develop our own financial markets and study\r\n\r\nbest  practices  in the more established regimes,  we  should\r\n\r\ncarefully  review  the appropriateness of  standards  in  use\r\n\r\nelsewhere.   In defining our own standards, how do  we  guard\r\n\r\nagainst having an even more complicated or onerous form which\r\n\r\nwill  merely  raise compliance costs, but without necessarily\r\n\r\ngiving  the market the due benefits?  As it is, fund managers\r\n\r\nin  the US are beginning to feel that whilst they now will be\r\n\r\nreceiving  reams  and  yet  more  reams  of  these   detailed\r\n\r\ndisclosures, they are not any wiser nor any more assured that\r\n\r\nmanagement is indeed doing a good or better job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to ask the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister to enlighten the House on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  philosophy the Government is adopting with regard to the\r\n\r\nsetting of standards in corporate governance, disclosure  and\r\n\r\nthe auditing for companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Local Banks</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am moving on to the next cut on local banks. The\r\n\r\ninjection  of foreign expertise into our local banking  scene\r\n\r\ndeserves a lot more consideration.  Based on the response  to\r\n\r\na  query  on foreign ownership last week, I take it that  the\r\n\r\nMonetary  Authority of Singapore still has reservations  over\r\n\r\nallowing  greater equity participation in our local banks  by\r\n\r\nforeign  interests,  as it wanted to ensure  that  there  are\r\n\r\nenough locally owned banks to provide a stable base during  a\r\n\r\ncrisis.  Sir, this has different implications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one, it may imply that our local banks are obliged\r\n\r\nto \"stick-it-out\" with bad debts during a crisis.  Would this\r\n\r\nhave implications from a risk-management standpoint?  In  all\r\n\r\nfairness to non locally-owned banks, such as Malayan Banking,\r\n\r\nthey  have  remained  very much on the scene  through  recent\r\n\r\ncrises.   So,  the  link  of a controlling  interest  to  the\r\n\r\ndecision  to  operate  in  our  market  would  require   some\r\n\r\nverification and further analysis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second implication is really whether this limit to\r\n\r\nownership  is,  in  fact, a limiting factor  and,  therefore,\r\n\r\ndisadvantageous to the market as a whole.  As our  market  is\r\n\r\nrelatively  small and the range of services  narrow,  foreign\r\n\r\nbanks  with  a minority interest may not find it worth  their\r\n\r\nwhile  to introduce new services which may be products  being\r\n\r\noffered through their operations elsewhere.  The scope can be\r\n\r\nbewildering, given the convergence of retailing and  banking.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  many credit card issuers are now  providing  a\r\n\r\nwhole  host of other non-bank and financial services.  As  it\r\n\r\nis,  competition locally for the narrow range of services  is\r\n\r\nalready intense.  There appears to be some anecdotal evidence\r\n\r\nof this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to look at the refinement in capital adequacy\r\n\r\nrequirements  in recent years and note that  there  has  been\r\n\r\nmore emphasis on capital efficiency, we would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  noticed  that  most  of the banks  have  lowered  their\r\n\r\nCapital  Adequacy Ratios by a few percentage points to  where\r\n\r\nthey  are,  probably at around the mid to high teens  levels.\r\n\r\nYet, the returns on equity have not improved at all, and they\r\n\r\nhave  not actually surpassed the 10% ballpark.  The deduction\r\n\r\nis  either  that  the customer base cannot  afford  the  same\r\n\r\nservices  at  prevailing rates, or that  managers  just  have\r\n\r\ngotten  too  used  to  the  old ways  of  doing  business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many have lamented the lack of innovation and risk-taking on the part of banks, which is apparently made worse\r\n\r\nby the recent mergers.  Many also postulate that unless there\r\n\r\nis   a  revenue  boost  and  a  margin  explosion  from   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of new innovative products, the ROEs  of  banks\r\n\r\nwill  look  dull for a long time to come.  So, even  when  we\r\n\r\ndecide to lift foreign ownership limits in the future,  there\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  many  takers.   The related  issue  is  one  of\r\n\r\nreviewing  the  scope for expanding the variety  of  services\r\n\r\nwhich  would  have good margin potential.  For  example,  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development  Board is essentially  the  biggest\r\n\r\nmortgage player which, hitherto, is one of the most lucrative\r\n\r\nsegments  elsewhere.  Should the HDB be confined to  being  a\r\n\r\nhousing  agency  and development agency for  the  Government,\r\n\r\ninstead of running the biggest mortgage business?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the above concerns, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime Minister what are the real  arguments  for\r\n\r\nlimiting foreign participation in our local banks and how  we\r\n\r\ncan nurture innovation on our local banking scene.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now move on to my third cut on financial\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Financial services promotion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has expended a lot of efforts on\r\n\r\npromoting   financial  services  and  marketed  to   numerous\r\n\r\ninstitutions which are currently located elsewhere in Asia or\r\n\r\ndo not already have a presence in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Equity markets</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of equity markets, we have been trying to\r\n\r\nattract  regional companies to list on the Stock Exchange  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, citing the benefits of going public in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, this goes against the grain of listing in\r\n\r\nand allowing investors to trade in the country where the bulk\r\n\r\nof  revenue is generated or assets are based.  Besides,  many\r\n\r\nother  exchanges  are touting the same.  Understandably,  the\r\n\r\ndemand  side of the equation is important, and we would  need\r\n\r\nto define some niche industries or competence for which would-be investors would be prepared to trade with us and for which\r\n\r\nwe  can  create a meaningful critical mass.  For example,  we\r\n\r\ncould target infrastructural-related listings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Fund management/hedge funds</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, when promoting fund management,\r\n\r\nincluding  hedge  funds,  we would need  to  go  beyond  just\r\n\r\nproviding   the   business  infrastructure,   primarily   tax\r\n\r\nincentives.   As  we  do not have a great  hinterland  nor  a\r\n\r\nnatural  market, we would need to create some base  load  for\r\n\r\nthese  managers before the bigger players would even consider\r\n\r\nrelocating  or  setting up shop here.  For example,  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen promoting fund management activities since the mid-1990s\r\n\r\nand,  yet,  the  amounts being parcelled out  by  the  public\r\n\r\nsector are far from attractive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindset changes have regrettably lagged. Public\r\n\r\nagencies  would still prefer the tried and tested names  and,\r\n\r\ngenerally,  mandate  sizes are far too small.   Likewise,  to\r\n\r\ncreate  the necessary buzz in hedge fund activities,  we  may\r\n\r\nwant  to provide a base load for a diversified range of  much\r\n\r\nsmaller  players  who have the necessary energy,  instead  of\r\n\r\ngunning  for  the  big  players.  This will  require  a  bold\r\n\r\nprogramme which will involve taking more risks with  unproven\r\n\r\noperators  in an inherently risky business.  However,  if  we\r\n\r\ncan   do   it   on  a  big  enough  scale,  there   will   be\r\n\r\ndiversification and a few winners can pay for the failures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Deputy Prime Minister consider refining the\r\n\r\npromotional strategy for both these segments, especially with\r\n\r\nregard to creating local demand?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, I am heartened by\r\n\r\nthe various tax incentives in this year's Budget targetted at\r\n\r\nstrengthening  the competitiveness of our  wealth  and  asset\r\n\r\nmanagement  industries.  If we are seriously  going  for  the\r\n\r\ngoal  of building a world-class financial hub, we would  need\r\n\r\nto  expand  our  derivatives market and deepen  our  existing\r\n\r\ncapital markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incentives that have direct impact on taxation of\r\n\r\nbanks  are  the  consolidation of existing  financial  sector\r\n\r\nincentives into an umbrella Financial Sector Incentive (FSI).\r\n\r\nCurrently, the preparation of a bank's tax return is  complex\r\n\r\nand  time consuming, due to the application of different  tax\r\n\r\nrates  to  different products and units.  The new  scheme  is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  simplify the tax system and should,  therefore,\r\n\r\nreduce compliance costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that, at present, the regulatory\r\n\r\nreturns   and   tax  returns  do  not  provide   a   seamless\r\n\r\ntransference of information from one return to another.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  revenue  from  financial institutions  comes  from\r\n\r\nmultiple  sources, both on-shore and off-shore.   To  qualify\r\n\r\nfor  the  concessionary  rate of tax requires  administrative\r\n\r\ntime and cost in splitting incomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am mindful of the intention to merge several of the 11\r\n\r\nexisting  incentives  into  a single  umbrella  scheme.   The\r\n\r\nscheme,   as  the  Budget  Statement  says,  will   offer   a\r\n\r\nconcessionary tax rate of 5% for \"qualifying high growth  and\r\n\r\nhigh  value-added activities\", and 10% for \"mature  but  tax-sensitive activities.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does appear that financial institutions may have to\r\n\r\ngrapple with further regulatory and definitional issues, like\r\n\r\n\"qualifying  high  growth activities\"  and  \"mature  but  tax\r\n\r\nsensitive activities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the above, I would like to ask the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  the  following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) How will the revamping of the existing incentives be\r\n\r\nmore attractive to existing financial institutions?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Does the FSI cover all products or only a few\r\n\r\nselected ones?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Will the proposed FSI attract more financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions and advisers into Singapore and, if so, how?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Will the proposed FSI result in higher compliance\r\n\r\ncosts, both in the revamp and thereafter?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, credit-card billings in the year 2001 totalled $11 billion, up 5%\r\n\r\nfrom  $10.6  billion  in the year 2000  and  exceeding  total\r\n\r\nbillings  of around $8.9 billion in 1999.

In  short,\r\n\r\nalthough  we  were in an economic downturn  last  year,  more\r\n\r\npeople  are getting credit cards, using them and chalking  up\r\n\r\nbad debts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to highlight four cases across four media reports\r\n\r\nin  the Straits Times which should give us something to think\r\n\r\nabout.

The\r\n\r\ndifficulty is to strike a balance between\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhaving  a  set  of  standards which are  comparable  to  best\r\n\r\npractices elsewhere and having a set which is not so  onerous\r\n\r\nthat,  in our circumstances, we are not able to get  them  to\r\n\r\nwork  and we are just going through the form and the  motion,\r\n\r\nrather  than actually to maintain high standards of corporate\r\n\r\ngovernance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no magic answer to this. Our approach is to\r\n\r\ninvolve the private sector when we review our standards so as\r\n\r\nto  help  ensure that the recommendations are  in  line  with\r\n\r\nmarket  practices and are practical and worth doing.   Before\r\n\r\nsubmitting reports, review committees would normally  conduct\r\n\r\nextensive   public   consultation,  solicit   feedback   from\r\n\r\nstakeholders so that we could get the widest range of  views.\r\n\r\nI  ought to say, however, that there have been occasions when\r\n\r\nwe  have  not got as much and as timely feedback  as  we  had\r\n\r\nhoped  to  get.   After we have settled the  recommendations,\r\n\r\nthen  people say, \"I am sorry.  I should have told  you  this\r\n\r\nearlier but there is this problem\".  Where there has  been  a\r\n\r\nserious problem, we had to go back and undo and redo. I  urge\r\n\r\nthe  industry  to take the feedback seriously  and  the  more\r\n\r\neffort  you put in and the more candid you are in your views,\r\n\r\nthe more we will be able to come up with standards which will\r\n\r\nbe effective and worthwhile.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for form versus substance, in our capital market\r\n\r\nstandards,   our  current  standards  follow  generally   the\r\n\r\ninternational  financial reporting standards  (IFRS),  rather\r\n\r\nthan the US generally accepted accounting principle or the US\r\n\r\nGAAP.   Our  desired outcome is for companies  to  comply  in\r\n\r\nsubstance,  and not just in form.  We also require  effective\r\n\r\nenforcement actions on the one hand and active involvement of\r\n\r\nthe  private sector on the other, so that we can improve  our\r\n\r\ncorporate  governance  and disclosure  practices  over  time.\r\n\r\nThis is something which has to happen over time and cannot be\r\n\r\ndone  overnight just by fiat.  It is not just the  rules  but\r\n\r\nalso the norms and practices, the seriousness in which people\r\n\r\ntake  these  rules and the depth of understanding  when  they\r\n\r\nimplement, and their sense of responsibility - when something\r\n\r\ngoes wrong, to put the flag up so that it can be put right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On foreign banks and whether we are hindering innovation\r\n\r\nby  restricting the foreign banks from investing in Singapore\r\n\r\nbanks,  our  philosophy is not to prevent foreign banks  from\r\n\r\nparticipating  in the industry altogether,  but  to  maintain\r\n\r\nlocal  control of the main local banks. There  are  now  only\r\n\r\nthree  main  local banks.  There can be foreign participation\r\n\r\nin  them, but not a controlling stake, and the reason is  not\r\n\r\nthat we want local banks to do national service, but that  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  align the interest of the local banks substantially\r\n\r\nwith  the long-term interest of the Singapore economy so that\r\n\r\nin  a  crisis,  they will calculate their interest  and  will\r\n\r\nthereby  further the interest of Singapore.   They  will  not\r\n\r\nupstage  and  leave,  or say, \"I just  cut  losses,  fighting\r\n\r\nanother day somewhere else.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the problem of range of services has to\r\n\r\ndo  with whether the foreign banks can or cannot buy into the\r\n\r\nlocal banks because they are present here.  They have 40%  of\r\n\r\nthe  market, and through their own branches and their own ATM\r\n\r\nnetworks now, they are able to provide quite a wide range  of\r\n\r\nservices.   In  fact, they have been quite innovative,  maybe\r\n\r\nnot  the  same  services  that you can  find  in  their  home\r\n\r\ncountries, but that could be as much due to cultural  reasons\r\n\r\nand  mindset  and infrastructure, as it is  due  to  lack  of\r\n\r\nmarket  opportunity.  In fact, some of the foreign banks  are\r\n\r\nextremely  aggressive.  I have heard that they  even  set  up\r\n\r\nstalls  on  five-foot ways on Saturday afternoons  and  press\r\n\r\npeople  with  application forms.  I have heard this,  not  as\r\n\r\ninformation, but as complaints.  But that is the way  it  is.\r\n\r\nIf  it gets out of hand, the people in charge of touting will\r\n\r\nlook into the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the low ROEs of our local banks, I think it is\r\n\r\nearly  days yet.  It has only been three years.  As  we  have\r\n\r\nopened  up  the market, there has been increased  competition\r\n\r\nand  the  opportunities for lending have not been that  great\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  economic downturn and the local  banks  are\r\n\r\ngrappling  with  the  change and upgrading  and  diversifying\r\n\r\nthemselves into fee-based income sources.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  have  just made their mergers and there are some  costs\r\n\r\ninvolved with the mergers and rationalisation.  I think  that\r\n\r\ngiven time, they should be able to improve their returns  and\r\n\r\ntheir standards.  Our objective in banking liberalisation  is\r\r\n\r\nto  encourage  more  innovation by progressively  introducing\r\n\r\ncompetition, but we cannot just pursue innovation  and  risk-taking  on  their own. We have to understand what  the  risks\r\n\r\nare, understand them well and manage them well too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for promoting equity markets and hedge funds and\r\n\r\ncreating  local  demand,  I  agree  with  Mrs  Lim  that  for\r\n\r\npromoting  the equity and debt markets, there is a  role  for\r\n\r\nthe public sector to start the ball rolling and to generate a\r\n\r\ncertain  base  load. We have done this for  the  debt  market\r\n\r\nbecause  quite  a  number of the statutory boards  have  been\r\n\r\nmaking significant bond issues in recent years and the market\r\n\r\nhas  grown  substantially.  In fact, we have been successful,\r\n\r\nnot  only in promoting the bond market, but also in the whole\r\n\r\nfund management industry in Singapore.  In 10 years, the fund\r\n\r\nmanagement  industry has grown 15-fold, from $18  billion  in\r\n\r\n1990  to  $276 billion last year.  Our debt market has  grown\r\n\r\nsubstantially  too. Our survey shows that  the  bulk  of  the\r\n\r\ndiscretionary  assets  that  are  managed  in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\ninvested  in  Asia, and 30% of them are invested  here.   The\r\n\r\namount of investments traded in Singapore by fund managers is\r\n\r\nnot insignificant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for hedge funds, we promote them, but we do not have\r\n\r\nvery  good  statistics on them because it  is  hard  to  tell\r\n\r\nexactly  what  is a hedge fund and what is just  an  ordinary\r\n\r\nfund  manager.   But  we have seen more hedge  fund  managers\r\n\r\nsetting up or expanding here and now Singapore is one of  the\r\n\r\nsignificant hedge fund markets in the region. There are  four\r\n\r\n-  Japan,  Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore -  and  we  are\r\n\r\ndefinitely one of them.  If we took five or ten years ago, we\r\n\r\nwere not at all on the map.  We recently announced the merger\r\n\r\nof  the approved fund manager and the approved boutique  fund\r\n\r\nmanager  schemes  in this year's Budget and I  am  optimistic\r\n\r\nthese new incentives will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelp  to  attract  some  of these boutique  hedge  funds  and\r\n\r\nspecialist  hedge fund managers, which Mrs Lim speaks  about,\r\n\r\nto set up in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked about our new tax incentives,\r\n\r\nwhether  they  would be attractive, what they cover  and  how\r\n\r\ntheir  compliance cost would be.  The approach in our  review\r\n\r\nfor  the  financial sector and tax incentives is  firstly  to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  incentives so that we are still competitive  in\r\n\r\nthe  new  landscape and, secondly, to rationalise the current\r\n\r\nrange  of  incentives so that it is easier to administer  and\r\n\r\ncomply with, precisely the point that Mdm Ho raised.  We will\r\n\r\nbe  placing  greater emphasis on high growth and high  value-added  activities and for these activities, we will  apply  a\r\n\r\nconsistent concessionary rate of 5%, which is lower than  the\r\n\r\nexisting 10% rate enjoyed by most of the financial activities\r\n\r\ncurrently  incentivised.  This lower 5%  rate  will  directly\r\n\r\nbenefit   many  of  the  high  value-added  activities   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  aiming  for.  The harmonised  incentives  will\r\n\r\nensure  that, where there are existing schemes which overlap,\r\n\r\nthey  will be simplified for ease of administration and  lead\r\n\r\nto lower compliance cost.  How we will harmonise, how we will\r\n\r\nwork  it  out  will  take some time.  We  will  announce  the\r\n\r\ndetails,  we  hope, in about six months' time.   We  are  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to have a sunset clause on the overall scheme, but  we\r\n\r\nwill have incentives awarded to individual institutions which\r\n\r\nwill  have  specific expiry dates attached and the length  of\r\n\r\nthe  incentive will be based on criteria such as the kind  of\r\n\r\nactivities  or the skill sets which they bring to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSuch  an expiry date will provide us the means to target  new\r\n\r\nactivities for promotion as the industry changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked about credit cards and young\r\n\r\npeople's  easy access to credit cards and unsecured  personal\r\n\r\ncredit  lines.  I agree completely with his concerns  because\r\n\r\nan  individual with many unsecured credit card lines is going\r\n\r\nto be tempted to spend beyond his means.  Borrowing on credit\r\n\r\ncards  and  unsecured  credit is very  expensive  and  if  an\r\n\r\nindividual does not have enough means to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrepay  his loans, he would soon see his debts piling  up  and\r\n\r\nthey  would come and look for us, as MPs, to help  them  sort\r\n\r\nout  their problem.  As Dr Amy Khor told us recently, a young\r\n\r\nlady came to see her and she had built up $20,000-$30,000  of\r\n\r\ncredit  card  debts, six cards.  She asked this  constituent,\r\n\r\n\"Why  did you do it?\"  The constituent said, \"hua de shi  hou\r\n\r\nheng  shuang!\" - when she spent it, it felt good.   Now,  she\r\n\r\nhas  to  look for her MP.  Therefore, MAS only allows  credit\r\n\r\ncards  and unsecured credit facilities to individuals with  a\r\n\r\nminimum  of $30,000 in annual income and even then,  we  have\r\n\r\nlimited  the maximum credit that can be extended on a  credit\r\n\r\ncard on unsecured personal lines to two months of income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, it is not watertight because consumers\r\n\r\ncan  still apply for multiple credit lines and add up to  far\r\n\r\nmore  than  two  months of income.  We need  some  system  to\r\n\r\nprevent  individuals from having too large a credit  exposure\r\n\r\nthrough credit cards, multiple cards.  We are going to launch\r\n\r\na  Singapore Consumer Credit Bureau in September this year to\r\n\r\npool  borrowing and repayment history of customers  and  give\r\n\r\nlenders  the  list of profiles of borrowers.  When  it  comes\r\n\r\ninto operation, the card issuers will be able to monitor  the\r\n\r\nnumber of credit cards which each of its customers holds, his\r\n\r\ntotal  credit  exposure  and his credit  history.   The  card\r\n\r\nissuers  can  then  manage the risk  exposure  and  use  this\r\n\r\ninformation when deciding whether to grant him another credit\r\n\r\ncard.  MAS will also encourage the card issuers to be prudent\r\n\r\nand to make full use of this information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo asked why interest rates on credit cards are 24%,\r\n\r\nuniform across all issuers.  MAS' understanding is that it is\r\n\r\nnot  actually uniform.  Not all cards charge 24%.   Some  are\r\n\r\nlower,  but these are interest rates which are determined  by\r\n\r\nthe  market.  I think it is a competitive market.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany  players, certainly more players than there  are  petrol\r\n\r\nstation  companies.  It is really not for the  Government  to\r\n\r\nsay  whether  this  is or is not at the right  level  because\r\n\r\ncredit cards are not a basic necessity and there is no reason\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  intervene  to  ensure  that  it  remains\r\n\r\naffordable. One reason that the lending rate is high, 24%  or\r\n\r\nthereabouts is because the default rate is significant.  When\r\n\r\nyou  borrow  from a credit card company, if  you  are  paying\r\n\r\nregularly   and  paying  interest,  you  are  really   cross-subsidising  the  other  credit  card  customers   who   have\r\n\r\ndefaulted  on  their borrowing.  And because the  default  is\r\n\r\nsignificant,  5% or 6%, so the interest has to be  high.  The\r\n\r\nadvice  to  you is, if you do not have to borrow,  especially\r\n\r\nfrom a credit card company, better don't.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more important than trying to push the rate down\r\n\r\nor  control the interest rate is for consumers to  know  what\r\n\r\ninterest  rate  they  are  actually  being  charged  and   to\r\n\r\nunderstand what other charges are being levied on them.   MAS\r\n\r\nrequires  credit  card issuers to clearly disclose  in  their\r\n\r\nmonthly statements all the late charges and relevant interest\r\n\r\nrates, and the Association of Banks has also acted to improve\r\n\r\ntransparency  of  fees and charges and terms and  conditions,\r\n\r\nand  they are putting out leaflets to explain in simple terms\r\n\r\nwhat  it involves, what are the terms and conditions, so that\r\n\r\nyou do not have to plough fine print and legalese and, at the\r\n\r\nend, to be none the wiser.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more can still be done and I urge the Association of\r\n\r\nBanks  to  look  into  developing  a  set  of  best  practice\r\n\r\nstandards on credit cards to take into account the  needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  public.   Then consumers can make an informed  decision,\r\n\r\nwhether they have the means to pay the principal, to pay  the\r\n\r\ninterest.  But finally individuals have to exercise  personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility to ensure he does not over extend himself  and\r\n\r\ndoes not live beyond his means.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Leong, do you want to withdraw your\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> I wish to thank the DPM and the\r\n\r\nSecond  Finance Minister for their patience and very detailed\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclear answers.

However,  there  are  those  who  by\r\n\r\nclassifications as middle income would still fall between the\r\n\r\ncracks  of the Budget, however fine the cracks may be.   Some\r\n\r\nof  these middle income earners, who do not benefit from  the\r\n\r\noffset package, do face daunting challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met the manager in an electronics manufacturing firm a\r\n\r\nfew  days ago.  He earns a salary of about $4,000, with three\r\n\r\nyoung  school-going  children, a  wife  who  is  not  working\r\n\r\nbecause she has to look after the two aged sickly parents  at\r\n\r\nhome.   They  live  in a condominium that they  bought  after\r\n\r\nselling their 5-room HDB flat some years ago.  They were very\r\n\r\nprudent last year.  They sold their family car.  They did not\r\n\r\nhave  this mindset that they have to continue having the car,\r\n\r\nthey   sold  the  car,  in  preparation  that  in  case   the\r\n\r\nbreadwinner  loses  his job, he does not  have  a  hefty  car\r\n\r\ninstalment  payment  to do.  They lost  money  on  that  car.\r\n\r\nStill, they find it tough.  Worse, for those who are in  this\r\n\r\nmiddle income group who are not unemployed.  They still  have\r\n\r\nbills  to  pay, income tax to pay, and they are  in  a  bind,\r\n\r\nhopefully they do not also have a credit card.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear many grouses from this middle income group and\r\n\r\nsome  of  them are not all that unreasonable.

It affects me as much  as  many  other\r\n\r\ntraders and investors who have suffered monetary loss because\r\n\r\nof  the  SGX  Settlement Committee's decision on  the  Links-Island.  It has been 2 years.  I have spoken to many industry\r\n\r\npractitioners and broking firms and they are also unhappy and\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  with  the SGX's decision  but  they  cannot  do\r\n\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been a remisier with OCBC when Links-Island\r\n\r\nwas  listed on the SGX and traded.  Subsequently, on  Friday,\r\n\r\n11th  August,  many other investors and I  bought  shares  of\r\n\r\nthis  company in the market.  On the next available  day,  on\r\n\r\nMonday,  14th  I contra-ed the 30 lots.  Some  of  the  other\r\n\r\ninvestors also contra-ed.  Two days later, on Wednesday,  the\r\n\r\nstock  was  suspended  by  the SGX  on  suspicion  of  market\r\n\r\nmanipulation.  It is very disappointing that the SGX took one\r\n\r\nfull year to conclude that the stock had been cornered.  What\r\n\r\nis  worse is SGX's decision to cancel the trades done in  the\r\n\r\nlast  three  trading  days before the suspension.   This  has\r\n\r\ncaused  abnormality in the stock, especially  for  those  who\r\n\r\nbought  the  shares a week before and contra-ed within  those\r\n\r\nthree  trading days.  Suddenly, by the arbitrary decision  of\r\n\r\nthe  SGX Committee, the buy positions on Friday became valid,\r\n\r\nwhereas  the  sell positions became invalid and cancelled  by\r\n\r\nthe Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Finance Minister explain how the SGX arrived at\r\n\r\nthis  arbitrary  decision?  How has the cancellation  of  the\r\n\r\ntrades  of  the last three days helped to solve the  cornered\r\n\r\nsituation?   It  has been almost two years.

And for those investors who suffered  loss\r\n\r\nbecause of the SGX's decision, what course of remedy is there\r\n\r\nfor them to claim this loss?

For  the  retrenched   bank\r\n\r\nemployees,  I think the same arrangements that  we  have  for\r\n\r\nindustry-specific training also will work out for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Mr Steve Chia's query on the Links-Island,\r\n\r\nthe  reason why SGX took two years to investigate is  because\r\n\r\nit  is  a  very complicated issue.  They have to examine  the\r\n\r\ntrades   of   more  than  50  parties  involved  during   the\r\n\r\ntransactions.   They have to investigate the significance  of\r\n\r\nthe  commercial  and personal relationship of  all  these  50\r\n\r\nparties.   They also have to investigate the cash  flows  and\r\n\r\nthe  trading  patterns of these individuals and  institutions\r\n\r\nwhich were trading in the Links-Island shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of their investigations, SGX has determined\r\n\r\nthat  Links shares were indeed cornered and I guess  what  Mr\r\n\r\nSteve Chia is referring to is the decision of SGX on how they\r\n\r\nshould settle the market trades during this period before the\r\n\r\nsuspension.  So SGX has decided that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  market trades during the period 14th to 16th August,  as\r\n\r\nhe  mentioned the three days, will be settled by cash instead\r\n\r\nof delivery of shares.  Now they have set the fair settlement\r\n\r\nprice  at  $1.21.  They have decided that this  is  the  most\r\n\r\nequitable solution without distinguishing whether the  trades\r\n\r\nwere done by investors with long or short positions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So having considered the circumstances of this case, the\r\n\r\nSettlements Committee has concluded that the weighted average\r\n\r\nof the Links shares during these three days would be the most\r\n\r\nequitable   and  the  most  appropriate  price.   They   have\r\n\r\nconsidered  other alternatives to this fair settlement  price\r\n\r\nbut  they decided against these alternatives because  it  was\r\n\r\nless equitable.  As to what investors can do, let me just say\r\n\r\nthat   the   Commercial  Affairs  Department   is   currently\r\n\r\ninvestigating  whether criminal offences  were  committed  in\r\n\r\nrelation to trading on Links shares and if the persons  under\r\n\r\ninvestigations are convicted, then these investors  in  Links\r\n\r\nshares  who traded with these persons will be able to  obtain\r\n\r\nlegal recourse.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Arthur Fong, do you like to withdraw\r\n\r\nthe amendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head M of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code MP 2100.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I have permission to take the three cuts\r\n\r\ntogether?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, please.

Therefore,  singles  with  no\r\n\r\nchildren  will  not qualify.  But divorcees and  widows  with\r\n\r\nchildren would qualify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, on the double child relief, the effective relief\r\n\r\nis $2,000 because you still enjoy the normal child relief and\r\n\r\nthat  really translates, even at the maximum of the  personal\r\n\r\nincome   tax,   to   about  $500  in  cash  benefits.    But,\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  the  Minister for  Finance  has  decided  that\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of  the double child relief should  not  be  done\r\n\r\nsuddenly and he has decided to phase this out over two years.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the double child relief would come down to  $3,000\r\n\r\nfrom the Year of Assessment 2003 from the current $4,000, and\r\n\r\nrevert to the normal child relief of $2,000 from the Year  of\r\n\r\nAssessment 2004.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the claims, I would like to tell Dr Ong Seh Hong that\r\n\r\nwe  have adjusted the amount of claim to $2,500 and based  on\r\n\r\nthe current claims, the average amount claimed per person  is\r\n\r\nonly  $1,600.

I note from the\r\n\r\nBudget estimates that the AGO has presented its workload  and\r\n\r\nperformance  indicators,  for example,  the  audit  cost  per\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars of auditable dollar, and also the  auditable\r\n\r\ndollar  per  audit staff.  My question is whether,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nthat  is  a credible measure, and what other measures  do  we\r\n\r\nhave,  and  how does the AGO compare with other  AGOs'  work.\r\n\r\nAnd, also, will the AGO take upon itself to audit expenses to\r\n\r\navoid   excesses  or  opulence  when  it  comes  to  building\r\n\r\nMinistries, as the fear or concern raised by Mr Tan Soo Khoon\r\n\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, as Mr Zainul Abidin has\r\n\r\npointed  out,  the  AGO's  efficiency  is  measured  by   two\r\n\r\nperformance  indicators which are based on a  proxy  for  its\r\n\r\naudit  workload, known as auditable dollar, which is a  total\r\n\r\nof the audited revenue expenditure, assets and liabilities of\r\n\r\nthe  auditees.  In other words, it looks at the  accounts  of\r\n\r\nthe  organisation  being audited, and it  adds  together  its\r\n\r\nrevenue,  expenditure, assets, liabilities,  its  profit  and\r\n\r\nloss,  as well as its balance sheet.  All added together,  it\r\n\r\nis  just a number, to give some indication of the size of the\r\n\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two performance indicators are the cost per\r\n\r\nauditable  dollar  as well as the amount of auditable  dollar\r\n\r\nper  unit staff.  The cost per auditable dollar measures  how\r\n\r\nefficiently  AGO  operates,  and  AGO  tries  to  keep  these\r\n\r\nindicators  as  low  as possible.  On  the  other  hand,  AGO\r\n\r\nstrives to maximise the amount of auditable dollars per  unit\r\n\r\nstaff,  as it is a measure of labour productivity.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nrough-and-ready measure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether AGO audits for opulence, the answer is no.\r\n\r\nIt is not his job to be a censor.  It is his job to make sure\r\n\r\nthat  if  you  have built the building, the  money  has  been\r\n\r\nproperly accounted for.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, the legal landscape in\r\n\r\nSingapore is going through significant changes.  The same  as\r\n\r\nthe  other  sectors  of industry, there is  a  need  for  the\r\n\r\nprofession  to restructure, or in the catchword of  the  day,\r\n\r\nremake itself to meet changing times.  It is therefore timely\r\n\r\nto  ask  the Minister to brief the House on the state of  the\r\n\r\nlegal system as well as on the plans to remake it.  There are\r\n\r\nobviously some concerns that I hope the Minister can address,\r\n\r\nand some suggestions that I hope he will consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concern is that there appears to be a large\r\n\r\nnumber of lawyers leaving the profession.  Would the Minister\r\n\r\nbe in a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposition to let the House know why this is the case?  It  is,\r\n\r\nof  course,  not  cheap to train lawyers.  If  lawyers  leave\r\n\r\npractice  after  a short period, it will seem  that  we  have\r\n\r\nwasted public money in training them in the first place.   It\r\n\r\nis  true  that  many  lawyers appear to have  been  extremely\r\n\r\nsuccessful in other professions, notably, I am happy to  say,\r\n\r\nin  the  creative  arts.   We have lawyers  who  have  become\r\n\r\ntheatrical directors, playwrights, actors, actresses and even\r\n\r\ndancers.   Many  lawyers are now employed also in  managerial\r\n\r\nand  other  positions  in companies.   But,  of  course,  the\r\n\r\nconcern  is  whether  there are enough lawyers  in  practice.\r\n\r\nThere are currently, I understand from the Law Society,  only\r\n\r\n3,200 lawyers taking out practising certificates.  Given  the\r\n\r\ngrowing  economy,  are they enough to service  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nbeyond?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the training of lawyers is a matter of\r\n\r\nconcern.  There is a move away from traditional practice such\r\n\r\nas  conveyancing  into legal areas more attuned  to  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy,  such  as intellectual property law,  computer  law,\r\n\r\nbiotechnology  law.   How  is  the  Ministry  assisting   and\r\n\r\nfacilitating the training of lawyers to meet this  challenge?\r\n\r\nIn  particular,  will  there be a need to  impose  compulsory\r\n\r\ncourses  for practising lawyers, in the same way  as  doctors\r\n\r\nare  expected  too,  to upgrade their skills  and  knowledge?\r\n\r\nThis  is  also  currently  the practice  of  many  countries,\r\n\r\nincluding England, where there is a felt need to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  legal profession is kept up to date with the development\r\n\r\nof laws, especially in relation to those new areas.  There is\r\n\r\nalso  a felt need to train our lawyers, who are mostly  tuned\r\n\r\nto  litigation,  to  improve  on  their  alternative  dispute\r\n\r\nresolution  skills, such as arbitration and mediation.   What\r\n\r\nis being done to improve that?  Indeed, given the practice of\r\n\r\nlaw  now requires individuals who are not just good in  legal\r\n\r\nanalysis, but also in other disciplines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister, for example, have a view on whether\r\n\r\nwe  should have law as a post-graduate discipline, as is  the\r\n\r\ncase  in  the  United States, rather than as an undergraduate\r\n\r\ndiscipline?  Take a very simple example on this type of need.\r\n\r\nIf a lawyer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactually wants to be a patent attorney, he would need to have\r\n\r\na  good  grounding  in  science as well  as  in  engineering.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  we  can see the need for non-legal  training  and\r\n\r\nmany  other  areas,  such as economics, statistics,  computer\r\n\r\nscience  or  life  sciences.  Given that this  is  the  case,\r\n\r\nshould  we  not  then look to either making law  as  a  post-graduate degree, or having double degree programmes,  started\r\n\r\nin our universities?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I wish to raise the issue of whether the influx\r\n\r\nof  foreign lawyers into Singapore has achieved the result of\r\n\r\ntransferring of technical know-how to our local lawyers.  The\r\n\r\nLegal Profession Act was amended to allow local firms to have\r\n\r\njoint ventures with foreign firms, so that there can be  such\r\n\r\na  transfer.  Can the Minister give us an update on the joint\r\n\r\nlaw ventures with foreign firms?  Recently, we have seen some\r\n\r\nlocal firms parting company with their foreign partners.  The\r\n\r\ndivorce rate, given the numbers, seems to be quite high.  Why\r\n\r\nare  the relationships so short-lived?  Can the scheme really\r\n\r\nbe  regarded  as a success in so far as it is  unlikely  that\r\n\r\nmuch  transfer of expertise could have been done in this very\r\n\r\nshort period?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, developing Singapore as an arbitration hub.\r\n\r\nOne  of  the  most  useful fiscal measures announced  in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  Budget is that of the withholding tax exemption  for\r\n\r\narbitrators.   International  arbitrators  were  subject   to\r\n\r\nwithholding  tax  at the prevailing non-resident  income  tax\r\n\r\nrate   of  24.5%.   To  promote  this  arbitration  industry,\r\n\r\npayments to international arbitrators have been exempted from\r\n\r\nwithholding tax, with immediate effect.  This is no doubt  an\r\n\r\nimportant  step  as it will immediately reduce  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ninternational arbitration in Singapore.  Personally,  I  have\r\n\r\nheard  from  two  well-known  international  arbitrators  who\r\n\r\noriginally  lamented that they were unhappy about  having  to\r\n\r\npay  this  tax,  that they would be much more  interested  in\r\n\r\nworking in Singapore if they were exempted from such  a  tax.\r\n\r\nSo I think this is actually a very good sign.  Their wish has\r\n\r\nnow been granted.  But I believe that it would be unlikely to\r\n\r\nresult in an immediate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  the international arbitration  situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us put the arbitration scene in perspective. For\r\n\r\nexample,  the American Arbitration Association and the  China\r\n\r\nInternational Commercial Dispute Resolution Centre, each  did\r\n\r\nover  500  arbitration cases in the year  2000.   Singapore's\r\n\r\nInternational  Arbitration Centre, on the other  hand,  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  very  much less, about 100 cases a year.  So  the  task\r\n\r\nwould  be  a very enormous one, and I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister how his Ministry, perhaps working together with  the\r\n\r\nother relevant agencies, could put Singapore on the map as an\r\n\r\ninternational arbitration centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest for one thing that, given the fact that\r\n\r\nSingapore  companies are branching out into  the  region  and\r\n\r\nbeyond  and  doing  business  globally,  would  the  Ministry\r\n\r\npersuade  and advocate that such companies do their  best  to\r\n\r\npromote  the  use  of Singapore law as the governing  law  of\r\n\r\ntransaction,  so  that arbitration can then be  conducted  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?    Additionally,  may  I  ask  whether  additional\r\n\r\nfacilities  are planned to enhance the quality of arbitration\r\n\r\npremises in Singapore.  Because usually arbitration cases  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  done  in hotels, and  there  have  been  some\r\n\r\nreservations about the suitability of some of our hotels  for\r\n\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, and perhaps more importantly, are we, first of\r\n\r\nall,   training   enough   arbitrators   with   international\r\n\r\npotential; also, training support staff necessary to  have  a\r\n\r\nfirst-class  arbitration service?  For  example,  in  a  good\r\n\r\ninternational arbitration, what is needed is that there  will\r\n\r\nbe  professional reporters who can record verbatim reports of\r\n\r\nthe  arbitration proceedings.  Very often, such professionals\r\n\r\nare  not  available  in  Singapore and  frequently  costs  of\r\n\r\narbitration are increased because such personnel have  to  be\r\n\r\nflown in from places such as Australia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister can give some answers to these\r\n\r\nvarious concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nask the Minister about the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncurrent  policy  with  regard to the quota  of  law  students\r\n\r\nallowed  to  practise  in Singapore, and  that  includes  the\r\n\r\nnumbers admitted to NUS as well as the restrictions on  those\r\n\r\ncoming  in from foreign universities.  I ask this because  in\r\n\r\n1993  there were amendments to the Legal Profession Act where\r\n\r\nwe restricted the numbers of lawyers allowed to practise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the reasons for that were two-fold.\r\n\r\nOne, it was to regulate the quality of the lawyers allowed to\r\n\r\npractise, a reason with which I agree fully.  The second  was\r\n\r\nthe  allocation of manpower, because the concern was that too\r\n\r\nmany  people  might go into law, resulting in the  detraction\r\n\r\nfrom  the other areas of the economy.  On the second  reason,\r\n\r\nwhat  we have seen from the impact of the amendments in 1993,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  felt  in  1997, was a fairly sharp  reduction  of\r\n\r\nlawyers available for practice in the market.  That seems  to\r\n\r\nhave  the effect of actually driving up the starting salaries\r\n\r\nof  lawyers  because there were fewer good talents available.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  we  did  not at that time take  into  account  the\r\n\r\nphenomenon  that we saw after 1997, which was the  increasing\r\n\r\nnumbers of lawyers leaving practice.\r\n\r\nWithout  meaning  to take away from the Minister's  right  to\r\n\r\nreply  to Prof. Chin Tet Yung, I can actually enumerate  some\r\n\r\nof  the  reasons why the lawyers have been leaving  practice.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  there  are  those who leave  for  personal  reasons\r\n\r\nbecause  they have decided that law is not their thing.   The\r\n\r\nsecond  group are those who have decided that practice  is  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  too  stressful, but they  would  still  like  to\r\n\r\nmaintain contact with the law and therefore go and become in-house counsel or some other law-related practice which is not\r\n\r\nactually  professional practice.  The third group  are  those\r\n\r\nwho  join  foreign law firms and therefore  do  not  practise\r\n\r\nSingapore  law but practise offshore law, either in Singapore\r\n\r\nor overseas.  So the policy on the restriction of the numbers\r\n\r\nappears  not to take into account this leakage.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister  could comment on that.  Also in commenting  on  the\r\n\r\nnumbers  of lawyers admitted to practice, would the  Minister\r\n\r\nalso let us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow  whether  the  Ministry  has  taken  into  account   the\r\n\r\nincreased demand, or potential demand, bearing in mind,  that\r\n\r\nnow  there  is  actually a greater demand for  what  we  call\r\n\r\nprofessional  support lawyers (PSLs).  These are  the  people\r\n\r\nwho  do  research,  for example, or carry out  administrative\r\n\r\nfunctions.   They are qualified lawyers and their background,\r\n\r\nas lawyers, is helpful but they do not actually practise law.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the fact that we wish to develop Singapore as\r\n\r\nan  arbitration  hub means that we need the  back-up  support\r\n\r\nfrom lawyers as well.  And thirdly, the fact that we wish  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  Singapore  as  an IT hub  again  is  going  to  need\r\n\r\nlawyers.   So  I  would  be grateful if  the  Minister  would\r\n\r\ncomment on the quota of lawyers available for that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, one of the major\r\n\r\nconcerns  has  been  the costs involved in  taking  cases  to\r\n\r\ncourt.   Lawyers have never been cheap, but also they  remain\r\n\r\nnot  cheap these days.  Some of the lawyers in this House may\r\n\r\nbe able to confirm this trend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither are costs involved in bringing cases to the\r\n\r\ncourts.   Indeed,  many  Members  of  this  House  must  have\r\n\r\nreceived feedback from residents saying how expensive  it  is\r\n\r\nto  bring private action suits, enforce your rights,  and  so\r\n\r\non.   Singapore has an enviable reputation no doubt  for  its\r\n\r\nefficient courts and its pro-business approach.  But all  the\r\n\r\nkudos received from businessmen, and the like, would not make\r\n\r\nour  legal  system  a great one if the common  man  or  woman\r\n\r\ncannot  have  reasonable cause to use  the  legal  system  to\r\n\r\nresolve disputes and enforce his rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, Sir, I would like to suggest that we look\r\n\r\ninto  how we can bring justice to the heartlands as it  were.\r\n\r\nWe already have community mediation centres set up in various\r\n\r\nparts  of  Singapore.  Can we not have a circuit of mediation\r\n\r\ncentres  or  small claims courts for settling  minor  claims,\r\n\r\nthat is, claims not over $10,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperhaps,  where  the  costs  of  hiring  lawyers  or   filing\r\n\r\ndocuments would not be too prohibitive?  In fact, such courts\r\n\r\nmay  take the stance that they should not have lawyers at all\r\n\r\nin  such  cases.  I should also like to suggest that  we  can\r\n\r\ninvolve   more  members  of  the  community  in  the  dispute\r\n\r\nresolution  process.  Right now, some community  leaders  are\r\n\r\nalready trained in mediating neighbour disputes.  It  may  be\r\n\r\nappropriate  to  increase  their role  to  include  mediating\r\n\r\nbetween,  for  example,  traders  and  consumers.   I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether that would be something we can see in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore can, of course, be very proud of its\r\n\r\nlegal system.  Our lawyers are well trained and this has,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  been  the envy of many.  But the quest for  justice,\r\n\r\nespecially for the common man, is not an easy one and  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  cheap one.  It is very important therefore to have  a\r\n\r\nlegal  system that is affordable.  At the end of the day,  if\r\n\r\nthe  man-in-the-street  agrees  that  our  legal  system  can\r\n\r\ndispense justice fairly quickly and at reasonable cost,  that\r\n\r\nshould perhaps be the most sought after kudos that one  would\r\n\r\nwant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, I thank\r\n\r\nthe  two  Members  who have spoken.  I notice  that  quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of serious items are proposed to be raised under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Law, but the time allotted is very limited.   So\r\n\r\nto  enable as many of the topics to be raised, I will  be  as\r\n\r\nbrief  as possible to enable answers to be given on the other\r\n\r\ncuts  that  are  forthcoming.  And I  apologise  if,  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess of being brief, I do not give complete answers and if\r\n\r\na  serious  point has not been answered, I hope Members  will\r\n\r\nraise it under Questions for Oral Answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take first the different aspects related to the\r\n\r\nlegal   profession  on  law.   First,  lawyers  leaving   the\r\n\r\nprofession.  What Prof. Chin and Ms Indranee Rajah said in  a\r\n\r\nsense  are  related to matters of the same issue.  Are  there\r\n\r\ntoo  few  lawyers today?  Why are they leaving?  Is  there  a\r\n\r\nneed to worry?  What must be done?  This is partly caused  by\r\n\r\nthe  publicity about lawyers leaving the private  sector.   I\r\n\r\nthink that, like any other job, people leave the legal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofession for various reasons.  And since Ms Indranee  Rajah\r\n\r\nhas  listed some of them, I will not repeat them.  But  there\r\n\r\nare  many  reasons.   And  I  do  not  want  to  add  to  the\r\n\r\nspeculation whether it is the stress of the work, and so  on.\r\n\r\nBut  I do want to say that the legal profession is in a state\r\n\r\nof  flux  because of the many changes that have  taken  place\r\n\r\nwithin  the  global  environment  and,  indeed,  within   our\r\n\r\neconomy.   The profession has experienced a wide  variety  of\r\n\r\nchanges  and changing expectations of how the legal  services\r\n\r\nwill develop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to some extent, I am not surprised that quite a\r\n\r\nnumber of lawyers are leaving the profession in recent years.\r\n\r\nI  think  things would settle down after we have gone through\r\n\r\nthe  period  of  redistribution  of  legal  talent  following\r\n\r\nespecially  the  abolition  of the conveyancing  scale  fees.\r\n\r\nShould we be concerned?  What should we do?  The first  thing\r\n\r\nwe  should  do  is  to  have a better  understanding  of  the\r\n\r\nunderlying  reasons  why  lawyers  are  leaving  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.  And this is one of the main reasons why the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Law  is conducting a very comprehensive survey,  together\r\n\r\nwith  the  Department of Statistics, on  the  legal  services\r\n\r\nindustry and the profession.  The response to the census,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  has  been  very  good.  Some  99%  of  the  law  firms\r\n\r\nresponded and 75% of individual lawyers have responded.   The\r\n\r\ninformation  is being collated and, I think,  for  the  first\r\n\r\ntime,  we  have an in-depth study of the nature of the  legal\r\n\r\nindustry and the profession.  Hopefully, we will then be able\r\n\r\nto  chart  the various directions and steps that need  to  be\r\n\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the quota of law students, Ms Indranee Rajah was\r\n\r\nright about the rationale for these steps we have taken.  The\r\n\r\nemphasis  is really more on quality than on the numbers.   In\r\n\r\nthis  regard,  the  Second Committee's Report  on  Supply  of\r\n\r\nLawyers, made only last year, made recommendations on how  we\r\n\r\ncan bring a wider variety of talents into the profession, and\r\n\r\nthese  include admitting of law students from Australia,  New\r\n\r\nZealand, giving the Board of Legal Education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility in approving combined and double  degree\r\n\r\ncourses  and  in admitting, on a case-by-case basis,  quality\r\n\r\ngraduates who do not meet the normal criteria.  I should,  in\r\n\r\nresponse  to  the point that she made, assure  her  that  the\r\n\r\nCommittee,  when  adjusting the NUS intake  numbers,  did  so\r\n\r\ntaking  into account the higher attrition rates in the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession.   This  is  one of the  factors  they  took  into\r\n\r\naccount.  But here, again, I would say that it would  take  a\r\n\r\nfew years before the effects on the recommendations are felt.\r\n\r\nIn  the  meantime, we may experience two or  three  years  of\r\n\r\nnegative growth in the number of lawyers.  But I do not think\r\n\r\nthere is reason to be overly alarmed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentioned the need for us to take into consideration\r\n\r\nlawyers  who would be in supportive role, other than  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  practice  of  law.   I  do  not  think  there  is  a\r\n\r\nrestriction  on that.  For example, the restriction  we  have\r\n\r\nfrom one of the scheduled universities, having a second class\r\n\r\nupper degree, is a restriction on practice of law.  But there\r\n\r\nis no restriction for non-practitioner roles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the end of the day, let me repeat what I have\r\n\r\nsaid  before on numerous occasions in this House, that  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  view these figures as being cast in stone, that when  we\r\n\r\nhave  these  reviews and adjustments, we must be prepared  to\r\n\r\nadjust to changing circumstances.  And if there is a need for\r\n\r\nus  to  make adjustments earlier than expected, for  example,\r\n\r\nafter  we  have  studied  the  comprehensive  report  that  I\r\n\r\nreferred  to, we should be prepared, and I would be prepared,\r\n\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for training of lawyers, a point raised by Prof. Chin\r\n\r\nTet  Yung,  the Law Faculty, the Law Society, the Academy  of\r\n\r\nLaw,  to  name a few organisations, do conduct a wide variety\r\n\r\nof  courses for training of law amongst our legal profession.\r\n\r\nThere are all sorts of seminars and workshops, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question whether continuing legal education\r\n\r\nshould  be  made compulsory, I am of the view that  the  lead\r\n\r\nshould  not  come  from  the  Government.   It  must  be  the\r\n\r\nprofession itself that realises that it is in the interest of\r\n\r\nthe profession to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe abreast of fast changing developments in Singapore, in the\r\n\r\nregion,  in  the  world, both in law and  other  disciplines,\r\n\r\nwhich have an impact on law.  So it is in the interest of the\r\n\r\nprofession  to  provide for continuing  legal  education  and\r\n\r\nwhether they would like this continuing legal education to be\r\n\r\nmade  optional, or compulsory.  I would first  want  them  to\r\n\r\nstudy the matter and take an initiative.  If, after they have\r\n\r\nstudied it, they feel that amendments to the Legal Profession\r\n\r\nAct  ought to be made, I would be prepared to entertain  this\r\n\r\nrequest.  But I would rather that this approach be taken than\r\n\r\na  Government  decree  in  the first  place  that  the  Legal\r\n\r\nProfession  Act should be amended to make it compulsory.   In\r\n\r\nthis  regard,  we would be prepared to have discussions  with\r\n\r\nthe Law Society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for post-graduate degrees, we have discussed this\r\n\r\nlast  year,  and  I  would like to point  out  that  the  key\r\n\r\nconsiderations are to take into account scarce resources, the\r\n\r\nneed  to  prevent legal education from becoming prohibitively\r\n\r\nexpensive.   Having said that, I am aware that  the  NUS  Law\r\n\r\nFaculty is encouraging more graduates to take law as a second\r\n\r\ndegree.   It is also moving towards allowing law to be  taken\r\n\r\nas  part of a multi-disciplinary degree.  And in this regard,\r\n\r\nthey  are also considering the possibility of law as a double\r\n\r\ndegree.  I do not know when they will take the decision.  But\r\n\r\nI  think  this is moving along the direction that Prof.  Chin\r\n\r\nmentioned, and these are good moves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Prof. Chin talked about the joint law venture (JLV)\r\n\r\nscheme.  He asked for an update, whether it was a success and\r\n\r\nwhy  the  joint law venture was so short-lived.   To  quickly\r\n\r\nrecap,  the objective of the joint law venture scheme  is  to\r\n\r\nensure that there is a sufficient top-tier legal expertise in\r\n\r\nSingapore to service our growing financial sector.   The  JLV\r\n\r\nscheme  serves to achieve this by attracting more top foreign\r\n\r\nlegal  talent  to  Singapore and providing opportunities  for\r\n\r\nSingapore lawyers to be trained with the leading law firms of\r\n\r\nthe world and, thereby, facilitate transfer of top-tier legal\r\n\r\nexpertise  to local firms.  In terms of training of Singapore\r\n\r\nlawyers, most of the JLVs have indeed put in place\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomprehensive training programmes for Singapore lawyers.  And\r\n\r\nI  think  benefits  of this objective of training  are  quite\r\n\r\nclear.  In terms of transfer of legal expertise, because this\r\n\r\nis in existence for just a period of 20 months, there are not\r\n\r\nreally enough opportunities for this to take place in a  very\r\n\r\nsignificant way.  To compound matters, the uncertain economic\r\n\r\noutlook in the region has also made it difficult.  But  as  a\r\n\r\npartner from a top UK law firm recently quoted in Legal Week,\r\n\r\nhe  said,  \"it started a bit slowly because of the  downturn,\r\n\r\nbut  now  the  benefits are coming through and we  are  happy\r\n\r\nabout it.\"   We should be better able to assess the situation\r\n\r\nafter  the  economic  outlook of the region  picks  up.   But\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  the local law firms have been able  to  obtain\r\n\r\nconsiderable intangible benefits from the JLVs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked why are these relationships short-lived?\r\n\r\nAgain,  let us remember the JLV system has been in  operation\r\n\r\nfor  about only 20 months.  It is therefore too early, in  my\r\n\r\nview, to arrive at any final judgement on the scheme.  Out of\r\n\r\nthe  eight JLVs, only one has been dissolved.  So, that  does\r\n\r\nnot  tell us enough to arrive at a conclusion on the  success\r\n\r\nor failure of the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Chin talked about access to the justice\r\n\r\nsystem.   I  think we cannot disagree with him that  we  must\r\n\r\nalways  ensure that there is access to the legal  system  for\r\n\r\nthe common men.  But our position here is not as bad as Prof.\r\n\r\nChin  would  make it out to be.  For those who really  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  legal  fees  at  all, there are  various  avenues  of\r\n\r\nassistance which are available, including legal aid and  free\r\n\r\nlegal  advice at various legal clinics.  The Legal Aid Bureau\r\n\r\nrevised the means test quite recently and more people,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult,  qualify.  There has been some 15%  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber of cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that when we talk about cost of legal\r\n\r\nproceedings,  there are really two components.  Firstly,  are\r\n\r\nthe  court fees, which include stamp fees paid for filing  of\r\n\r\ncourt documents and so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non, and hearing fees.  Secondly, the fees charged by lawyers.\r\n\r\nAs  far as the costs by courts are concerned, the courts have\r\n\r\ntaken  efforts to keep court fees low.  Stamp fees  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  increased  since  1991,  and  hearing  fees  have   not\r\n\r\nincreased  since 1993.  So, there have been efforts  to  keep\r\n\r\nthem low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for lawyers' fees, like all professional services,\r\n\r\nlawyers'  fees are determined largely by market forces.   Are\r\n\r\nthey  too  high or too low?  Prof. Chin says the lawyers  are\r\n\r\nnot  cheap.   How  do  they  compare  with  other  countries?\r\n\r\nAccording  to  Asia-Pacific  Legal  500,  \"Singapore's  legal\r\n\r\nmarket  is  extremely competitive.  Fees remain at relatively\r\n\r\nlow levels, particularly among Singaporean clients who, as  a\r\n\r\nresult,  receive some of the best value legal advice  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.\"    Compared  to  their  international   counterparts,\r\n\r\nSingapore  lawyers  are cheap.  But that  does  not  mean  we\r\n\r\nshould not strive to reduce legal costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, let me also say that the justice system\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean  only  the courts.  We must  also  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  alternative dispute resolution methods.  He referred\r\n\r\nto  the mediation centres and the Small Claims courts.  Since\r\n\r\nthere  are two MPs who are moving cuts on mediation later,  I\r\n\r\nwill  leave  it  to  my colleague, Senior Minister  of  State\r\n\r\nAssoc.  Prof.  Ho Peng Kee, to deal with that shortly.   But,\r\n\r\noverall,  I do not think the cost situation in Singapore  has\r\n\r\nposed such onerous obstacles.  Our court fees have been  kept\r\n\r\nlow,  our lawyers' fees are competitive internationally  and,\r\n\r\nfor  those who cannot afford, there are various alternatives.\r\n\r\nBut we should seek constantly to see how we can improve it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on his point about arbitration, I welcome his\r\n\r\ncomments  about the recent Ministry of Finance's  removal  of\r\n\r\nthe  tax.   I agree with him when he says we should  position\r\n\r\nourselves in Singapore as an arbitration hub.  It is a matter\r\n\r\non  which  I  myself have spoken.  I think we  have  all  the\r\n\r\nassets   and  advantages  to  do  that.   We  have  excellent\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, a good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegal  system,  our  reputation is sound internationally,  we\r\n\r\nhave  common law and English-speaking lawyers.  He  mentioned\r\n\r\nChina.  I think we are one of the few places where there  are\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking  lawyers who are familiar with  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage and traditions.  So we have all these going for  us.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  harness these strengths and position ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe  removal of the tax for international arbitrators is  but\r\n\r\none step.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, much more must be done. He has enumerated\r\n\r\nmany   points  to  be  taken  into  consideration.   We  will\r\n\r\nconsider, and I will ask those who are following up  on  this\r\n\r\nto  take into account Prof. Chin's ideas.  Working with other\r\n\r\nagencies?  Indeed  we  do  so.  We work  with  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nInternational Arbitration Centre, Singapore Academy  of  Law,\r\n\r\nthe  Law  Society and various other agencies in our  plan  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  Singapore as an international arbitration  hub.   If\r\n\r\nProf. Chin wants to be involved in this exercise, we will  be\r\n\r\nhappy to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Legal Services Working Group,\r\n\r\nchaired  by  Solicitor-General Mr Chan Seng  Onn  and  Senior\r\n\r\nCounsel Mr Shanmugam, will be making recommendations  on  how\r\n\r\nSingapore can be further developed as an alternative  dispute\r\n\r\nresolution  hub  in  this  region,  and  I  understand  these\r\n\r\nrecommendations will be examined carefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several other points here, but I should allow\r\n\r\nother topics to be raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Sir, Singapore is a small country and\r\n\r\nour  people live and work close to one another.  With  better\r\n\r\neducation, our citizens are becoming more conscious of  their\r\n\r\nindividual   rights.   At  the  same  time,  with   increased\r\n\r\ncompetition and volatility in the economic landscape,  stress\r\n\r\nin society grows.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sets the stage for an increased likelihood of\r\n\r\nfriction in many different areas.  For example, at our  meet-the-people sessions, it is not uncommon for us to come across\r\n\r\nsome  long-drawn  disputes between parties.  These  disputes,\r\n\r\nthough  not  very complex, tend to drag on and they  drag  in\r\n\r\nother bodies, such as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvarious  Government  agencies, and then  they  go  round  and\r\n\r\nround.   There is great effort expended on the  part  of  all\r\n\r\nsides, but not always for commensurate benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporean society not to become overly litigious\r\n\r\nin this new setting, mediation seems to be a good alternative\r\n\r\nto  be  used.   I would like to ask the Minister whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment or his Ministry will be taking additional measures\r\n\r\nto increase the use of mediation in dispute resolution at the\r\n\r\ncommunity  level,  and  will the Government  consider  making\r\n\r\nmediation  mandatory, at least for certain types of  disputes\r\n\r\nbetween   individuals  on  the  recommendation   of   certain\r\n\r\nauthorised persons and, if so, what steps will the Government\r\n\r\nbe  taking  to  develop  the manpower needed  to  staff  such\r\n\r\nmediation infrastructure?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, along the same vein as what my\r\n\r\ncolleague, Mr Heng Chee How, has just spoken about,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to touch on another perspective with regard to the need\r\n\r\nfor mediation centres to be set up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than tensions or conflicts arising among\r\n\r\nneighbours,  one increasingly common phenomenon  is  actually\r\n\r\nthe area pertaining to conflict mediation that has to do with\r\n\r\nschool-going  teenagers.   The  police  and  other  community\r\n\r\nagencies  have very wisely recognised this and have organised\r\n\r\nstreet  soccer and other games to ensure that kids  are  kept\r\n\r\naway  from  unwholesome  activities,  especially  during  the\r\n\r\nschool  holidays.  However, my concern is that while  playing\r\n\r\nthese games, kids do get involved in scuffles and fights over\r\n\r\nthe game itself.  Since youths are more disposed to outbursts\r\n\r\nand,  if  tensions  built up are not released  earlier,  they\r\n\r\nactually  can  get very explosive.  This, to my  mind,  is  a\r\n\r\ncause for concern for a community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I would like to urge our grassroots and\r\n\r\nyouth  leaders to play a more active role in helping to  deal\r\n\r\nwith these problems.  But, as things stand at the moment, not\r\n\r\nall  our  grassroots and youth leaders are properly  equipped\r\n\r\nwith the skills to handle these sensitive issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister consider setting aside more money for\r\n\r\nthe  community and social sector development agency or  other\r\n\r\nagencies  within  the  ambit of the  Ministry  to  help  fund\r\n\r\ncourses  to  train  our  grassroots and  youth  leaders  with\r\n\r\nawareness  and  skills  programmes?  Can  the  Minister  also\r\n\r\nconsider  some  publicity  promotion  of  existing  mediation\r\n\r\ncentres?  Lastly, can the Minister review how we can  educate\r\n\r\nand encourage the ordinary citizens to seek the assistance of\r\n\r\nsuch centres?  All these will work towards fostering a spirit\r\n\r\nof harmony and neighbourliness in our housing estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to propose three\r\n\r\nareas  to promote enterprise.  First of all, bankruptcy laws.\r\n\r\nI  would like to suggest that the Ministry look at trying  to\r\n\r\ndifferentiate   between  bankruptcies  caused   by   business\r\n\r\nfailures, especially start-ups, versus bankruptcies caused by\r\n\r\nfraudulent or criminal cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, people who fail in attempting to start companies\r\n\r\nand  attempting to be entrepreneurs.  If we take them out  of\r\n\r\nthe  system,  it  will be a big loss, because  they  are  the\r\n\r\npeople who can come back and do a lot more in trying to start\r\n\r\nup more successful companies later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on self-destruct laws, I support the call made\r\n\r\nby Mr Raymond Lim to put in place laws which self-destruct or\r\n\r\nhave sunset clauses in them, for obvious reasons that they do\r\n\r\nnot  get  outdated and do not become a hindrance  over  time,\r\n\r\nespecially for businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, on the legal system for the new economy, while we\r\n\r\nare advancing in technology and in many other areas, I do not\r\n\r\nthink our legal system is able to keep up, especially in  the\r\n\r\narea  of  intellectual property, cross-border laws,  etc.   I\r\n\r\nsuggest that we try to benchmark other countries and  try  to\r\n\r\nlearn  the things that have been done by others and implement\r\n\r\nsuch  things  as  quickly as possible into  Singapore.   But,\r\n\r\nuntil  we  can do that, there will be issues which  we  still\r\n\r\ncannot resolve, and I would like to suggest that we implement\r\n\r\na  system  of  visiting judges, where we invite  judges  from\r\n\r\ncountries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  prior experience in the areas which we need and do  not\r\n\r\nhave  right now.  We can invite such judges from time to time\r\n\r\nto arbitrate on issues and resolve issues, and this will give\r\n\r\nconfidence  for investors to actually do more complex  things\r\n\r\nand technology type of activities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wang Kai Yuen is not here.

Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the Singapore\r\n\r\nLand  Authority  is the biggest owner of land  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTwo  years ago, I made a call in this House for the then Land\r\n\r\nOffice to be pro-active in putting up land for public use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that Singapore Land Authority can be more\r\n\r\npro-active  in  putting  up  vacant  land  for  public   use.\r\n\r\nRecently,  in a dialogue session with my grassroots  leaders,\r\n\r\nit   came   across  very  clearly  that  whenever  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  want to make use of State land, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nLand  Authority usually requests a high rental or they  claim\r\n\r\nthat land is needed for other purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Singapore Land Authority to\r\n\r\nseriously consider how they can open up State land for public\r\n\r\nuse,  particularly in the area of sports and  recreation.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  pressure comes from  the  Auditor-General's\r\n\r\nOffice, which demands that State land be rented out at market\r\n\r\nprices  wherever  possible.  But my call is  that  we  should\r\n\r\nrelease  such  State land, particularly those which  are  not\r\n\r\nrequired immediately within the next three years, to  be  let\r\n\r\nout  for public use so that we can encourage greater use  for\r\n\r\nsports and recreation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second point relates to zoning in Singapore.\r\n\r\nMany of the State land are usually either zoned as commercial\r\n\r\nor residential usage.  I would like to make a call whether it\r\n\r\nis  possible to create some new category called critical  and\r\n\r\nessential  services  such as sports  and  electricity  plants\r\n\r\nwhere we do not charge the full market value so that many  of\r\n\r\nour leading corporations, eg, PSA and Changi Airport,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  compete with other big players in the world which  enjoy\r\n\r\ncheap  land  and  other special grants from their  respective\r\n\r\ngovernments.   I would like the Singapore Land  Authority  to\r\n\r\nconsider this request seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Sir, I would like to support my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Mr  Ravindran, in calling for a  more  pro-active\r\n\r\nuse,  at  least  temporary  use, of  vacant  State  land  for\r\n\r\ncommunity purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are pockets of vacant State land in most\r\n\r\nconstituencies in Singapore and some of these pockets may  be\r\n\r\nactually left vacant for fairly extended periods.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to join the call for the SLA  to  consider  a\r\n\r\npolicy of more actively and easily allowing community use  of\r\n\r\nsuch lands.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, some of my\r\n\r\npoints  have  already been raised by my colleagues  who  have\r\n\r\nspoken before me and I shall not repeat them.  I, too,  would\r\n\r\nlike to call upon the Singapore Land Authority to be more pro-active  in  allowing  vacant land to be  used  by  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations and other non-profit organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the Singapore Land Authority also\r\n\r\noffers   rebates   on  charges  and  levies  for   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  and non-profit organisations.  In  land-scarce\r\n\r\nSingapore,   this   is  indeed  a  welcome  development   for\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations and the community.  It should  also\r\n\r\nbe  good  news for the SLA as it can now save on  maintenance\r\n\r\ncosts while the land is put to good use until it is time  for\r\n\r\nredevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for many grassroots organisations which will\r\n\r\nhave to incur costs in converting the land for community  use\r\n\r\nand  maintaining  it, the rebates may not be  sufficient.   I\r\n\r\nwould,  therefore,  like  to urge  the  Ministry  of  Law  to\r\n\r\nconsider increasing the rebate or levying just a nominal rate\r\n\r\nfor  recognised grassroots organisations that use State  land\r\n\r\nfor   non-profit  activities  that  are  beneficial  to   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, I thank the Members for sharing their\r\n\r\nconcerns on Ministry of Law matters.  First, let me take  the\r\n\r\ncuts on community mediation by Mr Heng and Mdm Ho.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those of you who were in the House four years ago\r\n\r\nwould  have  sat together with me as we passed the  Community\r\n\r\nMediation   Bill.   That  was  a  landmark  move,  signalling\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intention to promote community mediation  as  a\r\n\r\nmeans of settling community disputes.  All of us who know the\r\n\r\nground  will  know  that  there  are  some  of  these   minor\r\n\r\nrelational   disputes  between  family  members,  neighbours,\r\n\r\nstallholders,  which  lend  themselves  more  to   settlement\r\n\r\nthrough  mediation  rather  than litigation.   Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nsome  of  these cases end up in court.  That is no  good  for\r\n\r\ncommunity  bonding and social cohesion, a point that  Mdm  Ho\r\n\r\nhas talked about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, four years on, Sir, I am pleased to say that we\r\n\r\nhave made good progress in this area.  In other words, we are\r\n\r\non  track.  Just some statistics to cheer us up.  But  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  just the statistics, for those of us who know the ground\r\n\r\nwill  agree, we are cheered more by actual cases that we have\r\n\r\ncome across where people, through mediation, have had some of\r\n\r\ntheir disputes settled amicably.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over these 3-4 years, our CMC has facilitated some 800\r\n\r\nmediation cases.  We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  set  up  three CMCs.  Sir, more cases are  increasingly\r\n\r\nbeing  handled, starting from 120 in 1998 to 211 in 1999  and\r\n\r\nlast  year,  273.   Of course, we are not just  wanting  more\r\n\r\ncases  to surface.  For we all know that there are cases  out\r\n\r\nthere  which  really should be mediated, and  these  are  the\r\n\r\ncases  we  want to encourage to be so mediated. Mediation  is\r\n\r\nindeed  the  way  to  go  to settle  these  minor  relational\r\n\r\ndisputes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we are cheered, what more can be done? I think\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  point that the two Members have talked  about.\r\n\r\nThis  is  sort of a wish list which answers Prof. Chin's  and\r\n\r\nMdm  Ho's  concerns.  The first is that we  will  proliferate\r\n\r\nmediation  venues  on  the ground.  Besides  having  flagship\r\n\r\nmediation  centres,  which  should  be  spearheaded  by   the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development  Councils, which  we  hope  will  take\r\n\r\nownership  of the process because, after all, it is  also  in\r\n\r\nline with their aims to promote community bonding, we hope to\r\n\r\ndesignate  two  or three satellite mediation  venues  on  the\r\n\r\nground  in  each District, working in concert with the  CDCs.\r\n\r\nIn  this way, mediation services will be made more accessible\r\n\r\nto   Singaporeans.   Hence,  we  have  started  with   having\r\n\r\nmediation venues now in Community Centres in Ang Mo  Kio  and\r\n\r\nalso in Eunos.  We will do more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mdm Ho has talked about training of more\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders and volunteers.  Indeed, this is something\r\n\r\nwe  have been doing all the time.  We have trained about  200\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders and we will do more.  Not  only  will  we\r\n\r\ntrain  mediators,  we  also  want  to  train  what  we   call\r\n\r\n\"persuaders\".  They may not do the actual mediation, but they\r\n\r\nwill go to the places where the disputes had taken place  and\r\n\r\ntry  to encourage the parties to come for mediation sessions.\r\n\r\nThis  is because Singaporeans still have misconceptions about\r\n\r\nmediation.  It is important to clear these doubts,  and  then\r\n\r\nthey  will  come.  We  will  do more  in  terms  of  training\r\n\r\nmediators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho also talks about education efforts. We will do\r\n\r\nmore.  In fact, we have done some already.  We are happy with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  has  transpired including from what I have  heard,  the\r\n\r\nquite well-received TV series in Chinese on mediation.   But,\r\n\r\ncertainly, we need to do more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, which is an important point, we will work with\r\n\r\nreferral sources - CDCs, grassroots advisers, the police, the\r\n\r\ncourts   -   to  facilitate  and  expedite  a  process  where\r\n\r\nreferrals can be made.  I think this is important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng has highlighted a key point, a very important\r\n\r\npoint,  which  has been on our minds in MinLaw for  sometime,\r\n\r\nwhich  is whether or not community mediation should  be  left\r\n\r\nentirely voluntary.  When I moved this Bill 3-4 years ago, in\r\n\r\nfact,  one or two MPs made this point at that time.  Because,\r\n\r\nat  that point in time, we decided that in order to encourage\r\n\r\nmore  Singaporeans to buy in and accept community  mediation,\r\n\r\nwe left it entirely voluntary.  I remember, in particular, Dr\r\n\r\nVasoo  asking, \"will that do the job?\"  Well, 3-4 years  have\r\n\r\nlapsed.  From experience, we should consider whether or not a\r\n\r\ncase has been made to do more, because the feedback is indeed\r\n\r\nthat  there  are some Singaporeans who want to  settle  their\r\n\r\ndisputes through mediation and they come for help.   But  the\r\n\r\nother  party just does not want to come, for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nWe have not decided on this yet but, certainly, I will ask my\r\n\r\nofficials  in MinLaw to study what more we can do  if  indeed\r\n\r\nthat is the way to go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I have mentioned just now the use of more\r\n\r\npersuaders, and this is something that we must do.  On top of\r\n\r\nthat, maybe we can consider other options, some of which have\r\n\r\nbeen used in other countries.  For example, whether or not to\r\n\r\nsay that if you receive a letter from the CMC, you must come.\r\n\r\nThis  is compulsory mediation.  Another would be, for parties\r\n\r\nwho  go to courts, before the courts will take up their case,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be asked to go for mediation first.  The  party's\r\n\r\nwilful  refusal  to attend mediation sessions  will  be  made\r\n\r\nknown  to  the  magistrate and will  constitute  one  of  the\r\n\r\nfactors  for  his consideration whether or  not  to  issue  a\r\n\r\nsummons for the matter to go to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourt.   That is a possibility.  The third is to empower  the\r\n\r\npolice to require the parties to go for mediation before  the\r\n\r\npolice  will investigate a police report.  Mdm Ho  says  that\r\n\r\nthese  are cases, especially the minor ones, which police  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to investigate immediately - try mediation  first.\r\n\r\nLet  me  just  say that at this point in time, we  are  still\r\n\r\nexploring the possibilities.  We will decide over the  course\r\n\r\nof the next 2-3 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me end this point by saying that it is indeed very\r\n\r\nimportant to create a culture of mediation on the ground, and\r\n\r\nwe  should  start with the young.  Mdm Ho has mentioned  this\r\n\r\nand  indeed,  this  is what we are doing.  Working  with  the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts and the Ministry of Education, we  have  a\r\n\r\npeer   mediation   programme  in   our   schools.    Because,\r\n\r\nultimately, if we can create a mindset in Singaporeans  where\r\n\r\nthey  will  try  to  settle some of  these  minor  relational\r\n\r\ndisputes on the ground by themselves   -  if not, they  could\r\n\r\nseek  this kampung ketua, your community mediators  -   then,\r\n\r\nover  the  long-term, this will help create, in Singapore,  a\r\n\r\nmore  cohesive  and more harmonious society.   Sir,  we  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  start with the young and permeate this culture  on\r\n\r\nthe ground, with the help of our grassroots leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take Mr Inderjit's cut, which is an important\r\n\r\ncut,  because he talks about creating in Singaporeans a  more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial spirit and, in particular, how we can improve\r\n\r\nour  bankruptcy  regime to do that.  Let me  just  assure  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit Singh that we do differentiate between bankrupts who\r\n\r\nhave become bankrupts because of genuine business failure and\r\n\r\nthose  who  become bankrupts through malpractice  or  are  at\r\n\r\nfault.   In  fact,  we  take  this  approach.   Members  will\r\n\r\nremember  that  in 1995, we introduced the discharge  by  the\r\n\r\nOfficial Assignee, the section 125 process.  When we  started\r\n\r\noff,  it  was  only  after  five years,  and  the  limit  was\r\n\r\n$250,000.  Then, as we administered this process, we enhanced\r\n\r\nthe regime.  Now, a bankrupt, who has a debt of up to half  a\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars, after three years, the OA can consider  him\r\n\r\nfor discharge.  I am glad to say that this process has worked\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince  it  was  introduced in 1995 to 31st March  2002,  over\r\n\r\n8,700 of such discharges have been made. The OA tells me that\r\n\r\nhe  is  ever mindful that this is something that he  must  be\r\n\r\nconcerned  about, because we want to create  in  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthis enterprising spirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This second chance approach is not only evident at the\r\n\r\npoint  of discharge but also at a point when the bankrupt  is\r\n\r\nworking  towards  discharge.  For example, now,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nprocess  where  bankrupts who apply to  become  directors  of\r\n\r\ncompanies or to manage a business, the OA can consider  these\r\n\r\napplications.   Indeed,  he tells me that  between  September\r\n\r\n1999  and  March  2002, he received a total of  262  of  such\r\n\r\napplications,  of  which only about 20% were  rejected.   The\r\n\r\nrest were either approved or withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure Mr Singh that our bankruptcy regime is\r\n\r\nnot  a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach.  He made this point when\r\n\r\nwe  debated  the  Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill  in  1999.   He\r\n\r\nargued  that we must be flexible, we must take cognisance  of\r\n\r\nvarious  factors, both in terms of how the  person  became  a\r\n\r\nbankrupt,  as  well  as  his conduct as  a  bankrupt.   These\r\n\r\nfactors are indeed being taken into consideration through the\r\n\r\nsection  125  route,  and  also allowing  the  bankrupt  more\r\n\r\nflexibility  in  doing business. We will do  more  for  these\r\n\r\nbankrupts.  From 1st March this year, the OA tells me that he\r\n\r\nhas  put  in place a system to categorise bankrupts according\r\n\r\nto  the  conduct and cause of insolvency. Those who are  more\r\n\r\ndeserving  will,  for  example,  be  given  privileges   more\r\n\r\nflexibily.  These are available to all bankrupts,  but if you\r\n\r\nfit into this category, for example, if you need to travel to\r\n\r\ndo  business or for any urgent matter, it will be  considered\r\n\r\nmore  favourably, or buying and selling a flat, or submission\r\n\r\nof statements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we are also going to introduce a pre-bankruptcy\r\n\r\nmediation service this year.  This is important because  that\r\n\r\nwill  help divert some of these potential bankrupts away from\r\n\r\nbankruptcy.  Through the mediation services offered by the OA\r\n\r\nofficers, we hope that some of these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npotential   bankrupts  will  not  be  made   bankrupts.    In\r\n\r\nparticular, if it is a genuine business failure, the  chances\r\n\r\nof  success will probably be higher. This will complement the\r\n\r\npost-bankruptcy service which has already been in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards self-destruct laws, this is being considered\r\n\r\nby  Mr Raymond Lim's Committee.   I do not think I will  pre-empt  him.  It is certainly a point which has arisen in  many\r\n\r\ncontexts  as we try to remake Singapore.  Let me, in  a  very\r\n\r\nshort fashion, say that it is a good point for us to say that\r\n\r\nwe  should review our laws all the time, especially  business\r\n\r\nlaws, which have short shelf lives, because times change  all\r\n\r\nthe  time.   I  want to assure Mr Singh that this  is  indeed\r\n\r\nbeing  done by the Ministries.  But he is proposing something\r\n\r\nwhich  should  engage our officials in a more pro-active  way\r\n\r\nfor them to be mindful whether laws should still apply.  That\r\n\r\ncan be considered by the Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards legal infrastructure, a short point will be\r\n\r\nthat we do all we can to ensure that Singapore remains on top\r\n\r\nof  the  situation in terms of cutting edge areas.  Both,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  MinLaw and, in fact, even our courts, our  judges,\r\n\r\nalso  ensure  that  they know what it takes  to  be  able  to\r\n\r\nadminister the laws.  MinLaw, for example, in terms of IT, if\r\n\r\nMembers  recall in this House, we have done many things.   We\r\n\r\nhave  passed laws, and introduced electronic filing,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave done many things on  patents and other matters to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  we  are on top of this area.  For example, we  will  go\r\n\r\nforward  and  review the Copyright Act to take  into  account\r\n\r\nrecent advances in digital technology.  Judges themselves  go\r\n\r\nfor  training.  If Members remember, 2-3 years ago, they went\r\n\r\nfor  a  life sciences course conducted by the NUS, which  was\r\n\r\nquite   widely   publicised.   Judicial   commissioners   are\r\n\r\nappointed to the Bench. They are practitioners who have  vast\r\n\r\nexperience and who bring these experiences with them  to  the\r\n\r\nBench.  The latest was Ms Belinda Ang, who was appointed as a\r\n\r\nJC  and  now,  in fact, sits in a specially set up  Admiralty\r\n\r\nCourt.   The other move the courts are taking is  to  set  up\r\n\r\nspecialist courts.  They are also considering setting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  an IP court.  Indeed, if need be, assessors are appointed\r\n\r\nto help the judges to decide cases, as in a recent case where\r\n\r\nDr  A  J Nihols of Probitas Corporation was appointed  as  an\r\n\r\nassessor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, arbitration also offers a route for parties who\r\n\r\nwant  somebody  of their own choosing, whom  they  think  can\r\n\r\ndecide  their  dispute in a fair way, they can  appoint  that\r\n\r\nperson  as  an  arbitrator. And, certainly, with  the  recent\r\n\r\nrelaxation in our arbitration regime, that will come to pass.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is on land use. Let me just say that we\r\n\r\nhave  taken  account of the feedback that we  have  received,\r\n\r\nthat SLA should do more, so that grassroots organisations can\r\n\r\nuse the vacant lands in HDB estates more easily.  Hence, what\r\n\r\nwe  have  done  is  that since August 2000,  we  gave  a  70%\r\n\r\ndiscount  for  the use of these lands.  A recent  review  was\r\n\r\ncarried  out  and SLA has decided that we will move  it  even\r\n\r\nfurther down.  Instead of charging market rates, April  2000,\r\n\r\nwe  gave  70%, and they only pay 30%; now, we are going  even\r\n\r\nfurther  down,  so that a new system will now be  implemented\r\n\r\nwhere  grassroots  leaders, who are using  vacant  lands  for\r\n\r\ncommunity  purposes,  will enjoy  an  85%  discount.   For  a\r\n\r\nfootball  field of some 6,000 square metres, the market  rate\r\n\r\nis  $1,500.  In April 2000, it cost $450, but it will now  be\r\n\r\nonly $150 a month.  I think this is quite affordable.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is to make more information available to\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders, and indeed to all users of  State  lands\r\n\r\nand  premises.   SLA will start an e-portal  in  2-3  months'\r\n\r\ntime.  This e-portal will put out all the lands under the SLA\r\n\r\n- State land, premises and buildings, designated not just for\r\n\r\ncommunity use but also for institutional and commercial uses.\r\n\r\nThen  all  potential and interested users of state  land  and\r\n\r\npremises will just have to click a button and know what is on\r\n\r\noffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

The main reason is the threat of  stronger\r\n\r\ncompetition from the neighbouring countries such as  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand   Indonesia,  which  are  two  very  low-cost   operating\r\n\r\ncountries.  At the same time, we also have to compete against\r\n\r\nemerging cities like Hong Kong and Shanghai.  Then, there  is\r\n\r\nthe  looming threat of China as a formidable competitor which\r\n\r\nis  soaking up substantial foreign direct investments (FDIs).\r\n\r\nWe  are  constantly reminded of the threat of China,  but  we\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  really told as to how  this  threat  can  be\r\n\r\ncontained.   Better still, we would like to  figure  out  how\r\n\r\nbest  we  can  ride  this huge juggernaut of  China,  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister had said last year, as this country moves forward to\r\n\r\nbecome one of the world's largest economies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry  what  are  his Ministry's views  of  the  long-term\r\n\r\nregional and international competitiveness of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to competitiveness, we note that there are\r\n\r\nseveral international independent agencies that conduct world-wide  competitive  ratings of different countries.   What  is\r\n\r\ninteresting  is that I note that different agencies  seem  to\r\n\r\ngive   different  assessment  ratings  for  Singapore.    For\r\n\r\nexample, the well-known Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)  in\r\n\r\nits report of 16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAsian  and Australasian countries covered in 1997-2001,   has\r\n\r\nmoved  Singapore  from  second  place  to  the  top  position\r\n\r\nregionally  for the 2002-2006 period.  So, we have  overtaken\r\n\r\nHong Kong for the top place.  However, on a world-wide basis,\r\n\r\nthis  EIU report has moved Singapore downwards, from  7th  to\r\n\r\n9th position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, another agency, called the World\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness Yearbook 2002, has ranked Singapore  the  5th\r\n\r\nmost competitive country, slipping three notches from the 2nd\r\n\r\nposition  last  year.   So,  both  the  EIU  and  the   World\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness Yearbook 2002 have moved Singapore  downwards\r\n\r\nin world-wide economic rankings.  Is this an area of concern?\r\n\r\nAre we losing our competitiveness?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, what I feel remarkable is that for a small\r\n\r\ncountry  like  Singapore, with no natural resources,  a  very\r\n\r\nsmall  population, a very small domestic market, and  a  very\r\n\r\nlimited  number of home-grown companies, we have consistently\r\n\r\nachieved  high  international rankings by the most  respected\r\n\r\ninternational agencies around the world.  This  testifies  to\r\n\r\nthe  excellent  achievements and hard work of the  Government\r\n\r\nand  the people in getting ourselves to this stage.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  crucial  question is, can we continue  to  achieve  this\r\n\r\nphenomenal growth and sterling results?  Will the  future  be\r\n\r\nas  bright as before?  Or would it turn for the worse?   Will\r\n\r\nSingapore be sliding precipitously downhill henceforth?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in line with the review of international\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,  I  would like to ask the  Minister  how  he\r\n\r\nintends  to  help  reduce  the  overall  cost  structure   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  is  a  perennial  complaint  of  the   local\r\n\r\ncompanies  that  the cost of doing business in  Singapore  is\r\n\r\njust  too high.  In this respect, one of the major cost items\r\n\r\nis  electricity consumption.  The Government formed  the  new\r\n\r\nEnergy  Management Authority (EMA) last year.   The  EMA  has\r\n\r\nannounced  a  schedule  of  plans to  liberalise  the  energy\r\n\r\nmarket.   Can the Minister update us on the latest  situation\r\n\r\nwith regard to the EMA, and whether energy deregulation would\r\n\r\nreally lead to lower prices?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, among the many industries that the Government\r\n\r\nintends to promote is the bio-sciences.  Recently, there  was\r\n\r\na   report  that  the  A*STAR  has  been  charged  with   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of promoting a biomedical hub  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  am  concerned to read in press reports  that  Mr\r\n\r\nPhilip Yeo, Chairman of A*STAR, has an undisclosed budget  to\r\n\r\nuse.  Even before getting started, it is said that the centre\r\n\r\nwill  now double in size in five years.  I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  if he could give more details  on  the  actual\r\n\r\nplans  of  the  Government in the promotion of biotechnology.\r\n\r\nWhat  are the real benefits that can be derived, and  whether\r\n\r\nthe  expected  hundreds  of millions,  or  even  billions  of\r\n\r\ndollars,  that will be spent on this biomedical hub  will  be\r\n\r\nworthwhile?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, as my\r\n\r\ncolleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee, has stated, Singapore has  been\r\n\r\nhighly   praised  by  many  international  rating   agencies.\r\n\r\nDespite slipping a few positions here and there, we are still\r\n\r\nwithin  the  top 10 most competitive countries in the  world.\r\n\r\nThese ratings are not just mere morale boosters but they have\r\n\r\nhelped   Singapore  to  attract  the  much   needed   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments.   Going forward, however, the  competition  will\r\n\r\nbecome more intense, especially with the rise of North  Asian\r\n\r\nand  other destinations with competitive cost structure.  The\r\n\r\nrating  agencies serve as a barometer to the global  hunters.\r\n\r\nWe must maintain our competitiveness in their views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is, how successful would we be in retaining\r\n\r\nand  improving our international competitiveness ranking with\r\n\r\nthe new Budget?  In our effort to attract new FDIs and global\r\n\r\ntalents,   as  well  as retain existing ones,  what  are  the\r\n\r\nspecific strategies formulated to: (i) reduce the total  cost\r\n\r\nof doing business in Singapore; (ii) address the flip side of\r\n\r\nthe  cost, which is the expected yield of business in or from\r\n\r\nSingapore; and (iii) address Singapore's role in the region?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me briefly elaborate on each of these points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, on reducing the total cost of doing business in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This would include\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  just the overt costs like tax, land and labour, but also\r\n\r\nthe  covert costs like the cost of living and the quality  of\r\n\r\nlife.  Why would a top talent, who is mobile, choose to  stay\r\n\r\nin  Singapore if he is a Singaporean, or come to Singapore if\r\n\r\nhe  is  a foreigner?  Is Singapore exciting enough to attract\r\n\r\nand retain them?  How livable is Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, on expected yield. Empirical evidence shows that\r\n\r\npeople  migrate from low-cost rural areas to high-cost cities\r\n\r\nin  search  of jobs or yields.  Ten years ago, setting  up  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  in the major cities in China would cost a  fraction\r\n\r\nof   the   current  cost.   However,  today,  the   Economist\r\n\r\nIntelligence Unit (EIU) has estimated US$60 billion per  year\r\n\r\ninvestments  pouring into China, and that  constitutes  about\r\n\r\n70%  of all the FDIs to Asia.  Certainly, the expected  yield\r\n\r\nin  such  places must have been perceived to  be  very  high,\r\n\r\ndespite the rising cost.  While we do not have the hinterland\r\n\r\nor  domestic market size of our larger neighbours, we have  a\r\n\r\nmore  transparent and predictable business regime, plus  high\r\n\r\nquality  human capital.  How can we leverage on these aspects\r\n\r\nof  our competitive advantage to improve the yield, the  risk\r\n\r\nreward  ratio for the global FDIs and talents?  In fact,  how\r\n\r\ncan  we  improve the balance sheets for both the company  and\r\n\r\nthe individual?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, what is our role in the region? The\r\n\r\nGovernment should be praised for stretching our tentacles  to\r\n\r\nput in place a series of FTAs with partners across the globe.\r\n\r\nNearer  home,  however,  we  must  do  more  to  improve  our\r\n\r\nrelationship with our immediate neighbours.  To many FDIs, we\r\n\r\nare  still  part of a bigger region and hence, in considering\r\n\r\ntheir   business  location,  they  will  also  consider   our\r\n\r\nstrategic position in our neighbourhood.  They want  to  know\r\n\r\nif we are the gateway to any market, what is our role and our\r\n\r\nrelationship  with  our  neighbours  in  the  region.    What\r\n\r\nstrategies  do we have to achieve this?  Are we open  to  new\r\n\r\nways  of  doing  business?  It is often  said  that  the  new\r\n\r\nbusiness environment requires not just IQ but EQ and CQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Low, you have 30 seconds left.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Singapore has been criticised as lacking\r\n\r\nin  EQ and CQ, which is cultural quotient.

I would like to\r\n\r\nask  if  our  Ministry is ready to incorporate  these  social\r\n\r\nscientists  as  an  integral part of our trade  and  business\r\n\r\nteams.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as we move into the\r\n\r\nknowledge  era,  the  structure of Singapore's  economy  will\r\n\r\nundergo fundamental changes.  This, coupled with our maturing\r\n\r\neconomy,  is expected to result in (i) a slower growth  rate;\r\n\r\n(ii)  a  greater reliance on external demand which rose  from\r\n\r\n68% of GDP in 1990 to 77% in 2000; and, (iii) a manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector  which  is  becoming more knowledge intensive  with  a\r\n\r\ncorresponding reduction of manufacturing jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regionally, the Japanese locomotive is declining, while\r\n\r\nthere  is  competitive pressure coming from China  and  other\r\n\r\nnewly  industrialising countries.  Within ASEAN,  Indonesia's\r\n\r\nrecovery  is uncertain and, at best, difficult.  Malaysia  is\r\n\r\nmoving away from her primary industry base and is trying very\r\n\r\nhard  to  beat  us  in the seaport, airport,  petrochemicals,\r\n\r\ninfocomms and logistics sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly industrialising countries, with their mass of\r\n\r\ncheap  labour,  will focus on mainstream economic  activities\r\n\r\nthat  are labour intensive to provide jobs for their  people.\r\n\r\nThe  developed countries in the western world have plenty  of\r\n\r\nresources   in   technology,  capital   and   infrastructure.\r\n\r\nSingapore, unfortunately, is caught in between.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such an economic landscape, I too would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister what is the Government's strategy to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore internationally more competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 35 years, we relied on foreign direct\r\n\r\ninvestments  (FDIs)  and MNCs, as well  as  GLCs  to  provide\r\n\r\ngrowth, with SMEs playing the supporting role. Would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  tried and tested approach continue to provide Singapore\r\n\r\nwith future growth, or should we now emphasise on building an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial economy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My view is that while we continue to attract FDIs to\r\n\r\ngrow  our  knowledge intensive industry, we must nurture  the\r\n\r\nfuture  entrepreneurial economy.  To do the former is  easier\r\n\r\nas  we have been successfully doing it over the years and are\r\n\r\nquite capable of continuing.  However, to do the latter  will\r\n\r\nbe  more  tricky as the environment must be right for  it  to\r\n\r\ntake root and bear fruit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may note that Singapore's early economy has been\r\n\r\nfounded  primarily  upon trade and  commerce.   Many  of  our\r\n\r\npioneering  fathers  were businessmen, traders,  shopkeepers,\r\n\r\netc,  or  dreamt of becoming one.  They all desired owning  a\r\n\r\nbusiness, and entrepreneurship was in their blood.  How  then\r\n\r\nare  we to re-create this spirit of risk-taking?  Have we got\r\n\r\ntoo comfortable?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new economy with a thriving entrepreneur sector cannot\r\n\r\nbe  created  overnight.   We need the  essential  ingredients\r\n\r\nplaced  in  the right environment.  The Government should  at\r\n\r\nleast try to create this environment for entrepreneurship  to\r\n\r\nflourish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be these smaller companies that will find the\r\n\r\nright  niche  industries to survive or even thrive  in.   One\r\n\r\nsuch   success  story,  which  is  often  told,  is  Creative\r\n\r\nTechnology.   Singapore  certainly  needs  many   more   such\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nMany factors are needed to make up the right environment  for\r\n\r\na  successful entrepreneurial economy.  I will speak on three\r\n\r\nmajor ones.  They are, one, plentiful bright ideas; two,  low\r\n\r\ncost  of failure, including social costs; and, three,  access\r\n\r\nto  funds.  Firstly, without bright ideas, there will  be  no\r\n\r\nstart-ups and no ventures.  We should not only attract  ideas\r\n\r\nlocally  but  also ideas from all over the world to  incubate\r\n\r\nhere.  Successful ideas will then find their market globally.\r\n\r\nSo  EDB should not only attract FDIs but also actively pursue\r\n\r\nforeign ideas to locate in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Secondly, there is a general stigma attached  to\r\n\r\nfailure in Singapore.  This is the main cause of the aversion\r\n\r\nto  anything  risky  among the better trained  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  mindset needs to be changed through education in  order\r\n\r\nto  lower  or  even  eliminate the social  cost  of  business\r\n\r\nfailure.   I  would like to remind Members that, in  America,\r\n\r\nCEOs  of failed start-ups are actually sought after for their\r\n\r\nexperience,  so  that mistakes made can  be  avoided  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worse in Singapore is that many entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nalso  have  to  risk personal wealth in order to  fund  their\r\n\r\nventures.   This  could  lead to personal  bankruptcies  when\r\n\r\nfailure  occurs.  Surely, persons who contribute  their  good\r\n\r\nideas  should  not  be made to risk their total  savings,  or\r\n\r\nhouse  as  well.   This factor is one big difference  between\r\n\r\nBritain and America.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Half a minute more, Dr Chen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> This leads to the requirement\r\n\r\non  access to funds.  The Government has set up TIF.  So far,\r\n\r\nthe   fund  has  been  mainly  invested  in  big  and  famous\r\n\r\ninternational VC funds.  These are safe investments.  It  may\r\n\r\nhave  helped to kick-start the VC industry in Singapore,  but\r\n\r\nit    does    little    to   encourage    entrepreneurs    or\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.  The Government should therefore look  into\r\n\r\nhow  it can take more direct equity participation in SMEs and\r\n\r\nstart-ups to encourage entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a word about flexibility. To compete in the\r\n\r\nnew  era,  we  must develop the skill of flexibility  without\r\n\r\nsacrificing fundamental principles.  This skill must permeate\r\n\r\nevery  level  of  our  society,  right  from  civil  servants\r\n\r\nexecuting Government policies to businessmen making  a  deal.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why Singaporeans are not as successful  as\r\n\r\nthe Taiwanese and ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Dr Chong Weng\r\n\r\nChiew.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I have two\r\n\r\npoints  to  raise.   Mr Gan Kim Yong's  call  for  an  inter-ministerial committee to ensure our competitiveness was on my\r\n\r\nmind, and I support it.  Our statutory boards may be proud of\r\n\r\npast  laurels  and be complacent to challenges  from  budding\r\n\r\ncompetitors.   But  let it be reminded that  if  any  of  our\r\n\r\nnational  agencies fall, Singaporeans' livelihood falls  with\r\n\r\nit as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA employs about 30,000 workers and, if it falters, it\r\n\r\nwould  be  held  responsible for the fates  of  these  fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Today, SIA is more than just a private company\r\n\r\nmotivated   by  profit.   SIA  employs  about  6,000   flight\r\n\r\nstewardesses, some of whom though are not local, we should be\r\n\r\nconcerned with their performance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans watch with concern the challenges posed to\r\n\r\nmany of our national brand names, such as Changi Airport  and\r\n\r\nSIA.   They are wondering if our competitors would skin these\r\n\r\ninstitutions alive.  Jobs are a primary concern these days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, let me reiterate my two calls.\r\n\r\nFirst, setting up an inter-ministerial committee that compose\r\n\r\nalso  of private sector voices, some of whom have echoed  the\r\n\r\nvery  problems  PSA  faces today long time  ago.   Second,  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  of  the competitiveness of our national brand  names,\r\n\r\nsuch as PSA, SIA, MRT, LRT, Power Supply, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, fundamentally, as a\r\n\r\ncountry  and  a colony with many things going for  us,  brand\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  one  that we can be proud of,  with  its  high\r\n\r\nregional and global awareness and attributes that businesses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwant.   But the brand needs to be continually reinforced,  or\r\n\r\nit  will fade and pale in comparison when others emerge  from\r\n\r\nthe  not too far horizon.  After hearing the concerns  raised\r\n\r\nby so many hon. Members in the Budget debate, I am reinforced\r\n\r\nin my belief that much still needs to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's competitiveness cannot be just left to the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.  There must be an obsession to drive the cost\r\n\r\nof  doing business in Singapore continuously downwards.   For\r\n\r\nwithout  a  strong  home base, there  is  little  chance  for\r\n\r\nsurvival for both SMEs and large local corporates where  they\r\n\r\nattempt  to set foot beyond our shores.  We cannot be  merely\r\n\r\nsatisfied   with  the  small  domestic  market   within   our\r\n\r\nboundaries.  The call to stake out the area within  a  seven-hour  plane  ride from Singapore as our hinterland  is  worth\r\n\r\nstepping up to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I would like to ask the Minister if enough has\r\n\r\nbeen  done  to  ensure the international  competitiveness  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Firstly, is there adequate attention focused  on\r\n\r\nthe  sizable elements of business costs that are attributable\r\n\r\nto  the  Government and statutory boards'  fees  and  levies?\r\n\r\nThis  must be continuously driven down.  Perhaps, we  need  a\r\n\r\nbody to be vigilantly looking at this, year in, year out,  to\r\n\r\nensure  a  continuous  improvement.  What  other  performance\r\n\r\nmeasures that the Minister needs to put in place in order  to\r\n\r\nachieve  this,  just  as  EDB has set  its  annual  goals  of\r\n\r\nattracting   FDIs?   Secondly,  are  our   SMEs   and   large\r\n\r\ncorporations adequately supported by incentives and  measures\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  they are well-positioned  to  take  on  the\r\n\r\ncompetition  when they make their forays abroad?   Is  enough\r\n\r\nbeing  done  so  that companies here build up  the  requisite\r\n\r\nintellectual  property and technology bases that  will  allow\r\n\r\nthem  to  penetrate  this extended hinterland  with  superior\r\n\r\nproduct and service offerings?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the sentiments that are popularly espoused\r\n\r\nof the largest corporations crowding out the smaller ones,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that critical scale is required to weather the perils\r\n\r\nbeyond our shores.  As such,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  there been enough efforts and measures put in place  to\r\n\r\nenergise  our larger corporations to be the vanguard  of  our\r\n\r\noverseas drive?  While we can let the market forces take  its\r\n\r\ncourse  and  let winners emerge, I ask if the Minister  would\r\n\r\nconsider that a more robust approach would be to identify and\r\n\r\nnurture  would-be  global and regional champions  and  turbo-charge  them  to  give them a higher chance of  survival  and\r\n\r\nsuccess.  I am not saying that we do not pay attention to the\r\n\r\neco-system  where smaller firms can thrive  in  the  country.\r\n\r\nWhat I say is let us hedge our bets and do both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it would be much appreciated if the Minister\r\n\r\ncould  also  give us his insights on how the series  of  FTAs\r\n\r\nthat  are  in  place  would further  enhance  our  companies'\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  in  the global league.   We  need  a  strong\r\n\r\nexternal wing to complement our activities on shore  so  that\r\n\r\nwe  can ensure jobs and more jobs.  The sooner we develop and\r\n\r\nspread the wing, the better off we are going to be.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, I would like to focus on the\r\n\r\nunglamorous  but  nonetheless important contributors  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   economy.   In  pursuing  a  knowledge-based   and\r\n\r\nintensive  economy  and,  in emphasising  the  importance  of\r\n\r\nemploying  technology, we have actually reached  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  many  sectors  of the old economy feel  alienated  and\r\n\r\nignored.   They feel that the various incentives  are  skewed\r\n\r\ntowards the new economy type businesses and are not meant for\r\n\r\nthem.   In  fact,  some  even feel that  there  are  actually\r\n\r\ndisincentives to doing more out of Singapore.   For  example,\r\n\r\ngarment  manufacturing  now runs  on  very  similar  economic\r\n\r\nmodels   to  electronics  contract  manufacturing,  requiring\r\n\r\nsimilar  competencies, such as the application of  technology\r\n\r\ntowards state-of-the-art equipment for Government's teaching,\r\n\r\nlabelling, packing, sourcing networks, inventory control  and\r\n\r\nlogistics  capabilities.  However, the garment  manufacturers\r\n\r\nface limitations to employing foreign talent in designing and\r\n\r\ncutting as these are considered as non-professional in nature\r\n\r\nand  classified  somewhat differently by the Government.   As\r\n\r\nsuch, many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  forced  to  relocate manufacturing activities  elsewhere\r\n\r\nwhere  there  are  lower  or  no  barriers  to  the  flow  of\r\n\r\nexpertise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister not to neglect\r\n\r\nor,  worse  still, ignore the growth potential of  these  old\r\n\r\neconomy businesses and to actively think of ways to help them\r\n\r\nleverage on our hub capabilities and grow.  The signalling is\r\n\r\nalso  crucial,  as how else can we explain the  poor  take-up\r\n\r\nrate of vacancies in the marine sector in spite of the rising\r\n\r\nunemployment.  The sector is perceived to be unglamorous, not\r\n\r\nthe new economy type.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a related point, many old economy businesses\r\n\r\nhave   successfully  grown  outside  Singapore,  mostly  very\r\n\r\nquietly and without Government's assistance.  Yet, they  have\r\n\r\nembraced the very essence of our economic survival, which  is\r\n\r\nto  move  beyond our finite domestic market.  They have  done\r\n\r\nall  this,  whilst the national preoccupation, including  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  has  been  the  domestic  economy.    Sir,   for\r\n\r\nbusinesses  which  have hitherto done well,  the  inertia  of\r\n\r\nexploring  outside  the  comfort of  Singapore  is  extremely\r\n\r\ngreat.   For the Government, it is our constant reference  to\r\n\r\nour  domestic growth rate that sets the tone.  If  I  am  not\r\n\r\nmistaken,  the  Minister  still owes  me  the  quarterly  GNP\r\n\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister to help the\r\n\r\nentire  economy  shift the emphasis from having  domestically\r\n\r\noriented supply to meeting globally generated demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, it has been many years since we\r\n\r\ndefined  our  strategy of developing a second  wing  for  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy.  Many of our companies,  big  and  small,\r\n\r\nGLCs  and private sector enterprises have tried to globalise,\r\n\r\nbut  with  limited success.  There are many reasons  for  our\r\n\r\nlimited success, but I will not address them here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest a simple strategy which will\r\n\r\ngreatly  improve  the  chances of success  for  many  of  our\r\n\r\ncompanies as they try to globalise.  We need to help to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate  a  culture of partnership, a departure from our  past\r\n\r\npractice of distrust between GLCs, big companies and  smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies.   The  fact is that each company, whether  big  or\r\n\r\nsmall,  has  its own areas of competencies, and also  no  one\r\n\r\ncompany  has  all  the  strengths in  all  the  areas  of  an\r\n\r\nindustry.   It  is  therefore only  logical  that  we  should\r\n\r\nencourage   all   the  relevant  companies  to   pool   their\r\n\r\ncompetencies  together to form a strong alliance  when  going\r\n\r\noverseas,  much  like  what  the  Japanese  and  the   French\r\n\r\ncompanies have been doing for so many years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be a very important role for many of our\r\n\r\nGovernment  economic  agencies who could  play  the  role  of\r\n\r\nmatchmakers  and facilitators.  Sir, the clustering  approach\r\n\r\nwill  address the size and scale issues that Mr Wee Siew  Kim\r\n\r\ntalked about just now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the long term, instead of Government agencies,\r\n\r\nwe  need the private sector to lead initiatives like building\r\n\r\nconsortiums  and cluster associations.  Currently,  the  EDB,\r\n\r\nNSTB  and  other  agencies call the shots  for  many  of  our\r\n\r\nindustrial  groupings and consortiums.  I suggest we  reverse\r\n\r\nthe  whole thing and create a few consortiums asking  private\r\n\r\nsector  champions to lead them, perhaps with some secretariat\r\n\r\nsupport from the Government agencies initially until this can\r\n\r\ntake  off.   Some examples of such associations from  the  US\r\n\r\nare,  first  of  all,  the Fabless Semiconductor  Association\r\n\r\n(FSA);  second,  SEMATECH, the consortium of  big  and  small\r\n\r\nsemiconductor companies.  They have had tremendous success in\r\n\r\ndriving  the industries in the US, and I think we should  try\r\n\r\nthis approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nhistorically,  we  have  been very successful  in  attracting\r\n\r\nforeign investments into Singapore and the recent tax reforms\r\n\r\nproposed  by the Finance Minister will help in some  ways  to\r\n\r\nattract  additional foreign investments here.   But  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  suggest that maybe it is time for us to expand  our\r\n\r\neconomic boundaries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeyond our shores.  China has been touted as a threat to  our\r\n\r\neconomy, but I would suggest that China is not just a  threat\r\n\r\nbut also an opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister therefore to\r\n\r\nelaborate  what are the strategies that we have to  help  our\r\n\r\nlocal  companies,  our  local enterprises,  to  venture  into\r\n\r\nChina.   In  particular, I would like  to  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  we  could  encourage the GLCs to take  the  lead  in\r\n\r\nspearheading our thrust into China.  These GLCs, as  DPM  Lee\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned yesterday, have size and management expertise.\r\n\r\nThey  are  also  much more experienced in overseas  ventures.\r\n\r\nThey  are therefore well positioned to establish a beach-head\r\n\r\nin  China.   Thereafter, they can then help bring  along  the\r\n\r\nlocal  small and medium sized enterprises, which may be ready\r\n\r\nto  go  abroad  but  may  need some initial  help.   This  is\r\n\r\nprobably one positive role that the GLCs can play in  helping\r\n\r\nthe SMEs here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, for SMEs venturing into China is not an easy\r\n\r\ntask.   Take  human  resource,  for  example.   It  is   very\r\n\r\ndifficult  and  often costly to persuade  Singaporean  senior\r\n\r\nmanagers to work in China.  Having identified a suitable  and\r\n\r\ncapable  candidate, we need to pay for his  relocation  cost.\r\n\r\nWe  need to give him additional overseas allowance.  We  need\r\n\r\nto  bear  the cost of his lodging and, if he has  heeded  the\r\n\r\ncall  of  the Government and got married, we need to pay  for\r\n\r\nhis spouse's allowance and even, sometimes, compensate her if\r\n\r\nshe  needs to quit her job.  And if he follows PM's call  and\r\n\r\nhave  several children, we may also have to bear the cost  of\r\n\r\nhis  children's  education  in international  schools  there.\r\n\r\nSir,  going  to China is a very expensive affair.  Sometimes,\r\n\r\nit  is  twice  as  costly  as  the  same  person  working  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I would therefore like to request the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  providing financial and tax incentives  to  support\r\n\r\nand   help  local  companies  to  venture  into  China.    In\r\n\r\nparticular, would the Minister consider providing   financial\r\n\r\nand  tax  incentives to support and help local  companies  to\r\n\r\nventure  into  China?   In  particular,  would  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider providing incentives to help defray part of the cost\r\n\r\nof sending staff overseas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Wee Siew Kim, can you take your two\r\n\r\ncuts together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim:</b> Sir, I will take both cuts together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pull of China, both for investments and talents, can\r\n\r\nno  longer be ignored.  The emergence of China presents  both\r\n\r\nan  opportunity as well as a threat.  The threats  have  been\r\n\r\npounded  into  our awareness.  There is no need  to  belabour\r\n\r\nthem.   What is key is our response to take advantage of  the\r\n\r\nopportunities.   While  we  are  always  talking  about   the\r\n\r\nbehemoth,  China, it may be worthwhile to hear the Minister's\r\n\r\nperspectives  on how similar would be our responses  when  we\r\n\r\nturn our sights at the other lurking behemoth, India.  I hope\r\n\r\nthat   the   Minister  would  elaborate  on  what   are   the\r\n\r\nopportunities these two markets present to our companies  and\r\n\r\nwhere the emphasis should be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been touted as a service hub - efficient\r\n\r\nand  incorruptibly predictable.  We must, therefore,  have  a\r\n\r\nrole  that  these two markets can benefit from.  We  must  be\r\n\r\nable  to  fill a value-added niche, one where we can exact  a\r\n\r\npremium and ensure the continuous survival of our people.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be  a worthwhile goal to aspire towards having  either\r\n\r\nChina or India, or both countries, ranked alongside the US as\r\n\r\none of our engines of growth.  Is this achievable and in what\r\n\r\ntimeframe?   In  this discussion, I hope the  Minister  would\r\n\r\nalso  consider informing us on how our neighbours will  react\r\n\r\nto  our  response and our confidence in staking a future  for\r\n\r\nourselves.  We must not assume that our neighbours will  stay\r\n\r\nput  and not raise their ante to compete with us in these two\r\n\r\nlarge markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go on to the second cut. Our neighbours,\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  Indonesia,  have  only  recovered  in  varying\r\n\r\ndegrees  from the aftermath of the Asian crisis.   They  have\r\n\r\nbeen  key engines of growth for our economy.  In time,  these\r\n\r\ntwo  neighbouring economies will be strong again, and  it  is\r\n\r\nvery likely that we will continue to have a role to play,  as\r\n\r\nlong as we position\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nourselves correctly in the meantime.  In addition, continuous\r\n\r\nengagement will buy us the time as we breathe life  into  the\r\n\r\nother  sectors  that we are betting on for the  longer  term,\r\n\r\nsectors such as life sciences and the services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we should not leapfrog too quickly out of this\r\n\r\nregion  and  jettison these two economies while  we  set  our\r\n\r\nsights farther afield.  Could the Minister give his views  on\r\n\r\nthe   state   of  economic  cooperation  with  Malaysia   and\r\n\r\nIndonesia?  What measures must we have in order that we  stay\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  their needs in spite of their many attempts  to\r\n\r\nsupplant  us?   How  can  we  extend  the  hand  of  economic\r\n\r\ncooperation  such that, when they emerge from their  problems\r\n\r\nand  pick themselves up again, we could grow alongside  them,\r\n\r\nhaving them feel the nascent services sector along the way?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Leong Horn Kee, you can take both cuts\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Thank you, Sir. I would like to\r\n\r\njoin  my colleagues to ask the Minister for an update on  the\r\n\r\nvarious   Free  Trade  Agreements  (FTAs)  under  negotiation\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and the other countries.  In particular,  I\r\n\r\nam  very  interested to know the status of the  proposed  FTA\r\n\r\nbetween  ASEAN and China, the FTA between Singapore and  USA,\r\n\r\nand also the proposed FTA between Singapore and Japan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said in recent reports that FTAs will\r\n\r\nbring substantial benefits to Singapore, such as the creation\r\n\r\nof  more  jobs.   This is good.  It would be  useful  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister  can  give  details on how  he  feels  FTAs  can  be\r\n\r\nbeneficial for Singapore.  In fact, it is said that  FTA  can\r\n\r\nbe  helpful  to the entire region, as it will be instrumental\r\n\r\nin  promoting free trade practices and investments from other\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries  into  our  region.   As  the  FTAs  are\r\n\r\nexpected to bring substantial benefits, I would like to  urge\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Trade and Industry to expedite the completion\r\n\r\nof these various FTAs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on the restructuring of MTI and its\r\n\r\nstatutory boards.  It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappears  from  recent  press  reports  that  it  is  becoming\r\n\r\nfashionable for renaming of statutory boards.  Yesterday,  Mr\r\n\r\nTan  Soo  Khoon  mentioned  this.   For  example,  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Trade and Industry, we have read about a spate of\r\n\r\nchanges in the names of its statutory boards.  First, we read\r\n\r\nabout  the NSTB being renamed as A*STAR.  When I first  heard\r\n\r\nthis, I thought it was a new Grammy Award or a new TV series.\r\n\r\nNext,  we heard about the creation of IE Singapore, in  place\r\n\r\nof  the  old  statutory board called TDB.  More recently,  we\r\n\r\nwere  sprung  with a surprise of a new entity  called  SPRING\r\n\r\nSingapore, which is actually a remake of the former PSB.  For\r\n\r\na  while,  I thought that the launch of SPRING Singapore  was\r\n\r\nfor a new line of seasonal fashion wear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the public look at these changes, they do not\r\n\r\nreally  understand why familiar old names like TDB,  PSB  and\r\n\r\nNSTB  are  being  discarded.  As Mr Lim Hng  Kiang  has  said\r\n\r\nearlier, there is brand value in some of these names.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, it is good to give statutory boards new names\r\n\r\nto  reflect  their new roles and responsibilities.   However,\r\n\r\nfor  new  names,  we  have  to  incur  substantial  costs  on\r\n\r\nlaunching  expenses  in the form of corporate  brochures  and\r\n\r\nother  collaterals.   The Minister may wish  to  explain  why\r\n\r\nthere is this sudden remaking of the statutory boards.  There\r\n\r\nmust be a grand concept plan behind this, I believe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do note that there is one statutory board\r\n\r\nthat   has  not  been  renamed,  and  that  is  the   Sentosa\r\n\r\nDevelopment Corporation (SDC).  We Singaporeans have come  to\r\n\r\nremember Sentosa as a very quaint name which has been changed\r\n\r\nfrom  the previous name called Pulau Belakang Mati.  While  I\r\n\r\nam not urging the Minister to change the name of SDC, I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask him what are his Ministry's plans with regard  to\r\n\r\nthe future development of Sentosa.  We understand that nearly\r\n\r\na  billion  dollars  have been spent on Sentosa  for  various\r\n\r\nprojects  to  date  and more will be  spent  in  future.   As\r\n\r\nSentosa is a playground for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and a major tourist attraction for foreigners, I\r\n\r\nhope  that  some bold and imaginative plans are in store  for\r\n\r\nSentosa.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, many Members have raised the\r\n\r\nissue of the cost of doing business in Singapore, and I would\r\n\r\nlike to talk about this in the context of the competitiveness\r\n\r\nof the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We really have to look into how we can lower costs to\r\n\r\nkeep  manufacturing companies invested in  Singapore.   While\r\n\r\nthe  tax measures are important, we need to address the  many\r\n\r\nother  cost issues, including the many hidden taxes  which  I\r\n\r\nhave talked about.  With our current approach of levying such\r\n\r\ntaxes  at  source, companies are paying too much of  the  tax\r\n\r\npayable upfront, resulting in much lower margins, compared to\r\n\r\nequivalent  companies  in  other  countries.   We   need   to\r\n\r\nrationalise and balance between paying tax upfront  and  that\r\n\r\npaid at the end by way of corporate income taxes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to creatively find solutions which will\r\n\r\neliminate   the  view  that  Singapore  can  no   longer   be\r\n\r\ncompetitive as a manufacturing centre.  This could  become  a\r\n\r\npsychological barrier for potential investors.  Many a  time,\r\n\r\nI  have been asked this question by many of my customers from\r\n\r\nthe  USA and Europe.  Their perception is that Singapore  can\r\n\r\nno  longer compete in certain areas, including in the area of\r\n\r\nsemi-conductor manufacturing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, specifically for the cost of industrial land, which\r\n\r\nis an important issue, we need to match the cost of such land\r\n\r\nin  the  US  and Taiwan.  The differential land  pricing  for\r\n\r\nindustrial  land  approach could help, which  means  that  we\r\n\r\ncannot necessarily price a land at market rate.  Whilst  land\r\n\r\nprice in the context of the cost of maintaining and running a\r\n\r\ncompany  in  terms  of  its  operating  costs  may   not   be\r\n\r\nsignificant, it is a significant upfront cost which companies\r\n\r\nlook at when they decide whether to locate their factory here\r\n\r\nor in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, utility taxes and utility rates are an issue,\r\n\r\nespecially for companies which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsume  a  lot  of energy, such as petrochemical  companies,\r\n\r\nwafer  fabs  and also semi-conductor manufacturing companies.\r\n\r\nWe need to address this too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that JTC put in place a scheme\r\n\r\nto  purchase  factories from businesses and then  lease  back\r\n\r\nthese  spaces  that they have acquired back to  companies  to\r\n\r\nconduct  their businesses.  Currently, too much of  resources\r\n\r\nare  tied up by businesses in owning properties.  This scheme\r\n\r\nwill  do  a  few things.  First of all, it will minimise  the\r\n\r\ncompany's  assets which are not productive; it  will  release\r\n\r\ncash  for  growing  businesses without indebtedness  for  the\r\n\r\ncompany; and JTC should be able to lower its overall  charges\r\n\r\nby  averaging  their cost of property, thus helping  new  and\r\n\r\nexisting tenants.  JTC can continue to build upon its pool of\r\n\r\nproperties,  which  is  their core business  anyway,  in  the\r\n\r\nsituation that they acquire these spaces from companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, Singapore needs a business-friendly environment with minimum red tape to foster\r\n\r\ncreativity,  attract foreign investments  and  encourage  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  enterprises.  However, we also need to  make  our\r\n\r\nenvironment consumer-friendly.  Today, many consumers may not\r\n\r\nhave  the expertise or bargaining power to negotiate  a  fair\r\n\r\ntransaction or contract.  Although certain aspects of  unfair\r\n\r\ntrading  are dealt with under existing laws, they do not,  in\r\n\r\nmost  cases,  deal  explicitly with the  issues  of  consumer\r\n\r\nprotection.   Even  where  they do, our  consumers  lack  the\r\n\r\nknowledge and awareness of these Acts, and may not also  have\r\n\r\nthe  resources  or may find it too costly to  exercise  their\r\n\r\nlegal rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, consumers may have less information of the\r\n\r\nproducts  and services than the traders.  So the  information\r\n\r\ngap inhibits the accurate and rational decision-making.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there are limited legal remedies readily\r\n\r\navailable to consumers who wish to take action against unfair\r\n\r\ntrade   practices.   Although  some  particularly   offensive\r\n\r\npractices,  like cheating, may be covered under our  criminal\r\n\r\nlaw, many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nerrant  trading practices, such as \"switch and bait\" tactics,\r\n\r\nare not clearly covered by our existing law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for the Government to intervene to\r\n\r\npromote  a fairer and more equitable marketplace.   From  the\r\n\r\nconsumer's  perspective,  a Fair  Trading  Act  will  enhance\r\n\r\nconsumer  protection and make the playing field  more  level.\r\n\r\nIt  will  protect both traders and consumers'  interests.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to know the Ministry's assessment of the proposed\r\n\r\nFair  Trading Act, and how soon can we expect to see the Fair\r\n\r\nTrading  Act  become  a  reality in Singapore.   I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to speed up the legislative process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, this cut is on competition law,\r\n\r\nand I believe Mr Raymond Lim's EISC Committee, as part of the\r\n\r\nERC,  is  looking at this too, and I would like to  have  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  view on this.  I feel that it is  about  time  we\r\n\r\nseriously  considered the implementation of  laws  which  can\r\n\r\naddress  the  issues of unfair competition,  much  like  what\r\n\r\nexist  in  many  developed countries.  The  law  should  help\r\n\r\nensure  a  level  playing  field  between  large  and   small\r\n\r\ncompanies,  so  as  not  to  stifle  entrepreneurship.    The\r\n\r\ncompetition  law  should  be about anti-competitive  business\r\n\r\npractices,  such as abuse of market dominance and  collusion,\r\n\r\nand  not  about anti-consumer business practices,  which  are\r\n\r\nbeing  taken care of by CASE and also what Mr Yeo Guat  Kwang\r\n\r\nis suggesting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many examples of competition law exist today. So we\r\n\r\nshould  pick up the best practices from around the world  and\r\n\r\ncreate   our  own  laws  which  can  work  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nenvironment.  In the context of what many Members have talked\r\n\r\nabout,  in  terms  of GLC practices, a competition  law  will\r\n\r\naddress many of these things.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, whilst recognising the\r\n\r\nusefulness of enacting a competition law in Singapore, I have\r\n\r\nconcerns over the limitations to its efficacy imposed by  the\r\n\r\nsmallness  or size of our market.  Let me illustrate  with  a\r\n\r\nwell-known example -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noil   pump   prices.   How  can  we  detect  anti-competitive\r\n\r\nbehaviour  when the size of our market permits  instantaneous\r\n\r\nprice information transfer or discovery?  Will we, therefore,\r\n\r\nbe  spending precious time and money to investigate into this\r\n\r\nand similar situations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the larger policy level, what would be the cost of\r\n\r\nadministering   such   a  regime?   Would   anti-trust   type\r\n\r\ninvestigations  slow corporate activity down  or  stifle  the\r\n\r\ntaking of initiatives for similar companies to merge for true\r\n\r\neconomies  of  scale from which consumers can  also  benefit?\r\n\r\nMoreover, in pursuing competition as an end onto itself,  how\r\n\r\ndo  we  balance  the cost of the introduction of  competition\r\n\r\nagainst  ensuring  the existence of a competitive  framework?\r\n\r\nTake  the  case  of  the liberalisation of telecommunications\r\n\r\nactivity, where the value of telcos has been eroded not  just\r\n\r\nhere  but everywhere else, and consumer preferences  are  for\r\n\r\ncertain pricing philosophies, like calling party pays, or for\r\n\r\nmobile  phone number portability.  At which point do  we  say\r\n\r\nthat  there has been collusion amongst the various  operators\r\n\r\nnot  to allow these features?  At which point do we say that,\r\n\r\nfor  the market as a whole, it would be better not to  accede\r\n\r\nto  such preferences?  In other words, is competition  always\r\n\r\ngood for a small market like ours?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, even as we wait\r\n\r\nfor the Fair Trading Act to be made into law, many things can\r\n\r\nbe  done  concurrently to enhance the protection of  consumer\r\n\r\ninterests.  I will touch on three specific issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, consumer education. We are occasionally\r\n\r\nsurprised by the consumer's level and degree of knowledge  in\r\n\r\nproducts and business practices.  An example is the grade  of\r\n\r\npetrol, another is that of interest rates and late charges of\r\n\r\ncredit  card  companies.   In addition,  the  plight  of  the\r\n\r\nelderly consumer is another key area of concern.  CASE  hopes\r\n\r\nto work with business bodies to step up consumer education in\r\n\r\nall these areas.  Would the Ministry consider granting more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport towards consumer education programmes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, protection of customer deposits. These past\r\n\r\ncouple  of  months, we learnt about car buyers who have  paid\r\n\r\ndeposits for Skoda cars but were not able to take delivery of\r\n\r\ntheir  cars.   In February, many of us were shocked  when  we\r\n\r\nheard  of  the closure of Ken-Air and, in that instance  too,\r\n\r\nmany  customers have placed deposits for tour packages.  Last\r\n\r\nyear,  another  furniture store closed down.  Many  who  have\r\n\r\npaid for their furniture were not able to take delivery, even\r\n\r\nthough  there  was still furniture stored in  the  warehouse.\r\n\r\nThese  are  high profile cases, and there must  certainly  be\r\n\r\nmany  other  cases  which  were not reported  in  the  media.\r\n\r\nShould these cases not remind us that existing laws should be\r\n\r\namended  or  reviewed  so  as  to  give  more  protection  to\r\n\r\nconsumers?   Perhaps, the Fair Trading Act can  tackle  this,\r\n\r\nbut  should we also not consider that the customers'  deposit\r\n\r\nbe placed under a trust account?\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consumer body, CASE wants to work with businesses\r\n\r\nto  enhance  the  transparency  of  business  practices.   We\r\n\r\nbelieve  that there can be a win-win situation.  If  business\r\n\r\npractices   are   transparent,  customers'  confidence   will\r\n\r\nincrease  and  there can, in turn, be more  business.  Again,\r\n\r\ncoming  back  to the example of the petrol stations,  we  see\r\n\r\nclear  displays  of  prices at the  petrol  stations  in  US,\r\n\r\nAustralia  and  even  in Bangkok.  Such a  practice  is  long\r\n\r\noverdue  in  Singapore.   In Australia,  consumers  see  more\r\n\r\ninformation  from  the  oil  companies'  website,   including\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the international traded product price.   Again,\r\n\r\nthis is not the case in  Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we understand that the Government cannot interfere\r\n\r\nin  the  commercial decisions of the private enterprises,  we\r\n\r\nare  confident  that consumer interests can  continue  to  be\r\n\r\nprotected. Goods and service providers should be requested to\r\n\r\nprovide  detail  information of the product and  pricing,  as\r\n\r\nconsumers have the right to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir,  each  year,  CASE receives about 15,000  complaints  on\r\n\r\nconsumers   concerning  unscrupulous  and   unfair   business\r\n\r\npractices in the marketplace. Despite the presence  of  about\r\n\r\n70 consumer related legislations, consumers of all age groups\r\n\r\nand  educational background are still being conned  or  given\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  products  or services.   In  today's  complex\r\n\r\nmarketplace,  it  is sometimes difficult to  exercise  caveat\r\n\r\nemptor. Thus, consumers need more protection.  Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nseek the following clarifications from the Minister:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Are there plans to review or integrate all existing\r\n\r\nconsumer-related legislations to enhance consumer protection?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Will the Ministry consider legislating a Consumer\r\n\r\nProtection   Act  to  protect  consumers  of  \"unconscionable\r\n\r\nconduct\" of businesses?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will an enforcement agency be appointed to ensure\r\n\r\nfair trading practices in the marketplace?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, Singapore is\r\n\r\nprojecting itself as a shoppers' paradise. But often, we have\r\n\r\nstories  about it being a nightmarish experience shopping  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Tourists and other consumers claim to be  cheated\r\n\r\nin  terms  of quality of products and of huge price increases\r\n\r\nwhich  they paid for the goods.  Some claim even  to  be  put\r\n\r\nunder duress to buy goods after negotiating a price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CASE itself remains an association without any real\r\n\r\nteeth.   Many tourists from first-world countries have  often\r\n\r\nmentioned  that they find it surprising that with Singapore's\r\n\r\nsophisticated  legal system, with Singapore's reputation  for\r\n\r\nbeing  a  clean country, they do not find consumer protection\r\n\r\nto  be well-established in a country like ours.  Sir, I  find\r\n\r\nthis  unacceptable and I hope the Minister will  consider  to\r\n\r\nset up a statutory body, such as a Consumer Protection Board,\r\n\r\nwhich  should  have statutory powers and  duties  to  do  the\r\n\r\nfollowing things:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Investigate consumer complaints;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Take action against those who misrepresent or who\r\n\r\ncheat  customers, or who put customers under duress,  or  who\r\n\r\nattempt to sell goods to customers even though such goods are\r\n\r\nunsolicited;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Provide a simple dispute resolution system, backed\r\n\r\nup  with the genuine powers to sanction errant shopkeepers if\r\n\r\nthat is found to be the case;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Provide good conduct codes, both for shoppers, as\r\n\r\nwell  as for storekeepers, so that they can bargain or  trade\r\n\r\nin  a  congenial atmosphere rather than in an  atmosphere  of\r\n\r\nhostility; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) To provide a public forum for discussion of\r\n\r\nconsumer issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we really want to make Singapore a shoppers'\r\n\r\nparadise, if we really want to give a good image of Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a  clean country where trading is fair, I do support  the\r\n\r\nsuggestions  made  by  Dr Teo just now that  we  should  have\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  make  the shoppers' paradise  a  reality  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the\r\n\r\nprice   of  petrol  in  Singapore  is  a  concern  for   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   We have debated this issue  in  the  House  a\r\n\r\nnumber of times.  Now, I have read that the benchmark,  Brent\r\n\r\ncrude has gone up to just under US$29 per barrel yesterday, I\r\n\r\nthink  we  are  resigned to the fact that we can  expect  the\r\n\r\nretail pump prices to increase again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a year ago, it was discussed also in this House\r\n\r\nthat the Government would look into the possibility of having\r\n\r\n\"white  pumps\" in certain locations.  This would  bring  more\r\n\r\ncompetition to the retail petrol business.  Just a few  weeks\r\n\r\nago,  the Minister told us that the matter would have  to  be\r\n\r\ndelayed because of security concerns.  However, just a  while\r\n\r\nago, I was a bit surprised to read in today's Business Times,\r\n\r\nthis  is  an  article  that appears  on  page  22,  headlined\r\n\r\n\"Changes  Fuelling  Concerns\".  What are the  concerns?   The\r\n\r\nconcerns are from the petrol companies.

Take  the\r\n\r\nmotorcar  industry, for example.  Some years ago, we  allowed\r\n\r\nthe  parallel imports to come in and that has helped to bring\r\n\r\ndown  the prices of motorcars.  If we allow the \"white pumps\"\r\n\r\nto  be  operated,  it is a kind of parallel import  and  that\r\n\r\nshould help also to moderate the retail pump prices.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  know the Ministry's stand on this.  What  is  their\r\n\r\nreaction to the position taken by the petroleum companies?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to also make just three more points\r\n\r\nregarding  how  we  can keep petrol prices  at  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nlevel.   One of the complaints by the petroleum companies  is\r\n\r\nthe high price of sites for petrol stations.  During the good\r\n\r\ndays, when the economy was booming, some of them bid as  high\r\n\r\nas  $40  million  for a site.  I believe that  they  are  now\r\n\r\nbidding  around  $10-$15 million per  site.   Many  of  these\r\n\r\nsites,  however, were actually bid for long ago, when  prices\r\n\r\nwere much lower.  Actually, that should not be an excuse  why\r\n\r\nretail  prices should be very high.  Nevertheless, we  should\r\n\r\nperhaps re-examine again the use of the petrol station sites.\r\n\r\nThe  sites  are  now very large.  I understand  it  is  about\r\n\r\n30,000  square feet.  My question is:  why do  we  want  such\r\n\r\nlarge  locations?   Why should petrol  stations  be  used  as\r\n\r\nsupermarkets?   What is the business of petrol  companies  to\r\n\r\nsell  bread,  butter, chocolates, candies and  ice-cream?   I\r\n\r\nthink  they  should  not  be using them  to  run  convenience\r\n\r\nstores.   If  we just restrict them to selling  petroleum,  I\r\n\r\nthink they need only have half the size of what we see today.\r\n\r\nThat may be the way to bring down their cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just two more points very quickly. Sir, the other\r\n\r\nquestion is the valorem duty.  I know this is probably  under\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance, but I just want to quickly say that\r\n\r\nwhen DPM gave the answer to us yesterday, he did not tell the\r\n\r\nfull story.  He said that the tax valorem duty was 35%.   But\r\n\r\nI  think  there  is  a floor ceiling of 44 cents  on  premium\r\n\r\npetrol,  whichever is higher.  If the retail price  drops  to\r\n\r\n$1,  we would not be paying 35 cents' duty to the Government,\r\n\r\nbut  we  will still be paying 44 cents.  Perhaps there  is  a\r\n\r\ncase now to remove the floor ceiling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, the same argument again on the three-quarter tank rule. I think it is time we reviewed it again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the Cost Competitiveness\r\n\r\nCommittee,  a  few years ago, identified the  development  of\r\n\r\nSMEs  as  one  of  our  key pillars to  drive  the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy.   We, however, do not have concrete follow-up  plans\r\n\r\non  how this can be done.  The SME 21 plan has many excellent\r\n\r\nactions  and  initiatives, but what is  lacking  is  a  clear\r\n\r\nvision   and   direction,  and  there  is  no  clear   driver\r\n\r\nidentified.  We need a focused agency or statutory board, and\r\n\r\nwe can call that Enterprise Singapore, if you like, which has\r\n\r\nclear  goals, responsibility and accountability, just as  EDB\r\n\r\nhas  clear  goals and measures to track progress  of  foreign\r\n\r\ndirect  investments.  Such an agency should be given  similar\r\n\r\ngoals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that we should carve out parts of SPRING\r\n\r\nSingapore,  NSTB  or A* STAR, EDB, IE Singapore  and  form  a\r\n\r\ndedicated  one-stop support centre to help identify,  nurture\r\n\r\nand grow local companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, it is not clear which agency has the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of supporting this important  pillar  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy.   Over the years, there has been an explosion  of  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of incentive schemes and grants administered  by  too\r\n\r\nmany  Government  agencies.  Application procedures  are  too\r\n\r\ncomplex for the smaller companies, while the bigger companies\r\n\r\nhave no problem assessing these things.  We should streamline\r\n\r\nand cut down on the number of schemes and identify just one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  two  Government agencies who would administer the scheme,\r\n\r\nso  that  the  smaller companies will have no  difficulty  in\r\n\r\napplying for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is that it is also about time that we\r\n\r\nredefined  what  we  really  mean  by  \"SMEs\".   The  current\r\n\r\ndefinition  is just too broad and it is not good  in  helping\r\n\r\nidentifying  potential  winners.   I  suggest  we  categorise\r\n\r\ncompanies  into those with or without potential  growth,  and\r\n\r\nnot  just by their size.  I suggest SPRING Singapore can lead\r\n\r\nthis initiative to re-categorise our companies, so that it is\r\n\r\neasier when we talk about the various types of companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we impose MNC type rules and criteria when\r\n\r\napproving grants and incentive schemes for SMEs, it does  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily mean that SMEs will be better off operating under\r\n\r\nMNC  type  of rules. We therefore should not impose the  same\r\n\r\ncriteria  for  MNCs and SMEs when deciding on  approvals  for\r\n\r\napplication  of  some of these things.  A \"one-size-fits-all\"\r\n\r\napproach may not necessarily work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also suggest that in selecting Promising Local\r\n\r\nEnterprises, the EDB enlists the help of the private  sector,\r\n\r\nperhaps  outsource this whole activity.  As for the selection\r\n\r\ncriteria, I suggest that we re-look at them, so that  we  can\r\n\r\nhave a better chance of identifying winners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Committee of Supply discussions on the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance, I mentioned about the proposal  on  the\r\n\r\nmodification  of  the  LEFS  scheme,  where  VCs  and   angel\r\n\r\ninvestors, through a hybrid system, have access to  the  LEFS\r\n\r\nscheme.  I hope that the Minister will be able to reply as  I\r\n\r\ndid not get an answer earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to encourage mergers and acquisitions so that\r\n\r\nour companies will consolidate and strengthen themselves,  we\r\n\r\nshould  devise the appropriate tax incentives that will  spur\r\n\r\nsuch   activities.   I  believe  that  many  of  the  smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies need to group or merge together in order  for  them\r\n\r\nto effectively compete as we move forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Sir, under the present\r\n\r\neconomic climate, many larger companies, including GLCs, are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrefusing   or  delaying  payments  to  their  suppliers   and\r\n\r\ncontractors,  most  of  whom  are  small  and  medium   local\r\n\r\nenterprises.  They use various delaying techniques  and  cite\r\n\r\nall sorts of reasons, such as defects and inferior quality of\r\n\r\nthe goods sold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These small suppliers and contractors, in turn, face\r\n\r\ncash-flow problems as a result of the payments not coming  in\r\n\r\nas anticipated. They cannot afford to take legal action as it\r\n\r\ncan be expensive and long drawn.  If they complain, they risk\r\n\r\nlosing  that  customer forever.  I think there is  cause  for\r\n\r\nconcern,  as  many of these SMEs are sound and  viable  long-standing  businesses with prudent management.  But  they  are\r\n\r\nsuffering  a  credit crunch now because their  customers  are\r\n\r\ndelaying  payment.  They are not asking for  venture  capital\r\n\r\nfunding,  but would like to seek some help to tide over  this\r\n\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether any Government\r\n\r\nagency is looking into this and whether steps can be taken to\r\n\r\nalleviate  this problem faced by our SMEs, perhaps to  factor\r\n\r\ntheir receivables and grant them credit based on the invoices\r\n\r\nand purchase orders that they have in hand.\r\n\r\n<br>6.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, in our quest to focus on the top\r\n\r\nof  the  economic value chain, what measures are in place  to\r\n\r\nencourage  the SMEs to move up the value chain and reap  from\r\n\r\nour new economic strategies?  Not all SMEs can move up.  What\r\n\r\nhelp  schemes and measures are available to ensure that those\r\n\r\nwho  cannot or are simply not in the right industry can  exit\r\n\r\nwithout being discouraged from getting into business again?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve the transparency and accessibility of\r\n\r\ninformation, I would like to repeat my call during the Budget\r\n\r\ndebate.   Could  the Ministry consider the setting  up  of  a\r\n\r\ncentral  database  according to industries?   Some  of  these\r\n\r\ndatabases   could   include   the   database   of    business\r\n\r\nopportunities,  business procedures  and  business  networks.\r\n\r\nGiven that knowledge and speed are the essence of doing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  the  IT  age, this information  database  would\r\n\r\ngreatly help these SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another group of SMEs who are currently\r\n\r\nfacing  very  difficult times.  This  is  the  HDB  heartland\r\n\r\nshopowners. With the advent of mega town centres  and  hyper-marts, many of our friendly neighbourhood ket ai or provision\r\n\r\nshop uncles and aunties are now faced with a double whammy of\r\n\r\nrising  costs and falling businesses.  Even worse  are  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  purchased their shops at no discount and currently\r\n\r\nshouldering  heavy  mortgages.  For decades,  many  of  these\r\n\r\nshopowners have faithfully served the community in more  than\r\n\r\njust  the  business  way.   Could our  Government  show  some\r\n\r\ncompassion and help them stay relevant to the new economy or,\r\n\r\nas  I  have  argued earlier on, help them to exit  gracefully\r\n\r\nrather than face eviction or bankruptcy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the above, today, shopping in Singapore\r\n\r\nis  no  longer  interesting.  In fact, there is  very  little\r\n\r\ndistinction between one mall and another.  When we walk  into\r\n\r\na  mall,  we  can almost tell with one eye closed what  shops\r\n\r\nwould  come  one  after  another, be  it  G2000,  Delifrance,\r\n\r\nRobinsons,  McDonald's, and so on.  Perhaps our neighbourhood\r\n\r\ncentres can be encouraged to adopt a special shopping  theme.\r\n\r\nThis would not only help bring life and a breath of fresh air\r\n\r\ninto  the  neighbourhood centres, but also alter the shopping\r\n\r\nand  tourist  landscape  in Singapore.   Could  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider the suggestion?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> Sir, my cut is on small and medium\r\n\r\nenterprises  in the form of source of financing and  business\r\n\r\ncontinuity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Budget has provided corporate tax decreases\r\n\r\nfor businesses, the businessmen are saying, \"Well, if I don't\r\n\r\nmake  money, I don't pay tax!\"  Many of these businesses  are\r\n\r\nnot making money and, despite restructuring their finances or\r\n\r\ncutting  their costs, they are still facing a very  difficult\r\n\r\ntime.

So when suppliers\r\n\r\ngo  bust  and default, they have the creditors, and when  the\r\n\r\ndebtors  default and do not pay them, they cannot pay others,\r\n\r\nthey too will also close up.  Also, with the consolidation of\r\n\r\nthe  banks,  the  SMEs have a tough time finding  avenues  of\r\n\r\nfinances for their businesses.  Banks that have been with the\r\n\r\nSMEs since start-up, who understand their businesses and have\r\n\r\nsupported  them,  cannot support them anymore,  because  they\r\n\r\nhave merged with other banks.  Because of the constraints  on\r\n\r\nrisk classes, they cannot lend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Ministry of Trade and Industry, in its myriad of\r\n\r\nassistance programmes that groomed businesses in the  heydays\r\n\r\nwhen  the  economy was good, and helped start up  initiation,\r\n\r\nalso  consider  programmes to assist existing  and  promising\r\n\r\nSMEs  in respect of business continuity during this difficult\r\n\r\ntime?   To explore this, maybe they could work with banks  to\r\n\r\ndo  some  form of business cycle financing, in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nworking capital financing.

But\r\n\r\nI  also gather that there are some companies which use SPRING\r\n\r\nas an icon for innovation.  SPRING also, as you know, reminds\r\n\r\nus  of  new  life and a refreshing approach to  things.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  I would like to ask is that I know that SPRING,  or\r\n\r\nPSB,  has  done  quite a lot of good work in terms  of  being\r\n\r\nproductive,  creative,  innovative and  improving  standards.\r\n\r\nHow  do  they  see their role in the context of  present  day\r\n\r\nsituation?  Previously, for example, they had a job  redesign\r\n\r\nprogramme.   They  ended up with reducing  manpower  because,\r\n\r\nformerly, there was a shortage of manpower.  One good example\r\n\r\nwas  the one-man operation of buses (OMO scheme).  So we  did\r\n\r\naway  with  conductors and just have a driver  as  a  captain\r\n\r\nmanaging the whole bus.  But in the present day context, when\r\n\r\nwe  are short of jobs, how do they reconcile their role?  How\r\n\r\ndo  they  help, in fact, to save and create new  jobs  rather\r\n\r\nthan  just being productive and innovative and, in  the  end,\r\n\r\ncreating more problems for our recession?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have just one question for\r\n\r\nthe Minister and, that is, how does cost of doing business in\r\n\r\nSingapore feature in the list of priorities that the Minister\r\n\r\nhas?  How important is this in his list of priorities?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, the General Manager of a US-based\r\n\r\nretail chain that used to operate in Singapore shared with me\r\n\r\nthat it was expensive to operate in Singapore, not because of\r\n\r\nthe   high  rental  or  the  high  labour  cost,  which  were\r\n\r\nmanageable.   According to him, the prices of the merchandise\r\n\r\non  our  supermarket shelves were high because  these  prices\r\n\r\nwere  set  by the distributors.  From time to time, he  would\r\n\r\nbuy  in bulk direct from overseas and bring in himself a  few\r\n\r\ncontainer  loads of, say, tissue paper, and offer this  at  a\r\n\r\nvery  special price to the customers, and still  make  profit\r\n\r\nbecause his purchase cost was low.  But for most of the items\r\n\r\non  the shelves, he had to rely on local distributors who set\r\n\r\nthe price which could be high, as compared to the price he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  be able to pay if bought in bulk direct from overseas.\r\n\r\nBut  he  could not buy all the items he needed from  overseas\r\n\r\ndirectly  as he did not have a critical mass with just  three\r\n\r\noutlets  in Singapore.  Further, if he bought too many  items\r\n\r\non  his own, the local distributors would be upset and  would\r\n\r\nboycott him by not supplying the other things that are needed\r\n\r\nto fill the shelf space.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that the local distributors and\r\n\r\nimporters  are making huge profits by controlling the  supply\r\n\r\nand  artificially  inflating  prices.   But  could  there  be\r\n\r\ninefficiencies in the distribution chain or the system  which\r\n\r\ncould  be  reduced to bring about a reduction in prices?   Mr\r\n\r\nTan  Soo Khoon spoke about parallel importers who brought  in\r\n\r\ncars  and  this  brought down car prices on the  whole.   Can\r\n\r\nsteps  be  taken  to  encourage  parallel  imports  of  other\r\n\r\nproducts  and  to  reduce  the  cost  of  distributing  these\r\n\r\nproducts locally?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our necessities can be bought at lower prices in\r\n\r\nthe  supermarkets  across the Causeway.

It plays an important role in supporting Singapore's\r\n\r\nkey  industrial manufacturing base.  When I suggest to remake\r\n\r\nJurong,  I  am  suggesting the area from Jurong East,  Jurong\r\n\r\nCentral, Taman Jurong, Jurong West and Tuas.  After 40 years,\r\n\r\nmany  of  the industrial facilities are quite old.  The  area\r\n\r\nalso lacks recreational space and parks.  The low take-up  of\r\n\r\nHDB  housing  is  possible  proof that  people  find  it  too\r\n\r\ninconvenient  or  unpleasant  to  live  in  the  area.   Many\r\n\r\ncompanies also have to give an additional transport allowance\r\n\r\nand provide company transport in order to convince people  to\r\n\r\nwork there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how can we create a vibrant and green Jurong\r\n\r\nindustrial  estate?   I  believe it  is  the  right  time  to\r\n\r\nrecreate  Jurong  not  through a 50-year  plan,  but  a  more\r\n\r\nimmediate  and interim plan of 5-10 years.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\npropose the following for the relevant agencies, or maybe the\r\n\r\nMinistry can authorise JTC to be its coordinator to implement\r\n\r\nthis masterplan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, rebuild and revitalise all industrial\r\n\r\nfacilities.  We need Jurong industrial estate to preserve its\r\n\r\nhigh-tech  and forward-looking image to continue  to  attract\r\n\r\nkey industries to operate there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, build a new and extensive transportation\r\n\r\nnetwork into the area, like MRT, LRT, bus and taxis.  I  know\r\n\r\nthere is a task force looking into this now, but I feel  that\r\n\r\nit is taking too long, and the task force is not bold enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, construct more recreational areas and\r\n\r\nfacilities, parks, sports facilities, such as canoeing, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, develop commercial shopping area or wet market\r\n\r\nand  facilities.   We  should look at building  more  popular\r\n\r\nshopping  centres,  such  as  Jurong  Point,  in  other  town\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\nFifthly,   improve   residential  living  environment.    For\r\n\r\nexample,  many  residents tell me that the military  aircraft\r\n\r\nlanding  in their area creates a lot of noise throughout  the\r\n\r\nday.   But  I  support  this military aircraft  exercise  for\r\n\r\nsecurity reasons.

I  was  going  to  say  that\r\n\r\ncompared to Jurong, which has matured over the years, Tuas is\r\n\r\neven  worse than that.  But after hearing Mrs Yu-Foo, I  want\r\n\r\nto  share her concern and elaborate on the problems faced  by\r\n\r\nresidents and workers in Jurong as well as Tuas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what plans does JTC\r\n\r\nhave  to  improve the working environment at Tuas,  and  make\r\n\r\nTuas  a  more  attractive workplace.  I am on  the  board  of\r\n\r\ndirectors  of  a couple of companies situated in  Tuas.   Our\r\n\r\nexperience  has been that most people are reluctant  to  work\r\n\r\nthere,  even those who have been unemployed for a few months.\r\n\r\nWhen  people  call  up in response to job advertisements  and\r\n\r\nhear  that  the  company is in Tuas, they usually  give  some\r\n\r\nreasons for not wanting the job, or they simply hang  up  the\r\n\r\nphone.   There  is an urgent need to improve the  environment\r\n\r\nand  amenities at Tuas to encourage workers to join companies\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuas is inaccessible, except by private transport.\r\n\r\nTaking a taxi from Boon Lay MRT station costs more than  $10.\r\n\r\nThe  public  bus service is poor and most companies  have  to\r\n\r\nengage  their own bus service to ferry their workers  to  and\r\n\r\nfrom  the  MRT station.  This discourages overtime  work,  as\r\n\r\nonce you miss the company transport, the cost involved to get\r\n\r\nhome  is  pretty  high.  There is also a  dearth  of  banking\r\n\r\nfacilities, recreational facilities and eating houses in  the\r\n\r\narea.   The  roads  are dusty.  And why  are  palms  planted,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  rain  trees?  Palms may look  good  but  provide\r\n\r\nlittle protection from the sun, which makes the place feel as\r\n\r\nif it were 1-2 degrees hotter than the rest of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I still have some time, I would like to also\r\n\r\ntalk about eating houses in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTuas.  I understand the Ministry of Finance has a ruling that\r\n\r\nthe  maximum term of tenancy with renewal is 9 years.   After\r\n\r\nthe  limit of 9 years, the tenancy cannot be renewed but must\r\n\r\nbe opened to tender to secure the highest price.  This can be\r\n\r\nvery unfair to the first operator who moves in to set up  the\r\n\r\neating  house.  He has to take on enormous risk  by  starting\r\n\r\nthe eating house from scratch with little business initially,\r\n\r\nas  the  area  is  still under-populated.  He would  probably\r\n\r\nsuffer  losses for many years and would not be able to  break\r\n\r\neven, much less to recoup his initial capital investment.  He\r\n\r\nwatches the factories  ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could you ask your question, Mr Ong?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> I just want to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he  could look into this matter and  encourage  more\r\n\r\npeople  to take risk and contribute to build up the amenities\r\n\r\nin Tuas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
