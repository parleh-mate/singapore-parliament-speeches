That the total sum to be allocated for Head U of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore continues to face huge challenges in population issues.&nbsp; The Government has adopted three strategies to address the population problems, which are by encouraging marriage and parenthood, engaging and bonding Singaporeans overseas and attracting suitable foreigners to work and settle here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While all three are equally important, I wish to focus on the efforts made to encourage Singaporeans to marry and reproduce, as I feel this would be the most advantageous and sustainable approach for Singapore in the longer term if we do it right and creatively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, population creation remains one of the biggest challenges for our nation.&nbsp; Even with the introduction of the Baby Bonus in 2001 and several enhancements thereafter, the scheme has not produced any significant difference in raising national birth rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our total fertility rate remained a dismal 1.25 babies per resident female in 2005, way below the replacement rate of 2.1.&nbsp; This is also a decrease from the 1.4 babies per resident female in year 2001, when the Baby Bonus was introduced.&nbsp; Even the birth rate for Malays - a community which traditionally had higher birth rates&nbsp; -&nbsp; is falling below the replacement level when it declined to 2.07.&nbsp; This shows that the Baby Bonus policy, thus far, has not been that successful in encouraging procreation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this light, I would like to suggest that the Government takes a more radical and holistic approach on this matter.&nbsp; While the Baby Bonus offers many financial incentives to couples, it is apparent that money, though important, is not necessarily the only deciding factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With more women in the workforce, many feel that the burden falls on them when they have children.&nbsp; I would like to suggest that the Government allows the flexibility for men to take longer paternity leave and also share the responsibilities of having children.&nbsp; Such a move has led to an increase in birth rates for Iceland, where fathers can have up to three months' paternity leave on 80% of their salaries.&nbsp; I am not suggesting that we fully embrace the Iceland model as this will dramatically increase business cost, but the idea is to consider and allow greater flexibility at the workplace for men to shoulder greater responsibility in tending to growing family needs.&nbsp; This will, hopefully, help women who worry that having more children means sacrificing their career development when they have to take maternity or longer leave to look after the new additions to the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to urge the Government to involve more sectors in the drive to promote having children.&nbsp; In the past, the predominant religion of a country was a big factor in determining high birth rates.&nbsp; So far, barring a few family related organisations, the drive to spread the message on having babies has largely been done by the Government.&nbsp; As societies world wide become more religious, the Government should adopt a more integrated approach and consider working with the religious sector to encourage more Singaporeans to have babies, as it is in the interest of everyone to sustain the existence of a future generation of Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the number of marriages in 2005 saw a slight increase but much more can and should be done.&nbsp; With the announcement that the Social Development Unit's role as cupid coming to an end, this leaves the task of match-making largely in the hands of the private sector.&nbsp; This is a good move as it destigmatises match-making from being something that is initiated and led by the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will also spur private companies to become more innovative in getting singles together.&nbsp; SDU's new role in accrediting these programmes and providing funds will turn match-making into an exciting industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Sir, I am worried that SDU's withdrawal from playing cupid may mean an end to affordable match-making services.&nbsp; It used to cost only $50 a year for premium membership in SDU which included targeted match-making, but private companies now are charging hundreds of dollars for services and some even thousands of dollars for 12 dates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While price is dictated by market forces, I would like to urge SDU to keep check to ensure agencies do not over-charge customers.&nbsp; There should also be a wide range of services at different prices to cater to the population at large so that it can be accessible for singles who do not want to spend thousands of dollars to meet Mr or Miss Right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, reverting back to the Baby Bonus scheme which was implemented in 2001, I would advocate that a comprehensive survey is quite overdue to measure the effectiveness of these efforts so that we can plug the gaps. I believe one area is sorely lacking, and that is an approach in raising awareness of these issues amongst our youths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that more focus should be given to educating them, especially those at tertiary levels, on marriage, procreation and related responsibilities.&nbsp; The intention is not to preach or get them to marry at a young age but to raise their awareness on the need to balance career ambitions, economic goals and marriage or having a family, and the impact it can have on the country should more and more people put off marriage or having children.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Developing and Managing Talent</em>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, for a small city state that has embraced globalisation, the development and management of talent must be a top priority.&nbsp; So I am very encouraged that this important area is receiving attention at the highest level&nbsp; -&nbsp; the Prime Minister's Office.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I draw parallels with the commercial world, this is in line with the best practice in the world's leading corporations where the CEO's office typically takes charge of attracting, retaining and developing talent.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully support the two-pronged approach we are taking to ensure that we have an adequate talent pool to support our economic ambitions.&nbsp; Firstly, our educational infrastructure at every level is continually being improved so that we impart the right skill sets to every Singaporean in order to develop them to their highest potential.&nbsp; We are also reaching out to Singaporeans living and working overseas through the Overseas Singapore Unit.&nbsp; The objective being to keep our citizens abroad abreast of developments and opportunities back home.&nbsp; As a result, hopefully, some of these well-qualified Singaporeans will return home while others will be informed ambassadors of Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, with our falling birth rate and because increasingly value creation in our sophisticated economy is based on intangibles such as knowledge, ideas and innovation, we have to look to immigration to boost our population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government's policy to substantially increase Singapore's population is supported by research which indicates that by almost any measure, the larger a city's population, the greater the innovation and wealth creation per person.&nbsp; These research findings are the subject of an article in this month's <I>Harvard Business Review</I> by Geoffrey B. West of the Santa Fe Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this research suggests that as Singapore's population increases, we can expect a more than proportionate increase in economic and creative output measured by such criteria as patent activity, number of super creative people, wages and GDP per capita.&nbsp; This is good news, particularly as Singapore's infrastructure can comfortably support a much larger population than the present 4.5 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as we open our doors to new migrants, we must manage the sentiments of some Singaporeans, who feel that the influx of foreigners will threaten their jobs and career opportunities.&nbsp; It is important that we calm such emotional responses by reassuring our citizens that incoming foreign talent, in most cases, will not be competing with them for jobs.&nbsp; In fact, new migrants help to fill important gaps in the workforce and even create new jobs for Singaporeans by attracting new types of industries and businesses to Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we have to face the fact that there is a segment of our population whose jobs are most at risk.&nbsp; They are the lower-skilled and lower-wage workers.&nbsp; But they face competition for their jobs not from fellow Singaporeans or new immigrants but from workers in low-cost offshore centres.&nbsp; Technology, better communication and the development of new business models has meant that their jobs are capable of being shifted to the country with the lowest wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has responded to this problem not by cutting down immigration but by assisting this group of workers by introducing measures such as Workfare and providing generous training opportunities to upgrade skills.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Loo Choon Yong (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof Richard Florida in the&nbsp;<I>Flight of the Creative Class</I> talked about three things&nbsp; -&nbsp; 3Ts&nbsp; -&nbsp; technology, talent and tolerance.&nbsp; Well, America has benefited from successive waves of immigration&nbsp;in the last 100 years, from Europe, Latin America and Asia, and that is why they have Wall Street, Silicon Valley and also Route 128, and have prospered.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore will need to attract more creative individuals from all over the world.&nbsp; Otherwise, we will not be able to grow.&nbsp; But we hear of disturbing trends developing in Singapore&nbsp; -&nbsp; landlords slamming their doors on foreigners when they try to rent their flat.&nbsp; We know of mothers who complain about bright PRC students competing against their children for academic prizes in schools.&nbsp; We even hear of professionals complaining about foreign talents taking over their jobs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am concerned that all these tendencies are appearing even when we have growth of 7.9% and a tight labour market.&nbsp; We wonder what will happen if there is an economic downturn&nbsp; -&nbsp; the scene may get ugly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us came from migrant stock&nbsp; -&nbsp; from China, India and the Malay Archipelago.&nbsp; Let us remind ourselves that it was not too long ago that signs outside Singapore Cricket Club said, \"No dogs, no Chinese allowed\".&nbsp; And it was not too long ago when we were regarded as second class citizens in our own country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, to be a first-world economy, we need a first-world mindset and matching habits.&nbsp; The tolerance in cities like New York, London, Paris and&nbsp;Boston helps welcome foreigners, and that is why they are vibrant, diverse and that is why they thrive.&nbsp; We must do the same.&nbsp; Let us not forget that this is a multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-lingual society, and inter-racial harmony and&nbsp;inter-religious tolerance will move us forward.&nbsp; We must not forget that.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Foreign Talents</em>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</B> Sir, in view of the unfavourable demographic shift of an ageing population, immigration can help to slow down the process of ageing and the shrinking of the population and mitigate the negative economic impact.&nbsp;

While I understand the need for a bigger population, the ground reactions have been a little unsettling as Singaporeans are now seeing many of these people in their neighbourhoods.&nbsp; The recent survey reported in the <I>Straits Times</I> about how Singaporeans perceive the Chinese from China, which was mainly negative, is an example of the reactions from Singaporeans.&nbsp; Similarly, the new Indians are better educated and wealthier and are keeping among themselves and Singaporean Indians by birth feel a bit threatened.&nbsp; We have yet to successfully integrate the new Singaporeans into the Singapore society.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue of massage parlours which popped up in our HDB neighbourhoods, employing study <I>mamas</I> and also those who are here on study passes are social issues that we have to grapple with.&nbsp; Many Singaporean middle-aged and older men are getting into trouble with these foreigners.&nbsp; These foreigners know of a famous number - 5562 - these are the two CPF withdrawal ages.&nbsp; Some men are losing money which they freshly withdrew from the CPF to some of these foreigners, and this is happening in our neighbourhoods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what worries me most is the issue of racial integration.&nbsp; While in Singapore we have put in a lot of effort since independence to ensure racial and religious harmony becomes the bedrock of the Singapore society, I am not sure the new immigrants will immediately come on board on this.&nbsp; Particularly those coming from China where the society is almost homogeneous, I do not think we can expect them to immediately understand and appreciate the other races in Singapore.&nbsp; Similarly, those coming from India may have a history of religious conflicts and may view people of other races and religions differently from the way the various races and religious groups in Singapore look at each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

With the present total fertility rate of 1.25 and our Government's efforts in attracting global talent to Singapore, we would expect the majority of the additional two million citizens to be migrants from various countries.&nbsp; I presume that these new citizens will be professionals or specialists of different talent from different ethnicities and cultures.&nbsp; These new citizens will be adults who have lived in different political systems and experienced different sets of country governance.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a multi-racial and multi-religious country, Singapore is constantly faced with the challenge of bonding our people.&nbsp; We are still developing a sense of belonging and identity among our people.&nbsp; We need to do more to develop a sense of pride among Singaporeans so that our people can carry our flags high to be a top First World nation.&nbsp; Therefore, integrating new citizens of different backgrounds into our multi-racial and multi-religious society will pose immense challenges to the Government and its people in the future.&nbsp; This would also have to take into consideration the political, economic and social aspects of citizenship integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, politically, I wish to&nbsp;find out from our Prime Minister whether the Government has plans to help new citizens and also new migrants and PRs who could be our future citizens, understand our political system.&nbsp; We need to ensure that these new citizens understand our Government's policies and will support the Government to take Singapore to new heights.&nbsp; The key question is whether these new citizens will support and vote for a strong and stable government with little or no opposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economically, it is easier for these new citizens to fit into our economy as many would be able to secure good paying jobs.&nbsp; The challenge will be whether they will pose intense competition to other Singaporeans in competing for good jobs. This may result in unhappiness among Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Socially, it would require many hours of community engagement before these new citizens can gain acceptance by&nbsp;residents in our society.&nbsp; This is particularly so in the HDB heartlands as many of our residents may not understand the cultures of these new citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, community bonding is a complex task.&nbsp; In a fast-paced and cosmopolitan society like Singapore, bonding will need a more structured approach to achieve success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to ask the Prime Minister the following questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; What policies and measures are in place to bond the 6.5 million Singaporeans?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; What are the plans to integrate new citizens into our community?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; How can we further strengthen the family and community ties among Singaporeans?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>New Citizens and Permanent Residents</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</B> Sir, I wish to speak on the topic of integration of new citizens and PRs.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Mr Inderjit Singh, I have noted in feedback with the Indian community that Singapore Indians are concerned about the Indians from elsewhere who either work here or are new citizens and PRs.&nbsp; There is concern that they do not mix with the local Indians and they stay apart and, in some cases, consider themselves superior to the local Indians.&nbsp; I wondered whether this was something that was peculiar to the Indian community.&nbsp; But on asking around, I understood that the Chinese community also felt the same way.&nbsp; And this highlights an important issue -&nbsp;the need for integration and the potential faultlines within the ethnic communities.&nbsp; Rather than cover up the issue, it is best that we address it openly and transparently and with sensitivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that we must go back to the basics, which is this: what does it mean to be Singaporean?&nbsp; The late Mr S Rajaratnam put it best - being Singaporean is not a matter of birth or race; it is an act of will.&nbsp; And that is the reason why we say the pledge because it is a conscious act of pledging yourself to be Singaporean.&nbsp; When you say the pledge, you commit to being a Singaporean, meaning you commit to be one united people; you commit to do this irrespective of your race,&nbsp;religion or&nbsp;ethnic background.&nbsp; Both current Singaporeans and new citizens and PRs must understand what this means in the context of being Singaporeans today and trying to grow our population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans, we must remember that we must always be an open society, welcoming visitors and welcoming those who want to be more than visitors, who want to stay here and become part of us.&nbsp; We must never become a closed, ossified, stratified society - because that is the surest way to decline.&nbsp; Singapore, when founded by Sir Stamford Raffles, was founded as&nbsp; a free port, a crossroad of the trade routes between Europe, India and China. Singapore was a place where people all over the then civilised world could come to trade, to do business and, in some cases, to stay.&nbsp; Our strength is in our openness and diversity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For new citizens and PRs, it is important to remember that once you become one of us, citizen or PR, you embark on the great enterprise of being a Singaporean.&nbsp; When you become a new citizen, our vision becomes your vision, our hopes become your hopes, and our dreams become your dreams.&nbsp; You will also contribute to that vision, those hopes and dreams by contributing your ideas,&nbsp;talent and&nbsp;energy.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a journey to make, a destination to reach, and we have to do it together.&nbsp; And to do this, the need for integration is extremely important.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would, therefore, like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps and initiatives can be taken to facilitate greater integration between Singaporeans, new citizens and PRs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Citizenship and National Pride</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Sir, for a 17-year-old teenager born into a population of 2.7 million in 1990, he would be one in 6.5 million people by age 35.&nbsp; Rapid population increase via the influx of immigrants can stress our social fabric.&nbsp; Can a young Singaporean cope in boom and bane cycles?&nbsp; Recent <I>Straits Times</I> surveys revealed some xenophobic reactions and a lack of national pride.&nbsp; With a highly demanded Singaporean workforce, Singapore must develop itself into an attractive home, not a hotel or revolving door for talents, lest we&nbsp;lose our own talents to overseas.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; What steps can we take to foster trust and empower our own citizens, making sure that citizenship has its privileges?&nbsp; Imported solutions - talents, SMEs, MNCs and even NGOs are fast and easier solutions, but nurturing and empowering local talents would signal a new social compact and foster national pride.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; How can we expedite efforts to communicate, collaborate and nurture local entities so that our people, including new citizens, know that the Government is a compassionate one that radiates care and partnership?

Many Singaporeans have also given suggestions on how to deal with our population challenge. I am very encouraged by the responses and the personal interest they have taken in facing this challenge together with us.\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me explain by putting the population challenge in the proper perspective.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad said that we face a huge challenge in population issues. And Mr Gautam Banerjee and Dr Loo Choon Yong talked specifically about the need to attract and manage the right talents to come and sink roots in Singapore. Indeed, attracting the right talent into Singapore is an important part of our population strategy.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have developed our economy rapidly, and very successfully, in the past 40 years. Now, we have to scale new heights and multiple peaks; to keep our economy growing, to create more jobs and to provide a better life for Singaporeans.&nbsp; The only way for this to happen, and that is the only way to happen, is to ensure that we have continued economic growth. There is no other way.&nbsp; To do this, we need a critical mass of able and willing Singaporeans, able to adapt and meet the changing needs of the global economy; and willing to do what is needed to ensure a better life for themselves, their children and fellow citizens.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans are indeed able and willing. But, there is just one problem - there are not enough of us and our population is fast ageing. We have not been able to replace ourselves through local births since 1976 - 31 years ago. Even assuming current immigration trends with an average of 8,000 new citizens a year between the years 2001 and 2005, the number of deaths each year could outstrip births by as early as 2030.&nbsp; In fact, if we do not have an inflow of new immigrants, our population will start to decline even earlier, by 2020.&nbsp; Japan started to have its population decline in 2005. This is why we have decided that encouraging immigration has to be a key strategy in tackling our population challenge.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, we are now in what I call a \"BBC\" world.&nbsp; What is \"BBC\"? One that is \"Boundless, Borderless and Competitive\". There will be \"Boundless\" opportunities for many in an increasingly \"Borderless\" world; at the same time, the stakes are much higher and a lot more \"Competitive\". Many countries are trying hard to attract people to sink roots in their country. Why? The answer is very simple - immigrants have helped many economies grow beyond their inherent potential.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States, for example, attracted waves of immigrants since the 17th century. Europeans, Africans, Latin Americans and, in the last few decades, Asians - they have all come to call the US home over the years. What have they brought to the US? First, more jobs - a Pew report found that in most states in the United States where immigration levels were high, employment prospects were above national average. Second, a stronger economy - back in 1997, the National Academy of Science had already concluded in its report for the United States Congress that immigration had brought a net benefit of $10 billion to the US economy. Third, more births - the United States Centre for Immigration Studies estimated that 23% of all babies born in the US in 2002 had a foreign-born mother.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second example, Australia.&nbsp; Australia's net overseas immigration has accounted for more than 45% of its population growth since 1998. In 2005, 24% of Australians were born overseas. Yet in the same year, it embarked on its biggest recruitment drive for skilled workers, like hairdressers, mechanics, pharmacists and accountants, in more than 40 cities worldwide, including Chennai, Seoul, Manila, Bangkok and, of course, Singapore - targeting not only our university and polytechnic graduates, but also our ITE graduates.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does this mean for Singapore, or more to the point, can we afford to close our doors to immigrants? People are our key and only resource. Let me put it bluntly this way - we need all the talents we can get, be they locals or immigrants. We are not producing enough babies; we do not produce enough engineers, bankers, technicians, artists and even chefs of our own.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who gets to benefit at the end of it? Locals. Look at our wafer fabrication industry. As of 2005, there were 15,000 positions in this industry - 8,000 operators and 7,000 engineers. Singaporeans and PRs could only fill 80% of the higher-skilled engineer positions and one-third of the operator positions. If we did not have enough qualified engineers and operators here, these wafer fabs would have located elsewhere long ago.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus far, the outcome of our open-door policy to support and stimulate economic growth has been positive. Many Singaporeans have benefited from this. In 2006, a record of more than 170,000 jobs was created. Locals took up more than half of them. With the upcoming IRs, we can expect more job opportunities in the services sector, such as tourism and entertainment, finance and hospitality. In the maritime sector, the labour shortage is so acute that Keppel Corp - Keppel Corp is our largest maritime ship repairing and servicing company - had to tie up with MediaCorp to profile this industry in a local TV serial, just to show Singaporeans what shipyard workers do. There are jobs available - but we must have the critical mass of able and willing people. Where we lack local manpower, we have to bring in immigrants. Even if we do not bring them in, they can and will still compete against us from their home countries.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I empathise with the Singaporeans who have lost their jobs to foreigners or who cannot find a job. Our economy today is different from that of 10 years ago. Some Singaporeans found it difficult to compete or adjust. Their concerns and frustrations are completely understandable. But they are not forgotten. Although the Government cannot insulate them from competition, we will do our best to mitigate their problems. They must skill up and keep up. The Ministry of Manpower has facilitated various skills upgrading and training programmes. Some of my residents faced problems finding jobs too and when they came to see me at MPS, I advised them to go and upgrade and do something else. Those who heeded the advice were appreciative.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are those who say that Singapore is constrained by our physical space; we are after all just a \"little red dot\". Can we cater to a larger population size of 6.5 million, for example? This was a question posed by many in the last few days. In early February, MND announced a planning parameter of 6.5 million people for its new Concept Plan. In order to accommodate 6.5 million people some time in the future, we need to make our plans now.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me emphasise that 6.5 million population is not a target. Since MND had released its planning parameter, many Singaporeans have assumed that the Government has set a 6.5 million target population size going forward. This interpretation is incorrect. Instead, it is an assurance from our town planners that we remain two, three steps ahead of the game - if our population grows, because we start producing more babies or because we are successful in attracting more immigrants to come here and set up their home, we will be ready. While our population growth will continue to be fuelled by both local births and immigrants, it is unlikely that we will suddenly face an influx of foreigners into Singapore. Even as we welcome more foreigners or immigrants, the Government will monitor our population growth closely to ensure that the quality of life and well-being of Singaporeans will not be compromised.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many also asked how many immigrants should Singapore bring in. I think the more pertinent question is: how many immigrants can Singapore attract? My bigger concern now is that we are not even replacing ourselves and we need to prevent our population from ageing rapidly and shrinking quickly. We now have a window of opportunity to attract immigrants who can contribute to Singapore. We had a good run of economic growth in the last three years. We are well-positioned to ride on this momentum to create an even more positive and exciting future. But we cannot just sit back and expect that new immigrants or foreigners will automatically come, work and settle in Singapore if we do not make an effort to attract them.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just about 10 days ago, on 21st February, I hosted a lunch for a group of about 20 Chairmen and CEOs in our companies. One of them told me that it was now increasingly difficult to attract middle-level managers coming into Singapore from India and China. Why? Because many of them now believe that their own countries would offer them better long-term prospects. The ones who are at very top positions will want to come because the pay is very good; and the ones who have just freshly graduated or those with a few years of working experience will come because they can get international exposure. The ones at the middle-level feel that their future can be made in their own country. So, it is not a given that we can attract good people to come here.&nbsp; We must try our level best.&nbsp; We have to be open and welcoming.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not share the view of those who fear that immigrants are going to overwhelm us. I fear that the foreigners will instead bypass us and go to other more attractive countries.&nbsp; There are plenty of them also competing for talents - United States, Australia, even Europe and China, and you will be surprised that while China has a big population, many are unemployed and they still want foreign talents.&nbsp; We are only a small country.&nbsp; We are competing against the big players. So we have to do what we need to do to attract them here.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we care about the quality of immigrants? Of course, that must be so. We do not want to bring in any Tom, Dick or Harry who says, \"I want to work in Singapore and live here and bring up my family.\"&nbsp; To do so indiscriminately will simply do ourselves disservice.&nbsp; We have to be selective and choose what kind of people would settle here and contribute.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do we need?&nbsp; We need people with the relevant skills, experience and know-how to come to Singapore. We do not need all of them to&nbsp;have PhDs or Masters degrees. They can be specialists like aircraft technicians, or have other skills that will add value to our economy. That is why we have broadened our eligibility criteria to attract more skilled immigrants to sink roots in Singapore.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to move beyond simply attracting talent to retaining talent. It is not just bringing them here. It is keeping them here so that they will stay here, marry here, bring up the family here, and eventually sink roots here.&nbsp; I think you know Steven Spielberg, creator of ET and countless well-known Hollywood movies and classics - his parents were Hungarian immigrants in the US. All over the world, immigrant talents have in turn contributed significantly to the community that first welcomed them to stay. This is also true for Singapore. For example, we have Mr Wong Ngit Liong.&nbsp; I think you may have heard his name, if not, you will have heard his company.&nbsp; He is the Chairman and CEO of Venture Group. Venture Group employs about 13,000 staff and has operations throughout Asia, America and Europe.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Singapore alone, Venture employs some 2,300 staff.&nbsp; We have an example in this Chamber - Mr Gautam Banerjee, who came here many years ago. We also have Mr Harish Nim from Emerio Corporation, an IT services company employing 1,000 people, with a strong presence in the Asia Pacific and Europe.&nbsp; For some, it is not just about the economic value that they bring to Singapore, but also the culture and tradition.&nbsp; If you are a carpet lover, you may have heard of Hassan's Carpets, one of the oldest carpet shops in Singapore, set up in the 1930s and it is now run by the third generation in the family - Mr Suliman Hamid, the grandson of the founder.&nbsp; When asked why he took up Singapore citizenship, Suliman's, who was born in Pakistan, immediate response was that \"This is home!\"&nbsp; Immigrants, such as Wong Ngit Liong, Harish Nim and Suliman Hamid, have made Singapore their home, and added much to Singapore.&nbsp; We must welcome more of them to come here.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.45 pm<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo also asked about the progress of attracting immigrants to Singapore.&nbsp; We have done well so far in the last few years.&nbsp; In 2006, about 13,200 new Singapore citizens and 57,300 PRs were granted citizenship.&nbsp; We must continue to attract the right people to join our team.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have taken steps to pro-actively reach out to potential PRs and Singapore citizens.&nbsp; ICA recently launched an online self-assessment eligibility test.&nbsp; We call it the Naturalisation Eligibility Tool for interested PR and Singapore citizenship applicants.&nbsp; Information packages to promote naturalisation will follow in the middle of the year.&nbsp; Using the Naturalisation Eligibility Tool, anyone, whether in Singapore or overseas, can answer questions according to the questionnaire in the Tool and assess their chances of being considered to be eligible to apply for PR and citizenship.&nbsp; We are making it easier for those who are outside also because, for those already here, we have plenty of time and there are opportunities to publicise it to them.&nbsp; We also want those who are outside to be able to do this.&nbsp; If they choose to come here, what are their chances?&nbsp; They can also assess what are the chances of being accepted as a PR and as a citizen.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICA has also been sending personal invitation letters to suitable working adults to apply for PR and citizenship since 1994.&nbsp; We also have grassroots leaders who actively encourage those who are interested to take up PR and citizenship by welcoming them to the neighbourhood and sharing relevant experiences with them.&nbsp; Here, I want to thank Mr Banerjee for his suggestion of formal channels for potential citizens and PRs to provide feedback and inputs to the Government.&nbsp; Indeed, this is important, because we value feedback from all Singaporeans, and there are many channels now, eg, REACH, chaired by Dr Amy Khor, and there are many other avenues for anyone, including our new citizens and PRs, to provide feedback or seek information.&nbsp; And if there are other better ideas to do this, I will consider them.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now talk about the need for Singaporeans to welcome immigrants and for immigrants to integrate into our society.&nbsp; This is an important subject.&nbsp; It has received extensive publicity in the press, particularly after the <I>Straits Times'</I> survey that led to all kinds of remarks being made about foreigners and surfaced all kinds of prejudices and stereotyping among Singapore citizens and foreigners.&nbsp; I want to talk a bit about this.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is a multi-racial country.&nbsp; To maintain this harmony, all of us must learn how to accommodate and adapt.&nbsp; So the concerns shared by Ms Indranee Rajah, Mr Inderjit Singh, Dr Teo Ho Pin and several other Members are taken in.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>Sunday Times'</I> survey published on 14th January 2007 on Singaporeans' attitudes towards foreigners revealed that Singaporeans do not mind foreigners coming here to work.&nbsp; But some continue to harbour certain prejudices against them, while some foreigners have also not adapted to our local conditions and norms.&nbsp; I have heard and read of accounts of how some Singaporean landlords refused to lease their properties to some foreigners.&nbsp; Ms Sandhya Reddy related her unhappy experience in the <I>Today</I> newspaper on 31st January 2007 that a landlord refused to rent her the flat because she was an Indian immigrant.&nbsp; There was also a case of a new immigrant who moved into a private estate and held a housewarming party with loud music late into the&nbsp;night, not a weekend.&nbsp; Of course, the neighbours were disturbed and understandably upset.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were also instances of stereotyping and social prejudices of foreigners against Singaporeans.&nbsp; It happens the other way round too.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was told of a road rage incident where a Caucasian, who drove into a yellow box junction and blocked the path of other motorists, started swearing in an exaggerated Singlish accent, only to be retorted by an equally vocal Singaporean who spoke in an equally exaggerated foreign accent.&nbsp; Of course, we can all laugh at such stories and frown at all these behaviours, but we should not condone them, whether it is about prejudices against renting properties to somebody not of your race or of somebody else's behaviour that you do not like, such as the <I>Straits Times'</I> survey talking about Chinese being too loud, noisy and dirty.&nbsp; I think they forgot what our own forefathers were like.&nbsp; It just goes to show that both sides need to make the right effort to build a shared community that we can call our very own.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the issue of integration, ie, of welcoming new immigrants and of them adapting to our local environment, is not something unique to Singapore.&nbsp; Yet, as a former immigrant and now a multi-racial society, we should be able to adapt, accommodate and handle such relationship issues and have a higher level of understanding and tolerance for this.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we look back into history, when our parents, grandparents, great grandparents first came here from wherever, eg, India, China, Indonesia, the Philippines or anywhere around the region, they were all here to&nbsp; make a living, and seek economic opportunities, and they wished one day they would go home, retire and die there.&nbsp; Members must have heard of your mother, grandmother, etc, who would tell you the same stories.&nbsp; But in the end, many chose to remain in Singapore and make this their home.&nbsp; That is why we are here.&nbsp; If they had been dissuaded from sinking roots in Singapore because of some remarks or unwelcoming gestures by the locals at that time, I think Singapore would not be what it is today.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So acceptance, tolerance and integration take time and effort, and we must all make the effort.&nbsp; But we also do not have to pretend that there are no differences between new immigrants and the native Singaporeans.&nbsp; It happens everywhere too.&nbsp; Such differences existed even during the times of our forefathers when they were immigrants.&nbsp; They, too, found it hard to integrate into the local community.&nbsp; So what did they do?&nbsp; They formed clan associations and mutual help associations, etc.&nbsp; But, over time, they and their children integrated.&nbsp; We should acknowledge that there are differences between Singaporeans and the new immigrants.&nbsp; We may speak different languages.&nbsp; But one thing will hold us together, ie, our common destiny as Singaporeans, new or native.&nbsp; It is not an easy decision for someone to come here, sink roots here and choose to make this his permanent home.&nbsp; We must support and encourage them.&nbsp; In that way, we will accelerate their integration into our community and, soon, the differences that seemed so stark before, would diminish.&nbsp; This is especially so for the children and grandchildren of immigrants here, as they would have grown up in the Singaporean milieu.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government, therefore, takes the issue of integration seriously and recognises that more efforts are needed to focus in this area.&nbsp; And there are many ongoing efforts already.&nbsp; The People's Association, for example, has, through its grassroots network and leaders, organised many activities at the community level to facilitate integration between locals and new citizens.&nbsp; Marine Parade GRC, for example, has a sub-committee to reach out to new citizens by organising gatherings for them and sharing information.&nbsp; There are also expatriate clubs and communities that will cater to the expatriate community, eg, the Kowloon Club, Hua Yuan, India Club and many other associations formed by the Indian immigrant community.&nbsp; The MOE also plans to enhance the integration of foreign students with Singaporeans.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To encourage all Singaporeans, whether they are newly-minted citizens or indigenous citizens, to embrace our common identity as one community, we are studying the possibility of having a \"Citizenship Day\", like what the Australians have.&nbsp; Miss Penny Low raised the issue of citizenship and national pride.&nbsp; A \"Citizenship Day\" will mark and celebrate our coming together as citizens of Singapore.&nbsp; MCYS will drive this effort as part of its mandate to build a cohesive and resilient society.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Citizens, of course, will be valued more than foreigners.&nbsp; Miss Penny Low also asked about the value of being a citizen.&nbsp; Singaporeans can rest assured that they would always come first.&nbsp; In fact, in all our policies, they are targeted at improving the lives of our citizens.&nbsp; We have recently reduced healthcare and education subsidies granted to foreigners and PRs to ensure that citizens enjoy the fullest support from the Government.&nbsp; We have many Government surplus sharing schemes, eg, CPF top-ups, New Singapore Shares, Economic Restructuring Shares, and now even Workfare.&nbsp; They favour only citizens.&nbsp; But let us also remember that the value of citizenship cannot be measured in dollars and cents.&nbsp; Singapore is our home; it is what we have to call our own.&nbsp; We cannot put a price on the feeling of being in a place that belongs to us, where we belong.&nbsp; Home, as it is often said, is where the heart is.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We care for Singaporeans who are overseas too.&nbsp; Some of our best and brightest Singaporeans are similarly attracted to study and work abroad.&nbsp; Some even migrated.&nbsp; It is not necessarily a bad thing that Singaporeans go overseas to work and study.&nbsp; One day, they will come back.&nbsp; And when they come back, they will add value to Singapore.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low asked how the Government intends to strengthen its ties with these overseas Singaporeans.&nbsp; She mentioned the Overseas Singaporean portal.&nbsp; We have an Overseas Singaporean Unit too, specifically just targeted at engaging</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The Government will do its best to engage Singaporeans&nbsp;while they are overseas.&nbsp; While they are there too, they should do something for themselves and take the initiative to organise things for themselves, to reach out to others.&nbsp; They cannot wait for the Government to do everything.&nbsp; I have been to many cities and met many Singaporeans. Those who are active indeed found many ways of making sure that the Singaporeans who are there found ways to engage with one another. And that is a good sign.&nbsp; Some even do social service.&nbsp; I know, for example, one of them raised money to provide bursary and so on to children in that country.&nbsp; And in a way, they become our ambassadors.&nbsp; While we want our embassies to do more, we must also bear in mind that every embassy has very few officials and Singaporeans themselves have to work hard and engage themselves and publicise what they do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n1.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mdm Halimah Yacob asked for an update on the measures to promote marriage and parenthood in Singapore and Dr Ahmad Magad also urged the Government to do more to boost the birth of more Singaporean children. Let me now touch on this other key strategy on our population challenge. I would ask the Clerk to give out some data on what the Government has done so far with regard to the population package.&nbsp; [<I>Copies of handouts* distributed to hon.

The take-up for the various schemes has been encouraging.&nbsp; The table that I just circulated contains all the details.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Baby Bonus scheme was introduced in April 2001, the Government has disbursed $420 million to the parents of 133,000 newborns, and co-funded 89,000 co-savings accounts that were opened, which amounted to another $270 million. And that is a lot of money.&nbsp; Since Government-paid maternity leave was extended from eight to 12 weeks in August 2004, 28,000 mothers have benefited from it.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the year of assessment 2006, 46,000 parents have claimed $70 million under the Parenthood Tax Rebate; 131,000 mothers have claimed Working Mothers' Child Relief amounting to $111 million in forgone revenue; and 26,000 parents have claimed Grandparent Caregiver Relief amounting to $4 million in forgone revenue.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Started in August 2004, the Work-life Works! or the WoW! Fund of $10 million is expected to be fully committed by the middle of this year. The Government will study how to encourage the companies to create more work-life balance in the workplace.&nbsp; The Manpower Minister will give Members more details on this.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, there have been some positive indications in birth figures.&nbsp; Although we have not increased our total fertility rate (TFR) from 1.25 to something higher, at least, we have arrested the decline that we have seen just before 2004.&nbsp; In 2005, 35,500 babies were born - 400 more than in 2004. In 2006, 36,200 babies were registered&nbsp; - 570 more than in 2005.&nbsp; A survey by MCYS also showed some encouraging signs: 56% of married persons indicated that they would consider having more children earlier and 83% indicated that the package has helped to make Singapore a more family-friendly place.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, we still have very worrying trends.&nbsp; What are these?&nbsp; First, more Singaporeans are now remaining single:&nbsp; 37.4% of male citizens in the key age group of 30-34 were single in 2005, and that was an increase of 33.9% in 1990.&nbsp; The same figure for females was 26.3%, up from 20.9%.&nbsp; 22.2% of male citizens in the age group of 35-39 were single in 2005, up from 17.8% in 1990; that for females was 17.2%, up from 14.7%. In other words, more males than females remain single, and the worrying trend is that more are remaining single in the age group band of 30-39.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, Singaporeans are marrying later:&nbsp; the median age of citizen males getting married was about 30 in 2005, up from 28 in 1990; that for females was close to 27, up from 25 in 1990.&nbsp; Singaporeans are having their first child later.&nbsp; The median age of a Singaporean mother at first birth had also increased from 27.5 years in 1990 to 29 in 2005.&nbsp; Singaporeans are also having fewer babies.&nbsp; On average, a married Singaporean woman had 2.2 children in 2005, down from 2.8 in 1990. While it is still above the replacement level of 2.1, it is clearly on a downward trend.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among ever-married female Singaporeans aged 40-49 years, 6.6% of them were childless in 2005, and that is up from 4.4% in 1990. So having to juggle work and family life, and the cost of raising a child, remain the key considerations for many in deciding whether to have children.&nbsp; From the data, it seems that a typical Singaporean has a high probability of staying single, and if he or she does get married, is getting married later, and will have his/her first child at a later age and have fewer children.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Charles Chong asked what we could learn from other countries to raise local fertility. Indeed, every country has its own policies and plans.&nbsp; We will study all these policies that they have and see what works for Singapore. What the French did may not necessarily work for Singapore.&nbsp; In fact, some of the social practices there may not be what Singaporeans want to have.&nbsp; I would not go into details on what they do, but I can tell Mr Chong and Members that we are studying our population package. We review them all the time.&nbsp; For now, we will keep the present package but we are looking at every item and see where we should put more money in.&nbsp;What we know is that we have to do more to encourage more and earlier marriages and births. We will monitor the implementation of the current package. We will also study how we can be more targeted in some of our incentives.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we can do this through a more targeted approach in three areas - better support for Singaporeans to achieve work-life balance, creating opportunities for more socialisation, and providing more targeted incentives for earlier marriages and earlier first births. I would like to thank Dr Ahmad Magad for his specific suggestions on how to increase our baby population.&nbsp; We are also open to other ideas and would welcome suggestions from the public as well. This has to be a collective effort, not just the Government putting on its thinking cap.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have an enormous strategic challenge ahead of us. Our population challenge is not to be taken lightly.&nbsp; It is easy to be lulled into complacency; our economy is doing well, many Singaporeans are better off today than they were 10 years ago. We need to look forward, but only if we are able to keep going as a vibrant and productive community and economy.&nbsp; We know what needs to be done. Three things. One, get married and have more babies. Two, welcome suitable immigrants and help them integrate into our society. And three, keep our overseas Singaporeans connected.&nbsp; I hope all our people will work together with the Government to achieve these objectives.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Overseas Voting</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member):</B> Sir, the first attempt at overseas voting was carried out last May. A total of 1,017 voters registered to vote at the eight overseas missions gazetted.&nbsp; After Nomination Day, the number of those eligible to vote in contested seats was 553 and the&nbsp;number of valid overseas votes eventually cast was 335.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the very small numbers must be a disappointment. The Government estimates that there are about 145,000 Singaporeans working or studying overseas and 1,017 out of 145,000 is less than 1%.&nbsp; Has the Prime Minister's Office assessed why the catchment was so low?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Sir, we should review the strict qualifying criteria under the Parliamentary Elections Act, in particular, the requirement of living for at least two out of the five years preceding the cut-off date of the Register of Electors.&nbsp; I shall call this the residency requirement which is waived if one is abroad for a longer time on Government business or with approved international organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the globalised world may require entrepreneurs to be away for several years and I do see a contradiction in the Government lavishing praise on Singaporeans who have ventured abroad on their own and broken new ground, and yet, restricting them from voting. These are the very people we risk losing.&nbsp; We should do away with the residency requirement so long as the overseas voter has a local address.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is also timely to consider increasing the number of overseas missions which accept overseas voter registration.&nbsp; Can we not prepare to use all our overseas missions and consular offices and not just the eight which are restricted to the five countries - China, USA, Australia, UK and Japan?&nbsp; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' website currently lists missions in 38 cities across 28 countries. So we have a few years before the next Elections, and I believe that there is ample time, if we are minded, to extend overseas voting centres to include all our overseas missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the last Elections, the overseas votes were counted separately four days after Polling&nbsp; Day.&nbsp; Since there were only about 335 votes, the results, when split by constituencies, involved very small numbers.&nbsp; In&nbsp;the single-member seats especially, the numbers for the constituencies were tiny, down to two voters at MacPherson and three for Nee Soon Central.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reporting of the overseas results separately raises concerns about confidentiality. For instance, in MacPherson, both voters voted for the People's Action Party. For Nee Soon Central, there were three voters; two voted for the Worker's&nbsp;Party and one for the PAP. These&nbsp;persons' votes, while secret, are thrown into the spotlight and they are obviously much less anonymous&nbsp;than local voters who are one vote among thousands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prevent this from recurring, I would like to suggest that the overseas voting at our missions take place early enough so that the overseas votes can be mixed with the local votes and counted together on&nbsp;Polling Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, overseas votes would be as anonymous as local votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to press reports, the overseas votes last year arrived only one day after Polling Day. As such, I feel confident that we can make it in time for Polling Day with a little adjustment.&nbsp; If needed, the Returning Officer can gazette Polling Day to be more than nine days after Nomination Day, say, 11 or 12 days later, to allow for the overseas votes to be couriered back in time for Polling Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we should not underestimate the effect of facilitating overseas voting if we are serious about keeping our diaspora connected to Singapore.&nbsp; I hope the Prime Minister's Office will consider my suggestions.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mr Wong, you have hardly five minutes left.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Sir, I thank Ms Sylvia Lim for raising the issue of overseas voting by Singaporeans overseas.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, following the 2006 General Election, I formed a Committee&nbsp;to review the various processes concerning overseas voting, as well as local voting.&nbsp; And one of the issues we looked at, of course, is how to make it easier for people to register to vote and how to make it possible for more Singaporeans to also be eligible to vote overseas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the registration process for overseas voters, we will try to make it more user-friendly.&nbsp; The time window for registration, publicity for registration using not just&nbsp;the media, but also as many channels as possible -&nbsp;we will&nbsp;study all these issues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the registration procedures, the Elections Department will also simplify them without sacrificing the integrity of voter identification and information authentication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The important issue is about&nbsp;the qualifying criteria to be eligible as an overseas voter. Right now, the law says&nbsp;it is two years out of the&nbsp;five years of&nbsp;residency&nbsp;before a person can qualify.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we set this, we studied the examples in other countries and we found that since it is the first time we are doing it, we have taken this approach of two years out of five years of residency as a requirement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But we know that they also return regularly to Singapore during their annual leave.&nbsp; So, the Government will study how the criteria can be eased and made more flexible so that more of them will qualify to vote while maintaining the spirit of the law that only those Singaporeans who maintain their links back home should be entitled to vote overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever we do to improve the processes for overseas polling or counting, we must still safeguard the integrity of the electoral process.&nbsp; The problem cited by Ms Lim regarding the counting of votes in Singapore, being four days after the close of poll, is limited to a small number of constituencies, particularly the single constituencies but, otherwise, there should not be any problem.&nbsp; We hope that in time to come, we can find a way to resolve this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether we will extend the number of days for campaigning or have people overseas to vote early or not, I think there are other implications to do this as well.&nbsp; So we have to be very careful in changing the present system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present election system is very simple.&nbsp; It is fair.&nbsp; It is transparent.&nbsp; It is well-tested.&nbsp; And the overseas voting system will follow the same system.&nbsp;&nbsp;The polling and counting of votes will follow the same system, as I said.&nbsp; Overseas voters will, therefore, continue to vote at the polling centres.&nbsp; Can we expand more?&nbsp; Well, we have to see where&nbsp;we have a critical mass.&nbsp; Not every city in all the 38 places where we have a consulate or a mission have enough Singaporeans to making voting practical.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, for practical reasons, our overseas polling stations will have to be in a mission where we have a large concentration of eligible overseas voters, and in the premises where we have a mission which will enjoy diplomatic immunity and, at the same time, security.&nbsp;

Critical to the success of this plan is the openness, responsiveness and helpfulness of our civil service.&nbsp; While we recognise that our civil service is a cut above the others, good may not be enough for a competitive world-class city.&nbsp; A proactive and helpful civil service which operates with great insight, ground sensitivity and attention to quality of service would certainly help our cause in developing a truly wholesome living and working experience in Singapore for Singaporeans, visitors and investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feedback often points to a disjointment of leadership directions to the implementation woes.&nbsp; An entire movie named \"Just Follow Law\" was dedicated to this subject.&nbsp; Yes, Sir, the movie is&nbsp;fiction.&nbsp; Nevertheless, some of the scenes and depictions resonate among fellow Singaporeans because of personal experiences.&nbsp; My question is: &nbsp;how can we enhance the quality of our civil service and foster social compact of trust between civil service and the people?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Many are groomed to take on top leadership roles.&nbsp; Many scholars are fast tracked and, in very short time periods, are parachuted into high-level and high-paying positions in the civil service.&nbsp; The PMO has told me that to prepare these scholars for their roles, they&nbsp;are given rounded exposure to the national challenges and issues facing Singapore.&nbsp; These include joining community attachment programmes, eg, I believe the People's Association or attachments with the voluntary welfare organisations, so that \"they have a better understanding of concerns and issues faced by Singaporeans.\"\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I submit that although this method might have worked in the past, in today's world, this old way is an inadequate way of developing talents in the civil service.&nbsp; I hear of a number of scholars and high potential civil servants who were assigned jobs they&nbsp;neither have a passion&nbsp;nor preparation for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Government is not yet open to the idea of scrapping the scholar programme, I urge the Government to consider doing two things in developing these talents in the civil service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Install a more structured framework of assessing the talent&nbsp; - what one is good at;&nbsp; passion - what one loves to do; and then match these profiles with the organisation's needs.&nbsp; Where the three areas intersect, this presents, I believe, the career sweet spot for the civil servant talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Instead of parachuting scholars too fast into positions writing papers and&nbsp;advising on national policies, let them go through what normal executives go through.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is one of the key contributors to the success of Singapore since independence.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public service has improved in quality over the years in line with the general population and demand of the economy.&nbsp; As we move ahead, the public service will have to become even more innovative and market savvy to help us take advantage to deal with new opportunities and challenges in an extremely competitive environment.&nbsp; For this to happen, it is important to attract and retain the best talents in the civil service.&nbsp; Salary is certainly a key deciding factor that will determine whether or not the public service can attract good people.&nbsp; The last time that public service pay was adjusted was in 2000, in order to narrow the salary gap between the civil service and the private sector, and to curb the stampede of talent to the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I would like to ask the Prime Minister whether public sector pay is competitive and in line with the private sector.&nbsp; Will there be any revision of public sector pay to ensure that it can attract and retain the best people?&nbsp; When will such a revision be completed?&nbsp; And also, to ensure that the revision will cover all sectors, all grades and all categories of public servants, and not just the elite or the scholars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I support this.&nbsp; Ministerial salaries and Administrative Service salaries are directly benchmarked to top private sector salaries as declared to the IRAS.&nbsp; The Staff Grade 1 salary is pegged at two-thirds of the income of the 24th highest earner among the two eight earners from six professions.&nbsp; The Superscale G salary is benchmarked using a similar formula.&nbsp; I also understand that Legal Service salaries are pegged, albeit not&nbsp;directly, to the private sector.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I would like to thank the Members for their interest in the public service.&nbsp; Ms Jessica Tan, Dr Magad, Ms Penny Low&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mr Alvin Yeo also spoke about this during the debate on the Budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully agree with Mr Zainudin that an effective public service is crucial to the implementation of the vision and plan set forth in the Budget Speech for a first-class city, a first-call country.&nbsp; Building a first-class public service has been and remains a high priority of this Government.&nbsp; A good public service plays a key role in a country's stability and economic development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the latest comparative country risk report just published by the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, better known as PERC, the quality of the public service is one of the key factors.&nbsp; Singapore was rated best among the 14 countries on the quality of the civil service, quality of government policies, effectiveness of the government in implementing economic policies and freedom from corruption.&nbsp; This is strong testimony of quality and reputation of our public service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To maintain the quality of the civil service, we must continue to attract and retain a fair share of talent.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah and other Members have asked what is being done to retain talent in the public sector in a tightening labour market.&nbsp; The civil service is beginning to feel the impact of this tightening labour market.&nbsp; Our resignation rates have increased from an average of 4.8% in 2005 to 5.7% in 2006.&nbsp; Some segments of the service are experiencing much higher attrition.&nbsp; For example, in the Management Executive Service, which is for graduate officers employed across a number of Ministries, the resignation rate has risen from 7.4% in 2005 to 10.6% in 2006.&nbsp; The attrition rate is higher at the entry level grade at 25%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In several services, even though attrition rates are not yet high, there is evidence that the market has become much tighter.&nbsp; We should not wait till these services are bleeding badly before we move to retain and maintain competitiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The civil service has to remain an attractive career option for good calibre people.&nbsp; As private sector wages rise, the wages of civil servants cannot remain stagnant.&nbsp; We do not aim to lead the private sector salaries but we must keep pace.&nbsp; If we are not responsive, we will lose our ability to recruit and keep able people.&nbsp; This will do great harm to Singapore as we would have lost one key advantage over other countries&nbsp; -&nbsp; a clean, competent and effective civil service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew asked how we benchmark civil service pay.&nbsp; Each scheme of service is benchmarked to its equivalent in the private sector.&nbsp; For example, the salaries of accountants and lawyers in the private sector serve as benchmarks for the same professions in the civil service.&nbsp; If there are no directly equivalent jobs, we look at jobs in the private sector that are held by employees who have similar types of backgrounds and&nbsp;educational qualifications, eg, graduates or diploma holders.&nbsp; The salary comparisons are based on the total annual salaries which include all annual and performance related components.&nbsp; There are no other additional components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last major salary revision for the civil service, as pointed out by Mdm Halimah, was in 2000.&nbsp; But, since then, we have reviewed and made adjustments to specific schemes that have fallen behind their market benchmarks and to improve their career structure to make them more competitive.&nbsp; For example, last September, the Education Service revised its starting salaries, added promotional grades and increased the retention payment for teachers.&nbsp; Such recently reviewed schemes of service are not too far from their private sector benchmarks.&nbsp; Nevertheless, some services have fallen significantly behind the private sector, especially in the last two years.&nbsp; An example is the Administrative Service which is the key service,&nbsp;from which most top public sector leaders are drawn.&nbsp; Administrative Service salaries have not been reviewed since the year 2000 nor have salaries for the political, judicial and statutory appointment holders&nbsp;which are pegged to the Administrative Service salary structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must ensure that public sector salaries stay competitive.&nbsp; Hence, the Government is currently reviewing public sector salaries.&nbsp; We expect to announce the revisions in April.&nbsp; Unlike the last round in 2000, there will not be</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

We will not just be adjusting salaries, but would take the opportunity to bring salary structures more in line with our philosophy of linking pay to performance.&nbsp; I would like to see as much as possible of the revisions paid in the form of performance-related components. This way, we reward deserving civil servants and sustain a high-performance culture in the civil service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides paying competitive salaries, the civil service also develops our officers for higher levels of contribution.&nbsp; Ms Denise Phua is not here.&nbsp; But we welcome new ideas - like those that Ms Denise Phua is going to suggest - on how we can do this better, and I would be happy to listen to her when she is able to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduates, including scholars, who join the service do a variety of jobs which put them in direct contact with citizens, customers and businesses. Examples include negotiating a free trade agreement, counselling a juvenile delinquent, handling a criminal investigation or mediating a labour dispute. These are real jobs where they meet people and have to solve problems together with citizens and customers. Officers who handle policy work are expected to pay attention to ground concerns and involve themselves in the implementation and delivery of the policies.&nbsp; Many Ministries have a job rotation system to give officers a rounded experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Administrative Officers undergo an attachment programme to grassroots organisations to better appreciate the issues and needs of ordinary Singaporeans. But the experience and exposure are not limited to just&nbsp;attachments. Officers in the Administrative Service could be seconded to statutory boards, Community Development Councils, NTUC and even the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public service recognises that there is always room for improvement in policies, systems and processes to be more citizen-focused and customer-centric.&nbsp; Let me give some examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, the public service established a Pro-Enterprise Panel to identify and review rules that pose unnecessary constraints and costs to businesses.&nbsp; Two thirds of the panel's members are actually from the private sector. We draw in private sector expertise to help us and to tell us what it is that we can&nbsp;do&nbsp;better. The panel has made headway in getting public agencies to change their rules for the better.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp; PERC&nbsp;assessed Singapore civil service as&nbsp;the best among the 14 countries surveyed&nbsp;in terms of&nbsp;red tape and how we have resolved the issues of red tape and bureaucracy as&nbsp;impediments to business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not watched Jack Neo's movie \"Just Follow Law\", which Mr Zainudin mentioned.&nbsp; But I have enjoyed some of his earlier movies. I like Jack Neo's movies because they make us look at ourselves - own attitudes and behaviour towards others. If this movie helps Singaporeans and public servants to be more self-aware and improve themselves, I think&nbsp;that would be good. But, of course, when you watch the movie - you are not watching a tutorial - do remember to enjoy yourself, after all, it is meant to entertain, and one can expect it to exaggerate for effect.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public service recognises that there are always rules that can be improved or need to be changed.&nbsp; Since 2002, all public agencies are required to review their existing rules every five years, including regulatory issues that cut across agencies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do agree though that, ultimately, it is not just rules but people who implement those rules that matter. The service has, therefore, put in much effort to educate public officers to adopt the right mindset. Officers are required to attend the Cut Red Tape workshop at the Civil Service College, where they learn to understand that what matters is the intent and spirit of the rules, rather than merely rigid implementation per se.&nbsp; But I will be the first to admit that we have some way to go yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a first class public service that is the envy of many other countries. We should not be afraid to criticise it and should feel free to make suggestions to improve it. After all, this is our public service. But we should also be proud of it and give credit where credit is due. Our civil servants afterall are human too, and a simple 'thank you' from time to time will, I am sure, be appreciated and motivate them to do their jobs even better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will strive to upgrade the service's capability and quality to move it to a higher league. We will improve processes, service delivery and our ability to anticipate and respond to changes and&nbsp; opportunities.&nbsp; But, most importantly, the service must remain attractive to high calibre people. We must pay competitive wages and provide challenging careers for those who join us.&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, we will be better placed to achieve our vision for Singapore to become a world class city state.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Miss Penny Low said that there could be a lack of deep understanding and localised knowledge among our local fund managers and our bankers, resulting in poor valuations compared to other capital markets.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the reasons behind market valuations across markets are varied and complex.&nbsp; Direct comparisons across markets are often not meaningful.&nbsp; I would find it hard to believe that our analysts, fund managers or bankers are less knowledgeable or lack depth of knowledge or understanding or are less sophisticated than in other markets.&nbsp; Perhaps, for some of the smaller market capital SMEs where there are less investor interests, there could be a smaller following of analysts and, therefore, that could result in a lack of knowledge of these companies.&nbsp; But, by and large, I think our markets are sophisticated enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low also asked whether our regulatory requirements and compliance costs could be another reason.&nbsp; Let me assure the Member that the regulatory authorities continue to monitor our regulatory oversight and make sure that compliance costs are not too high.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2005, MAS introduced two \"safe harbours\" in the Securities and Futures Act to allow private placements and small offers to be made without&nbsp;prospectuses.&nbsp; These safe harbours provide legal certainty for capital raising by our SMEs and help them raise funds more efficiently without incurring unnecessary regulatory costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, one of our&nbsp;local broking firms has developed an over-the-counter platform to facilitate trading in shares of SMEs which take advantage of these safe harbours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Exchange (SGX), through its mainboard and SESDAQ, has flexible admission criteria that allow companies with shorter, or no profit track record, to be listed.&nbsp; SESDAQ has served its role as a local SME market and some SESDAQ-listed companies have, indeed, grown and upgraded to the mainboard.&nbsp; Nevertheless, SGX is keenly aware of the competitive environment among exchanges and is studying the different regulatory models in the US, London and Asia for listing SMEs, with a view to introduce changes to the marketplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me assure Miss Penny Low that the situation is probably not as bad as she perceived it to be.&nbsp; Firstly, we have no indications of local SMEs going abroad to tap capital in a significant way.&nbsp; Secondly, the Milken Institute which compiles the capital access index which ranks countries around the world, in terms of financial infrastructures that support entrepreneurial activity by providing access to capital, Singapore, indeed, has been ranked second in this year's index, up from third place previously.&nbsp; So, by and large, I do not think we are doing badly.&nbsp; But I can say we can always improve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There are quite a number of jobs in the public service where there are no direct comparables in the private sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained earlier, where there are direct comparables, we would take the salaries of those types of jobs in the private sector and use those as benchmarks for the public sector jobs.&nbsp; But where there are no direct comparables, what we would do is we say, \"A person has a choice.&nbsp; He can either work&nbsp;in that&nbsp;kind of job, or this kind of job if he has this type of&nbsp; qualifications.\"&nbsp; And if a person with this sort of qualifications is working in the private sector and is earning roughly that amount of money, then if we want to attract the same sort of person to work in the public sector,&nbsp;which&nbsp;has no comparison in the private sector, then we should pay him around that amount of money as well.&nbsp; So we use that principle.&nbsp; It is important that for all our services, all our jobs, we try to find such market comparables or, at least, a way of making a comparison, so that when we pay salaries, we have some basis for doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some&nbsp;have risen quite sharply in the private sector, and others have risen, but it may not have risen as quickly as others.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Loo Choon Yong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So whenever we have the opportunity, say, a salary adjustment, preference is to put as much of this as possible into performance-related pay so that we actually come closer to, say, what is the market practice where a considerable percentage, maybe 25% or half a person's annual salary typically, is performance-related.&nbsp; I think that is a good principle to follow in the public service too because it encourages public servants to work hard, to do well, to perform well and it also enables the public service bosses to reward those who are working harder, to motivate them so that we can attract and retain those who are good officers and, at the same time, those who are not performing so well, they also get the correct signals.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But, in terms of outcome, the civil service very often does not have the same kind of bottomline&nbsp;as, say, a private company has, where if you look at the final numbers and accounts, you can see what the bottomline is.&nbsp; And the closest approximation which we have&nbsp;found to that is really the GDP growth rate.&nbsp; So we actually do have for some of our officers, especially the more senior officers, a GDP-linked component.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the GDP grows more quickly, there is a larger component.&nbsp;

Under the current model, the tax is levied on the income earned in the previous year of assessment, and the impact of any tax initiative will have some lag before it is felt effectively on the economy as people's present consumption and investment decisions take into account the amount that they have to pay for the previous year's assessment.&nbsp; It would also lessen the burden on people who lose employment but still have to pay tax on the previous year's income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, now, I will move to a few suggestions of promoting entrepreneurship and overseas expansion of enterprises.&nbsp; First, to provide tax incentives for individuals and companies to invest in private equity and start-ups.&nbsp; These could also be refined to encourage investment in the areas that Singapore sees itself developing a strategic strength in. The mechanics of the proposal could include income tax deductibility in whole or in part of investments made into private equity funds or in start-up companies.&nbsp; And the losses incurred, as a result of the investment not being successful, could also be allowed to be carried forward, in terms of income tax computation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the expected benefits include encouraging angel investors which we are greatly lacking here in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second suggestion is on deferral of taxation or payment of assessed tax for companies that are investing in overseas expansion.&nbsp; The proposal could include removing funds marked for overseas expansion from assessable income to allow companies to accumulate the capital base to make strategic investments overseas.&nbsp; Alternatively, such companies could also have their taxation deferred to facilitate their move overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, tax incentives for investment funds to be housed here.&nbsp; Presently, we have incentives which are geared to encourage investment activities out of Singapore.&nbsp; Funds themselves, however, are likely to continue to be parked overseas in the tax havens.&nbsp; This proposal would target having these funds move here from these tax haven countries.&nbsp;This could also be coupled with other incentives to encourage investment in private equity in startups that I talked about earlier.&nbsp;

Sir, the amount can be quite significant and the burden on the companies could be quite huge, especially for very capital-intensive companies.&nbsp; For example, I remember when I started UTAC in 1998, it took us almost a year to get the facilities ready for production, and we spent a lot of money and also borrowed some.&nbsp; It was quite a huge burden on us when we tried to operate a company with that kind of taxation and we could not deduct the borrowing costs from the amount that we have to pay for tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on GST.&nbsp; It is a welcome move that the Government will be helping smaller companies offset the cost of becoming GST-registered.&nbsp; Some Members have brought this up.&nbsp; The issue really is the cost of operating a GST-registered company.&nbsp; This cost will be much more than the cost of starting up as a GST company.&nbsp; The companies will have to employ additional resources to manage their GST-registered status.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, we have heard many times that, sometimes, it takes a long time for IRAS to credit companies making GST claims, especially when there are a certain number of queries that may have arisen.&nbsp; It could take a couple of months before the companies get their returns back from IRAS.&nbsp; This, therefore, will result in a huge cashflow burden for smaller companies.&nbsp; Could the Minister look into simplifying the procedures so that we can encourage many more companies to become GST-registered and, therefore, benefit from what the Government is trying to achieve by sponsoring their start-up to become GST-registered companies?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is good that there is a GST assistance package capped at $5,000 per SME to help defray cost for the SMEs voluntarily registering for GST for the first time.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, operationally, the impact of GST to SMEs will be more than the set-up cost.&nbsp; The current GST filing requirements and payment terms are not aligned to support SMEs.&nbsp; Most SMEs operate with 90 days and, in some cases, six months' payment terms with their clients.&nbsp; The current GST filing is on issue of invoice for these SMEs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, Mr Chairman, I ask the Minister that there be consideration given to the refinement of the filing and payment schedules for GST to allow SMEs to make payment when paid.&nbsp; This will help minimise the cashflow impact for SMEs and prove a good win-win situation.&nbsp; This will help achieve the objective, as Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said earlier, to make Singapore the best place to start, grow and globalise businesses for our SMEs.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Teo Ser Luck)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Retirement Planning</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with the concerns expressed by several Members of this House during the Budget Statement debate that the middle class has been squeezed over the last few years and considering that many of them are also middle-aged, I believe there should also be a corresponding sense of urgency to assist the middle income segment to increase their savings for retirement.&nbsp; This will help to alleviate the middle income squeeze issue from becoming a perpetual problem for the Government.&nbsp; The Government has also clearly stated in 2003 that the CPF would be more of a \"safety net\" for the middle and upper-wage earners, and that these people would have to take on more of their own planning for retirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As companies look to ways to drive more loyalty from Singaporean workers and to attract more foreign talent for critical assignments, a private company-run plan can be a strong draw, while also functioning as a retention component for employees.&nbsp; At the same time, it has the potential to significantly enhance long-term retirement savings for the middle class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One time-tested model that we could consider to base on is the US 401K plan which has contribution limits that do not make them a major part of the high-income segment's retirement savings.&nbsp; However, middle-class participants in the US who start early and regularly contribute to these plans are pleasantly surprised to discover that, over the years, their savings grow to hundreds of thousands of dollars.&nbsp; It is my understanding that the 401K plan in the US is the largest single asset in many people's retirement portfolios.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to repeat my proposal made last year that consideration be made to amend section 5 of the Income Tax Act, so as to allow companies to create tax deferred savings plans into which both the company and its employees can make contributions.&nbsp; This would not affect CPF in any way.&nbsp; People and companies would continue to contribute to CPF accounts, just as they do today.&nbsp; However, the level of contributions to the private pension scheme could be linked to CPF contribution limits in some way, and that the maximum contribution level could be capped at an amount that would not make the programme a windfall for the wealthy.&nbsp; The 401K plans, for example, are set up such that the company matches some of the employees' contributions into their savings.&nbsp; For these matches, employees typically earn anywhere from 30%-60% on their investments right away.&nbsp; Subsequently, this money grows with tax being deferred until it is withdrawn many years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scheme I would like to suggest could take the following or some modified form:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Limits for defined contribution plans could be capped at, say, 20% of salary, less employer contribution to CPF, instead of being capped at the level of benefits payout;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Employers should have the discretion to determine eligibility to the retirement benefit plan;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Employers should have flexibility in determining contribution level or benefit level;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Pooling of the retirement funds under one master trust could also be considered so as to attract low unit costs from fund managers;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; Portability of the retirement savings should preferably be permitted;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; The benefit withdrawn at retirement should be tax-exempt, provided they are used to purchase an annuity; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7)&nbsp; Double tax deduction to employees and employers for contributions made towards retirement savings should be considered to encourage contribution to the fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe these recommendations can provide relative tax efficiency, impose the discipline that the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS)&nbsp;lacks, and could be used to assist the Government's aim of devolving retirement responsibilities to the private sector.&nbsp; They also provide tax efficient benefits to foreign nationals who are always on the lookout for safe and tax-incentivised environments to park their funds.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Perhaps, after one year, it is&nbsp;a good time to take stock of the lessons learnt and to consider Temasek's role in the management of our reserves and how it is carried out.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public refrain from the Government, whenever this topic comes up, is that Temasek is a commercial entity, which enters into transactions on a commercial basis, and that the Government neither approves individual investments by Temasek nor second guesses its risk assessment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is whether the perception of those whom Temasek would like to do business with, especially in the region, matches the situation as described by the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perception is important in business decisions, especially in this region.&nbsp; It is important to Singapore that Temasek is not blocked from investments that have potential to bring us good returns.&nbsp; The <I>Financial Times</I> has reported that Temasek has encountered barriers in increasing banking investments in India and South Korea while its investments in three Chinese banks appear to have raised concerns among the authorities.&nbsp; The concern, it seems, is that Temasek is an arm of the Government.&nbsp; At the very least, it is possible to accept the Government's refrain on Temasek and yet wonder, not illogically, if Temasek, on its own accord, takes some cues from the Government's thinking on our national interests and strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Temasek's 60% owned wafer business, Chartered Semiconductors, has had losses of more than $1 billion since 2001.&nbsp; Its fortunes have turned recently, but should an investor like Temasek and its shareholder, the Ministry of Finance, be all right with such losses?&nbsp; A point to consider is the importance of cheap manufacturing to Singapore.&nbsp; These are the considerations that colour people's perceptions of Temasek and its role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what can we do to help Temasek and its investment to give us good returns?&nbsp; Some economists have suggested it before.&nbsp; Would Singapore be better served with companies in the hands of an array of private-sector shareholders rather than Temasek?&nbsp; Given how important the external economy is to a small and open country like Singapore, would it be better if Temasek were freed up to focus fully on external investments and growing Singapore's external economy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that Temasek is moving towards a portfolio mix of one-third domestic, one-third regional and one-third OECD.&nbsp; Perhaps, it should plan to eventually reduce its share of domestic investments even further.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How could it help?&nbsp; For example, Temasek has identified banks as core to its investment strategies and has been fairly aggressive recently in pursuing this strategy.&nbsp; Last year, it acquired about $4 billion of Standard Chartered Bank, and there is speculation that Temasek could merge StanChart with DBS Bank.&nbsp; If it becomes harder for Temasek to add further bank holdings in the region, because governments are wary of its intentions, would it not help to alleviate the nationalistic factor by unpacking national companies like DBS from Temasek's baggage?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While some might think that one approach is to invest less in the region to avoid being dragged into the pitfalls of domestic politics in the region, I think it is better to deepen our links with our neighbours.&nbsp; It is better for our interests to be tied strongly with the interests of our neighbours, and for our neighbours to believe that we are genuine.&nbsp; It is simply a question of how do we manage this best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point I would like to ask the Ministry of Finance is whether it believes Temasek can do better in its accountability to Singaporeans.&nbsp; Sir, since the Shin Corp deal, Temasek has been even more tight-lipped than usual.&nbsp; A lapse last year revealed Temasek's template on how to \"spin\" replies to media queries on a wide range of issues, not just on Shin Corp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is not unreasonable for a company which manages our reserves and our hard-earned taxes to be more forthcoming in explaining its decisions and sharing its assessments.&nbsp; I note worryingly that our 2007 estimates for capital receipts are 54% less or $3.8 billion less than last year's revised estimates.&nbsp; How much of Shin Corp has a bearing on this?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Vehicle Taxes</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</B> Sir, from 28th February 2003, the rates of excise duty for various grades of petrol are fixed as follows:\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I went to the petrol station recently.&nbsp; For 51.1 litres of petrol, the total, including GST, was $63.57, of which $22.48&nbsp;was the petrol duty.&nbsp; &nbsp;I calculated.&nbsp; The total GST amount was $3.03, out of which, the GST on the petrol duty was $1.12.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

More importantly, I would like to ask the Minister for Finance whether, in principle, it is right and fair to charge GST on top of excise duty.&nbsp; Is this not a tax on another tax?&nbsp; Should the GST not be imposed only on the non-duty portion of the petrol price?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Properly done, this is a fair and transparent method of performance evaluation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does seem that the KPIs for the Ministries are intended to serve such a purpose.&nbsp; If so, I think it will be helpful if the Minister could explain the consequences of a Ministry's failure to achieve its KPIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, we must remember that Singapore, as a small country, is subject to external pressures. So, sometimes, a failure to achieve a KPI may not be attributable to poor performance. That will be so, especially for KPIs related to the economy, such as KPIs tied to economic growth.&nbsp; But, surely, external circumstances cannot possibly explain all failures to achieve KPIs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister to clarify how these KPIs are set.&nbsp; I ask this because some KPIs set for financial year 2007 are actually lower than the achievements from preceding years which does seem odd to me. I would give three examples to the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, MCYS has a KPI based on the recidivism rate of Mandatory Counselling Programme clients.&nbsp; In FY 2004 and 2005, the&nbsp;rates were 2.7% and 1% respectively.&nbsp; In FY 2006, it rose to 5%. For FY 2007, the target remains at 5%. That seems strange when we have previously achieved much lower targets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Ministry of Home Affairs has a KPI for the number of fatal and serious injury road accidents per 10,000 motor vehicles. For FY 2004, 2005 and 2006, the actual percentage ranged from 3.4% to 3.9%.&nbsp; Yet, the FY 2007 target is 6.5%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Ministry of Manpower has a KPI based on the total upgrading supported by headcount.&nbsp; In FY 2006, this was 73,000, but the FY 2007 target is 64,000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if the KPIs are not used for performance evaluation purposes, then I hope that the Minister would clarify the purpose of these KPIs.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir,&nbsp;first,&nbsp;let me thank Members for their comments and suggestions.&nbsp;The issues that they have&nbsp;raised fall under the following three categories:\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp; Making the tax system more effective;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp; Enhancing financial stewardship of our investments; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp; Strengthening the framework for governance and accountability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our tax system seeks to promote enterprise and entrepreneurship while raising sufficient revenues to meet our expenditure needs. The key tax changes this year will help Singapore attract more investments and create more good jobs over time, and opportunities for our people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our income tax system is characterised by low headline rates coupled with targeted incentives and reliefs to promote enterprise and effort.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this year's Budget, we have enhanced a number of our tax incentives to boost our capital markets. These changes will further strengthen Singapore as a financial centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has suggested that, beyond these measures, the Government should encourage investments in private equity by allowing upfront income tax relief on such investments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our tax regime is already highly favourable for all investments by individuals, including in private equity.&nbsp; We do not tax capital gains.&nbsp; For approved start-ups, we have the Enterprise Investment Incentive (EII) which shares the risk faced by investors by granting them tax relief for investment losses made on disposal.&nbsp; Sharing the downside risks on these investments and allowing investors to keep their upside gains by not having a capital gain tax is better than an upfront deduction of investment which could distort investment choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Singh also has proposed to grant either tax deduction for funds for investment or tax deferral&nbsp;for companies that invest in overseas expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we do not tax capital gains in the first place, we cannot allow deductions for capital funds marked for overseas expansion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree, however, there is a stronger case for deferring tax for overseas operations that have yet to turn profitable, as this will ease the cashflow of companies. This is why we introduced the Overseas Investment Incentive (OII) scheme in 1987, and further enhanced it in 2004, to allow an approved company to defer for two years its income taxes from its profitable operations in Singapore, if its approved overseas investments incur operating losses in the first three years of investment.&nbsp; However, this scheme had no takers after the 2004 enhancement. The feedback we got from companies was that they did not see the tax deferment as an \"incentive\" since they still had to pay the taxes later. The scheme has since lapsed.&nbsp; However, if there is strong interest by companies in the scheme, we will be happy to re-introduce it with modifications, if need be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh has also asked about incentives to encourage investment activities from Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have several tax incentives to promote the fund management and venture capital industries in Singapore, including the foreign investor tax exemption incentive schemes and the venture capital fund incentive.&nbsp; Together with the economic agencies, MOF monitors and regularly reviews the effectiveness of these incentive schemes.&nbsp; My Ministry welcomes suggestions on new incentives or modification of existing ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Singh has also asked about allowing a tax deduction on borrowing cost during the start-up or construction period of an asset.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our current practice is to allow deductions only for expenses associated with assets that generate an income.&nbsp; In the case of assets that are still in the process of being constructed, all expenses, including interest and other borrowing costs, are classified as capital in nature because they are not incurred in the production of income. And since we do not tax capital gains, these expenses are not tax-deductible.&nbsp;Having said that, I should add that we will continue to review our position, taking into account business practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our tax system also promotes savings, especially savings for retirement. With an ageing population, enhancing the retirement adequacy of Singaporeans is a major priority for Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad and Miss Penny Low have asked what the Government is doing to help the middle income group save for their retirement.&nbsp; In particular, they have asked if it is time to review and revamp the SRS and&nbsp;Section 5 Pension Funds, so as to enhance the retirement savings of the middle-income segment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tax treatment of contributions to the SRS and Section 5 Pension Funds has to be considered within the larger framework of retirement savings in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CPF, as all Members would know, is the central component of this larger framework. The CPF helps Singaporeans save for basic retirement, homeownership and healthcare.&nbsp; CPF savings are given comprehensive preferential tax treatment - contributions, investment returns and withdrawals are all tax-exempt. This is more generous than most pension systems in the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SRS is a voluntary savings scheme on top of tax-advantaged, mandatory CPF savings.&nbsp; Contributions to SRS are eligible for tax relief, and investment returns are not taxed at the time of accrual.&nbsp; The SRS is more generous than the US' 401(k)&nbsp;plans which require the employee to pay income tax on the full 100% of the monies withdrawn during retirement.&nbsp; In the case of the SRS, only 50% of the withdrawals are taxable at retirement and, with proper streaming of the withdrawals after retirement, many people will pay little or no income tax.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SRS allows individuals to accumulate significant levels of retirement savings with tax benefits.&nbsp; A Singaporean or PR who contributes at the current full contribution rate of $11,475 per year, say, from age 30 to his retirement at 62, will accumulate over $620,000 of SRS savings, assuming a conservative 3% rate of return on his investments. This will be over and above his CPF savings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the SRS appeals to a narrow range of tax-paying employees. It does not appear to be running out of steam; in fact, it has grown steadily by an average of 25% per year, from 11,890 since its introduction in 2001 to 35,724 in 2006.&nbsp; Nonetheless, my Ministry will continue to explore other ways of enhancing and promoting the SRS to increase participation in the scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thank Members for their proposals to enhance the pension funds approved under section 5 of the Income Tax Act, or Section 5 funds for short.&nbsp; We will examine the proposals carefully.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let me just add that, again, we must view the Section 5 funds not in isolation but within the larger context of the CPF and the SRS.&nbsp; In fact, with the SRS, there is less justification to provide tax advantages for the section 5 funds as well.&nbsp; Tax advantages are already given to the SRS which is an employee-based scheme.&nbsp; It provides portability - SRS savings will remain in the SRS accounts even with&nbsp;a change of employers.&nbsp; Furthermore, the SRS does not preclude employers from making private arrangements with their employees for them to make contributions to their SRS accounts. The Section 5 funds, however, remain useful as employer-based schemes, for employers to supplement the retirement savings of the employees as well as the talent retention tool.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to vehicle taxes.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min has asked for the rationale of pegging road tax to engine capacity.&nbsp; Road tax is a part of the vehicle ownership tax structure.&nbsp; We have based the road tax formula on engine capacity because we want to have a progressive tax structure.&nbsp; It is not unreasonable that car-owners who wish to drive higher-end performance and luxury cars, which typically have higher engine capacities, pay more road taxes.&nbsp; Using engine capacity is a relatively straightforward and transparent way to ensure progressivity in the road tax structure, as it is part of a vehicle's technical specification and it is also a measure which car owners are familiar with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I agree that engine capacity is not a perfect proxy for the value of a car.&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are other vehicle ownership taxes, namely, the Additional Registration Fee (ARF) and excise duty of a vehicle, which are pegged to the Open Market Value (OMV) of a vehicle, and these take into account the differences in the market value of vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will continue to review the basis of road tax periodically to ensure that it remains relevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong has asked whether there is double taxation by imposing GST on the total cost of petrol, since there is already a duty paid on petrol.&nbsp; He has proposed that GST should only be imposed on the non-duty portion of the petrol price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, GST is a tax on the final value of a good or service consumed in Singapore.&nbsp; This includes any duties imposed in the course of supplying these goods and services.&nbsp; The duty levied on petrol is a part of the final price payable for the consumption of petrol. In the same way, GST is payable on duties levied on tobacco and liquor.&nbsp; This is also the practice in other countries with GST or value added tax systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have&nbsp;also asked if we should review our diesel taxes.&nbsp; Significant advances have been made in diesel engine technology in recent years that have made diesel cleaner.&nbsp; Indeed, this is why the Ministry for the Environment and Water Resources introduced the Euro IV emission standards for all types of new diesel vehicles from 1st October 2006.&nbsp; Euro IV diesel vehicles are less pollutive than Euro II diesel vehicles, emitting 70% less particulate matter (PM).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Euro IV diesel vehicles are still not as clean as petrol vehicles.&nbsp; In fact, compared to petrol vehicles, they still emit about&nbsp;five times more particulate matter of less than 2.5 microns in size (PM2.5) and oxides of nitrogen.&nbsp; This is of particular concern to us as studies have shown that PM2.5 is linked to respiratory diseases such as bronchitis and asthma.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hence, we will continue to discourage diesel passenger cars on our roads through the imposition of a diesel tax.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to track the development of diesel technologies as they develop, and review our policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to compliance costs. A key element of a competitive and pro-enterprise tax system is to keep the cost of compliance to businesses and organisations low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why we have kept the GST as a broad based tax that applies to almost all goods and services consumed locally.&nbsp; Our GST rules are simple and exemptions sparse.&nbsp; This also allows GST rates to be kept low for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad has asked whether Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) will incur GST on their operations.&nbsp; Yes, they will.&nbsp; NPOs are treated like any business as far as GST is concerned.&nbsp; NPOs that make taxable supplies can register for GST and claim input tax on purchases.&nbsp; And as with any other business, NPOs that do not make GST-taxable supplies cannot register for GST and claim input tax.&nbsp; For registered NPOs that receive subsidies, some of their expenses would be defrayed by the subsidies.&nbsp; Hence, the input tax on these expenses will not be claimable because no GST was charged on the subsidies.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Jessica Tan has expressed concern over SMEs managing their cashflow with respect to the current GST filing and payment schemes.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has also asked about the cost of operating as a GST-registered company, as well as ways to simplify the refund process so as to reduce the cash flow burden for companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have explained to the Members in this House before, let me reiterate that most GST-registered persons, some 94%, do not have difficulties in making their output GST payments to IRAS.&nbsp; Our GST filing and payment schedules impose a minimal cash flow burden on companies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate their own cashflow management, businesses can choose a monthly, quarterly or half-yearly accounting period.&nbsp; They have one month from the end of the chosen accounting period to pay the net output tax to IRAS. Businesses that pay via GIRO have an additional 15 days to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For businesses that buy on credit, they can claim the input tax at the time of invoicing and need not wait till they have actually made payments on their purchases.&nbsp; These businesses are thus able to claim their input tax against the output tax charged to customers resulting in a cash flow advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMEs that face cash flow issues and have less than $1 million&nbsp;in annual turnover can also apply to be placed on the cash accounting scheme or, alternatively, the half-yearly accounting period.&nbsp; This helps alleviate the cash flow impact of extending long credit terms to their customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the cash accounting scheme, businesses need only to account to IRAS for output tax on their supply when they receive payments from customers.&nbsp; For these businesses, they are however only entitled to claim input tax on their purchases when they have made payment to their suppliers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one-off start-up cost of GST registration is about $3,000, which, as Mr Inderjit Singh has pointed out, is subsidised.&nbsp; According to IRAS' survey, the running cost per year of administering the GST system is about $1,800 for a typical SME.&nbsp; Only companies with revenues of more than $1 million are required to register for GST, and I think for such companies,&nbsp;this cost is manageable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for GST refunds, currently, IRAS' service standard is to process GST refunds within 30 days from the receipt of the return. In practice, over 90% of the refunds are processed within&nbsp;eight days.&nbsp; IRAS will continue to shave down the processing time to make GST refunds.&nbsp; Going forward, IRAS will target to process and send 85% of the e-filed refunds onward to the banks by the next working day, and 90% within&nbsp;two working days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, moving on to the current year basis of assessment, Mr Inderjit Singh has suggested that we consider switching from a present year basis to a current year basis for assessing income tax.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have indeed considered this.&nbsp; In 2005, the Ministry of Finance studied whether to switch to a current year basis of assessment, ie, having the employer deduct the tax payments from the employees' salaries and remitting it to the tax authorities directly.&nbsp; We too felt that there could be some advantages to bring about a better matching of the taxpayers' incomes and their expenditures and to enhance the effectiveness of the tax system as a fiscal stabiliser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the feedback from the public consultation exercise that was conducted then was not in favour of switching to a current year basis of assessment.&nbsp; Firstly, taxpayers had concerns over the practical difficulties in estimating their own current year's income, so as to pay their taxes upfront. There was also concern over the high compliance costs to be incurred by businesses and individuals as a result of the periodic filing and the withholding of tax required under the current year basis.&nbsp; The concerns are still valid.&nbsp; We are nonetheless prepared to reconsider this proposal should the reasons for adopting current year basis become more compelling in future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now move on to issues related to financial stewardship of Government's assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Olsen has asked about the role of Temasek Holdings with regard to its investments and the monitoring of performance. Temasek is Government's investment holding company.&nbsp; It is a long-term investor, with stakes in a broad range of companies principally in Singapore and in the region. &nbsp;Let me just recap to the House that its mission is to create and maximise long-term shareholder value as an active investor and shareholder of a portfolio of assets and investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked if the role is still relevant today.&nbsp; Temasek's role is still very much relevant today, in terms of delivering good long-term risk-adjusted investment returns. Temasek&rsquo;s investment decisions will continue to be based on commercial considerations and guided by its four investment themes of getting exposure to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i)&nbsp;rising Asian economies;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii)&nbsp;growing middle class;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii)&nbsp;deepening comparative advantages; and<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv)&nbsp;emerging champions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issues raised by Ms Olsen have been extensively discussed in this House, specifically on the Shin Corp investment, back in November last year.&nbsp; If I may just recap some of the specific issues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked if Temasek would be selling all its shares in Shin Corp at a huge loss and what the impact would be.&nbsp; The Government will leave it to Temasek to make all its investment decisions based on commercial considerations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She alluded to how Temasek is going to recover some of these huge losses and what the penalties would be.&nbsp; Temasek manages a diversified portfolio and takes concentrated risks.&nbsp; Its overall investment portfolio has continued to do well, achieving commendable returns with total shareholder return of 17% by shareholder funds and 18% by shareholder value since inception.&nbsp; Temasek is expected to do well for Financial Year 2006 and to pay dividends to the Government as a shareholder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will Temasek be held accountable for the losses, if realised?&nbsp; The Government looks at Temasek's overall performance.&nbsp; In this respect, as I have said, Temasek is expected to do well for this year and will continue to pay dividends to Government as a shareholder.&nbsp; Like all professional investment companies, Temasek continues to learn from its experiences with all investment deals, whether positive or negative.&nbsp; And this is how Temasek can develop and transform itself into a leading investment house.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me just reiterate once again that Temasek is accountable to Government as shareholder for delivering a good rate of return on its <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">overall</i> investment portfolio and not on each and every single investment in isolation. The Government does not influence, nor interfere with, nor micro-manage, nor second-guess any of Temasek's individual investments.&nbsp; And the Government's role is really to ensure that a competent board of directors is in place to guide Temasek's investments, and that the investment process is robust and rigorous.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to the issues of governance and accountability, corporate governance for commercial and non-commercial entities and the framework for driving public sector performance.&nbsp; Singapore's reputation on trust and governance as well as effective and efficient public service is well recognised and a key competitive advantage for us.&nbsp; We must continue to build on this reputation and strengthen it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, strengthening corporate governance and disclosure standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Inderjit Singh that we must strike the right balance between having sufficient rules to protect investors' interest &nbsp;and keeping the compliance burden on companies reasonable.&nbsp; We must never make it onerous or costly for companies to operate in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, we have taken several steps to strengthen Singapore's reputation, such as launching the Council on Corporate Disclosure and Governance in 2002 which has the authority to regulate accounting standards for both listed and unlisted companies, introducing the Code of Corporate Governance and mandating all companies to comply with the prescribed accounting standards.&nbsp; However, we are very conscious that we should not go overboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Elaborating on the example by Mr Inderjit Singh, we have seen how an over-zealous approach to corporate governance in the US has unwittingly imposed heavy compliance costs, reduced business flexibility, and hampered capital-raising.&nbsp; It is estimated that, since the introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, the cost of being a public-listed company in the US has escalated by some 100 to 200 percent and, instead of focusing on growing their companies, senior executives are increasingly distracted by legal compliance and burdened with hefty costs.&nbsp; The US has seen an exodus of IPOs, with smaller US companies choosing to list overseas, such as on the London Stock Exchange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we must also customise our rules to fit the context.&nbsp; Hence, our corporate regulatory system differentiates between listed and unlisted corporate entities.&nbsp; Unlisted companies typically do not raise funds from the public and, hence, some of the safeguards to protect shareholders' interests, such as the public disclosure of directors' remuneration in bands, are less relevant.&nbsp; And&nbsp;one area for further customisation and improvement is accounting standards for entities such as societies and charities.&nbsp; Whilst we have a proper authority to regulate accounting standards for companies, there is no similar authority when it comes to non-corporate entities such as societies and charities. Many of these entities have simply followed the&nbsp;Financial Reporting Standards which were drawn up primarily for commercial entities and not always suitable for their needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We, therefore, need a more comprehensive approach to setting accounting&nbsp;standards for the various kinds of entities in the different sectors.&nbsp; The Government has, therefore, decided to set up an Accounting Standards Board (ASB) that will issue accounting standards for entities not in the public sector, including companies and other entities such as charities, societies and co-operatives.&nbsp; The ASB will replace the current Council on Corporate Disclosure and Governance (CCDG) and will come into effect on 1st September 2007.&nbsp;Like the CCDG, the ASB will continue to issue accounting standards for companies, taking reference from those issued by the International Accounting Standards Board but evaluating carefully their relevance to the local context.&nbsp; In addition, the ASB will prescribe modifications to accounting standards to make them relevant for other non-public sector entities such as charities, co-operatives and societies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASB will comprise key regulators, senior accounting professionals, and leading users of financial information.&nbsp;&nbsp; This new consolidated framework for accounting standards under the ASB will enhance the credibility of financial reporting and achieve consistency in standards across the sectors.&nbsp; But&nbsp;the ASB will not replace the regulators for the various sectors, who will continue to oversee the corporate governance requirements for the entities under their purview.&nbsp; For instance, the Commissioner of Charities will continue to oversee corporate governance requirements for charities, while the MAS and SGX will oversee corporate governance for listed companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For public-sector&nbsp;entities, like Statutory Boards, the Government will assign the Accountant-General's Department as the legal authority to set accounting standards.&nbsp; Statutory boards do not have public shareholders - they are instead accountable to Parliament.&nbsp; The reporting requirements for purposes of accountability will, therefore, have to be different.&nbsp; Having a separate arrangement for setting accounting standards for private sector entities is consistent with the approach taken by other countries such as Canada, the UK and the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let me now speak about how my Ministry will continue to pursue and enhance public sector accountability and performance.&nbsp; Mr Singh has asked how the Government ensures that under the block budget system, the use of public funds is aligned with the Government's objectives and national interests.&nbsp; Theblock budgeting system sets a ceiling for Ministries' expenditure by capping their spending as a&nbsp;percentage of GDP and gives Ministries the flexibility in how they can achieve their desired outcomes without having to seek approval from the MOF for every item of expenditure.&nbsp;Notwithstanding the discretion accorded by the block budgeting system, there are sufficient checks in place to ensure proper accountability for public funds.&nbsp; After the block budgets are set, MOF continues to ensure that Ministries are doing the right things and doing them right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the MOF meets each Ministry at least twice a year to discuss the strategic directions and the&nbsp;longer-term spending needs, achievements and financial management.&nbsp; These discussions seek to ensure that each Ministry's plans and programmes are aligned with the&nbsp;overall national goals and priorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, not all spending is at the discretion of the individual Ministries.&nbsp; Significant development expenditures require approval by the Development Planning Committee (DPC) which rigorously evaluates the worthiness of each project and assesses whether its objectives are aligned with the national interest as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, regular evaluations are conducted by the Accountant-General's Department (AGD) on how funds have been used, whether the expenditure has produced value-for-money and whether their targeted outcomes have been achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Singh has asked whether the Auditor-General would be able to audit Ministries effectively, given the block budgeting system.&nbsp; Sir, the role of the Auditor-General, as defined in the Constitution, is to audit and report on the accounts of the Government.&nbsp; In this role, the AGO's jurisdiction is wide-ranging and has been focusing on reviewing key financial systems and controls which are applicable, regardless of block budgeting or line budgeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, MOF will strengthen the framework by achieving better value and performance by putting in place regular, structured reviews on how agencies are allocating public funds.&nbsp; And to do this, MOF will set up a Value-for-Money Review Office in the Accountant-General's Department (AGD) to expand the performance-based reviews.&nbsp; And as an independent party which is not involved in the budget allocation process, the AGD will provide objective observations on whether Government goals have been achieved with value for money.&nbsp; MOF will work with the Ministries to address any observations that may arise from these reviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, all Ministries have to submit a yearly Report Card to the Cabinet for their performance on the desired outcomes for the past year and their directions for the years ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to thank Mr Siew Kum Hong&nbsp;for his interest in the KPIs or the&nbsp;Key Performance Indicators.&nbsp; I wish to add that some of the key indicators found in the Report Card to the Cabinet are actually reported in the Budget Book.&nbsp; Mr Siew has asked about the relevance of these KPIs.&nbsp;&nbsp;These KPIs are set with reference to our national strategic outcomes and formulated based on best practices from other countries and international organisations.&nbsp; Ministries continually review these KPIs in consultation with their Government Parliamentary Committees to ensure that they remain meaningful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We employ KPIs in the same manner as many other countries do - to monitor performance and the achievement of stated outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Salient KPIs are scrutinised by Cabinet, and Members of Parliament may comment on them.&nbsp; The Ministry of Finance also uses KPIs to engage Ministries on whether they are measuring&nbsp; the right things, and whether their strategic outcomes are aligned with national priorities.&nbsp; It serves more as a dashboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, we do not tie budgets to the meeting of KPIs.&nbsp; Budget should be seen as a means to good performance rather than a reward for performances.&nbsp; Indeed, if a KPI is not met, it could mean that the Ministry needs more resources than less.&nbsp; A more indepth understanding on why KPIs are not being met could then lead to more resource adjustments or programme.&nbsp; If there are&nbsp;questions on specific KPIs, Members of Parliament can raise these queries at the COS debate for the respective Ministries.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But these legal aid services are only available to persons who pass the means test,&nbsp;that is, the applicant's disposable capital is not more than $7,000 or the applicant's disposable income does not exceed $10,000 per annum, that is, about $850 per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with rising prices of consumer goods and higher salary, many low-wage earners with salary of between $900 and $1,500 will not be able to meet the criteria to use the legal aid services.&nbsp; At the same time, these low-wage earners cannot afford to engage private lawyers and do not know how to make representations in courts.&nbsp; As a result, many have no choice but to plead guilty and suffer the consequences of the law without mitigating their cases.&nbsp; This situation is unfair to the low-income households.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the capital means test of $7,000 of disposable capital also poses a problem for low-income households.&nbsp; I have one MPS case where my resident bought a secondhand car and subsequently went into financial difficulties.&nbsp; He is unable to sell his car as he would have to incur further financial losses.&nbsp; But the car has a disposal value of more than $7,000.&nbsp; As such, he is not eligible for legal aid services.

As many of these law-abiding people do not wish to get involved in lawsuits and suffer further personal financial losses, they will just make payment to get over it. However, there are cases when individuals need to defend themselves in court, but they are not able to afford the costly legal fees. In such cases, they will turn to the Legal Aid Bureau to apply for free legal assistance and representation. But, often, they are not likely to have their wish fulfilled because they will not pass the means test conducted by the Legal Aid Bureau.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, there are ordinary folks who wish to seek resolution through the court for purposes, such as to claim back their rental deposits, to chase away tenants who had failed to pay rentals promptly, to recover monies in commercial dealings or to claim refund of course fees from private institutions. To engage a lawyer will mean that they have to incur substantial legal costs to pursue these claims and, as such, they feel that the cost incurred in lawsuits will greatly exceed the sum they seek to claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore is renowned for upholding the rule of law. However, there are low-income people who are not eligible for free legal service offered by the Legal Aid Bureau. To them, this is difficult to comprehend and ironical. These people often feel that they will have no choice but to helplessly watch the cheats or the law-breaker go scot-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Government if it will broaden the scope of assistance offered by the Legal Aid Bureau, or to lower the threshold of the means test. In the event that the low-income people are involved in court cases relating to scams and swindles, or are issued summonses by the Town Council, SP Services, Traffic Police (TP), Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) or other Government departments, the Government will appoint a lawyer to represent them, so as to facilitate an out-of-court settlement.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As buildings grow older, they cost much more to upkeep.&nbsp; Like HDB estates, private estates also need upgrading.&nbsp; However, individual MCSCs often do not have sufficient funds to upgrade.&nbsp; In one instance I am aware of, residents of a private condominium were faced with a bill to replace six dirty old lifts at a cost of $300,000 per lift.&nbsp; This far exceeded what they had in their coffers.&nbsp; Often, the only solution is for a single developer to purchase the entire estate and put something new and more efficient in its place.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years back, the Government revamped the law to allow older estates to go en-bloc if 90% or 80% of the subsidiary proprietors agreed, depending on the age of the estate.&nbsp; That freed up many estates, and has accounted for the wave of en-blocs we are now experiencing.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the issue of money often brings out the worst in some, and they have tried to benefit unconscionably from the situation.&nbsp; There are also some who understandably want to remain in their homes for sentimental reasons.&nbsp; Conflicting interests have raised temperatures and breakdowns in relationships.&nbsp; This is unfortunate.&nbsp; But the underlying premise must be that the law should facilitate well-founded applications, with the protection that, if you are forced to sell your home against your wishes, you should at least be reasonably compensated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That has given rise to another problem.&nbsp; The law provides that the Strata Titles Board will allow applications for en-bloc sales, unless the distribution is inequitable.&nbsp; But the Act does not define what \"inequitable\" means.&nbsp; Thus far, distribution is by share value, but some have argued that this is insufficient and inequitable because the distribution should take into account the size of the units, their renovation costs or their superior views.&nbsp; The Strata Titles Board can oppose the application for en-bloc sales if an owner can demonstrate a financial loss.&nbsp; Right now, financial loss is said to have been suffered if the sale proceeds of a unit, after the deductions allowed by the Board, are less than what the owner paid for the unit.&nbsp; But, again, the Act does not define what \"deductions\" are.&nbsp; There are, in fact, conflicting decisions on whether withholding costs and interest charges are deductibles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Act also places unnecessary obstacles to applications.&nbsp; Right now, the Board is obliged to reject applications for technical non-compliance with the regulations even when there is no prejudice.&nbsp; In one case, an application was rejected when a notice was issued a day late.&nbsp; Time and cost are wasted.&nbsp; Different en-bloc applications involve different circumstances and throw up different issues.&nbsp; It is difficult to legislate for every situation.&nbsp; That is precisely why a rigid structure is likely to give rise to unjust results.&nbsp; What comes out is that the Act is not clear and certain enough and does not confer enough discretionary power on the Strata Titles Board, a fact which the Board itself has observed in its decisions.&nbsp; If the purpose of the Act is to facilitate en-bloc sales and, at the same time, ensure that owners are treated fairly, then it should make sense to confer more discretionary powers on the Board to ensure that justice is done in each case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, our Government has announced that Singapore has the capacity to accommodate 6.5 million people. This means that more land will be allocated for construction of residential property.&nbsp; Currently, we are witnessing an increasing trend of en-bloc sale of private properties for redevelopment.&nbsp; For the majority, they will be more than glad if the en-bloc sales will yield high returns and capital gains. But for the minority, no amount of compensation can make up for the permanent loss of their cosy nests; money is not able to substitute for this loss because they have had many sweet and fond memories in the house. Therefore, it is not fair to force the minority to comply with the mandatory 80% agreement by which we decide on whether an en-bloc sale proceeds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In this regard, I would like to ask the Government whether it will consider revising the law so that the minority is protected under the law, especially for the elderly living alone, those having difficulty getting about, or the feeble and weak. They are the ones who are likely to lose out and they face uncertainty because they are not familiar with the new environment, and they will hesitate and panic. Also, they feel helpless under tremendous pressure from the property agents. Therefore, I hope that the Government, before approving more en-bloc sales, will make the necessary arrangements to ensure that the minority rights are protected.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Personal bankruptcy is a social stigma, and has caused much family distortion and hardship.&nbsp; A large number of these bankrupts are Singaporeans who failed to pay their debts amounting to less than $100,000.&nbsp; The key reasons attributing to their bankruptcies include over-indulgence in&nbsp;expenses, poor management of finances, business failures or personal crises.&nbsp; Many of these ill-informed Singaporeans have over-committed themselves financially in housing loans, renovation loans, car loans, credit card facilities, hire purchase arrangements or dubious timeshare investments.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they face financial difficulties to service their loans, they will fall into \"debt traps\" where their creditors will impose high interest charges, high late penalty fees, high legal fees or administrative fees.&nbsp; As a result of these debt traps, the debtors will find it extremely difficult to repay their debts, thus, finally facing bankruptcy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I understand that the Ministry has reviewed the Bankruptcy Act to permit earlier discharge of bankrupts.&nbsp; But more can be done to prevent Singaporeans from getting into bankruptcy.&nbsp; As long as we continue to practise <I>caveat emptor</I>, there will always be consumers who will be persuaded to over-commit themselves financially and become potential victims of debt traps or bankruptcy.&nbsp; In order to protect the interests of the creditors, bankrupts and potential bankrupts, we should review the bankruptcy regime in Singapore.&nbsp; More can be done to prevent bankruptcy, especially in the areas of public education, pre-bankruptcy measures, and bankruptcy discharge incentives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In cases where debts are incurred and bankruptcy petitions are filed, the Ministry should intervene through mediation or a repayment arrangement before the court hearing.&nbsp; I wish to ask the Ministry the following questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; What measures are in place to prevent bankruptcy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; How can the Ministry incentivise bankrupts to have an earlier discharge?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar:</B> Sir, when I was a junior lawyer,&nbsp;a judge I appeared before, since retired, described bankruptcy like this.&nbsp; He said, \"When you die, your body remains on earth and your soul goes to heaven.&nbsp; When you are bankrupt, you keep your body but your soul goes to the Official Assignee's Office.\"&nbsp; The point made is that bankruptcy is a serious matter involving the forfeiture of a person's legal rights.&nbsp; A bankrupt loses his right to manage his affairs and he faces many restrictions, including his ability to travel.&nbsp; Over and above the legal restrictions, there is a strong social stigma.&nbsp; Employers are often reluctant to hire bankrupts, which only aggravates their financial problems.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bankruptcy is usually for a minimum of three years.&nbsp; By the time a bankrupt gets back on his feet, he may have lost a large part of his best working years.&nbsp; Many are bankrupt because of unfortunate circumstances or poor financial management.&nbsp; They are not dishonest people.&nbsp; The problem is that where a person cannot pay his debts, there is really little alternative to bankruptcy.&nbsp; Creditors, particularly financial institutions, are required to take reasonable steps to recover the debt before they can write it off.&nbsp; Often, this means bankrupting a debtor, even if there is little hope of recovery.&nbsp; Creditors also do not know if the bankrupt is hiding assets and hope that these will surface during the bankruptcy administration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bankruptcy threshold is now $10,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;The law, therefore, makes no distinction between a person who owes $10,000 and one who owes a million dollars.&nbsp; Surely, many can be saved from bankruptcy by way of a sensible debt repayment plan.&nbsp; Debtors have an avenue of proposing a voluntary arrangement, but this involves engaging a professional to supervise its implementation, which is really beyond most.&nbsp; In any event, this arrangement will only be approved by the courts if it is supported by a majority in the number of creditors and at least three-fourths in value.&nbsp; This is difficult to achieve.&nbsp; Sometimes, creditors have no idea about the debtors' true worth and whether the proposal is a genuine one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, hope that the bankruptcy regime will be refined so that most debtors have a real chance to get their life back together.&nbsp; All that most creditors really require is that the debtors' circumstances be properly evaluated and there is a genuine plan to repay his debts.&nbsp; So I call on the Government to facilitate this compromise between the debtor and the creditor to reduce the number of bankruptcies in Singapore and to ensure that no party is prejudiced.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Ser Luck-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Essentially, there are two issues.&nbsp; The first is how to avoid entrepreneurs from being rushed into bankruptcy.&nbsp; And, second, when they are already bankrupt, how to make it easier to rehabilitate and facilitate their quick entry into the economic life?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I had suggested that we consider the US model which is a dual-track model of Chapters 7 and 13 for individual bankruptcy.&nbsp; Under Chapter 7 of the US Bankruptcy Code, an insolvent person can apply to put himself into bankruptcy if he cannot pay his debt.&nbsp; He is subsequently also counselled as a consequence of a bankruptcy under Chapter 7 on the effect of his credit history.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this section, he will also be told of the alternatives under Chapter 13, in which he has to continue to pay his creditors or reaching a private settlement to avoid bankruptcy. Under&nbsp;Chapter 13, there is no wiping clean of the slate but neither is there the stigma of being a bankrupt. This is a good system for us to follow here in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, one particular example of how harsh the regime here is is the case of bankrupts who leave Singapore. As Minister Prof. Jayakumar said in the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill debate on 25th August 1994 in this House, the intention of the OA is not to prevent every Singaporean bankrupt from travelling.&nbsp; Yet, we still have many bankrupts who do not apply to go overseas because they have difficulties in getting approval.&nbsp; Many of these persons get hauled&nbsp;up before the courts and face criminal sanction under the Bankruptcy Act, section 131, where the Act punishes them with either a $10,000 fine or a jail term of two years. But, unfortunately, we had a precedent set by the former Chief Justice where, under the case of Public Prosecutor<I>&nbsp;vs</I> Zhong Tian Hao, he decided that punishment for this offence should be a jail term.&nbsp; And subsequently, the Subordinate Courts are bound by this precedent.&nbsp; I am not a lawyer, but I think they are bound by this precedent set by the High Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the courts should not be playing the role of Parliament and I hope that the Minister can explain this. I suggest that the Minister look at Chapters 7 and&nbsp;13 and also the harshness of this rule to be reduced.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Ms Lim, you have two cuts.

Once a young person turns 21, parents cannot by law make decisions on his or her behalf.&nbsp; The 21-year-old can sign contracts and vote in a public election.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we require those under 21 to engage in some very serious undertakings already.&nbsp; Boys are enlisted into National Service at 18 years, required to carry weapons and may have to defend Singapore with their lives.&nbsp; If a young adult above 18 commits a capital crime, he will be hanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, even within the Singapore context itself, there seems to be anomalies about whether we consider those between 18 and 21 years&nbsp;as adults or not.&nbsp; What have other countries done?&nbsp; Since World War II, the majority of countries have lowered their ages of majority and voting from 21 to 18. Even many Asian countries use 18 as the voting age, including China, India, Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines. We are one of the remaining few using 21.&nbsp; Are our young people somehow less mature than their peers elsewhere?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In respect of voting, one compelling argument relates to compulsory military service.&nbsp; The United States went through this experience in the 1970s.&nbsp; Young men under 21 were drafted to fight in Vietnam. The public sentiment there was basically that if they were old enough to do that, they should be old enough to vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; Sir, if young Singaporeans aged between 18 and 21 years are entitled to vote, I believe that this would have a tsunami effect in making them interested in national affairs which in turn will make our national debate more holistic and inclusive.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Criminal Procedure</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to address two aspects of criminal procedures. The first is disclosure of evidence before trial and, secondly, appeals against sentence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, there was no requirement for the prosecution and the defence to disclose evidence to each other in the stages before the trial itself.&nbsp; This was not conducive to a fair result and contrasts sharply with civil cases where there is a process called discovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime in October 2006, the Ministry of Law announced that they had finally agreed to a framework on pre-trial exchange of evidence. While this is certainly welcome, the MinLaw spokesman clarified that the framework would require the prosecution to disclose only the evidence it intended to use against the accused. Thus, evidence gathered by the police which they did not intend to use in the case would not be revealed to the defence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe this would be&nbsp;a shortcoming with the potential to perpetuate injustice.&nbsp; Evidence gathered by the police is very valuable.&nbsp; First, the police are often the first ones at the crime scene. The evidence and witness reactions then are contemporaneous with the crime and likely to be reliable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the police have powers to compel witnesses to come to assist investigations.&nbsp; In contrast, the defence has no special powers to investigate cases.&nbsp; The lawyer is also brought in after police investigations have concluded, sometimes several weeks later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, United Kingdom law requires the prosecution to reveal evidence they have gathered even if they do not intend to use it, for example, witnesses who may strengthen the defence's case.&nbsp; This is seen as essential to a fair trial as the desired outcome of any investigation is to arrive as close as possible to the truth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MinLaw has stated that if all the information gathered by the police had to be revealed, then the public cannot provide important information to the police in confidence and this may compromise the investigations. To me, there is a higher cost in wrongful convictions by the suppression of evidence helpful to the accused.&nbsp; To balance things out, we could consider allowing the prosecution to get a court order not to disclose any statement if there are special public interest concerns.&nbsp; And I believe it is the UK model.&nbsp; Could the Ministry relook at this issue?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Sir, appeals against sentences.&nbsp; Both the prosecution and the accused can appeal against a sentence. The prosecution will appeal if it considers the sentence to be too light and, conversely, the accused may appeal if he feels his sentence is too harsh.&nbsp; Under the current law, if there is an appeal against a sentence by either party, the judge hearing an appeal can either reduce or enhance the sentence or alter the nature of the sentence.&nbsp; This has led to many cases in the past where the accused appeals against a sentence which instead becomes harsher. Such risks have led people not exercising their right of appeal for fear that their sentences would be enhanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if we pride ourselves in the quality of our judicial system, then we must ensure that nobody fears exercising their rights of appeal.&nbsp; Accordingly, my suggestion is that the Ministry consider amending section 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code and that the section should provide that when an accused appeals against a sentence, the court may only reduce the sentence or retain the same sentence.&nbsp; If there is a concern that the sentence was too light, the Attorney-General's Chambers would still have the right to appeal to enhance the sentence.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law (Prof. S Jayakumar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law (Prof. S Jayakumar):</B> Sir, I thank the Members who have spoken on the Ministry&nbsp;of Law.&nbsp; I would respond to the comments made on legal aid, en-bloc sales and also Ms Sylvia Lim's questions on age of majority and my colleague, the Senior Minister of State, Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee, will respond to the remaining points.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on legal aid.&nbsp; The thrust of what the Members have said is whether the Legal Aid Bureau can do more and&nbsp;whether the Ministry can do more.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to answer that straightaway by saying, yes, we will endeavour to do more and we will do it in three ways.&nbsp; One is through adjustments to the means test. Second is through giving some discretion to the Director of Legal Aid.&nbsp; And third is through a partnership with the Law Society of Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will elaborate on each of these.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, relating to the means test,&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua and others have asked whether the means test has been too harsh. The answer is really that the position is not that bad because before we adjusted the means test in 2001, about 70% of the applicants qualified.&nbsp; When we adjusted the means test in 2001, some 89% to 90% of the applicants qualified.&nbsp; I was asked to provide&nbsp;figures.&nbsp; Last year, 9,696 cases were registered, about 89% qualified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will say that it is only a small&nbsp;handful of applicants who do not qualify. After the 2001 revision, the qualifying monthly household income, say, for a family of four, taking into account their personal and dependants' deductibles, increased to about $1,900 - not the $850 figure that the GPC Chairman, Dr Teo Ho Pin, indicated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, nevertheless, I have asked my officials to review this&nbsp;last year and see how we can do more to assist the lower-income group and perhaps also some in the lower part of the middle income who may need&nbsp;legal assistance. So what we intend to do is to try to expand the coverage of the legal aid, from the current 30th percentile to the 40th percentile of households based on household income.&nbsp; How do we intend to do this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We will first increase the personal deductibles from $3,000 to $4,500 and for the dependants' deductibles, we will increase it from $2,000 to $3,500.&nbsp; At the same time, we will also align the disposable capital limit from $7,000 to $10,000 to match the qualifying disposable income limit. With these changes, we believe that we will be able to increase the coverage to up to the 40th percentile.&nbsp; And with these changes, the qualifying monthly household income for a family of four will increase from $1,900 to $2,600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second change we intend to do, and this relates to what Mr Hri Kumar mentioned, is the question of discretion.&nbsp; Yes, we realise that even after the changes of means test, there may be some cases which do not satisfy the means test, but because of the circumstances of the case, may, nevertheless, be deserving of help. So what we will do is for the Director of Legal Aid Bureau to be given greater discretion to offer help to those who are facing such specific hardships, for example, someone who may not have met the means test but suddenly has lost his job, requires urgent help or someone who has suddenly physical or mental incapacity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we intend to establish legal clinics, and this relates to the point by Dr Teo Ho Pin on outreach. We cannot be everywhere in Singapore but what we intend to do is to set up, on a trial basis,&nbsp;legal clinics which will not be providing full-fledged legal aid, but, rather, basic legal advice and information&nbsp;where members of the public can go to as first-stops to get&nbsp;basic information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have discussed this with the Mayors and they have expressed support and enthusiasm and we intend to launch a pilot project starting with, say,&nbsp;two legal clinics.&nbsp; We will discuss this further with the Mayors as to the ideal location for this, either at the CDC or at the community centre.&nbsp; And if it works out well, then we may try to expand to have more&nbsp;clinics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend&nbsp;to partner with the Law Society.&nbsp; The Law Society of Singapore has, separately on its own, done a study on legal aid and&nbsp; <I>pro bono</I> work.&nbsp; One of the main recommendations is for practising lawyer to do 25 hours of <I>pro bono</I> work annually.&nbsp; I think the Law Society's proposal is commendable.&nbsp; In fact, as I have said before, the Law Society is doing good work, not only with the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme&nbsp;- CLAS -&nbsp;but also with the volunteers who work with the Legal Aid Bureau.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have discussed this with the President of the Law Society as well as the Co-Chairmen of their study team. They have expressed support for the changes which I outlined just now and they want to work with us. We will therefore partner with the Law Society to encourage more lawyers to volunteer <I>pro bono</I> &nbsp;services at the Legal Aid Bureau as well as at the proposed legal clinics. We are now working out the operational aspects of such collaboration and we hope that the first clinic can be set up some time in the second part of this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some other specific questions were asked, for example, whether some of the criminal cases can be dealt with.&nbsp; I have explained in this House before&nbsp;the approach the Government takes&nbsp;for civil legal aid,&nbsp;for capital cases, and&nbsp;that the Law Society of Singapore handles the&nbsp;Criminal Legal Aid&nbsp;Scheme. But with the clinics that we have in mind, if the Member Ms Ellen Lee is talking about minor regulatory offences and&nbsp;people do not know where to turn to, I think we can consider this under the proposed legal clinics.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was asked how long the Legal Aid Bureau would take to successfully complete the cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to measure this for any particular year, because in some cases, the applicant may not have given all the information.&nbsp; They may have to come several times, as&nbsp;they may not have given all the documentation, all the facts.&nbsp; It depends on the cooperation of the other party, if it is a contested matter, and so on.&nbsp; But I would say that if we take divorce cases, in 2006, the average time taken for the Legal Aid Bureau to complete a case was about 20 months.&nbsp; Sir, on the whole, I think that the Legal Aid Bureau will&nbsp;take into account the points made by the Members.&nbsp; We have these changes and&nbsp;let us&nbsp;see how we can progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On en bloc sale, this is a topic very much in the news recently and much feedback has been received, including those voiced by the Members who&nbsp;spoke on this.&nbsp; Last year, I appointed a study team to look into the&nbsp;en bloc sale process and the laws, and they have made a number of recommendations.&nbsp; I have also had several sessions of discussions with the President of the Strata Titles Boards&nbsp;and his&nbsp;three Deputy Presidents.&nbsp; We have discussed and they have agreed to the recommendations of the study team which I will now outline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, we have three areas of changes or proposals.&nbsp; The first concerns the method or process by which we decide on whether an en bloc sale can proceed.&nbsp; We will retain the basic approach.&nbsp; The basic approach is 80% or 90% majority vote based on share values&nbsp;depending&nbsp;on the age of the development, whether it is 10 years or more, or less than 10 years.&nbsp; We will retain that.&nbsp; But in addition to 80% or 90% of the share values, the proposal is that there must also be 80% or 90% majority vote of the total number of units in the development&nbsp; - in other words, share values as well as the number of units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For purely residential apartments, this will not be a problem because almost invariably 80% or 90% share values will also be 80% or 90% of the units.&nbsp; Why are we doing this?&nbsp; It is because it will address a problem which is particularly felt in mixed developments.&nbsp; There is unhappiness of residential unit owners in a mixed development who hold lesser share values despite owning a substantial floor area and substantial number of units.&nbsp; For example, in a mixed development, the residential units could be amounting to 60% of the total number of units but they have only 20% of the share values.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shopping complexes may have 40% of the units but they may have 80% of the share values.&nbsp; So the residents are out-voted.&nbsp; We therefore have this proposal for the majority of 80% or 90% to be also a percentage majority of the total number of units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we intend to give the Strata Titles Board&nbsp;a certain power to increase the sale proceeds in certain cases.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; This concerns the distribution of the sale proceeds.&nbsp; We will not change the basic approach for the distribution of the sale proceeds.&nbsp; The basic approach is that the majority owners in the en bloc process will still have to decide on the distribution method most&nbsp;suitable in their particular circumstances.&nbsp; The reason why we want to give this power to the Strata Titles Board is to address situations where the Strata Titles Board considers that a minority owner may not have been treated fairly or equitably in the distribution of the proceeds, although it may not be able to find any aspect of bad faith in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give Members an example.&nbsp; It is just an example.&nbsp; Say, a minority owner does $200,000 worth of renovation when there was no en bloc proposal in the air.&nbsp; And six months later, there is an en bloc proposal which becomes successful.&nbsp; In fact, it means that he has enjoyed his renovated unit only for about two years before having to move out.&nbsp; He really does not suffer a financial loss under&nbsp;the terms of the Act but the Strata Titles Board may, if they have this discretion,&nbsp;increase his&nbsp;sale proceeds by an amount&nbsp;which it considers fair if it considers it fair and equitable to do so in the circumstances.&nbsp; But there will be a cap on the amount that is available to the STB to award such extra amount, and the proposed cap will be an aggregate sum of $2,000 or 0.25% of the sale proceeds from each unit or whichever is higher.&nbsp; So there will be a certain sum with which they can exercise the discretion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third change we intend to do is for the Strata Titles Board to issue guidelines on the allowable expenditures; in other words, guidelines to improve the transparency of the process and for there to be greater openness by those who are spearheading the process.&nbsp; For example, the Strata Titles Board can issue guidelines on the allowable expenditure that will be taken into account in the evaluation of financial loss claims.&nbsp; This will provide more certainty to both majority and minority owners.&nbsp; I think this is a point raised by Mr Hri Kumar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next,&nbsp;if an en bloc process is initiated and if an en bloc committee is to be formed, we will provide that it should be done at an extraordinary general meeting convened by the management corporation.&nbsp; I think this will&nbsp;make for better accountability.&nbsp; It will provide for more certainty to both majority and minority owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take the point of many Members, including Ms Ellen Lee, who said there may be people in the minority who, for various reasons, do not want to sell.&nbsp; We considered all this at the time when we drafted the legislation.&nbsp; It is not an easy issue because there may be some who want to stay there for sentimental reasons; some who have sworn to their forefathers that they would live there forever; some like the <I>feng shui,</I> and a lot of other reasons.&nbsp; But it is not possible to craft legislation to accommodate all these views, because the only perfect solution is to go back to the old system which required unanimous agreement, but we decided to move away from that when Parliament decided to have the en bloc legislation so that there will not be&nbsp;unanimous requirement and a majority vote.&nbsp; Because, otherwise, we will not be able to either maximise land usage or to rejuvenate our buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the changes we have in mind.&nbsp; I hope they addressed some of the points raised by Members.&nbsp; We will do a public consultation on the proposed changes.&nbsp; We will get feedback and suggestions which we shall take into account before we finalise the amendments on en bloc sale legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on the points raised by Ms Sylvia Lim on the age of majority.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the age of majority in Singapore is actually not defined by statute.&nbsp; It is defined by common law which sets it at 21 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain what is the legislative approach that we have taken in Singapore.&nbsp; We have, in our body of laws,&nbsp;different laws to&nbsp;prescribe different ages for qualifications, requirements, disqualifications for a whole host of different contexts, purposes, status or objectives, whether it is for driving licence or for voting in elections.&nbsp; This is because each activity calls for different considerations.&nbsp; For example, the law provides the age of 21 for qualification for membership of Parliament, for entering certain professions, like lawyers, public accountants, engineers, or to be eligible to be a guarantor, or to marry without parents' consent, or to make a valid will.&nbsp; These are some examples for the age of 21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we have&nbsp;laws that prescribe the age of 18 to get a driving licence, to buy cigarettes or alcohol, and so on.&nbsp; The point I want to make is that there is no single threshold age for all purposes.&nbsp; I guess it&nbsp;is because&nbsp;we cannot say adulthood is gained overnight on a fixed birthday, whether it is 21 or earlier.&nbsp; Rather it is attained through a gradual process.&nbsp; The approach that our laws have is a pragmatic one where there is a gradual increase in rights and responsibilities leading up to the age of 21, at which stage nearly all the limitations linked to&nbsp;age are removed.&nbsp; But this does not mean that everything is cast in stone and no aspect of this variegated&nbsp;approach will be ever reviewed.&nbsp; Whilst we have no immediate plans to reduce the age of majority, we are currently reviewing the matter for some specific areas impacting on our drive, for example, to create greater entrepreneurial skills and a risk taking approach, especially for our young.&nbsp; For example, the Government is looking into whether those who are at least 18 years of age can more freely enter into contracts, but this is just an example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On voting age, we do not intend to change that.&nbsp; Sir, voting in parliamentary elections or voting in election for the Presidency is a very serious matter.&nbsp; It is a decision where voters choose their MP and choose, in turn, which political party or parties&nbsp;form&nbsp;the government to look after and run the country.&nbsp; In the case of elections for the elected President, voters will be deciding on which individual&nbsp;they will entrust to hold the office of President to exercise the custodial&nbsp;and veto powers set out in the Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if we set the age below 21, many would still be studying and, in the case of males, would still be doing National Service, or they would have just started work.&nbsp; The current age of 21 means that the voter would have finished National Service and many others would have had some working experience.&nbsp; I think they would then be in a better position to make careful assessments, considered judgments about the quality of the candidates and of other many national issues involved when it comes to forming a judgment and choice involved in casting votes.&nbsp; Sir, I think our model of elections and government has worked well, and I see no pressing reason to change it, including the age of voting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I note the experience in other countries, as pointed out by Ms Sylvia Lim.&nbsp; The practice varies and there are also examples of other countries which have kept to a higher age.&nbsp; Malaysia retains the age of 21.&nbsp; Japan has the age at 20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will ask my colleague, Assoc.

Indeed, IPTO has taken some steps towards that because for several years now, IPTO has been running a pre-bankruptcy advisory and mediation centre to advise persons in danger of becoming insolvent of the options that are available.&nbsp;Last year, this service helped 1,200 debtors.&nbsp; But, here, it is up to the parties to agree to come for mediation, in other words,&nbsp;the creditors and the debtors&nbsp;come and talk and agree on debt agreement. So&nbsp;it is really voluntary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 12 such cases were mediated and four were successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are early efforts. So what more can be done?&nbsp; I think that is the key query that Members have asked.&nbsp; Indeed, we will do more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are doing now is to follow through on what we had&nbsp;said last year at COS, and it is a natural follow through to what IPTO's efforts have&nbsp;amounted to&nbsp;in terms of mediation. Because, last year, we said that we would consider implementing a repayment scheme to help wage earner debtors, with relatively small unsecured debts, avoid bankruptcy and&nbsp;that we would consult key stakeholders on its feasibility.&nbsp; We&nbsp;have been doing this for the past several months consulting the Association of Banks, its members, insolvency practitioners and lawyers,&nbsp;I am happy to say that there is general support for this scheme which we will call the Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS).&nbsp;&nbsp;DRS will differ from the Voluntary Arrangement Scheme (VAS) which is already available currently.&nbsp; I think Mr Hri Kumar mentioned that and indeed, he is right - the VAS has its&nbsp;limitations.&nbsp; It is court based and all the parties must agree, the creditor agreement must be sought and it can be costly and&nbsp;protracted.&nbsp; So what we want to do is especially for consumer wage earner debtors.&nbsp; What can we do to help them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The VAS may be more applicable to businesses and partnerships.&nbsp; Now this new DRS scheme that we are introducing is&nbsp;modelled after Chapter 13 of the US Bankruptcy Code, which I think Mr Inderjit Singh has mentioned.&nbsp; So the Official Assignee (OA) has looked at it and&nbsp;found some good features which we are adapting.&nbsp; It will benefit debtors who are working and whose debts do not exceed $100,000.&nbsp; Based on last year's figures, this would have covered some 1,863 or 62% of the debtors who were made bankrupt.&nbsp; And a majority of&nbsp;these would be wage earner consumer debtors who are facing temporary cashflow problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the DRS, debtors would have a&nbsp;chance to work out a repayment plan, formulated and implemented under the supervision of an administrator, to be completed within the maximum period of five years.&nbsp; Although the repayment plan will not be voted upon by the creditors, the administrator will have to ensure that creditors' rights are not compromised, ie, that they will receive no less than if the debtor had been made bankrupt.&nbsp; When the debtor completes the plan, he will be released from his debts thus avoiding bankruptcy.&nbsp; If the debtor is dishonest or fails to cooperate with the administrator, the administrator can declare that the plan has failed upon which any creditor may then make the debtor a bankrupt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the DRS is principally intended to help wage earner debtors who have a regular source of income to repay some or all of the debts,&nbsp;IPTO will be flexible. Deserving debtors who, for example,&nbsp;may be in-between jobs and therefore&nbsp;currently not earning wages can also take advantage of the scheme.&nbsp; To keep it simple, DRS, like I said just now, will apply for a start only to individual debtors and will not be available to businesses or partnerships.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this scheme, I think more can avoid bankruptcy. But the essence of this scheme is really one of&nbsp;self-help.&nbsp; The debtor must realise that this is an opportunity to avert bankruptcy, so he must cooperate with the administrator and show good faith to ensure that he complies with the terms of the repayment plan.&nbsp; MinLaw will issue a consultation paper and after that we will refine it based on the feedback received.&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to amend the Bankruptcy Act before the end of the year to bring the scheme into effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Teo Ser Luck asked whether this will result in IPTO being inundated with more work.&nbsp; I think IPTO will have to adjust and see whether it can cope,&nbsp;for a start.&nbsp;But, of course, we will review its manpower requirements, and I am sure they will ask for help from HQ if need be. But the point is to&nbsp;give the scheme a good start - support it.&nbsp; I am sure bankrupts will indeed be helped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Dr Teo and Mr Hri Kumar asked&nbsp;how we can expedite or incentivise bankrupts to work towards a discharge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, our bankruptcy regime strives to strike the right balance,&nbsp;in other words, the creditors' interest to recover as much of the&nbsp;debt as possible and also the debtor's interest to give him a reprieve from his debts and a&nbsp;fresh start in his financial matters.&nbsp; So the key to this still is that the bankrupt must be cooperative and cooperate with the OA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, OA has indeed implemented several measures to help bankrupts who are already in the regime to get out of bankruptcy.&nbsp; First,&nbsp;Members who are in the House&nbsp;earlier will know that in 1995, we introduced a discharge by Certificate of OA Scheme whereby starting at the time with debts up to $100,000, after a certain number of years, the OA can&nbsp;discharge the bankrupt.&nbsp;&nbsp;This ceiling has been raised and currently stands at half a million dollars.&nbsp; Also, the OA&nbsp;categorises bankrupts who cooperate with its office and contribute regularly to the bankruptcy estate in the green zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bankrupts in this zone generally will receive approval to travel overseas or act as directors or manage a business.&nbsp; So that is encouraging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh asked why bankrupts who travel overseas without the OA's consent are jailed, instead of being fined and&nbsp;he referred to a&nbsp;court decision.&nbsp; First of all, let me say that requiring&nbsp; a bankrupt to seek the approval of the OA before he travels is not new to Singapore.&nbsp; It is not only so in Singapore because other regimes also have this requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the rationale is quite clear.&nbsp; Because unauthorised travel can enable the bankrupt and put him in a position either to hide assets or dispose of assets and also make it difficult for the OA to administer the estate.&nbsp; He needs the OA's permission&nbsp;before he travels but the good news is that last year, 33,000 bankrupts applied for approval to travel and about&nbsp;30,500&nbsp;(or 91%) were granted approval.&nbsp; But the other point is, why are they jailed?&nbsp; This is a court decision, but let me just say that they are not all jailed because, in fact, the Act allows for a person to be either jailed or fined.&nbsp; So I would say that we should leave it&nbsp;to the court to look at the facts and circumstances of the case because every case is unique&nbsp;- whether he has travelled before, how long he stays away, whether he is a cooperative bankrupt, whether he has other offences hanging over his head. That is why I think we should leave it to the court.&nbsp; My assurance to Mr Singh is that there are cases where the bankrupt is only fined and not jailed.&nbsp; So it is not mandatory jail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for the&nbsp;remaining time, I will address Ms Lim's points.&nbsp;I think she is quite anxious.&nbsp;First of all, she is right.&nbsp; We have already announced that&nbsp;when we&nbsp;amend the CPC, we&nbsp;will look at formalising a framework that is already in place. And indeed over the years, both in the Subordinate Court and the High Court&nbsp;-&nbsp;Subordinate Court with the Pre-Trial Conference (PTC), and High Court with Preliminary Inquiry processes - both defence and accused person have been put in a position where more information has been exchanged.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is medical records, list of witnesses or adducing statements that the prosecution will use in the case, these can be made available through these processes.&nbsp; So what we are doing now is that we are looking at the CPC and reviewing it and we will formalise this process.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments are now being framed.&nbsp; Basically, there will be a statutory framework where the prosecution would formally inform the defence of his case against the accused.&nbsp; This will include the list of witnesses and&nbsp;statements of accused to be adduced by the prosecution. But&nbsp;Ms Lim asked: how about witnesses' statements?&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we must have taken care here.&nbsp; In fact, she herself addressed the nub of the issue because when you do that, that may inhibit people from coming forward to assist police in investigations and we do rely on publicly assisted crimes being solved.&nbsp; So if witnesses know that their statements given in the course of police investigations may then be disclosed to the accused person, that may inhibit them from coming forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, some of&nbsp;this information may, in fact, be sensitive because if it is made available to the defence counsel and it is out there, it may result in evidence being tampered with or destroyed.&nbsp; So I think we should not tamper with the system that has worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ms Lim is still not happy, when we have the consultation and we will have a consultation on this including&nbsp;probably a public consultation, she can put in her views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point that she mentioned was&nbsp;on the High Court.&nbsp; When the High Court hears Magistrate appeals from the Subordinate Court, and when an accused person appeals on sentence wanting to reduce it, why should the High Court have the powers which it currently has to instead raise the sentence?&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should leave it to the court to decide what is the right punishment in the entire circumstances of the case. Because when the court's powers are invoked to look at the sentence and if indeed it feels, after&nbsp;looking at all the circumstances of the case, that the sentence is inadequate, then I think we should not circumscribe its powers to enhance the sentence.&nbsp; But having said this, let me assure Ms Lim and others in the House that, in fact, last year, of the Magistrate appeals that went up to the High Court, there were only six cases where sentences were enhanced compared to 85 cases where sentences were either affirmed or reduced.&nbsp; And of these six cases, only two of&nbsp;the accused persons&nbsp;lodged the appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two out of more than 90 cases&nbsp;is a very small percentage.&nbsp; So let us not get carried away.&nbsp; I think it is right for the court to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the court&nbsp;is very careful, as it always,&nbsp;in enhancing a sentence.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</B> Sir, I just want to make some clarifications based on&nbsp;the answers by the Ministers.&nbsp;First,&nbsp;on the legal clinic,&nbsp;I just want to know what is the funding allocated to conduct the two trial&nbsp;legal clinics.&nbsp; Second,&nbsp;on the amendments to the en-bloc sale&nbsp;procedures,&nbsp;when is the effective date and&nbsp;can the Ministry also provide an SOP to facilitate en-bloc sales so that the agents and the&nbsp;Management Corporation can follow that procedures?&nbsp;And, third, in terms of public education to prevent bankruptcy, are there any specific programmes which are conducted at the community level to increase the knowledge of Singaporeans to avoid bankruptcy?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Jayakumar:</B> Sir, let me answer the two points on legal clinics and en-bloc sales.&nbsp; On funding, I guess the Chairman of the GPC is wondering whether there will be an&nbsp; imposition on the CDC if the CDC partners with the legal clinics.&nbsp; Let me assure him that&nbsp;we want to partner the CDC&nbsp;but we will endeavour to have as little&nbsp;financial imposition&nbsp;on the CDC as possible.&nbsp;What we will be grateful for is if we can use part of the CDC premises for the legal clinic.&nbsp; Other detailed aspects of funding will be worked out later.&nbsp; I think the Ministry of Law will be able to give some funding for this and the Academy of Law is also willing to assist.&nbsp;Basically, the collaboration with the Mayors and the CDCs, if the CDCs are used, will be in the use of a&nbsp;convenient location, and I think it will be helpful because many people go to the CDC for assistance which may have financial and&nbsp;legal&nbsp;implications.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On en-bloc sale, I am unable to give&nbsp;the Member&nbsp;a clear date as of now because we plan to go for public consultations.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only after&nbsp;the public consultations when we evaluate the responses and the feedback, then we will finalise.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Sir,&nbsp;the key question is really financial prudence.&nbsp; I think the message out there is that we take personal responsibility for how we spend.&nbsp; Indeed, Dr Teo is right because the large majority of the cases that go bankrupt are credit related - credit cards, credit facilities.&nbsp; So the general education must be, and all of us Singaporeans will know, that when you become a bankrupt there will be disabilities and inconvenience.&nbsp; So that is the part where there is a deterrence.&nbsp; But how to generally manage one's own finance so that one will not get into trouble - I think that is something which&nbsp;is not for the Government or IPTO to do.&nbsp; But I would agree that these are talks that should be organised on the ground and, indeed, I think all of us who are on the ground and&nbsp;who want to reach out to residents, can do so, and the residents will find it very interesting.&nbsp; But on IPTO's part, IPTO will continue to run public seminars for which Singaporeans&nbsp;are invited.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar:</B> Sir, two points.&nbsp; First, taking from Mr Michael Palmer's point about moratorium in favour of the debtor, what happens in the bankruptcy proceedings is that once a person is declared a bankrupt, all further legal proceedings and executions against him are stayed?&nbsp; This is to ensure that no one creditor steals a march on the others.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may encounter a situation where some creditors are subject to the DRS scheme and because there is no stay of proceedings, any other creditor can then take up execution proceedings, for example, by garnishing the debtor's salary, and therefore stealing a march on the other creditors.&nbsp; Would that situation be addressed?&nbsp; That is the first question.&nbsp; The second&nbsp;question is on the release of statements made by the accused.&nbsp; There is a danger of releasing some, but not all, statements.&nbsp; One of the criticisms often made in court, or in the argument about statements, is that the accused did not say one thing or another in that statement, or he did not, at the first available opportunity, raise a particular defence or fact to the Police.&nbsp; But it is unsafe then to make that argument because you do not have all the statements made by the accused. So what assurance will the public have&nbsp;when an argument is made that the accused did not say any particular thing in the statement,&nbsp;that he may not have said that thing in other statements he has made?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

In other words, it should not be the case where, if the DRS scheme kicks in, some creditors would get preference.&nbsp; I would expect him to then look at what is the list of creditors and ensure that he works with that list.&nbsp; That is the first point.&nbsp; The second point is, like I have said, the CPC amendments would formalise the framework, which currently is in place, which is basically fair because, in a sense, it is like both sides coming together, there is mutual discovery.&nbsp; You show me your case, I show you my case.&nbsp; So, here, the prosecution would be&nbsp;required to&nbsp;make available&nbsp;statements which he will rely on to substantiate his case.&nbsp; I think any witness who has made a statement, assuming he is an honest witness and particularly the accused person, will know what he has said.&nbsp; This current process is one that will serve the public interest because if, in court, he makes&nbsp;a statement which is inconsistent with what he had said earlier on, then, indeed, the statement can be introduced with the leave of the court to show that, no, this is not what he has said.&nbsp; But I would say, whilst we are working out the CPC review, let us wait for the details to be out and, like I said, there will be&nbsp;public consultation. So,&nbsp;at that stage, when the scheme is clear, we can consider all these points.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That the total sum to be allocated for Head P of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the recent series of letter bombs in London, the use of truck bombs filled with chemicals in Iraq, and the infiltration of terrorists into civilian organisations, such as university campuses, have raised new security threats.&nbsp; It shows that terrorism is very much alive and has adopted new tactics to cause harm to more innocent people.&nbsp; As a small country with limited resources, Singapore has no choice but to adopt a risk-based approach in our anti-terrorism measures.&nbsp; Therefore, we must always stay vigilant and respond appropriately to these new security threats so as to safeguard our people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to fight terrorism effectively, we need the full commitment of all our stakeholders in our society, ie, the Government, business and people sectors.&nbsp; From my GPC visits to the Home Team divisions, I am confident that the Home Team has made good progress in equipping themselves with the appropriate technology, manpower and systems in countering terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My concerns, however, lie with the readiness of our business and people sectors in preventing and responding to terrorist attacks.&nbsp; Although the Home Team has been working closely with the business community, such as hotels and transport companies, to boost up the security measures of hotels and transport, many office and retail establishments do not have much anti-terrorism measures in place.&nbsp; In fact, many office buildings in the business district are soft targets of terrorist attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, a truck carrying a bomb with chemical gas can easily drive into any of the tall office buildings in Shenton Way without much problem.&nbsp; This would have caused much damage to the building and its surrounding buildings, resulting in the loss of many lives.&nbsp; The recent liberalisation of postal services may also open doors to potential security threats,&nbsp;as letter bombs can be sent en mass to office buildings to cause severe destruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many Singaporeans have become over-confident and complacent that the Government will be able to handle terrorism effectively.&nbsp; Thus, many have not taken any interest in preparing themselves to respond appropriately in times of terrorist attacks or emergencies.&nbsp; The distribution of ready bags or emergency handbooks will be useless if Singaporeans do not have the knowledge and skills to apply them during emergencies.&nbsp; Many exhibitions, road shows and talks are ad hoc and token in nature.&nbsp; These merely increase awareness and will not prepare Singaporeans to respond to emergencies effectively.&nbsp; Like any skills, emergency preparedness skills must be properly taught and practised regularly in order to be useful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, the Home Team conducted Exercise North Star V to test the emergency preparedness of our various stakeholders in responding to terrorist attacks.&nbsp; I am not sure whether the exercise has achieved its stated objectives, and what lessons were learnt from that exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; What are the anti-terrorism measures taken by the Ministry to cope with new terrorist threats?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; What are the lessons learnt from North Star V and how many more public emergency exercises will be conducted this year?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;

We even have armed soldiers in uniform patrolling Changi Airport.&nbsp; Some people have said that we are over-reacting, but I do not think so.&nbsp; Up until the 11th September 2001 attacks on New York were deemed almost implausible and far-fetched, much less using American planes.&nbsp; And closer to home, so was Bali, catching many unprepared.&nbsp; These days, it is common fodder on the news to hear of terrorist attacks and bomb explosions here and there.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must accept that terrorist attacks can strike at any time, anywhere and in any form.&nbsp; Singapore is too good a target not to take aim at.&nbsp; Being a successful small island-state, a busy port and a financial centre, it makes us a juicy target.&nbsp; We cannot afford to slack in our level of preparedness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A terrorist attack may still take place despite our best efforts.&nbsp; We need to explore all avenues and prepare the general public for an eventuality of a terrorist attack.&nbsp; Our community may have been subjected to exercises and scenarios in the event of a conventional terrorist attack, such as a bomb explosion in crowded areas like a bus interchange or an MRT station.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We often see traffic that builds up outside our schools by our parents who are waiting to pick up their children.&nbsp; It has also struck me that, if I were a terrorist attacking a school in Singapore, it would certainly make front-page news.&nbsp; No one expected the Beslan incident to happen, but it did.&nbsp; In engaging our wider community, we might want to consider starting first with engaging over half a million or so of our school children and their parents.&nbsp; Total Defence Day type of activities is a start, but we can do more.&nbsp; I would leave the imagination to Members what effects such an attack would have on our schools and&nbsp;society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, although we have carried out many emergency preparedness exercises, I am uncertain of the success of wanting to send a resounding message of preparedness to our people.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, we see the same usual faces at many of these emergency exercises, the same ones at the anti-dengue exercises and almost the same people would turn up at either mass exercises or fire drills, and so on.&nbsp; We need to go for a wider audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The American Red Cross categorised community preparedness in the event of a terrorist attack in the following five groups:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Head Scratcher - those who do not know where to get information;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Head in the Sand - those who think preparation is unimportant;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Head in the Clouds - those who mistakenly believe that they are ready;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Headset Crowd - those who are too busy to bother; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; Heady Unawareness - those who simply have no thought about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any of these groups' presence would spell disaster in the event of a terrorist attack.&nbsp; My point is that we should not be lulled into a false sense of security, as like the third group I mentioned, ie, the head-in-the-clouds type.&nbsp; We need to spare no effort in preparing ourselves.&nbsp; A resilient community is probably the best defence in the event of an attack.&nbsp; We need to go beyond the usual Emergency Preparedness exercises.&nbsp; We need to engage the wider community and bring the Head Scratcher, the Head in the Sand, the Headset Crowd as well as the Heady Unawareness types into awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, given the attack on transportation in London in 2005, our efforts to reach a wider public transport&nbsp;is important.&nbsp; I would suggest that we might like to use the mock-up of an MRT train cabin for passengers to walk through, to appreciate the realism of a bomb attack and a chemical attack.&nbsp; It can be interactive, coupled with video or learning aids.&nbsp; It can be helpful in preparing our public in familiarising themselves and, most importantly, to learn how to react, report and respond to such emergencies.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

One of the key factors contributing to our safety is our policy on the possession of firearms.&nbsp; Other than authorised personnel, the possession of firearms is strictly forbidden.&nbsp; In addition, we have a \"zero-tolerance stance towards firearms offences\", as our Minister said in this House last year.&nbsp; The Arms Offences Act prescribes heavy punishment, including the death penalty, for those convicted of trafficking in arms and committing or attempting to commit crimes with firearms.&nbsp; Yet, we still have cases of unlawful possession of firearms in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent example is the fatal shooting of a nightclub owner by the gunman dubbed the \"One-eyed Dragon\".&nbsp; In his testimony, he claimed that he had contacted a friend in Thailand who delivered a semi-automatic Beretta .22-calibre pistol to him in a Johor hotel for RM15,000.&nbsp; So the question is:&nbsp; how did he manage to bring it into Singapore undetected?&nbsp; Where are the vulnerable points in our screening systems?&nbsp; Naturally, the Minister will not be able to disclose this.&nbsp; But one cannot help but wonder if there are other weapons out there which have been smuggled in through similar means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, we have many metal detectors at the airport and every single piece of luggage is screened.&nbsp; One can extrapolate that it is very unlikely that the firearm entered our territory via this entry point.&nbsp; But what about our causeways and ferry checkpoints?&nbsp; Do we have sufficient checks over there?&nbsp; While the current system is effective and minimises delays and inconvenience to the average motorist and traveller, my concern is that it is not foolproof and may not be enough to prevent more illegal firearms and ammunition from entering our country.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unfortunate fact is that our stakes are much higher now.&nbsp; In addition to petty criminals, we have to guard against the growing threat of terrorists.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister about the measures or controls we have in place to further reduce the possibility of firearms being brought into Singapore.&nbsp; Do we have enough manpower to handle the increasing traffic flows at the causeway checkpoints?&nbsp; With the new Budget Terminal, second causeway and the increase in tourists which the IRs will bring, we can expect a lot of travel in and out of Singapore on a regular basis.&nbsp; We must therefore plan for how we will deal with this increase in traveller traffic.&nbsp; Therefore, my ultimate question is: are we investing enough in the latest technologies and in the training of the Home Team specialists to handle such modern screening and security equipment?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Some of the gold standards that are adhered to would include the chain of survival as well as the golden hour concepts.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our emergency ambulance service is essentially a single-tier system which operates from 14 different fire stations and also 24 fire posts throughout the island.&nbsp; In the day, we have 35 ambulances on the run and, at night, there are only 28 covering the whole island.&nbsp; We also have fast-response paramedics on motorcycles operating from 7.00 am to 10.00 pm daily.&nbsp; Our ambulance to population ratio is currently 1:105,000.&nbsp; The recommendation by the National Association of Emergency Medical Services Physicians is for one ambulance per 40,000 population, and this is to be doubled at peak operating hours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, my questions are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Are there plans for expansion and enhancement to the service to meet the demands of higher public expectations and improving the waiting times?&nbsp;

Many of these cases are theft-related offences and crimes involving young offenders.&nbsp; Last year, 3,645 youths were arrested mainly for offences, such as theft or rioting.&nbsp; This is an area of concern, as youngsters moving in groups tend to be bolder and do silly things of mischief or due to peer pressures.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The high number of cases in housebreaking, theft, robbery and snatch theft also reflects the lack of vigilance among Singaporeans.&nbsp; Many failed to take precautions to prevent crime,&nbsp;thus, providing opportunities for crimes to take place.&nbsp;

Their eagerness for companionship makes them vulnerable to friendly strangers with ulterior motives.&nbsp; I know of an elderly widow being cheated by an older man who withdrew her lifetime savings of $200,000. When arrested, he got her to withdraw her charge and then married her as an assurance that he would repay her money.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he was eyeing her only other asset, a three-room flat, but he disappeared when he failed to get it sold.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many of such crimes against unsuspecting elderly by strangers have been solved?&nbsp;&nbsp;Like my GPC Chairman has said, many of these cases, though, on the face of it, are cheating cases, are not being picked up by the police as such.&nbsp; Are the campaigns to raise the elderly persons' awareness effective?&nbsp;&nbsp;With the setting up of the elderly crime watch group, how many elderly persons actually have helped to prevent other elderly persons from bogus persons?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reports by the Singapore Police Force (SPF)&nbsp;showed that the crime rate of a list of index crimes had dropped in 2006 as compared to 2005. Does the drop in crime rate take into account the solving of crimes by the police (the clearance rate of investigation papers that have been put up, ie,&nbsp;those that have been solved and those where the accused persons/suspects remain at large)?&nbsp; What indices are being used to measure the rate of crime other than by comparing previous year's numbers?&nbsp; Should a safety index be set up instead of using a comparative rate of crimes per annum, especially after the casinos in the IRs are set up, as many people associate them with more crimes and, hence, less safety?&nbsp; Have illegal money-laundering activities and Internet crimes, eg,&nbsp;Internet gambling, dropped as a result of increased efforts and resources dedicated to curbing such activity?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Chapter 65A)&nbsp;has been promulgated&nbsp;to curb money-laundering activities in Singapore.&nbsp; How far has this served its purpose and what is the level of money-laundering activities in Singapore?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the Community Engagement Programme (CEP), is MHA enhancing efforts to engage private security agencies and in-house security personnel and the grassroots leaders to combat and reduce crime?

Sometimes, on one stretch of road, we can find about five to 10 types of road markings, such as single and double white lines, yellow solid and broken lines, red or zig-zag lines, yellow or white boxes, etc.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also find different speed limit signs displayed along the same road.&nbsp; If you drive along the PIE, you will find you have to switch from 90 kmh to 80 kmh at different points of the expressway and, thereafter, you have to change to 50 kmh when you filter out and change gear to&nbsp;60 kmh or 70 kmh on other roads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I understand that traffic rules are necessary to ensure road safety.&nbsp; But I think we have too many traffic rules on our roads. The vast number of traffic rule markings and signs on our roads has made it difficult for many motorists to comply.&nbsp; It is like a web of traps with the Traffic Police always ready to catch you flouting the rules.&nbsp; Each year, thousands of summonses were issued to motorists, and some of them have their licences suspended.&nbsp; Are all these motorists dangerous and reckless, or we simply have too many traffic rules, thus making it difficult for motorists to abide by?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we must remove dangerous and reckless driving habits on our roads, such as excessive speeding, tailgating or drink driving.&nbsp; The Traffic Police should focus their enforcement efforts to take action against these road abusers. Recalcitrant traffic offenders or those who have accumulated 24 demerit points should be sent for road safety rehabilitation. The Traffic Police should place more emphasis on changing the road behaviour of motorists and pedestrians instead of just issuing summonses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I agree that we must revoke the driving licences of recalcitrant traffic offenders and prevent them from causing safety hazards to other road users. But some of these traffic offenders are not dangerous or reckless.&nbsp; I would like to propose that the Ministry review its penalty regime for the suspension of licence.&nbsp; We should be more flexible and give drivers a second chance.&nbsp; Maybe we put them on a six months' probation period and, thereafter, if they commit further offences,&nbsp;we will suspend their licences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Ministry review the traffic rules to make it simpler and easier to comply?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Ministry review the penalty regime for traffic offenders?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we standardise the speed limits for expressways and all other roads, eg, expressways, 90 kmh and all other roads, 70 kmh?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Arthur Fong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Arthur Fong:</B> Mr Chairman, allow me to share my observations and where the areas of ensuring road safety where we might improve on.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; First and foremost, I have often noted with alarm, while on the road,&nbsp;the lackadaisical attitude&nbsp;parents and minders with children in&nbsp;their vehicle.&nbsp; There are children in&nbsp;a moving car with seat beats but not belted up.&nbsp; There are some parents and minders, usually grandparents, carrying children, mostly toddlers in their arm.&nbsp; The worst group are those with&nbsp;children jumping at the back seat or walking around&nbsp;at the back seat of a speeding MPV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp;United Kingdom, in 2004, there were 495 passenger vehicle occupant fatalities among children under five years of age.&nbsp; Of those 495 fatalities, an estimated 173&nbsp;(35%) were totally unrestrained.&nbsp; Among children under five years old, an estimated 451 lives were saved in 2004 by child restraint use.&nbsp; Of these 451 lives saved, 413 were associated with the use of&nbsp;child safety seats and 38 with the use of adult seat belts.&nbsp; Child safety seats can reduce fatal injuries by 71% for infants and by 54% for toddlers, ages from one to four.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have this to say about belting up, especially for the safety our children:&nbsp; \"Belt up, better a live chicken than a dead duck!\"&nbsp; Perhaps,&nbsp;we could print stickers for dashboards!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another observation is that of heavy vehicles speeding along our expressways.&nbsp; A common phenomenon&nbsp;we see these days&nbsp;is heavy vehicles hogging our&nbsp;expressways.&nbsp; A heavy vehicle, whether loaded or not loaded, travelling at high speed cannot be expected to stop in time in the event of an emergency.&nbsp; They are hazards to other road-users as well. Many of these heavy vehicles are driven by foreign workers&nbsp;ferrying foreign workers to and from work.&nbsp; Are these workers qualified to drive the types of vehicles that they are driving? Are they tested on our highway codes?&nbsp;Have they been tested on our roads?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; Sir, lastly, on the full-day bus lanes.&nbsp; The roads with&nbsp;full-day bus lanes are creating, sometimes, an impossible situation for vehicles intending to make a left turn. An example is&nbsp;Orchard Road where the portion allowing drivers to turn left&nbsp;to, say,&nbsp;Paragon, is almost occupied by buses and other cars which do not follow the bus lane rules. So cars intending to make a left turn would either have to wait, causing a traffic jam, or miss the turn.&nbsp; This problem is not common just to Orchard Road but other areas.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Ser Luck-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Ser Luck:</B> Sir, I have organised and participated in a yearly bike ride called the Sly Ride to create&nbsp;awareness of cycling safety on the road and it is also done in memory of Mr Sylvester&nbsp;Ang who died a few years ago cycling because a bus went against the traffic and knocked him down.&nbsp; The bike ride is now in its third year and the turnout is more than 500 cyclists every year.&nbsp; And the community has set up a safe cycling taskforce.

I am sure that a very substantive and comprehensive review had been accomplished due to the years that it has taken to complete the task, and I think it is important that our primary criminal legislation should be updated in its totality.&nbsp; I was, therefore, disappointed to see a number of illustrations and examples in the revised Code that would appear more relevant in 1871 rather than 2007.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if I were to meet a bullock carrying a box of treasure and decided to drive&nbsp;the bullock in a certain direction, to dishonestly take the treasure,&nbsp;I will be committing theft of the treasure as soon as the bullock begins to move.&nbsp; Or if&nbsp;I were feeling particularly mischievous and decided to introduce water into an icehouse, causing the ice to melt, I will naturally have committed mischief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It might interest Members to know that the examples that I have cited are specific illustrations of offences still listed in the updated Penal Code.&nbsp; Sir, I am not sure how many bullocks carrying treasure are seen on our roads these days or if there is any icehouse still in existence in Singapore.&nbsp; However, I am sure that a more thorough update of the Penal Code could have been done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I was initially very surprised that section 151A had been deleted from the Penal Code.&nbsp; Section 151A refers to, amongst other things, the posting of placards that could incite disobedience against authority.&nbsp; My surprise, however, was short-lived when I came across&nbsp;new section 267C that reproduces the exact wordings of the deleted section 151A</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The Constitution guarantees&nbsp;an accused person&nbsp;right to counsel of his choice.&nbsp; The Courts have on several occasions clarified that that right of access is not an immediate one but should be accorded within a reasonable time and that a balance must be achieved between protecting the accused's rights and allowing the Police to carry out investigations.&nbsp; Although an accused is required to be brought before the Court within&nbsp;48 hours of his arrest, what reasonable time the Police requires to complete&nbsp;their investigations differs from case to case and the Court will generally accept the Police's request for more time.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I recognise the importance of not hindering the Police in their investigations.&nbsp; Like Mr Alvin Yeo who spoke on this&nbsp;during the Budget, I wonder if we are drawing the line too far away from the rights of the accused.&nbsp; While we embrace the principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty, our practices fall short.&nbsp; Being hauled up by the Police is in any view a traumatising experience, especially for the innocent.&nbsp; It is unsafe to assume that innocent people will not make mistakes in an alien, hostile environment and after hours of questioning.&nbsp; This is aggravated by the fact that most do not know their legal rights, for example, the right against self-incrimination.&nbsp; In many cases, by the time the accused is given access to counsel, he would have furnished a signed or several signed statements.&nbsp; He may subsequently be convicted on those statements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, even if the Police believe that questioning the accused without counsel is necessary for their investigations, there is no reason why the accused should not have the benefit of legal advice at least before he signs that statement.&nbsp; In any event, there is no reason why the accused or his lawyers should not be given copies of all statements given by the accused.&nbsp; We need to draw a distinction between aiding the investigation and aiding the prosecution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, lawyers are not permitted to be present when the statement is taken or signed,&nbsp;then the least should be done is to videotape the interview with the accused.&nbsp; A number of countries adopt this practice, including the US, the UK and Australia.&nbsp; Not only does this make the process more transparent, there are a number of tangible benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would drastically reduce the scope of an accused claiming that he was threatened or improperly induced into giving a statement.&nbsp; Such an allegation often leads to a postponement of the&nbsp;main trial to enable the Court to conduct a separate hearing on the admissibility of&nbsp;the statement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the suggestion to videotape was raised in this House in 1994.&nbsp; Prof. Ho replied it was still open for an accused to claim that he was threatened before the statement was given.&nbsp; Although this is theoretically possible, it is highly unlikely&nbsp;because that would mean the threat and inducement would be made even before the Police knows what the person is going to say.&nbsp; Further, the Court will have a contemporaneous record of the statement taking and will be in a position to assess the demeanour of the accused at the relevant time.&nbsp; In any event, not taping is not a better solution.&nbsp; But there are other advantages and I will just give a few.&nbsp; There will be a complete, accurate and permanent record with the statement.&nbsp; There will therefore be no scope for&nbsp;the argument that parts of&nbsp; the accused's statement were omitted.&nbsp; The Police are less likely to be accused of improper conduct&nbsp;and the videos can be reviewed by experts and used as part of the Police training to improve interrogation skills.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

had done a good job in keeping the country safe and that our Police are respectable, well-trained, disciplined and capable.&nbsp; A large majority, 96% of the respondents in the survey, said that the general security in Singapore is good, very good or excellent and more than nine in 10 felt that security was better in Singapore than in most other countries.&nbsp; Today, these qualities still hold true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Home Team is as good as the people in it.&nbsp; Police work is highly labour intensive.&nbsp; We need good capable men and women.&nbsp; Unlike other public sectors, such as education and health, this is a field where it is difficult to import foreign talent or to sub-contract out.&nbsp; The integrity of the Police force, like our Armed Forces, is dependent on good Singaporean men and women.&nbsp; From this select pool, we must recruit and retain good police officers, especially those who are involved in investigative work for their \"institutional memory\" and experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, more than ever, we need the best people we can get in the Force as terrorism rears its ugly head.&nbsp; Higher retention of capable officers will translate into safer streets and communities, and better preparedness against terrorist attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having more manpower resources will help to ease the stress on officers arising from erratic working hours and the impromptu and emergency calls to return to work.&nbsp; This is because it is&nbsp;impossible to predict when a crime will be committed.&nbsp; I have had first-hand experience of this when working with an SIS Team which was investigating into a murder, committed just after a&nbsp;midnight on New Year's &nbsp;Day, which we eventually prosecuted and went to trial for.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also help to reduce the attrition rate of burnout officers.&nbsp; I am particularly concerned with the possible increase in crimes and vice activities that will&nbsp;come with the completion of the Integrated Resorts.&nbsp; Therefore, besides remuneration, there is also the extremely important issue of manpower.&nbsp; Hence, my second question is this: I would like to ask whether the Ministry will be recruiting more officers to ease the manpower pressures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Home Team</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Sir, since 2004, Ministries, except Defence, have been required to cut their manpower over three years.&nbsp; Saving public money is prudent but are there compromises to the public interest?&nbsp; There appears to be a shortfall of about one thousand between the establishment and actual headcount for MHA for FY 2005.&nbsp; In particular, there seems to be a shortage of police officers.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous sessions of Parliament had discussed the public unhappiness over the shortening of Neighbourhood Police Post hours due to the conversion to the Neighbourhood Police Centre system. People lamented seeing less officers doing foot and bicycle patrols.&nbsp; In response to this, the Police further shortened NPP hours in 2004.&nbsp; As reported in the <I>Straits Times</I> of 31st March 2004, the NPPs would only open between noon and&nbsp;10 pm.&nbsp; This was to free up the one officer manning the post so that he could walk the streets.&nbsp; It was reported that Budget constraints prevented the Police from hiring more officers, forcing the change in NPP operations.&nbsp; After 10 pm, anyone needing help has to call the Police and wait or to go to the closed NPP, press the red button and wait for the call to be answered.&nbsp; I wonder about the effectiveness of that red button when faced with an immediate confrontational crime.&nbsp; Though the Ministry may cite statistics showing under-utilisation of the NPPs now, they being open clearly reduces public fear of crime in the heartlands.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Police have outsourced some of their functions over the years.&nbsp; Presumably, Budget considerations were behind these moves.&nbsp; How far will such outsourcing go and what are the downsides?&nbsp; Last year, many motorists booked for parking and bus lane violations noted that the outsourced agents appeared overzealous.&nbsp; They felt a police officer would have exercised discretion and kept law enforcement reasonable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, Sir, are there sufficient resources to attend to cases?&nbsp; Recently, a resident called a Neighbourhood Police Centre to request assistance on a case of loud karaoke music coming from a nearby flat.&nbsp; To his surprise, he was told that there were no resources available to attend to his complaint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In yesterday's <I>Straits Times Forum</I> page, a lady recounted her discovery of a dead body in the sea off East Coast Park last week.&nbsp; According to her, the Police took a whole hour to arrive due to other emergencies.&nbsp; Meanwhile, due to the long wait, a crowd, including children attending a birthday party, started coming round to see the body.&nbsp; In a crime situation, a one-hour delay could result in the contamination of a crime scene.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, are the above indications of a&nbsp;resource shortage and is there a compromise of the public interest?&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, I thank the Members for raising their concerns as well as some of the comments on the Ministry,&nbsp;its performance and its&nbsp;law officers.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin asked for an update on the counter-terrorism measures.&nbsp; As Dr Teo has pointed out, our approach has been to prioritise our counter-terrorism efforts intelligently using a risk-based assessment of threats and vulnerabilities. We cannot protect everything but we can make Singapore a hard target.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, we have raised the protective measures at key installations and iconic sites like this Parliament House itself. In Aug 2005, we formed a Police MRT Unit to enhance our public transport security. We have also started to engage the business sector to enhance security.&nbsp; For example, to harden \"soft\" targets like shopping malls, we have engaged business or building operators and owners through the Security Watch Group Scheme to take ownership of their own security.&nbsp;Now, we have 72 Security Watch Group clusters&nbsp;taking care of&nbsp; 520 buildings in the business districts.&nbsp; We have also established the CCTV standards to support the ground deployment of CCTV systems. These are on-going programmes and will cover more buildings and areas over time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January this year, Parliament approved amendments to the Arms and Explosives Act to tighten controls over hazardous materials and&nbsp;establish a new licensing regime for explosive precursors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 2005, the SCDF implemented the Hazmat Vehicle Tracking System, which closely monitors the movement of all hazmat vehicles in Singapore on a real-time basis. From April 2007, we will install immobilisers on all such vehicles, which means that the moment the vehicle goes off&nbsp; the scheduled route, they will be immobilised by a remote control.&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent terrorist bomb attacks in Iraq using chlorine underscore the timeliness of our efforts in this area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many measures we have embarked upon are not so visible. Our agencies have significantly expanded their foreign liaison networks since 2001. When the July 2005 subway bombings occurred in London, we were able to send a Police team to London&nbsp;to learn directly from the Scotland Yard investigators on what to do with&nbsp;the incident and such learning is invaluable in order to improve ourselves and stay ahead of the terrorists.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo&nbsp;also asked about the lessons we learnt&nbsp;in&nbsp;Exercise Northstar V. What was new in this exercise was that about 10,000 commuters were exposed to what a terrorist attack on our MRT system would entail. Many were supportive of the public involvement&nbsp;in such exercises. A small number of commuters were of course unhappy&nbsp;because of the inconvenience they have suffered.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree with Mr Arthur&nbsp;Fong that more Singaporeans need to take ownership of safety, security and emergency preparedness. They need to understand that the inconvenience created by such exercises is but&nbsp;a small and necessary price to pay to ensure our preparedness. They also need to know that security has a personal value to themselves and their families because being prepared can make&nbsp;a difference between life and death in a crisis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree also with Dr Teo's observation that it is unrealistic to expect Singaporeans to become better prepared for a terrorist attack after just&nbsp;one or two emergency exercises. That is why we must persevere while developing a multi-pronged approach in our&nbsp;outreach.&nbsp;For those people grouped under&nbsp;the different heads cited by Mr Arthur Fong, whether it is&nbsp;head in the clouds,&nbsp;head in the sand, or&nbsp;whatever,&nbsp;I just wish that they pay attention to what Mr Fong said this afternoon and take heed and get involved with emergency preparedness before they find it is&nbsp;too late when an incident happened to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from large-scale exercises, we reach out to the people on the ground through publications and initiatives like the Ready Bag. In 2006, the SCDF&nbsp;conducted 72 Emergency Preparedness Days with MPs and&nbsp;grassroots&nbsp; leaders where participants learn basic first-aid&nbsp;and how to protect their homes from a chemical attack using In-Place Protection.&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Christopher de Souza suggested implementing further measures to control the entry of firearms into Singapore. Our controls over firearms are already very stringent. In order to carry firearms, one needs a police permit.&nbsp; Without one, then it is an offence to carry&nbsp; firearms.&nbsp; So, as a result, Singapore has one of the lowest number of firearm-related offences or incidents in the world.&nbsp; &nbsp;Over the last six years from year 2000 to 2006, we had seven cases involving the use of firearms.&nbsp; Six had been solved and two of these seven involved CISCO officers who were authorised to carry firearms.&nbsp; Obviously, as Mr De Souza has said, I cannot discuss the case of Tan Chor Jin, as to how he got his weapon.&nbsp; The case is still before the Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But the most important measure here to prevent the smuggling of firearms or arms and explosives&nbsp;and intrusion of terrorist element is a strong border security system. Our border is&nbsp;our first line of defence.&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of security checks and screening at our checkpoints has been enhanced. We detected more than 20,000 cases of smuggling in 2006, including 900 travellers who tried to bring in security related items like stun-guns and air-guns.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must also be realistic. Singapore is an island.&nbsp; Our borders are not air-tight and some will&nbsp;try their luck to evade our checks and some may succeed. But we believe that&nbsp;most will be caught, if not at the borders, then eventually within the country.&nbsp; Our officers will do their level best to keep Singapore safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is ultimately no such thing as absolute security. No government anywhere in the world can ever completely insulate its population against threats. Instead, we must act sensibly and balance the trade-offs&nbsp;of security against our other needs, whether it is economic, social or political.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, we cannot seal off our borders and yet remain an open society and economy.&nbsp; During peak periods, more than 21,000 travellers go through our land checkpoints every hour. Even this number is exceeded during the festive holidays and can you imagine with 21,000 travellers in one hour, how much resources&nbsp;we need in order to screen everyone and make sure that they leave or they come in and do not cause harm to Singapore?&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, although ICA has leveraged extensively on technology to expedite speed of clearance, there are limits. Congestion and delays are inevitable. Lowering our security levels at the Checkpoints,&nbsp;for the sake of convenience, is something that we must not be tempted to do. I think Singaporeans will sleep&nbsp;better and more safely if they exercise a little patience and allow our security agencies to do their job properly.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Managing trade-offs and optimising resources is also something we are addressing in the area of Emergency Ambulance Service. This is an issue raised by Dr Fatimah Lateef.&nbsp; The SCDF ambulance has responded to 96,000 calls in 2006. The demand for ambulance services has consistently increased but we cannot continually expand the SCDF pool of ambulances and paramedics. These are costly and highly geared resources, well-trained and&nbsp;designed to handle extreme crises including biological and chemical terrorist incidents. These resources should be prioritised for security-related emergencies or for crises.&nbsp; However, the general need for ambulance services for medical emergencies is likely to grow with an ageing population. Those above 65 years old account for nearly 30% of all our Emergency Ambulance Service calls though they only represent&nbsp;8% of&nbsp;our population today.&nbsp; Can you imagine that when our population, those aged 65 and above, grow further in the years to come, what would be the expected number of calls from the 65 and above?&nbsp; The projection is that about&nbsp;55% of&nbsp;the calls will be made&nbsp;for such cases by the year 2030.&nbsp; MHA is therefore seriously considering how to solve this problem.&nbsp; One option is for the SCDF to encourage competent private ambulance providers to meet this need. By increasing the emergency ambulance supply in this way, we can judiciously meet the trend of rising demand and also augment the SCDF resource pool in times of crisis.&nbsp; Of course, those who undertake this task in the private sector must also be well-trained and well-equipped and this is what the SCDF hopes to do in the coming years, to prepare the private sector&nbsp;for that task.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the terrorism threat remains. And we see a troubling new phenomenon today of individuals who are self-radicalised, independent of direct recruitment by established terrorist groups.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is not immune to the threat of self-radicalised individuals. In recent times, our Internal Security Department (ISD) has investigated into a few Singaporeans who had become attracted to terrorist and radical ideas purveyed in the mass media, particularly over the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 6,000 websites today carrying pro-terrorist ideas. They distort Islamic concepts in furtherance of a terrorist agenda and prey on those who lack sound religious knowledge to unwittingly buy into such terrorist propaganda. For example, a young Singaporean, after exposure to such propaganda on the Net, believed that it was permissible to take part in armed <I>jihad</I> regardless of the origin of the <I>fatwa</I> and grew to admire Osama bin Laden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Youths can also be radicalised while pursuing studies overseas. In one case, the young man developed an intense interest in radical ideology while studying overseas. He continued after returning to Singapore and engaged like-minded individuals over the Internet and&nbsp;eventually even communicating with foreign individuals involved in terrorist recruitment and financing. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our Muslim community has initiated many programmes to address such radicalism. For example, MUIS' <I>Asatizah</I> Recognition Scheme serves as a reference for the Muslim community when selecting their religious teachers, so that they do not unwittingly engage radical teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Religious Rehabilitation Group, which comprises 30 volunteer <I>asatizah</I>, has done a commendable job in counselling&nbsp;their spouses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Malay/Muslim organisations have also come forward.&nbsp;In February 2007, the&nbsp;National Junior College's Malay Language, Drama and Debate Society (MLDDS), with the support of Mendaki Club, organised a dialogue session on the threat of terrorism for Junior College students. In January 2007, Taman Bacaan held a convention to raise awareness among youths on the threat of terrorism and terrorist ideology. About 300 youths, both Muslims and non-Muslims too, from secondary schools, junior colleges, ITEs and madrasahs took part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some individuals in our Muslim community have also stepped up to address the threat of terrorist propaganda. Ustaz Muhammad Haniff Hassan, a research analyst at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, recently published a book called \"Unlicensed to Kill; Countering Imam Samudra's Justification for the Bali Bombing\". Imam Samudra was the leader of the JI cell which staged the Bali bombings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In October 2006, Ustaz Haniff also created a blog (counterideology.freeonlineblogs.com) -&nbsp;take a look at that -&nbsp;to refute extremist ideology. Taking the counter-ideology effort on-line is a significant direction, since it is impractical to try to shut down all terrorist websites. Religious and community groups must actively work through education and engagement to prevent extremist ideas from gaining a foothold in&nbsp;our mainstream community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Arthur Fong asked how we can do more to encourage community involvement against terrorism. One of the ways we are doing so is through the Community Engagement Programme (CEP).&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the launch of the Community Engagement Programme, we have established a national-level working framework and have actively engaged a broad range of community partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also seen many encouraging ground-up initiatives in support of the CEP. I strongly support such ground-up efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had mentioned some initiatives earlier. Another recent example is Al Khair Mosque and the Grassroot Organisations from Choa Chu Kang, Keat Hong and Yew Tee organising in January an Inter-Faith Forum for community leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was also especially heartening to observe the&nbsp;interest among our young. A group of youths pursued a project on inter-religious understanding called 'Project Connect'. Under this project, they attended a three-day camp, made study trips to different religious sites and agencies and held a Singapore Inter-Faith Youth Forum to promote inter-religious understanding, in January this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The business community too, which Dr Teo referred to,&nbsp;is also playing its part. The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) together with the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations (SFCCA) formed a CEP taskforce to engage the other ethnic groups. They organised a job fair in September&nbsp;last year&nbsp;to increase the number of Malay workers in Chinese firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a Tripartite Panel on Community Engagement at Workplaces was formed in October 2006. The Panel is working to expand its outreach to cover the various subgroups&nbsp;in the business community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;the Home Team will do as much as we can to keep Singapore safe and secure. However, we cannot take extreme measures to protect everything, as doing so will lead to a society paralysed by fear and an economy mired in a security gridlock. We need to make critical judgements about risks and trade-offs, balancing security and other needs all the time. Ultimately, it is the people and not the Government who will defeat terrorism. This has been our approach since 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that it must have been difficult and awkward for all, especially our Muslim community, to grapple with sensitive issues linked to the nature of this terrorism today. However, our people responded rationally and positively. In particular, our Muslim community leaders have boldly moved to address the dangers of radicalisation.&nbsp; Singaporeans know very well that the real damage in extremist terrorism can pose is not just material destruction but the more permanent damage against our social cohesion and community harmony.&nbsp; We must not let this happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Singaporeans are the stakeholders of Singapore&rsquo;s safety and security. When we all take ownership of our own security and safety, we will not only make Singapore a hard target &ndash; we will also make Singaporeans a resilient people who will not be cowed or intimidated by terrorism.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now ask my Senior Minister of State to deal with other parts of&nbsp; the questions before I come back to answer Mr de Souza's subsequent&nbsp;question on police and Ms Sylvia Lim's question on the resources for the Home Team.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Sir, the law and order challenges confronting us have become more complex.&nbsp; Whilst maintaining a safe and secure environment, we also aim to create a dynamic and vibrant society.&nbsp; In short, MHA can play a role in shaping Singapore into the society we aspire to be.&nbsp; Let me share how we are doing this.\r\n\r\n<p><I><br>\r\n</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, by ensuring that the fundamental bedrock of law and order remains firmly in place by being tough on crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asks what is SPF's success rate in solving crimes.&nbsp; For the past five years, Police solved at least 50% of the crimes reported.&nbsp; For serious crimes such as murder, firearm robbery, rape and serious hurt, the clearance rate is&nbsp;higher: 100% for murder and firearm robbery and over 60% for rape and serious hurt.&nbsp; Compared to other police forces, this is a good outcome, achieved not because, as happens in some other countries where people hesitate to report crimes. &nbsp;Singaporeans report crimes here&nbsp;because they have confidence that the SPF will tackle them. Hence, Singaporeans feel safe, as various polls have shown. These inputs are indeed the safety index that Ms Ellen Lee suggests that we should have.&nbsp; This is, in fact,&nbsp;a clear signal from Singaporeans that they feel safe.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a key feature of a maturing society is that it cares for its vulnerable members, which in the case of crime, are our youths and elderly, a point raised by&nbsp;Dr Teo and also Ms Ellen Lee.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Dr Teo&nbsp;and the House that youth crime is under control.&nbsp; Between 2005 and 2006, the number of youths arrested fell by 28%. The number of youths who were victims of major crimes also fell by 18%. Under the leadership of the National Committee on Youth Guidance and Rehabilitation or NYGR, formerly called the Inter-Ministry&nbsp;Committee on Youth Crime or IMYC which I chair, Police will continue to implement measures targeted at youths.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NYGR agencies have introduced more than 25 programmes over the past 10-11 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have helped reduce youth crime. One example is an annual Youth Crime Prevention Roadshow at our schools and ITEs, which takes an interactive and reflective approach to engage youths.&nbsp; This is how you have to do it.&nbsp; You cannot be dogmatic, you cannot just talk down to them.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The \"Youth Hanging Out Late\" initiative informs parents if their children are found outdoors engaging in \"at-risk\" activities after 11.00 pm. To date, Police has issued more than 650 letters.

Therefore, like DPM Wong, I would&nbsp;urge all Singaporeans&nbsp;to continue to do their part, for example, by reporting suspicious characters loitering in their neighbourhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;When they do this, they will help prevent crime, such as moneylending. I think Ms&nbsp;Ellen Lee has asked about this.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something which I had also mentioned in the House before and I had enumerated all the steps that had been taken.&nbsp; Let&nbsp;me assure Ms Lee that we will continue to work with CID, MHA, together with the agencies, to keep moneylending&nbsp;under control.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also the same thing for&nbsp;Internet crime that I think Ms Lee has talked about.&nbsp;As for the use of private security agencies and the fight against crime, Ms Lee has made a good point.&nbsp; Yes, indeed, over the last three to four years working with NTUC, we have upgraded these security agencies. So, now, they are better paid&nbsp;and better trained. &nbsp;There is greater pride and&nbsp;they wear smarter&nbsp;uniforms.&nbsp;These efforts have&nbsp;helped us in the overall fight, not only against crime, but also against terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On fighting crime to maintain law and order, let me assure the House that not only will we press on,&nbsp;we will also explore&nbsp;innovative and&nbsp;new strategies. Let me just cite two examples.&nbsp; First,&nbsp;Police's SMS Crime Alert Scheme&nbsp;provides crime information via text messages to community partners and participating handphone subscribers.&nbsp;It is quick, it is&nbsp;instant.&nbsp; I think it is a medium that all people use.&nbsp; &nbsp;Another is the Handphone IMEI Tracing System, or HITS, which has helped to reduce handphone thefts.&nbsp;Here, again, it is online and&nbsp;accessible.&nbsp; But I am open to ideas from all the&nbsp;GPC members and, indeed, the House, on how we can do crime prevention efforts better.<br>\r\n &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Ellen Lee then asked about&nbsp;vice. She asked how&nbsp;we manage vice here in view of our open-door policy towards foreigners.&nbsp;We take a pragmatic approach where we confine prostitution to traditional red light areas; we take enforcement actions against prostitutes who solicit in public and against pimps who force women into prostitution or live off their earnings; and we also keep syndicates out.&nbsp; That is why we tackle vice activities carried out illicitly in places such as massage parlours -&nbsp;I think Ms Ellen Lee mentioned that -&nbsp;vigorously, and also against other places like entertainment outlets where there may be vice.&nbsp; Therefore, the assurance to Ms Lee is that the situation regarding massage parlours is now under control.&nbsp; But, of course, we will continue to&nbsp;regulate&nbsp;through licensing requirements and also through constant checks.<br>\r\n &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, some 4,310 foreign prostitutes were arrested, up 34% compared to the year before.&nbsp; The easing of our visa requirements to some countries to promote inbound tourism has contributed to this increase.&nbsp;To counter this, ICA takes a calibrated approach to detect non-genuine visitors. Thus, visitors suspected of coming here for vice activities are subject to further checks and interviews. In addition, foreigners, including student pass and work permit holders found to be involved in vice activities, are repatriated and banned from entering Singapore again.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As many of the foreign sex workers congregate in Geylang, Police&nbsp;has stepped up enforcement operations there. Last year, Police deployed CCTVs along selected streets generally to prevent crime, but&nbsp;they also had a salutary effect of deterring solicitation by sex workers. Police also works with partners, such as the Hotel Licensing Board and URA, to conduct joint checks on budget hotels and lodging houses there.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;therefore say that,&nbsp;like crime and drugs, vice is under control here.&nbsp; Police is well aware that on all three fronts, the Integrated Resorts will indeed present criminals with new possibilities to exploit. Hence, Police, together with&nbsp;the Casino Regulatory Authority which is under MHA,&nbsp;is already gearing up. And the assurance is that they will be ready to tackle this new challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as our society matures, we will continue to refine our criminal justice system.&nbsp; Thus, we are calibrating our approach towards the rights of accused persons with regard to their access to counsel when in police custody, a point raised by Mr Hri Kumar and also by Mr Alvin Yeo in the House when he spoke on the Budget&nbsp;Statement on Tuesday.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the right of an accused person to legal counsel, as Mr Kumar will know,&nbsp;is&nbsp;found in our Constitution, Article 9(3).&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts have determined that this right may be exercised within a reasonable time, not immediately,&nbsp;upon arrest. Basically, I think we need&nbsp;to strike a balance between an accused person's rights on the one hand and the protection of the public interest to ensure that Police is able to effectively investigate the case.&nbsp;Our laws require every accused person to be brought before a Magistrate without unreasonable delay within 48 hours of his arrest.&nbsp; If Police wants to further remand the accused, it has to make out a case before the Magistrate.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent police study showed that more than 90% of arrested persons were released within 48 hours. A robust monitoring system ensures that for the rest, investigations are completed expeditiously, so that there is no unnecessary remand.&nbsp; In fact, only 1% of arrested persons were remanded beyond a week.&nbsp; Generally, this 1% involved&nbsp;more serious and complex cases that required&nbsp;further police investigations or more intensive police investigations. The key point, therefore, is this: that in the vast majority of cases, accused persons are released early and do have early access to counsel.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, we have looked at how we can improve the current situation. Therefore, Police piloted a project in March last year for remanded accused persons to meet their lawyers earlier, ie, towards the end of the one-week remand period, on condition that the accused person does not discuss the case with his lawyer. Police may allow this even though investigations have not yet been completed.&nbsp; We will review the outcome of this pilot some time in the middle of this year.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Kumar suggests that we video-tape police interviews to guard against police abuse. As he rightly pointed out, I have explained earlier in this House that&nbsp;doing this will not avert such allegations of abuse.&nbsp;This is because the suspect can still allege that he was threatened before the recording or during breaks in the recording.&nbsp; The court thus cannot readily rely on such recorded interviews.&nbsp;There is feedback also from jurisdictions which have implemented this.&nbsp; In fact, I understand in one jurisdiction, even in the police car, while the suspect is being transported to the police station, there could already be threat taking place.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put things in perspective, let me say that the suspect's statements are usually only one piece of evidence, amongst others, such as the witnesses' testimony or physical evidence obtained at the crime scene,&nbsp;which Police uses to prove its case against the accused. Of course, Mr Kumar knows, in any case, in court, we have&nbsp;an established process called&nbsp;\"<I>voir dire</I> \" or \"trial within a trial\" to establish the voluntariness of the statement.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp;the key question really is this: do Singaporeans have confidence in our legal system and our Police Force?&nbsp; Like I have said, surveys have indicated that on both counts, this is the case. Indeed, this is unlike some of the countries where video-taping of police interviews has been implemented, thereby creating pressure for the video-taping.&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;this position&nbsp;in public trust in Police has&nbsp;been secured after a long time.&nbsp;I am sure Police will not do anything that will erode Singaporeans' confidence in them and, indeed, neither will&nbsp;DPM nor myself and the Commissioner of&nbsp;Police.&nbsp; So for&nbsp;police abuse, we will be the first to say, \"Hey, don't do that.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, Mr Chong presses me for an update of the Penal Code. I think this must be the fourth or fifth time in COS.&nbsp;Thank you for&nbsp;his compliments. Indeed, we are&nbsp;seeing light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;I did&nbsp;report&nbsp;in COS last year that we would hold a public consultation exercise when the amendments were ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exercise was launched in November last year&nbsp;via the REACH portal. Many Singaporeans took this opportunity to provide valuable feedback on the proposed amendments.&nbsp; We received, in fact, some&nbsp;250 responses on the portal, and many more through the email and post which, of course, we&nbsp;were gratified to note.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also organised three focus group sessions to seek input from Singaporeans&nbsp;from different walks of life. We are also seeking input from the Law Society and the courts.&nbsp;We are now studying the many inputs received and plan to introduce the Bill in Parliament some time in the middle of this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong also points out that we have kept some archaic notions in the Penal Code.&nbsp; He talked about \"horses and carriages\" in various sections.&nbsp; Let me first say that we have actually updated and clarified many definitions, explanations and expressions in the Code, some 21 sections. But as for \"horses and carriages\", I have asked my officers to go and check&nbsp;with the Attorney-General's Chambers.&nbsp; I know that they have gone through it and&nbsp;found the phrase in some exceptions and&nbsp;explanations.&nbsp; But, indeed, if they detract rather than aid in explaining the section, we can remove them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for section 151A, yes, Mr Chong is correct.&nbsp; It is still there and is&nbsp;placed under another Chapter which has been re-captioned,&nbsp;because the offence is a serious one - to incite violence or&nbsp;disobedience to the law.&nbsp; And in line with some other provisions in the Act, the punishment has been raised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n <I>&nbsp;</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, traffic rules.&nbsp; Singaporeans' sense of well-being encompasses some assurance that when they travel on our roads, they will be safe. This is as much law and order as well as&nbsp;safety.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is as much a matter of having a good road system and effective regulatory regime, as it is of getting Singaporeans to internalise and embrace a courteous and safety-first mindset whenever they go on the road, whether as driver, motorcyclist, bicyclist and, indeed, even as&nbsp;pedestrian. So I must disagree with Dr Teo when he says&nbsp;that our traffic rules are a \"web of traps\"!&nbsp; I think he knows that&nbsp;the statement&nbsp;does a disservice to the Traffic Police (TP).<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his suggestion that we standardise the speed limit for each type of roads, let me first say that setting road speed limits is not Traffic Police's sole responsibility but a shared one with LTA, taking into account factors such as road characteristics, profile of road users and surrounding land use.&nbsp; In a recent review stretching a year and a half, TP and LTA actually raised the road speed limits for about 250 roads island-wide. &nbsp;I think Members of this House who have been here long enough will appreciate this exercise.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed limits are set to enable our drivers to travel at a reasonable speed, appropriate for the road conditions, but without compromising users' safety or efficiency of the road network. Given this objective, standardising the speed limit for each type of road is actually not desirable. It may result in a situation where speed limits are not optimised because not all roads, even of the same type, are homogenous.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On matters relating to zebra crossings, bus lanes and double white lines,&nbsp;and&nbsp;what Mr Arthur Fong mentioned&nbsp;about full-day bus lanes,&nbsp;actually these are under&nbsp;MOT and LTA, not under&nbsp;the Traffic Police, so I would suggest that the&nbsp;Members address them&nbsp;with the Minister for Transport.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also suggests that, instead of revoking his licence, an offender who accumulates 24 demerit points be given a six-month probation period.&nbsp; Sir, a motorist does not lose his driving licence after accumulating 24 demerit points for the first time.&nbsp; I think we all know that.&nbsp; It will only be revoked or&nbsp;made \"of no effect\", if he is suspended for the third time under the Driver Improvement Points System (DIPS).&nbsp; Indeed, the first suspension can be deferred upon him passing a Retraining Course, provided there was no accident caused.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, DIPS is actually structured to give the motorist ample \"opportunities to repent\" so as to avoid any suspension of his licence, which is really what a proposed \"probation\" is intended to do.&nbsp; In fact, a motorist who maintains a clean driving record over specified periods will have his demerit points and previous suspension records removed. &nbsp;Therefore, the point I am making is that&nbsp;the&nbsp;DIPS framework does aim to change an errant motorist's driving habit, giving him ample opportunities along the way,&nbsp;and not just to punish him.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Teo Ser Luck asks about accidents involving cyclists.&nbsp; Most&nbsp;of these accidents occur&nbsp;when motorists and cyclists either fail to keep a proper lookout, do not give way to traffic with the right of way, or change lanes without due care.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With greater recognition of their vulnerability, these accidents can be prevented.&nbsp; To promote safe riding, Traffic Police last year conducted road safety talks for local and foreign workers and exhibitions in schools and workplaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Police also works with construction companies and worker dormitories to reach out to foreign workers, disseminating videos and posters in their languages featuring bicyclist safety.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final point is by Mr Arthur Fong on child and booster seats.&nbsp; Research shows that proper use of child and booster seats can greatly reduce the severity of a young child&rsquo;s injuries in an accident.&nbsp; Therefore, in Singapore, all children below eight years should be properly secured.&nbsp; Indeed, there is enforcement, because the rules are there.&nbsp; Any driver who fails to comply with the rule&nbsp;can be fined $120 and given three demerit points.&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Police does issue summons against errant drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;Mr Fong's point, which I think&nbsp;all of us must agree with, is that the key point really on this is getting parents to recognise that using&nbsp;child restraints can save the child's life.&nbsp; Thus, Traffic Police promotes their use through exhibitions and talks conducted at pre-schools and primary schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to urge all parents to do what is right for their young children who have no say in the matter.&nbsp; After all, it is impractical for us, as a society, to legislate and enforce parental responsibility.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;What does all this mean?&nbsp; Let me now summarise the points that I have made.&nbsp; What I have shared essentially illustrates an important principle, which is this.&nbsp; Whilst we evolve as a society, seeking to maintain safety and security but also loosening up to create a more vibrant Singapore, there is a need for Singaporeans to step forward and take greater ownership of these issues.&nbsp; You may ask \"How?\" &nbsp;By exercising personal responsibility for safety and avoid becoming victims of crime;&nbsp;by showing greater tolerance and give and take in sharing all of this 700-odd-square-kilometre island which&nbsp;4.3 million people call Home.&nbsp; I include here our permanent residents, because Singapore is their home for the time being.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, finally,&nbsp;by coming forward to partner the Home Team to tackle security and law and order challenges together.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir,&nbsp;Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Christopher de Souza raised the concern that resource constraints may lead to compromises of public interest and about the challenges in attracting and retaining good police officers and other members of the Home Team.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, we are constantly optimising the use of&nbsp;resources through various innovations.&nbsp; One good example is the Police's move from the Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP) system to the Neighbourhood Police Centre system.&nbsp; It was a strategic move made by the Police to evolve and keep pace with the changes in the operating environment, and to improve the system of community policing.&nbsp; Right now, we have, across the nation,&nbsp;32 NPCs supported by 65 NPPs, totalling 97 police contact points.&nbsp; This is not much different from the good old days that we had which Ms Lim lamented when&nbsp;we had 90-plus NPPs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new system means that police presence is more visible in the neighbourhood, and not just confined to the NPPs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, under the current NPC system, all patrol resources in the precinct are&nbsp;managed directly by the NPCs.&nbsp; This will enable the NPCs to respond more quickly and flexibly to the needs of the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;The real measure of our safety is not just on how many contact points you have with the Police but on our sense of safety and security.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr de Souza mentioned the <I>Forbes</I> report which reported well on Singaporeans' sense of safety.&nbsp; But other research institutions, such as the WEF, in its <I>World Competitiveness Report,</I> as well as&nbsp;PERC, also reported well on our Singapore Police Force and our sense of safety.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are constantly reviewing our roles to focus on security and other core functions.&nbsp; One of the strategies in this effort is to outsource non-core functions, and this is done carefully to ensure that we do not compromise the public interest.&nbsp; This includes the outsourcing of&nbsp;enforcement of illegal parking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Lim&nbsp;mentioned that some of the outsourced traffic wardens appear over-zealous.&nbsp; Ms Lim should note that the performance of these wardens is not assessed according to&nbsp;the number of summonses they issued, which is a misperception by the public.&nbsp; If the aggrieved party feels that a summons was unfairly issued, he or she can appeal through the normal channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Lim also mentioned yesterday's <I>Forum</I> letter which wrote about the delay in responding to a case of a body found.&nbsp; Police has informed me that that delay was due to poor command and control by the Police Division which resulted in a delay of about 25 minutes before the resource was sent.&nbsp; Upon arrival, the resource took another 20 minutes to find the location, as they were not familiar with the location.&nbsp; The Police is looking into the handling of this incident with a view to improving our Police service.&nbsp; But, please, do not shoot at the Police every time there is an incident.&nbsp; Give them a chance to tell you why and what happened.&nbsp; Of course, we do not condone mistakes which are made because of the officer's own neglect of his duty.&nbsp; But if an officer genuinely makes a mistake, I think we have&nbsp;to&nbsp;accept that and to help him improve.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Lim&nbsp;should be able to see a reply to the letter soon in the newspaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, safety and security&nbsp;remain the Home Team's top priority.&nbsp; The overall crime rate&nbsp;for the past 20 years shows a general downward trend, with a clear decline in 2006.&nbsp; I will now ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute a set of charts showing the general trends in crime, drug arrests, fire incidents, recidivism rates of prison inmates and the population at drug rehabilitation centres, to show that the general safety and security situation in Singapore is positive, and has improved&nbsp;over the past decade.&nbsp; Take your time, flip through it and understand what these figures mean for all of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must continue to emphasise that we have to optimise all&nbsp;available resources to ensure that our public interests are efficiently and effectively served.&nbsp; So far, if Members&nbsp;look at the numbers carefully,&nbsp;the Home Team has been able to do so and has done it well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we recognise that, today,&nbsp;security work&nbsp;is very demanding on the officer and his family.&nbsp; Each year,&nbsp;many of our&nbsp;officers have to forgo portions of their annual leave due to exigencies of service.&nbsp; Many of our ICA officers at the checkpoints routinely have to work overtime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding the right officers to do these jobs is critical.&nbsp; They have to be security-cleared and be able to meet the demanding physical, intellectual and psychological requirements.&nbsp; Despite stepping up recruitment efforts in 2006, only 10% of applicants actually met the recruitment criteria for&nbsp;junior officers in the Home Team while 15% of applicants met the criteria for the senior service.&nbsp; So the pool is not very large to start with.&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is further compounded by the higher resignation rate in 2006.&nbsp; Retention, therefore, is also critical.&nbsp; Experience and specialist training are valuable and not immediately replaceable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Ministry&nbsp;must keep pace with the tightening labour market and offer a competitive remuneration package commensurate with the demands of the job.&nbsp; Otherwise, the Ministry will face difficulties attracting and retaining capable officers, leading to a degradation of our capacities and capabilities. &nbsp;We are undertaking a salary review for the different schemes of service in the Home Team and will be completing the review shortly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the strength of the Home Team is in its officers.&nbsp; Attracting and retaining capable officers is&nbsp;the key to maintaining Singapore's low crime rate and good security.&nbsp; Many foreign visitors appreciate this when they come.&nbsp; Singaporeans have more or less taken our safety for granted.&nbsp; They would not feel it because it has always been safe.&nbsp; But when&nbsp;they come from a place that is less safe, they&nbsp;notice it straightaway.&nbsp; So, many of these visitors, after the visit,&nbsp;wrote to the&nbsp;Prime Minister, the Senior Minister and the Minister Mentor, expressing their appreciation for the&nbsp;safety they felt in Singapore and how much they had enjoyed Singapore and being able to walk in the streets, jog in the parks, and so on, without the fear of being mugged.&nbsp; Compared with their&nbsp;own country, they think it is a&nbsp;remarkable change. &nbsp;These fundamentals of safety and security are the foundation upon which Singapore's progress and development&nbsp;are built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now make some concluding remarks regarding this afternoon's replies that both my Senior Minister of State and I have given to&nbsp;Members who have raised many questions in the last few days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a recurrent theme in our responses is that Singaporeans, whether as individuals, organisations or communities, are the ultimate stakeholders of Singapore's safety and security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we have highlighted the constant need for balanced judgements and trade-offs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;Ministry of Home Affairs has to make judgements over the optimal deployment of finite resources, balancing competing imperatives without compromising its mission for a safe and secure Singapore for all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans, too, need to make choices.&nbsp; Today, Singaporeans enjoy a low crime rate, low drug problem and good security.&nbsp; In the course of change, Singaporeans will have to ask themselves how much they value this quality of life and how much of it they want to put at risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we think we can afford to go soft on drugs, for example,&nbsp;because they connote a fashionable, desirable lifestyle, then we will have to live with the consequences of drug abuse to our families and the next generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we emulate societies which have gone soft on drugs because they have failed to deal with it or should we staunchly defend our success and our zero tolerance policy?&nbsp; That question Singaporeans would have to decide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, if we choose to lower the threshold of security at our borders and inside the country to avoid inconvenience, then we must face the enhanced risk of a terrorist incident.&nbsp; I am not exaggerating this.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had specific intelligence of how our strict security measures have deterred terrorists like the JI&rsquo;s Azahari Husin from targeting us.&nbsp; Azahari Husin, of course, had been shot dead by the Indonesians.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

They comprise security managers and senior people of the buildings where we have propagated this particular scheme.&nbsp;They take their job very seriously.&nbsp; Police also has&nbsp;a network of communication with them - in different forms - through emails or SMSes.&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything happens in a particular place, through an SMS broadcast, they will know what is happening in that area and be able to take steps to protect themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, there will also be exercises, checks, workshops and seminars, and so on.&nbsp; The Police is in close touch with them&nbsp;and we are going to expand such security watch groups because we find&nbsp;them very useful.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Members know,&nbsp;we have divided Singapore into several sectors,&nbsp;so that the Home Team agencies can work with the stakeholders in their different areas. They are mapping out the key partners in their respective&nbsp;areas and domains so that they know that, at every place,&nbsp;every building, who are the key people in charge.&nbsp; In that way, they will be able to reach out to those people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On traffic rules and why is it there are two different Ministries, the answer is quite simple:&nbsp;&nbsp;because the expertise required&nbsp;is quite different.&nbsp; Road building and road engineering obviously&nbsp;is not an expertise&nbsp;that MHA has. We are good&nbsp;at security. When it comes to road building and road engineering, we should depend on the Transport Ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;they design a road,&nbsp;in the way they have structured the road, and the way they have built the road, it can only take certain kinds of speed.&nbsp; So Police will have to take that into account as well.&nbsp; Does DIPS&nbsp;change&nbsp;driver behaviour?&nbsp; In fact, I just joked&nbsp;to somebody in the House not long ago that,&nbsp;if the public wants to change road behaviour, then they should be careful because there is no other effective way of changing road behaviour other than through&nbsp;DIPS&nbsp;and to take the driver off the road if he is a&nbsp;recalcitrant traffic offender.&nbsp; That is the most effective way of changing driver behaviour because he would no longer be able to drive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On fire safety, if&nbsp;Members look at the chart carefully, I think we have done very well. If we just look at the number of fire incidents, from 5,008 to 4,007 between 1994 and 2006, then,&nbsp;yes, the drop may not seem to be very large.&nbsp; But do not forget, in the last 12 years, from 1994 to now, how many more new buildings have come up?&nbsp; How many more new flats have come up during this 12-year period?&nbsp; Well, definitely a lot more than it was in 1994.&nbsp; But if&nbsp;we look at the fire incidents per 100,000 population, I think that is a better measure of how effective our fire safety education has been.&nbsp; It has dropped from 170 per 100,000 in 1994 to 105 in 2006, and that is a very significant drop.&nbsp; And, mind you, we are also a very compact place. All&nbsp;we need is one naughty boy or girl, like a brother and&nbsp;his sister who burn something over the window, and it happens to fall onto some clothes,&nbsp;we will find that all the clothes that are hung out there will be burnt. People who live in flats, in fact, anyone, whether&nbsp;he smokes or throws a burning charcoal or&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;over the rubbish chute, please be careful.&nbsp;&nbsp;He may not just burn other people's house down, he&nbsp;may burn his.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Ser Luck-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Ser Luck:</B> Sir, I am glad to know that there is some public education for the cyclists on&nbsp;road safety and how they should cycle safely on the road.

In my MPS on Wednesday, I came across a case where a taxi-driver was being charged for reckless driving because, according to him, it was the bicyclist who came into his path, a blind spot.&nbsp; He got knocked down but he was not hurt.&nbsp; But it was because the cyclist had damaged his taxi,&nbsp;that was why he made a U-turn back to go and look for the cyclist to ask for compensation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the cyclist called the police and said he was knocked down at a different location.&nbsp; So the police came and charged him for reckless driving.&nbsp; I have actually written to&nbsp;the Ministry&nbsp;on this.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My point is: &nbsp;is the Police so ready to believe that, in any road accident involving cyclists, whether motorcyclists or bicyclists, it is always the vehicle owner that is at fault, and not the cyclist, even though he&nbsp;could be the one who had been reckless?&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a question of who says what.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question is to DPM Wong.&nbsp; I am&nbsp;not criticising the police officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, they have been over-zealous. Again, on Wednesday, I have a resident coming to tell me that his brother, who is not mentally well and carries with him a letter from the doctor to say that he is mentally incapable,&nbsp;was found wandering in Ang Mo Kio at about 3&nbsp;or 4 am.&nbsp;When he was caught, despite being shown the letter that was dated in 2002 from the doctor to say that he was not mentally well, the Police, nevertheless, arrested him and charged him, and he had to bail him out.&nbsp; I was told that the letter was not accepted because it was outdated.&nbsp; In order to prove his brother is actually mentally unsound, he had to get a fresh letter from the doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is: &nbsp;are&nbsp;police officers not given that discretion to accept the letter from the doctor even though it may be dated a long time ago to show that this person is really not mentally well and, therefore, he could not be loitering or committing any offence?&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported that he was behaving suspiciously.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Sir, I do not know the&nbsp;reason why that particular resident had to be&nbsp;at that particular place at that hour.&nbsp; I also cannot give an answer as to why the Police charged him.&nbsp; But since Ms Lee has written to the Ministry, I suppose she will get a reply and she may know the answer.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We always encounter in our MPS cases,&nbsp;people who come and tell us one story.&nbsp; But it is like a coin, it has the other side of the story. Please remember that.&nbsp; For these two specific cases, I will leave them to the officials to look at them.&nbsp; If it comes to our attention, we will take a closer look and see whether there is any case to do something&nbsp;about it or not.&nbsp; Ultimately, prosecution depends on the Attorney-General, who is&nbsp;the Public Prosecutor.&nbsp; But, at the same time, the police officers just want to do a good job.&nbsp; I think we should not run&nbsp;them down on one or two incidents or for whatever reason there is, but if indeed they have neglected&nbsp;their duties and&nbsp;abused their powers, then that is something that we will not condone.&nbsp; But, like in every organisation, there will be some black sheep.&nbsp; We will identify them and we will take them out.&nbsp; Or if they can be changed, we will retain them.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar:</B> Sir, I would like to make two points.&nbsp; First, on the access to counsel.&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am talking about is in the interest of justice.&nbsp; Where counsel is excluded because investigations are not complete, the implication is that the involvement of counsel somehow subverts justice. Whatever you may think about lawyers, and some do not think much about us, it is often forgotten that we are officers of the court and we hold a higher duty to the court and to justice than to the client.&nbsp; I am for one uncomfortable with the suggestion that once we involve a lawyer, somehow justice is perverted.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is on the public confidence in the judicial&nbsp;system.&nbsp; I think the public has confidence and every reason to.&nbsp; But the issue is not about the system but the processes.&nbsp; And most Singaporeans have not been hauled up by the Police for questioning, thank goodness!&nbsp; But if we do a survey of those who have been, you will feel that the confidence is not as high.&nbsp; The reason&nbsp;is that&nbsp;anyone who has been questioned - and I have clients who have been - even if they are innocent, if they are going before the Police simply to tell them what happened, they come out feeling that they have done something wrong.&nbsp; And the reason is ---</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; So what is the point?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar:</B> The point is that the system has to be fair.&nbsp; We should have processes to ensure that the system is fair.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

If Police feels that&nbsp;allowing accused persons to see their lawyer will not hinder or hamper investigations, they will&nbsp;do so, even when investigations are not completed.&nbsp; In the past, when investigations were completed, the accused person was released and then, of course, he consulted his lawyer.&nbsp; Now, let us say, towards the end of one week, on the fifth or sixth day, even though Police may say, \"I have not completed my case\", but it will not hinder investigations, Police can consider letting the lawyer see the accused.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When&nbsp;an accused person sees&nbsp;his lawyer, at least he will have some assurance that there is a lawyer out there who represents him.&nbsp; Basically, the lawyer will tell the accused to tell the truth.&nbsp; So, if there is any allegation at that stage&nbsp;of any undue police pressure, the accused person can tell the lawyer that this is so.&nbsp; But we do not wish to&nbsp;complicate matters, because if&nbsp;we start allowing the lawyer to discuss the case&nbsp; -&nbsp; this is the experience of other countries&nbsp; - then it makes&nbsp;it harder to extract the truth.&nbsp; That is my starting point - basically, to get the truth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Really, an innocent person does not need a lawyer to tell the truth.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Ultimately, there is a limit to the number of people who will be made available to the Police Force.&nbsp; And from that number, we will then train them, assess them as they go through the deployment, to determine who has the ability, the quality and&nbsp;the mentality to be able to make a good police investigator.&nbsp;

They have done very proactive grassroots programmes&nbsp;with my grassroots to help the elderly, security programmes&nbsp;and crime prevention.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, when I recently asked for an emergency line for the deaf, a whole group of police officers who came to see me were very enthusiastic doing research and so forth.&nbsp; I think these are some very progressive behaviour that I feel should be highlighted to the others.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> In fact, one of the strategies that the Police adopts is proactive policing.&nbsp; This means that they go out, meet the public, talk to them, engage them and help those who need help.&nbsp; That is how they go about their work.&nbsp; Of course, I am not saying that all the 10,000 of them do the same thing.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;human beings like all of us.&nbsp; Some have their own weaknesses.&nbsp; Some, for whatever reason, may not have the right mood for the day.&nbsp; But we always demand high standards of them and we hope that they will carry the flag high for the Force, and set a good example and model for the rest of those who are lagging behind.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also counselling within the Force.&nbsp; The senior officers will keep watch and counsel those who are not keeping up with the task.&nbsp; There is a system of checks as well on the kind of cases that they deal with, whether they are behind time and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The systems are in place.&nbsp; But, ultimately, no matter what system we have, no matter what kind of training we have, it is the officer's own interest, his own motivation, his own values and his own enthusiasm in carrying out his task.&nbsp; That is why recruiting people is not so easy, and we have to find the right people to join us.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
