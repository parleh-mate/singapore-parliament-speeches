Anyone who suggests so ought\r\n\r\nto  have his head examined. We have a population of\r\n\r\ntwo million, quite vigorously reproductive, and  to\r\n\r\nsuggest a liberal attitude to immigration would  be\r\n\r\nto  court suicide for our growing economy  and  our\r\n\r\nability  to  provide  employment  for  our   fellow\r\n\r\ncitizens.  But  there is an aspect  of  immigration\r\n\r\nwhich   is   humanitarian  and  which   should   be\r\n\r\nconsidered  in its proper perspective.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nuncommon  for  a number of our citizens  to  go  to\r\n\r\nIndia.  They  used to go to China  too,  before  it\r\n\r\nbecame Communist, to visit their parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had it put to me, why should our citizens\r\n\r\nwho  desire  to  bring their aged parents  to  this\r\n\r\nisland  be prevented from doing so? It would  be  a\r\n\r\nhumanitarian  act to allow them to do so.  Besides,\r\n\r\nit would not put them in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\npossibly  invidious position of appearing  to  have\r\n\r\ndouble loyalty. Sir, there need be no apprehensions\r\n\r\nabout  immigration on this score. The  parents  who\r\n\r\ncome  in will not be economically active, nor would\r\n\r\nthey  be a liability to the State. They would  only\r\n\r\ncome  here to live out the rest of their days  with\r\n\r\ntheir  sons or daughters who can support  them.  To\r\n\r\nenable  them  to do so would be a humanitarian  act\r\n\r\nwhich   we  can  afford.  Nobody's  job   will   be\r\n\r\nendangered,  and all that we would be doing  is  to\r\n\r\nhave   the  parents  living  with  their  children.\r\n\r\nBesides,  this  will strengthen the  roots  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens of immigrant stock in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Immigration Department has\r\n\r\nbeen  singularly unsympathetic to appeals from  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  to let their aged parents come  in.  That\r\n\r\nthey  are  such  good  gate-keepers  is  worthy  of\r\n\r\ncommendation.  They do a good job for  us.  But  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the aged parents of citizens  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  the  Department should  relent  a  little\r\n\r\nbecause  it is humanitarian. And what is  far  more\r\n\r\nimportant in Singapore, where we have taken a  very\r\n\r\ngrim  and realistic attitude to life, is this, that\r\n\r\ntheir  presence here would not constitute a  threat\r\n\r\nto  the opportunities in the economic field to  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  this  country,  nor  would  they   be\r\n\r\nclaimants of social welfare benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, in many cases, money is sent by our\r\n\r\ncitizens  here  to their parents in their  homeland\r\n\r\nregularly.  This practice would cease,  of  course,\r\n\r\nshould their parents be permitted to migrate  here.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the question of allowing the  parents\r\n\r\nof  our  citizens  to  enter this  country  becomes\r\n\r\nattractive in this light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it were a harmful immigration - harmful in the\r\n\r\nsense that the economic opportunities of our people\r\n\r\nwould be threatened - then we would be the first to\r\n\r\nraise  a hue and cry against the idea. But we  have\r\n\r\ngiven  it sufficient thought and have come  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion that it would be a harmless immigration;\r\n\r\nin fact, there would be certain beneficial effects.\r\n\r\nThese beneficial effects could be that firmer roots\r\n\r\nwould be driven into this soil of our citizens  who\r\n\r\nat present out of love and affection for their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparents,  return home periodically. And they  would\r\n\r\nnot need to do so once their parents were here. And\r\n\r\nwhat  is  more,  there  would  be  a  decrease   in\r\n\r\nremittances abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has not taken us much imagination to see\r\n\r\nthat  we  could be kinder to our citizens  in  this\r\n\r\nregard  without  losing  anything  at  all  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess.  The gains have been mentioned. This  much\r\n\r\nwe  could do for our citizens in this country.  Our\r\n\r\nhistory is not made yet; it is still in the process\r\n\r\nof  being  made - the change from a colony  to  an\r\n\r\nindependent State. The immigration laws devised  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  economic welfare  of  the  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore have caused some amputations in the lives\r\n\r\nof  our people which could be amended with a little\r\n\r\nhumanity. And this is significant because  it  will\r\n\r\nnot cost anything at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope a little rethinking will be done about\r\n\r\nthis  matter  and  the  barriers  lifted  in  these\r\n\r\nspecial  cases. The immigration suggested will  not\r\n\r\namount  to a large influx, and I think in the  last\r\n\r\nanalysis we can afford a little humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I fully sympathise with what has been\r\n\r\nsaid  by  the Member for Bras Basah concerning  the\r\n\r\nadmission of aged parents of Singapore citizens. We\r\n\r\nhave   laid   down  certain  rules  on  which   the\r\n\r\nController of Immigration would be able  to  arrive\r\n\r\nat  a  decision as to whether applications will  be\r\n\r\npermitted or not. I agree with him that persons of.\r\n\r\n60  years  of  age and over will  not  in  any  way\r\n\r\ncompete  with Singapore citizens for jobs or  other\r\n\r\nforms of employment. But, at the same time, it must\r\n\r\nalso  he remembered that it has been our experience\r\n\r\nthat persons who have sought the admission of their\r\n\r\naged  parents,  either from India  or  China,  have\r\n\r\neventually found themselves unable to support their\r\n\r\ngrowing  families. The Ministry of  Social  Affairs\r\n\r\nthus  finds  its  list  of supplicants  for  public\r\n\r\nassistance has been growing longer and longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe - I am quite sure that all Members\r\n\r\nsubscribe  to  this belief - that  the  concept  of\r\n\r\nfilial  piety is very strong among us, particularly\r\n\r\namong  the  Chinese. Therefore, cases  have  always\r\n\r\nbeen dealt with sympathetically whenever we receive\r\n\r\napplications for the admission of aged parents.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  I would inform the House that the number  of\r\n\r\napplications  for aged parents to be  permitted  to\r\n\r\nenter  Singapore  was most during the  years  1958,\r\n\r\n1959  and  1960. But since then there  has  been  a\r\n\r\ngradual  decline.  In  a  way,  this  reflects  the\r\n\r\ngreater  stability of the population of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthat  fewer people now look towards the origins  of\r\n\r\ntheir birth-place, and many more have more or  less\r\n\r\nregarded  Singapore  as their  homeland  and  their\r\n\r\nloyalties  are  to this country. Hence  an \r\n\r\ninward-looking attitude has developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1958, there were about 800 odd applications.\r\n\r\nIn  1959, there were slightly over 950 applications\r\n\r\nfor  admission  of aged parents. I  must  say  that\r\n\r\nthese  applications will, of course, be  considered\r\n\r\nonly  if  they  come from Singapore citizens.  \r\n\r\nNon-citizens  do  not have the right either  under  our\r\n\r\ncitizenship  laws  or  under  immigration  laws  to\r\n\r\nsponsor the admission of their parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the number of admissions has\r\n\r\nconsiderably reduced. In 1960 it was just  slightly\r\n\r\nover  400.  In 1961, it was down to 260.  In  1964,\r\n\r\nwhen  immigration was not under my control but  had\r\n\r\nmoved over to the Central Government of Malaysia in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur, it was just about 100 odd. All  this\r\n\r\ngoes  to  prove that all those citizens  who  would\r\n\r\nhave  their  aged parents come into  Singapore  had\r\n\r\nalready taken the opportunity in 1958 and 1959, and\r\n\r\nthat  many  more  Singaporeans today  are  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  There  was a time  when  a  substantial\r\n\r\nnumber  of  our citizens were born overseas.  Their\r\n\r\nparents were overseas. Consequently, they had their\r\n\r\nties overseas, but many of these ties have now been\r\n\r\nbroken because, as time goes by, their parents pass\r\n\r\naway.  Therefore, it is not quite true that we  now\r\n\r\nhave  as large a stream of remittances sent  abroad\r\n\r\nto sustain aged parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one other point which we have to\r\n\r\nmake,  and that is, Singapore citizens who wish  to\r\n\r\nseek  the  admission  of their  parents  must  also\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the  Controller that their parents  depend\r\n\r\nupon  them  solely for support and  sustenance.  If\r\n\r\nthey  have  other relatives, brothers,  sisters  or\r\n\r\nother members of the family overseas, who are  also\r\n\r\nsupporting their parents, then, of course, there is\r\n\r\nno  logical reason at all why entry permits  should\r\n\r\nbe  given to such people. Nevertheless, in spite of\r\n\r\nall  these rules which we have drafted to guide the\r\n\r\nController of Immigration, I must say that we  have\r\n\r\nalways   considered  these  applications   from   a\r\n\r\nsympathetic  light, and while we  admit  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  be a competitive factor in our  task  to\r\n\r\nlook  for jobs for Singapore citizens, nevertheless\r\n\r\nthere  are also other problems, like housing, which\r\n\r\nhave to be considered as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to assure the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  that we have not been very strict or  severe\r\n\r\nin  the  consideration of entry  permits  for  aged\r\n\r\nparents, provided certain requirements can  be  met\r\n\r\nby  the sponsors - that they are our citizens, that\r\n\r\nthey  are  in a position to support their  parents,\r\n\r\nand  that  the parents solely depend upon them  for\r\n\r\nsustenance.  Otherwise,  there  has  been  no  real\r\n\r\ndifficulty in considering this problem of admitting\r\n\r\naged parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

Unfortunately, buses to serve the\r\n\r\npeople  in  housing  estates,  such  as  MacPherson\r\n\r\nEstate,  have  not been seen up  to  today.  It  is\r\n\r\ndifficult   to   understand  how  the   appropriate\r\n\r\nauthorities carry out their duties. The  MacPherson\r\n\r\nEstate  has  long been in existence. The  residents\r\n\r\nthere very much require a bus service, particularly\r\n\r\nfor  their  school-going children.  These  children\r\n\r\nhave to walk for half a mile or three-quarters of a\r\n\r\nmile  to get to the main road in order to get to  a\r\n\r\nbus  stop.  If  the housing authorities  can  build\r\n\r\nthese  flats so easily, why is it that the Registry\r\n\r\nof Vehicles cannot attend to the provision of a bus\r\n\r\nservice  for these estates? We must not keep  quiet\r\n\r\nabout  this  matter  and  allow  children  in   the\r\n\r\nMacPherson Estate to go on foot in order to get  to\r\n\r\na  bus  stop.  I  hope this matter  will  be  given\r\n\r\nweighty consideration by the Registrar of Vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authorities should realise that the\r\n\r\npopulation is growing, although the number of taxis\r\n\r\nis  still  the same as before. The matter  of  taxi\r\n\r\nlicence plates should also be considered so that it\r\n\r\nwould  not be monopolised by one or two individuals\r\n\r\nonly.  If possible, Mr Speaker, Sir, every  person\r\n\r\nshould  be  allowed a limited issue of one  or  two\r\n\r\ntaxi licence plates, because the opportunity should\r\n\r\nbe  given  to the people of the State to have  taxi\r\n\r\nlicence  plates in order to earn their  livelihood.\r\n\r\nThere  are many exploiters who wish to get as  many\r\n\r\ntaxi  licence plates as possible. It is up  to  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  to  control the issue  of  taxi  licence\r\n\r\nplates so that it would not be given to only a  few\r\n\r\npersons.  If a regulation is made whereby only  one\r\n\r\nplate   is   issued  to  an  applicant,  then   the\r\n\r\nopportunity for the exploiters to carry  out  their\r\n\r\nmisdeeds  may  be limited. I can say that  this  is\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  the  system of the Ali  Baba  type  of\r\n\r\nbusiness.  The  exploiter  would  get  the  licence\r\n\r\nplates  under his own name, under his wife's  name,\r\n\r\nand under his children's names. So I trust that the\r\n\r\nregulations  will  be  put  into  force  so  as  to\r\n\r\nregulate the issue of taxi licence plates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should do away with the old colonial system\r\n\r\nand have a system that is suitable for the present\r\n\r\npopulation  of the country.

The figures are fantastic\r\n\r\n-  so  many  more drivers than available vehicles.\r\n\r\nAnyone can see that there is such a ripe field for\r\n\r\nexploitation, especially when it is known that the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  taxi  drivers  are  not  owners   of\r\n\r\nvehicles.  What  is  the  net  result  of  such  a\r\n\r\ngrotesque   disproportion  between  vehicles   and\r\n\r\ndrivers?  It  is  that  the  owners  of  vehicles,\r\n\r\nknowing that there will be a competition from  the\r\n\r\nthousands of taxi drivers for their vehicles, will\r\n\r\npush  up  their rentals for them and lay down  all\r\n\r\nsorts of conditions. The taxi drivers will have no\r\n\r\nalternative hut to accept the conditions  and  the\r\n\r\nrentals  laid down by the owners, rather than  put\r\n\r\nup  with the disgrace of unemployment. But what we\r\n\r\nwould like to know is how things have been allowed\r\n\r\nto  get  out of hand in such a manner, and who  is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for this mess? Or has  somebody  felt\r\n\r\nthat  by doing so we will be increasing employment\r\n\r\nopportunities? It is as plain as A, B, C  that  if\r\n\r\nyou  increase  the number of taxi  drivers,  there\r\n\r\nmust   be  a  corresponding  number  of  vehicles.\r\n\r\nOtherwise  taxi owners are the only ones  who  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to profit, after squeezing the taxi drivers\r\n\r\nby high demands on them, because of the paucity of\r\n\r\nvehicles. Sir, I wonder if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  questions did engage those responsible  for\r\n\r\nthis situation. I suppose there is no need for  me\r\n\r\nto  wonder  whether  they did, because  the  sorry\r\n\r\nsituation tells an eloquent story of neglect.  Now\r\n\r\nthe cure at the moment is increasing the number of\r\n\r\nvehicle  licences  and  a temporary  halt  to  the\r\n\r\nissuance  of  licences to taxi  drivers  till  the\r\n\r\nsituation is reassessed. The long-term cure is the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of  an organisation  to  enable  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  to own their own vehicles. The  time  has\r\n\r\ncome to think in such terms if taxi drivers are to\r\n\r\nearn a livelihood without exploitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the question\r\n\r\nof  bus  services  as raised  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kapor,  I would like to state  that  this\r\n\r\nmatter  will  be got over with in  a  short  time.\r\n\r\nBuses  are  allowed to run only on  public  roads.\r\n\r\nThere  are many places where the roads are private\r\n\r\nroads.

So it goes  on  for  other\r\n\r\nmembers  of the police, Mr B, Mr C, etc. That  is\r\n\r\nwhat I mean by \"empty loans\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher officers had asked members of the\r\n\r\npolice force to take up loans in order to cover  up\r\n\r\nthe loss.

Two  clerks\r\n\r\nattached  to  this  Society have  vanished.  It  is\r\n\r\npossible  that they have received advice indirectly\r\n\r\nor  even  directly  from the Registrar,  acting  in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with senior police officers,  to  pave\r\n\r\nthe  way to terminate their services.

The\r\n\r\nadministrators  of  the  Police  Thrift  and   Loan\r\n\r\nSociety have acted in contravention of regulations.\r\n\r\nBut  even  more  deplorable is the failure  of  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Co-operative Societies to carry out  a\r\n\r\nproper   supervision  of  the  management  of   the\r\n\r\nSociety,   thereby  jeopardising  the  smooth   and\r\n\r\nefficient development of the co-operative  movement\r\n\r\nin Singapore as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel it is not right that\r\n\r\nsome  tens of members of the police force  who  had\r\n\r\nnothing  to do with the loss are forced to  take  a\r\n\r\nblank loan in order to cover up the money which has\r\n\r\ngone astray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I hope that the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned can find  a  way  out,  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the co-operative movement as a whole in\r\n\r\nthe  State and with the co-operation of the police,\r\n\r\nin  respect of the question of re-payments  of  the\r\n\r\nloans  which  had been taken out under pressure  by\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Police Thrift and Loan Society  in\r\n\r\norder to cover up the affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nKampong Kapor has made somewhat serious allegations\r\n\r\nagainst the Registrar of Co-operative Societies. At\r\n\r\none  moment,  he  referred  to  the  Registrar   of\r\n\r\nSocieties. I would like to make it clear,  however,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Registrar of Societies  does  not  conic\r\n\r\nunder  my  Ministry  but,  I  believe,  under   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture  and  Social  Affairs.  I  am\r\n\r\nresponsible   for  the  Registry  of   Co-operative\r\n\r\nSocieties. The Member quoted a newspaper report  of\r\n\r\nearly  March stating that investigations were being\r\n\r\nmade   into  these  allegations,  and  then  quoted\r\n\r\nanother  report of the 20th of March  which  denied\r\n\r\nthat  these investigations were in fact being made.\r\n\r\nWhat  the  truth of this matter is, I do not  know,\r\n\r\nbut if the learned Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  prepared to supply me with more particulars and\r\n\r\ninformation in respect of his allegations, I assure\r\n\r\nhim  that  proper investigations will be  made  and\r\n\r\nappropriate  action taken against  anyone  who  has\r\n\r\ncommitted  a breach of trust or run away  with  any\r\n\r\npart of the Society's funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I point out, Mr Speaker, Sir, that these co-operative societies must file audited accounts\r\n\r\nevery  year, and unless these accounts are correct,\r\n\r\nsomeone must explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwith regard to what has been stated by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Law and National Development, I am prepared  to\r\n\r\ngive him further particulars regarding the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Within  seven\r\n\r\nyears of birth, a copy of the original extract  has\r\n\r\nto  be obtained from the Registry. The Registry  of\r\n\r\nBirths  is  situated  in  Empress  Place.   It   is\r\n\r\ninconvenient  for  people living  in  the  outlying\r\n\r\nareas,  such  as  in the islands,  Changi,  Seletar\r\n\r\nNaval  Base,  to come to Empress Place  to  get  an\r\n\r\nextract of the Registration of Birth. They have  to\r\n\r\nmiss a day's work and incur transport expenses.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  they have to pay $2 to the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nBirths  for  an extract. If the Minister  concerned\r\n\r\nwould consider\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseriously this matter to have many branches of this\r\n\r\nRegistry,  then the work of the Registry  could  be\r\n\r\ndecentralised in the outlying areas and it would be\r\n\r\nconvenient for the people living in these areas  to\r\n\r\nget their extracts of Registration of Birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter concerns the Registry of\r\n\r\nPersons.  I believe it deals with matters connected\r\n\r\nwith  the  issue  of identity cards.  Soon  plastic\r\n\r\nidentity cards will be issued. It is hoped that the\r\n\r\nerrors  which appear on our present identity  cards\r\n\r\nwill  not  recur. The names on the  identity  cards\r\n\r\nhave often been misspelt. It is hoped that when the\r\n\r\nnew  plastic identity cards are issued,  the  names\r\n\r\nappearing therein will be the same as those on  the\r\n\r\nextracts of the Registration of Birth. If  this  is\r\n\r\nnot  done, then the clerks will be writing down the\r\n\r\nnames  according to their own way of spelling.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  my name is Mahmud. The correct  spelling\r\n\r\nis  `M-a-h-m-u-d'.  But the clerk  who  is  English\r\n\r\neducated, on hearing my name, may spell it as \r\n\r\n`M-a-h-m-o-o-d'.  So  may be the case  with  names  like\r\n\r\nYaacob,  Khamis, Mohamed Shah, and others. So  also\r\n\r\nmay  be  the  case  with Chinese names.  Take,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, Chan Chee Seng. The way I would spell  it\r\n\r\nis `C-h-a-n C-h-i S-i-n-g'. There are other ways of\r\n\r\nspelling  it according to the way it is pronounced.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the Government will make it necessary  for\r\n\r\nthe Chinese characters to be written down too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why I bring this matter up, Mr Speaker, Sir, is\r\n\r\nthis;  when  the  time comes to make  requests  for\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of provident fund or other such matters,\r\n\r\nthe  name on the identity card and the name on  the\r\n\r\nextract  of  Registration of Birth are quite  often\r\n\r\ndifferent.  For  instance, the  name  Ahmad  Taff.\r\n\r\nSometimes  the  name Ahmad is spelt  as  A-h-m-a-d.\r\n\r\nThere  are others who spell it as A-h-m-a-t,  which\r\n\r\nalso is Ahmad. And Taff could be misspelt as\r\n\r\nT-o-u-g-h. Perhaps the correct spelling is Taff. Probably\r\n\r\nTaff is derived from the word \"attap\". So there  is\r\n\r\na wide difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  the  name is spelt in various ways,  then  that\r\n\r\nleads to difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I merely wish to\r\n\r\ntouch  a  little  on the Registry of  Persons.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour will be issuing plastic identity\r\n\r\ncards,  and  I  wish to draw the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned to this matter,  so  that  when\r\n\r\nplastic identity cards are issued, people who  have\r\n\r\nnot  changed their addresses will have the  changes\r\n\r\nduly made. In my constituency, for instance, before\r\n\r\nthe  construction of Airport Road, Kampong Ann Teng\r\n\r\nwas known as Lorong Tai Seng. But after the Airport\r\n\r\nRoad  was  built, the eastern part of the  road  is\r\n\r\ncalled Jalan Ann Teng, and the rest is still called\r\n\r\nLorong  Tai Seng. So it is hoped that the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  will bear this in mind  so  that  when\r\n\r\nplastic identity cards are issued, this point  will\r\n\r\nhave   been  clarified  and  the  changes  in   the\r\n\r\naddresses of the people made, because most  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  affected are farmers and vegetable growers,\r\n\r\nand they do not understand the matter well. I hope,\r\n\r\ntherefore, that the Minister for Labour will give a\r\n\r\nfull explanation to settlers in Jalan Ann Teng  who\r\n\r\nnumber  not  less  than 2,000,  so  that  they  can\r\n\r\nunderstand the position when the new identity cards\r\n\r\nare issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,\r\n\r\nI would like to reply to the criticisms made by the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Kapor in respect of the Registry\r\n\r\nof  Births and Deaths. He says that there  is  some\r\n\r\ninconvenience  caused  to  people  living  in   the\r\n\r\noutlying  areas  of the island and  also  to  those\r\n\r\nstaying in the Southern Islands who have to come to\r\n\r\nthe   Registry  to  change  their  temporary  birth\r\n\r\ncertificates into permanent ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him that there are some difficulties\r\n\r\ncaused  to  these people when they come from  their\r\n\r\nhomes  to  town  to  have their birth  certificates\r\n\r\nchanged.  I  think his suggestion  that  we  should\r\n\r\nbranch out into these areas to provide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch services to these people is a very good one. I\r\n\r\nwill look into this matter fully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case there have been instances where\r\n\r\nin  these  outlying areas community centre  leaders\r\n\r\nhave  collected these temporary birth  certificates\r\n\r\nand have come to the Registry to apply on behalf of\r\n\r\nthese  parents.  This  is, I  think,  a  very  good\r\n\r\nservice  also  and  we will also  encourage  it  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the criticisms of the Registry of Persons\r\n\r\nin  regard to mistakes in the spelling of names  on\r\n\r\nidentity  cards, I can assure the  Member  that  in\r\n\r\nfuture,  when re-registration is carried  out,  his\r\n\r\nname will he spelt to his full satisfaction on  his\r\n\r\nplastic identity card. In any case, we are going to\r\n\r\ntake  great  pains  to make sure  that  all  names,\r\n\r\nwhether  they are Chinese names or Malay  names  or\r\n\r\nIndian  names,  will he given proper  study  before\r\n\r\nthey  are  written on the new identity cards.  Even\r\n\r\nunder the present system, if a man is not satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  the spelling of his name, he can always apply\r\n\r\nto have his alias written on his identity card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the remarks made by the Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan,  regarding wrong addresses  in  identity\r\n\r\ncards  at  present, I agree with him  that  in  the\r\n\r\npast,  when these identity cards were issued  in  a\r\n\r\nhurry  to  meet  the emergency situation  in  1948,\r\n\r\nthere  were  not very strict conditions  laid  down\r\n\r\nabout  the  filling  up  of these  identity  cards,\r\n\r\nespecially the names and addresses of the  holders.\r\n\r\nBut  in future, before our re-registration campaign\r\n\r\nis  carried  out, we will send teams  to  areas  to\r\n\r\ninform  the  residents of the correct address,  the\r\n\r\nname  of  the street where they live, so that  when\r\n\r\nthey come to the registration centre, they can give\r\n\r\nthe  registration  officer the correct  number  and\r\n\r\naddress of their house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the National Registration Bill which\r\n\r\nis  going to be read a Second time tomorrow,  there\r\n\r\nis  a  clause to compel the report of a  change  of\r\n\r\naddress  within 14 days.

It is rather surprising to  note\r\n\r\nthat  the  gravity of Communism can  descend  into\r\n\r\nsuch shambles as a free-for-all.

For instance, if the leader\r\n\r\nof   one  camp,  the  uncompromising  camp,  said,\r\n\r\n\"Singapore's independence is phoney; we will  have\r\n\r\nto  establish the phoney character of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependence  before anything else,\"  And  a  chap\r\n\r\nfrom  the other camp said, \"There is nothing wrong\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore's independence. We start from that\r\n\r\nbasis,\"  and  he received a bash on the  head  for\r\n\r\nthat,  it would clear up the minds of some of  our\r\n\r\npeople  here who have not decided one way  or  the\r\n\r\nother.

This  was  under\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule.  Guilty and  innocent  feared  them\r\n\r\nequally, for they were then a truculent lot and the\r\n\r\ncommon   ordinary  people  in  Singapore   suffered\r\n\r\nterrible indignities at their hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Malaysia, there was a relapse apparently,\r\n\r\nwhen a journalist in broad daylight performing  his\r\n\r\nduty  was man-handled in a very rough fashion. This\r\n\r\nincident,   to   our   considerable   regret,   was\r\n\r\nwhitewashed and it is now an ugly memory. That  was\r\n\r\nunder  Malaysia  and it was the only  jolt  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess which we had started in 1959 of orientating\r\n\r\nthe  police to the fact that they were dealing with\r\n\r\ntheir  own people and not serving colonial masters.\r\n\r\nThose who could not change their old attitudes,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, had to go, and was good riddance. We had no\r\n\r\nplace  for  such  bullies  in  Singapore  which  is\r\n\r\ncommitted to making life pleasant and agreeable for\r\n\r\nits  humblest  Citizens. There  was  no  place  for\r\n\r\npolice brutality and callousness. They were of  the\r\n\r\nold  order  and were identified with  the  colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment and were perhaps one of the very  strong\r\n\r\nreasons for doing away with colonial rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this is supposed to have changed with\r\n\r\nself-government and independence. But I am afraid\r\n\r\nthat some dark\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorners still exist. It has been represented to  me\r\n\r\nthat  the  traffic police are displaying a singular\r\n\r\ncallousness to the problems of taxi-drivers.  \r\n\r\nTaxi-plying is not a lucrative profession as it used  to\r\n\r\nbe  in  the  colonial rule where it  had  been  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of colonial government to limit the  number\r\n\r\nof  taxis, and the fortunate small number of  \r\n\r\ntaxi-drivers  earned good money. But now it  has  become\r\n\r\ndifferent with the accent we have given to creating\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities. With the issuance of more\r\n\r\ntaxi-driving licences, taxi-earnings are  not  what\r\n\r\nthey  used to be. On the average, they earn between\r\n\r\n$7  and  $8 per day. In this connection,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nfines  imposed  by the police take  on  an  inhuman\r\n\r\naspect  for  minor offences which  are  settled  by\r\n\r\ncompounding. As much as $20 is fined  for  a  first\r\n\r\noffence   and  subsequent  fines  are  higher.   As\r\n\r\nPresident  of the N.T.U.C., my ears are  full  with\r\n\r\nrepresentations from taxi-drivers asking the police\r\n\r\nto  reduce  their  fines to a rate consistent  with\r\n\r\ntheir  earning capacity. In other words,  they  are\r\n\r\nasking  the police to have a heart, not to  extract\r\n\r\ntoo   heavily  from  their  meagre  earnings.   The\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. feels, therefore, that a system should  be\r\n\r\nintroduced whereby a warning is issued to  a  first\r\n\r\noffender,  and  small  fines  consistent  with  the\r\n\r\nnature of the offence and with the earning capacity ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

If  there are any  inhumanities,  then\r\n\r\nthey must be removed and, in my opinion, the system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  fines operated by the police bears too  heavily\r\n\r\non  the  poor taxi-drivers. I therefore think  they\r\n\r\nmust   be  modified.  I  am  not  for  one   moment\r\n\r\nsuggesting that the fines must be removed, but they\r\n\r\ncan be modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic offences are a part of the occupational\r\n\r\nrisks  of  taxi-drivers, but  it  is  too  cruel  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent to apply high fines for minor offences as\r\n\r\ncrossing over a red light or parking near  a  white\r\n\r\nline. I hope appropriate attention will be given by\r\n\r\nthe  authorities,  because this is  being  said  in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There appears to be another cruel activity of the\r\n\r\npolice  in that they are hounding taxi-drivers  for\r\n\r\nan offence such as excessive smoking. Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nknow  whether such an offence of excessive  smoking\r\n\r\nis  under the charge of the Traffic Police  or  the\r\n\r\nR.O.V. Anyway, I hope the Ministers concerned  will\r\n\r\nheed  my warning about this and hope that they  pay\r\n\r\nspecial  attention, whoever they may be.  In  truth\r\n\r\nand  in  fairness, they should hound the owners  of\r\n\r\nthe  taxis who are the real culprits and who  never\r\n\r\ndo  anything  about  appropriate repairs,  although\r\n\r\nthey  are told so by the drivers to whom they  rent\r\n\r\nout their vehicles at exorbitant rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the owner and the police, the taxi-driver\r\n\r\nis  between the devil and the deep sea. The cruelty\r\n\r\nreaches  enormous proportions when the  taxi-driver\r\n\r\nis  made to shell out as much as $80 as a fine  for\r\n\r\nthe  smoking  offence.  Meanwhile,  the  owner  who\r\n\r\nextracts  a high rental for the car sits smugly  at\r\n\r\nhome  raking  in  his money from  several  cars,  I\r\n\r\nsuppose, while the poor wretch has to shell out the\r\n\r\n$80.  What exacerbates the matter is that I am sure\r\n\r\nthe  police  are  conversant  with  this  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs, but they do precious little about  booking\r\n\r\nthe  real  culprits who perhaps would not feel  the\r\n\r\npinch even if they were fined several times more. I\r\n\r\nbelieve if the police want to do some milking, they\r\n\r\nshould get the milch cows - the owners of the taxis\r\n\r\n-  and  not  the threadbare taxi-drivers,  who  can\r\n\r\nhardly  make a day's living. I hope these  problems\r\n\r\nof  taxi-drivers  on which I have  enlightened  the\r\n\r\nHouse will receive the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsympathetic  attention of the  police,  that  there\r\n\r\nwill  be an end to the inhuman persecution  of  the\r\n\r\ntaxi-drivers, and that they will be allowed to earn\r\n\r\na  living  in  the same manner as the  majority  of\r\n\r\nworkers in Singapore - unoppressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to sum up, I hope I have painted a lurid\r\n\r\npicture of the exploitation of taxi-drivers and the\r\n\r\nharassment they suffer at the hands of the  police,\r\n\r\nbecause  it was my intention to do so. We hope  the\r\n\r\nremedies   will  come  because  the  situation   is\r\n\r\ndeteriorating  and, furthermore, intolerable  to  a\r\n\r\n\"movement\" which prides itself on having solved the\r\n\r\nproblems of workers to a very successful extent.  I\r\n\r\nhope  you,  Mr Speaker, will not pull  me  out  of\r\n\r\norder  again  when  I mention the  word  \"movement\"\r\n\r\nbecause  I  have  to make it clear that  the  \r\n\r\nTaxi-Drivers' Association  is  an  affiliate of the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems of taxi-drivers are not ones that\r\n\r\ndefy  solution.

The\r\n\r\nfines  on taxi-drivers are too heavy, but they  are\r\n\r\nnecessary.  Just  yesterday as I was  driving  very\r\n\r\nslowly out of this Parliament House the driver of a\r\n\r\ntaxi,  whose  number I had taken  down,  could  not\r\n\r\ncontain  his patience but kept on hooting his  horn\r\n\r\nand  he overtook from the left-hand side of my car.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, this is the sort of  taxi-driver\r\n\r\nthat  should  be punished. I am only  stressing  on\r\n\r\nsuch reckless drivers. But those who are constantly\r\n\r\ncareful  in their driving and earning their  living\r\n\r\nproperly should be given consideration, but not all\r\n\r\ntaxi-drivers.  At  the same time,  if  taxi-drivers\r\n\r\npark  their  vehicles anywhere  they  like  and  go\r\n\r\nagainst traffic lights, and so on -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the number of vehicles in Singapore is\r\n\r\nabout  103,000, if I am correct - if  this  sort  of\r\n\r\nuncontrolled  traffic  is  allowed  to  go  on   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I think the lives of you, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nand  Members of Parliament will be in danger.

I therefore urge that\r\n\r\nall  taxi-drivers be a hit more careful in  future.\r\n\r\nIf  the police are able to curb pirate taxis  which\r\n\r\nare  competing with taxis, then I am sure that this\r\n\r\ncomplex  problem  will  be solved.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nfines  on  taxi-drivers should be imposed according\r\n\r\nto the nature of the offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\njoin  the  Member  for Bras Basah in  raising  this\r\n\r\nquestion  of  taxis.  The  Member  for  Changi  has\r\n\r\nmentioned  just  now  his personal  experience.  He\r\n\r\nfeels  that  the taxi-driver who has  committed  an\r\n\r\noffence  knew  what he was doing.  The  taxi-driver\r\n\r\nknew that the Member for Changi is a P.A.P. Member,\r\n\r\nand  I believe that the taxi-driver is a member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis. Naturally, taxi-drivers  who\r\n\r\nare  Barisan Sosialis members and taxi-drivers  who\r\n\r\nare  P.A.P, members like to block one  another  or\r\n\r\nclash with one another when they meet. This problem\r\n\r\ncould be left to the police to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has suggested that the\r\n\r\nfines  should  be in line with the  nature  of  the\r\n\r\noffences  committed by taxi-drivers.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nexample given by the Member for Bras Basah:  for  a\r\n\r\ncar  smoking offence, the fine will be $40 or  $50.\r\n\r\nNaturally  this  is  not  commensurate   with   the\r\n\r\noffence.  That is what is asked for by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Bras Basah regarding fines and taxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I was a bit taken aback by the  Member  for Bras Basah when \r\n\r\nhe said  that  the Police  Force  is  harassing taxi-drivers  and  the\r\n\r\npublic  in general, and that we are exploiting  the\r\n\r\ntaxi-drivers'  earnings in order to supplement  our\r\n\r\nrevenue.  I am sure that is never the intention  of\r\n\r\nthe department, and this has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnever  been the policy of the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nof our Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the crux of the matter\r\n\r\nis  that  it  is  up to the drivers  themselves  to\r\n\r\nobserve  traffic rules. From what  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nBras  Basah has said, it appears that there  is  no\r\n\r\ndispute  that they have committed a breach  of  the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Ordinance. Therefore, there is no question\r\n\r\nthat  the  police  are harassing taxi-drivers.  The\r\n\r\nfact  is  that taxi-drivers are committing  traffic\r\n\r\noffences. It is the duty of the police to see  that\r\n\r\nlaws are being observed, particularly when children\r\n\r\nand workers are using the road. The police have  to\r\n\r\nsee that motorists who are using the road are not a\r\n\r\nmenace  to  pedestrians or cyclists, or,  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter,  to  the  motorists  themselves.   In   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the police will have to see that the\r\n\r\nrules are observed by everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of fines being\r\n\r\nimposed  by  the police, I understand  the  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice Department has been very considerate towards\r\n\r\ntaxi-drivers.  Those  who have  committed  a  first\r\n\r\nminor  offence  are  usually  given  a  letter   of\r\n\r\nwarning.  But  for  those  who  repeatedly   commit\r\n\r\noffences  under  the  Traffic  Ordinance,  in   the\r\n\r\ninterest of the public and the safety of the \r\n\r\nroad-users, a deterrent penalty will have to be imposed.\r\n\r\nSo I would say that if taxi-drivers do not like the\r\n\r\nfines  being imposed on them by the Traffic Police,\r\n\r\nit  is  up  to  them, especially the Taxi  Drivers'\r\n\r\nAssociation, to promote a campaign of good driving.\r\n\r\nI  think  this  is  the  basic  solution  to  their\r\n\r\ncomplaint.  Probably the N.T.U.C. can organise  the\r\n\r\ncampaign, and I am sure the Traffic Police will  be\r\n\r\nprepared to co-operate with them to launch it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emitting of excessive smoke is an offence\r\n\r\nunder  the  Ordinance administered by the Registrar\r\n\r\nof Vehicles. I am not in a position to clarify this\r\n\r\nmatter. On the suggestion that the owners of  taxis\r\n\r\nshould  be  made to take the responsibility  rather\r\n\r\nthan  the  drivers, I am told that this  point  has\r\n\r\nbeen taken note of by the department concerned, and\r\n\r\nit  may well be that amendments will be made to the\r\n\r\npresent Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to make\r\n\r\nmy  point clear to the Member for Changi as well as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister of State of Defence.

Alexandra Hill Estate, and Bukit Ho\r\n\r\nSwee Estate. The sum that is required for this vote\r\n\r\nas  reimbursement for the Housing Board amounts  to\r\n\r\n$122,526.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,I further understand that the\r\n\r\nconstruction of these covered pitches was  approved\r\n\r\nby the former Minister for Health in 1963 for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurpose  of re-siting unauthorised roadside  stalls\r\n\r\nbuilt  by  hawkers  which  caused  obstruction   to\r\n\r\ntraffic and impediment to health and cleansing work\r\n\r\nin the various housing estates. The Government must\r\n\r\nhe  praised  for  having  provided  these  roadside\r\n\r\nhawkers  with all the facilities of proper  hawking\r\n\r\npitches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to draw the attention of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health to this - that  the  control\r\n\r\nand  supervision of these covered  pitches  by  the\r\n\r\nMarkets and Hawkers Department of the Public Health\r\n\r\nDivision  is  far  from satisfactory.  Very  often,\r\n\r\npitches  are left vacant for months and  are  never\r\n\r\nallocated  when they are applied for by  unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers.  In  Tanjong Rhu Estate, which  is  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency,  the  covered  pitches,  as  I   have\r\n\r\nobserved  from time to time, are not fully utilised\r\n\r\nand  many  of  them are more often  than  not  left\r\n\r\nunoccupied.  Some  of  them,  I  am  informed,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, have actually been allocated but have\r\n\r\nnever  been  physically occupied by  licensees  who\r\n\r\nregularly  pay  up their licence fees.  So  far  no\r\n\r\naction  has  ever  been taken by  the  Markets  and\r\n\r\nHawkers Department to rectify this irregularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this state of affairs is indeed\r\n\r\nvery  undesirable  as  there  are  some  bona  tide\r\n\r\nhawkers who wish to be allotted pitches to  make  a\r\n\r\ndecent  living. When they apply to the Markets  and\r\n\r\nHawkers Department, they are often told that  there\r\n\r\nare no vacancies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,I should he grateful,\r\n\r\ntherefore, if the Minister for Health would  kindly\r\n\r\nenlighten  me and this House whether he would  take\r\n\r\nappropriate  steps  to implement effective  control\r\n\r\nand  supervision of hawker pitches not only in  the\r\n\r\nvarious housing estates in my constituency but also\r\n\r\nin other housing estates in other constituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I admit with regret that most of  the\r\n\r\ncriticisms   levelled  by  the  hon.   Member   for\r\n\r\nMountbatten against the present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHawkers Department of the Public Health Division of\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry of ineffective control and supervision\r\n\r\nof  hawkers are unfortunately true. That is why  it\r\n\r\nwas  necessary  for me to appoint an  officer  from\r\n\r\nanother  Ministry,  i.e. the  Director  of  Central\r\n\r\nComplaints  Bureau  of  the  Ministry   of   Social\r\n\r\nAffairs,  to  he  the  officer-in-charge   of \r\n\r\nre-organisation  of  the Hawkers  Department  as  from\r\n\r\nNovember last year, a year ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general survey was made in May this year of\r\n\r\nmarkets  and  pitches which revealed  that  out  of\r\n\r\n8,269  stalls in 42 Government markets, only  6,493\r\n\r\nstalls or 80 per cent were taken up, leaving  1,776\r\n\r\nstalls  or nearly 20 per cent not taken up at  all.\r\n\r\nThis  is  only  the  overall  picture.  In  certain\r\n\r\nmarkets, they are half-empty, like the Maxwell Road\r\n\r\nmarket  which is supposed to house 233 stalls,  but\r\n\r\nonly  125  stalls were taken up. And then  we  have\r\n\r\nanother  outstanding example of  a  market  at  the\r\n\r\njunction  of  Clementi Road and Pasir Panjang  Road\r\n\r\nbuilt  for  49  stalls which have  been  empty  for\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with many markets having empty stalls, thus\r\n\r\ncausing  loss of revenue to the State,  yet  almost\r\n\r\nall  approaches to markets, whether  Government  or\r\n\r\nprivate,   are   crowded   with   hawkers    mainly\r\n\r\nunlicensed.  These at the same time  block  up  the\r\n\r\nroads  which  are meant for traffic,  thus  causing\r\n\r\nserious  congestion  all round for  pedestrians  as\r\n\r\nwell   as   for  motor  traffic,  whether  carrying\r\n\r\npassengers or goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, the question of hawkers\r\n\r\nis   inter-related  with  the  problem  of   public\r\n\r\ncleansing.  Hawker  congregations  and   those   in\r\n\r\nmarkets are responsible for considerable amounts of\r\n\r\nperishable  refuse. Most hawker  congregations  are\r\n\r\nalso  made up of unauthorised structures which,  in\r\n\r\nturn,  prevent  our  cleansing workers  from  doing\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs properly, thus adding up the  piles  of\r\n\r\nrefuse.  These  in  turn  increase  public   health\r\n\r\nhazards,   for  they  bring  in  more   flies   and\r\n\r\nmosquitoes, because drains are blocked with  refuse\r\n\r\nwhich cannot he cleared and flushed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member for Mountbatten\r\n\r\nthat initial steps of re-organisation, not only  of\r\n\r\nthe Hawkers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment   but  also  of  the  Public   Cleansing\r\n\r\nDepartment,  have  been taken,  and  that  stronger\r\n\r\nremedial  measures will be taken early  next  year,\r\n\r\ni.e. after  the  forthcoming festive  seasons  are\r\n\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer the hon. Member to a part\r\n\r\nof  His  Excellency's Address which was  delivered\r\n\r\non   the   8th  December,  particularly  col.   25 [Hansard],  the  last  but  one  paragraph,  which\r\n\r\nreads as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The re-organisation and expansion of the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Health Services, Public  Cleansing,\r\n\r\nAnti-Mosquito Services and Hawkers Department  are\r\n\r\nbeing  taken  in  hand  and initial  measures  for\r\n\r\nimprovement  of transport, equipment,  enforcement\r\n\r\nof  discipline  and training of  supervisors  have\r\n\r\ncommenced.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should now like to indicate briefly what has\r\n\r\nbeen  done  and will be done soon. Firstly,  a  new\r\n\r\nHawkers' Code has been drawn up with the assistance\r\n\r\nof  the  Public  Health Advisory  Board  which  was\r\n\r\nappointed  by me in June 1964. I propose,  Sir,  to\r\n\r\nannounce   officially  the  details  of  this   new\r\n\r\nHawkers'  Code in mid-February next year,  that  is\r\n\r\nabout  one  and a half months from now,  after  the\r\n\r\nfestive  seasons are over. Secondly, for  the  five\r\n\r\nmonths  July  to  November this year,  about  1,000\r\n\r\nhawkers  in 17 congregations throughout the  island\r\n\r\nhave  been successfully resited in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe main principles outlined under the new Hawkers'\r\n\r\nCode.  And thirdly, the first step to be taken  for\r\n\r\nproper  and  effective control and  supervision  of\r\n\r\nhawkers  is  the  licensing  of  all  hawkers.   At\r\n\r\npresent,  unfortunately, only  10,000  hawkers  are\r\n\r\nlicensed out of an estimated total of anything from\r\n\r\n40,000  to  50,000 hawkers. This is, therefore,  an\r\n\r\nimpossible situation which has gone on for far  too\r\n\r\nlong  and  should be stopped accordingly. So  after\r\n\r\nthe  announcement of the new Hawkers'  Code  around\r\n\r\nmid-February 1966, it is proposed that the  Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment  will begin to license  all  hawkers  as\r\n\r\nfrom  the  1st of March, 1966. And it  is  expected\r\n\r\nthat  it  may  take a few months to cope  with  the\r\n\r\nwork. Hawkers' licences will, of course, be limited\r\n\r\nfor  issuance  to  Singapore  citizens.  And  after\r\n\r\nlicensing  all the hawkers, it will then become  an\r\n\r\noffence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  anyone  to hawk without a licence. Thereafter,\r\n\r\nthe  other provisions of the new Hawkers' Code will\r\n\r\nbe implemented step by step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to mention the fact that\r\n\r\nwhen  I  used  the term \"hawkers\",  it  should,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  include  the term \"market  stall-holders\",\r\n\r\nbecause  I  group them all under one terminology - hawkers.  In fact, the department previously  known\r\n\r\nas the Markets and Hawkers Department, a term which\r\n\r\nwas  used by my hon, friend, should really read  as\r\n\r\nthe  Hawkers and Markets Department, which  name  I\r\n\r\nchanged at least one year ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I can see\r\n\r\nhere,  $122,526  was  spent  in  building  hawkers'\r\n\r\npitches  in the following area: Tanjong Rhu Estate,\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Hill  Estate,  Kallang  Airport  Estate,\r\n\r\nBukit  Ho Swee Estate. According to the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor  Mountbatten, some of the hawkers' pitches have\r\n\r\nnot  been used. If there is any plan in the Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment to provide pitches in the rural area  so\r\n\r\nas  to  counter the unauthorised stalls which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  erected  all  over the rural  area,  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest, if possible, that these pitches be erected\r\n\r\nin a quite compact area so as to assist the hawkers\r\n\r\nin  the  rural area too. I shall be obliged if  the\r\n\r\nMinister will enlighten me on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I hope my friend the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor  Changi could be patient enough to wait for the\r\n\r\nofficial  announcement regarding the  new  Hawkers'\r\n\r\nCode,  rather than for me to say something now  and\r\n\r\nthen  come out later in drips and drops. I hope  he\r\n\r\ncould  just  hold his horses for  one  and  a  half\r\n\r\nmonths. In fact, he is already in the know, because\r\n\r\nI  have  circularised the draft Hawkers'  Code  for\r\n\r\ncomments from Government Assemblymen and it is only\r\n\r\nafter   I  have  received  all  the  comments   and\r\n\r\ncriticisms -  I have also asked for the views  of\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Health Advisory Board  -  that  I  can\r\n\r\nlaunch  out  on  this project.  It  is  really  the\r\n\r\nconcentrated  experience  not  only  of   our   own\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  but  also  of  officials  in   various\r\n\r\nMinistries covering Health, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Works Department, Roads, and Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board and so on. Because the hawker problem\r\n\r\nis not a problem by itself.  It is a social problem.. It\r\n\r\ncovers various aspects of life.  So we try to get as many\r\n\r\nheads together as possible on this problem. At last we\r\n\r\nhave formulated a code, not of too many rules and\r\n\r\nregulations, but a few general principles, such as we\r\n\r\naccept that hawking is a way of life in Singapore, but\r\n\r\nthat in their attempt to find a simple way of earning a\r\n\r\nliving, because of the very serious unemployment\r\n\r\nsituation in Singapore, the hawkers should not, on the\r\n\r\nother hand, ignore their social responsibilities as to\r\n\r\nbecome a danger both in respect of public health and also\r\n\r\nof traffic.  They have got to play according to a few\r\n\r\nrules, and they would then be assured of security in the\r\n\r\nchoice of their livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, whether the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment deliberately sold sub-standard flats to the\r\n\r\npolice or whatever it is, accommodation for members of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolice force should be of good standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, relating to old police quarters. The police\r\n\r\nquarters at Woodlands can be seen by our neighbours from\r\n\r\nacross the Causeway.  We have been boasting about our\r\n\r\nachievements such as multi-storeyed flats at Toa Payoh,\r\n\r\nsatellite towns, and so on.  But  I fear that U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nmembers, both in our country and in our neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountry, can see these old buildings at Woodlands, made\r\n\r\nof timber and occupied by members of  the Police Force,\r\n\r\nare in a dilapidated condition.  We must give serious\r\n\r\nconsideration to that.  Also, the police quarters at\r\n\r\nGeylang which are in the city area and those at Keppel\r\n\r\nHarbour.  On the left-hand side of the police quarters at\r\n\r\nKeppel Harbour, there are existing police quarters built\r\n\r\nby the Port of Singapore Authority. This is a big multi-\r\n\r\nstoreyed building in contrast to the old existing police\r\n\r\nquarters made of timber at Keppel Harbour. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, these old dilapidated police quarters have only one\r\n\r\nhall and there is not much room, with the result that the\r\n\r\nmembers of the police force with large families find it\r\n\r\ndifficult to accomodate themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, regarding the quarters at Onraet Road. These\r\n\r\nquarters at Onraet Road are for members of the rank and\r\n\r\nfile of the Police Force.  When they are promoted to the\r\n\r\nrank of Inspector, they still continue to occupy these\r\n\r\nquarters.  I feel that those who have been promoted\r\n\r\nshould vacate them, thereby giving an opportunity for the\r\n\r\nother members of the rank and file to occupy them\r\n\r\ninstead.  And for those officers who have been promoted,\r\n\r\nthere should be built special quarters for them\r\n\r\ncommensurate with their ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the\r\n\r\npolice quarters at Kampong Arang, these are, in fact, not\r\n\r\npolice quarters.  It is a block of flats leased by the\r\n\r\npolice department as a block and given out to the police\r\n\r\nfor occupation.  So if the occupants of these flats have\r\n\r\nany complaints of defects or damages, they should refer\r\n\r\nor report it to their officers, or they can even write\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndirect to the Housing and Development Board, because the\r\n\r\nBoard is responsible for the maintenance of these flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the old barracks in Woodlands, Geylang,\r\n\r\nKeppel Harbour and other places, they have been built\r\n\r\nsince prewar and no improvements can be made to them\r\n\r\nbecause the structure is such that it would cost too much\r\n\r\nto carry out the improvements.  But on this matter,\r\n\r\nprobably when new police stations are constructed with\r\n\r\nquarters attached to the police stations.  I think these\r\n\r\nquarters will be better than the ones I have mentioned\r\n\r\nhere.  I believe that the Department is aware of the fact\r\n\r\nthat Inspectors who have risen from the rank and file are\r\n\r\nstill occupying these quarters and, of course,\r\n\r\nappropriate remedial measures will be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.
