S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, arising out of that\r\n\r\nquestion,  the  delegation from  Singapore  suggested\r\n\r\nthat  there should be a Defence and Security  Council\r\n\r\nwhich should consist of seven members. They would  be\r\n\r\none  representative  of  the  United  Kingdom,  three\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the  Armed  Forces,  the   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  of Singapore, and two other representatives\r\n\r\nof the Government of Singapore. However, for purposes\r\n\r\nof  bargaining, the numbers were made equal, that is,\r\n\r\nthree from the Government of Singapore and three from\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the above, the delegation agreed to\r\n\r\nallow  the  United  Kingdom  to  have  the  power  of\r\n\r\nsuspending the constitution should internal  security\r\n\r\ndeteriorate  to  such  an extent  as  to  affect  the\r\n\r\nefficacy of external defence or should the Government\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  act  ultra vires the  constitution  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now compare this with what was agreed between\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom Government and Singapore  before\r\n\r\nthe talks broke down. We have read in the papers that\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom  agreed to  allow  Singapore  to\r\n\r\ndouble its elected Members - from the present 25 to 50.\r\n\r\nThey  further agreed to withdraw from the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  all Nominated Members as well  as  Official\r\n\r\nMinisters. On the question of citizenship, the United\r\n\r\nKingdom considered the request from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore   most  sympathetically  and  offered   the\r\n\r\ncreation of the State of Singapore with citizens  who\r\n\r\nwould  enjoy rights similar to that of fully self-governing members of the Commonwealth. Malayanisation\r\n\r\nof the civil service, in accordance with the Majority\r\n\r\nReport,   was  accepted  in  principle  and   details\r\n\r\nconcerning  this  were  left in  the  hands  of  sub-committees which never met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The points which were not fully agreed upon were\r\n\r\nthe  composition of the Defence and Security  Council\r\n\r\nand  the  powers  of  legislation  by  Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment regarding external defence. Here you  will\r\n\r\nsee  that  the bargaining point which the  delegation\r\n\r\nhad  in  mind  was  turned  into  a  firm  stand.   A\r\n\r\nsuggestion by the Chief Minister that the Chairman of\r\n\r\nthis  Council  should  be  appointed  by  the  United\r\n\r\nNations  Organisation  was  not  acceptable  to   Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government. Another suggestion made by  the\r\n\r\nPAP  that  the Chairman should be appointed  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   of   India  was  not  adopted   by   the\r\n\r\ndelegation.  A  further suggestion was  made  by  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front that the Chairman should be appointed by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  of the Federation of Malaya.  Having\r\n\r\nregard  to the fact that the two previous suggestions\r\n\r\ndid  not  meet  with success on the ground  that  the\r\n\r\nintervention of a third party in a problem  involving\r\n\r\njoint  control by the two governments  could  not  be\r\n\r\npushed  through,  we took the view  that  this  third\r\n\r\nsuggestion  would  only be turned  down  and  thereby\r\n\r\ncause  further  deadlock in the talks.  We  therefore\r\n\r\nsuggested  that,  as  the  problem  was  one   facing\r\n\r\nSingapore and Britain, it would be easier to  find  a\r\n\r\nsolution acceptable to both parties if they could, by\r\n\r\nagreement, nominate a person acceptable to  both.  We\r\n\r\nwere  proved right when the talks broke down on  this\r\n\r\npoint.  In  passing,  I must mention  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nalthough our suggestion was turned down, we stood  by\r\n\r\nthe  whole  delegation  as a  solid  front  when  the\r\n\r\nquestion  was discussed with the Secretary  of  State\r\n\r\nfor  the Colonies. We did not prejudice the case  put\r\n\r\nup by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  even  though we  had  expressed  our\r\n\r\nfeelings  at delegation meetings that the chances  of\r\n\r\nreaching  agreement with the United Kingdom  on  this\r\n\r\npoint would be slim. Our attitude has been twisted by\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. into an anti-Federation stand  and  later\r\n\r\ninto  an anti-Malay stand. This malicious fabrication\r\n\r\non  the  part  of  the P.A.P. has been  done  without\r\n\r\nregard to the evil consequences which can ensue  from\r\n\r\ncommunal ill-feelings. The public should know how the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  in  order  to  obtain  political  gain,  was\r\n\r\nprepared  to sacrifice the harmony of the people  and\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of  the  country.  Sowing  seeds   of\r\n\r\ncommunal  ill-feelings is a tactic of the Communists,\r\n\r\nand I call upon the people to open their eyes and  be\r\n\r\nwarned against these poison mongers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the talks have failed, we can realise the\r\n\r\nsetback  on the constitutional progress of Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  will  not  be possible for us to have  the  great\r\n\r\nconstitutional advance which would have been ours  by\r\n\r\nnext   year.  The  Rendel  Constitution,  which   was\r\n\r\nfiercely  criticised, is still in  force.  The  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister put it in London after the talks failed that\r\n\r\nonly  lepers  would  want to stand  for  election.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  what  he  will think of the  present  Members\r\n\r\nsitting in this House. The offer that was made by the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom was described as a Christmas  pudding\r\n\r\nwith  arsenic sauce. If that were the case, then  the\r\n\r\npresent constitution would be an arsenic cake. It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  very interesting to find that  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  has decided to eat this arsenic cake, although\r\n\r\na few days ago a Christmas pudding with arsenic sauce\r\n\r\nwas totally unacceptable!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it from all angles, I feel that the\r\n\r\nbreakdown  of the talks was not at all  done  with  a\r\n\r\nsense of realism. In fact, if we compare what we  set\r\n\r\nout  to get with what was actually agreed between the\r\n\r\ndelegation and the United Kingdom, we will find  that\r\n\r\nwe obtained practically all that we had asked for. In\r\n\r\nfact, even the P.A.P. leader, who stated publicly  that\r\n\r\nhe  had gone to London to fight for only 75 per  cent\r\n\r\nMerdeka,  was  ready to accept it.  On  the  question\r\n\r\nwhether Britain should have the power to suspend  the\r\n\r\nconstitution  partially as well as totally,  he  even\r\n\r\ntried to persuade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister that if he was willing to give the\r\n\r\npower  of total suspension to Britain, then logically\r\n\r\nand  legally  Britain could use part  of  the  powers\r\n\r\ngiven  her.  However, we were told  of  a  mysterious\r\n\r\ncable,  and then the stand of the P.A.P. became  that\r\n\r\nof  a  full  loaf  or  none at all.  This  change  of\r\n\r\nattitude on the part of the P.A.P. leader closed  all\r\n\r\navenues  of  retreat to the Chief Minister  from  the\r\n\r\nstand taken by him. This, in fact, was the true cause\r\n\r\nof  the failure. Viewing the events in retrospect,  I\r\n\r\nfirmly  believe  that the Chief Minister  would  have\r\n\r\nagreed to the proposals by the United Kingdom if only\r\n\r\nhe had thought things over before acting. The frantic\r\n\r\nbid  by the Chief Minister to reopen the talks on his\r\n\r\nown  personal  responsibility was ample  evidence  of\r\n\r\nthis. Singapore spent a large sum of money - in fact, $\r\n\r\n180,000 - on    this   abortive   trip.   Stooges    of\r\n\r\ninternational Communism will, I am sure, welcome  the\r\n\r\nfailure  so that they can still put up the appearance\r\n\r\nof  fighting colonialism. We, the Liberal-Socialists,\r\n\r\nare  of the opinion that we should have accepted  the\r\n\r\nUnited    Kingdom   proposals   and   then   continue\r\n\r\nnegotiating  to  further  limit  the  powers  of  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's  Government on the question of  legislation\r\n\r\nwith  regard to external defence. It would have  been\r\n\r\neasier  for us to come back with 90 per cent Merdeka,\r\n\r\nwork  it,  and after some time, go back and  ask  for\r\n\r\njust  one or two more concessions to attain  the  100\r\n\r\nper  cent  independence. By that time, we would  have\r\n\r\nraised  our  own forces for our own defence  and  the\r\n\r\nproblem of external defence would then be more easily\r\n\r\nsolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider the policy of the P.A.P., as the Hon.\r\n\r\nMr Francis Thomas once said, that of a young man  in\r\n\r\na  great hurry. He wants to drive a car at 100  miles\r\n\r\nper   hour  through  the  streets  of  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nregardless  of  the  number of  people  he  may  have\r\n\r\nkilled.   No  doubt  such  a  speed  will   be   most\r\n\r\nspectacular and will hit the headlines - but  who  will\r\n\r\nbe the sufferers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Liberal-Socialists are concerned, we\r\n\r\nadhere  to  our  stand.  We view  the  problem  in  a\r\n\r\npractical  manner. What we promised we  have  carried\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe   declared  that  we  would  fight  for  a  common\r\n\r\ncitizenship  for  Singapore. We  did  it.  We  stated\r\n\r\npublicly  that we wanted to safeguard the freedom  of\r\n\r\nthe  individual  and the freedom  of  the  Press.  We\r\n\r\nwanted to be sure that when Merdeka comes, the safety\r\n\r\nof the people individually, whether they are young or\r\n\r\nold,  whether they are of one race or another, should\r\n\r\nbe  safeguarded.  We voiced that for  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  All  Parties declared at  the  conference\r\n\r\nthat  they  were  aware  of the  danger  of  internal\r\n\r\nsubversion;  yet  some were prepared,  and,  in  fact,\r\n\r\npreferred to gamble on it. We fully realise, however,\r\n\r\nthat   Singapore   is  a  commercial   centre   whose\r\n\r\nprosperity  depends  upon  trade,  which   can   only\r\n\r\nflourish  under  stable conditions  and  feelings  of\r\n\r\nsecurity.  Whereas the other Parties  voted  for  the\r\n\r\nbreakdown  of  the talks, the Liberal-Socialists  and\r\n\r\nthe M.C.A. did not favour it -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. J.

The  subsequent  correspondence\r\n\r\nbetween the Chief Minister and the Secretary of State\r\n\r\nembodied in the White Paper, which is the subject  of\r\n\r\nthe  next motion, seeking to reopen the talks, proved\r\n\r\nour  point.  In  fact, these letters written  by  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister provide all the justification that  is\r\n\r\nneeded for my amendment to the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in rising\r\n\r\nto  second the amendment, I speak as one who was,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  not a member of the delegation but was  able\r\n\r\nto follow events perhaps from a more objective angle,\r\n\r\nor  at least from a Singapore angle. First of all, it\r\n\r\nis  as  well to recall some of the things which  were\r\n\r\nsaid and done immediately prior to the opening of the\r\n\r\nLondon  talks.  For example, may I remind  the  House\r\n\r\nwhat the Hon. the Chief Secretary reported to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  in  connection with the  Kallang  mass\r\n\r\nrally, as memories are sometimes short:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At about 6.40 p.m. the chanting became more excited\r\n\r\nand  a  number of youths were seen working  up  their\r\n\r\ncompanions, lobbing pieces of wood, poles and banners\r\n\r\nat the police who remained steady at their posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police had been apprehensive of disorder because\r\n\r\nof  slighting  references  made  to  the  police   at\r\n\r\nseveral  P.A.P. meetings and because of the  campaign\r\n\r\nin  the  Press by a large group of so-called  Chinese\r\n\r\ncultural   associations  and  students   during   the\r\n\r\nprevious two weeks protesting against police refusals\r\n\r\nto  issue  licences for the performance of songs  and\r\n\r\ndances of Communist meaning. These organisations held\r\n\r\na  further  protest  meeting at  the  Badminton  Hall\r\n\r\nimmediately  prior to the mass rally.  After  it,  at\r\n\r\nabout  4  p.m., some 4,000 to 5,000 youths from  that\r\n\r\nmeeting marched in an orderly and disciplined  manner\r\n\r\nto  the  rally. They carried a large banner depicting\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  dove of peace. When they  encountered\r\n\r\npolice officers on duty, there was organised shouting\r\n\r\nof  Merdeka.  Their attitude was one of contempt  for\r\n\r\nthe police...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine days later the Hon. the Chief Minister, in a\r\n\r\nbroadcast before leaving for London, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Britain wants Singapore as a prosperous free port\r\n\r\nserving  the  commerce  of the  world.  This  is  the\r\n\r\ndestiny we seek. Britain wants to keep Singapore free\r\n\r\nfrom  the deadly clutches of Communism. We know  that\r\n\r\nCommunism in this mercantile island means death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four days later, on, I think, the 16th of April, my\r\n\r\nhon. Friend's first act in London was to address \"the\r\n\r\nblunt truth\", as he called it, to Malayan students in\r\n\r\na  supposedly hush-hush talk. He stated, or so it  is\r\n\r\nreported, that 1959 was the date for the take-over in\r\n\r\nSingapore  by a camouflaged Communist party,  and  he\r\n\r\nhad warned the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan\r\n\r\nYew) that the latter was inviting Communists into the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  On the following day he admitted in  a  Press\r\n\r\nrelease:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The main theme of my address was the dangerous\r\n\r\nattitude  of  a group in Singapore that  is  not  big\r\n\r\nenough  to overcome their bitterness against colonial\r\n\r\nrule  and talks of throwing the White man out of  the\r\n\r\ncolony.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 22nd of April, on the very eve of the talks,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  took  his  turn  in\r\n\r\naddressing the students, stating:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Our first task is to get rid of the white man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe  was quoted as explaining that \"the chance of  one\r\n\r\nof  his English-educated audience becoming the future\r\n\r\nprime minister of Malaya was 'extremely slender'.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the Members of this House were away\r\n\r\nin  London,  but I can tell them now that the  effect\r\n\r\nwhich  these statements by the P.A.P. leader  and  by\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister had on the people of this island,\r\n\r\nalready  deeply shaken by the Kallang  rally  fiasco,\r\n\r\nwas  one  of considerable concern, coupled  with  the\r\n\r\ngrowing  conviction that the maintenance of full  and\r\n\r\nfirm  internal security transcended almost all  other\r\n\r\nconsiderations. Could there, therefore, be the  least\r\n\r\nsurprise, either in London or in Singapore, that  the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of  State should state that Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment  would undertake to see that this  country\r\n\r\ndid  not  become an outpost of Communism and was  not\r\n\r\nthis  the  logical reply to the Chief Minister's  own\r\n\r\nfears?  If this were not so, why should the  citizens\r\n\r\nof  this country not have risen up in their wrath  on\r\n\r\nthe  breakdown of the talks? What has happened to the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Chief Minister's 167,000 signatories,  who\r\n\r\nare  supposed  to  have wanted his brand  of  all-or-nothing  Merdeka  and  who, by  their  silence,  have\r\n\r\nrevealed  that  they do not desire  anything  of  the\r\n\r\nsort?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You are wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\ncomplained   yesterday  that  British   opinion   had\r\n\r\nhardened on the arrival of the delegation in  London.\r\n\r\nThe  extremism of his own Party no doubt  contributed\r\n\r\nto  this  hardening just as it had contributed  to  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  hardening  of opinion in Singapore,  namely,\r\n\r\ntowards  the view that the internal security of  this\r\n\r\ncountry must be properly safeguarded. Should it  not,\r\n\r\ntherefore, have become clearer, as the days went  by,\r\n\r\nthat if Her Majesty's Government's offer on all other\r\n\r\nmajor  issues  was acceptable, we should  accept  the\r\n\r\nwhole,  and  was not that, in fact, the view  of  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member himself for at least the first  half  of\r\n\r\nthe  talks?  The  Hon. the Chief Minister  complained\r\n\r\nyesterday  that  the final differences  in  viewpoint\r\n\r\nbetween the Colonial Office and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndelegation were so small that the former should  have\r\n\r\ngiven  in  to  his  demands, but is  it  not  equally\r\n\r\narguable that he should have made concessions when so\r\n\r\nmuch  had  already been gained? Is it not nearer  the\r\n\r\ntruth that the Chief Minister over-reached himself in\r\n\r\nthe  terms  he  tried  to wrest  from  Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  is  this  not  borne  out  by   his\r\n\r\nsubsequent actions after the breakdown of the  talks?\r\n\r\nThe  truth is that almost everybody knows, including,\r\n\r\nI  sometimes  think,  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself,  that  the British offer in its  final  form\r\n\r\nshould have been accepted as an interim measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nanyang Siang Pau of the 15th of May, I think it\r\n\r\nwas,  pointed  out  that \"members of  the  delegation\r\n\r\nshould have room for mutual toleration and concession\r\n\r\nand  never allow a deadlock, as success could not  be\r\n\r\nachieved  all  at  once; and  further,  that  if  the\r\n\r\ndelegates  returned  with powers  of  internal  self-government,   other  difficult  problems   could   be\r\n\r\nreserved for decision later and there was no need  to\r\n\r\nforce  the  issue now.\" That was the true feeling  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Those  were  the  views  of  the  village\r\n\r\nleaders,  both Chinese and Malay, in the rural  areas\r\n\r\nof  my constituency whom I visited when the breakdown\r\n\r\noccurred.  Indeed,  many to whom I  spoke  went  even\r\n\r\nfurther.  They  said that if the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar really wished to throw out the white man, there\r\n\r\nwould  be  no  Service  establishments  and  no   big\r\n\r\ncommercial houses, and consequently no jobs  for  the\r\n\r\nconsiderable  number  of workers  employed  by  these\r\n\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 15th of April, a week before this expression\r\n\r\nof  extremism, the view of the hon. Member  had  been\r\n\r\nmore  moderate  when  he  said  on  the  eve  of  his\r\n\r\ndeparture  for London that the object of the  Merdeka\r\n\r\nMission  was not to secure full independence  but  75\r\n\r\nper   cent   self-government  with   complete   self-government after five years. On the 15th  of  May,  a\r\n\r\nmonth  later, the P.A.P. was to reject the very large\r\n\r\nmeasure of self-government offered and to threaten to\r\n\r\nbring   Singapore  to  an  economic   and   political\r\n\r\nstandstill, thus showing cynicism and an  utter  lack\r\n\r\nof principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a fully-elected Legislative Assembly; with our\r\n\r\nown  Home  Minister and Finance Minister having  full\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the  police  and  the  revenues  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry;  with the details of Malayanisation  settled\r\n\r\nand  their  implementation well on the  way;  with  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizenship established and  an  electoral\r\n\r\nroll  fully representative of the people; can it  not\r\n\r\nbe  seen that the complete self-government after five\r\n\r\nyears which the P.A.P. claimed they wanted would,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  have been inevitable and very much more  of  a\r\n\r\nreality  in even less time? Indeed, the Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState promised a review of the working of the Defence\r\n\r\nand Security Council after two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, the greatest disservice which the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister, as leader of the delegation, has\r\n\r\ndone  to  this country is not merely to have rejected\r\n\r\nthis considerable constitutional advance but also  to\r\n\r\nhave  kept the one and a quarter million citizens  of\r\n\r\nthis island in continued doubt and anxiety as to  the\r\n\r\nnext  turn  of  events. For far  too  long  have  all\r\n\r\nsections  of the community been saying to  themselves\r\n\r\nand  to  each  other, \"What is going to happen?\"  The\r\n\r\nfeeling  of uncertainty, of insecurity and of malaise\r\n\r\nhas  haunted  Singapore for far longer  than  we  can\r\n\r\npossibly  afford. This country is not merely standing\r\n\r\nstill,  it is sliding backwards. The Chief Minister's\r\n\r\npolicy, most unfortunately, has seen to it that  this\r\n\r\nposition  of  uncertainty is  to  continue  for  some\r\n\r\nmonths to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister told the Malayan\r\n\r\nstudents in London:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore's economy is so delicately balanced that\r\n\r\nwe  survive  only  by  virtue of  the  activities  of\r\n\r\ncapital.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>His  all-or-nothing  policy has  considerably  shaken\r\n\r\nthat  balance.  His action in accusing  the  Colonial\r\n\r\nSecretary of Fascism one day and writing to  him  the\r\n\r\nnext  and pleading for the reopening of the talks  in\r\n\r\nthose  words - \"permit me to express my admiration  for\r\n\r\nyour  very  real  abilities\" - was  hardly  a  balanced\r\n\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not only be honest, Sir, with ourselves in\r\n\r\nthis  House  but with the people of this  country  as\r\n\r\nwell, and let\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nus  match our own common sense with the sturdy common\r\n\r\nsense  of  the majority of Singapore's citizens.  And\r\n\r\nwhat our joint common sense tells us is this: that 90\r\n\r\nper  cent internal self-government plus 100 per  cent\r\n\r\nsecurity  with  which  to maintain  it  is  a  better\r\n\r\nproposition  today than 100 per cent  internal  self-government plus only 50 per cent security with  which\r\n\r\nto  maintain it. If the Member for Bukit  Timah  (Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Ching Siong) cares to call me a colonial  stooge\r\n\r\nfor  stating that proposition, then all I can say  is\r\n\r\nthat  the bulk of Singapore's population are  stooges\r\n\r\nalong  with  me, if they were given the chance,  free\r\n\r\nfrom   the  fear  of  the  sinister  propaganda   and\r\n\r\nintimidation which the P.A.P. indulges in, to express\r\n\r\ntheir true feelings and convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister knows very well that\r\n\r\nthe  Liberal-Socialist delegates urged him up to  the\r\n\r\nlast  moment to accept what had been offered and then\r\n\r\nto go back later for more. He cannot, in any honesty,\r\n\r\nblame them for his own lack of vision, nor indeed has\r\n\r\nhe  done  so.  The people of Singapore are  sick  and\r\n\r\ntired  of  crises and this amendment  reflects  their\r\n\r\nreal   feelings  regarding  the  totally  unnecessary\r\n\r\nfailure  of  a  mission. That is  the  truth  of  the\r\n\r\nmatter, and the tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That the words proposed to be\r\n\r\nleft out, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am  obliged  to  the Hon. the Chief  Minister  for\r\n\r\nallowing  me  to  speak first on this amendment.  For\r\n\r\npersonal reasons, I will not be able to stay in  this\r\n\r\nHouse beyond 11 o'clock and I was afraid I would have\r\n\r\nto  leave this Assembly without having answered  some\r\n\r\nof  the charges made against me by the leader of  the\r\n\r\nmajority  Opposition Party, the Member for  Serangoon\r\n\r\n(Mr Lim Choon Mong), and the Member for Tanglin (Mr\r\n\r\nEde).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the People's Action Party, when we left\r\n\r\nSingapore, issued an official statement - 75  per  cent\r\n\r\nMerdeka. Unlike the Liberal-Socialist Party, when  we\r\n\r\nissue an official statement, we mean what we say.  We\r\n\r\nprepared the ground for an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagreement  with the Colonial Office on the  basis  of\r\n\r\ncomplete  internal self-government in order  that  we\r\n\r\ncould never be accused either by our supporters or by\r\n\r\nour  enemies  of  cheating. We fought strenuously  in\r\n\r\nLondon  to achieve this. Whatever differences  I  had\r\n\r\nwith  the Chief Minister were because I tried to keep\r\n\r\nthe basis of discussion on the heads of agreement  we\r\n\r\nhad   agreed  upon  before  we  left  Singapore.  Our\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of the agreement we  had  arrived  at\r\n\r\nbefore we left Singapore was complete internal  self-government. We wanted self-government. We  gave  away\r\n\r\nexternal  affairs and external defence, and  we  were\r\n\r\nleft with internal self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon said he urged upon the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister the illogicality of the stand of  the\r\n\r\ndelegation  and  of the P.A.P. in refusing  to  offer\r\n\r\npartial  suspension of the constitution when we  had,\r\n\r\nin   fact,  offered  the  whole.  That,  Sir,  is   a\r\n\r\ncompletely malicious misrepresentation of the  facts.\r\n\r\nHe knew exactly what our stand was. We went to London\r\n\r\non  this  basis.  We did not give away  anything.  We\r\n\r\nwanted  to  ask  only  for  complete  internal  self-government  because  we  could  not  have  got  more,\r\n\r\nbecause other members of the delegation, the Liberal-Socialists, would not have agreed. Having  asked  for\r\n\r\ninternal  self-government, it  was  idle  to  discuss\r\n\r\nwhether or not Her Majesty's Government had the right\r\n\r\nto  suspend  the  constitution.  There  is  only  one\r\n\r\nsovereign power in any territory, and as long  as  we\r\n\r\nare not independent, that sovereign power is Britain.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  are independent like Ceylon, then  the  old\r\n\r\nimperial power is out. When the Ceylonese decided  to\r\n\r\noust  the  British bases, there was  no  question  of\r\n\r\nsuspending  the  constitution  because  to   re-enter\r\n\r\nCeylon  was an act of aggression. But until  we  have\r\n\r\nattained independence, Britain is the sovereign power\r\n\r\nand we have to accept that position. I agree that  if\r\n\r\nBritain  has  the power to suspend the whole  of  the\r\n\r\nconstitution, then, a fortiori, she has the power  to\r\n\r\nsuspend  part  of it. But that is entirely  different\r\n\r\nfrom  saying that I agree to the British  having  the\r\n\r\npower\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  suspend any part of the constitution. There is  a\r\n\r\nfundamental difference in political approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for three weeks in London I argued and I\r\n\r\nargued  for a settlement. No one in this House  knows\r\n\r\nbetter  how absolutely vital it was for us to have  a\r\n\r\nsettlement  if it was possible, but I  found  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  week  that it was not possible.  I  found  that\r\n\r\nBritain had decided that she was not going to give us\r\n\r\ncomplete  internal self-government, that Britain  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  sit  in  with the learner-driver.  Britain\r\n\r\nwanted  an  Austin  car with dual  controls.  Britain\r\n\r\nwanted  to  be next to the driver. What  we  said  to\r\n\r\nBritain  was, \"If you want me to agree  to  have  you\r\n\r\nsitting  in with me, I want one set of controls.  The\r\n\r\nday you take over, I will ostentatiously get out from\r\n\r\nthe  driving seat and you can be in supreme  control.\r\n\r\nBut I refuse to be your stooge, to be your pawn, like\r\n\r\nthe Liberal-Socialists would have been.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Not at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

We\r\n\r\nare all prisoners of our own past, of our upbringing;\r\n\r\nour  mental  attitudes are values that we learned  as\r\n\r\nlittle  children.

Nehru said that when  a  colonial  power\r\n\r\nsucceeds in making a man think he is a slave, and  he\r\n\r\nthinks like a slave, then the threat of power  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger necessary, and the supreme achievement  of  an\r\n\r\nimperial power in subjugation is achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand the Hon. Mr Sutherland and the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin,  but I  find  it  difficult  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the Member for Serangoon. In fact,  a  lot\r\n\r\nof  Malayan  students  found  it  very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nunderstand him. He went to one meeting and said,  \"We\r\n\r\nare  Liberal-Socialists. Because we believe that  the\r\n\r\nworld should be a little bit freer, therefore we  are\r\n\r\nLiberals.  Because we believe that  employers  should\r\n\r\ngive a little bit more to their workers, therefore we\r\n\r\nare  Socialists.  Therefore  we  call  ourselves  the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialists.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they appeared before the Malayan students in\r\n\r\nLondon  one  Sunday  and they never  appeared  again,\r\n\r\nalthough they were invited, because they accused  the\r\n\r\nstudents of hooliganism. The students there  are  all\r\n\r\nidealistic;  they asked the Liberal-Socialist  leader\r\n\r\nwhether he was prepared to fight and die for freedom,\r\n\r\nwhether  be  was prepared to go to jail if necessary.\r\n\r\nHe  replied, \"Do not be silly. All these  things  are\r\n\r\nunnecessary.  Why  should we go  to  jail  for  these\r\n\r\nthings? The British are bound to give us these things\r\n\r\nand  all  that we have got to do is to wait  for  the\r\n\r\nhand-over.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know what to make of these people.\r\n\r\nThey   say   that  this  is  their  Party  statement.\r\n\r\nTherefore I assume\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  it  has  received  careful  deliberation  as  a\r\n\r\nstatement of policy. It says the P.A.P. is afraid  of\r\n\r\nMerdeka  and the P.A.P. have done their very best  to\r\n\r\nachieve   their  aim  of  not  getting   Merdeka   by\r\n\r\nfrightening  the British. Sir, there is  a  touch  of\r\n\r\nhallucination about this whole thing which  sometimes\r\n\r\ntroubles  me in my sleep. I propose now to read  from\r\n\r\nthe   \"Suara  Merdeka\",  the  organ  of  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nstudents  in  Britain. I think they  must  have  been\r\n\r\ntroubled in their sleep too. They quote Torch,  organ\r\n\r\nof  the Liberal-Socialist Party, which contained  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  account of an inaugural  meeting  for  the\r\n\r\nformation  of a Youth Group at a seaside bungalow  at\r\n\r\nSiglap:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It was a fine gathering, healthy young people\r\n\r\nhaving a pleasant and enjoyable day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sport, games and dancing preceded and followed the\r\n\r\nmeeting   to   elect   office-bearers.   Unlike   the\r\n\r\nregimented gatherings of the young section  of  other\r\n\r\npolitical Parties, the members spent their time  more\r\n\r\non  play  than  on  business. The organisers  of  the\r\n\r\ngathering are to be congratulated for taking an  easy\r\n\r\nattitude towards politics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  from their Party organ. I quote the comment\r\n\r\nof the Malayan students in Great Britain: \"Those whom\r\n\r\nthe  gods wish to destroy, they first make mad.\"  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  any  man  who  subscribes   to   this\r\n\r\namendment  of  the Liberal-Socialists must  be  going\r\n\r\nmad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Serangoon and leader of the Liberal-Socialists in\r\n\r\nthis  House, whom I respect as a man who always  does\r\n\r\nseek  to  be honest and yet is torn between  his  own\r\n\r\npersonal  integrity  and his  loyalty  to  his  Party\r\n\r\ncaucus,   has   drawn  attention  to  some   of   the\r\n\r\ningredients  of  the constitution which  the  British\r\n\r\noffered. He and the Member for Tiong Bahru have  made\r\n\r\nsome  play  on the question of citizenship.  I  think\r\n\r\nthey are conscious of how we of the Labour Front have\r\n\r\nstruggled,  with  sincerity,  with  ardour  and  with\r\n\r\ntirelessness to get it. I do not think  we  need  say\r\n\r\nit - it  must be plain - that the question of citizenship\r\n\r\nto us is one of vital importance to Singapore, and  I\r\n\r\nneed  hardly  say that we have the people's  sympathy\r\n\r\nwith  our  domiciled  Chinese  particularly  who  are\r\n\r\ndeprived of the right of citizenship. But, Sir, I  am\r\n\r\none who respects these Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  I  am  certain that they would not ask that  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of Singapore should be sacrificed  in  order\r\n\r\nthat  they  should have citizenship. I am  sure  that\r\n\r\nthey  themselves would not want, not a  90  per  cent\r\n\r\nMerdeka,  but  a \"busok\" Merdeka in order  that  they\r\n\r\nshould be citizens of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are good ingredients in what the British\r\n\r\noffered.  May  I refer to paragraph 67 of  our  White\r\n\r\nPaper  in which we openly said so. With some sarcasm,\r\n\r\nSir,  my  description  of the constitution  has  been\r\n\r\nreferred  to - the description that it is  a  Christmas\r\n\r\ncake  with arsenic sauce. A Christmas cake  has  fine\r\n\r\ningredients,  just as there were good ingredients  in\r\n\r\nwhat  we  were offered, but the whole was a poisonous\r\n\r\npackage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 67 of the White Paper says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"On the resumption of the meeting the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nindicated   with  deep  regret  that  the   otherwise\r\n\r\nacceptable Constitutional framework proposed  by  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government was rendered unacceptable due to\r\n\r\nthe    insistence   of   the   over-riding   Imperial\r\n\r\nLegislative Powers and a majority vote on the Defence\r\n\r\nand Security Council.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So it is drawing a red herring, Sir, to refer to some\r\n\r\nof the ingredients in this offer which were good. The\r\n\r\nquestion   really  is:  Were  they   not   completely\r\n\r\nnullified  when it was the intention of Her Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment  to retain complete imperial  powers  over\r\n\r\nSingapore which would remain a colony? The Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon said we got almost everything we had  asked\r\n\r\nfor.  May  I  remind him that we asked  for  Dominion\r\n\r\nstatus?  We asked for complete political freedom.  At\r\n\r\nno  time did we agree, either here or anywhere  else,\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  should remain a colony,  subject  to\r\n\r\nthese day-to-day over-riding imperial powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remarkable thing about this amendment of the\r\n\r\nMember for Serangoon, Sir, the unhappy thing - I cannot\r\n\r\nspeak  with anger; I speak in real sorrow - is  that  I\r\n\r\nsee  a  man of integrity act in this fashion,  but  I\r\n\r\nwould   ask  this  gentleman,  who  today  moves   an\r\n\r\namendment  requesting  this  House  to  approve   the\r\n\r\nacceptance of the British proposals, how he acted  in\r\n\r\nLondon.

And I  said,\r\n\r\n\"You,  you, and you?\" \"Abstain\", came the answers.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not know what \"abstain\" means. To me it is an act\r\n\r\nof  cowardice for a representative of the  people  in\r\n\r\nany matter that is before the House or with which  he\r\n\r\nis entrusted.

How\r\n\r\ndid  these  gentlemen react when  two  days  later  I\r\n\r\nsought to reopen the talks on a far more advantageous\r\n\r\nbasis for Singapore?

I  would  like\r\n\r\nto  remind  him  and his colleague  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin,  who  seconded the amendment,  that  it  was\r\n\r\ntheir  Party  alone  who  in  this  House,  when  the\r\n\r\nquestion of self-government was first discussed, were\r\n\r\nthe ones who asked for immediate independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> The lion roars!.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The lion has roared and is still trying\r\n\r\nto  roar.  I will read now from our Hansard  of  what\r\n\r\nhappened on that occasion (Official Report,  Vol.  1,\r\n\r\nNo.  8,  dated  25th July, 1955). This  is  what  the\r\n\r\nMember for Paya Lebar said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Let us therefore play the game, (if they can) and\r\n\r\nask  for a full transfer of power so that we, and  we\r\n\r\nalone,  shall be responsible for our own affairs  and\r\n\r\ndestiny and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish  Government need no longer be answerable  for\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the principles which I have\r\n\r\nstated, I therefore move an amendment which will  not\r\n\r\nonly  be  in line with the first and second parts  of\r\n\r\nthis motion, but also remove all future occasions for\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction.

We are, of course, quite accustomed,  both  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  and outside it, to witness the  farcical\r\n\r\ngymnastic   somersaults   which   the   now   defunct\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party (absorbed by the Lion  Party)  and\r\n\r\nthe  newly-born Liberal-Socialist Party have made and\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  make. It is, of course,  understandable\r\n\r\nfor  the Member for Tanglin to second this amendment.\r\n\r\nI can also understand what he represents in more ways\r\n\r\nthan one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the delegation left for London, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin,  on  behalf of the  Liberal-Socialists,\r\n\r\nchanged  the  whole original attitude of  his  Party,\r\n\r\nwhich  had  asked  for  immediate  independence,   by\r\n\r\nseeking   certain  reservations  for  Her   Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  safeguards on the internal  security\r\n\r\nproblem,  but  the All-Party Delegation started  from\r\n\r\nSingapore  unanimous  in the  call  for  Merdeka.  In\r\n\r\nLondon,  before  the conference was  opened,  it  was\r\n\r\nagreed  by all delegates that, if any differences  of\r\n\r\nopinion  arose  in the course of discussions,  a  15-minute  adjournment be asked for, so  that  we  could\r\n\r\niron  out  any differences amongst ourselves  in  the\r\n\r\ncommittee rooms that were supplied to us, so  as  not\r\n\r\nto  disclose  any discord. Furthermore, the  Liberal-Socialist  Party  agreed  that  on  the  question  of\r\n\r\ninternal security they would voice their opinion only\r\n\r\nwhen the question arose. But in spite of this, at the\r\n\r\nopening speeches of the conference, the leader of the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialists  made  a most  puerile  statement,\r\n\r\nwhich  he no doubt had already prepared in Singapore,\r\n\r\nproclaiming  his Party's platform on the question  of\r\n\r\ninternal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecurity. The Hon. the Chief Minister kindly referred\r\n\r\nto  the speech as ill-timed or ill-chosen, but my own\r\n\r\nview  is  that  not  only was it ill-timed  and  ill-chosen, but it immediately signified to Her Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment,  before any matters could  be  discussed,\r\n\r\nthat  there  was discord amongst the members  of  the\r\n\r\ndelegation,  and  without  wishing  to   breach   any\r\n\r\nconfidence,  my view was upheld by a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialist Party - and that was not  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Changi. If the Member for Tanjong Pagar is right\r\n\r\nin  his  opinion that the people of Britain  and  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government had before our arrival  hardened\r\n\r\nagainst  the  request for Merdeka, did  this  opening\r\n\r\nspeech of the leader of the Liberal-Socialists, which\r\n\r\nclearly  intimated to Her Majesty's  Government  that\r\n\r\nhis  Party  was ready to accept any crumbs that  fell\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Colonial Office table,  not  lend  further\r\n\r\nfortification to the British attitude?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Quote what I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The Liberal-Socialists, I suppose by\r\n\r\nthis  opening speech, hoped to gain favour  with  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's  Government and to be looked  upon  as  the\r\n\r\nblue-eyed baby. The Colonial Secretary, who is a most\r\n\r\nastute  man  (as  we all know), subsequently  invited\r\n\r\nmembers  of  all Parties separately and  individually\r\n\r\neither  to lunch or some other entertainment,  where,\r\n\r\nno  doubt, he was able to assess the different  views\r\n\r\nof  the  Parties.

Yesterday  he\r\n\r\ntold us that it did not matter if we did not have the\r\n\r\ntrimmings so long as we had the substance,  that  \"it\r\n\r\ndoes  not matter if we do not have the tomatoes,  the\r\n\r\nlettuce  and  the  salad  so  long  as  we  have  the\r\n\r\nchicken.\"  Sir,  there  are times  when  the  chicken\r\n\r\nwithout  the trimmings is unpalatable, and there  are\r\n\r\ntimes  when  such a substance - if he thinks  it  is  a\r\n\r\nsubstance - would  make the body politic  sick.

Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, if we had accepted the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office's proposals, it would  have  led  to\r\n\r\ngreater  instability. Agitators would have been  able\r\n\r\nto  use  the  excuse of, \"the sword  that  is  always\r\n\r\nhanging over our heads\" to arouse passions, to commit\r\n\r\nmurder  and  arson  and to arouse racial  antagonism.\r\n\r\nThat is what we wanted to prevent and that is why  we\r\n\r\nrefused  to accept a dishonourable compromise.  Would\r\n\r\nwe  have  got  this stability? I say  we  would  not,\r\n\r\nunless  we  had  a  proper  constitution  where   our\r\n\r\nprinciples would not have been sacrificed, and  where\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore could have understood  that\r\n\r\nthey  had got \"something clean\" - in the words  of  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister. It is like a healthy person having  a\r\n\r\nthorn in his foot. That thorn acts as an irritant and\r\n\r\nthe  mere  presence of that source of  irritation  is\r\n\r\nenough to put him in an unstable frame of mind. It is\r\n\r\nbetter  to  be  sick, as we are today under  colonial\r\n\r\nrule, and fight on for independence rather than  have\r\n\r\na thorn in the flesh and feel irritable all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday we heard a series of speakers on the\r\n\r\npost-mortem of the Merdeka talks and the reasons  why\r\n\r\nthey  failed.  \"The British were in no mood  to  give\r\n\r\naway  further  concessions to the colony;  there  was\r\n\r\ndissension   among  the  delegates  themselves;   the\r\n\r\nColonial Office was adamant.\" I ask, Sir, why was the\r\n\r\nColonial Office adamant? Because they knew that there\r\n\r\nwas  one  weak  link in the chain of the  delegation,\r\n\r\nThey  knew that that one weak link was ready to  come\r\n\r\nto  any  compromise, whether honourable or not.  They\r\n\r\nknew  that that one weak link did not have  the  same\r\n\r\ndesire for independence as the others had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Refer to the Chief Minister's\r\n\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Knowing all this, Sir, do you\r\n\r\nnot  think  that  it is likely that  a  people,  well\r\n\r\nseasoned in politics like the British are, would  not\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken  advantage  at once of that weakness  of  ours?\r\n\r\nSir, that is one more major reason why the delegation\r\n\r\nfailed to obtain success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanglin stated that he was able\r\n\r\nto  follow  from  here events with a  more  objective\r\n\r\nangle, rather a Singapore angle. It is likely that he\r\n\r\nfollowed the events as presented to the public by the\r\n\r\nBritish   Press,  which  everybody   knows   is   not\r\n\r\nunbiased - to be very mild about it. Sir, he also asked\r\n\r\nwhat had happened to those 167,000 Merdeka signatures\r\n\r\nof   the  Chief  Minister - mind  you,  of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister;  they  had no share in it.  Why  were  they\r\n\r\nsilent when we did not get Merdeka? Sir, that is  the\r\n\r\ntrouble.  These gentlemen on the opposite benches - the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialists - are not in touch with the  masses.\r\n\r\nThey  do  not realise the amount of effort  that  has\r\n\r\ngone  into  keeping the lid on, to  prevent  it  from\r\n\r\nblowing  up. They do not know what has been going  on\r\n\r\nbehind the scenes, because they are not in touch with\r\n\r\nthe  masses. If they had known, if they had  been  in\r\n\r\ncontact  with  the masses, they would  have  realised\r\n\r\nthat  it  is very dangerous to touch on this subject.\r\n\r\nIf  this  is taken as a challenge, what is  going  to\r\n\r\nhappen tomorrow? Then they will be held to blame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in closing, I would like to say that yesterday\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Tanjong Pagar, in one  of  his  most\r\n\r\nbalanced  speeches - so it appeared to  me - pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  the  right path now lay towards a united,  non-Communist  national  movement.  That,  Sir,  is   the\r\n\r\nreaction of many right-minded people today after  the\r\n\r\nfailure of the talks; and the failure of the talks is\r\n\r\nalready  acting  as  an  incentive  towards  such   a\r\n\r\nmovement,  driving  to the side party  squabbles  and\r\n\r\nparty politics, except perhaps for a few un-national-minded people. With such a strong and united national\r\n\r\nmovement, Merdeka cannot be refused and I hope,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the day will not be far off when, in the  words\r\n\r\nof the Member for Changi, we will be able to sink all\r\n\r\nparty  differences  and unite in a national  movement\r\n\r\nfor  independence - and I do not expect certain Members\r\n\r\nin this House will take part in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Liberal-Socialist Party has a certain political immaturity.\r\n\r\nTo  put  it  rather more simply, they  are  sometimes\r\n\r\nrather silly.

I find it quite in  vain\r\n\r\nto  attempt  to  understand either their  motives  or\r\n\r\ntheir objectives. The only conclusion that I can come\r\n\r\nto  for  the  moving of this amendment is that  their\r\n\r\ntraditional  political  un-wisdom  has   once   again\r\n\r\ndominated   their   political  common   sense.   This\r\n\r\namendment is politically unwise for Singapore. It  is\r\n\r\neven  politically  unwise for  the  Liberal-Socialist\r\n\r\nParty,  and  I  am afraid they must have  noted  with\r\n\r\nconsiderable  dismay this morning  that  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  devoted  a  very lengthy  leading  article  to\r\n\r\nsaying how politically unwise they had been in moving\r\n\r\nit.

I  do not think that we, at least,  wish  to\r\n\r\nabuse  the  rules  of the Assembly  or  infringe  the\r\n\r\nrights   of   the   minority,  but  from   a   purely\r\n\r\nhumanitarian   motive  of  pity  for   the   Liberal-Socialists,  I suggest that we might consider  moving\r\n\r\nthat  the  question  be  now  put  and  we  get  this\r\n\r\namendment out of the way.

Some friends then  told\r\n\r\nme that I was being unfair to the Liberal-Socialists.\r\n\r\nThe  amendment  proposed  by  the  Liberal-Socialists\r\n\r\nproves that I was not mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refusal of the British Government to agree to\r\n\r\nthe minimum demands of the people of Singapore caused\r\n\r\nthe breakdown of the talks.

The\r\n\r\noutstanding characteristic of this Party is its  fear\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore. They can only be happy if\r\n\r\nthere  are British policemen to protect them  against\r\n\r\ntheir  own  people.

Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Personally, Sir, I have not\r\n\r\ndisturbed  anyone. You might have noticed that,  Sir,\r\n\r\nand  I feel that I should be given the same right not\r\n\r\nto be disturbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, India had to carry her fight for independence\r\n\r\nfor  80 to 90 years. Here we have a Member who always\r\n\r\nquotes  Mr Nehru. I think he has studied  Mr  Nehru\r\n\r\nand India in theory but not in practical politics  at\r\n\r\nall.  India,  Ceylon  and even  Burma  have  attained\r\n\r\nindependence after a lot of suffering. The people  of\r\n\r\nthis  country have not suffered, and I hope they will\r\n\r\nnot.   Things  have  changed.  The  people  of  India\r\n\r\naccepted   constitutional  advancement   by   interim\r\n\r\nstages.  Not only that, but they consented to  divide\r\n\r\nthe  country  into two parts - India and Pakistan.  We\r\n\r\nalso have an example in Palestine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the delegation went as an All Parry Delegation\r\n\r\nto  London,  we  heard  of quarrels  and  dissensions\r\n\r\nwithin  the  delegation. But the Chief Minister  said\r\n\r\nthat  they presented a united front at the conference\r\n\r\ntable.  I  am  very happy to hear that.  But  when  a\r\n\r\ncertain  stage was reached in the negotiations  where\r\n\r\nneither  side  would give way at all, it  was  wise - I\r\n\r\nwould  say,  very wise - on our part, remembering  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is only 226 square miles in area and having\r\n\r\na  population of just over a million people, to  have\r\n\r\ntaken the maximum offer from the Colonial Office  and\r\n\r\nto work for more later. What was wrong with it, I ask\r\n\r\nyou,  Sir?  We have accepted the Rendel Constitution.\r\n\r\nThose  Members who oppose it are still sitting  tight\r\n\r\nin  their places. They do not want to leave.  But  in\r\n\r\nother  countries,  Sir,  if any  political  party  or\r\n\r\nmembers of any political party do not agree with  the\r\n\r\nconstitution,  they immediately resign  and  ask  for\r\n\r\nfresh   elections.   They   will   not   work    that\r\n\r\nconstitution.  But here I see those Members  who  say\r\n\r\nthey do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwant  the constitution but are still sticking to  it.\r\n\r\nWhat  for? Are they sincere themselves? If they were,\r\n\r\nthey  would  have  resigned,  especially  after   the\r\n\r\nMerdeka talks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my argument is that our movement for\r\n\r\nindependence is only in its infancy. It is a  postwar\r\n\r\nperiod  movement.  In 1948 we had  only  six  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives. After that, we had nine. Now we have\r\n\r\n25.  Had  not the London talks broken down, we  would\r\n\r\nhave  got  50 seats - all elected. Then we  could  have\r\n\r\nasked  for fresh elections, ascertained the  majority\r\n\r\nopinion on Merdeka, and go back to London and ask for\r\n\r\nmore concessions. I think it would have been sensible\r\n\r\nof  the delegation to accept the maximum offer of the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office.  It  would have  meant  a  definite\r\n\r\nconstitutional   advancement  in  our  constitutional\r\n\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.A.P. - if we trace the history of this Assembly,\r\n\r\nwhat  have  they  done?  It  is  supposed  to  be  an\r\n\r\nextremist  Party. Before going to London, they  said,\r\n\r\n\"We want to accept 75 per cent Merdeka.\" Why? If they\r\n\r\nwanted  freedom, then why be satisfied  with  75  per\r\n\r\ncent Merdeka? If the Colonial Office's offer had been\r\n\r\naccepted, then we would have got citizenship  rights.\r\n\r\nSome  people would have got voting rights  and  would\r\n\r\nhave a hand in electing people to this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a distinction was made out between the\r\n\r\ncolonial  power  and  the British  people.  I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand the distinction at all. It is the  British\r\n\r\npeople who elect their representatives to Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe  Government is formed by the majority party. Then\r\n\r\nthe  Cabinet,  or  the various departments,  run  the\r\n\r\ngovernment.  What  is  the opinion  of  the  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice is the opinion of the British Cabinet, and  is\r\n\r\nthe  opinion  of  the  British people.  It  is  quite\r\n\r\ninseparable.  Do not forget that the  British  people\r\n\r\nelect   their   representatives  to  Parliament   and\r\n\r\nParliament is their voice. There is no distinction at\r\n\r\nall. It is no use saying that once we have elected\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem,  we  do  not believe in them. It is impossible.\r\n\r\nSir,  as  I  have  said,  no  country  had  immediate\r\n\r\nindependence and I feel that the maximum offer of the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office  should have been  accepted  and  we\r\n\r\nwould then have been better off, in the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\ntoday  I rise to speak as an independent nationalist.\r\n\r\nI  am  speaking on the amendment which is  associated\r\n\r\nwith the Party to which I once belonged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the House knows that I was the Member\r\n\r\nwho, during the last day of the London talks, moved a\r\n\r\n15-minute adjournment to allow the delegation to have\r\n\r\na  private  discussion.  During  that  adjournment  I\r\n\r\nproposed  that  we  should accept the  British  offer\r\n\r\nunder protest. I pointed out to the delegates at this\r\n\r\nmeeting  that we must admit that there was already  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  advancement in our constitution  if  the\r\n\r\nBritish  offer  was  accepted,  especially   as   the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office  had  recognised  the  principle  of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation and agreed to hand over control of the\r\n\r\npolice  force  to  us. I said the  delegation  should\r\n\r\nrealise  the  fact that the British offer  would  not\r\n\r\ncompletely satisfy the actual wants of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  that we must go  back  and  tell  the\r\n\r\npeople the truth - that we could not get what we wanted\r\n\r\nand what we bad promised during our Merdeka Week.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, we would ask all Parties to  sign  a\r\n\r\njoint  undertaking that no political Party  in  power\r\n\r\nwould  allow  Her  Majesty's  Government  over-riding\r\n\r\npowers to intervene in any minor issue, since it  was\r\n\r\ndeclared by the Secretary of State, the Rt. Hon.  Mr\r\n\r\nLennox-Boyd,   that  the  British   Government   were\r\n\r\nconcerned  only  with external affairs  and  external\r\n\r\ndefence.  We knew very well that the Colonial  Office\r\n\r\nwere  trying  all  the time to take over  control  of\r\n\r\ninternal security in the name of external defence and\r\n\r\nexternal  affairs. I said I hoped  that  all  Parties\r\n\r\nwould  agree to sign a joint undertaking and let  the\r\n\r\nColonial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice know that they had unanimously agreed that the\r\n\r\nBritish Government should not intervene in any  minor\r\n\r\nissue of internal administration. I even went to  the\r\n\r\nextent  of  urging the delegation to  cable  back  to\r\n\r\nSingapore   to  cancel  the  arrangements   which   I\r\n\r\nunderstood  were  under way to  welcome  the  Merdeka\r\n\r\nMission  back from London; that we should protest  to\r\n\r\nthe  British  Colonial Office for dishonouring  their\r\n\r\npromise  made  last December to the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister that they would allow us to enjoy a  certain\r\n\r\nstatus  that  is  more than internal self-government,\r\n\r\nsomething that is nearer to Dominion status. I  think\r\n\r\nwe can get this information from the White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the first day of the conference meetings, we\r\n\r\nalready could feel that the Colonial Office were  not\r\n\r\nsincere  in keeping their promise. The Rt.  Hon.  Mr\r\n\r\nLennox-Boyd, in his opening speech at the conference,\r\n\r\nstated  that  the  British Government  did  not  want\r\n\r\nSingapore to become an outpost of Peking, or  even  a\r\n\r\ncolony  of Peking. That was not true, because through\r\n\r\nmy  personal  connections  with  several  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  and  some Government departments,  I  was\r\n\r\nprivately  told that Mr Lennox-Boyd  knew  that  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Government  in Peking had  no  intention  of\r\n\r\ncoming   into  South-East  Asia,  which,  of  course,\r\n\r\nincludes  Malaya and Singapore. I think  Mr  Lennox-Boyd  purposely  emphasised that possibility  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech. I think the Hon. the Chief Minister can still\r\n\r\nremember how I felt. I thought that since we conceded\r\n\r\ncontrol   over  external  affairs  to  Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment, what then would be the position when  the\r\n\r\nquestion  arose  of  Singapore's admission  into  the\r\n\r\nUnited Nations Organisation? I was so innocent! I was\r\n\r\nso   optimistic,  because  I  was  even  thinking  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's   admission  into  the   United   Nations\r\n\r\nOrganisation! But after Mr Lennox Boyd's speech, all\r\n\r\nmy  hopes  were  dashed to the ground;  I  became  so\r\n\r\npessimistic. I think the local Press reported it. But\r\n\r\nI must admit that we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  achieved  something  up  to  that  stage.  So  I\r\n\r\nproposed that 15-minute adjournment in order to  urge\r\n\r\nupon   the  delegation  to  be  a  little  bit   more\r\n\r\nrealistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not agree with the Chief Minister when he\r\n\r\nsaid  that  it  would not be good to eat  a  poisoned\r\n\r\ncake.  The  Labour Front's platform is  to  work  the\r\n\r\nRendel   Constitution   for   four   years - the   then\r\n\r\nProgressive Party, ten years - and yet, after a year's\r\n\r\nworking,    we    could   ask   for   a   significant\r\n\r\nconstitutional advance. Therefore, why should we  not\r\n\r\ndevote   time  to  trying  out  the  new  Lennox-Boyd\r\n\r\nconstitution? We could come back from London and tell\r\n\r\nthe   people   that  we  could  not   get   what   we\r\n\r\nwanted - immediate independence - but we could tell  them\r\n\r\nthat  the  British Government had promised to  review\r\n\r\nthe  position  after two years' working  of  the  new\r\n\r\nconstitution.  We could then educate our  people  and\r\n\r\nreorganise our nationalist movement for independence.\r\n\r\nMaybe in one year, maybe in six months, we could  get\r\n\r\nDominion status. That was what I told the delegation,\r\n\r\nbut  my  proposal did not have a seconder,  not  even\r\n\r\nfrom my colleagues! [Interruption.] No, I am speaking\r\n\r\nnow as -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. The hon. Member must\r\n\r\nremember  that he is addressing the Chair, and  there\r\n\r\ncannot be any asides with Members on the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. Then we came\r\n\r\nto the voting. The voting was most harmful to me. Now\r\n\r\nmany  people  call me a lost political trustee.  \"Lim\r\n\r\nCher Kheng is bribed by David Marshall for $100,000!\"\r\n\r\nSo  my proposal was turned down, first, because I did\r\n\r\nnot  even have a seconder, and, secondly, I  did  not\r\n\r\nhave  any chance for a fair voting because the leader\r\n\r\nof the delegation, the Chief Minister, said the talks\r\n\r\nmust  break down. We all knew the procedure at  these\r\n\r\ndelegation meetings. If all Parties agreed, then  the\r\n\r\nleader  of the delegation could go back and tell  Mr\r\n\r\nLennox Boyd, \"All the delegates agree. This is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  stand.\"  But if a certain delegate abstained  or\r\n\r\nspoke  against the matter under discussion, I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  the Chief Minister could go back and tell  Mr\r\n\r\nLennox-Boyd  that the delegates had agreed.  Although\r\n\r\nthere  would  be  a  majority decision,  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment and the whole world would know that  there\r\n\r\nwere  certain  members  in  the  delegation  who  had\r\n\r\ndisagreed with the leader of the Merdeka Mission.  At\r\n\r\nthe  delegation meetings I never regarded  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  as  the  leader  of  the  Labour  Front.  I\r\n\r\nregarded   him  as  the  leader  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. I can let Mr Marshall down, but I  cannot\r\n\r\nlet the people of Singapore down. For the dignity  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore, I said, \"David, I  am  with\r\n\r\nyou!\"  And  even today I maintain that I  was  right.\r\n\r\nTherefore   I  find  that  I  have  no  grounds   for\r\n\r\nsupporting this amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, this is indeed a\r\n\r\nfrightening amendment, frightening in the sense  that\r\n\r\nit  implies  that  the country and  the  people  have\r\n\r\nsuffered  the  loss of a good deal of confidence  and\r\n\r\nstability,  and because it further implies  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  should be aware of the true state of affairs.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  people of Singapore, as  far  as  I  know,\r\n\r\nunderstood  fully the contents of the recommendations\r\n\r\nmade  by the delegation at the London conference  and\r\n\r\nthe  reasons  for its failure, and I cannot  see  any\r\n\r\nreason  why  anybody should go and frighten  them  by\r\n\r\nsaying, \"Look, you have lost a lot of confidence.  We\r\n\r\nhave  no  stability in this country and we should  do\r\n\r\nsomething about it.\" Therefore, I feel, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nkeynote  of  this amendment is absolute fear  in  the\r\n\r\nmind of the mover, and if anybody supports it, he  is\r\n\r\nalso afraid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, Sir, if I want to fight for freedom from\r\n\r\nslavery  and  to  achieve political  emancipation,  I\r\n\r\nshould have to fight to get rid of fear. I should  be\r\n\r\nfree  from fear; and that is the main thing  to  tell\r\n\r\nthe people - that if we are going to fight for freedom,\r\n\r\nwe must rid our minds of fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think that the Liberal-Socialist Party is\r\n\r\nmisleading the people by frightening them. They  feel\r\n\r\nthat if freedom comes to us politically, capital will\r\n\r\nfly  away; individual liberty will fly away and there\r\n\r\nwill  be  nothing left for the people. This stand  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely untrue and if this propaganda of fear goes\r\n\r\non  in  the  minds of the people, the Party  will  be\r\n\r\ndoing a great disservice to the future generation.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that the people should be taught that the first\r\n\r\nthing  to  achieve is freedom from fear, and  by  the\r\n\r\nguidance  of the political Parties - guidance  in  the\r\n\r\nright  direction - we shall be in a position to educate\r\n\r\nthe people to achieve freedom, a freedom which we all\r\n\r\nwould like to have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, Sir, the reason for failure of the\r\n\r\ntalks   in  London  was  on  a  fundamentally   basic\r\n\r\nissue - the  issue whether Singapore is to  be  granted\r\n\r\ncomplete  internal self-government,  or  whether  the\r\n\r\ninternal   administration   should   be    a    mixed\r\n\r\nadministration  of the United Kingdom Government  and\r\n\r\nthat of Singapore. As far as I am concerned, Sir, the\r\n\r\ndelegation as a whole had shown to the people and the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Britain that the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwere  not  prepared to accept a mixed internal  self-government.  The  people of Singapore  want  a  self-government  through  which they can  attain  complete\r\n\r\nfreedom  from political rule, and to me this  is  the\r\n\r\nright  step  for them to take in order to  achieve  a\r\n\r\nfeeling of confidence and stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the United Kingdom Government\r\n\r\nhave  one  point  in  their mind.  The  international\r\n\r\nproblem confronting Britain is so top-heavy that they\r\n\r\ncould  not  even accede to a discussion  on  internal\r\n\r\nproblems. But the urge of the people of Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe will of the people of Singapore, demonstrated  to\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom through a resolution approved  by\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly, were reasons that prompted the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  to  open this discussion. It  has  now  been\r\n\r\nestablished  beyond  all  doubt  that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndelegation had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen exceptionally smart in winning for the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore a just solution. It may be incomplete,  but\r\n\r\nI feel that we should not take that too seriously. We\r\n\r\nhave  made  a  beginning and if we  are  sincere  and\r\n\r\nhonest  with  the  people of Singapore,  not  in  the\r\n\r\ndistant  future but in the near future,  we  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  attain the freedom that we are  anxious  to\r\n\r\nget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment will mislead the people. It\r\n\r\nwill  confuse them to such an extent that  they  will\r\n\r\nnot be able to know what this Assembly want, and what\r\n\r\nthe Government want. On those grounds, I feel that it\r\n\r\nis completely irrelevant to the whole question of our\r\n\r\nfight for freedom, and I oppose the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the big arm of\r\n\r\nthe  Liberal-Socialists represented here were members\r\n\r\nof  the now defunct Progressive Party. May they  rest\r\n\r\nin peace! During the seven years that the Progressive\r\n\r\nParty held sway in the Legislative Council before the\r\n\r\ncoming  into  force of the Rendel Constitution,  they\r\n\r\nwere  wont  to  bask in the glory of  their  colonial\r\n\r\nmasters,  so much so that the verdict of  the  public\r\n\r\nduring   the  last  general  election  was  clear - the\r\n\r\nProgressive Party could be trusted no more. Hence the\r\n\r\ndefeat  of  all their stalwarts. I thought  they  had\r\n\r\nlearnt  their  mistakes when  they  merged  with  the\r\n\r\nDemocratic  Party and gave birth to that strange  and\r\n\r\nincomprehensible product - the Liberal-Socialist Party.\r\n\r\nThe  public, however, Sir, has not been taken  in  by\r\n\r\nthis change of front, which is nothing but a sham  to\r\n\r\nhoodwink  the electorate. By their antics, they  have\r\n\r\ndisclosed  their  true  colours.  I  find   it   very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  understand their  political  ideology,\r\n\r\nbecause they are neither Liberals nor Socialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Serangoon was speaking\r\n\r\nyesterday, I stood up on a point of clarification.

Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister,  in\r\n\r\nmoving  his substantive motion yesterday, endeavoured\r\n\r\nto  give  the Liberal-Socialists a political lift  in\r\n\r\nthe   estimation  of  the  public,   and   even   the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the P.A.P. - who are most violent in\r\n\r\ntheir  criticism  of the Liberal-Socialists - in  their\r\n\r\nspeeches yesterday had no ill-feelings towards  them.\r\n\r\nWhy  were these friendly overtures made to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon  who, I believe now,  must  have  been\r\n\r\nmesmerised by the leader of the P.A.P. who said  that\r\n\r\nthe  man  must be getting mad? Why did we make  these\r\n\r\nfriendly overtures to the Liberal-Socialists, Sir? It\r\n\r\nis  because we believe, and believe rightly, that  we\r\n\r\nnow  must have a common, united, non-Communist  front\r\n\r\nif  the next delegation going to London to resume the\r\n\r\nfight  for  freedom were to succeed. We believe  that\r\n\r\nsuccess could only be attained if we could speak from\r\n\r\na  position  of  strength.  If,  Sir,  they  had  any\r\n\r\npolitical acumen, they would have cashed in on  these\r\n\r\nfriendly overtures and thereby draw strength from  us\r\n\r\nfor  the battle that is to come. But what do we  see?\r\n\r\nWe see the ridiculous spectacle of a political Party,\r\n\r\nwhich  claims to fight for the inalienable rights  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore, crumbling just because  the\r\n\r\nColonial Office\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  applied  the whip, and now they are prepared  to\r\n\r\ndebase  the  dignity of the people  of  Singapore  by\r\n\r\nsaying  that the delegation should have accepted  the\r\n\r\noffer   of   Her   Majesty's  Government.   Did   the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the  Liberal-Socialists  express\r\n\r\nsuch  an  opinion in London? They did not.  When  the\r\n\r\nfateful  question was put to them whether or not  the\r\n\r\ndelegation  should accept the offer of Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment, they abstained from voting, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Point of order.

They  really  abstained,  whatever   the\r\n\r\nquestion   was.  \"Do  you  agree  with  our   stand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Abstain.\"  If  they  wished to  accept  the  British\r\n\r\noffer,  they could have said, \"We are against.\"  But,\r\n\r\nno, they abstained, because at that time they did not\r\n\r\nhave the courage of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  convictions, or maybe at that time  they  were\r\n\r\nnot  yet so repentant as they are now since they came\r\n\r\nback  to Singapore. Three of them abstained, but  the\r\n\r\nfourth  representative - the Member for  Changi - was  so\r\n\r\nfed up to the teeth with them that he openly declared\r\n\r\nyesterday, \"I do not want party politics any more.  I\r\n\r\ndeclare  myself  an independent.\" And he  dissociated\r\n\r\nhimself  from membership of a Party that  is  neither\r\n\r\nLiberal nor Socialist. In London, Sir, they said  one\r\n\r\nthing and now in Singapore they say another, and  yet\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Tanglin  talked  of  cynicism  and\r\n\r\npolitical  dishonesty! Can he please tell me  how  he\r\n\r\nwould describe the behaviour of his own Party members\r\n\r\nwhen  in  London they said they abstained  and  today\r\n\r\nhere they say the delegation should have accepted?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Absolutely correct!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> All right, all right!

In\r\n\r\nLondon,  when there was an indication of  a  possible\r\n\r\nbreakdown  in  the  talks,  we  received  news   from\r\n\r\nSingapore that the Liberal-Socialists were so brazen-faced  as  to  announce that they  were  willing  and\r\n\r\nprepared to take over the government!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> My god!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

This  stand  of   the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment  went right against their own  professions\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to  the  future  of  Singapore.  It  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  me  to  see,  Sir,  how  any  genuine\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the people of Singapore can fail to\r\n\r\ncondemn  the  stand  taken by the British  Government\r\n\r\nduring  the talks; and what about the stand taken  by\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  delegation?  Foreign  observers  were\r\n\r\nsurprised by the modesty of Singapore's claims.  What\r\n\r\nour   delegation  asked  for  did   not   amount   to\r\n\r\nindependence.  They  only asked  for  complete  self-government  and  conceded to  Britain  the  right  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  external defence and foreign  affairs.  Even\r\n\r\nthese   modest  ambitions  were  frustrated  by   the\r\n\r\nattitude  of  the  British  Government;  perhaps  our\r\n\r\nmodesty   was   our  main  enemy.  The  response   of\r\n\r\ncolonialism to modesty had been arrogant. It has been\r\n\r\nso   in  other  colonial  territories.  However,  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of the British Government has achieved  one\r\n\r\nthing. It has brought about a growing realisation  on\r\n\r\nthe part of the people of Singapore that the unity of\r\n\r\nall   anti-colonial  forces  is  essential.  It   has\r\n\r\nstrengthened  the  people in their  determination  to\r\n\r\nbring colonialism to an early end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The English language Press and interested elements\r\n\r\nhave been trying to put the blame for the failure  of\r\n\r\nthe  talks on our Chief Minister. I say to this, Sir,\r\n\r\n\"It  is  utter rubbish.\" The Hon. the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  proved  loyal  to the mandate of  the  All-Party\r\n\r\nDelegation right to the end. It is, of course, in the\r\n\r\ninterest of the Colonial Office and its henchmen that\r\n\r\nthey  should pretend to be innocent in trying to  put\r\n\r\nthe blame on others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that this Assembly by voting for the\r\n\r\nmotion  before  the House will give the  lie  to  the\r\n\r\ncheap and dishonest propaganda carried on against the\r\n\r\nHon. the Chief Minister by the English Press. It is a\r\n\r\ntribute  to  the patience and reasonableness  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  who took  the  breakdown  with\r\n\r\ncalmness. The attitude of the British Government has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naroused  more contempt for Britain than anger against\r\n\r\nher; contempt, because she is so slow in learning the\r\n\r\nlessons of history; contempt, because at a time  when\r\n\r\ncolonialism  is  on  its last  legs  everywhere,  she\r\n\r\nthinks  she  can  maintain  her  law - a  fortress   of\r\n\r\ncolonialism    in    the    resurgence    of    Asian\r\n\r\nnationalism - and  contempt for those  who  only  learn\r\n\r\ntheir lessons too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> In reply, Sir. I would like to\r\n\r\ndeal, Sir, with a few points that have arisen in this\r\n\r\ndebate  and  I  shall start with Mr  Sutherland.  He\r\n\r\nreferred  yesterday, Sir, to the threat of  Communism\r\n\r\nas  being  one  of  the reasons why  we  should  have\r\n\r\nconceded   this  day-to-day  foreign   control   over\r\n\r\ninternal  security. Now, Sir, I would ask  him  this:\r\n\r\ndoes  he  really believe that colonialism  can  fight\r\n\r\nCommunism,  that colonialism can keep  out  Communism\r\n\r\nand  that  imperial bayonets and bullets do keep  out\r\n\r\nCommunism?  For  more  than a  decade  in  this  very\r\n\r\nterritory, Sir - which is a colonial territory - and  our\r\n\r\nsister  territory  across the  Straits,  which  is  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  territory, we have seen Communism  flourish\r\n\r\nand thumb its nose at the bayonets and the bullets of\r\n\r\nimperialism.  It feeds on colonialism. The  existence\r\n\r\nof  colonialism  makes it possible for  Communism  to\r\n\r\nthrive. It is because we ourselves feel very strongly\r\n\r\nabout  the  Communist threat that we have refused  to\r\n\r\nmake ourselves partners to this fraud upon the people\r\n\r\nin  the  continuation of colonial rule; that we  have\r\n\r\nsought a position of stability, of political freedom;\r\n\r\nthat  we have got to be masters in our own house and,\r\n\r\nas  masters  in  our own house, meet  the  threat  of\r\n\r\ndestruction  from  within. Sir, I have  spoken  these\r\n\r\nwords before and they may well fall on deaf ears;  if\r\n\r\nhe  would  permit me to quote, and I  trust  he  will\r\n\r\nlisten with respect to some words of the President of\r\n\r\nthe United States of America delivered on the 25th of\r\n\r\nMay, 1956 - only 13 days ago - I shall trouble the House,\r\n\r\nSir, with a few paragraphs which are interesting  and\r\n\r\nworthwhile:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Today a militant aggressive Communist doctrine is\r\n\r\ndominant  over much of the world's surface  and  over\r\n\r\nhundreds of millions of the world's people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the postwar period, we have seen it indulged in a\r\n\r\nparticular  cynical type of colonialism  (he  is  not\r\n\r\nreferring  to the Colonial Office) expressed  in  the\r\n\r\nCommunist subjugation of once free and proud  nations\r\n\r\nin Europe and Asia. Simultaneously, in the free areas\r\n\r\nof the world, 600 million people in more than a score\r\n\r\nof new countries have achieved independence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communism denies a spiritual premise on which\r\n\r\neducation has been based. According to that  doctrine\r\n\r\nthere is no God, there is no soul in man; there is no\r\n\r\nreward   beyond  the  satisfaction  of  daily  needs.\r\n\r\nConsequently,  for  the  human  being,  Communism  is\r\n\r\ncruel,    intolerant,   atheistic.   This   doctrine,\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  conquest  by  lure,  intimidation  and\r\n\r\nforce,  seeks  to destroy the political concepts  and\r\n\r\ninstitutions  that  we hold to be  dearer  than  life\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus Communism poses a threat from which even this\r\n\r\nmighty nation is not wholly immune. Yet Communism  in\r\n\r\nits  deepest sense is a gigantic failure. Even in the\r\n\r\ncountries  that dominate, hundreds of millions  there\r\n\r\nstill  cling  to  their religious faiths,  still  are\r\n\r\nmoved  by  aspirations for justice and  for  freedom,\r\n\r\nstill  dream of the day when they can walk fearlessly\r\n\r\nin the fullness of human freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Just  as we in Singapore subject to the authoritarian\r\n\r\nrule  of the Colonial Office dream of walking in  the\r\n\r\nfullness of freedom. Two more paragraphs, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The destiny of man is freedom and justice under his\r\n\r\nCreator.  Any  ideology  that denies  this  universal\r\n\r\nfaith  will ultimately perish or be recast.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe  first  great  truth that must underlie  all  our\r\n\r\nthinking, all our striving in this struggling world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second truth is that the fundamental principles of\r\n\r\nhuman  liberty  and  free government  are  powerful\r\n\r\nforces  of  human energy, loyalty and dedication  and\r\n\r\nguides  to  enduring success. They are mightier  than\r\n\r\narmaments and armies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is what we sought for the people, Sir. We sought\r\n\r\nto  give  an opportunity for the powerful sources  of\r\n\r\nhuman  energy, loyalty and dedication to guide us  to\r\n\r\nsuccess  over  this  threat. We  tried  to  make  the\r\n\r\nBritish people realise this truth, that freedom is  a\r\n\r\ngreater  force  against Communism than armaments  and\r\n\r\narmies.  The threat is there and I say you  will  not\r\n\r\nmeet  it by the perpetuation of colonialism. You will\r\n\r\nonly  strengthen it and it may well destroy the  very\r\n\r\ninterests which Mr Sutherland and I seek to  protect\r\n\r\nbecause, Sir, though\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey will not see it, the long-term interests of this\r\n\r\nColony are at one with the long-term interests of the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom. In the final analysis, we are on  the\r\n\r\nsame  side  of  the table but, for the present,  they\r\n\r\nwould be blind. That is my answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sutherland - I trust who did not seek to be\r\n\r\nunfair - has   made  selective  quotations   from   the\r\n\r\nvernacular  Press to prove that the vernacular  Press\r\n\r\nwas against Merdeka and for acceptance of the British\r\n\r\noffer.  I  have read the Chung Shing Jit Pao  of  the\r\n\r\n19th  of  May  and  I lay it on the  table  for  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  to  judge  whether the  excerpts  which  Mr\r\n\r\nSutherland read were, in fact, fair to that paper and\r\n\r\nas  for  the Tamil Murasu, Sir, it is hopping mad.  I\r\n\r\nhave got this morning's paper and you will permit  me\r\n\r\nto read it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr Sutherland alleged that the Tamil Murasu also\r\n\r\nhad  written stating that the time was not  ripe  and\r\n\r\nsuitable for full internal self-government. What  the\r\n\r\nTamil Murasu had stated in its editorial on the  18th\r\n\r\nof  May  is  that  it  is  the  British  Government's\r\n\r\nargument  that  the conditions of Singapore  are  not\r\n\r\nsuitable for complete self-government. The experience\r\n\r\nof  the people to take over the responsibility of the\r\n\r\nadministration  is  very,  very  little - that  is  the\r\n\r\nBritish Government's view.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I continue:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Moreover, there are Communist activities here. They\r\n\r\nare  not  the  views  of  the  Tamil  Murasu  as  Mr\r\n\r\nSutherland  alleged. In fact, the  Tamil  Murasu  has\r\n\r\nbeen  backing with all its force at its  command  the\r\n\r\ndemands  of the Merdeka Mission for complete internal\r\n\r\nself-government for Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In one paragraph, it has stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"So far as the Merdeka talks are concerned, the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore could not find fault  with  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister.  Right  to  the  end,  he  acted  in\r\n\r\naccordance   with  the  unanimous  opinion   of   the\r\n\r\ndelegation.  It had to be accepted that  nobody  else\r\n\r\ncould  have  discussed Singapore's demand  for  self-government  as efficiently as he did.  It  is  indeed\r\n\r\ncurious that the British Government is ready to grant\r\n\r\nindependence  to the Federation, which  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime brings out the permanent bugbear as a reason for\r\n\r\ndenying independence to Singapore. It is clear,  from\r\n\r\nthese  passages, what the Tamil Murasu, the organ  of\r\n\r\nthe Malayan Tamils, stands for.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  seems  to me that there is an apology due  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  add  this  since  the  question   of\r\n\r\nvernacular  papers has come up: one of my first  acts\r\n\r\non returning from England was to call in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese  editors  and, at a separate conference,  the\r\n\r\nMalay  editors, to thank them for their honest  stand\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  the  aspirations  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\npeople,  to  thank them for the genuine support  they\r\n\r\ngave and for their clear understanding of the issues.\r\n\r\nLet  us  be  clear, Sir, as to where  we  stand.  The\r\n\r\nChinese  Press, the Tamil Press and the  Malay  Press\r\n\r\nare  domiciled. They understand the feelings  of  the\r\n\r\nMalayans. They do not represent the transient's view.\r\n\r\nThey  do not have loyalties which blind them to  the\r\n\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speech, Sir, apart from some inaccuracies\r\n\r\nand  opinions  with  which I do not  hold - it  was  an\r\n\r\neminently  able  one - there was an unhappy  discordant\r\n\r\nnote struck by Mr Sutherland. He said in ending  up,\r\n\r\n\"I  will not censure my Colonial Office.\" What is the\r\n\r\ndistinction, Sir, between the attitude of a  man  who\r\n\r\nwill not censure his own Government department, right\r\n\r\nor  wrong,  and  the  attitude of  a  man  under  the\r\n\r\nCommunists or under the Fascists? None of them do. It\r\n\r\nis  democracy that gives us the right to speak openly\r\n\r\nand  to criticise where there is wrong and I am  more\r\n\r\nthan  a  little ashamed of an Englishman who has  not\r\n\r\nthe courage to criticise his own Colonial Office when\r\n\r\nit  is  wrong. I should have thought that  they  have\r\n\r\nmore courage than that, Sir, and are capable of being\r\n\r\nloyal and yet critical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) who, I\r\n\r\nam  sure,  would not seek to be unfair, has suggested\r\n\r\nthat  I  was seeking to cover up the disunity in  the\r\n\r\ndelegation  and there is an implication  that  I  was\r\n\r\nseeking to do this for some ulterior motive.  Let  me\r\n\r\nrepeat once more, Sir, and I say this in honesty  and\r\n\r\nsincerity.     Disunity    there     was - considerable\r\n\r\ndisunity - but  this  was behind  the  scenes  and  all\r\n\r\nParties  should  be congratulated on  the  manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich they succeeded ultimately in a miraculous unity\r\n\r\nin  facing  the  Colonial Office  at  the  conference\r\n\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi said that all Parties\r\n\r\nindulged  in  party  politics.  I  am  sure  he   was\r\n\r\nbedevilled and bewildered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat some of his colleagues in his own Party but let us\r\n\r\nbe  fair to those on the Government Benches. He  must\r\n\r\nappreciate  that we suffered humiliation  quietly  at\r\n\r\nthe  hands of the arrogant Secretary of the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  and we took it because  we  strove  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  unity. He must remember the  time  when  he\r\n\r\nsaid  to  me,  \"Do not be so soft. Throw  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nout\";  and he must recognise today that we were right\r\n\r\nin  being  patient and that strong measures  at  that\r\n\r\ntime  would  have broken up any unity and would  have\r\n\r\nbrought  the  odium  of breakdown  on  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndelegation  and  not  where  it  truly  rests - on  the\r\n\r\nColonial Office. Sir, the Labour Front did not at any\r\n\r\ntime  nor  did any individual member indulge  in  any\r\n\r\nparty politics. Let us be fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) said,\r\n\r\n\"If we cannot have this poisoned cake, what about the\r\n\r\nRendel  Constitution? Is it not much worse than  this\r\n\r\npoisoned cake?\" I could not agree more, Sir. This  is\r\n\r\nworse than a poisoned cake. It is gilded muck. But we\r\n\r\ndid  not  put  our  hand to this Rendel  Constitution\r\n\r\nvoluntarily.  The  people of Singapore  did  not  put\r\n\r\ntheir signatures and accept it for years to come.  We\r\n\r\nare  free to fight it and we will fight it.  What  we\r\n\r\nwould have done in London though had we accepted this\r\n\r\nconstitution  was  voluntarily in  the  name  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore to put our hand to it and to  tie\r\n\r\nthem hand and foot for years to the constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> No, two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

There would have been  a\r\n\r\nright  to  review  after two years but  no  right  to\r\n\r\ncompel  rectification.  We would  merely  retain  the\r\n\r\nstatus  quo when no agreement was reached.  We  would\r\n\r\nstill go back to the original constitution. So it was\r\n\r\ntying  this  country hand and foot to  an  agreement,\r\n\r\nwhich, I repeat, is worthy only of contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) - and I think the\r\n\r\nMember  for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) - has put  the\r\n\r\nargument more clearly when he said, \"Why not  proceed\r\n\r\nstep by step? Why not take half a loaf and then go on\r\n\r\nto  more?\" Sir, the best way to answer that  argument\r\n\r\nis  to try and repeat to you the argument of a member\r\n\r\nof  the delegation who sought to advise us to accept.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) was there\r\n\r\nand  he  will  remember and this is how the  argument\r\n\r\nwent.  He said, \"Let us take it. We will have control\r\n\r\nof  Malayanisation.  We  will  have  control  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice.  We  would  have organised  the  country  and\r\n\r\nworked  up  antagonism against the British  and  then\r\n\r\nthrow  them  into the sea\"; and that is just  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  would have happened because if we had  accepted\r\n\r\nthis  constitution,  we  would  have  all  come  back\r\n\r\nfighting  and  there would have been  no  distinction\r\n\r\nbetween   the  Labour  Front,  the  P.A.P. or   the\r\n\r\nCommunists. Would this have made for stability?  That\r\n\r\nis  what the Member for Stamford (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy)\r\n\r\nwas trying to explain. We were fighting for long-term\r\n\r\nstability and to have accepted this constitution,  to\r\n\r\nhave  worked,  to have returned to a state  where  we\r\n\r\nwould all have to work up anti-racial antagonism  and\r\n\r\nanti-British  antagonism,  would  have  destroyed  any\r\n\r\npossibility of stability, because it would have  been\r\n\r\nfor  a  period of years. The British could have  said\r\n\r\nquite rightly, \"Look, you agreed to this. No more  of\r\n\r\nthis nonsense. We are not going to see you\" and,  for\r\n\r\na  period of years, we would have to stomach and work\r\n\r\nup  an ulcer that would have finally spoilt the whole\r\n\r\nset-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have listened to all the arguments and I\r\n\r\nmust  say  that  not one argument has been  presented\r\n\r\nwhich has not underlined the correctness of our  move\r\n\r\nin  rejecting  this constitution.

I cannot bring  a\r\n\r\nvote  of censure on myself, Sir, and I think it  must\r\n\r\nbe  admitted that I am giving the fullest opportunity\r\n\r\nto  those who may wish to do so. Because, Sir, it  is\r\n\r\nnot permitted to assume of any Member of the Assembly\r\n\r\nthat his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconduct   should   be   ascribed   to   irrepressible\r\n\r\nunscrupulousness sparked by the malice  of  jealousy,\r\n\r\nwe  must  assume that he has acted with  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  In the circumstances,  Sir,  I  must\r\n\r\nassume  that when the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  (Mr\r\n\r\nLee Kuan Yew) called a Press conference in London  on\r\n\r\nthe very morning of the 17th of May when I was making\r\n\r\nefforts  to reopen the constitutional conference,  to\r\n\r\nhis   knowledge,  and  publicly  made  the  filthiest\r\n\r\naccusations against me, he was acting with a sense of\r\n\r\nresponsibility. It is true that by his actions he not\r\n\r\nonly  sullied me, sullied the whole delegation which\r\n\r\nhad  just  finished  negotiations with  the  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice,  but  he  also  sullied  the  reputation   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, in the very country where we were  seeking\r\n\r\nto justify our claim for political freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State for the Colonies owes the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar a debt of gratitude to  have\r\n\r\ngiven  him  the opportunity to say on the morning  of\r\n\r\nthe  18th  of  May in the House of Commons  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore delegation had \"clearly disintegrated\"  and\r\n\r\nto  put on record in his White Paper his view of that\r\n\r\ndisintegration thereby seeking to throw the odium  of\r\n\r\nthe breakdown onto the Singapore delegation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I returned to Singapore, Sir, I found that the\r\n\r\nEnglish  Press  had taken the cue of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar and sought to lead the  country  in  a\r\n\r\ncampaign of virulent abuse that made me the scapegoat\r\n\r\nof  the frustrations of defeat. I consider that  this\r\n\r\nsadistic pastime, in which the Press of Singapore and\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  Assembly have  indulged  of  bear-baiting  the  Chief  Minister, is  dangerous  to  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of the country and to the self-respect of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. If a Member  of  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nwishes  to  attack the Chief Minister  or  any  other\r\n\r\nMinister, the proper forum for such attack is to face\r\n\r\nhim  openly  in this Assembly and not to go  stabbing\r\n\r\nhim in the back by one-sided Press statements. In the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, Sir, in order to bring this  important\r\n\r\nprinciple  home,  I  have, as my last  act  as  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  brought this motion so that  I  trust  the\r\n\r\nMembers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  this Assembly and the people of this country will\r\n\r\nappreciate  that  the proper forum for  criticism  by\r\n\r\nAssemblymen of Assemblymen and Ministers is here  and\r\n\r\nI now give an opportunity to those who have so foully\r\n\r\nreviled  me  in  my  absence  to  condemn  me  in  my\r\n\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar spoke truly\r\n\r\nyesterday  when  he said that, on the  night  of  the\r\n\r\nbreakdown of the conference, I had no idea whatsoever\r\n\r\nof  reopening  the  talks,  but  he  must  have  been\r\n\r\nconscious  that I had not the slightest intention  of\r\n\r\ngiving  up the struggle for freedom from colonialism.\r\n\r\nThe  talks broke down at about 4.30. Between 4.30 and\r\n\r\n11   o'clock   that  night,  I  gave  two  television\r\n\r\ninterviews, several radio interviews and I  addressed\r\n\r\na  large  gathering  at  a  public  meeting.  On  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  morning, I considered it my duty  to  hand\r\n\r\nover  all  the  conference papers of  both  sides  to\r\n\r\nvarious  newspapers  and I took them  to  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament including Members of the Labour  Party.  I\r\n\r\nthen  learnt that at 3 p.m., the Secretary  of  State\r\n\r\nwas going to make a statement on Singapore. I did not\r\n\r\nlearn  it from the Colonial Office, Sir, but I learnt\r\n\r\nit from some friends who are Members of the House.  I\r\n\r\nmanaged to rush from one of my meetings to the  House\r\n\r\nof  Commons  and there heard the Secretary  of  State\r\n\r\nexplain that the breakdown of the talks, as you  have\r\n\r\nheard  from  Hansard, was absolutely, completely  and\r\n\r\nentirely due to our refusing him powers over external\r\n\r\ndefence and foreign affairs. Mr Noel Baker, who  was\r\n\r\nthere, was good enough to assist me and when he heard\r\n\r\nthat  I  disagreed with the interpretation  suggested\r\n\r\nthat he call a Press conference at which I could give\r\n\r\nmy  own views of the subject, but before doing so,  I\r\n\r\nasked  for  an  interview with  the  leaders  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish Labour Party and, at that interview, whilst I\r\n\r\nwas trying to explain to them why I did not trust the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office - whereas I am completely  willing  to\r\n\r\ntrust  the British people and the House of Commons - an\r\n\r\nidea occurred to me. I put this to them and they, who\r\n\r\nare  experienced and impartial, said  that  the  idea\r\n\r\ncertainly had the possibility of an honest compromise\r\n\r\nand it might well be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npossible  to  reopen  the  negotiations  before   the\r\n\r\nbreakdown had turned cold. I then returned  in  haste\r\n\r\nto  the  flat  and called an urgent  meeting  of  the\r\n\r\ndelegation  for 6 p.m. This was, Sir, Wednesday,  the\r\n\r\n16th  of May. Only a few delegates turned up  and  it\r\n\r\nwas  quite obvious that they were suffering from  the\r\n\r\nlassitude and depression of defeat. I did not wish to\r\n\r\npress  it  further. I asked them all  and  I  sent  a\r\n\r\nmessage  to  the remainder to come to the flat  again\r\n\r\nfor  a  final  meeting  at 9  o'clock  the  following\r\n\r\nmorning.   That   same  night  as  you   are   aware,\r\n\r\nSir - Wednesday  night - at the end of a very  pleasant\r\n\r\nsocial evening and at the request of the Secretary of\r\n\r\nState,  I  accompanied  him to  his  home  and,  from\r\n\r\nmidnight  till  2  a.m., we discussed  this  idea  for\r\n\r\nreopening the talks. He and his Minister of State for\r\n\r\nthe  Colonies were present and when we ended up, they\r\n\r\nboth  suggested  that they would  wish  to  know  the\r\n\r\nreaction  of  the  remainder of the delegates  before\r\n\r\nthey  would give their own views. So it was  arranged\r\n\r\nthat there should be a social function - a tea party - at\r\n\r\nwhich  to  attempt an informal sounding of individual\r\n\r\nmembers before the matter was taken up on an official\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at nine the following morning, the delegates\r\n\r\nwere  there  and  I  found that  in  so  far  as  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties  were  concerned,  they  had,  it\r\n\r\nseemed,   received  Party  mandates  and   were   not\r\n\r\ninterested in reopening the talks. I asked whether  I\r\n\r\nmight,  on my own responsibility, make this  approach\r\n\r\nand  this was agreed to. The Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nwas present and he himself said, \"If you want to make\r\n\r\nit on your own responsibility, you can do so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> When was this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If, it please you, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nit  in mind. I have a chronology. Sir, on the 15th we\r\n\r\nfailed;  on  the  16th there was a statement  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse  of  Commons  at 3 p.m.; on the  16th,  was  my\r\n\r\nsocial  function with the Secretary of State for  the\r\n\r\nColonies, on the 16th also, at 6 p.m., was my meeting\r\n\r\nof the delegates and on the 17th morning, was my next\r\n\r\nand final meeting. From there, we rushed, I think, to\r\n\r\nthe  B.B.C. for a broadcast \"Calling Asia\".  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanjong Pagar will now remember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar, although it was\r\n\r\nagreed   that   I   should  do   this   on   my   own\r\n\r\nresponsibility, lost no time in making impossible the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  the  approach and he proceeded  to  take\r\n\r\nsteps,  very successfully, to torpedo my efforts.  He\r\n\r\ncalled a Press conference at which he indulged in the\r\n\r\nmost  scurrilous abuse of me and of the idea and then\r\n\r\nproceeded  to manoeuvre amongst the other members  of\r\n\r\nthe delegation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar seems to have the\r\n\r\neffect  on some people of a hooded cobra on a rabbit.\r\n\r\nHe  fascinates them and then he hypnotizes them  into\r\n\r\ndocility and unthinking obedience. You know what  the\r\n\r\nresult was of that effort to reopen negotiations.  On\r\n\r\nthe  morning of the 17th, I put my conversation  with\r\n\r\nthe Secretary of State in writing and he received the\r\n\r\nletter on the same day. Now, Sir, what was this idea?\r\n\r\nIf I may read the letter, Sir - it is not very long:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Since the breakdown of the Conference on Tuesday an\r\n\r\nidea  for  a  new  approach to  our  differences  has\r\n\r\noccurred  to me. I am putting forward the  suggestion\r\n\r\ncontained   in  this  letter  entirely  on   my   own\r\n\r\ninitiative  and  responsibility. You  are  aware  how\r\n\r\nrepugnant  the whole principle of over-riding  powers\r\n\r\nof  legislation is to me personally and how dangerous\r\n\r\nI  consider the existence of such powers  is  to  the\r\n\r\nprinciple I seek to establish of stable and  friendly\r\n\r\nrelations  with  the United Kingdom.  These  imperial\r\n\r\npowers  of  legislation (as defined by you)  are  far\r\n\r\noutside  the scope of what is normally understood  by\r\n\r\nthe phrase 'external defence'. This question of over-riding  powers is also very repugnant to the majority\r\n\r\nof  my  colleagues and in the circumstances I do  not\r\n\r\nwish to raise the matter with them again until I have\r\n\r\nsome assurance that there is a prospect that my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuggestion would be acceptable to the Colonial Office\r\n\r\nas a basis for negotiation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion is this: -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that the over-riding powers of legislation by\r\n\r\nOrders in Council and Emergency Regulations sought by\r\n\r\nyou,  in  the context of your proposal  for  the\r\n\r\ncomposition of the Defence and Security Council,\r\n\r\nshould be subject to affirmative resolution of the\r\n\r\nHouse  of Commons (such approval to be prior  or\r\n\r\nsubsequent as the circumstances require);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in order to meet the very real need of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore for  an  end  of  colonial\r\n\r\nrule,   the   relationship  of  the   State   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  with  the United  Kingdom  should  be\r\n\r\noutside the scope of the Colonial Office and  in\r\n\r\nany other Ministry as may seem appropriate;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that there should be a representative of Her\r\n\r\nMajesty in Singapore as the head of the State in\r\n\r\nSingapore through whom the loyalty of the people of\r\n\r\nthis nascent state would find a means of coalescing.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's representative should be a Malayan and\r\n\r\ncompletely distinct from the political representative\r\n\r\nof Her Majesty's Government in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you consider this a basis for re-opening\r\n\r\nnegotiations, I should be glad to hear from  you  and\r\n\r\nwill  seek  to persuade my colleagues to agree.  Such\r\n\r\nresumption   of  negotiations  would  be   completely\r\n\r\nwithout  prejudice  to any decisions,  which  may  be\r\n\r\ntaken  by either side after full examination  of  the\r\n\r\nimplications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you have put a great deal of effort into\r\n\r\nthese  negotiations at a time when you  are  burdened\r\n\r\nwith  very heavy responsibilities in connection  with\r\n\r\nother  territories.  We of the  Singapore  delegation\r\n\r\nhave  also  been  through  a  period  of  strain   in\r\n\r\nstretching  to the uttermost our anxious  efforts  to\r\n\r\nachieve agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite agreeable to any arrangement whereby the\r\n\r\nresumption of the Conference should take place  after\r\n\r\na short period of rest, during which both sides would\r\n\r\nundertake  to issue no statement or press interviews.\r\n\r\n(This  was, Sir, to meet his particular circumstances\r\n\r\nthat he had planned a ten-day yachting holiday).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this suggestion proves unacceptable to you and\r\n\r\nthis becomes my last official communication with  you\r\n\r\npermit  me to express my appreciation of the personal\r\n\r\nfriendliness  you  have  shown  towards  me  and   my\r\n\r\nadmiration for your very real abilities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. It has been pointed out\r\n\r\nto  me that possibly the Governor's recommendation or\r\n\r\nconsent has not yet been signified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am indeed indebted to you,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir. I keep forgetting  this  is  the\r\n\r\nRendel Constitution. His Excellency the Governor  has\r\n\r\ngiven his consent for this motion to be considered by\r\n\r\nthe Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that last phrase, I was taunted with it by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Tanglin (Mr  Ede)  that  I  should\r\n\r\nexpress  admiration  for  Mr Lennox-Boyd's  ability.\r\n\r\nWell,  let  me say this and I repeat it: I  have  the\r\n\r\nhighest regard for that man's ability. He is an asset\r\n\r\nto  any side for which he bats and I am sorry  he  is\r\n\r\nbatting  for the Colonial Office. That does not  mean\r\n\r\nthat I respect his policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I may explain these three ingredients of my\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  I  think  I  have  made  it  clear   how\r\n\r\ndangerous  I  considered  the  over-riding   imperial\r\n\r\nlegislative  powers which the Colonial Office  sought\r\n\r\nto  retain  but  if, in fact, it was  no  longer  the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office  that would be responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nrelationship of Singapore with the United Kingdom but\r\n\r\nsome  other Ministry accustomed to dealing with human\r\n\r\nbeings as equals, and if - that is the main \"if\" - before\r\n\r\nthe  British High Commissioner could use these  over-riding  powers he had to seek the approval and public\r\n\r\ndebate of the House of Commons, I considered that the\r\n\r\nimperial  over-riding legislative  powers  would,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  if not in theory, become almost a dead letter.\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is true that the Conservative Party  has  a\r\n\r\nmajority.  It is also true that they can  steamroller\r\n\r\nanything they want but to work on that basis would be\r\n\r\nto  say,  \"Let  us have one election and  close  down\r\n\r\nParliament and the majority can do what it  pleases.\"\r\n\r\nThat,  in  fact,  as  hon.  Members  in  these  short\r\n\r\nfourteen  months of this Government have  learnt,  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  way  democracy works and the  fact  that  a\r\n\r\nmatter has to come before the House of Commons,  that\r\n\r\nit  has  to be publicly debated and it has to  submit\r\n\r\nitself  to  the  full  glare of the  country's  Press\r\n\r\npublicity,  would  be a very grave deterrent  to  any\r\n\r\nmisuse of those powers. It is true that the continual\r\n\r\nexistence  of these powers even with this  protection\r\n\r\nwould be an irritation to the people of Singapore but\r\n\r\nno  British civil servant would have dared to seek to\r\n\r\ninterfere in our daily life when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  knew  that he had to obtain the sanction  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse of Commons and his conduct would come under the\r\n\r\nscrutiny  of Members of both sides of the  House  and\r\n\r\nthe people of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir - it may be a little difficult for the man-in-the-street to understand - I have followed with interest\r\n\r\nparliamentary  procedure and traditions  for  a  long\r\n\r\ntime  and  I  was  satisfied  in  my  mind  that  the\r\n\r\nacceptance   of  these  provisions  and   affirmative\r\n\r\nresolution in the House of Commons would, to a  large\r\n\r\nextent,  nullify the evil of the over-riding  powers.\r\n\r\nIt would, shall we say, be an agent to counteract the\r\n\r\npoison in the cake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second request, Sir, was one that merely\r\n\r\nrepeated   what   the  delegation  had   consistently\r\n\r\ninsisted  on - the transfer of our relations  with  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom from the Colonial Office  to  another\r\n\r\nMinistry.   To  those  who  have  not  suffered   the\r\n\r\nauthoritarian rule and traditions of arrogance of the\r\n\r\nColonial   Office   and   its   inhumanity   in   the\r\n\r\nexploitation of its empire, this might seem  a  small\r\n\r\nmatter.  But to me and to many of us, this is  not  a\r\n\r\ntrimming  as the Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim  Choon\r\n\r\nMong) suggested. This is a matter of importance  both\r\n\r\nas  to  content and as to psychological  effect.  The\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore would then  be  conscious  that\r\n\r\nthere was an end to colonial rule and we ourselves in\r\n\r\nour  relations with the United Kingdom would be  able\r\n\r\nto  deal  with persons who have traditions of dealing\r\n\r\nwith  human  beings as equals and  not  as  imbecilic\r\n\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and last ingredient of my suggestion,\r\n\r\nSir,  was  that  the British could  have  their  High\r\n\r\nCommissioner. Very well, let him be the  Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe Defence and Security Council but he should not be\r\n\r\nthe  head of the State of Singapore. We could not  be\r\n\r\nexpected   to   give  our  loyalty  to  a   political\r\n\r\nrepresentative of Her Majesty's Government with  whom\r\n\r\nwe  might be in constant conflict on various  aspects\r\n\r\nof  the  constitution. It is impossible, Sir, to  ask\r\n\r\nthe people genuinely to give their loyalty to such  a\r\n\r\npersonality.  We therefore said we wanted  a  Malayan\r\n\r\nGovernor-General who would not be a representative of\r\n\r\nHer   Majesty's   Government   but   would   be   the\r\n\r\nrepresentative of Her Majesty with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant  though decorative functions of the  Queen.\r\n\r\nIn  this fashion, we hoped to have the opportunity to\r\n\r\ncoalesce our feelings of loyalty and through this  to\r\n\r\ngrow   to  full  nationhood.  When  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  says,  \"There  is  no  difference  between\r\n\r\nGovernor and Governor-General\", he showed, if  I  may\r\n\r\nsay  so, Sir, a complete lack of understanding of the\r\n\r\npolitical  content  of  these  different  posts.  The\r\n\r\ndifference is the same as between Mr Hitler and  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty  Queen  Elizabeth II. One is a constitutional\r\n\r\nmonarch acting on the advice of Her Ministers and  in\r\n\r\nno way interfering her personality in the politics of\r\n\r\nthe day - which would be a Malayan Governor-General - and\r\n\r\nthe other is a dictator as is our Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, I received a message on the early\r\n\r\nmorning of the 18th - again from a friend in the  House\r\n\r\nof Commons and not from the Secretary of State - saying\r\n\r\nto  me,  \"You said that you did not get a reply  from\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary of State to your letter. Well,  he  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  reply  to you in public in  the  House  of\r\n\r\nCommons at eleven o'clock.\" So I rushed down  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse   of   Commons,  Sir,  and  to   my   delighted\r\n\r\nastonishment, I heard him say - I read from column 2381\r\n\r\nof  Hansard,  Vol. 552, No. 157 of the 18th  of  May,\r\n\r\n1956:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\"The Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd):</b> I was approached early yesterday by the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister of Singapore (This is, Sir, after  he\r\n\r\nhas   received  my  letter)  proposing  a  basis  for\r\n\r\nresumption of negotiations. As a consequence, I asked\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  delegation  to  meet  me  informally.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  out of the twelve delegates  who  are\r\n\r\nstill  in London, only the Chief Minister and two  of\r\n\r\nhis  Government colleagues found themselves  able  to\r\n\r\nattend. When I asked whether these proposals had  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the delegation he replied they were purely\r\n\r\nhis personal suggestions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, listen to this, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I stated that I was perfectly ready to discuss\r\n\r\nthese  proposals (in the plural) provided  that  they\r\n\r\nwere  put forward either by the delegation or by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at 5.30 that afternoon, I received his letter\r\n\r\non  page  2 and you will notice there that he  merely\r\n\r\nreferred  to  one  ingredient of  my  suggestion  and\r\n\r\nconveniently,  may  I say it, intentionally,  ignored\r\n\r\nthe remaining two. That letter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas   received   by  me  after  his   departure   for\r\n\r\nSouthampton - no doubt, an accident. In any event, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  sat  down and wrote the letter at page 3  pleading\r\n\r\nfor  clarification  and I asked the  Colonial  Office\r\n\r\nthat it be delivered to the Secretary of State. I was\r\n\r\ntold that the Secretary of State was on the high seas\r\n\r\nand  would not surface for ten days. So I asked  that\r\n\r\nit be sent by despatch rider to the Minister of State\r\n\r\nfor  the Colonies who had already gone to his country\r\n\r\nhome  and  I contacted him by telephone. I  was  told\r\n\r\nthat  I  need  not  expect a  reply  till  I  reached\r\n\r\nSingapore, but, in fact, I did get a reply, Sir.  You\r\n\r\nwill find at page 4 from the Minister of State on the\r\n\r\nnight  before  my  early  departure  for  Delhi   and\r\n\r\nSingapore - the  night of the 20th - I received  this  in\r\n\r\nwhich  he said, \"I should be in no doubt as  to  what\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary of State meant\", but he still did  not\r\n\r\nsay what he meant. Sir, I wrote to him a reply on the\r\n\r\nsame  night  and I taxed him with the  terms  of  his\r\n\r\nletter when he was good enough to come and see me off\r\n\r\nat the airport on the following morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true we had a conversation then but it was a\r\n\r\nconversation  which the Minister of State  emphasised\r\n\r\nwas  not  for  publication in any aspect  and  it  is\r\n\r\ntherefore with some surprise and not a little disgust\r\n\r\nthat I find the Secretary of State in his telegram of\r\n\r\nthe  30th  of  May  referring to these  conversations\r\n\r\nwhich were supposed to be private in every aspect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was more than a little astonished at the\r\n\r\nextraordinary reaction in Singapore to my efforts  to\r\n\r\nreopen  negotiations and I asked my loyal friend  and\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Minister for Labour and Welfare  (Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Yew Hock), \"Can you understand?\" He said to  me,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  to  the  Chinese population, your  action  in\r\n\r\nrushing  back  to push open the door  that  they  had\r\n\r\nslammed  in your face was undignified\" and he  quoted\r\n\r\nto  me, Sir, the Chinese proverb about the swallowing\r\n\r\nback of your phlegm once you have spat it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry if there are citizens in this city\r\n\r\nwho  consider  that  my action in seeking  to  reopen\r\n\r\nnegotiations was undignified and to them I  will  say\r\n\r\nthis: I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink dignity has its place at the proper time but if\r\n\r\ndignity  interferes with the welfare of  the  people,\r\n\r\nthen  it is not only unrewarding and sterile, it  can\r\n\r\nbe criminal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I attended the House of Commons on the\r\n\r\nafternoon  of Wednesday, the 16th of May, I  realised\r\n\r\nthat  here was an opportunity either for forcing  the\r\n\r\nreopening  of  the talks or for making known  to  the\r\n\r\nwhole  world  in  the clearest possible  fashion  the\r\n\r\nhumbug  of  the  Colonial Office  and  their  blatant\r\n\r\nunreasonableness.  Either  way,  we  stood  to  gain.\r\n\r\nEither way it was for the benefit of Singapore. Was I\r\n\r\nto  sit on my bottom with injured pride and sorrowful\r\n\r\ndignity  when I could do something to help?  That  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  way  I  live,  Sir.  Since  there  was   an\r\n\r\nopportunity to do some good, I took it even if I  had\r\n\r\nto take it alone just as I welcomed the invitation to\r\n\r\nbreak  my stay at New Delhi in order to acquaint  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  of India - that very human  and  truly\r\n\r\ngreat  man - of the true facts of the case in the  hope\r\n\r\nthat  when he does discuss it - as I understand he will\r\n\r\ndiscuss   it  at  the  forthcoming  Prime  Ministers'\r\n\r\nConference - he  would at least be fully  cognizant  of\r\n\r\nour own point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has any good resulted from my effort to force the\r\n\r\nreopening  of  negotiations? If I am  to  believe  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  no good has resulted for me  personally.\r\n\r\nThey say that if I had returned immediately after the\r\n\r\nbreakdown,  I would have been a hero, but  thanks  to\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  I  gave to the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  (Mr  Lee Kuan Yew) and to the English  Press,\r\n\r\nalmost  the entire population of Singapore was misled\r\n\r\nas  to the nature of my efforts. I do say this,  Sir:\r\n\r\nmy  efforts, if they have achieved nothing else, have\r\n\r\nproved  two  things.  They have  proved  the  genuine\r\n\r\nanxiety  of the people of Singapore for an honourable\r\n\r\npeace  with  the  United Kingdom and  for  an  honest\r\n\r\nconstitution. They have also permitted world  opinion\r\n\r\nto penetrate the sanctimonious smokescreen of British\r\n\r\npropaganda and enabled the world to judge of the ugly\r\n\r\nbrutality of the new British colonial policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This much is now clear as I indicated yesterday.\r\n\r\nThere  are only two issues dividing the Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState  from  me  as these letters  prove.  One  is  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  Governor-General; and let us make it  clear:\r\n\r\nthis  does  not interfere with the appointment  of  a\r\n\r\nBritish  High  Commissioner to  be  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nDefence and Security Council. That is their business.\r\n\r\nWe  want our Governor-General to be a Malayan and the\r\n\r\nsecond  thing  Sir,  is  to  transfer  us  from   the\r\n\r\njurisdiction  of  the  Colonial  Office  to   another\r\n\r\nMinistry. Only these two things separate us  and  yet\r\n\r\nwe have Prime Ministers saying, \"The breakdown of the\r\n\r\nconstitutional talks is due to powers  over  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity\"; and we have the Secretary of State saying,\r\n\r\n\"No,  no,  the breakdown is due to external defence.\"\r\n\r\nHow  is  it possible - I would ask not only this  House\r\n\r\nbut  I would ask the world that listens - to twist  the\r\n\r\ntruth  to such an extent as to pretend that  the  two\r\n\r\nissues  now remaining between the Secretary of  State\r\n\r\nand  myself  can be deemed to affect either  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  or external defence? I have not known  even\r\n\r\nCommunist  propaganda go the length of  such  blatant\r\n\r\nlies - I repeat lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is good for the people of Singapore and\r\n\r\nworld  public opinion to have these issues clear-cut.\r\n\r\nI still hope that once the hurt pride of the Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice is mollified by the diplomacy of my successor,\r\n\r\nit will give way to the pressure of world opinion and\r\n\r\nespecially  Asian  opinion and  let  me  add  English\r\n\r\nopinion,  too, Sir, because when I was in England,  I\r\n\r\nwas  satisfied that if it was English public  opinion\r\n\r\nor  even if it was the House of Commons that  was  to\r\n\r\ndecide  our  fate  and to decide freely  without  the\r\n\r\ncoercion  of  a  Whip, we would  have  got  our  very\r\n\r\nmoderate and very honest aims and plans. I would  not\r\n\r\nlike  to  believe,  Sir,  that  the  failure  of  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional conference in fact and in truth ushers\r\n\r\nin  a new era and tolls the knell of passing day  for\r\n\r\nthe  humanitarian  policy and principles  which  made\r\n\r\npossible the retention by the United Kingdom  of  the\r\n\r\nfriendship  and  co-operation of  her  colonies,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  I say, Sir, that my efforts in seeking  to\r\n\r\nreopen  these negotiations, although they  have  been\r\n\r\nabortive - and in this as to who is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  blame, I let the Assembly judge from the  recital\r\n\r\nof  the  facts - they have, in fact, clarified  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  mind the real issues and the public not  only\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  and  of  England  but  of  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries  now  recognise  that  there  is  no  truth\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  in  the Colonial Office propaganda  about\r\n\r\nexternal defence and foreign affairs.

I was supposed\r\n\r\nto  be  elsewhere at this moment. I still have to  go\r\n\r\nvery shortly but may I just speak on the position  as\r\n\r\nI saw it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday, 15th May, the talks broke down. It\r\n\r\nbroke  down  on  the question of who was  to  be  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Defence and Security Council and  who\r\n\r\nwas  to have the last word on the necessity for these\r\n\r\nover-riding  powers of legislation. It  was  a  vital\r\n\r\nprinciple  which we had discussed for at  least  five\r\n\r\npreceding  days and we decided, on Tuesday,  that  we\r\n\r\ncould  not yield and that we had to stand  firm.  It\r\n\r\nwas a matter of principle and we stood firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think anyone can be more vehement\r\n\r\nthan  the  Hon. the Chief Minister when he  denounced\r\n\r\nthe  proposal  as bad, wicked and poisonous.  I  have\r\n\r\nhere  with me the English morning papers of  May  the\r\n\r\n16th.  They  have  more  or less  fair  and  accurate\r\n\r\nreports of the series of Press conferences and.  T.V.\r\n\r\ninterviews  held by our Chief Minister that  evening,\r\n\r\ntogether with one public meeting where I was  on  the\r\n\r\nsame  platform. One report which gives a fair  report\r\n\r\nis the one in the Manchester Guardian. It said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Singapore constitutional talks were broken off\r\n\r\nlast  evening  with no agreement reached.  Mr  David\r\n\r\nMarshall,  the  Chief  Minister  and  leader  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore delegation, will fly home on Sunday - earlier\r\n\r\nif he can get a seat on a plane - and will then resign.\r\n\r\nHe has so informed the Governor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  is in London. It is understood that the Governor\r\n\r\ncannot  accept his resignation until they both return\r\n\r\nto Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall was in a bitter, angry mood on\r\n\r\nemerging  from the final meeting, and at an impromptu\r\n\r\nPress  conference, he used violent  and  ill-tempered\r\n\r\nwords.  If,  he said, there were fresh  elections  in\r\n\r\nSingapore as a result of his resignation he  and  his\r\n\r\nParty  would  boycott  them - or rather,  he  said,  on\r\n\r\nsecond  thoughts, they would put up  advanced  lepers\r\n\r\nfor election and return lepers to show their contempt\r\n\r\nfor the present Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then it goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"One need not question the genuineness of Mr\r\n\r\nMarshall's disappointment at the break-down of  these\r\n\r\ntalks - \"it  was  the  greatest  disappointment  of  my\r\n\r\nlife\", he said. But it was embarrassing to witness so\r\n\r\nfrank  and uncontrolled an exhibition of it,  It  did\r\n\r\nnot inspire...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  if  we did not agree with those statements,  we\r\n\r\nwould  have dissociated ourselves from them. He spoke\r\n\r\nas  the leader of the delegation. Though we ourselves\r\n\r\nmight   have   chosen  less  vehement  language,   we\r\n\r\ngenerally shared the sentiments he expressed. But  it\r\n\r\nis  important,  when  we conduct  the  affairs  of  a\r\n\r\npeople, that we should not only say what we feel, but\r\n\r\nalso  act  in a manner which leaves nobody  in  doubt\r\n\r\nthat we have acted according to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, Sir, there was no lassitude of defeat\r\n\r\nas  far as I remember. I went round St. James Park in\r\n\r\nthe  morning  to shake off the ill-effects  of  smoky\r\n\r\nconference rooms. I had a sturdy lunch -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Lucky man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - and I sat down to read the\r\n\r\nafternoon  papers  one  of  which  was  the   Evening\r\n\r\nStandard  and  I  think  this picture  of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  described  the feeling of  the  delegation:\r\n\r\nanger,  frustration and a slight touch of bitterness.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock, I received a telephone call from the\r\n\r\nsecretary  of  the  delegation, Mr  Hoffman.  I  was\r\n\r\ninformed  that  there  was to be  a  meeting  of  all\r\n\r\ndelegates at six. I was astounded, because I  thought\r\n\r\nthat  henceforth we would just march on  holding  one\r\n\r\npublic meeting after another. Perhaps on a Sunday  we\r\n\r\nwould  hold  a  mass  protest  rally  of  10,000   in\r\n\r\nTrafalgar Square just like the Cypriots did the  week\r\n\r\nbefore. The students were or-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nganising  protest meetings. The Movement for Colonial\r\n\r\nFreedom  was  organising a protest  meeting.  When  I\r\n\r\nasked  the secretary what it was about, he said  that\r\n\r\nthere was a possibility of reopening the talks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so this was one of the lighter moments those of\r\n\r\nus  who were in London shared: I went to wake  up  my\r\n\r\nfriend  and  back-seat driver the  Member  for  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  (Mr Lim Ching Siong) who shared my  flat.  He\r\n\r\nwas  fast  asleep - I do not know whether it  was  the\r\n\r\nheavy, tiring and tedious labour of the conference. I\r\n\r\nshook him up and said, \"We have a meeting at six. You\r\n\r\nknow  we are going to reopen the talks.\" He stood  up\r\n\r\nand looked at me astounded and he said, \"Go away.  Do\r\n\r\nnot  play  fool with me.\" So I said, \"No,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nplaying the fool. There is a meeting at six\"  and  we\r\n\r\nwent  and  so  did  the Member for Tiong  Bahru  (Mr\r\n\r\nWilliam  Tan).  I think our memory on this  point  is\r\n\r\nquite  clear.  It  was  the Wednesday  following  the\r\n\r\nbreakdown  and  we told the Hon. the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nthat  we could not share his point of view. We  could\r\n\r\nnot  stop him if he wished to do anything on his  own\r\n\r\ninitiative. In fact, on that occasion, I was somewhat\r\n\r\ndazed by it all. The one who was most vehement was my\r\n\r\nfriend  the Member for Tiong Bahru. However,  it  was\r\n\r\nall  confidential and I went off to dinner with  some\r\n\r\nfriends.  I  listened, with a sense of doom,  to  the\r\n\r\nseven  o'clock B.B.C. news which opened up  with  the\r\n\r\nheadline  that  the Chief Minister of  Singapore  was\r\n\r\nresigning. Then at ten o'clock the B.B.C. news  said,\r\n\r\n\"The  Chief Minister of Singapore has announced  that\r\n\r\nhe  has  a  fresh approach.\" Well, quite honestly,  I\r\n\r\nthought  that it was a serious breach of  confidence.\r\n\r\nWe  were told at six o'clock that the whole thing was\r\n\r\nin  confidence. At ten o'clock I heard  it  over  the\r\n\r\nB.B.C. I then said to myself, \"Well, since it is  now\r\n\r\npublic,  we  must publicly dissociate ourselves  from\r\n\r\nit.\"  So  we  called  a  Press  conference  for   the\r\n\r\nfollowing day at half-past eleven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the last sitting of this session. If\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have said of him has affronted the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister personally, I am sorry. Politically, I  will\r\n\r\nnot retract one word of what I have said. I acted  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of my Party and I am convinced that what I did\r\n\r\nwas  right,  that  my Party had to dissociate  itself\r\n\r\npublicly from a secret move which had become public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister flattered me when\r\n\r\nhe  said that I have an intense power of fascination\r\n\r\nover  other members of the delegation. I do not  want\r\n\r\nthat  compliment. I think it is an insult to them  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  they acted as a result of my  instigation.\r\n\r\nThey acted because I think they shared the feeling at\r\n\r\nthat  time that that was not the way in which affairs\r\n\r\nof state should have been conducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nobody in this House would be mad enough to\r\n\r\ntry  and  move  a motion of censure on the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister.  In fact, everyone would  like  this\r\n\r\nepisode  to  close gracefully and quietly. Unpleasant\r\n\r\nthings have already happened, and the less said about\r\n\r\nthem the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the letters which went between him and the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of State make melancholy reading.  I  felt\r\n\r\nthat  the  right thing to have done was to stop  when\r\n\r\nthe curtain dropped on the 15th. We decided before it\r\n\r\ndropped  that that was the right moment. I  still  do\r\n\r\nnot  believe  that  anything transpired  between  the\r\n\r\nbreakdown   of  the  conference  and  the   attempted\r\n\r\nreopening or the fresh approach 24 hours later  which\r\n\r\nhad  altered  the situation. We had weighed  all  the\r\n\r\npros and cons before we acted. There was nothing new.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  are asked to take note of these  papers\r\n\r\nand so we will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that whoever picks up from where the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister left off will be blessed with more\r\n\r\nfortune,  with more goodwill; perhaps also with  more\r\n\r\nunited support from a movement which we should  spend\r\n\r\nour  time  in  building. It  is  not  a  question  of\r\n\r\nconvincing the British people what nice and civilized\r\n\r\npeople  we  are  in Singapore. It is  a  question  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  up a movement which makes it quite  obvious\r\n\r\nto them that unless we are allowed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlook  after our affairs, we are likely to  take  some\r\n\r\ndrastic  steps  to put it into effect  against  their\r\n\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish the retiring Hon. Chief Minister a pleasant\r\n\r\nholiday.  Many  in this House, in spite  of  all  our\r\n\r\ndisagreements with him, would like to say that he did\r\n\r\nnot  spare himself in the conference; he worked hard,\r\n\r\nhe  believed in what he was doing and he went all out\r\n\r\nto  do it. Sometimes he was very wrong and I am sorry\r\n\r\nwe  had  to tell him that he was very wrong. However,\r\n\r\nall said and done, we wish him bon voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, though I have\r\n\r\nthe  pleasure  of  speaking on this motion,  actually\r\n\r\nthere is nothing much for me to say except to confirm\r\n\r\nmy statement yesterday that there were party politics\r\n\r\nand  disunity  within the delegation  at  the  London\r\n\r\ntalks.  Hon.  Members will remember  that  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister had earlier tried to cover this up by saying\r\n\r\nthat  the  disunity was only behind the  scenes,  but\r\n\r\njust  now  we heard him say that not only were  there\r\n\r\nparty  politics and disunity after the  breakdown  of\r\n\r\nthe   talks,  but  that  many  a  time  before   that\r\n\r\nhappened - at  public meetings, student gatherings  and\r\n\r\neven  at  cocktail  parties - the disunity  was  there,\r\n\r\nrunning beneath the surface like an undercurrent  and\r\n\r\nonly  awaiting the opportunity to come to the surface\r\n\r\nwhen party politics would be brought in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee\r\n\r\nKuan Yew) this: \"Why cannot he let the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nhave  a chance to reopen the negotiations on his  own\r\n\r\ninitiative?\" It was said that the Chief Minister  did\r\n\r\nnot  keep  his word, which he gave at 6  o'clock,  to\r\n\r\nkeep  confidential his move to reopen the talks  when\r\n\r\nat 10 o'clock the B.B.C. broadcast it. Why should the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar call a Press conference  on\r\n\r\nthe  following morning and say, \"This is  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nstand.\"  Was that not party politics? Why should  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. make clear its stand in London and not in this\r\n\r\nHouse? It is true that I told a certain reporter that\r\n\r\nI was also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsible for the reopening of the talks. I  should\r\n\r\nnow like to state the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I wish to declare that the meeting with some\r\n\r\nLabourite  Members  to  discuss  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nreopening  the talks was not prearranged. Second,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  correct to say, as the Chief  Minister  did,\r\n\r\nthat  the  tea party that the delegation attended  on\r\n\r\n17th  May  was  informal.  There  was  definitely  no\r\n\r\nmeeting on that day. No member of the delegation  was\r\n\r\nofficially  informed that there was  to  be  a  semi-official meeting - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> At 9 o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> No. But after the breakdown of\r\n\r\nthe  talks  on  16th May, yes, in  the  afternoon.  I\r\n\r\nchanced  to  be with the Member for Ulu Bedok  (Inche\r\n\r\nAbdul  Hamid  Bin  Haji  Jumat)  and,  I  think,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health (Mr Braga). We were talking when\r\n\r\nsuddenly  the Member for Ulu Bedok said, \"I think  it\r\n\r\nis  nice  for  us to go to the House of  Commons  and\r\n\r\nlisten  to the debate on the Merdeka talks.\"  It  was\r\n\r\nthen  about 3 o'clock. I thought that was a good idea\r\n\r\nand  we  went. About 20 minutes later, I  think,  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister joined us. We enjoyed the debate.  We\r\n\r\nappreciated the way in which the Rt. Hon.  Mr  James\r\n\r\nGriffiths and the Rt. Hon. Mr Aneurin Bevan went all\r\n\r\nout  to  press the Secretary of State to  reopen  the\r\n\r\nMerdeka   talks   and  they  emphasised   the   point\r\n\r\nrepeatedly that he must not let the door close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the debate, the Rt. Hon. Mr Bevan waved a\r\n\r\nhand at us and gave us a sign that we three - the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  the Member for Ulu Bedok and myself - should\r\n\r\njoin him in the lobby. We hurried to meet him. He was\r\n\r\njoined  by the Rt. Hon. Mr Creech Jones and  another\r\n\r\nfriend.  Then the Chief Minister said that since  the\r\n\r\nLabourite Members might not know much about the talks\r\n\r\nwith the Colonial Office, it was advisable to get all\r\n\r\nthe papers ready and he sent the Member for Ulu Bedok\r\n\r\nand myself to get them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  we  did  and  then  we went  into  one  of  the\r\n\r\ncommittee  rooms  to discuss the  matter.  The  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  put  his  case very clearly  to  the  three\r\n\r\nLabourites.  Then  he  had the idea  of  transferring\r\n\r\nSingapore  from  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice  to another Ministry. He said, \"Let us put  it\r\n\r\nthis  way.  We can trust the British people,  but  we\r\n\r\ncannot  trust  the Colonial Office.\" I think  it  was\r\n\r\nduring  this  time that one of the Labourites  asked,\r\n\r\n\"Do  you  not think it is better for us to  make  the\r\n\r\ninitial  arrangements to reopen the talks?\"  But  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister said, \"No, let me do it.\"  Thus,  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister was responsible for the initial  move\r\n\r\nto  reopen  the  talks.  Then  he  arranged  a  Press\r\n\r\nconference,  but I did not know when he arranged  it.\r\n\r\nDuring  this conference the Chief Minister repeatedly\r\n\r\nattacked  the Secretary of State, and the Member  for\r\n\r\nUlu  Bedok and I were quite unhappy about it. Because\r\n\r\nof  it,  I was forced to speak in Malay to the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, \"Tolong lah, chakap pendek sikit.\"  I  said,\r\n\r\nin  Malay, that since he was going to try and  reopen\r\n\r\nthe  talks, he should not spoil things by lashing the\r\n\r\nSecretary of State with his tongue. I had to stop him\r\n\r\ntwice by saying in Malay, \"Jangan chakap, tolong lah,\r\n\r\njangan chakap.\" That is the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we rushed back to the Chief Minister's flat\r\n\r\nand  had a meeting with the other delegates. My  then\r\n\r\ncolleague  the  Member for Tiong Bahru  (Mr  William\r\n\r\nTan)  asked, \"How can I face my friends if we  reopen\r\n\r\nthe  talks? It would be shameful!\" I think the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong  Pagar  (Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew)  said,  \"I\r\n\r\nstrongly reject the idea of reopening the talks.\" The\r\n\r\nMember for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong), I believe,\r\n\r\nremarked, \"All right, if the Chief Minister thinks it\r\n\r\nfitting to reopen the talks, he can go ahead  on  his\r\n\r\nown initiative.\" I can assure this House now that the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for reopening the Merdeka talks rested\r\n\r\nsolely on the shoulders of the Chief Minister. I  had\r\n\r\nexpected  to hear from the Chief Minister  after  his\r\n\r\nmeeting  with Mr Lennox-Boyd, but there was no  news\r\n\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  did  not  know that it was arranged that  the  tea\r\n\r\nparty  should be the occasion for semi-official talks\r\n\r\nbecause  we  did  not  have a meeting  the  following\r\n\r\nmorning.  We  did  not  know what  result  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  had from his meeting with the Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState. My Party's view was, \"Since we have failed  in\r\n\r\nthe talks, we are not very keen on going to this send-off  party  and say there, 'Goodbye, thank  you  very\r\n\r\nmuch.'  \"  So I did not attend the tea-party.  But  I\r\n\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to say that if  I\r\n\r\nhad known that the tea-party would be a semi-official\r\n\r\naffair, I would have attended it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking on the motion, I appreciate the spirit in\r\n\r\nwhich the Member for Tanjong Pagar puts it - that there\r\n\r\nis no need to censure the Chief Minister. For myself,\r\n\r\nI  think  the Hon. the Chief Minister did  the  right\r\n\r\nthing, and if the public want to throw mud at him,  I\r\n\r\nwould ask them to throw a little bit at me too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion\r\n\r\nhere  says  that  \"this Assembly takes  note  of  the\r\n\r\ncorrespondence\" and we also take note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand by what we said to the Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  at the last delegate meeting in London - that\r\n\r\nit  was just not done, for us - the representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore - to go back and ask  for  the\r\n\r\nreopening  of  the talks after the breakdown.  If  we\r\n\r\nwere  individuals, it would have been different.  But\r\n\r\nwe  represent the people of Singapore and I think  we\r\n\r\nshould know the feelings of the people.

Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had the\r\n\r\nopportunity   of  reading  these  letters   exchanged\r\n\r\nbetween  our  Chief Minister and  the  Rt.  Hon. the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of State for the Colonies, and I  came  to\r\n\r\nthe  conclusion  that our Chief  Minister  had  shown\r\n\r\nexceptional ability in the negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know, Sir, that the colonial language and\r\n\r\nthe  letter written by the Secretary of State for the\r\n\r\nColonies is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  example of colonial diplomacy. I feel sure,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat although some people of Singapore do not now see\r\n\r\nthe  wisdom of the actions of our Chief Minister, the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore would, in due course, understand\r\n\r\nthe  purpose for which the Chief Minister  has  stood\r\n\r\nand worked all along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These letters and the reports of the Mission have\r\n\r\nclearly  indicated  to the people  of  Singapore  the\r\n\r\nhonesty and sincerity of a man who has worked for the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  the people and who is still prepared  to\r\n\r\ncontinue his good work for the people. The relentless\r\n\r\nattacks on him from the Press have shown that in  him\r\n\r\nlies   the   future  of  the  people  of  Singapore - a\r\n\r\ncourageous  man  who  is  patriotic  and  who   still\r\n\r\nbelieves  in the sincerity of the people and  of  his\r\n\r\nown  Mission. I say this, Sir, because I had occasion\r\n\r\nto be present in the Press conference room on the day\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister arrived. After half an hour of the\r\n\r\nPress  conference,  I heard two European  journalists\r\n\r\ntalking to each other. One man was asking the  other,\r\n\r\n\"Now  that we have got these reports, what  shall  we\r\n\r\ndo?  Shall we praise him or shall we bury him?\"  That\r\n\r\nis  the attitude of the Press all along against  this\r\n\r\nman  who  has  been working for the  freedom  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. That is how  the  newspapermen\r\n\r\nlooked  at  the  man; and I say this,  Sir,  at  this\r\n\r\nsitting,  that  the people of Singapore  will  always\r\n\r\nappreciate the hard and sincere work which our  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister has done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope that his resignation and his absence from\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly will be a very short one  and  that  he\r\n\r\nwill come back to us and lead the people of Singapore\r\n\r\ntowards complete freedom and not a half Merdeka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly takes note of the correspondence\r\n\r\nbetween the Chief Minister and the Secretary of State\r\n\r\nfor  the Colonies between the 17th and the 30th  May,\r\n\r\n1956, as contained in Sessional Paper No. Misc, 2  of\r\n\r\n1956,  on  the  subject  of reopening  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitutional Conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LAND TITLES BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report from the Select Committee on the\r\n\r\nLand Titles Bill, as contained in Sessional Paper No.\r\n\r\nL.A. 3 of 1956, be adopted subject to the recommittal\r\n\r\nof  the Bill in respect of clause 2 to a Committee of\r\n\r\nthe whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I second it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Under  the\r\n\r\nexisting  legislation, the Board of Architects  fixes\r\n\r\nthe  architects' fees, subject to the approval of the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  The fees were last fixed by the Board  and\r\n\r\napproved by the Legislature in 1932 and now, in 1956,\r\n\r\nthe  Board has had a look at them and has proposed  a\r\n\r\nnew scale of fees, fixed after discussion, and it  is\r\n\r\nnow for the Assembly to decide whether to approve  it\r\n\r\nor  not. If the Assembly approves, then the new scale\r\n\r\nbecomes operative; if the Assembly disapproves,  then\r\n\r\nthe 1932 scale remains in operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing law gives this Assembly no power to\r\n\r\ndirect  the Board as to what fees should be  charged.\r\n\r\nIt  has  only the power of veto; it has no  power  of\r\n\r\ninitiative.  The choice, very simply, is between  the\r\n\r\n1932  scale  and the scale now proposed - 1956.  Before\r\n\r\ndiscussing  the new scale, I should like  to  explain\r\n\r\nthat this motion for changes in the scale of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfees  is only one stage in a general reassessment  of\r\n\r\nthe  professional organisation of our  architects.  I\r\n\r\nhave had valuable discussions with representatives of\r\n\r\nthe architects and I fully share their feeling of the\r\n\r\ngreat   need   to   strengthen   their   professional\r\n\r\norganisation.  In  the past, they have  maintained  a\r\n\r\nclose  link  with  the  Royal  Institute  of  British\r\n\r\nArchitects  and, in the earlier days  of  a  colonial\r\n\r\nterritory,  that  was no doubt very appropriate;  but\r\n\r\nnow   with   an   increasing  number  of   qualified\r\n\r\nprofessional men and with Singapore moving very  fast\r\n\r\ntowards independent nationhood - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I hope so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> - it is desirable that we should have\r\n\r\nalso  strong  local professional organisations  which\r\n\r\ncan  conduct  their  professional  affairs  on  lines\r\n\r\nappropriate   to  this  territory,  which   may   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily be the same in its local circumstances as\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom. I have no doubt that this build-up  of  our professional organisations can and should\r\n\r\nbe  done reasonably quickly. An essential step in the\r\n\r\nbuild-up  of  the  architect's  profession   is   the\r\n\r\nrecognition  of the civil engineering  degrees  which\r\n\r\nlarge  numbers of Malayans are seeking or have sought\r\n\r\nin Australia, so that having acquired the appropriate\r\n\r\ncivil engineering degrees in Australia, they can then\r\n\r\nsign  and  pass plans and function to that extent  as\r\n\r\narchitects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of getting their recognition accepted\r\n\r\nand    approved    and   working   out   satisfactory\r\n\r\narrangements has involved a great deal of work but it\r\n\r\nhas  been done and has been embodied in a Bill - I must\r\n\r\nnot  anticipate future business of the Assembly,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, but I can mention perhaps that I had  a\r\n\r\nBill  on  the  Assembly Order Paper which  I  had  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw - and  one of the provisions would  have  been\r\n\r\nallowing Malayans with civil engineering degrees from\r\n\r\nAustralia  to practise, as I have said.  However,  we\r\n\r\nhad  to  withdraw the Bill because the  life  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly was uncertain and it was obviously not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  justifiable case for a Certificate of Urgency  to\r\n\r\ngo  through  the  First, Second  and  Third  Readings\r\n\r\ntoday,  but  it  can be entered again  at  the  first\r\n\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to turn to this actual motion for approval,\r\n\r\nthe  First Schedule and the Second Schedule  together\r\n\r\nconstitute a useful advance. The First Schedule deals\r\n\r\nwith  conditions of engagement of architects and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  it  has  been drawn up so as to follow  pretty\r\n\r\nclosely the 1954 revisions of the Royal Institute  of\r\n\r\nBritish  Architects  in  the  United  Kingdom   which\r\n\r\nprovide  a satisfactory model for the purpose  wanted\r\n\r\nat  this  stage. I see no objection to those R.I.B.A.\r\n\r\nrequirements being followed for the time  being.  The\r\n\r\nrevised  conditions of engagement do clarify  certain\r\n\r\npoints  on  which there has been, sometimes,  in  the\r\n\r\npast,  vexatious  obscurity  and  which  has  led  to\r\n\r\nuncertainty, and a more precise definition is for the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the architects' clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Schedule, which is perhaps more\r\n\r\ninteresting  to  the ordinary man,  introduces  three\r\n\r\nvaluable changes. The first is the principle of  what\r\n\r\nis  called quantum meruit which should now be applied\r\n\r\nspecifically  when  friendly  relations  between  the\r\n\r\narchitect  and the client are broken off  before  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  is  completed.  The  principle  of  quantum\r\n\r\nmeruit  means, broadly, that the architect gets  fees\r\n\r\ncalculated on the work which is actually done and not\r\n\r\non  the  ultimate  cost,  whether  it  is  actual  or\r\n\r\nestimated,  of  the  completed building.  The  second\r\n\r\nprovision is that the architects who are building low-cost  housing below $15,000 a unit need not be  bound\r\n\r\nby  this  scale of fees and can negotiate with  their\r\n\r\nclients any fee they like, presumably a lower fee for\r\n\r\nsimple  repetitive work. The client and the architect\r\n\r\ncan,   therefore,  get  together  and  work  out   an\r\n\r\nappropriate  fee for a mass-production  type  of  job\r\n\r\nand,  following from this, the former  sliding  scale\r\n\r\nwhich  ranged from 10 per cent to 7\ufffd per cent of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  value  of the work done is now replaced  by  a\r\n\r\nfixed rate of 7\ufffd per cent. These three\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsignificant   adjustments   undoubtedly    constitute\r\n\r\nimprovements over the 1932 Schedule and I think  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  will  probably support  them.

These  two\r\n\r\nlanding places are: one at Hylam Kongsi and the other\r\n\r\nat  Clyde Terrace, and the need to close them down is\r\n\r\nbecause there is a letter from the President  of  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  stating that work on the coastal  road\r\n\r\nhas  been  hampered because of loading and  unloading\r\n\r\nfrom small craft along these landing places.
