George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Honourable Members will recollect\r\n\r\nthat during the debate on the motion moved by  the\r\n\r\nthen Member for Hong Lim inviting, inter alia, the\r\n\r\nAssembly  to rescind my ruling which admitted  the\r\n\r\nmotion of the Deputy Prime Minister to condemn and\r\n\r\nto  suspend  the  then Member  for  Hong  Lim  for\r\n\r\nalleged dishonourable conduct in the Assembly,  I,\r\n\r\nin  effect,  opined  that  the  issue  before  the\r\n\r\nAssembly seemed to have been confused and  clouded\r\n\r\nand I wondered whether, in view of the conflicting\r\n\r\nopinions  that  had  been  expressed  during   the\r\n\r\ndebate,  it would not be in the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  to  obtain  legal opinion  in  the  matter.\r\n\r\nHonourable Members will recollect that the  motion\r\n\r\nwas  taken  to  a division and was defeated  by  a\r\n\r\nmajority vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there was no unanimity and as the issue raised\r\n\r\nwas,  to my mind, one of utmost importance in  the\r\n\r\norderly and proper conduct of the business of this\r\n\r\nAssembly, allowing of no doubts, especially in the\r\n\r\nmind  of  the Speaker, I prepared a memorandum  on\r\n\r\nthe  matter  and requested the Clerk  to  seek  an\r\n\r\nopinion thereon from the Fourth Clerk-at-the-Table\r\n\r\nin  the House of Commons-a senior officer of  that\r\n\r\nHouse  primarily  charged with the  special  duty,\r\n\r\nwhen asked, of assisting and advising legislatures\r\n\r\nin  the Commonwealth on matters referred to him by\r\n\r\nthe Clerks of such legislatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reply has been received and it would, I think,\r\n\r\nbe of interest to place on record the views of the\r\n\r\nFourth  Clerk-at-the-Table on the specific  points\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion by the then Member for Hong Lim was\r\n\r\nin the following terms:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the ruling of the Speaker admitting the\r\n\r\nmotion of the Deputy Prime Minister in regard to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Hong Lim be rescinded and that this\r\n\r\nAssembly has no jurisdiction to deal with the\r\n\r\nmatters raised therein.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stated in my memorandum that the arguments put\r\n\r\nforward  in  the debate in favour  of  the  motion\r\n\r\nurged, in effect-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that the Assembly had no power either to\r\n\r\ncondemn  or to suspend the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim in the circumstances of the case and in\r\n\r\nthe   light   of  the  constitutional   and\r\n\r\nstatutory provisions extant in Singapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that, therefore, the motion of the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  sought  to  request   the\r\n\r\nAssembly  to do something which  was  ultra\r\n\r\nvires;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that, consequently, the Speaker ought to\r\n\r\nhave ruled that the notice of the motion of\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy Prime Minister was inadmissible\r\n\r\nand  the  motion  could  not  therefore  be\r\n\r\nplaced on the Order Paper for debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions I posed were as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Is the Speaker justified, under the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 31(5)  and\r\n\r\nhaving   regard  to  section  54   of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore (Constitution) Order in  Council,\r\n\r\n1958, to direct that a notice of motion  be\r\n\r\nreturned  if he is of the opinion that,  or\r\n\r\nentertains  some doubt whether, the  motion\r\n\r\nseeks   to  request  the  Assembly  to   do\r\n\r\nsomething which is ultra vires?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In the light of the inherent powers of the\r\n\r\nAssembly,   and  the  provisions   of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore (Constitution) Order in  Council,\r\n\r\n1958,   the   Standing   Orders   and   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly (Power and Privileges)\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1955:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly: Has the Assembly power to proceed\r\n\r\nagainst  a  Member by way of condemnation  (or\r\n\r\ncensure,  reprimand  or  admonition)  in   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances enunciated in the motion of  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly: Has the Assembly power to suspend a\r\n\r\nMember  for dishonourable conduct of the nature\r\n\r\nalleged  in  the  motion of  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister: and if so, to what extent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference is made in question (a) to paragraph\r\n\r\n(5) of Standing Order No. 31 and to section 54  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  (Constitution) Order  in  Council,\r\n\r\n1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order No. 31 deals, inter alia, with the\r\n\r\nmanner of giving notices of motions and paragraph\r\n\r\n(5) thereof reads as follows :-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(5) Any such notice shall be submitted to the\r\n\r\nSpeaker or in his absence the Deputy Speaker  who\r\n\r\nshall direct-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that it be printed in the terms in which it\r\n\r\nwas handed in; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that it be printed with such alterations as\r\n\r\nhe may direct; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that it he returned to the Member who\r\n\r\nsigned it, as being in his opinion\r\n\r\ninadmissible for reasons stated.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1) of section 54 of the Order in\r\n\r\nCouncil reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Subject to the provisions of this Order and\r\n\r\nof the Standing Orders of the Assembly, any Member\r\n\r\nmay  introduce any Bill or propose any motion  for\r\n\r\ndebate  in,  or may present any petition  to,  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  and  the  same  shall  be  debated  and\r\n\r\ndisposed  of according to the Standing  Orders  of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Paragraph (2) of that section specifies  when  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  must\r\n\r\nbe signified before the Assembly can proceed inter\r\n\r\nalia upon any motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On question (a), the Fourth Clerk-at-the-Table\r\n\r\nhad, inter alia, this to say-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the Speaker would not be justified in\r\n\r\ndirecting  that  a notice of motion  be  returned.\r\n\r\neven if he is of the opinion that the motion seeks\r\n\r\nto  request the Assembly to do something which  is\r\n\r\nultra  vires. He has in my view no right or status\r\n\r\nto  prejudge the issue in this way; it is for  the\r\n\r\nAssembly to decide.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fourth Clerk-at-the-Table goes on to make two\r\n\r\nfurther points, namely:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(i) To the best of my knowledge no Speaker of\r\n\r\nthe  House  of  Commons has ever  ruled  out  of\r\n\r\norder  a notice of motion on the ground that  it\r\n\r\nsuggested  a  course of action which  was  ultra\r\n\r\nvires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Section 54 of the Constitution Order in\r\n\r\nCouncil puts the matter fairly clearly. If a\r\n\r\nmotion   does   not   conflict   with    the\r\n\r\nconstitution  itself or  with  the  Standing\r\n\r\nOrders (which it does not appear to do)  and\r\n\r\nif  it does not impose a charge, etc. (which\r\n\r\nit does not), it may be moved.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first part of question (b), that is to\r\n\r\nsay,  whether  the Assembly has power  to  proceed\r\n\r\nagainst  a  Member  by  way  of  condemnation  (or\r\n\r\ncensure,  reprimand  or admonition),  the  Fourth\r\n\r\nClerk-at-the-Table states that he would be  fairly\r\n\r\ncertainly  of  the opinion that the Assembly  does\r\n\r\nhave such power. He adds-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There seems to be nothing indeed to prevent any\r\n\r\ndeliberative body (such as for example the Council\r\n\r\nof  a  Trade Union) doing this, provided that  the\r\n\r\nmotion  does not contain a libel.

This\r\n\r\nwould  be  so  even  if, as suggested  during  the\r\n\r\ndebate,  the  Assembly had sought  and  agreed  to\r\n\r\nabide   by   the   opinion   of   so   eminent   a\r\n\r\nconstitutional  lawyer as Sir Ivor  Jennings;  but\r\n\r\nthe  fact that the Assembly acted on that  opinion\r\n\r\nwould   not   in  itself  persuade  the   Judicial\r\n\r\nCommittee  of the Privy Council if the issue  came\r\n\r\nbefore  them that the Assembly's action must  have\r\n\r\nbeen  intra  vires.

The other\r\n\r\nis  that the Housing and Development Board should,\r\n\r\nwhen  building its houses, take into consideration\r\n\r\nthe  Malay sector of the population involved in  a\r\n\r\nparticular  area  and include and  integrate  them\r\n\r\ninto a building estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first school of thought has considerable\r\n\r\nargument on its side in the case of special  rural\r\n\r\nareas  where  the  Housing and  Development  Board\r\n\r\nprojects  are  not so intensive, and  considerable\r\n\r\nwork  can  be  done to improve housing  conditions\r\n\r\namong  the  Malays  in the kampongs.  But  in  the\r\n\r\nsuburban areas where all housing development and a\r\n\r\nconsiderable number of these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplans  have  been  drawn up  by  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board, it is considered unhealthy  to\r\n\r\nsegregate  deliberately the community  by  marking\r\n\r\nout  certain  buildings as only for occupation  by\r\n\r\nMalays.  The balance of opinion is that where  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  is  already  a  mixed  one   and   when\r\n\r\nresettlement takes place, it should take place  on\r\n\r\na \"mixed\" basis\u2014mixed in the sense that no special\r\n\r\nroads or particular buildings are set aside for  a\r\n\r\nparticular   race.  Therefore,  the  question   of\r\n\r\nspecial mosques to accompany these houses in these\r\n\r\nhousing  and  development  plans  does  not  arise \r\n\r\n- neither churches nor temples. In the case of  the\r\n\r\nkampong  settlements, there is procedure  for  the\r\n\r\nkampong  dwellers to make application for a  surau\r\n\r\nto be set up by the appropriate District Office.\r\n\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SHIPS PREVIOUSLY REGISTERED IN SINGAPORE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Transfer of registration elsewhere and tonnages involved)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

The  existing law relating to  gaming  in\r\n\r\npublic is contained in the Vagrancy Ordinance, and\r\n\r\nhas  been  found  to  be very  inadequate.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore proposed, Sir, following the legislation\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation  of  Malaya,  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  relating to gaming in  public  in  the\r\n\r\nCommon Gaming Houses Ordinance, and to give  wider\r\n\r\npowers to the police to suppress gaming in public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many complaints of the noise and\r\n\r\nnuisance  caused  by gaming in  coffee  shops  and\r\n\r\nplaces of public resort, and it is known that such\r\n\r\nplaces are frequented by secret society members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides, in clause 7, for the\r\n\r\npunishment  of  gaming  in  public  and  for   the\r\n\r\npunishment  of persons who instigate,  promote  or\r\n\r\nintentionally  facilitate the  commission  of  the\r\n\r\noffence of gaming in public. A person who  is  the\r\n\r\ntenant,  lessee, occupier or person in  charge  of\r\n\r\nany  public place which is used for gaming is also\r\n\r\nmade  liable to punishment, unless he proves  that\r\n\r\nhe has no knowledge that the premises are used for\r\n\r\ngaming. In order to facilitate proofs of gaming in\r\n\r\npublic,  a  number  of presumptions  are  created.\r\n\r\nWhere  it  is shown that the person was playing  a\r\n\r\ngame  of  chance or any mixed game of  chance  and\r\n\r\nskill in a public place, it will be presumed until\r\n\r\nthe contrary is proved that he was gaming, that he\r\n\r\nwas  playing for money or money's worth.

Eight months\r\n\r\nago in this House, during the debate on the Common\r\n\r\nGaming   Houses  (Amendment)  Bill,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nclaimed twice that he had enough powers under that\r\n\r\nBill to be able to do what he intended to do.  Let\r\n\r\nme  quote, Sir, from Hansard, Volume 12,  No.  11,\r\n\r\ncol. 723, line 12:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have looked very closely into the Common\r\n\r\nGaming  Houses  Ordinance, and we  find  that  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  there are sufficient for  us  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith the situation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And again in col. 727, line 9, the Minister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have all the powers that we want. No\r\n\r\nadditional powers are necessary. All that we  have\r\n\r\nto do is to go for them and bring them down.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the  fact that today he is asking  for  more\r\n\r\npowers  shows  that the problem is more  difficult\r\n\r\nthan was anticipated.

Since  the  Government\r\n\r\nmaintain that they too regard gambling as a social\r\n\r\nevil\u2014their purpose is not to increase the  revenue\r\n\r\nbut  to  control the evil\u2014may I suggest  something\r\n\r\nquite  constructive, Sir, and if  they  adopt  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion, it will be a proof of their sincerity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that to control gambling adequately as\r\n\r\na  social  evil, there must also be an educational\r\n\r\ncampaign. The Ministry of Culture and the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education  have  in their  hands  the  weapons \r\n\r\n\u2014 propaganda and education \u2014 to enable the people to\r\n\r\nrealise  that  gambling is an evil, and  that  the\r\n\r\npoor  mugs  who buy those tickets will  simply  be\r\n\r\ncontributing out of their hard-earned earnings  to\r\n\r\nthe coffers of the promoters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the workers in Singapore are made to realise\r\n\r\nthis,  Sir,  then  it  will gradually  reduce  the\r\n\r\ngambling  evil  in  Singapore.  We  will   be   in\r\n\r\nwholehearted  support of their  attempt.  We  will\r\n\r\nthen  say  that the Government are really  sincere\r\n\r\nand  that  their motive is really not to  increase\r\n\r\nrevenue. Sir, we are only too pleased to agree  to\r\n\r\nthe   granting   of  additional  powers   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are glad\r\n\r\nthat the Government have now come to this Assembly\r\n\r\nfor additional powers to control gambling. But the\r\n\r\nGovernment \u2014 and a P.A.P. Government at that  \u2014 have\r\n\r\nbeen wont to say in this Assembly and outside that\r\n\r\nthey  always say what they mean and mean what they\r\n\r\nsay.  They said not so long ago, as quoted by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin  (to  quote  the  words  from\r\n\r\nHansard, Vol. 12, No. 11, col. 723):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have looked very closely into the Common\r\n\r\nGaming  Houses  Ordinance, and we  find  that  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  there are sufficient for  us  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith the situation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>They  always say what they mean. But the  Minister\r\n\r\nnow  comes  to this House and says that what  they\r\n\r\nmeant to say was that what they said was not  what\r\n\r\nthey meant to say at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they said they were keen to control\r\n\r\ngambling.  We are with them in that. But  we  must\r\n\r\nsay this: that instead of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrolling gambling, they had, because  of  their\r\n\r\nspecial  liking  for  the  Singapore  Turf   Club,\r\n\r\nencouraged the opening of shops along the  streets\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  with signboards saying,  \"Singapore\r\n\r\nTurf  Club Tickets Sold Here\". And we said at that\r\n\r\ntime that if the Government were to introduce this\r\n\r\nkind   of  public  lottery,  it  would  mean  more\r\n\r\ngambling;   it   would  mean  encouraging   school\r\n\r\nchildren  to walk into a shop to buy a ticket  for\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is in danger\r\n\r\nof going back to the old debate on that particular\r\n\r\ntopic.  Can he indicate how his remarks arise  out\r\n\r\nof this particular Bill? We are now discussing the\r\n\r\nprinciple of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, what the\r\n\r\nGovernment intends to do with this Bill is to  see\r\n\r\nthat  gambling is more controlled.  But  the  very\r\n\r\nfact  that there are more retailers now of  public\r\n\r\nlotteries means that gambling is not so controlled\r\n\r\nas the Government want it to be. That is why I try\r\n\r\nto  point  out that on the one hand they  say  one\r\n\r\nthing,  but  on  the other hand, they  do  another\r\n\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there is a\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding by the Members of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nof  what this Bill sets out to do. The Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park has not said anything today, probably\r\n\r\nbecause he realises the legal position better than\r\n\r\nhis colleagues on the Front Bench!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to provide for more\r\n\r\neffective control of common gaming houses,  public\r\n\r\nlotteries, as well as public gaming. In the  past,\r\n\r\nthe  Common  Gaming  Houses Ordinance  dealt  with\r\n\r\ncommon  gaming houses and public lotteries.  There\r\n\r\nwas  a  separate Ordinance known as  the  Vagrancy\r\n\r\nOrdinance  which  dealt with  public  gaming.  The\r\n\r\npurpose of this Bill is to repeal those provisions\r\n\r\nof  the Vagrancy Ordinance which dealt with public\r\n\r\ngaming,  and to bring those provisions within  the\r\n\r\nscope  of  the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance.  In\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of  Malaya, Mr  Speaker,  public\r\n\r\ngaming, common gaming houses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  public lotteries are punished under a  single\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   and   we  have,   in   making   these\r\n\r\namendments, adopted the same procedure here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tanglin has just\r\n\r\nnow made a very novel suggestion to the House.  He\r\n\r\nhas  suggested  that,  in order  to  bring  public\r\n\r\ngaming  and gambling generally under control,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  try to educate  gamblers.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I think the best way to  deal  with\r\n\r\ngamblers  is to increase effectively the penalties\r\n\r\nof  the law so as to make it not worth their while\r\n\r\nto  continue those pursuits. Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\npenalties  for gaming in public have been  equated\r\n\r\nwith  the  penalties provided for  other  offences\r\n\r\nunder  the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance in  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Turf Club recently\r\n\r\npublished its Annual Report on the proceedings  of\r\n\r\nthe  past  year.  It  was clearly  shown  in  that\r\n\r\nReport, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the amount of money\r\n\r\ninvested  on the totalisator operated by the  Club\r\n\r\nincreased from $13 million in 1959 to $23  million\r\n\r\nin  1960. It was also stated in that Report  that,\r\n\r\nas  a  result  of steps taken by the Club  in \r\n\r\nco-operation  with the police, about 1,000  to  1,500\r\n\r\nbookmakers  were put out of action.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, that is indeed a creditable performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill has\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  far from bringing gambling  under\r\n\r\ncontrol, we have allowed the Turf Club to  try  to\r\n\r\ninduce  members  of the public to gamble.  He  has\r\n\r\nreferred  to the notice boards that are placed  in\r\n\r\nshops by the Turf Club, inviting the public to buy\r\n\r\nlottery  tickets  there. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact,  the Turf Club  have  been  very\r\n\r\ndisappointed in their expectations. In fact, there\r\n\r\nhas  not  been  an increase in the sale  of  their\r\n\r\nlottery tickets. The people who are interested  in\r\n\r\nthat sort of gaming already had the facilities  of\r\n\r\nbuying  these  tickets. It  has  not  in  any  way\r\n\r\nincreased public gaming. So that all in  all,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, together with the action  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen taken in the past, this Bill will be able  to\r\n\r\nbring  gaming  under proper control,  particularly\r\n\r\ngaming  in  public, for which the punishments  are\r\n\r\ntotally  inadequate  under  the  present  Vagrancy\r\n\r\nOrdinance.

A good many people may  not  want  to\r\n\r\nlive  in  a Utopia. The other point is this.  What\r\n\r\nthe  Government may consider to be a good  or  bad\r\n\r\nthing  may  not  meet with the thinking  of  other\r\n\r\npeople.  After all, to grow pretty roses  we  also\r\n\r\nneed cow-dung.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Labour and Law\r\n\r\nhas  stressed the public aspect of gaming. I agree\r\n\r\nwith   him   that  gaming  in  public  should   be\r\n\r\nsuppressed. By all means do so. But the definition\r\n\r\n\"gaming\"   in  clause  2  when  taken   with   the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of \"common gaming house\" in  the  same\r\n\r\nclause makes habitual gaming in private clubs open\r\n\r\nto  prosecution. Mr Speaker, Sir, the  definition\r\n\r\nof  \"common  gaming  house\" \u2014 the  second  part  of\r\n\r\nit\u2014reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`any place kept for habitual gaming, whether the\r\n\r\npublic or any class of the public has or may  have\r\n\r\naccess thereto or not,'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat brings in private clubs where habitual gaming\r\n\r\ntakes place. I think I am right there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` \"gaming\", with its grammatical variations and\r\n\r\ncognate expressions, means the playing of any game\r\n\r\nof  chance or of mixed chance and skill for  money\r\n\r\nor money's worth;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br> If  you go to clause (2) (b), the Minister\u2014I take\r\n\r\nit he will be Minister for Labour and Law\u2014may:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`declare any game, method, device, scheme or\r\n\r\ncompetition specified ... to be a game  of  chance\r\n\r\nor  a  mixed  game  of chance and  skill  ... and\r\n\r\nthereupon  it shall be an irrebuttable presumption\r\n\r\nof  law that such game, [etc.] is a game of chance\r\n\r\n.... as the case may be, for the purposes of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There can be no defence then if, for instance,  in\r\n\r\na private club there is habitually going on a game\r\n\r\nwhich  the Minister by notification in the Gazette\r\n\r\ndeclares to be a game within the Ordinance.  There\r\n\r\nis  no  defence at all. Now, there is a game which\r\n\r\ngoes on not only in every private club but also in\r\n\r\nthe  majority of Chinese private houses,  not  for\r\n\r\none  day  or for two days in a year, but  probably\r\n\r\nfor  300 or more days in a year, and that game  is\r\n\r\nmahjong.  Mahjong to the Chinese is what the  game\r\n\r\nof  bridge or whist is to the Europeans. There  is\r\n\r\nno  question  whatsoever  that  mahjong  has  some\r\n\r\nelement of chance. I do not deny that. But it is a\r\n\r\nnational  game, and if the definition in clause  2\r\n\r\nis  carried  to  its  logical  conclusion  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law, then everyone  of  us\r\n\r\nmay  land  in gaol. For that purpose, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nmay  I ask the Minister for Labour and Law to give\r\n\r\nan assurance that, before he uses his powers given\r\n\r\nin  clause  (2)  (b), he will  have  a  full-dress\r\n\r\ndebate  in this House?

The Sale of Food  and\r\n\r\nDrugs Ordinance provides for the sale of food  and\r\n\r\ndrugs  in  a  pure  state and for  such  necessary\r\n\r\ncontrols    over    the    import,    manufacture,\r\n\r\ndistribution and sale of food and drugs,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  public are protected and can obtain  articles\r\n\r\nof a high quality and composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal Regulations under this - Ordinance\r\n\r\nwere  published in 1957, and, the past  3\u00bd  years'\r\n\r\nexperience in applying them has shown the need  to\r\n\r\nimprove  and  to  add  to  the  1957  Regulations.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  changes  in  food technology  occurring\r\n\r\nduring this time have brought forth new substances\r\n\r\nand    techniques   which   were   not   permitted\r\n\r\npreviously,  but  which can now be  advantageously\r\n\r\npermitted under prescribed conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regulations before you, Sir, refer\r\n\r\nparticularly  to three aspects of food  and  drugs\r\n\r\ncontrol.  Firstly, various provisions  now  permit\r\n\r\nthe  addition  of Vitamins A and  D  to  milk  and\r\n\r\nprescribe  adequate standards for such enrichment.\r\n\r\nEmulsifiers  are  now permitted  in  milks  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of advances in food technology. Half-cream\r\n\r\nand  vitaminised  skimmed milk are  now  permitted\r\n\r\nfree  sale under prescribed standards. Regulations\r\n\r\n2, 3, and 4 have reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, hitherto certain colouring matters were\r\n\r\nprescribed as prohibited colouring matters, and in\r\n\r\nthis  context  all  other colouring  matters  were\r\n\r\npermitted.  In  accordance with current  practice,\r\n\r\nthese  have  been revised and a list of  permitted\r\n\r\ncolouring  matters  has  been  drawn  up,  thereby\r\n\r\nexcluding all other colouring matters. The  object\r\n\r\nof  this  amendment is to ensure  that  newer  and\r\n\r\npossibly  dangerous  and toxic  colouring  matters\r\n\r\ndeveloped as a result of advances in the  chemical\r\n\r\nfield do not become freely used. Regulations 5 and\r\n\r\n6 and Schedule A have reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in the principal Regulations,\r\n\r\nanti-oxidants  or  substances which  prevent  or  delay\r\n\r\nrancidity  were not defined but were  left  to  be\r\n\r\napproved individually by the Chief Chemist. It  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  that generally accepted  anti-oxidants\r\n\r\nshould  be  specifically  defined  and  these  now\r\n\r\nappear  in Schedule H of the amending Regulations,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  type of anti-oxidant and the permitted\r\n\r\nquantity are defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these changes, the opportunity was taken\r\n\r\nto  do away with the complex set of forms shown in\r\n\r\nSchedule  C of the principal Regulations,  and  to\r\n\r\nreplace  them  by  a simpler and  more  convenient\r\n\r\nsingle  form to be issued administratively by  the\r\n\r\nMinister. In short, these Regulations will broaden\r\n\r\nthe  controls on milk, colouring matters and \r\n\r\nanti-oxidants  in  the  light of current  practice  and\r\n\r\nimprove our Food and Drugs Control laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (3) of\r\n\r\nsection 28 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Chapter  148), resolves that the Food  and  Drugs\r\n\r\n(Amendment)   Regulations,  1961,   published   as\r\n\r\nNotification  No.  S 36 in the Gazette  Supplement\r\n\r\nNo. 12 of the 10th February, 1961, as contained in\r\n\r\nPaper S.L. 3 of 1961, be approved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ALGERIA</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

The warmth of the welcome given  to\r\n\r\nhim  was  a measure of the admiration and sympathy\r\n\r\nour  people had for the Algerians in their  bitter\r\n\r\nstruggle  against  a tenacious  and  unenlightened\r\n\r\nFrench  colonialism. This sympathy for nationalist\r\n\r\nstruggles  everywhere comes naturally  to  peoples\r\n\r\nwho  for  decades have tasted the  humiliation  of\r\n\r\nalien   rule   and   arrogant  despotism.   Though\r\n\r\nSingapore  is not in a position to involve  itself\r\n\r\nactively in foreign affairs, it nevertheless  took\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to pay its respects to the leader\r\n\r\nof the Algerian freedom fighters the moment he set\r\n\r\nfoot on Singapore soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French, with characteristic obtuseness,\r\n\r\nappear  to  have taken a dim view of  the  welcome\r\n\r\naccorded  by Singapore to Dr Abbas. They  thought\r\n\r\nit  necessary  to make a protest  to  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment over this. The British, for their part,\r\n\r\nnot  only transmitted this silly protest to us but\r\n\r\nalso  saw  fit,  presumably out  of  deference  to\r\n\r\nFrench  sensitivity,  to deprecate  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment for having accorded the honours  to  an\r\n\r\nenemy of French imperialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Western reaction to the welcome accorded to\r\n\r\nDr Ferhat Abbas is typical of their insensitivity\r\n\r\nto  the  winds  of  change in Africa  and  to  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of  the Asian peoples to the  liberation\r\n\r\nstruggles  now erupting from one end of Africa  to\r\n\r\nthe other. What the Western powers have failed  to\r\n\r\ngrasp   is  that  Africa  has  joined  the  global\r\n\r\nrevolution  of rising expectations and  that  this\r\n\r\nlong   quiescent   continent   is   entering   the\r\n\r\nmainstream of man's quest for human dignity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French, in particular, appear not to have\r\n\r\nlearnt the lessons of their ignominious defeat  in\r\n\r\nwhat  used to be known as French Indo-China.  Like\r\n\r\nKing  Canute, they thought they could  order  back\r\n\r\nthe rising tide of nationalism in Indo-China. They\r\n\r\ntried  to  erect a dyke of repression against  the\r\n\r\ntidal wave of nationalist revolt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in the end, the dyke broke and\r\n\r\nFrench colonialism was swept into the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in Algeria, the French imperialists are\r\n\r\nrepeating the errors they made in Indo-China.  The\r\n\r\nonly difference is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat in Algeria they are practising repression  on\r\n\r\na  scale  that  far exceeds in brutality  anything\r\n\r\ncarried   out  in  Indo-China.  If  the   Algerian\r\n\r\nstruggle   for   freedom  has  won   the   special\r\n\r\nadmiration  of peoples in Asia and Africa  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen because of the Algerians' refusal to be cowed\r\n\r\nand  broken by the terrorism unleashed  by  French\r\n\r\ncolons   and   by   disgruntled  French   generals\r\n\r\nevacuated from the battlefields of Indo-china. The\r\n\r\nsystematic  and  widespread  torture  of  Algerian\r\n\r\nnationalists  has been testified to  not  only  by\r\n\r\nFrench liberals and intellectuals but also by  the\r\n\r\nInternational Red Cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savagery of imperialist repression in Algeria\r\n\r\nderives  from the determination of just  over  one\r\n\r\nmillion European colons to remain permanently  the\r\n\r\noverlords of some nine million Arabs. The six-year\r\n\r\nold war in Algeria is essentially an attempt by  a\r\n\r\nFascist-minded  minority of European  settlers  to\r\n\r\nensure  the  permanent  subjugation  of  the  Arab\r\n\r\nmajority  whose  proper  role,  according  to  the\r\n\r\nFrench  colons, is to serve as hewers of wood  and\r\n\r\ndrawers of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the situation in Algeria is not\r\n\r\nunlike that prevailing in Kenya, South Africa  and\r\n\r\nother areas where European minorities have settled\r\n\r\namong  a non-European population. In Algeria,  the\r\n\r\nEuropean  colons  steadfastly  refuse  to  abandon\r\n\r\ntheir   position  of  a  privileged   aristocracy.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  when confronted by the  assertions  of\r\n\r\nAlgerian  nationalism  and  Algerian  demands  for\r\n\r\nfreedom,  the  French  colons,  backed  by  French\r\n\r\ngenerals,   are   trying   to   counter   Algerian\r\n\r\nnationalism with repression and terror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was French extremism which forced a moderate\r\n\r\nand  conciliatory Algerian nationalism  to  resist\r\n\r\nFrench  repression and violence with  violence  of\r\n\r\nits own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ferhat Abbas, for example, is no extremist. He was initially an advocate of an Algerian\r\n\r\nRepublic  federally linked to France. This  modest\r\n\r\ndemand  was rejected by the French Government  out\r\n\r\nof deference to the stiff-necked colons and French\r\n\r\ngenerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French answer to the Arab demand for\r\n\r\nprogressive  devolution of power to the  Algerians\r\n\r\nwas  force  and  repression. Today,  some  half  a\r\n\r\nmillion  French  troops are  engaged  in  what  is\r\n\r\neuphemistically   termed  the  \"pacification\"   of\r\n\r\nAlgeria. Until a few months ago, the French  tried\r\n\r\nto dismiss the Algerian National Liberation Front,\r\n\r\nled  by  Dr Abbas, as an insignificant  group  of\r\n\r\nmalcontents   who   in  no   way   reflected   the\r\n\r\naspirations  of  the nine million  Algerians.  The\r\n\r\nEuropean  settlers comforted themselves  with  the\r\n\r\nbelief  that the Arab masses enjoyed being  slaves\r\n\r\nin their own country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this myth was exploded last December\r\n\r\nwhen  General de Gaulle visited Algeria.  European\r\n\r\nsettlers tried to force Arabs to take part in  the\r\n\r\ngeneral strike to demonstrate support for a French\r\n\r\nAlgeria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arab masses, who had hitherto remained silent\r\n\r\nand  sullen  under European terror, gave  vent  to\r\n\r\ntheir   feelings  by  raising  the  cry  of  \"Arab\r\n\r\nAlgeria\".  Green  and white flags  of  the  F.L.N.\r\n\r\nappeared  out of nowhere by the thousands  in  all\r\n\r\nthe major cities of Algeria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the myth that the F.L.N. represented only a\r\n\r\nminority of Arabs was decisively exploded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no doubt now that the Arab masses\r\n\r\nhave clearly identified themselves with the F.L.N.\r\n\r\nand  with  Dr  Ferhat Abbas.  French  terror  and\r\n\r\nrepression  will  not halt the march  of  Algerian\r\n\r\nindependence. The war in Algeria has  entered  the\r\n\r\nlast  phase which must culminate in the demise  of\r\n\r\nFrench  imperialism. It may be that the  desperate\r\n\r\nFrench  colons  and generals will  be  tempted  to\r\n\r\nlaunch  all-out repression and total  war  in  the\r\n\r\nhope  of  prolonging their uneasy hold for  a  few\r\n\r\nmore  years.  But  as in Indo-China,  the  French\r\n\r\nCanutes must retreat before the irresistible force\r\n\r\nof nationalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World opinion and, in particular, Afro-Asian\r\n\r\nopinion,   can   hasten  the  demise   of   French\r\n\r\ncolonialism  in Algeria by showing their  sympathy\r\n\r\nfor the Algerians and by pressing for a negotiated\r\n\r\nsettlement between the French\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the F.L.N.

The only force worth negotiating with is  the\r\n\r\nF.L.N. headed  by  Dr Abbas,  because  only  the\r\n\r\nF.L.N. has  the support of the vast  majority  of\r\n\r\nAlgerians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dr Abbas was in Singapore, he gave this\r\n\r\nparting message to the people of Singapore:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`From all of you we ask not arms but support and\r\n\r\npressure  on  France to end this war  against  our\r\n\r\npeople. We are confident of your help.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is in no position to offer massive help\r\n\r\nto  the  courageous people of Algeria. But we  can\r\n\r\nrespond  to  the request of Dr Abbas and  sustain\r\n\r\nthe  spirit of the Algerian nationalists by  token\r\n\r\nsympathy and support. I therefore propose  that  a\r\n\r\nsum  of  $10,000 be contributed by the  Government\r\n\r\ntowards  an  \"Aid to Algeria Fund\". The Government\r\n\r\nis  confident that members of the public will  add\r\n\r\nto  this  fund  by  contributions  of  their  own.\r\n\r\nContributions  can be sent addressed  to  \"Aid  to\r\n\r\nAlgeria  Fund\", the Prime Minister's Office,  City\r\n\r\nHall.

The  majority of  the  population  in\r\n\r\nAlgeria  are  Moslems. To all outward appearances,\r\n\r\nit would appear that this is a war between Moslems\r\n\r\nand non-Moslems, between Moslems and Christians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Dr Abbas, in a Press interview at the\r\n\r\nAirport,  quite  categorically  stated  - that  the\r\n\r\nF.L.N.  (Force Liberation Nationale) is not waging\r\n\r\na  holy  war. It is not a war between the  Moslems\r\n\r\nand the Christians. The F.L.N. is not waging a war\r\n\r\nbetween  race  and  race, between  Algerians  and\r\n\r\nFrench,  between brown and coloured people against\r\n\r\nwhite.  It  is  essentially  a  war  against   the\r\n\r\ndomination  of  a European power over  an  African\r\n\r\nState.  In  this, we whole-heartedly  support  the\r\n\r\ncause of the F.L.N.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the F.L.N. was formed, there was no\r\n\r\norganisation   in   Algeria   to   fight    French\r\n\r\ncolonialism. The Moslems in Algeria, including the\r\n\r\nrefugees,    are   whole-heartedly   behind    the\r\n\r\nleadership  of  Ferhat Abbas,  who  is  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of the pro-tem Algerian Government.  The\r\n\r\nmotion  that  we  are moving, that the  Government\r\n\r\nshould contribute $10,000 towards the cause of the\r\n\r\nAlgerian  people, should rightly  be  given  to  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative body, a body that has obtained  the\r\n\r\nrecognition  of  those  who are  fighting  against\r\n\r\nFrench    colonialism.   That   money,   including\r\n\r\ncontributions from the public, should be delivered\r\n\r\nto  the Provisional Government of Algeria. And  if\r\n\r\nthis  pro-tem Algerian Government  so  wishes  to\r\n\r\ndonate  this sum to the relief of their  refugees,\r\n\r\nthen  we cannot stop them. But we would say  this:\r\n\r\nthat the Provisional Government under Ferhat Abbas\r\n\r\nis  the  representative body of  the  Moslems  in\r\n\r\nAlgeria, and it is quite correct, therefore,  that\r\n\r\nany  assistance towards their fight against French\r\n\r\ncolonialism  should  be given to  this  particular\r\n\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I therefore oppose the amendment moved by the Member for Cairnhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I just add to the\r\n\r\nexplanation,  Mr  Speaker, Sir?  If  we  were  in\r\n\r\ndiplomatic    relationship   with    the    French\r\n\r\nGovernment, then perhaps it may be necessary,  for\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  and  other  considerations,  and   the\r\n\r\nniceties  of  international intercourse,  to  give\r\n\r\nthis  sum  of money in such a way as not to  upset\r\n\r\nthe diplomatic relations between us and France.  I\r\n\r\nthink  Members  of the House have heard  what  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture had to say  about  what  we\r\n\r\nthink  of  the  French protests  and  the  British\r\n\r\ndeprecation  of our reception to Dr Abbas.  These\r\n\r\nconsiderations do not bear on our action  at  all.\r\n\r\nWe  give  this  money in support of  the  Algerian\r\n\r\npeople's  struggle for freedom. In the process  of\r\n\r\nthat  struggle, there have been many displacements\r\n\r\nof  persons.  If it is the view of the Provisional\r\n\r\nGovernment  to use the money for the refugees,  so\r\n\r\nbe  it.  But  why  do we want to  specify  to  the\r\n\r\nProvisional Government of Algeria that  they  must\r\n\r\nuse  it  for  the refugees? Dr Abbas has  already\r\n\r\nsaid that he wants our moral support. He does  not\r\n\r\nwant  arms  from us. So we can be sure  that  this\r\n\r\n$10,000 will not be for the purchase of French \r\n\r\nsub-machine guns. It must be used in a manner which we\r\n\r\nthink  they are fit to decide. Therefore, I -think\r\n\r\nthe  amendment is really of no significance. There\r\n\r\nis  no  reason why we should dilute our frank  and\r\n\r\nwholehearted  admiration for  their  struggle  for\r\n\r\nfreedom.  If  the Member for Cairnhill  wishes  to\r\n\r\nmove  another motion at some other date expressing\r\n\r\nhis  sympathy  and his feelings of depression  and\r\n\r\nmelancholia  at the thought of refugees  suffering\r\n\r\nas  a  result of their being displaced from  their\r\n\r\nhomes, we will be quite ready to support him then.\r\n\r\nBut I say that this $10,000 is not a very big sum.\r\n\r\nLet  us not quibble about what it should be given\r\n\r\nfor. Let the Provisional Government of Algeria use\r\n\r\nit  for refugees or for any other cause they  deem\r\n\r\nfit.

Let  us review the  history  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  leadership among the masses in attaining\r\n\r\nthe new constitution under which we operate today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955, there were the general elections under\r\n\r\nthe  Rendel  Constitution, the P.A.P. having  been\r\n\r\nformed in December of the previous year, 1954. But\r\n\r\nat that time, we fully understood the implications\r\n\r\nof the Rendel Constitution, that it did not convey\r\n\r\nin  any  sense a self-administering government  or\r\n\r\ngive  complete internal control of the affairs  of\r\n\r\nthe State. For that reason, the P.A.P. resolved to\r\n\r\nbe  in  the  Opposition during the period  of  the\r\n\r\nRendel  Constitution, so that we could reveal  the\r\n\r\nweaknesses,  the  defects, and the  sham  of  that\r\n\r\nConstitution four years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of the Rendel Constitution in\r\n\r\n1956, the first Merdeka talks were held. Mr David\r\n\r\nMarshall,  then Chief Minister, led  an  all-Party\r\n\r\ndelegation to London. Our representatives at those\r\n\r\ntalks were the Secretary-General of the Party, Mr\r\n\r\nLee  Kuan Yew, Mr Lim Ching Siong and Inche Ahmad\r\n\r\nbin   Ibrahim.  Let  me  remind  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill   that  nothing  came   out   of   those\r\n\r\nconstitutional talks under the leadership of David\r\n\r\nMarshall.  In 1957, following the resignation  and\r\n\r\ncollapse of David Marshall, Mr Lim Yew Hock,  now\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill, became Chief Minister,  and\r\n\r\nhe  in turn led a second round of talks in London.\r\n\r\nHowever,  let  us be quite honest  about  how  the\r\n\r\ntrend of those talks was carried out; who provided\r\n\r\nthe  mass base, the mass support, so that the 1957\r\n\r\ntalks  could  be successful, and  so  that  a  new\r\n\r\nConstitution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  be  drafted out which would  give  complete\r\n\r\ninternal self-government to Singapore. It  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  achievements of those \u2014 meaning the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  and  his  colleagues \u2014 who  were  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment at that time. It was an achievement  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore, of the masses,  who  had\r\n\r\nconfidence in the P.A.P. That confidence had  been\r\n\r\nvery   ably  demonstrated  in  the  City   Council\r\n\r\nelection and in the general elections in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. cannot claim that by itself it\r\n\r\nwill   lead  Singapore  to  complete  independence\r\n\r\nunless it is also supported by the masses. I  have\r\n\r\nnever  claimed  at any time that the  Constitution\r\n\r\nunder  which we operate now confers upon the State\r\n\r\ncomplete  independence. In fact, we have explained\r\n\r\nvery  carefully  and clearly  to  the  people  the\r\n\r\nlimitations  under  which  we  work  even   today.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Constitution has promised  that  in\r\n\r\n1963,  there will be a review of the Constitution,\r\n\r\nand  we are determined to see that that clause  is\r\n\r\nhonoured.  Because we have been a colony,  because\r\n\r\ntoday  we  are a semi-colony, there  is  a  mutual\r\n\r\nfeeling   of   sympathy  between  the  Provisional\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the Algerian leaders,  Dr  Ferhat\r\n\r\nAbbas and Mr Sori and ourselves. It is because  of\r\n\r\nthis understanding of peoples who have in the past\r\n\r\nbeen under colonial domination that we, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, have moved this motion in  support  of\r\n\r\nthe  Algerian  people's struggle for  independence\r\n\r\nagainst French imperialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I am a bit confused, and I am sure the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  must be also.

Sir, I am sure  all\r\n\r\nof  us  want to be free ourselves, and in  wanting\r\n\r\nfreedom  for  ourselves naturally we want  freedom\r\n\r\nfor  others also. Therefore, who is there who  can\r\n\r\noppose  or dare to oppose the granting of  freedom\r\n\r\nto  other people? We have seen that France herself\r\n\r\nin  the  course of her history has had a wonderful\r\n\r\nchapter  on her own fight for freedom.

First, this $10,000 is  a\r\n\r\ngesture - we  do not really expect it  to  help  the\r\n\r\nAlgerians   win  the  war,  not  even  if   public\r\n\r\nsubscriptions  bring  it to $100,000.  But  it  is\r\n\r\nsignificant  that in a world in  which  total  war\r\n\r\nmeans  total annihilation, the conflict is reduced\r\n\r\nto  a  secondary  plane  of  a  limited  war  with\r\n\r\nunlimited world support. There is pressure in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations. There are expressions of sympathy\r\n\r\nand  solidarity  and  we throw  in  our  voice  in\r\n\r\nsupport of the chorus on behalf of the freedom  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Algeria.  This,  of  course,  not\r\n\r\nunnaturally has made the Member for Cairnhill talk\r\n\r\nabout  independence for Singapore.  Sir,  I  think\r\n\r\nthere  should be a proper time and place in  which\r\n\r\nwe  should debate these matters. I have seen  many\r\n\r\ngyrations  and  contortions performed  by  many  a\r\n\r\npolitician in Singapore \u2014 some of them on the  Floor\r\n\r\nof   this   Assembly \u2014 but  the  gyration  and   the\r\n\r\ncontortion  and  the volte-face  that  I  saw  was\r\n\r\nsomething, Mr Speaker, Sir, which will take us  a\r\n\r\nfew   hours  of  debate.

Secondly, I have always\r\n\r\nover-ruled   the   word   \"hypocrisy\"   as   being\r\n\r\nunparliamentary in this Assembly.

Every  day  over  the  last  one  week\r\n\r\nparticularly, more in the case of the  non-English\r\n\r\nlanguage  newspapers, there have been pictures  of\r\n\r\npeople  breaking up Belgian embassies in Belgrade,\r\n\r\nWarsaw, and other places in the world. In some  of\r\n\r\nthem, riots; civil commotion even taking place  in\r\n\r\nAmerica  itself.

However, because of our  somewhat\r\n\r\nlimited and conscribed situation, and in case  the\r\n\r\ndemonstration against the Belgians turned, rightly\r\n\r\nor  wrongly,  into a demonstration  against  other\r\n\r\nWestern governments connected or unconnected  with\r\n\r\nthe  death  of  Mr  Lumumba, I  have,  as  Acting\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home  Affairs,  advised   many   an\r\n\r\nassociation  to  restrain  theselves  from   their\r\n\r\nrighteous  desire to show the Belgians  what  they\r\n\r\nthink  of  them  and  to do as  little  damage  as\r\n\r\npossible; and that if we must protest, then let us\r\n\r\ndo  it in a civil and unharmful way in order  that\r\n\r\nthose  who  are thinking of putting up  new  glass\r\n\r\nwindows and putting new things in them need not be\r\n\r\nunnecessarily frightened away. The effect  of  the\r\n\r\nworld   radio,   the   world  Press,   the   radio\r\n\r\nphotographs  that  carry the message  of  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening  in  other parts of the world  will  not\r\n\r\nunnaturally stimulate our own people into  wishing\r\n\r\nto be like what all independent, righteous, decent\r\n\r\npeople all over the world think and do. However, I\r\n\r\nhope that with this explanation, I will have given\r\n\r\nthem  some  grounds for consolation why we  should\r\n\r\nnot  break  a  few glass windows. I  am  told  the\r\n\r\nBelgian Consulate is on one of the upper floors of\r\n\r\nthe  Asia Building, and I asked them to desist  in\r\n\r\ncase  a  few  other windows besides those  in  the\r\n\r\nBelgian  Consulate got broken and people got  hurt\r\n\r\nunwittingly in a demonstration not meant for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are really very few new things that\r\n\r\ncan  be  said on the subject of the death  of  Mr\r\n\r\nLumumba.  Everything that need be  said  has  been\r\n\r\nsaid  so  well  and eloquently by  so  many  other\r\n\r\neminent  people with more powerful pens  and  more\r\n\r\neloquent voices than our own. All I wish to do  is\r\n\r\nto  draw attention, from our point of view,  to  a\r\n\r\nfew salient facts. There are really two issues: 1.\r\n\r\nLumumba the man when he was alive. 2. Lumumba  the\r\n\r\nmyth that has been created\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  his  murder. As for Lumumba the man, we  never\r\n\r\nsaid  anything.  We  stood  for  the  freedom  and\r\n\r\nindependence  of the Congo, and if  the  Congolese\r\n\r\npeople  chose Mr Lumumba as their Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nthen it is their right to do so and he should have\r\n\r\nbeen given the opportunity to carry out his duties\r\n\r\nas  Prime  Minister. It is said in  some  quarters\r\n\r\nthat  he had a somewhat different past and  so  on\r\n\r\nand  so  forth. But whatever he was, the stupidest\r\n\r\nthing  that could have been done was to  kill  him\r\n\r\nand create the myth; and the myth inevitably grows\r\n\r\nbigger and bigger and stronger day by day.  It  is\r\n\r\nthe biggest united front issue on world basis that\r\n\r\nhas  been  created  since the Spanish  Civil  War.\r\n\r\nWhether you are a Right-wing, or a Liberal,  or  a\r\n\r\nFabian,  or  a  Social Democrat, or  a  Democratic\r\n\r\nSocialist,  or  a  Communist, willy-nilly  if  you\r\n\r\nbelieve in decent behaviour, certain standards  of\r\n\r\nhonesty  and  certain  standards  of  what  people\r\n\r\nshould  or should not do, then you must be against\r\n\r\nwhat  has happened. As Mr Nehru said, \"Some  very\r\n\r\nevil  things must have been done with  the  active\r\n\r\nconcurrence  or  connivance  of  people  in   high\r\n\r\nauthority.\" A group of men endowed and vested with\r\n\r\nauthority  and recognised by other governments  in\r\n\r\nthe world did not have the courage to say that Mr\r\n\r\nLumumba  had been executed without even  a  secret\r\n\r\ntrial. It has been said that people in some  parts\r\n\r\nof  the world got executed without a proper trial,\r\n\r\nbut  at  least they were given a trial even though\r\n\r\nit  was  in  secret. When Mr Beria was  executed,\r\n\r\nnobody  heard  about the trial, but  there  was  a\r\n\r\ntrial and there was a proper execution. So was the\r\n\r\ncase with Imre Nagy and other people. But here are\r\n\r\na  group  of  men who did this man in, and  then,\r\n\r\nknowing  full  well  that  what  they  did  was  a\r\n\r\ndisreputable  and outrageous act against  humanity\r\n\r\nand  decent  human  behaviour, said  that  he  had\r\n\r\nescaped.  And ten nations who had good reasons  to\r\n\r\nknow  what  was  happening because  they  all  had\r\n\r\nrepresentatives there immediately said, \"You  have\r\n\r\ndone him in.\" And true enough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey said, \"Yes, he has been dismembered by Baluba\r\n\r\ntribesmen in some unknown village and his  remains\r\n\r\nhave been scattered in some unknown place in order\r\n\r\nthat  he should not be deified.\" And so we are  in\r\n\r\nthe  curious  position  of  finding  ourselves  in\r\n\r\ncomplete  and  absolute unanimity with  a  lot  of\r\n\r\npeople  with  whom  we are often in  disagreement.\r\n\r\nYour  Right-wing  people with the  right  sort  of\r\n\r\nconscience \u2014 I am quite sure Sunday school  teachers\r\n\r\nwho  are Members of this Assembly would revolt  at\r\n\r\nthe thought of doing in an opponent in that way. I\r\n\r\ngrant them at least that much sense of decency and\r\n\r\nmoral  rearmament courage. On the other  hand,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  you  have your dreamy-eyed idealists  and\r\n\r\nLiberals.  They also, in the name of  freedom,  of\r\n\r\nwhat is right and wrong, must denounce it. And  in\r\n\r\nthe extreme, you have your hard-boiled ideological\r\n\r\nCommunists all shouting the same slogan:  \"Lumumba\r\n\r\nthe  myth,  Lumumba the statesman.\" Nobody  called\r\n\r\nhim a statesman when he was alive; but I think  if\r\n\r\nfor  nothing  else  when  he  died  he  became   a\r\n\r\nstatesman, and so it must be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to point out the line and the\r\n\r\nstand that we have decided to take in this motion.\r\n\r\nIf  anybody  differs from this line and  wants  to\r\n\r\ntake  another  line,  let him  do  so.  There  are\r\n\r\nseveral  lines.  One  is the  line  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nRussians:  from the death of Lumumba to down  with\r\n\r\nHammarskjoeld; withdraw the United Nations  troops\r\n\r\nfrom   the  Congo;  recognition  of  Gizenga  (the\r\n\r\nsuccessor to Lumumba), and a host of other things,\r\n\r\nwhich  would  mean another Spanish  Civil  War  or\r\n\r\nanother Korea. It is bound to happen. Then on  the\r\n\r\nother   extreme   end,  there  is  the   American,\r\n\r\nAmbassador  in  the  United  Nations,  Mr   Adlai\r\n\r\nStevenson, who so eloquently put it, \"We  denounce\r\n\r\nall  that has happened is wrong. Never mind  about\r\n\r\nthe  past,  but let us concentrate on the  future.\r\n\r\nAnd  therefore let us think of some  coherent  and\r\n\r\npractical way of resolving it.\" That is the  whole\r\n\r\nproblem.  People cannot forget the past. They  get\r\n\r\nangry  and they get extremely cussed because  some\r\n\r\nvery  serious wrongs have just been done. And then\r\n\r\nthere is the line which we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaking \u2014 the line which has been charted  by  people\r\n\r\nwho sincerely believe it to be wise and who are in\r\n\r\npossession  of  the  facts - to demand  the  minimum\r\n\r\nconditions within which to contain the conflict in\r\n\r\nthe   Congo,  to  prevent  it  from  becoming   an\r\n\r\ninternational arena (either a hot or a cold  one),\r\n\r\nto  create the minimum conditions under which some\r\n\r\nform   of   representative   government   can   be\r\n\r\nestablished, and the will of the Congolese  people\r\n\r\nexpressed   by   their  elected   representatives.\r\n\r\nDifferent   problems  with  different  notes   and\r\n\r\ndifferent  timbre are being sounded in  memory  of\r\n\r\nthe  same  man. They carry different  meanings  to\r\n\r\ndifferent people. But for us \u2014 the uncommitted - the\r\n\r\nsound that we respond to the clarion call that  we\r\n\r\nwould like to join in, is one which says, \"Let  us\r\n\r\ncontain  the  conflict of the  civil  war  in  the\r\n\r\nCongo.  Let us prevent more trouble being  created\r\n\r\nby  new  troops  being sent in and recognition  of\r\n\r\nopposing  governments inside the Congo,  and  give\r\n\r\nthe  Congolese people a chance to get started with\r\n\r\ntheir independence in circumstances which would at\r\n\r\nleast give them a chance of success.\" That is  the\r\n\r\npurport of this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We add our voice to the rousing chorus of\r\n\r\nindignation and, if for nothing else, we would  at\r\n\r\nleast  have added one more protest for  those  who\r\n\r\nare  on  Mount Olympia to hear, since they  decide\r\n\r\nour  fates. I hope that we in Singapore will  give\r\n\r\nthe  lead to the thinking that should be  done  by\r\n\r\npeople  in a position to influence public opinion.\r\n\r\nOne  could get hysterical over this. One could get\r\n\r\nvery angry. But what I am asking this House to  do\r\n\r\nis  soberly, albeit we are angry, to see what this\r\n\r\nmeans to us, what it is doing to our people,  what\r\n\r\nploy  and  play is being done at this moment,  and\r\n\r\nhow  we,  as  the elected representatives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, should lead them in expressing their views\r\n\r\nof  what  is  right  and wrong  in  matters  which\r\n\r\nconcern us, although these matters take place some\r\n\r\nthousands of miles away in some country unknown to\r\n\r\nus,  but  so vitally important to the survival  of\r\n\r\nall of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support the motion of the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peoples of the world are shocked at the news\r\n\r\nof  the  cowardly  murder of Mr  Lumumba.  We  in\r\n\r\nSingapore join in this world-wide demonstration of\r\n\r\nsympathy,  solidarity  and,  friendship  with  the\r\n\r\nCongolese  people.  The whole world  condemns  the\r\n\r\natrocious  acts  of  the  imperialists  and  their\r\n\r\nlackeys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, who are the murderers of Mr Lumumba? The Kasavubus, the Mobutus or the\r\n\r\nTshombes  are only the front Quislings  of  powers\r\n\r\nbehind  the scenes. It is the Belgian colonialists\r\n\r\nassisted   by   the  N.A.T.O. powers   with   the\r\n\r\nconnivance of the United Nations. I cannot believe\r\n\r\nfor  on  moment that the United Nations could  not\r\n\r\nprotect  the  life of Lumumba when it can  protect\r\n\r\nthe lives of ordinary white men in the Congo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must take positive action against\r\n\r\nthe ostensible murderers of Lumumba. At least this\r\n\r\nGovernment must initiate action to boycott Belgian\r\n\r\ngoods. The murders in Sharpeville and in the Congo\r\n\r\nare   as   a   result  of  the  African   people's\r\n\r\ndetermination to fight for freedom.  All  colonial\r\n\r\npowers, be they French, Belgian, Dutch or British,\r\n\r\njoin one common flag for mutual aid. They can only\r\n\r\nhope  to last a bit longer by binding together  in\r\n\r\nthe  face  of  a  common foe. To the anti-colonial\r\n\r\npeople, the fight is like that of a trade union of\r\n\r\nworkers  against an association of employers.  All\r\n\r\ncolonial powers die or fall together. Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\ntherefore necessary for us in Singapore  to  fight\r\n\r\nagainst  British colonialism with renewed  vigour.\r\n\r\nThe  murder of Lumumba is an object lesson for all\r\n\r\ncolonial people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, we must\r\n\r\ntherefore  not forget our own fight  and  our  own\r\n\r\npolitical  prisoners. Our fight, is  part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld-wide fight against colonial forces. I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  ask  the Government to convene  a  mass\r\n\r\nmeeting  in front of the City Hall and invite  all\r\n\r\npolitical  parties, unions and mass  organisations\r\n\r\nto participate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt  this  meeting,  we should demand  the  British\r\n\r\ncolonialists  to free our political prisoners.

Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today\r\n\r\nwe  are  registering a protest against the  brutal\r\n\r\nmurder  of  an  elected leader  of  the  Congolese\r\n\r\npeople. In debating this motion before the  House,\r\n\r\nwe  are,  in  fact, joining with  the  peoples  of\r\n\r\nAfrica and Asia in denouncing colonialism. We  are\r\n\r\njoining the world-wide cry of denunciation of  the\r\n\r\natrocities  committed by the hirelings of  Western\r\n\r\nimperialist powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the essence of the motion before the House\r\n\r\nis  anti-colonial. The struggle for freedom  is  a\r\n\r\nconsistent  struggle. There can be no  compromises\r\n\r\nin  any  way. It would only end if there  is  full\r\n\r\npolitical, social and economic freedom.  While  we\r\n\r\ncondemn  and denounce the colonialists  and  their\r\n\r\nstooges,  we  must not make it merely  a  negative\r\n\r\ncry.  The unanimous call of the Afro-Asian peoples\r\n\r\nis  not negativism. It is a positive call for  the\r\n\r\nrestoration of the fundamental human right  to  be\r\n\r\nfree  from subjugation and exploitation. In  fact,\r\n\r\nit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  a  demand for the restoration of the right  to\r\n\r\ndecide one's own future and destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore, Sir, are far from being free,\r\n\r\neven politically. Colonialism in Singapore has not\r\n\r\nended.  Our  struggle today, as it was before,  is\r\n\r\nstill  largely anti-colonialism. In this phase  we\r\n\r\nendorse  the  aspirations for  which  Mr  Lumumba\r\n\r\nstood.   And   when   we  denounce   and   condemn\r\n\r\nimperialism,  we  must be able to  draw  objective\r\n\r\nlessons  for  the furtherance of our own  struggle\r\n\r\nagainst imperialism. The greatest justice that  we\r\n\r\ncan  do  to  Lumumba  is to  intensify  our\r\n\r\nanti-colonial  struggle  and destroy  all  evidence  of\r\n\r\ncolonialism in this part of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in so far as the Congo is concerned, the\r\n\r\nfacts   are  evidently  clear.  Lumumba  and   his\r\n\r\ncolleagues    were    legally    constituted    as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the Congo. The  fact  that  Mr\r\n\r\nLumumba  was removed, the fact that the\r\n\r\npopularly-elected  Parliament was dissolved,  and  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  Mr Lumumba and his colleagues were arrested\r\n\r\nand  murdered  in cold blood, do  not  change  the\r\n\r\nbasic  proposition.  Killing  the  leader  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  does  not mean killing the aspirations  of\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Col. Mobutu, Tshombe and Kasavubu and the\r\n\r\nN.A.T.O. powers - which  connived  with  them   are\r\n\r\nnothing,  but political criminals. These  traitors\r\n\r\nof  the  Congo people, no matter what  influential\r\n\r\npositions  they now hold, no matter  how  strongly\r\n\r\nthey  are  armed  by the foreign  imperialists  to\r\n\r\nfight  their own people, and no matter how  dearly\r\n\r\nthey  are  petted by colonial powers like Belgium,\r\n\r\nFrance,  Britain and America, cannot be recognised\r\n\r\nby  any  standard as the legal representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe Congolese people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, those who accept Lumumba as the\r\n\r\nrightful  leader  of the Congo people  cannot  but\r\n\r\naccept  anybody,  be  it  Kasavubu  or  Mobutu  or\r\n\r\nTshombe,  or anybody who is anti-Lumumba and  anti\r\n\r\nwhat  he  stood for, as traitors to the  Congolese\r\n\r\ncause. Sir, the only justifiable thing any country\r\n\r\ncould  do, or the United Nations itself could  do,\r\n\r\nis to restore effectively the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegal  Government of Lumumba. Any  solution  which\r\n\r\ndisregards these fundamentals is essentially  anti\r\n\r\nthe Congo people. We in Singapore, Sir, are not in\r\n\r\na position to contribute directly to this struggle\r\n\r\nof  the Congolese people. We have not even come to\r\n\r\nthe  stage where our voice could be heard  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  forum.  But, Sir, we can  make  the  solemn\r\n\r\ndeclaration  that  if we have  the  will  and  the\r\n\r\ndetermination, we must develop the courage to  say\r\n\r\n\"wrong\"  to that which is wrong, and to contribute\r\n\r\nin any way, no matter how small, to denouncing the\r\n\r\natrocities of imperialist powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today the United Nations is\r\n\r\nnothing but a laughing stock. Western imperialists\r\n\r\nare  manipulating the United Nations to give legal\r\n\r\nprotection   for   the  plundering   of   colonial\r\n\r\nterritories.  We  can only hope  that  the  United\r\n\r\nNations Organisation fulfils the objects for which\r\n\r\nit  was  founded. This, Sir, is the hope of \r\n\r\npeace-loving people of the entire world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said earlier that it is necessary, in\r\n\r\ndenouncing colonial intervention in the Congo  and\r\n\r\nin endorsing the struggle of the Congolese people,\r\n\r\nthat we must try to draw objective lessons for the\r\n\r\neradication  of our immediate enemy,  the  British\r\n\r\nimperialists. In Singapore, Sir, colonialism is as\r\n\r\nstrong as ever. There are people who pose as \r\n\r\nanti-colonialists  but  they are not  any  better  than\r\n\r\nKasavubu,   Tshombe,   or   Mobutu.   There    are\r\n\r\nimperialist    agents   working   in    Singapore,\r\n\r\nobstructing the struggles of the people in a  very\r\n\r\nshrewd and cunning manner. The criterion to  judge\r\n\r\nan  anti-colonialist is not the  strength  of  his\r\n\r\nanti-colonial cries, but the record of his  deeds.\r\n\r\nSome  of  these fake anti-colonialists  have  been\r\n\r\nexposed,  but some have not as yet. But,  Sir,  as\r\n\r\nsure  as certainty can be, the day will come  when\r\n\r\ncolonialists  and pro-colonialists, no  matter  in\r\n\r\nwhat  form  they  appear,  will  be  exposed   and\r\n\r\ndestroyed by the will of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our midst we have one of the most\r\n\r\npowerful  colonialist agents, and I want  to  make\r\n\r\ncertain remarks in passing, because I think it  is\r\n\r\nthe responsibility of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  of  us  to take note of the situation.

What I intend to do  is  just\r\n\r\nrelate what I have to say about the Straits  Times\r\n\r\nto  what it has been reporting on Mr Lumumba  and\r\n\r\nthe  Congolese  crisis,  which  I  feel,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nsignificant in the debate on the motion before the\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the hon.

The struggle for\r\n\r\nfreedom,  Sir, is not, as I have said  earlier,  a\r\n\r\ncompromising  one. Freedom is the  birth-right  of\r\n\r\nevery  human being. The sooner we realise that  it\r\n\r\nis  not  a  subject for compromise, the better  it\r\n\r\nwould be for the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I wish to say here now in conclusion, Sir, is\r\n\r\nthat  no  single member, no single politician  has\r\n\r\nbeen   the  crusader  who  has  been  successfully\r\n\r\ncarrying out the struggle to end colonialism.  But\r\n\r\nin  the  past,  the vanguard of the  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nstruggle in Singapore has been the working  class.\r\n\r\nIt   shall  continue  its  mission,  and  ultimate\r\n\r\nvictory  and  freedom will come, not  through  the\r\n\r\nability of individual political leaders or foreign\r\n\r\npolitical  agents,  but  through  the  unrelenting\r\n\r\nstruggle of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we identify ourselves with the spirit of Mr\r\n\r\nLumumba  and the Congolese people, we  must  pause\r\n\r\nand   reiterate  our  anti-colonial   stand.   The\r\n\r\nstruggle in Singapore is led by the working class.\r\n\r\nNo  imperialist power, no pro-imperialists  or  no\r\n\r\nagents  of  the imperialists, no matter  in  what\r\n\r\ninfluential  position they are, whether  they  own\r\n\r\nnewspapers  or  not,  can stop  the  will  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nOpposition wholeheartedly supports the motion. The\r\n\r\nCongo  situation  has become very  explosive,  and\r\n\r\nunless  the  United Nations handle  the  situation\r\n\r\nwith  firmness and determination to bring law  and\r\n\r\norder, there will be chaos and many deaths will be\r\n\r\nlaid at the door of the United Nations. We support\r\n\r\nthe  motion,  Sir, because we not only  abhor  but\r\n\r\ndeplore the killing of any political leader of any\r\n\r\npolitical  party in any country.  This  method  of\r\n\r\npolitical  elimination should be  condemned.  Sir,\r\n\r\nMalaya has set a very fine example to the world in\r\n\r\nher  handling of the Congo situation. Her soldiers\r\n\r\nin  the Congo have done a very fine job, and  they\r\n\r\nhave not been found wanting.

In\r\n\r\nthis motion I feel that the Government should give\r\n\r\nconsideration to a contribution towards the  Congo\r\n\r\nCheer  Fund as a token of Singapore's appreciation\r\n\r\nof  the  good  work that the Malayan soldiers  are\r\n\r\ndoing in the international field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Opposition does not propose to make a\r\n\r\nlong  political  speech. In fact,  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nfinds it difficult to understand the speech  of\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Member for Thomson, especially after the\r\n\r\nsober and responsible speech of the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nin  moving the motion. The stand of the Opposition\r\n\r\nis  clear. We are with the motion one hundred  per\r\n\r\ncent,  and we do not require, like the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor Thomson, to use language that may tend to give\r\n\r\nthe impression to the people of Singapore that the\r\n\r\nCongo  situation is an all absorbing  matter  that\r\n\r\nrequires their full interest and that they  should\r\n\r\ntry  not to remember the burning question  of  the\r\n\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Member wishes to speak?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

Sir, I have\r\n\r\nindicated that what we want to do today is to add\r\n\r\none  more voice in the world forum, albeit we  are\r\n\r\nnot  in  the United Nations; because in a position\r\n\r\nof  no  total war, the voices of groups of people,\r\n\r\nof  nations, of Governments, add to the sum  total\r\n\r\nof  world opinion, which finally decides  big  and\r\n\r\nburning  issues which are settled by the  gods  on\r\n\r\nthis  earth in Mount Olympia where they meet  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time, either in Geneva or in the  United\r\n\r\nNations. Not that we believe, of course,  that  we\r\n\r\nare  not  fully  aware of the  difficult  problems\r\n\r\nwhich  lie  in  the  path of all  those  who  seek\r\n\r\nfreedom,  liberty  and  a better  life  for  their\r\n\r\npeople.   In  Algeria,  it  has  meant   downright\r\n\r\nshooting and killing of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  French until the last blow has been delivered\r\n\r\nand the French side says, \"We have had enough. Let\r\n\r\nus  stop.\"  In  the  Congo, a different  situation\r\n\r\nprevails.  True, riots persuaded the  Belgians  to\r\n\r\ngive  over political and theoretical independence,\r\n\r\nhoping by their controls on the administration  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  their  economic  and  military  position\r\n\r\nthere.  That  blew  up  in their  faces,  and  the\r\n\r\nposition  has  collapsed.  And  because  political\r\n\r\nindependence  has been granted, the  Belgians  are\r\n\r\nnow  guilty of a heinous crime in meddling in  the\r\n\r\naffairs  of  the  Congo, either  directly  through\r\n\r\ntheir   administrators or  their  soldiers,   or\r\n\r\nindirectly  by  supporting  people  like  Tshombe,\r\n\r\nMobutu  and,  it  has  even been  said,  Kasavubu,\r\n\r\neither  through arms or finance, and to  make  the\r\n\r\narms prevail over the politicians. The Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill found himself in the same company.  \"Let\r\n\r\nus,\"  he said on the Algerian issue, \"likewise  do\r\n\r\nthe  same  in  Singapore, i.e. fight for  freedom,\r\n\r\nrelentlessly,  manfully, and courageously  to  the\r\n\r\nbitter end.\" The Member for Aljunied says, \"Let us\r\n\r\ndo  so  by calling a mass meeting.\" Let me explain\r\n\r\nfirst.  If you say that independence for Singapore\r\n\r\nby  itself is a must and a necessary step forward,\r\n\r\nthen  I say you must be prepared to pay the price.\r\n\r\nAnd whatever our shortcomings, we are prepared  to\r\n\r\npay  the price of the things we seek. But  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen our proposition from the very beginning - and I\r\n\r\nwould  welcome an opportunity in this House or  in\r\n\r\nHong  Lim, if the Member for Cairnhill would  send\r\n\r\nhis    representative   there,   to   debate   the\r\n\r\nproposition  that  Singapore  can  and   must   be\r\n\r\nindependent by itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do admit that perhaps the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has been jockeyed into saying  what\r\n\r\nhe  is  saying, but I have already ruled that  all\r\n\r\nthat  is  not relevant to the present  motion.  In\r\n\r\nfact, I did over-rule the Member for Aljunied when\r\n\r\nhe  embarked on a similar proposition. I  ask  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister not to deal with that topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Very well, Mr Speaker.

We  are talking of colonialism, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  and I am talking in abstracto, no longer  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as independent, which is a bigger issue:\r\n\r\nwhether you have independence through merger  with\r\n\r\nMalaya  or  whether  you  have  independence   for\r\n\r\nSingapore by itself. But I am aghast at the number\r\n\r\nof  phoney would-be martyr who all want to be like\r\n\r\nMr Lumumba when they know full well that they are\r\n\r\nin  no danger of liquidation. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to see fierce men in fierce situations.\r\n\r\nThen  I  admire them. When there is  a  danger  of\r\n\r\nannihilation  and  liquidation,  and  then  fierce\r\n\r\nwords are spoken. Not just stones are thrown,  but\r\n\r\ngrenades  and  mortars \u2014 hand-made ones \u2014 are  thrown;\r\n\r\nand  in  return a big bomb from an aircraft  which\r\n\r\ncomes down, as they do in Algeria, and smacks  you\r\n\r\nout.

The Prime Minister is perhaps\r\n\r\nforgetting  that he is replying and not  making  a\r\n\r\nnew speech.

I had already made those two  points\r\n\r\nwhich I thought would have rounded up the argument\r\n\r\nnicely.  But the task I am now confronted with  is\r\n\r\nto  embark altogether on another theme, the  \r\n\r\nanti-colonial  crusade which is going on all  over  the\r\n\r\nwhole  world but which, in our circumstances,  has\r\n\r\nto be interpreted in an intelligent and courageous\r\n\r\nmanner. Courage means not just taking a stone  and\r\n\r\nthrowing  it;  but courage means, firstly,  having\r\n\r\nthe intelligence not to throw a bomb when you know\r\n\r\nit   is  going  to  break  your  own  window;  and\r\n\r\nsecondly, saying you are not going to throw a bomb\r\n\r\nwhen you are in the midst of phoney fierce men.

Therefore, I require no courage\r\n\r\nto  invite people to liquidate me, people  whom  I\r\n\r\nknow have not the slightest intention of doing so.\r\n\r\nLet  me  remind  the Member for Aljunied  that  we\r\n\r\nwould have held more than just a protest rally  if\r\n\r\nanybody  in  a detention camp had been  liquidated\r\n\r\nlike   Mr  Lumumba.

Justice\r\n\r\nby  ensuring  that those who have committed  this\r\n\r\ncrime  should be brought to book, that a properly\r\n\r\nconstituted  government  should  be  allowed   to\r\n\r\nemerge  from the Congolese Parliament,  and  that\r\n\r\nthe wherewithal of an effective government should\r\n\r\nbe granted to the people of the Congo through the\r\n\r\nassistance of the United Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last word on the United Nations, Sir. One\r\n\r\nof  the  most curious things about the  ploy  and\r\n\r\nplay  of propaganda in the Press and in the radio\r\n\r\nis  an often informed and tremendously solid  and\r\n\r\nfirm  conclusion on the basis of third or \r\n\r\nfourth-hand   information   reported   in   the   Press.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  only basis on which  people  who\r\n\r\nhave  not  got representatives in the  Congo  can\r\n\r\nwork  in  the  formulation and  pronouncement  of\r\n\r\npolicy  made  by  people in  authority  who  have\r\n\r\nrepresentatives there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say this: that Mr Dayal, the United\r\n\r\nNations  representative in the Congo (he  happens\r\n\r\nto  be  an  Indian, but he is the United  Nations\r\n\r\nrepresentative  who  represents  the \r\n\r\nSecretary-General  in  the  Congo) is a man  of  integrity,\r\n\r\nacknowledged  all  round.  He  has   never   been\r\n\r\nattacked  by  Mr Khruschev. He  has  never  been\r\n\r\nattacked  by  the  Americans,  or  even  by   the\r\n\r\nBelgians. Sir, he has never been attacked by  any\r\n\r\nAfro-Asian  powers. Presumably, we must  conclude\r\n\r\nthat  he is a man of some considerable integrity.\r\n\r\nHe has published reports from time to time and  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is a pity that such reports  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  read  more  by  Members of  this  Assembly,\r\n\r\nparticularly if they have to make speeches on the\r\n\r\nmatter.  I  hope through you, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nsuch  valuable material should be made  available\r\n\r\nin the Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is clear is this. Mr Nehru undoubtedly is\r\n\r\nwell-informed, and whatever else he  may  or  may\r\n\r\nnot  know,  in his formulation of policy  he  has\r\n\r\nmade   clear   that  to  abolish  the \r\n\r\nSecretary-Generalship of the United Nations or to  withdraw\r\n\r\nUnited Nations operations in the Congo must  mean\r\n\r\nchaos,  disaster  and  civil  war;  a  civil  war\r\n\r\nleading  to international intervention on  a  big\r\n\r\nscale  in  the  Congo. I know nothing  about  the\r\n\r\nCongo, Sir. All I know is Mr Dayal's credentials\r\n\r\nand what Mr Nehru has publicly said. I would say\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Nehru is not a man likely  to  mislead\r\n\r\nother people, nor India. And the odds are that if\r\n\r\nhe  is prepared, on behalf of his Government  and\r\n\r\nthe nearly 400 million people of India, to commit\r\n\r\nthem  to  what  he thinks is right, despite  what\r\n\r\nother countries are shouting and wishing to  have\r\n\r\nhappen  in the Congo, then I say that is a  point\r\n\r\nof view worth thinking about. I would like to see\r\n\r\na great deal of evidence to the contrary before I\r\n\r\ndiscard that point of view on the ground that  he\r\n\r\nhas been ill-informed, or that it is erroneous or\r\n\r\nmisguided.   Sir,   on  the  authority   of   the\r\n\r\ncredentials  of those people who  have  not  been\r\n\r\nchallenged  by  any  side, I ask  this  Assembly,\r\n\r\nwithout a dissenting voice, to give approval to a\r\n\r\nresolution which is in the same terms and  spirit\r\n\r\nas that presented by three small nations, with no Big  Power  interests in the Congo,  or  anywhere\r\n\r\nelse  in the world, and which is put forward  for\r\n\r\nthe  sake  of  the  peace of the  world  and  the\r\n\r\nhappiness of the small nations, as well as  those\r\n\r\nof the big ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
