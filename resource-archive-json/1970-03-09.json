However,\r\n\r\nsection  11  of the Pensions Ordinance, 1956,  does\r\n\r\nnot  allow  the assignment or the transfer  of  the\r\n\r\ngratuity  except  for  certain specified  purposes.\r\n\r\nWith  the  concurrence of the Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nit  is  proposed  to form a working  cornmittee  of\r\n\r\nofficials  to  formulate a scheme to  enable  civil\r\n\r\nservants on the verge of retirement to make use  of\r\n\r\ntheir  gratuities in order to purchase Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is 3.30 p.m. now.

This was the decade which the  United\r\n\r\nNations christened \"The Decade of Development\". For\r\n\r\nus  in  Singapore, it was a turbulent decade during\r\n\r\nwhich   momentous  changes  took  place.  Singapore\r\n\r\nentered  the 1960s as a British colony  with  self-governing  powers  in domestic  affairs.  We  later\r\n\r\nachieved   independence  as  part  of   independent\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  only to be expelled from the  Federation\r\n\r\nafter   two   years.  On  August  9th,  1965,   the\r\n\r\nindependent Republic of Singapore was created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to confine my review of the decade to\r\n\r\nSingapore's economic performance. I was engaged for\r\n\r\nmost  of the decade in a Ministry which was charged\r\n\r\nwith  the  responsibility for economic  development\r\n\r\nand  planning  in Singapore. It is  not  altogether\r\n\r\npossible for me to escape bias, either in treatment\r\n\r\nor  emphasis,  in  this account of  the  Republic's\r\n\r\neconomic  growth.  No  doubt some  future  economic\r\n\r\nhistorian  will  cover  the same  ground  and  will\r\n\r\nprobably see events in a somewhat different  light.\r\n\r\nHe  will  also  treat the subject more exhaustively\r\n\r\nthan is possible in a Budget address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to conduct this review of Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomic development in the 1960s in two ways.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  to compare the positions as in 1959  and\r\n\r\n1969, taking two snapshot pictures, so to speak, of\r\n\r\nthe main economic terrain. Secondly, I will try  to\r\n\r\ntrace developments through the different phases  of\r\n\r\nthe   decade,   in   a  kind  of   motion   picture\r\n\r\npresentation, if I may be permitted to  extend  the\r\n\r\nanalogy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the snapshot pictures. Singapore's Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic  Product in 1959 was $1,968  million.  The\r\n\r\nGross  Domestic Product is the value of  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices produced within the geographical  area  of\r\n\r\nthe  Republic. They include the value of foodstuffs\r\n\r\nproduced  by  our  farmers,  the  earnings  of  our\r\n\r\ntraders  and shipowners on the entrepot trade,  the\r\n\r\nvalue   added  in  Singapore  in  the   course   of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  operations, the earnings  of  retail\r\n\r\ntrade, the hotel business, and other services,  the\r\n\r\nvalue   of   services  provided  by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment, British military expenditure,  and  the\r\n\r\nvalue   of  construction  of  new  roads,   houses,\r\n\r\nfactories,  power-stations and  so  on.  The  Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic Product is a close relative of the G.N.P.,\r\n\r\nor Gross National Product, and differs from it only\r\n\r\nin  that  the G.N.P, includes earnings of Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens   from  overseas  sources   and   excludes\r\n\r\nearnings  in  Singapore  accruing  to  persons  and\r\n\r\ncorporations abroad. In this account, I  shall  use\r\n\r\nthe  Gross  Domestic Product rather than the  Gross\r\n\r\nNational Product since calculation of the latter is\r\n\r\nsubject to greater uncertainty and error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1969, the G.D.P. had increased from $1,968.\r\n\r\nmillion  by  nearly 2\u00bd times to $4,833  million.\r\n\r\nThis represents a compound growth rate through  the\r\n\r\ndecade  of  9.4 per cent a year. We have  therefore\r\n\r\nsurpassed the United Nations target for the  Decade\r\n\r\nof  Development of 5 per cent annual growth. At the\r\n\r\nsame  time, our performance was well below that  of\r\n\r\nsome  other economies such as those of Japan, South\r\n\r\nKorea in recent years, and Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doubling of the G.D.P. during the l960s was\r\n\r\nnot  due  to  discoveries of natural  resources  as\r\n\r\nthese  are  virtually absent. It was the result  of\r\n\r\nthe  growth  of  trade, on the one  hand,  and  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  industry,  on the other,  with  tourist\r\n\r\ndevelopment   providing   a   small   but   welcome\r\n\r\nincrement.  In  other words,  it  was  largely  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  greater human effort.  Associated  with\r\n\r\ngrowth of the G.D.P. has been a much faster rate of\r\n\r\ncapital  investment in the Republic. The accounting\r\n\r\naggregate representing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapital   investment  -  Gross   Domestic   Capital\r\n\r\nFormation   in   the  terminology  recommended   by\r\n\r\nstatisticians of the United Nations increased  from\r\n\r\n$150 million in 1959 to $919 million in 1969. Total\r\n\r\ninvestment increased at more than twice the rate of\r\n\r\nincrease of the domestic product, a compound annual\r\n\r\nrate  of 19.8 per cent during the decade. In  1959,\r\n\r\ntotal  investment amounted to 7.6 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nG.D.P. and  this increased to 19.0  per  cent  ten\r\n\r\nyears  later. Ploughing back an increasing part  of\r\n\r\nour  domestic  output is essential to  sustain  our\r\n\r\ngrowth  momentum and we should continue to increase\r\n\r\nthis  percentage. We are still a  long  way  behind\r\n\r\nJapan  which invests more than 30 per cent  of  its\r\n\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since much of investment was in industrial\r\n\r\nmachinery   and   equipment,   industrial    output\r\n\r\nnaturally  expanded. Industrial output is sometimes\r\n\r\ndefined   as   the  output  of  the  manufacturing,\r\n\r\nconstruction and utilities sectors. Their  combined\r\n\r\noutput  increased, as one would expect, at a faster\r\n\r\nrate  than  the G.D.P. The compound rate of  growth\r\n\r\nfor  1959-1969 was 16.2 per cent as against 9.4 per\r\n\r\ncent,    the   overall   economic   growth    rate.\r\n\r\nManufacturing industries grew at 17.1  per  cent  a\r\n\r\nyear,  construction  at 17.9 per  cent  and  public\r\n\r\nutilities  at  10.2 per cent. In value  terms,  the\r\n\r\nindustrial sector's contribution to the G.D.P. rose\r\n\r\nfrom  $256  million  in 1959 to $1,154  million  in\r\n\r\n1969.  Employment  in the manufacturing  sector  as\r\n\r\ndetermined  in  the annual census  of  manufactures\r\n\r\ncovering  establishments employing ten  workers  or\r\n\r\nmore,  increased  from 25,199 to 87,128.  Of  these\r\n\r\nlatter,  no  less  than  35,000  were  employed  in\r\n\r\npioneer  industries in 1969. There were, of course,\r\n\r\nno pioneer industries in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepot trade also seems to have flourished\r\n\r\nduring  the  decade though, as we shall see  later,\r\n\r\nthere  were  many  ups  and  downs.  There  was  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  total cargo handled at  the  Port  of\r\n\r\nSingapore from 14.2 million freight tons in 1959 to\r\n\r\n37.7 million freight tons in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1969.  The number of ships increased from 9,584  to\r\n\r\n16,531. Passenger arrivals at the beginning of  the\r\n\r\ndecade  totalled  a mere 163,000 and  increased  to\r\n\r\n546,000. Economic growth of these proportions  must\r\n\r\nnaturally  be reflected in the financial  structure\r\n\r\nof  the Republic. There was a substantial expansion\r\n\r\nduring  the decade in the commercial bank deposits,\r\n\r\nfrom  $816 million to no less than $2,745  million.\r\n\r\nThe Central Provident Fund balances standing to the\r\n\r\ncredit  of  members increased from $120 million  to\r\n\r\n$632  million.  Government revenue  benefited  from\r\n\r\nexpansion,  increasing in a decade  from  a  paltry\r\n\r\n$275 million to $934 million. Despite expansion  of\r\n\r\noutput,  volume  of trade and total investment,  as\r\n\r\nwell as money supply, there was a marked absence of\r\n\r\ninflationary pressure. The consumer price index  as\r\n\r\nat  mid-1969 stood at 110.9 with mid-1960 providing\r\n\r\nthe  base-mark of 100.0. In a world where inflation\r\n\r\nplagues  many  countries, both rich  and  poor,  an\r\n\r\naverage annual increase of one per cent in consumer\r\n\r\nprices over a decade is not a common experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic growth has had beneficial effects on\r\n\r\nsocial  conditions. One of the results of  improved\r\n\r\nstandards of living has been a substantial  decline\r\n\r\nin   the   rate  of  population  growth.  Infantile\r\n\r\nmortality rates also declined. School enrolment and\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  education increased substantially.\r\n\r\nNewspaper circulation nearly trebled. Housing Board\r\n\r\nflats and shops increased from - 23,019 to 106,418.\r\n\r\nHappily,   increase  in  crime  and   violence,   a\r\n\r\ncontemporary phenomenon in many cities in both  the\r\n\r\ndeveloped  and  under-developed  world,   did   not\r\n\r\nafflict  us. Armed robbery and housebreaking  cases\r\n\r\nnumbered  3,125  in 1959 compared  with  a  reduced\r\n\r\nfigure of 2,010 in 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the convenience of Members, as well as for the\r\n\r\nrecord, I am circulating statistical tables* which set out in compact form the facts, a narrative  of\r\n\r\nwhich would be  long, tedious and possibly incomprehensible.

These are\r\n\r\nthe  intangible yet supremely important factors for\r\n\r\nprogress  of any society. By our common  endeavours\r\n\r\nand  achievements,  we  are  slowly  acquiring   an\r\n\r\nidentity of purpose and in this way building  up  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  belonging and nationhood. The  rootless,\r\n\r\nmigrant  and parvenu values, where each is out  for\r\n\r\nhimself, attitudes so prevalent at the beginning of\r\n\r\nthe  last  decade, are giving way to more  positive\r\n\r\ngroup  values of a self-reliant people,  determined\r\n\r\nto  build an enduring future for themselves in this\r\n\r\npart of the world. In the final analysis, it is  on\r\n\r\nthe  firm framework of these values rather than  on\r\n\r\nsteel   and   concrete  structures  that   economic\r\n\r\nprogress is to be achieved and sustained. Max Weber\r\n\r\nwas  the  first, but he will not be  the  last,  to\r\n\r\ndetect   in   particular   societies   the    close\r\n\r\ninteraction   between  ethical  systems   and   the\r\n\r\nmodernising   processes  which   enables   economic\r\n\r\ntransformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now trace in outline the development of\r\n\r\nthe economy during the decade. Singapore's economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  can be conveniently grouped  in  three\r\n\r\nperiods - pre-Malaysia, during Malaysia, and  post-Malaysia.   Since   the  most   relevant   economic\r\n\r\nstatistics  are  given in terms of calendar  years,\r\n\r\nthe    three   phases   of   Singapore's   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment may be considered in the calendar  year\r\n\r\nperiods as follows:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                     (i) 1959-63\r\n\r\n                    (ii) 1964-65\r\n\r\n                   (iii) 1966-69\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>It  should  be  remembered, however, that  economic\r\n\r\ntrends  sometimes  transcend two or  more  periods.\r\n\r\nThis    results   from   anticipation   of   future\r\n\r\ndevelopment, as for instance, in the years 1962  to\r\n\r\n1963,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  several industrial projects were  started  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  anticipation of a Common  Market  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Further, the lead time needed  to  see  a\r\n\r\nproject  off the ground - the interval between  the\r\n\r\nmoment  a  decision is taken and the completion  of\r\n\r\nthe  project - often occupies a period  of  several\r\n\r\nyears for large scale projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic Development, 1959-63</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pre-Malaysia period was dominated by\r\n\r\npolitical  events. Several of the  more  discerning\r\n\r\nobservers  knew  in 1959 when the general  election\r\n\r\nwas  won  by the People's Action Party that  behind\r\n\r\nthe    anti-colonial   solidarity,   was   a   deep\r\n\r\nideological division between a Democratic Socialist\r\n\r\nfaction  and  a  pro-Communist faction.  It  was  a\r\n\r\nmatter of time before the two groups were forced to\r\n\r\nbring  their  differences into  the  open  as  they\r\n\r\ncontended  for political supremacy. The  policy  of\r\n\r\nthe   Government,  which  consisted  of  democratic\r\n\r\nsocialists, was determined at that time more by the\r\n\r\nimmediate  political necessities than by  long-term\r\n\r\nneeds  of  economic development. The pro-Communists\r\n\r\nbroke  off  from the P.A.P. and their United  Front\r\n\r\nforces  fought the P.A.P. in the Anson  by-election\r\n\r\nin   July  of  1961.  They  joined  issue  on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  to negotiate  a  merger  with\r\n\r\nMalaya  to  form  Malaysia. All  this  is  familiar\r\n\r\nhistory.  But  events  of  such  traumatic   impact\r\n\r\ninevitably  leave their mark on the economy,  as  I\r\n\r\nshall shortly demonstrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, despite the political preoccupation of\r\n\r\nthe  Government, the Economic Development Board was\r\n\r\nestablished in August 1961. It was charged with the\r\n\r\nduty  of  promoting  the growth  of  industries  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  At the same time, the former  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust was absorbed in a more  effective\r\n\r\nagency  named  the  Housing and Development  Board.\r\n\r\nWhile the creation of new industries, by its nature\r\n\r\nrequiring a substantial lead time, could  not  show\r\n\r\nquick  results, Government action in improving  the\r\n\r\nsocial   services  produced  swift   and   tangible\r\n\r\nbenefits in the pre-Malaysia period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate action was taken to extend and improve\r\n\r\nthe  education  system. School  enrolment  both  at\r\n\r\nprimary  and  secondary stages  increased  rapidly.\r\n\r\nPrimary school enrolment increased from 266,625  to\r\n\r\n336,163  between  1959 and 1963;  secondary  school\r\n\r\nenrolment increased from 48,723 to 84,425.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board suffered some\r\n\r\ninitial   troubles  under  the  former   mayor   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  After his replacement, the  Board  soon\r\n\r\ngot  into stride and showed dramatic progress.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of flats and shops built each year  was  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                    1959 --  1,611\r\n\r\n                    1960 --  1,682\r\n\r\n                    1961 --  7,320\r\n\r\n                    1962 -- 12,230\r\n\r\n                    1963 -- 10,085\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because industries took a long time in getting\r\n\r\nstarted  and because there was little expansion  in\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade earnings during this period  -  the\r\n\r\ngrowth rate was a mere 4.5 per cent per year -  the\r\n\r\nsubstantial  housing  programme  launched  by   the\r\n\r\nHousing   Board  undoubtedly  helped   to   sustain\r\n\r\neconomic expansion during this period. The  finance\r\n\r\nto pay for this had to be obtained by civil service\r\n\r\npay  cuts and tax increases, measures which did not\r\n\r\nincrease the Government's popularity rating. During\r\n\r\nthis  period, the Gross Domestic Product  increased\r\n\r\nfrom   $1,968  million  to  $2,684  million.   This\r\n\r\nrepresented a compound growth rate of 8.1 per  cent\r\n\r\na year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Housing Board building\r\n\r\nprogramme,  the construction industry prospered  in\r\n\r\nthe  second  half  of  the period,  generating  the\r\n\r\nfollowing net output:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n              1959 -- $40.0 million\r\n\r\n              1960 -- $41.9 million\r\n\r\n              1961 -- $56.0 million\r\n\r\n              1962 -- $70.0 million\r\n\r\n              1963 -- $94.7 million\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br>The   construction  industry  during  this   period\r\n\r\nincreased at 24.0 per cent a year. The impetus came\r\n\r\nmainly  from Government expenditure in the  housing\r\n\r\nfield. Increase of public sector investment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduring  this period was at a compound rate of  27.5\r\n\r\nper  cent.  The present rate, between 1965-69,  has\r\n\r\nbeen  10.5  per  cent  growth rate  in  the  public\r\n\r\nsector, a more moderate pace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political in-fighting between the Communist\r\n\r\nUnited Front (C.U.F.) and the P.A.P. resulted in  a\r\n\r\nlarge  number  of strikes called by the  C.U.F. as\r\n\r\npart  of its attempt to coerce the Government.  The\r\n\r\nnumber of man-days lost in strikes was as follows:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                    1960 -- 152,005\r\n\r\n                    1961 -- 410,891\r\n\r\n                    1962 -- 164,936\r\n\r\n                    1963 -- 388,219\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defeat of the Communist United Front in the\r\n\r\nReferendum  of August 1962, followed by  subsequent\r\n\r\nsecurity action against them, restored a measure of\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace. In 1964, strikes  accounted  for\r\n\r\nloss  of only 35,908 man-days. In 1969, the  figure\r\n\r\nwas 8,512.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a period when unemployment was heavy,\r\n\r\ntrade  union  irresponsibility on  such  a  massive\r\n\r\nscale    was   hardly   conducive   to   industrial\r\n\r\ninvestment. The following figures of employment  in\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing industries as  recorded  in  the\r\n\r\nannual   census  of  manufactures  show  that   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector was virtually stagnant between\r\n\r\n1959  and 1962 and registered only a small increase\r\n\r\nin 1963. The employment figures are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                     1960 - 26,697\r\n\r\n                     1961 - 26,837\r\n\r\n                     1962 - 27,924\r\n\r\n                     1963 - 35,256\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>Employment  in  pioneer industries,  the  first  of\r\n\r\nwhich went into production in\r\n\r\n1961,  increased from 241 workers to 2,654  at  the\r\n\r\nend of 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not easy to get started. The domestic\r\n\r\nmarket was small, as it still is today. Wages  were\r\n\r\nthen high compared to other Asian countries such as\r\n\r\nHong  Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. On top  of  all\r\n\r\nthis, a near-endemic situation of management-labour\r\n\r\nconflict  arose  out of the show-down  between  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic and pro-Communist forces. Despite  these\r\n\r\nhandicaps, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  proceeded  with its  development  plans\r\n\r\nwith  a  confidence  few  believed  justified.   In\r\n\r\nSeptember  1961  earth-moving operations  commenced\r\n\r\nwhen the first bulldozer moved into Jurong. By  the\r\n\r\nend  of 1962, 1,100 acres of prepared land had been\r\n\r\nlevelled by cutting\r\n\r\ndown  hills and filling swamps. By the end of 1963,\r\n\r\n1,800  acres had been prepared. Twenty-four million\r\n\r\ncubic  yards had been moved in the process. Jurong,\r\n\r\nas  of  December  1963, had only two  factories  in\r\n\r\nproduction  to  show for this mountain  of  labour.\r\n\r\nThey  were  the National Iron and Steel  Mills  and\r\n\r\nPelican  Textiles. Between then, they  employed  90\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic Development, 1963-65</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's entry into the Federation of Malaysia\r\n\r\nin  September, 1963 was preceded by many months  of\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  While the political arrangements  in\r\n\r\nthe   new   Federation  were  agreed   to   without\r\n\r\ndifficulty,  negotiations on financial  arrangement\r\n\r\nand  over the structure of the Common Market proved\r\n\r\nunexpectedly  long and difficult, in  the  end,  a\r\n\r\ncompromise  solution was found,  literally  at  the\r\n\r\neleventh  hour  in  London. Our membership  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Federation proved to be shortlived.  The\r\n\r\nreasons for the sudden separation of Singapore from\r\n\r\nMalaysia  are now past history, as are  the  events\r\n\r\nwhich  led  to  it. So far as Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  is  concerned, hopes for  a  Malaysian\r\n\r\nCommon   Market   had  led  to  some   anticipatory\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  1963. However, the proclamation  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  Federation  was greeted  by  unexpectedly\r\n\r\nstrong   reaction  from  the  Soekarno  regime   of\r\n\r\nIndonesia. Confrontation was declared, and with it\r\n\r\nthe   curtailment  of  our  entrepot   trade   with\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national economic aggregates show the results\r\n\r\nof   the   factors   I   mentioned   -   Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation,  the  abortive  Common  Market  with\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  the  financial arrangement  between  the\r\n\r\nStates and Federal Government. Of the three periods\r\n\r\nof the last decade, the years we spent in Malaysia\r\n\r\nshowed the lowest growth rates of Gross\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDomestic  Product,  a  mere  6.5  per  cent  annual\r\n\r\ngrowth. This was due to the substantial decline  of\r\n\r\nour  entrepot trade by some 16.8 per cent as  trade\r\n\r\nrelations with Indonesia were severed. As a result,\r\n\r\nearnings  on the entrepot trade declined from  $441\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1963 to $306 million in 1965.  Further,\r\n\r\nagriculture  and  fishing, never  noted  for  rapid\r\n\r\ngrowth, showed a decline of 2.5 per cent. This  was\r\n\r\nthe  result  of night curfews imposed in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwaters   for  security  reasons,  which   adversely\r\n\r\naffected the livelihood of fishermen. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  there was a very large increase in the value\r\n\r\nof  British  military  expenditure,  as  one  would\r\n\r\nexpect.  British military expenditure increased  by\r\n\r\n27.7 per cent in 1964 and again by 25.9 per cent in\r\n\r\n1965.  In  absolute terms, this meant  an  increase\r\n\r\nfrom  $323 million in 1963 to $519 million in 1965.\r\n\r\nThis  was, sufficient to make good entrepot  trade\r\n\r\nlosses, taking the two years together. But the year\r\n\r\n1964  was  a particularly bad year; the decline  in\r\n\r\nentrepot   earnings  was  much  greater  than   the\r\n\r\nincrease in British military expenditure. Accordingly, the Gross Domestic Product for that year showed\r\n\r\nthe  least increase of the decade, a mere  0.5  per\r\n\r\ncent.    But   for   increased   British   military\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  there would have been  a  substantial\r\n\r\ndecline.  The Gross Domestic Product  for  the  two\r\n\r\nyears we were in Malaysia were:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n              1964  ...  $2,700 million\r\n\r\n              1965  ...  $3,043 million\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Indonesian confrontation, total\r\n\r\ninvestments continued to expand and at a brisk rate\r\n\r\ntoo. Gross capital formation increased at an annual\r\n\r\nrate of 20.6 per cent, running at $421 million  and\r\n\r\n$476  million  in  1964 and 1965 respectively.  The\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industry forged ahead  in  spite  of\r\n\r\npoor trading conditions and deteriorating relations\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Singapore and Malaysian  Governments.\r\n\r\nManufacturing, construction and utilities showed  a\r\n\r\ncombined  average  of 16.2 per cent  annual  growth\r\n\r\nrate  during Malaysia as compared with 14.7 per cent\r\n\r\nin  pre-Malaysia.  Employment in the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustry increased moderately, some 14.2 per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncent  a year. The increase of employment was  about\r\n\r\n10,000  over  the  two years, the  1965  census  of\r\n\r\nmanufactures giving a total of 46,020 employees for\r\n\r\n1965  as  against  35,256 two  years  earlier.  The\r\n\r\nLabour Department work force figures also showed an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  about the same amount,  188,701  for\r\n\r\n1965  as  against 178,787 for 1963. It is  apparent\r\n\r\nthat  the manufacturing industry was providing  the\r\n\r\nmain new job opportunities. But these never reached\r\n\r\nthe  proportions  which would  reduce  unemployment\r\n\r\nsignificantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The onerous terms of the financial agreement\r\n\r\nunder  which  we  entered Malaysia  resulted  in  a\r\n\r\ndecline in our overseas assets for the only time in\r\n\r\nthe  decade.  Our overseas assets  which  stood  at\r\n\r\n$748.4  million at the end of 1963 were reduced  to\r\n\r\n$631.0 million at the end of 1965.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic Development, 1966-69</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the last period under review, the\r\n\r\nyears  as  an independent sovereign state.  On  the\r\n\r\nmorning of August 9th, 1965, I was in my office  in\r\n\r\nFullerton  Building  brooding  over  the   enormous\r\n\r\nproblems facing the country and the Government. The\r\n\r\nproblems  of  the  future  loomed  in  awesome  and\r\n\r\nintimidating proportions. Here we were,  an  island\r\n\r\ntrading  outpost, with its economic  hinterland  in\r\n\r\nother   countries,  a  vulnerable  arrangement   as\r\n\r\nconfrontation  had shown. Our token defence  forces\r\n\r\nwere  manned mostly by citizens of another country.\r\n\r\nEven  the water we drank had to be mostly imported.\r\n\r\nWe  had  no natural resources other than a diligent\r\n\r\nand  enterprising people. At 10.00 a.m, news of the\r\n\r\nseparation  was announced over the  Radio.  It  was\r\n\r\ngreeted  by the firing of crackers in Chinatown.  I\r\n\r\nthought  this a light-hearted response to  a  grave\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years later, in my Budget Statement of\r\n\r\nDecember 1967, I was able to say, \"After two  years\r\n\r\nof independent existence, the Republic of Singapore\r\n\r\ncontinues not only to survive but also to flourish,\r\n\r\nto the surprise of many observers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This account of the final period of the decade\r\n\r\nwill describe how our economy grew in the last four\r\n\r\nyears  and  will attempt to give some  reasons  for\r\n\r\nsuch growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the post-Malaysia period, Singapore's Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic  Product  increased at a  compound  annual\r\n\r\nrate of 12.3 per cent as compared with 6.5 per cent\r\n\r\nduring  Malaysia  and  8.1 per  cent  pre-Malaysia.\r\n\r\nTrade,  industry  and  tourism  provided  the  main\r\n\r\nthrust  to our economic growth during this  period.\r\n\r\nThe  result  of  robust economic expansion  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   finances  was   gratifying.   Annual\r\n\r\nrevenue increased from $508 million to $934 million\r\n\r\nlast  year  with but minor adjustments in  taxation\r\n\r\nrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for expansion during this period\r\n\r\nstemmed  from external as well as domestic sources.\r\n\r\nAs  regards the first, what undoubtedly helped most\r\n\r\nwas  the  strong position of the economies  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States,  Europe and Japan.  Notwithstanding\r\n\r\nrecurring  monetary crises during  the  last  three\r\n\r\nyears  of  the  decade,  the  1960s  saw  what  was\r\n\r\nvirtually  a  long sustained boom  among  the  rich\r\n\r\nnations. One after another, they reached conditions\r\n\r\nof  full  employment and had to depend for  further\r\n\r\nexpansion either on imported labour, as happened in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  Germany  and, to  a  lesser  extent,\r\n\r\nBritain,  or  they  had  to  move  some  of   their\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   operations  abroad,   as   happened\r\n\r\nparticularly  with  the United  States  and,  to  a\r\n\r\nlesser extent, Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were also assisted by conditions in Hong Kong\r\n\r\nwhere,  as a result of growth at an extremely  fast\r\n\r\nrate,  tight employment conditions became  apparent\r\n\r\nin  the  last two or three years. Hong Kong,  whose\r\n\r\nwage levels used to be substantially below those of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  ceased to be a provider  of  labour  to\r\n\r\nforeign investors at cheaper rates than Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, the end of confrontation brought\r\n\r\nabout  a resumption of Indonesian trade. This  gave\r\n\r\nthe  first  year  on our own the  main  impetus  to\r\n\r\neconomic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside conditions were favourable. But this by\r\n\r\nitself  did  not ensure our prosperity if  we  were\r\n\r\nunprepared  to  make the effort  required  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  our opportunities. Fortunately,  the\r\n\r\ninstitutions  which were established  as  early  as\r\n\r\n1961  had developed in experience and expertise.  I\r\n\r\nam,   of   course,   referring  to   the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board which was the Government's  main\r\n\r\nagency  for promoting industrial growth. Industrial\r\n\r\nestates at Jurong and elsewhere had provided a wide\r\n\r\nrange of industrial sites to meet every conceivable\r\n\r\ndemand of industry. The Development Bank was  amply\r\n\r\nsupplied  with  funds  and  the  E.D.B.'s  overseas\r\n\r\npromotion  officers improved in skill and  efficacy\r\n\r\nin  their efforts to attract large corporations  to\r\n\r\nthe Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but by no means least, the Employment Act\r\n\r\npassed  in  August 1968, with the  support  of  the\r\n\r\nNational  Trades Union Congress, gave an impressive\r\n\r\ndemonstration of the will of the people to overcome\r\n\r\nall  obstacles  to  make temporary  sacrifices  the\r\n\r\nbetter to secure the future for themselves. Perhaps\r\n\r\nmore   than  anything  else,  the  Employment   Act\r\n\r\nprojected   an  image  of  Singapore  among   large\r\n\r\npotential  foreign investors, of a disciplined  and\r\n\r\nrational people upon whom they could depend for the\r\n\r\nsuccess of their enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these favourable external and internal\r\n\r\ninfluences,  except for the year 1967, the  economy\r\n\r\nmoved  ahead  briskly. The Gross  Domestic  Product\r\n\r\nincreased substantially, details of which  are  set\r\n\r\nout in Table 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                      TABLE 2\r\n\r\n             Gross Domestic Product at\r\n\r\n                Factor Cost 1966-69\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             ($ Million)          Increase\r\n\r\n    1966        3,365               10.6%\r\n\r\n    1967        3,617                7.5%\r\n\r\n    1968        4,257               17.7%\r\n\r\n    1969        4,833               13.5%\r\n\r\n</pre>       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>The 1969 figure is  based on preliminary estimates\r\n\r\nand it is likely that the final estimates would\r\n\r\nshow a larger figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expansion in 1966 derived its impetus principally\r\n\r\nfrom  a resumption of trade with Indonesia as  well\r\n\r\nas  a  general increase in world trade. In absolute\r\n\r\nterms, the earnings of the entrepot trade increased\r\n\r\nfrom $305.6 million to $377.0 million in 1966.  The\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industry provided a useful  gain  of\r\n\r\nsome  $72  million  in  value  added,  from  $414.3\r\n\r\nmillion to $486.8 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good start the Republic made in 1966 was not\r\n\r\nsustained  the following year, which registered  an\r\n\r\nincrease of only 7.5 per cent. The principal reason\r\n\r\nfor   this   was  a  temporary  decline  in   world\r\n\r\nprosperity. World trade which before that year  had\r\n\r\nbeen  growing annually at between 8.4 per cent  and\r\n\r\n11.9 per cent in the previous four years, showed  a\r\n\r\ngrowth  of only 5.4 per cent in 1967. Our  entrepot\r\n\r\nearnings in 1967 showed a very small increase, just\r\n\r\nover one per cent on the previous year. At the same\r\n\r\ntime there was a marked decline in British military\r\n\r\nexpenditure from $549.5 million to $489.9  million.\r\n\r\nThe experience of 1967 is pertinent because the two\r\n\r\nelements making for the slowing down of our  growth\r\n\r\n- reduced military expenditure at the British  bases\r\n\r\nand  levelling off of world trade - are  prospects which face us in the next three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two years of the decade were\r\n\r\nexceptionally  good  for Singapore.  The  principal\r\n\r\nthrust   was  an  unparalleled  expansion  of   our\r\n\r\nentrepot   trade,  earnings  of  which  more   than\r\n\r\ndoubled.  Buoyant  world  trade  conditions  during\r\n\r\n1968-69  helped  sustain our own growth  of  trade.\r\n\r\nWorld trade in these two years increased by 11  per\r\n\r\ncent and 14 per cent. At the same time, earnings in\r\n\r\nthe   manufacturing  industry  showed   substantial\r\n\r\nincreases - 19.2 per cent in 1968 and 22.9 per cent\r\n\r\nin  1969.  The  contribution of  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries  to  the Gross Domestic Product  reached\r\n\r\n$827  million  in  1969 compared  to  a  mere  $170\r\n\r\nmillion  a decade ago. The effect of this expansion\r\n\r\non employment will be discussed later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expansion of trade and industry was more than\r\n\r\nenough to offset the modest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreduction in British military expenditure. In  1967\r\n\r\nthis  amounted to $489.9 million and it was reduced\r\n\r\nto  $415.4 million by 1969. We should remember that\r\n\r\nas  from  now  British military  spending  will  be\r\n\r\nreduced  at  a much faster rate. Between  1967  and\r\n\r\n1969,  quite  apart from expansion of manufacturing\r\n\r\nand   trade,  even  the  tourist  trade   increased\r\n\r\nsufficiently  fast  to offset the  reduced  British\r\n\r\nmilitary  spending, so that increased  earnings  on\r\n\r\ntrade  and  industry virtually formed net additions\r\n\r\nto the domestic product. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier I have referred to total investment which\r\n\r\nincreased  throughout  the  decade  not   only   in\r\n\r\nabsolute  terms  but also as a  proportion  of  the\r\n\r\nGross  Domestic  Product.

The explanation lies in the substantial\r\n\r\npurchases of ships and aircraft in these two years.\r\n\r\nPurchases  of  ships  in  1968  amounted  to  $30.2\r\n\r\nmillion   and  in  1969  to  $56.5  million.   This\r\n\r\ndevelopment fits into the general picture of  sharp\r\n\r\nincreases in entrepot trade during these two  years\r\n\r\nagainst  the background of burgeoning world  trade.\r\n\r\nIn 1969, purchases of ships included the four ships\r\n\r\nbought by the Republic's newly-established national\r\n\r\nshipping line, the Neptune Orient Lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ships accounted for in these figures did not\r\n\r\ninclude,  as  far  as  could be ascertained,  ships\r\n\r\nregistered  under  the  flag-of-convenience   terms\r\n\r\nprovided  for  in  the  revised  Merchant  Shipping\r\n\r\nOrdinance passed in Parliament towards the  end  of\r\n\r\nlast  year.  Future calculations of  Gross  Capital\r\n\r\nFormation would have to draw a distinction  between\r\n\r\nSingapore-registered ships whose beneficial  owners\r\n\r\nare  residents in the Republic and those registered\r\n\r\nfor  flag-of-convenience purposes. This distinction\r\n\r\nis by no means easy to make in all cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards aircraft purchases, the Malaysia-Singapore Airline's aircraft renewal and expansion\r\n\r\nprogrammes  commenced in 1968, when  deliveries  of\r\n\r\nthe  new Boeings took place. New aircraft delivered\r\n\r\nin  1968 and placed in the Singapore Registry  were\r\n\r\nvalued  at  $59.4 million. In 1969,  $37.7  million\r\n\r\nworth  of new aircraft were delivered. Half of  the\r\n\r\nnew  M.S.A. fleet carry Malaysian registration  and\r\n\r\nthese are not included in the above figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other noteworthy feature of the investment\r\n\r\nprocess  in  these  four years was  the  large  but\r\n\r\nregular  increases in expenditure on buildings  and\r\n\r\nworks.  As  against this, expenditure on  machinery\r\n\r\nand  equipment remained level during 1966 and  1967\r\n\r\nand  took  two large steps in 1968 and  1969.  This\r\n\r\nreflects  the  recent  increase  in  the  pace   of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  with  which  most  of   us   are\r\n\r\nfamiliar.  This  increase  is  also  reflected   in\r\n\r\nemployment figures, to which I now turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget Address of 5th December, 1967,\r\n\r\nafter quoting figures of employment as reported  in\r\n\r\nthe  annual  census  of manufactures,  I  made  the\r\n\r\nfollowing observations [Vol. 26, No. 8, col. 453]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is a sobering thought that with the\r\n\r\nprodigious  efforts we put in and the vast  amounts\r\n\r\nof  money  and  resources which the Government  had\r\n\r\nbeen  channelling towards increasing the growth  of\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing industries, all  that  had  been\r\n\r\nachieved is a net increase of some 5,000 jobs  each\r\n\r\nyear  in  these industries. Clearly  this  rate  of\r\n\r\nincrease is inadequate to meet our future needs.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happily, performance since then has improved and\r\n\r\nI  give  the  following employment figures  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing industries from 1966 to 1969:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                     1966 - 51,272\r\n\r\n                     1967 - 56,762\r\n\r\n                     1968 - 72,603\r\n\r\n                     1969 - 87,128\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two years employment in the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing industries has been increasing at  an\r\n\r\nannual rate of around 15,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more in keeping with what we need. In\r\n\r\nfact,  taking  into  account  that  the  stepped-up\r\n\r\nemployment in industry coincided with the intake of\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen  into the  Armed  Forces,  the\r\n\r\nresult  had  been  a  tight  labour  market,   more\r\n\r\nespecially in the professional and skilled  grades,\r\n\r\nwhere shortages in certain lines were acute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to deal with the very rapid\r\n\r\nincreases  in  our official overseas  assets  which\r\n\r\ngrew from $631 million in 1965 to $2,445 million at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  1969. An increase of this proportion,\r\n\r\nabout  four  times in four years, is not  a  common\r\n\r\noccurrence in the monetary history of nations. This\r\n\r\ngrowth  in  our  overseas assets  was  not  due  to\r\n\r\nfinancial  wizardry. It was firstly the  result  of\r\n\r\ninstitutional  changes in note  issue  arrangements\r\n\r\nafter independence;\r\n\r\nsecondly, the consequence of the financial policies\r\n\r\nwe   followed  as  an  independent  Republic;   and\r\n\r\nthirdly,  the  reflection  of  the  rapid  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth I have just described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three components to the increase of our\r\n\r\noverseas assets. The first is the establishment  of\r\n\r\nour  own  currency and the transfer of assets  from\r\n\r\nthe  old Malayan Currency Board to our own Currency\r\n\r\nBoard  when the old notes were exchanged  for  new.\r\n\r\nThe assets of the Currency Board at the end of 1969\r\n\r\namounted  to  $645.37 million. The  second  element\r\n\r\narose  out  of a large increase in commercial  bank\r\n\r\ndeposits.   As  a  result  of  economic  expansion,\r\n\r\nfavourable trade balance and, possibly, some inflow\r\n\r\nof  'hot  money', bank deposits more  than  doubled\r\n\r\nsince  1965,  increasing from $1,222.0  million  to\r\n\r\n$2,745.3  million  in  1969.  The  Government  sold\r\n\r\nTreasury bills to commercial banks and the  holding\r\n\r\nof  such  bills  at  the end of  1969  was  $500.13\r\n\r\nmillion compared with $23.07 million at the end  of\r\n\r\n1965.  As  the  proceeds  of  Treasury  bills  were\r\n\r\ninvested   abroad,   this   had   the   effect   of\r\n\r\nneutralising  a good part of the increase  in  bank\r\n\r\ndeposits  and in this way, helped to avert possible\r\n\r\ninflationary  pressure. The  remainder,  some  $696\r\n\r\nmillion,  represented  the accumulation  of  annual\r\n\r\nGovernment surpluses since 1965 as well as those of\r\n\r\nthe  statutory authorities to the extent that  they\r\n\r\nwere invested in Government securities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ordinary circumstances, it is not necessary to\r\n\r\nhold  such  large assets overseas, which is  really\r\n\r\ntantamount to investing our money abroad instead of\r\n\r\ninvesting  it in the Republic itself. However,  for\r\n\r\nreasons  which I shall go into later, these  assets\r\n\r\nmay come in useful when possible economic trends in\r\n\r\nthe  next  three years may require us to  run  down\r\n\r\nthese assets from their present rather high levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be the right note on which to end\r\n\r\nthis narrative of the decade. We started it with  a\r\n\r\ngrave and persisting problem of unemployment fueled\r\n\r\neach  year by successive floods of post-war  babies\r\n\r\ncoming of age. Our difficulties were compounded  by\r\n\r\nirresponsible  actions of trade unions  manipulated\r\n\r\nfor political ends. We sought a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsolution in a Common Market in Malaysia that proved\r\n\r\na  dead  end.  Throughout the decade  there  was  a\r\n\r\npersistent   search  for  practical  solutions,   a\r\n\r\npatient   building  of  institutions   and   infra-structure,  a  generous  allocation  of  funds,  an\r\n\r\naccumulated  collection of talented staff.  In  the\r\n\r\nend,  it paid off. It is imperative that we  should\r\n\r\nnever, either through extravagance or carelessness,\r\n\r\nfritter  away all that we had so laboriously  built\r\n\r\nup.   We  must  build  on  the  foundation  of  the\r\n\r\naccumulated  experience of the  decade  and  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  progress  and  prosperity  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nhigher levels of consolidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I turn to suggest some policies that could\r\n\r\nhelp  to achieve this, I wish to turn to the  more\r\n\r\nmundane and immediate task of the budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure, 1970-71</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first turn to the Estimates of Revenue and\r\n\r\nExpenditure   for  the  financial   year   1970-71.\r\n\r\nFollowing the practice introduced last year, I have\r\n\r\npresented  to Parliament two Treasury papers*,  one on  the  Ordinary Estimates and the  other  on  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates. These explain  the  reasons\r\n\r\nfor  increased  expenditure, and  forecast  revenue\r\n\r\nyields  in  the  forthcoming  financial  year.  The\r\n\r\nTreasury   papers  also  deal  with   revenue   and\r\n\r\nexpenditure  performances  in  1969.  It   is   not\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  me to enter into  great  detail  of\r\n\r\nitemised  allocations of money to  heads,  subheads\r\n\r\nand items of expenditure, nor need I go through the\r\n\r\nyield  forecast of different classes and  items  of\r\n\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* Papers Parl. Misc. 1 and 2 of 1970.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only necessary for me to set out in broad\r\n\r\noutline  the  policy adopted by the  Government  in\r\n\r\nframing  the  budget for the forthcoming  financial\r\n\r\nyear  and  to  draw attention to some of  the  more\r\n\r\nsignificant expenditure items both in the  Ordinary\r\n\r\nand the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy this year follows the same lines as\r\n\r\nthose  laid down at the last Budget. The  needs  of\r\n\r\ndefence are taken\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas given datum. What remains of anticipated revenue\r\n\r\nyields  is distributed to the other sectors of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  services. As was the  case  last  year,\r\n\r\ncare had to be taken in limiting expenditure on the\r\n\r\nsocial  services  to the most essential  functions.\r\n\r\nConsequently,  the increase of expenditure  on  the\r\n\r\nsocial  services is the smallest of the  four  main\r\n\r\nfunctional  divisions. There  is  a  9.3  per  cent\r\n\r\nincrease  from  $292.0 million in  1969  to  $319.2\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic services that are essential to the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of the momentum of growth were provided\r\n\r\nwith  adequate funds. Taken as a group,  the  money\r\n\r\nvoted  for this division increased by no less  than\r\n\r\n25.1 per cent from $87.1 million for 1969 to $109.0\r\n\r\nmillion in the next financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the real increase is far less than\r\n\r\nthis,  as  certain expenditures  that  used  to  be\r\n\r\nfinanced out of the Development Estimates  are,  in\r\n\r\nthe  coming financial year, charged to the Ordinary\r\n\r\nEstimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence and internal security take the largest\r\n\r\nportion  of the budgetary cake, no less  than  31.7\r\n\r\nper  cent. The money to be supplied to Defence  has\r\n\r\nlong  been  pre-determined by the  revised  Defence\r\n\r\nPlan  which  I described in detail in  last  year's\r\n\r\nBudget.  The  defence plans had to be revised  when\r\n\r\nthe  British  Government advanced the date  of  the\r\n\r\nclosure of their bases to 31st December, 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a substantial increase of $52.1 million\r\n\r\nin  respect of statutory expenditure. This  is  due\r\n\r\nprincipally  to additional provisions for  interest\r\n\r\npayments   and   sinking  fund  contributions.   An\r\n\r\nincrease  of  $1.5  million  results  from  pension\r\n\r\nincreases   due   to  the  salaries   consolidation\r\n\r\nexercise carried out last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I rise and ask the House\r\n\r\nfor  a  brief  adjournment, as  my  colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, would be grateful for  a  few\r\n\r\nminutes' break.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

However, there is a reduction of\r\n\r\n$158,120 for the Bases Economic Conversion\r\n\r\nDepartment as a result of more accurate assessment\r\n\r\nof the needs of that department.

Of the increase of\r\n\r\n$35.8 million, $10 million results from increasing\r\n\r\nthe transfer to the Development Fund from $30\r\n\r\nmillion to $40 million. An additional $2.0 million\r\n\r\ngoes to a new electronic computer for the Ministry,\r\n\r\nand $1.8 million is set aside for the Population\r\n\r\nCensus next June.

Grants to aided schools increase  by\r\n\r\n$5.0  million as a result of salaries consolidation\r\n\r\nand annual increments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four institutions of higher learning, Ngee\r\n\r\nAnn  College,  Nanyang  University,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic, and the University of Singapore,  will\r\n\r\nreceive an increase in grants by an amount of  $3.9\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications, which looks after\r\n\r\npolicy on essential services to the economy by  way\r\n\r\nof air and sea communications as well as postal and\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  services,  receives   a   modest\r\n\r\nincrease  of  $825,000  or  1.9  per  cent.   Civil\r\n\r\nAviation gets a large part of this, by way  of  new\r\n\r\nstaff  and facilities. A sum of $150,000 is to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  public utility charges which will be  incurred\r\n\r\nas  a  result  of  the  new cargo  complex  at  the\r\n\r\nAirport,  the  instrument landing systems  and  the\r\n\r\ntaxi-way  and approach lights. New baggage handling\r\n\r\nequipment,  including  four  tractors  and   eleven\r\n\r\ntrolleys,  will cost $65,500. There are also  staff\r\n\r\nincreases  in  the  Meteorological  Services,   the\r\n\r\nPostal  Services, the Telecommunications Department\r\n\r\nand  the  Marine Department. Demand for  all  these\r\n\r\nservices increases with economic growth and  it  is\r\n\r\nthe   policy  of  the  Ministry  to  maintain  high\r\n\r\nstandards of efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already referred to the increased\r\n\r\nallocation  to  the Ministry of  the  Interior  and\r\n\r\nDefence  and  no further elaboration  is  required.\r\n\r\nApart from the expansion of the armed forces, it is\r\n\r\nalso   necessary  to  strengthen  the   Immigration\r\n\r\nservice.  At the same time, the Ministry had  found\r\n\r\nit  possible to delete a total of 508 posts  mainly\r\n\r\nof  Police  grades, thereby saving some  $1.1  mill\r\n\r\nion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditures by the Ministries of Culture and\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs have been kept within bounds.  They\r\n\r\nshow  a  reduction in expenditure of  $425,000  and\r\n\r\n$1.17  million respectively. The saving  in  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  is principally due to a decrease of  $1.45\r\n\r\nmillion needed by way of public assistance and  the\r\n\r\ntuberculosis treatment allowance. No doubt this  is\r\n\r\nthe result of better housing, more employment and a\r\n\r\nbetter health environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is little change in the Ministry of Labour.\r\n\r\nThe  closure  of the Second Industrial  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt,  made possible by improved labour-management\r\n\r\nrelations, provides adequate savings to meet annual\r\n\r\nincreases and some small staff increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Law and National Development gets\r\n\r\na  modest increase of $3.0 million, or 6.7 per cent\r\n\r\non   the   1969  vote  of  $44.6  million.  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  continues  to  expand  its  staff   and\r\n\r\nservices.  The abattoir in Jurong needs more  staff\r\n\r\nand  so  does the Car Parks Division. The Fisheries\r\n\r\nSection  of  Primary  Production  has  been   given\r\n\r\n$909,000 as back payment of rent to the Jurong Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  for  the  Jurong  Fisheries  Port  and\r\n\r\nCentral  Auction  Market. But  the  main  increases\r\n\r\nrequired  by  the Ministry of National  Development\r\n\r\nare  in  respect  of  public works.  An  additional\r\n\r\n$400,000  has  been  provided  to  keep  government\r\n\r\noffices,  buildings and grounds in good  condition,\r\n\r\nas  well as to maintain properties taken over  from\r\n\r\nthe  British Armed Forces. There is a small saving\r\n\r\nfrom  the  present  policy  of  dismantling  public\r\n\r\nstandpipes  and  providing  domestic  water  supply\r\n\r\ndirect to homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health gets a substantial\r\n\r\nincrease of $6.4 million. More than a third of this\r\n\r\nrepresents annual increment of salaries  and  other\r\n\r\nadditional  payments to staff. However, there  will\r\n\r\nbe  an increase in the volume of services provided.\r\n\r\nA  total of 121 new posts will be provided  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Health Division of the Ministry, 68  to  be\r\n\r\ndeployed in environmental\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhealth,  33 in school health services and the  rest\r\n\r\nelsewhere. More money is also to be spent on public\r\n\r\ncleansing,  maintenance of drains in the  catchment\r\n\r\nareas,   supervision  of  hawkers  and  such   like\r\n\r\nservices.  A total of 110 new refuse vehicles  have\r\n\r\nbeen  or will soon be supplied to the Ministry  and\r\n\r\nthey  will  require  an  increase  of  $240,000  on\r\n\r\nmaintenance expenditure. A substantial increase  in\r\n\r\nanti-mosquito  activities will cost  $\u00be  million.\r\n\r\nThe  years  ahead  will  see further  expansion  in\r\n\r\nenvironmental health control. There is likely to be\r\n\r\nvery substantial capital and re-current expenditure\r\n\r\non   garbage  disposal.  New  policies  are   being\r\n\r\ndeveloped  in the Ministry not only to  improve  on\r\n\r\nexisting  services  but also  introduce  new  ones,\r\n\r\nparticularly  to combat the growing menace  of  air\r\n\r\nand   water  pollution.  The  experience  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries  and other cities indicates that  we  are\r\n\r\nwell  advised  to take measures in advance  of  the\r\n\r\ndeterioration  to  such proportions  that  remedies\r\n\r\nbecome  very  costly. A committee is  investigating\r\n\r\nand    identifying   those   areas    of    medical\r\n\r\nspecialisation in which Singapore could achieve pre-eminence  by providing available medical  expertise\r\n\r\nwith the latest in equipment and facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Development Estimates, 1970-71</i>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Estimates provide for a sum of\r\n\r\n$438.5  million.  This is roughly  divided  in  two\r\n\r\nequal   portions  -  one  of  $215.6  million   for\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  government  development  projects,\r\n\r\nwhile  a  sum  of $222.9 million is set  aside  for\r\n\r\nloans to statutory authorities and government-owned\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major part of direct government expenditure\r\n\r\nis  spent  by  the  Ministry of  Law  and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment. The budget provision for this Ministry\r\n\r\nis  $95.65  million. The major schemes administered\r\n\r\nby  this  Ministry  include the  Bedok  reclamation\r\n\r\nscheme,   the  Kallang  Basin  reclamation  scheme,\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  roads and bridges,  drainage  and\r\n\r\nflood  alleviation  schemes, as  well  as  sewerage\r\n\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bedok reclamation scheme has been proceeding\r\n\r\nwell,  some 1,000 acres having been recovered  from\r\n\r\nthe sea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  a  cost of $43 million so far, and another  $11\r\n\r\nmillion  will  be required in 1970-71.  The  second\r\n\r\nphase  of  this large land reclamation scheme  will\r\n\r\ncover  125  acres  of  land between  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nSwimming Club to the end of Tanjong Rhu. A  further\r\n\r\n165  acres  along  Nicoll  Highway  will  also   be\r\n\r\nreclaimed  at  a  total cost of $24.9  million,  of\r\n\r\nwhich  $8.3  million is expected  to  be  spent  in\r\n\r\n1970-71.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kallang Basin reclamation scheme is 80 per\r\n\r\ncent  complete,  399  acres  of  land  having  been\r\n\r\nreclaimed  at  a cost of $22.9 million.  A  further\r\n\r\n$2.6  million is required next year to reclaim  the\r\n\r\nremaining 93 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urban renewal is expected to cost $15.6 million\r\n\r\nin   1970-71.   The  first  phase,  rebuilding   in\r\n\r\nCrawford,  Sepoy Lines and Havelock  constituencies\r\n\r\non  270  acres of land has been completed with  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of 2,500 flats and 800 shops.  Another\r\n\r\n950  flats and 97 shops are nearing completion. The\r\n\r\nUrban Renewal Department will need $1.9 million  by\r\n\r\nway  of  salaries  and  wages  while  another  $\u00bc\r\n\r\nmillion will go as Government's contribution to the\r\n\r\nUnited Nations State and City Planning project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary Production is forging ahead with\r\n\r\nambitious development schemes costing $2.5 million.\r\n\r\nAnimal  husbandry  projects alone  will  cost  $1.0\r\n\r\nmillion.  This  includes a revote of  $300,000  for\r\n\r\ncompletion of the Jurong abattoir, and $500,000 for\r\n\r\nthe   pig   and   poultry  training  and   research\r\n\r\ninstitute.  Among agricultural projects,  work  has\r\n\r\nstarted  on  developing hydroponics farming,  while\r\n\r\nthe  farm  licensing and collection of agricultural\r\n\r\nstatistics accounts for $150,000. Fisheries will be\r\n\r\nprovided with more than $\u00bd million; most of it is\r\n\r\nfor  training of fishermen. It is to be hoped  that\r\n\r\nthis   massive   injection  of   funds   into   the\r\n\r\nagricultural  sector will result in an  improvement\r\n\r\non  the  anaemic performance of 2.9 per cent growth\r\n\r\nrate in the last decade, the lowest growth rate  of\r\n\r\nany sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on roads and bridges is expected to\r\n\r\namount to $13.3 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrainage  and  flood alleviation will cost  another\r\n\r\n$4.2  million. This includes the cost of completing\r\n\r\nthe   first   phase  of  the  Bukit   Timah   flood\r\n\r\nalleviation project for a sum of $2.3 million.  The\r\n\r\ntotal  cost  of this phase, which will drain  flood\r\n\r\nwaters from the Bukit Timah Canal to the Ulu Pandan\r\n\r\nRiver through a canal which runs into a tunnel  cut\r\n\r\nunder a hill, amounts to $6.84 million, spent  over\r\n\r\nfour years. Canals and subsidiary drains in various\r\n\r\nparts  of  the  Island will be lined with  concrete\r\n\r\nand,  with  minor drainage schemes, will cost  some\r\n\r\n$1.9 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sewerage development continues apace, and a sum\r\n\r\nof  $12.1  million is provided under  Head  97  for\r\n\r\nthis.    Major   sewerage   projects   are    under\r\n\r\nconstruction  at  the  Kallang  Basin,   Serangoon,\r\n\r\nJurong,  Thomson Road, Urban Renewal  North,  Urban\r\n\r\nRenewal  South,  Bartley  Road  and  Upper   Changi\r\n\r\nEstate.  In  addition to these nine  major  schemes\r\n\r\nwhich  cost $7.2 million, there will be three major\r\n\r\nsewage  treatment and disposal works for  extension\r\n\r\nor  construction at a cost of $3.2  million.  There\r\n\r\nwill  also  be miscellaneous projects costing  $1.7\r\n\r\nmillion.  Most of these schemes will see completion\r\n\r\nin the financial year 1971-72.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health will be spending $2.6\r\n\r\nmillion  on  Public Health services.  $1.6  million\r\n\r\nwill  be  spent  in buying 55 new refuse-collecting\r\n\r\nvehicles. New cleansing and night-soil depots  will\r\n\r\nbe  established at a cost of $678,000.  There  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  development of hospital services  costing\r\n\r\nnearly a million dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications has important\r\n\r\ndevelopment  projects  under  way.  The   passenger\r\n\r\nterminal  at  Paya Lebar will be redeveloped  at  a\r\n\r\ncost  of  $5 million, of which $3 million  will  be\r\n\r\nspent in 1970-71. It is expected to be completed by\r\n\r\nthe end of next year. The existing jet and terminal\r\n\r\nparking   aprons  will  be  extended   to   relieve\r\n\r\ncongestion, at a cost of $1.3 million.

The  Government proposes  to  extend  the\r\n\r\nrunway now 11,000 feet long to 13,200 feet long. It\r\n\r\nwill also construct a new cargo terminal and a  new\r\n\r\nhangar large enough to accommodate the Boeing  747.\r\n\r\nOnly  token provisions, however, have been  entered\r\n\r\nin the coming financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star item in the Ministry's development\r\n\r\nprogramme   is  undoubtedly  the  earth   satellite\r\n\r\nstation   for  which  some  $10  million  will   be\r\n\r\nrequired.  It  is also necessary to buy  additional\r\n\r\nteleprinter machines and telex machines, demand for\r\n\r\nwhich  has  exceeded supply by a wide  margin.  The\r\n\r\nnational  auto telex exchange will be improved  and\r\n\r\nnew  micro-wave  radio bearers for the  main  trunk\r\n\r\nsystem  will be introduced. The total bill for  all\r\n\r\nthese is expected to be $15.2 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteorological services will be provided with\r\n\r\nup-to-date equipment, including wind-finding  radar\r\n\r\nand a replacement for the storm-warning radar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Interior and Defence will\r\n\r\nneed  $51.4 million, mostly for works and buildings\r\n\r\nand  land  acquisition, to house  the  new  defence\r\n\r\nunits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will be provided with\r\n\r\n$22.1  million  for development projects  of  which\r\n\r\nthere  is  a long list. Most of these projects  are\r\n\r\nfor  the  advancement of technical  education.  The\r\n\r\nTechnical Education Department of the Ministry  has\r\n\r\nintroduced  workshops in academic schools  so  that\r\n\r\nall   secondary  school  students  will  have  some\r\n\r\nexperience of workshop practices. In addition,  the\r\n\r\nconversion  of  academic schools into academic-cum-technical  schools  and  conversion  of   the   old\r\n\r\nvocational  schools  into  industrial  centres  are\r\n\r\nproceeding as scheduled. Four vocational institutes\r\n\r\nare  under construction or extension and a new  one\r\n\r\nat MacPherson will soon commence construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on academic education consists mostly\r\n\r\nof  continuing  projects. However, a  new  building\r\n\r\nwill be provided for Raffles Institution at Grange\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoad.  Earth-works have begun on a 14.2  acre  site\r\n\r\nand the building is expected to be completed by the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of  next  year.  The  total  cost  is  $2.4\r\n\r\nmillion. There will be 28 class-rooms, two lecture-halls, seven workshops, eight science laboratories,\r\n\r\na  library,  an  assembly hall,  a  gymnasium,  and\r\n\r\nancillary rooms for extra-curricular activities. In\r\n\r\naddition, there will be a large sports field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Ministry of Labour's development\r\n\r\nprojects, a Hotel and Catering Training School will\r\n\r\ncost  $2.2 million. It is hoped to provide training\r\n\r\nfor some 1,000 trainees a year when completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Science and Technology proposes\r\n\r\nto  build a Popular Science Centre. This will  give\r\n\r\ncitizens  a  better understanding  of  what  modern\r\n\r\nscience  is  about;  it  will  also  be  useful  to\r\n\r\nsecondary  school science students and  others.  In\r\n\r\naddition, the National Museum will be improved  and\r\n\r\nextended  at  a  cost  of $300,000.  It  is  public\r\n\r\nknowledge that the Government proposes to move  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore from its present campus  to\r\n\r\nKent  Ridge. A sum of $500,000 is set aside to meet\r\n\r\nthe cost of planning the new university campus. The\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank has expressed an interest in  providing\r\n\r\nfinance for the cost of university development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in many years, the Judicature\r\n\r\nappears  in the Development Estimates. This  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide    Subordinate    Courts    with     decent\r\n\r\naccommodation.  They are now scattered  at  various\r\n\r\nplaces   along  South  Bridge  Road,  Sepoy  Lines,\r\n\r\nEmpress Place, New Bridge Road and Outram Road. The\r\n\r\nChief  Justice tells me that some of the  buildings\r\n\r\nare  not  only old and dilapidated but a danger  to\r\n\r\ntheir occupants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Court building will be erected at Havelock\r\n\r\nRoad to house 55 odd-rooms, chambers for judges and\r\n\r\nmagistrates,  waiting-rooms, witnesses'  rooms  and\r\n\r\nother paraphernalia required for the administration\r\n\r\nof justice.

The Housing and Development Board  will\r\n\r\nbe  provided with a loan of $100 million to finance\r\n\r\nits  accelerated building programme. Hitherto,  the\r\n\r\nannual  loan provision stood at $50 million. Jurong\r\n\r\nTown Corporation has some $50 million set aside and\r\n\r\nthis  money will pay for reclamation of swamp  land\r\n\r\nat the old West Coast Road, the extension of Jurong\r\n\r\nWharf,  construction of workers' flats  and  social\r\n\r\namenities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Stadium, the foundation-stone of\r\n\r\nwhich I was privileged to lay a fortnight ago, will\r\n\r\nbe  offered a loan of $7.8 million. It is  intended\r\n\r\nto  form  a  Corporation to run  the  Stadium.  The\r\n\r\nincome to repay this loan, as well as future loans,\r\n\r\nwill  come from two sources. First, the profits  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Pools  (Pte.) Limited and,  second,  the\r\n\r\ntakings at the gate of the Stadium, which one hopes\r\n\r\nwill exceed the cost of maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has embarked on a number of\r\n\r\nenterprises  in  the  business field,  including  a\r\n\r\nshipping  line, a shipbuilding yard, a  ship-repair\r\n\r\nyard,  a  small arms plant and a development  bank.\r\n\r\nThese  require  loan finance and  a  sum  of  $65.1\r\n\r\nmillion has been set aside for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Town Corporation has been charged with\r\n\r\nthe  duty  of developing Blakang Mati, soon  to  be\r\n\r\nrenamed,  and  has commenced work.

Before  I  go  on  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  possible future courses  our  economy  may\r\n\r\ntake,  I should say a few words on taxation policy.\r\n\r\nThe Government's policy in recent years has been to\r\n\r\ndepend on fast economic expansion and improved  tax\r\n\r\nadministration to provide increased revenue  rather\r\n\r\nthan raise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrates of taxation to higher levels or introduce new\r\n\r\ntaxes. Last year, some minor tax increases as  well\r\n\r\nas  new  taxes  were announced to meet  the  rising\r\n\r\nneeds   of  our  defence  build-up.  1969   revenue\r\n\r\nincreased by $131.5 million over 1968. The yield of\r\n\r\nnew   revenue  measures  was  $30.4  million  while\r\n\r\neconomic expansion contributed most of the  balance\r\n\r\nof $101.0 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treasury estimates of tax yields, as set out in\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates and explained in the Treasury paper,\r\n\r\nindicate  that  increasing yields,  resulting  from\r\n\r\neconomic   growth,   will  be  adequate   to   meet\r\n\r\nexpenditure  increases. I therefore do not  propose\r\n\r\nto  raise new taxes, apart from the recent increase\r\n\r\nin  tobacco  duties  to bring  them  in  line  with\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Singapore, contrary to the belief of many\r\n\r\nBackbenchers,  is  a  lightly  taxed  country.  Tax\r\n\r\nrevenues  amount to about 13 per cent of G.N.P.  In\r\n\r\nother countries they are much higher, as much as 30\r\n\r\nper  cent  or more of G.N.P. in some instances.  So\r\n\r\nlong  as  we  maintain a robust  rate  of  economic\r\n\r\nexpansion  and  maintain government expenditure  to\r\n\r\nessentials,  we  need not emulate  the  example  of\r\n\r\nthese highly taxed countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Near Future</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this glad news to the taxpayer out of the\r\n\r\nway,  I  turn  to  look at our  immediate  economic\r\n\r\nprospects.  It is important that we should  not  be\r\n\r\nlulled  into a sense of false security by the  mild\r\n\r\nboom  now  going on. There are dark clouds  on  the\r\n\r\nhorizon, and it is as well that we prepare for more\r\n\r\ndifficult times. The first adverse factor affecting\r\n\r\nour  economy  over the next two years will  be  the\r\n\r\ncompletion  of  the British military withdrawal  by\r\n\r\n31st  December, 1971. In the next three years,  the\r\n\r\neconomy  of  Singapore will feel the  impact  of  a\r\n\r\ndecline of British military expenditure, from  $415\r\n\r\nmillion in 1969 to zero in 1972. There is likely to\r\n\r\nbe a reduction of some $100 million to $150 million\r\n\r\nfor  this  year  and  a final phasing  out  of  the\r\n\r\nremaining  $250  million to $300 million  in  1971.\r\n\r\nWhile no longer the catastrophe we once feared they\r\n\r\nwould be, declines of expenditure of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis magnitude cannot but have an unpleasant impact\r\n\r\non   our  economy.  In  1969,  the  reduction   was\r\n\r\nestimated at some $40 million and was hardly felt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards world trade which, as we have\r\n\r\nrepeatedly    seen,    influences    our    economy\r\n\r\nsignificantly,  it  is  unlikely  to  provide   the\r\n\r\nsubstantial impetus to growth which it did  in  the\r\n\r\nyears  1968  and  1969. In these two  years,  world\r\n\r\ntrade expanded at unprecedented rates, 11 per  cent\r\n\r\nand 14 per cent respectively. There is likely to be\r\n\r\na  slowing down of world trade in 1970. The  extent\r\n\r\nof this is yet uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of this uncertainty derives from the outlook\r\n\r\nof  the  U.S. economy for this year. The  American\r\n\r\neconomy  is so large and powerful that fluctuations\r\n\r\nin   its   level  of  activity  exercise  a  strong\r\n\r\ninfluence on the economies of the rest of the world\r\n\r\noutside  the  Communist bloc.  For  just  over  two\r\n\r\nyears,  the  American administration, in  the  last\r\n\r\nyear  of  President Johnson and the first  year  of\r\n\r\nPresident  Nixon,  has  been  battling   with   the\r\n\r\nproblems   of  domestic  inflation  and   unsettled\r\n\r\nbalance of payments position. The l960s have seen a\r\n\r\nsustained and powerful growth of the U.S. economy,\r\n\r\nthe  G.N.P. increasing from U.S. $503  billion  in\r\n\r\n1960 to U.S. $932 billion in 1969. In the last four\r\n\r\nyears  of  the  decade,  as  the  American  economy\r\n\r\napproached   and   reached  the   level   of   full\r\n\r\nemployment, inflationary pressures began  to  build\r\n\r\nup.  These  pressures became grave,  when  military\r\n\r\nexpenditure in Vietnam was substantially  increased\r\n\r\nas from 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With domestic price inflation there has also\r\n\r\noccurred the inevitable concomitant - a squeeze  on\r\n\r\nthe  balance  of payments. Whereas, throughout  the\r\n\r\n1950s and the first half of the 1960s, the American\r\n\r\nbalance  of  payments on trading account invariably\r\n\r\nshowed  an annual surplus of anything between  U.S.\r\n\r\n$3  billion and $5 billion a year, the last year or\r\n\r\ntwo  has  seen this reduced to very small  amounts,\r\n\r\nquite  inadequate  to support  the  large  overseas\r\n\r\npayments on account of American capital invest-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nments abroad, expenditure by American tourists  and\r\n\r\ngovernment  expenditure  overseas,  including   aid\r\n\r\nfinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since December 1968, the Federal Reserve Board\r\n\r\nhas  begun  a  policy of severe  credit  restraint.\r\n\r\nBecause  of the strength and power of the  American\r\n\r\neconomy,  it  was only in the last few months  that\r\n\r\nthe tight money policy of the Federal Reserve Board\r\n\r\nhas  produced  visible  results.  There  have  been\r\n\r\nsignificant reductions in the volume of  industrial\r\n\r\nproduction,  in the volume of new construction,  in\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  consumer  durables  and  a   small\r\n\r\nincrease   in  unemployment.  Yet  price  inflation\r\n\r\nremains  alarmingly strong, at annual rates  of  54\r\n\r\nper cent to 64 per cent in recent months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the slowing down and even decline in\r\n\r\nseveral   of  the  important  economic  indicators,\r\n\r\ninvestment plans of the large American corporations\r\n\r\nand  in  the  public sector have not  so  far  been\r\n\r\nreduced to the extent needed to dampen inflationary\r\n\r\npressure.  The demand for investable funds  in  the\r\n\r\nface  of  the  tight money policy  of  the  Federal\r\n\r\nReserve  Board has resulted in the rise of interest\r\n\r\nrates to historical heights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic trends in the next twelve months in the\r\n\r\nUnited   States  are  difficult  to  predict.   The\r\n\r\nadministration economists visualise a levelling-off\r\n\r\nof  growth measured in real terms, and increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  rate of unemployment from a low level of  some\r\n\r\n3.3 per cent in some months last year to an average\r\n\r\nlevel  of  4.3 per cent this year, perhaps reaching\r\n\r\n5.0  per cent at the highest level. They do not see\r\n\r\nany  recession  of  significant  proportions.  They\r\n\r\nexpect  price inflation to moderate from the annual\r\n\r\nrate  of 54 per cent last year to around 4 per cent\r\n\r\nor  44  per cent this year. They expect the economy\r\n\r\nto  pick  up  momentum in the second half  of  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scenario, as set out by the administration,\r\n\r\nis  probably the best development one can hope for.\r\n\r\nIf  events  follow the course as predicted  by  the\r\n\r\nAmerican  official  economists,  then  neither  the\r\n\r\nworld of advanced nations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Europe  nor  the  less affluent  underdeveloped\r\n\r\ncountries  need  fear  a marked  decline  in  their\r\n\r\ntrading  positions. GATT (the General Agreement  on\r\n\r\nTariffs  and Trade) predicts that world  trade  may\r\n\r\nincrease this year by between 4 per cent and 8  per\r\n\r\ncent. The O.E.C.D., optimistic as ever, forecasts a\r\n\r\n10  per  cent growth. My own preference is for  the\r\n\r\nGATT  forecast; if the outcome is near  the  higher\r\n\r\npoint  of  the GATT forecast range, there  probably\r\n\r\nwould be no unduly harsh impact on our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if events take a course different from\r\n\r\nthe U.S. official forecasts, it is likely to be for\r\n\r\nthe  worse  rather  than for the better.  Then  the\r\n\r\nnegative   factors  created  by   reduced   British\r\n\r\nmilitary expenditure will be compounded. These  are\r\n\r\nmatters  beyond our control. All we can  do  is  to\r\n\r\ntake  note  of  possible  dangers  looming  on  the\r\n\r\nhorizon and make due preparation for them. I cannot\r\n\r\nbut  underline  my warning against the  dangers  of\r\n\r\ncomplacency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, the next three years may not be as\r\n\r\ngood   as  the  last  two.  Fortunately,  we   have\r\n\r\naccumulated sufficient fat in the good years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Longer-term Perspective</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the longer-term perspective,\r\n\r\nlooking  to  the  mid '70s and beyond.  Unless  the\r\n\r\nstability  of  the area is seriously upset,  it  is\r\n\r\nlikely that we can sustain and even increase the momentum  of  industrial  growth  which  we  recently\r\n\r\nachieved. The Promotion Centres established by  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board in Europe  and  America\r\n\r\nand  Japan have gained good experience in the  last\r\n\r\nfew   years.  Unless  we  see  a  world  depression\r\n\r\ndeveloping  on  some scale - and the consensus  among\r\n\r\nthe   experts   is  that  this  is  an   improbable\r\n\r\neventuality - we shall see in the next  few  years,\r\n\r\nthe  fruition of many industrial projects, some  of\r\n\r\nthem  of  a  size exceeding anything that  we  have\r\n\r\nhitherto  attained. The activities  connected  with\r\n\r\noffshore  oil  exploration in  the  waters  of  the\r\n\r\nArchipelago are likely to give rise to a number  of\r\n\r\ninteresting  manufacturing and  service  industries\r\n\r\nbased in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  problem we are likely to encounter between now\r\n\r\nand  1975,  barring a recession of  course,  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  large numbers and wide  varieties  of\r\n\r\nskills which the new industries will need. In  this\r\n\r\nconnection, we have had the advantage of  a  recent\r\n\r\nstudy  by  Dr Albert Winsemius who led  the  first\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations  mission in 1960  to  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nadvise  on policies on industrial development.  Dr\r\n\r\nWinsemius is an old friend of Singapore; in 1967 he\r\n\r\nwas  awarded the Distinguished Service  Medal.  Dr\r\n\r\nWinsemius  pays regular visits to the Republic,  at\r\n\r\nour request, to check on our economic health and to\r\n\r\ndiscern problems ahead and suggest remedies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He completed his last visit about a month ago.\r\n\r\nHis  prognosis  is  that the shortages  of  skills,\r\n\r\nwhich  we  knew  existed, will become  increasingly\r\n\r\nserious  and  more acute than we had believed.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  his calculations indicate  that  despite\r\n\r\nthe  intention  of the University of  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nincrease the annual output of engineers from 80  at\r\n\r\npresent  to  210 by 1974, the Republic will  remain\r\n\r\nshort  of  engineers over the next  five  years  by\r\n\r\nbetween 450 and 500 each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards management personnel, the output of\r\n\r\naccountants and business management graduates  will\r\n\r\nfall seriously short of requirements, the shortage,\r\n\r\nin  Dr Winsemius' estimate, coming to some  200  a\r\n\r\nyear  over  the  next three years. As  regards  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  technicians, who have to  support  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of engineers, the position is even  worse.\r\n\r\nTaking  into  account  the  large  requirements  of\r\n\r\ntechnicians in the defence forces, we are likely to\r\n\r\nbe short of technicians by 1,500 to 2,000 each year\r\n\r\nover the next two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These estimates are based on the assumption that\r\n\r\nindustrial  growth, now running at between  15  per\r\n\r\ncent and 20 per cent a year, will be sustained over\r\n\r\nthe  next  five years. There is no reason why  this\r\n\r\ncannot be done. By 1974, the industrial work  force\r\n\r\nshould  have  increased  to  around  247,000   men.\r\n\r\nFurther, as much of the increases will accrue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the  establishment of large industrial  units\r\n\r\nrather  than  a  proliferation of small  ones,  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for engineers, and management and technical\r\n\r\npersonnel will be of a different order of magnitude\r\n\r\nfrom  what we have been accustomed to. This,  then,\r\n\r\nwill  be the principal difficulty which we have  to\r\n\r\novercome  - not so much to attract investment  into\r\n\r\nthe   manufacturing  industries   but   to   supply\r\n\r\ninvestors  with  skilled personnel of  all  grades,\r\n\r\nwithout which modern industry cannot operate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it takes four years for an engineering\r\n\r\nstudent  to graduate and several more years  before\r\n\r\nhe  acquires sufficient experience to  be  able  to\r\n\r\nwork  effectively  in an organisation,  clearly  we\r\n\r\ncannot depend on local supply to meet the demand in\r\n\r\nthese  fields. The problem is similar in regard  to\r\n\r\nmanagement  personnel and technical  staff,  though\r\n\r\nhere  local supply, if stepped up immediately,  may\r\n\r\nbe  able  to fill the gap earlier than is  possible\r\n\r\nwith engineers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary, as a matter of high\r\n\r\npriority, that we should relax our immigration  and\r\n\r\nwork permit restrictions on the inflow of personnel\r\n\r\nbelonging  to  the categories I have described.  At\r\n\r\npresent,  they  are given entry  and  work  permits\r\n\r\nprovided they are sponsored by an employer. That is\r\n\r\nto say, they have to find work here before they are\r\n\r\nallowed the necessary permits. It would be a  clear\r\n\r\nadvantage to liberalise the conditions under  which\r\n\r\nsuch   people  can  come  into  Singapore,  acquire\r\n\r\npermanent  residence and eventual  citizenship.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be  useful, for instance, if they  could  be\r\n\r\nallowed  here for any length of time they  wish  so\r\n\r\nthat  they can do the job-hunting and, in this way,\r\n\r\nfit into the best slots available to them. This  is\r\n\r\na matter of great urgency, as it is well known that\r\n\r\na  great  amount of crimping already  takes  place.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Technical Education Department  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education, which has to  train  large\r\n\r\nnumbers  of artisans and craftsmen, are finding  it\r\n\r\ndifficult to retain their engineers and technicians\r\n\r\nwho\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave   to  do  the  training  at  the  Department's\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Training Centres, Vocational Institutes\r\n\r\nand secondary technical schools. -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>University Development</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discussion of the ways in which we should\r\n\r\ntry  to  fill the gap between demand and supply  of\r\n\r\nengineers  leads  me to two related  subjects.  The\r\n\r\nfirst relates to the levels of scientific knowledge\r\n\r\nand   technological  know-how  which   our   future\r\n\r\nindustries   are  likely  to  demand.  The   second\r\n\r\nconcerns  University development  in  Singapore  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  as  well  as  the  output  of  scientists,\r\n\r\nengineers and technicians in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, there has been increasing\r\n\r\nreference  in public as well as private discussions\r\n\r\nto the need for Singapore to develop \"science-based\r\n\r\nand  technology-oriented industries\". A  well-known\r\n\r\nBritish  financial commentator recently  said  that\r\n\r\nwhenever  he hears the phrase \"advanced  industrial\r\n\r\ntechnology\" he reaches for his gun. Too often  this\r\n\r\ncatch  phrase  is used as an attempt to  mulct  the\r\n\r\npublic   purse  of  sizable  subsidies  to  finance\r\n\r\nindustrial research which has no hope of  resulting\r\n\r\nin  commercially feasible -products. I have a great\r\n\r\ndeal  of  sympathy  for  this  position,  but   for\r\n\r\ndifferent  reasons.  The use of  the  term  to  our\r\n\r\nindustries, existing as well as potential, is often\r\n\r\nmisleading.   As   an  -example,  the   electronics\r\n\r\nindustry  in  America  works at  the  frontiers  of\r\n\r\nscience  and technology. The electronic  components\r\n\r\nwe  make  in Singapore probably require less  skill\r\n\r\nthan  that required by barbers or cooks, consisting\r\n\r\nmostly of repetitive manual operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not presume that at the comparatively low\r\n\r\nlevel of scientific and technological know-how that\r\n\r\nwe  find  ourselves today, it is our role to  train\r\n\r\nscientists  and  engineers  who  will   engage   in\r\n\r\nresearch at the frontiers of -knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours should be the more mundane, if practical,\r\n\r\napproach. In the foreseeable future, we are  likely\r\n\r\nto set up those industrial activities which require\r\n\r\nassiduous application of engineering skills\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  workmanship in well-developed  and  well-known\r\n\r\nindustrial  processes in which we  have  a  natural\r\n\r\nadvantage  by  being  able  to  produce  or  import\r\n\r\nengineers,   technicians,  craftsmen  and   skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  capable  of performing the  most  exacting\r\n\r\nstandards of work but at a much lower cost than the\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries could. Even so, the  limitation\r\n\r\nhere  is  that restrictions may be imposed  on  the\r\n\r\nimport  of  quite  a  number of these  products  by\r\n\r\nindustrialised nations which want to  preserve  the\r\n\r\nhome market for their own industries. Further,  not\r\n\r\nall  countries  would favour a policy  whereby  the\r\n\r\ntechniques which they have evolved as a  result  of\r\n\r\nsustained and costly research and development  work\r\n\r\nare   passed   on  to  others.  But   within   such\r\n\r\nlimitations, there could be a wide field to  choose\r\n\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practical application, even at these modest\r\n\r\nlevels   of   technology,  requires  a  substantial\r\n\r\nupgrading  of skills at all levels - from  research\r\n\r\nscientists,    engineers,   technicians,    skilled\r\n\r\ncraftsmen  -to  standards beyond anything  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved  now. It is in this sense that  we  should\r\n\r\ntry  to  improve  our reservoir of  scientific  and\r\n\r\ntechnological knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me naturally to the subject of the\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of   our   Universities   which   are\r\n\r\ninstitutions  to  provide the requisite  people  to\r\n\r\nperform  these tasks. It is one of the  misfortunes\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  that  the  development  of  our  two\r\n\r\nUniversities  has encountered difficulties  in  the\r\n\r\npast  which have stunted their growth. In the  case\r\n\r\nof   Nanyang   University,  the  deterioration   of\r\n\r\nadministration  prior  to  1964  had  allowed   the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the University virtually to  pass  into\r\n\r\nthe hands of student activists who were manipulated\r\n\r\nby  the  Communist United Front. Nanyang University\r\n\r\nvirtually  became a training ground for the  higher\r\n\r\nechelon  cadres  of  the  Communist  United  Front.\r\n\r\nGovernment intervention as a security measure  then\r\n\r\nbecame  inevitable.  Since the restoration  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity's   administration   to   more    normal\r\n\r\nstandards,   improvements  have   been   made   and\r\n\r\nstandards have been raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of the University of Singapore was\r\n\r\ndifferent. Here, until recently and perhaps not even\r\n\r\nthen,  there  appeared to be  a  total  absence  of\r\n\r\nmeaningful dialogue between the University and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. The University, particularly in certain\r\n\r\ndepartments  in  the  Faculty  of  Arts,  in  which\r\n\r\nexpatriate   staff  were  dominant,   viewed   the\r\n\r\nGovernment not as a possible source of support  and\r\n\r\nencouragement,  but  as a potential  danger  and  a\r\n\r\nthreat  to  its autonomy. Trivial incidents,  which\r\n\r\nsometimes  arose as a result of poor communications\r\n\r\nbetween  the two sides, were inflated  out  of  all\r\n\r\nproportion  to their real importance. Part  of  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  seems to stem from the attitudes  of  some\r\n\r\nexpatriate staff who have brought with them  not merely    a   competence   in   their   field    of\r\n\r\nspecialisation  but also contemporary  styles  and\r\n\r\npostures which may be meaningful in the context  of\r\n\r\nstrident  anti-establishment and liberal  postures.\r\n\r\nIn    part,    these    reflect   trends    towards\r\n\r\npermissiveness  and promiscuity  in  the  societies\r\n\r\nfrom which these expatriates came and to which they\r\n\r\nbelong.  But  these are totally irrelevant  to  the\r\n\r\nsituation Singaporeans are facing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of student population as well as the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  expenditures of the two  Universities\r\n\r\nfinanced  from  Government revenues has  failed  to\r\n\r\nkeep  pace  with  the  expansion  of  the  economy.\r\n\r\nEnrolment   at   the  two  Universities   and   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  and  Ngee  Ann College  combined  grew\r\n\r\nduring  the decade from 9,355 to 16,214, a  73  per\r\n\r\ncent  increase  as compared with  a  146  per  cent\r\n\r\nincrease in the Gross Domestic Product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matters had reached such a pass at the University\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  that it was found  necessary  for  a\r\n\r\nCabinet   Minister  to  be  appointed   its   Vice-Chancellor. And yet, it may be that the appointment\r\n\r\nof  my  colleague,  the Minister  for  Science  and\r\n\r\nTechnology,  could  be just the  step  required  to\r\n\r\nrestore  a  relationship of confidence between  the\r\n\r\nUniversity   and  the  Government   so   that   the\r\n\r\nUniversity can develop into an institution more  in\r\n\r\ntune  with the needs of the society which  nurtures\r\n\r\nit. There is welcome evidence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  student body and a growing part  of  the\r\n\r\nacademic staff are becoming aware of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly without his appointment to the post of\r\n\r\nVice-Chancellor, it is unlikely that my  colleagues\r\n\r\nand  I  would  entertain the proposal to  move  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  at  enormous expense from  its  present\r\n\r\nconstricted  campus at Bukit Timah to  one  of  the\r\n\r\nmost  scenic sites in Singapore in the range  of\r\n\r\nhills known as Kent Ridge. Since his appointment as\r\n\r\nVice-Chancellor, it has been increasingly  apparent\r\n\r\nto  the  Government that the University would  need\r\n\r\nmore  funds  not only to expand existing  faculties\r\n\r\nand  establish new ones, but also to  increase  the\r\n\r\npay  of  academic staff to levels which will ensure\r\n\r\nthat they will attract and retain the keenest minds\r\n\r\nproduced in the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvements in similar measure are also\r\n\r\nnecessary   at   the   other  University,   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  Here  the problem will  be,  for  some\r\n\r\nconsiderable  time  to come,  to  recruit  Chinese-speaking   academic  staff  of  calibre  into   the\r\n\r\nUniversity.  While  Nanyang  graduates   who   have\r\n\r\nreturned  from  post-graduate studies  abroad  will\r\n\r\ngrow  in  strength and numbers, there  is  need  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  senior  staff in various disciplines.  The\r\n\r\nfield  of recruitment is much narrower than is  the\r\n\r\ncase  with  the  University of Singapore.  Further,\r\n\r\nmany  of  the best Chinese-speaking scientists  and\r\n\r\nscholars  available today -outside of the  People's\r\n\r\nRepublic   of  China  are  engaged  in   industrial\r\n\r\nresearch or academic teaching in the United  States\r\n\r\nof  America. To attract them to Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nwould be both a complex and expensive exercise, but\r\n\r\nsome  method must be found of doing this if Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity were to develop in stature and repute as\r\n\r\na centre of scholarship and research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have dwelt at some length on University\r\n\r\neducation.  The  subject arose out of  current  and\r\n\r\nprojected  shortages  of engineers  and  management\r\n\r\npersonnel   which   proper   university    training\r\n\r\nprogrammes could in course of time help to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsolve. But universities have a more crucial role in\r\n\r\nthe  development process, if one takes a  long-term\r\n\r\nview  of  it.  Let me set the subject in  its  true\r\n\r\nperspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made long and strenuous efforts to\r\n\r\nattract foreign investment into Singapore, but  not\r\n\r\nbecause  we need the money. The high level  of  our\r\n\r\noverseas assets shows that we have more money  than\r\n\r\nwe  can  usefully  spend in Singapore.  We  welcome\r\n\r\nforeign  investors  for the two things  they  bring\r\n\r\nwith  them  - technology and markets.  If  Singapore\r\n\r\nwere a large country, say, with a population of 100\r\n\r\nmillion  and  endowed  with a  variety  of  natural\r\n\r\nresources,  the  open  door  investment  policy  we\r\n\r\npursue  may  not be the best long-term  development\r\n\r\nstrategy. In such a situation we should develop  an\r\n\r\nindigenous technology centred initially around  the\r\n\r\nexploitation of natural resources. But  this  would\r\n\r\ntake  time, and would constrain the economy to slow\r\n\r\ngrowth  rates  for possibly several  decades  while\r\n\r\nuniversities  and  research  institutions  need  to\r\n\r\nbuild up staff and expertise. But the pay-off would\r\n\r\ncome  in  the  end and most of it would  accrue  to\r\n\r\ncitizens of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our situation is the opposite to what I have\r\n\r\ndescribed.  An  open door policy is  one  which  at\r\n\r\nleast  ensures rapid growth right from  the  start.\r\n\r\nWhen  foreign  corporations bring their  expertise,\r\n\r\nwhat  we experience, as a developing nation,  is  a\r\n\r\nbrain-drain in reverse. Naturally we pay for  this.\r\n\r\nWe  pay  in  the form of profits and know-how  fees\r\n\r\nremitted  abroad  and  high  salaries  to   foreign\r\n\r\nmanagement and technical personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the position we find ourselves in today\r\n\r\nand  it is likely to persist into the mid-seventies\r\n\r\nand, in lesser extent, even after that. It would be\r\n\r\nwrong  for  us  to resent the inflow of  management\r\n\r\npersonnel,  engineers and technicians from  abroad.\r\n\r\nOn  the  contrary, we could regard them as  blazing\r\n\r\nthe  trail for the new industries which we  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  knowledge  and  technology  to  set   up\r\n\r\nourselves. We should also regard them as presenting\r\n\r\nus not only with opportunities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor   future  graduates  of  our  Universities  and\r\n\r\ntechnical schools but also as performing invaluable\r\n\r\nservices in giving firm indications as to the lines\r\n\r\nof  science  and  industrial technology  which  our\r\n\r\nUniversities   and  training  institutions   should\r\n\r\ndevelop.  Without such clear indications, Singapore\r\n\r\nmight  make the mistake of other developing nations\r\n\r\nin  producing large numbers of university graduates\r\n\r\nwho  cannot  find  useful employment.  Having  said\r\n\r\nthis,  I  need also say that in the long  term  the\r\n\r\nscientific  know-how  and  technological  processes\r\n\r\nwhich  we now borrow from abroad must in course  of\r\n\r\ntime   develop  on  an  indigenous  base   at   our\r\n\r\ninstitutions of higher learning. This is  the  task\r\n\r\nwhich  I see as deserving of high priority  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming decade. We must make good the neglect of our\r\n\r\nuniversities  of  the  past decade  when,  for  the\r\n\r\nreasons  I have explained, they did not participate\r\n\r\nin  the exciting transformation of Singapore,  from\r\n\r\ncolony,  to  a State in a Federation,  and  then  a\r\n\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, \"That Parliament approves the\r\n\r\nfinancial   policy  of  the  Government   for   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  1st  April, 1970  to  31st  March,\r\n\r\n1971.\" In accordance with paragraph (1) of Standing\r\n\r\nOrder 82, the debate now stands adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Goh, debate to be resumed, what day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On the 18th of March, 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.
