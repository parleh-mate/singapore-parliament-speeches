An essential condition is that performers  do\r\n\r\nnot  receive payment for their services. Details are  given\r\n\r\nin  section  12 of the Entertainments Duty Act  (Chapter  1\r\n\r\n36).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultural shows organised by other establishments may also\r\n\r\nqualify for entertainments duty exemption provided that the\r\n\r\nfunds are used for the same purposes and an endorsement  is\r\n\r\nreceived from the benefiting organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By private shows, I assume the Member is referring to\r\n\r\nperformances  by  profit  making  organisations  where  the\r\n\r\nproceeds   are  not  used  for  charitable, philanthropic,\r\n\r\neducational  or  sporting  purposes.  Entertainments   duty\r\n\r\nexemption  is discretionary but will generally  be  granted\r\n\r\nwhere  the performance has intrinsic cultural value. It  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to spell out precisely what shows are of cultural\r\n\r\nvalue,  but  generally  symphonic concerts,  chamber  music\r\n\r\nensembles,  operas,  ballets, plays and  national  cultural\r\n\r\nshows  are  given  exemption. The unduly  esoteric  or  the\r\n\r\nmundane  will  not  normally qualify for  exemption.  Other\r\n\r\naspects  that are taken into consideration are whether  the\r\n\r\nperformers are of international status and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  the performance would appeal to a reasonably  wide\r\n\r\ncross section of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

What is the difference between  a  show\r\n\r\norganised  by a private individual and that of a charitable\r\n\r\norganisation?   Recently, there  have  been   many   shows\r\n\r\norganised by private individuals for their own benefit, and\r\n\r\nthey  were given tax exemption. Why is there discrimination\r\n\r\nbetween   the   cinemas  and  the  National   Theatre?   If\r\n\r\nentertainment duty is paid by the cinemas, why is duty  not\r\n\r\ncharged for shows organised ,by private individuals at  the\r\n\r\nNational  Theatre?  If  a  show  is  organised  not  for  a\r\n\r\ncharitable cause, then entertainment duty should be levied.\r\n\r\nIf  the  private organisations want to organise  shows  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own  benefit, entertainment duty must be imposed  as\r\n\r\nfor the cinemas. If it is a charitable show, then it should\r\n\r\nbe exempted from tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a loophole in the law and I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nwill look into this. The Minister should also look into the\r\n\r\nwording  of  the  relevant law. I  have  received  so  many\r\n\r\ncomplaints  on  this  that  I  have  to  put  forward  this\r\n\r\nquestion.

In saying so. Sir, I have in mind particularly  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  Government to at least have some say in  how  an\r\n\r\narchitect's fee should be calculated. At present, I believe\r\n\r\narchitects  in the Republic follow an agreed scale  of  fee\r\n\r\nfixed  by  the Singapore Institute of Architects  (SIA  for\r\n\r\nshort).  This  scale,  if  I am  not  mistaken,  was  taken\r\n\r\nwholesale  from the RIBA, the British counterpart  of  SIA.\r\n\r\nWith the memory of the fierce rate of inflation in the cost\r\n\r\nof  construction over the last couple of years still  fresh\r\n\r\nin  my  mind,  I  do  like to question the  equity  of  the\r\n\r\ncustomary  practice  of  the  architectural  profession  in\r\n\r\ncalculating  fees by applying a uniform percentage  on  the\r\n\r\ncontract sum of any one particular job irrespective  as  to\r\n\r\nthe  time spent. This would appear to me also to be totally\r\n\r\nunrelated to the quantity of work involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to give an illustration, if today the contract value\r\n\r\nof   a  particular  job  is  $10,000  the  architect's  fee\r\n\r\napplicable  calculated at 7\u00bd% would be $750. But  tomorrow,\r\n\r\nif  for  any reason either on account of escalation in  the\r\n\r\ncosts  of building materials or labour, the same job should\r\n\r\nbe  valued at $20,000 the architect would still be entitled\r\n\r\nto  7\u00bd%  but  on  the enhanced value, or  $1,500,  i.e, an\r\n\r\nincrease   of   100%  in  fees:  although  it   is   highly\r\n\r\nquestionable  whether the quantity of work  involved  under\r\n\r\nsuch circumstances has proportionately increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sort of internally-generated inflation which\r\n\r\nis  well within our control, and something ought to be done\r\n\r\nabout  it, perhaps by suitable provision in the law  giving\r\n\r\nthe regulating authorities the right to step in as and when\r\n\r\nthe   occasion  so  demands.  At  a  time   when   we   are\r\n\r\nenergetically  pursuing the renewal of our City  state,  we\r\n\r\nshould  wherever and whenever possible endeavour  to  bring\r\n\r\ndown the cost of construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17, sub-clause (1)(c) imposes certain penalties\r\n\r\nupon unauthorised persons undertaking \"architectural work\".\r\n\r\nHowever, there appears to be no attempt under the  Bill  to\r\n\r\ndefine  what  is  \"architectural work\". This  leads  me  to\r\n\r\nwonder  whether in the actual implementation of the  law  a\r\n\r\nsituation  might not arise whereby owing to ambiguities  of\r\n\r\nthe law, offences could be committed unwittingly by certain\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public under the relevant section. What  is\r\n\r\narchitectural work? Is interior decoration involving  minor\r\n\r\nstructural  alteration  to be considered  as  architectural\r\n\r\nwork?   There  are  at  present  a  number  of   small-time\r\n\r\ncontractors involved in such type of work at HDB flats  and\r\n\r\nother private residential estates. Would they be considered\r\n\r\nas  undertaking  architectural work? Presumably  the  legal\r\n\r\ndefinition  is  to  be found in our Building  bye-laws  and\r\n\r\nregulations.  Perhaps  the  Hon.  Minister  would  care  to\r\n\r\nclarify for the benefit of the general public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also take the opportunity of urging the Minister\r\n\r\nto review our existing bye-laws and regulations at an early\r\n\r\ndate;  first, to ensure whether they are still  in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith  and  relevant  to  our  present  circumstances,   and\r\n\r\nsecondly, to consider excluding therefrom certain types  of\r\n\r\nwork   which   may   not  strictly  require   architectural\r\n\r\nexpertise. In making the second suggestion I have  in  mind\r\n\r\nthe   construction  and  alteration  of  wooden  structures\r\n\r\ncommonly  seen in our rural areas. At present, the services\r\n\r\nof  architects  are required in conjunction with  all  such\r\n\r\nstructures  except. I believe, where the built-up  area  is\r\n\r\nless  than  200 sq, ft. In practice considerable  confusion\r\n\r\nhas been caused by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe regulating authorities in this particular area of work.\r\n\r\nFor  instance,  I  have come across cases where  occupants,\r\n\r\napplying  for a change of roofing from attap to  corrugated\r\n\r\niron sheets, have been asked to submit architectural plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area of development that has prompted me to\r\n\r\nsuggest  a  review  is  the  increasing  tendency  to   use\r\n\r\nprefabricated   steel   structures   for   industrial   and\r\n\r\nwarehousing  purposes. Looking at such type of  structures,\r\n\r\nas  a  layman  it  would appear to me to be  sufficient  to\r\n\r\nrequire  only  the services of engineers without  involving\r\n\r\narchitects.  In this way we could help to keep construction\r\n\r\ncosts  down,  as  we all know that the architect's  fee  is\r\n\r\nnormally calculated at 7\u00bd%, whereas the engineer's  fee  is\r\n\r\nonly  2\u00bd%. It is pertinent for me to make clear that I have\r\n\r\nnot   been  lobbied  by  the  engineering  profession   and\r\n\r\ntherefore  hold no briefs on their behalf. My concern  here\r\n\r\nis  simply the saving of construction costs for our general\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

I  also notice that many amendments  will  be\r\n\r\nmoved  at  the Committee stage. This is a Bill to amend  an\r\n\r\nold  Act and I am sure the Ministry must have been thinking\r\n\r\nof amending this Act for quite some time. The Bill contains\r\n\r\nonly  26  clauses, of which eight are to  be  amended.  The\r\n\r\ntotal number of amendments that will be moved is 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is becoming a habit of the Government to amend\r\n\r\nBills  at  Committee stage, not in the case  of  this  Bill\r\n\r\nalone but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neven  in  other Bills previously.

But in\r\n\r\nthis  particular case, as in many other previous instances,\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  has been introduced by the Government  and  soon\r\n\r\nafter  its Second Reading, many, many amendments are to  be\r\n\r\nmoved by the Government in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just wondering. Sir, whether this is the result of\r\n\r\ncarelessness or insufficient thought given on the  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  that  introduces the Bill, or  whether  the\r\n\r\nproblem  lies with the people who drafted the Bill. Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  would care to explain. I am sure  he  has  a\r\n\r\nlegitimate  reason for these amendments. If  so,  why  were\r\n\r\nthey  not  given  sufficient thought before  the  Bill  was\r\n\r\nintroduced?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share\r\n\r\nsome of the sentiments of the Member for Jalan Kayu. Here I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to state that while the architects'  interests\r\n\r\nare  being  sufficiently provided for  in  this  Bill, the\r\n\r\nconsumer is still not adequately protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must hasten to add that there is some protection now\r\n\r\nafforded  to consumers, but very little indeed. There  must\r\n\r\nbe a move by Government to ensure that in the services area\r\n\r\nthere  is consumer protection. The Government had  seen  it\r\n\r\nfit  to  introduce  in  the products  area  protection  for\r\n\r\nconsumers in the form of the Consumers Protection  Act.  It\r\n\r\nis  my hope that the Government looks more closely into the\r\n\r\nservices area to ensure adequate protection for consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, by \"consumer\r\n\r\nprotection\"  I  presume the Hon.

Member\r\n\r\nfor Jalan Kayu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of architect's fees raised by the Hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Jalan Kayu, the fee for new works done is  7\u00bd%\r\n\r\nof the cost of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexecuted   works  as  currently  shown  in  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nInstitute   of  Architects  (SIA)  \"Scale  of  Professional\r\n\r\nCharges\".  For repetitive work, the fee is on  a  declining\r\n\r\nscale  from  6%  down to 4%. I understand and  it  is  also\r\n\r\nunderstood  that these rates are non-mandatory  guides  for\r\n\r\nSIA  members  and  that in actual practice,  the  fees  are\r\n\r\nnegotiable between the client and the architect. It is also\r\n\r\nmy  understanding that the total cost of works may be based\r\n\r\non  the tender price or on a fixed lump sum, in which  case\r\n\r\nthe  question of inflation affecting architect's fees  does\r\n\r\nnot  arise. However, should the total cost of work be based\r\n\r\non  the final settlement of the accounts, then the basis of\r\n\r\narriving  at the final cost of works is negotiable  between\r\n\r\nthe  architect and the client. Any increase in fees due  to\r\n\r\ninflationary   elements  is  again  a  matter   of   mutual\r\n\r\nsettlement. Since architects' fees are negotiable, there is\r\n\r\nno  necessity to make provisions in this Bill to  stipulate\r\n\r\nthe scale of fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it may be pertinent to point out that clause 5\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill  provides that one of the functions  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard  of  Architects  is  to determine  and  regulate  the\r\n\r\nprofessional   conduct  and  ethics  of  the  architectural\r\n\r\nprofession,  as  well  as  to hear and  determine  disputes\r\n\r\nrelating   to  the  professional  conduct  or   ethics   of\r\n\r\nregistered  architects.  Within  this  context, therefore.\r\n\r\ncases  of malpractice or conduct which is infamous  in  the\r\n\r\nprofessional aspect can be brought to the attention of  the\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.   Members  of  Parliament  may  wish  to  know   that\r\n\r\npreviously,  under the Architects Ordinance  of  1941,  the\r\n\r\nBoard  of Architects was empowered to fix a scale  of  fees\r\n\r\ncharged. However, this was removed by an amendment  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance in 1957 as it was felt that the Government should\r\n\r\nnot interfere in the fees charged, which should be left  to\r\n\r\nmarket  forces.  However, I would like to assure  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMember  that  should a situation at any  time  warrant  the\r\n\r\narchitect's  fees to be fixed, amendments could accordingly\r\n\r\nbe considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu made a correct observation in\r\n\r\nthat  the term \"architectural work\" is not defined  in  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ministry is aware of this and to avoid ambiguity in the\r\n\r\ninterpretation (and this is one of the reasons in answer to\r\n\r\nthe  Hon.  Member for Telok Blangah) an amendment  will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced  at  the  Committee stage to  delete  clause  17\r\n\r\n(1)(c).  Certain other minor amendments to  the  Bill  will\r\n\r\nalso be moved at the Committee stage and the reasons are to\r\n\r\nmake  the  Bill more explicit. Perhaps I can say  that  the\r\n\r\nreasons for the amendments are both of a drafting nature as\r\n\r\nwell as the result of representations and observations made\r\n\r\nby  some  MPs  and the Singapore Institute  of  Architects.\r\n\r\nGenerally, architects do not build houses without amendment\r\n\r\nto the plans. So at the last moment the Singapore Institute\r\n\r\nof Architects made further representations to the Ministry,\r\n\r\nand  to  show  that  we  are open to  suggestions  we  have\r\n\r\ntherefore incorporated a few of the suggestions or recommen\r\n\r\ndations made by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed also seek to strengthen the\r\n\r\nauthority  of the Minister vis-avis the Board of Architects\r\n\r\nand  also  to give the Board of Architects more flexibility\r\n\r\nin  meting out punishment for lesser offences which do  not\r\n\r\nwarrant suspension or deregistration as required under  the\r\n\r\nexisting unamended Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point raised by the Hon. Member for Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu  on  minor works, let me say that for alterations  and\r\n\r\nadditions  to  HDB  flats and other  private  residences  a\r\n\r\nsubmission of building plans by architects is not required.\r\n\r\nHowever, where there are major additions and alterations or\r\n\r\nwhere  additions  and alterations entail  structural  works\r\n\r\ninvolving safety standards, architect's plans are required.\r\n\r\nRecently,  the Building Control Division issued  guidelines\r\n\r\nas  to  the  type  of building works which do  not  require\r\n\r\nsubmission  of  building  plans  by  architects,  and  this\r\n\r\ninformation is available at the Building Control  Division,\r\n\r\nif required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's comment on the erection of temporary\r\n\r\ndwellings  in the rural areas, the BCD makes available  six\r\n\r\nstandard-type plans so that applicants need not engage  the\r\n\r\nservices of an architect. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservices  of an architect are only required where erections\r\n\r\ndo not conform to any of these six standard-type plans, and\r\n\r\nthis is obviously to ensure that the plans comply with  all\r\n\r\nthe necessary building requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also suggested looking into and updating the\r\n\r\nexisting  regulations under the Local Government (Building)\r\n\r\nRegulations. We are looking into this at this juncture, and\r\n\r\nappropriate amendments will be made when we are  ready  for\r\n\r\nit.  I would also like to inform the Member that the change\r\n\r\nof  roofing from attap to corrugated iron sheets  or  other\r\n\r\nlight-weight  materials such as asbestos does  not  require\r\n\r\narchitect's plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also made a valid point on the use of\r\n\r\nservices  of engineers as against architects in engineering\r\n\r\ntype of works. As things stand, building plans can only  be\r\n\r\nsubmitted  by persons registered under the Architects  Act.\r\n\r\nConsequently, in  the present context an  engineer  cannot\r\n\r\nsubmit  building  plans unless he is registered  under  the\r\n\r\nArchitects Act. The Institution of Engineers Singapore, and\r\n\r\nthe Association of Consulting Engineers Singapore, together\r\n\r\nwith  the  Singapore  Institute of  Architects,  have  made\r\n\r\nrepresentations to the Ministry. The question of permitting\r\n\r\nengineers  to  submit building plans for certain  types  of\r\n\r\nprojects,  for example, prefabricated works, as brought  up\r\n\r\nby  the Member, is being discussed between these interested\r\n\r\nparties.  We will incorporate the necessary recommendations\r\n\r\nin  the  Schedule  to the Building Regulations  when  these\r\n\r\nissues are mutually settled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to assure Members of this House\r\n\r\nthat  both  the Singapore Institute of Architects  and  the\r\n\r\npresent  Board of Architects have been consulted throughout\r\n\r\nthe  whole period of the drafting of this Bill. I have also\r\n\r\nindicated   earlier   that  even   at   the   last   moment\r\n\r\nrepresentations made by these organisations  were  accepted\r\n\r\nand incorporated in amendments which will be introduced  at\r\n\r\nthe  Committee  stage, and they have fully  supported  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Dr Tan Eng Liang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 7 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 5, lines 9 and 10, to leave Out \"Board may with\r\n\r\nthe approval of the Minister exempt\" and insert \"Minister\r\n\r\nmay after consultation with the Board exempt subject to\r\n\r\nsuch conditions as he thinks fit\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this amendment is to empower the Minister\r\n\r\nto   grant  exemption  in  respect  of  fulfilling  certain\r\n\r\nconditions  for  registration after consultation  with  the\r\n\r\nBoard of Architects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 to 11 inclusive ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 6, line 21, at end, to add -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(f) if it appears to the Board that he has contravened any provision of the code of professional conduct and ethics prescribed under section 21;

Over the last few years\r\n\r\nmore  and more efforts have been taken by ports and various\r\n\r\nauthorities  in different parts of the world  to  keep  the\r\n\r\nseas and oceans around them clean and free of pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in Singapore is no exception. Situated at a\r\n\r\nfocal   point  of  international  shipping, the  Port   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  last  year recorded some 40,426 vessel  arrivals\r\n\r\nand   departures  giving  a  total  of  205.2  million  net\r\n\r\nregistered tons of shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is also a major oil refining centre, a large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  oil  tankers, some of  them  Very  Large  Crude\r\n\r\nCarriers,  discharge crude oil and load  refined  petroleum\r\n\r\nproducts  at  the  various  oil  terminals  in  our   port.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the threat of oil pollution in Singapore  waters\r\n\r\nis a constant one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port of Singapore Authority is charged with the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  keeping our waters clean.  Legislations\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act,  1971\r\n\r\nand  the  Civil Liability (Oil Pollution) Act, 1  973  have\r\n\r\nbeen  drawn  up  to  prevent vessels from  indiscriminately\r\n\r\npolluting our waters with oil and rubbish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, legislation in itself does not help the Port of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Authority  in a real situation  arising  out  of\r\n\r\naccident   in  our  port  waters.  Besides  improving   the\r\n\r\nnavigability  of  the  sea  lanes  and  the   addition   of\r\n\r\nnavigational aids, the Port of Singapore Authority  has  to\r\n\r\nhave  available sufficient equipment to combat  oil  spills\r\n\r\nand  to  prevent the oil from polluting our beaches in  the\r\n\r\nevent  of  an accident. To this end, the Port of  Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority  has  worked tirelessly to acquire anti-pollution\r\n\r\nequipment and to build anti-oil pollution capabilities into\r\n\r\nits tugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment on such specialised equipment is high. It is\r\n\r\ntherefore necessary that organisations actively involved in\r\n\r\nthe  refining of petroleum or transport of petroleum should\r\n\r\nalso  play an active role by building up their own anti-oil\r\n\r\npollution  capabilities in Singapore so that  they  can  be\r\n\r\ncalled upon at short notice to assist the Port of Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority in fighting major oil spills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore proposed to amend paragraph (b) of\r\n\r\nsection  27(2) of the Prevention of Pollution  of  the  Sea\r\n\r\nAct,  1971  to  require  the owners  or  operators  of  oil\r\n\r\nterminals   in   Singapore   to  store   such   detergents,\r\n\r\ndispersants   and   equipment,   as   are   prescribed   by\r\n\r\nregulations, to  deal  with  any  pollution  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill-[Mr Ong Teng Cheong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LEGAL PROFESSION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.
