My\r\n\r\ncolleague  the Deputy Prime Minister, as  Leader  of\r\n\r\nthe  House, stated in col. 929 of Hansard, Vol.  14,\r\n\r\nNo. 11:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This last-minute reversal of stand, after stating\r\n\r\nexplicitly that he intended to substantiate  charges\r\n\r\nwhich  we believe to be false, speaks for itself.  I\r\n\r\nhad  expected  him,  honour  bound,  to  pursue  the\r\n\r\nallegations  he had made in this House. However,  in\r\n\r\nview  of  the fact that he has changed his  mind  17\r\n\r\nminutes before the sitting of this Assembly, I  have\r\n\r\nto  move  that the motion that is before  the  House\r\n\r\nshould be adjourned sine die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this adjournment sine die is that\r\n\r\nsince  Mr  Ong Eng Guan, the man who has  made  the\r\n\r\nallegations, is no longer a Member of this House, it\r\n\r\nwill  be better to have the allegations investigated\r\n\r\nand  conducted outside this Chamber. It is intended,\r\n\r\ntherefore, to set up a Commission of Inquiry with  a\r\n\r\nHigh Court Judge as Commissioner to investigate  the\r\n\r\ntruth of the allegations that have been made against\r\n\r\ntwo  Ministers,  It is our hope that the  Commission\r\n\r\nwill  commence its hearing and complete its findings\r\n\r\nas  soon as possible so that they could be tabled in\r\n\r\nthis  House.

One  allegation\r\n\r\nconcerns  the re-employment of Mr M. R.  Marcus  in\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council. In col. 786 in Hansard,  No.  9,\r\n\r\nVol. 14, dated 19th December, 1960, Mr Ong Eng Guan\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I wonder if this is the way to get away from the\r\n\r\nP.S.C. in  order  to give a job to this  particular\r\n\r\nofficer  who  happens  to be a brother-in-law  of  a\r\n\r\nMinister.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The other two allegations concern the appointment of\r\n\r\nMr   Kwa   Soon   Chuan   as  Deputy   Commissioner\r\n\r\n(Valuation).  In  col. 786 of  the  same  volume  of\r\n\r\nHansard of the same number, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to put it to the\r\n\r\nMinister that many of these recommendations - which  I\r\n\r\nhave read myself - are meant for the purpose of fixing\r\n\r\nup certain things.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>He also said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In my opinion, there is nothing, as far as I\r\n\r\nknow, to merit the transfer other than the fact that\r\n\r\nhe is the brother-in-law of the Prime Minister.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>These were serious allegations as they implied  that\r\n\r\nthese  officers  had  been  favoured  in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice because they happened to be related  to  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and the Minister for Labour and Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate on this motion, Mr Ong Eng Guan\r\n\r\nsought  to  by-pass  my motion  by  challenging  the\r\n\r\nruling  of  the Speaker in admitting  my  motion  of\r\n\r\ncondemnation,   and  that  this  Assembly   had   no\r\n\r\njurisdiction   to  deal  with  the  matters   raised\r\n\r\ntherein.  We,  on the Government side,  were  in  no\r\n\r\ndoubt at all that the Assembly had powers to condemn\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim in the circumstances of the\r\n\r\ncase  and  in  the  light of the constitutional  and\r\n\r\nstatutory   provisions  extant  in  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nOpposition,   however,  sought  to  make   political\r\n\r\ncapital out of this matter by supporting Mr Ong Eng\r\n\r\nGuan. They confessed that they were confused on  the\r\n\r\nadmissibility of the motion. You, Mr Speaker,  have\r\n\r\nsince sought the opinion of the Fourth\r\n\r\nClerk-at-the-Table  in  the House of Commons-a senior officer  of\r\n\r\nthat  House primarily charged with the special duty,\r\n\r\nwhen  asked,  of assisting and advising legislatures\r\n\r\nin  the  Commonwealth on matters referred to him  by\r\n\r\nthe  Clerks of such legislatures. You, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nread  out  the  opinion of the Fourth \r\n\r\nClerk-at-the-Table at the sitting of the Assembly last Wednesday.\r\n\r\nThe  Fourth Clerk-at-the-Table states that he  would\r\n\r\nbe fairly certainly of the opinion that the Assembly\r\n\r\ndoes  have such powers. He adds [Hansard,  Vol.  14,\r\n\r\nNo. 13, 22nd February, 1961]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There seems to be nothing indeed to prevent any\r\n\r\ndeliberative body (such as for example  the  Council\r\n\r\nof  a  Trade  Union) doing this, provided  that  the\r\n\r\nmotion does not contain a libel. In the case of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly, the question of libel does not\r\n\r\narise  in  view  of  Section 3  of  the  Powers  and\r\n\r\nPrivileges  Ordinance, 1955. Furthermore  the  words\r\n\r\n\"except  upon  a substantive motion moved  for  that\r\n\r\npurpose\"  contained in Standing Order 46 (10)  would\r\n\r\nappear  expressly to envisage the moving of a motion\r\n\r\ncondemning a Member for his personal conduct.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  brief, the Fourth Clerk-at-the-table admits that\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly,  on a substantive  motion,  has  the\r\n\r\npower  to condemn Mr Ong Eng Guan for dishonourable\r\n\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 23rd December, 1960, Mr Ong Eng Guan said\r\n\r\nhe  wished  to  substantiate all the things  he  had\r\n\r\nsaid; he had nothing to apologise for. But, however,\r\n\r\nhe pleaded for time to prepare his case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Government had no intention to prevent him from\r\n\r\nspeaking  or  to  prevent him  from  seeking  advice\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  The  debate was, therefore,  accordingly\r\n\r\nadjourned to the 29th December, 1960, when the House\r\n\r\nwould resolve itself into Committee to hear whatever\r\n\r\nevidence  he  could  bring forward  to  substantiate\r\n\r\nthose allegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 29th December, 1960, Members assembled in\r\n\r\nthis   Chamber - the  Opposition  perhaps  agog   with\r\n\r\nexcitement, thinking that Mr Ong Eng Guan  would\r\n\r\nprovide  them  with the cudgels  to  hammer  at  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. December 29th, however, turned out to  be  an\r\n\r\nanti-climax  instead. On that day you, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nannounced  that  Mr Ong Eng Guan had  tendered  his\r\n\r\nresignation from the Assembly a few minutes earlier.\r\n\r\nAlthough  Mr Ong Eng Guan sought to run  away  from\r\n\r\ngiving  evidence in Committee of the  Assembly,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment obviously could not allow the  matter  to\r\n\r\nrest there. If we had permitted Mr Ong Eng Guan  to\r\n\r\nleave   his  allegations  unsubstantiated   in   the\r\n\r\nAssembly, the smears that he had uttered would  have\r\n\r\nstuck  and grave injustice would have been  done  to\r\n\r\nthe   persons  against  whom  he  had   made   these\r\n\r\nallegations.  Accordingly I moved  that  the  motion\r\n\r\ncondemning Mr Ong Eng Guan be adjourned  sine  die,\r\n\r\nand  announced that the Government would  set  up  a\r\n\r\nCommission  of  Inquiry with a High Court  Judge  as\r\n\r\nCommissioner  to  investigate  the  truth   of   the\r\n\r\nallegations  that have been made against  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and the Minister for Labour and Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A commission under Mr Justice Chua was appointed\r\n\r\non  the  31st  December, 1960, with these  terms  of\r\n\r\nreference:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) to inquire into the truth of the allegations\r\n\r\non  the  re-appointment of Mr M. R. Marcus  in\r\n\r\nthe  City Council made by Mr Ong Eng  Guan  in\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative Assembly on the 10th December, 1960;\r\n\r\n                       \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to inquire into the truth of the allegations\r\n\r\non  the  appointment of the Deputy Commissioner\r\n\r\n(Valuation)  made by Mr Ong Eng  Guan  in  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly  on  the  12th  December,1960;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to inquire into the truth of the allegations\r\n\r\non  the  appointment of Mr Kwa Soon  Chuan  as\r\n\r\nDeputy  Commissioner (Valuation)  made  by  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng  Guan in the Legislative  Assembly  on\r\n\r\nthe 12th December, 1960.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>During  the Inquiry an undertaking was given by  the\r\n\r\nState  Advocate-General on behalf of the  Government\r\n\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No action under the Official Secrets Ordinance or\r\n\r\nunder  any  other  written law and  no  disciplinary\r\n\r\naction  will be taken by the Government against  any\r\n\r\nperson  who  prior  to  this Inquiry  disclosed  any\r\n\r\ninformation on any matter relating to or in  respect\r\n\r\nof  this  Inquiry and/or who will be giving evidence\r\n\r\nin this Inquiry'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>We gave this undertaking because we had nothing evil\r\n\r\nto  hide and we were anxious that the truth be  out.\r\n\r\nMembers  have  by  now studied  the  Report  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry and read the findings  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission. On Mr Ong Eng Guan's evidence in  chief\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner  had this  to  say:  (On  page  6,\r\n\r\nparagraphs  14 and 15 of the Report of  the  Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommission, Paper Cmd. 7 of 1961).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`14. Mr Ong Eng Guan gave me the impression that\r\n\r\nhe  was in possession of some inside knowledge about\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and  I anticipated  that  startling\r\n\r\ndisclosures   would  be  made.   I   gathered   this\r\n\r\nimpression  because the first two days' hearing  and\r\n\r\npart  of  the third day's hearing were taken  up  by\r\n\r\narguments by his counsel that Government should give\r\n\r\nan  undertaking in no uncertain terms that witnesses\r\n\r\nwho gave evidence before the Commission would not be\r\n\r\nliable   to  criminal  proceedings  or  disciplinary\r\n\r\nactions  and  such an undertaking was given  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Mr Ong Eng Guan, however, had  nothing\r\n\r\nto disclose. He did not even have any facts on which\r\n\r\nhe based his allegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. Mr Ong Eng Guan, in the course of giving his\r\n\r\nevidence,  made statements which were  either\r\n\r\nhalf-truths  or  vague allegations with the intention  of\r\n\r\nmisleading the Commission. I find that he would tell\r\n\r\nan  untruth  when  it  suited  him.  All  the  three\r\n\r\nallegations  made  by  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan  in   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly against the Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  and  all  the\r\n\r\nallegations which he made against the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nin  the  course  of  giving  his  evidence  in  this\r\n\r\nCommission are untrue, groundless and reckless.  Mr\r\n\r\nOng Eng Guan is a person not to be believed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the re-employment of Mr M. R. Marcus into the\r\n\r\nCity  Council, Mr P. C. Lim, who was  described  by\r\n\r\nMr Ong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEng  Guan  as  his key witness, told the  Commission\r\n\r\nthat  there  was  nothing  improper  about  the\r\n\r\nre-employment of Mr M. R. Marcus, and the Commissioner\r\n\r\nfound  that  Mr K. M. Byrne did not  influence  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister to re-employ Mr M. R. Marcus and  he\r\n\r\nhad  nothing  to  do  with Mr  M.  R.  Marcus'  \r\n\r\nre-employment. The Commissioner was satisfied that  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister in re-employing Mr M. R. Marcus  did\r\n\r\nso  in  accordance with certain principles which  he\r\n\r\nlaid  down,  when he took over control of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil from Mr Ong Eng Guan, for the re-employment\r\n\r\nof City Council Officers who had resigned during the\r\n\r\nperiod  when Mr Ong Eng Guan was in charge  of  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council.  The Prime Minister  showed  no  bias\r\n\r\ntowards  Mr  M.  R. Marcus. The Commissioner  found\r\n\r\nthat there was nothing improper in re-employing  Mr\r\n\r\nM.  R. Marcus and the allegation of Mr Ong Eng Guan\r\n\r\nis untrue and groundless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the establishment of the post of Deputy\r\n\r\nCommissioner (Valuation) and the appointment of  Mr\r\n\r\nKwa  Soon  Chuan to this post the Commissioner  said\r\n\r\n(in  paras.  26 and 29 in page 9, and in paras.  39, 40,  41  and  42  in page 12 of the  Report  of  the Inquiry Commission, Paper Cmd. 7 of 1961):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`26. Mr Ong Eng Guan's allegations are that these\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Working Party were  all  under  the\r\n\r\ninstructions  of the Prime Minister or the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance, and that \"it would be in the  interest\r\n\r\nof  civil  servants for their own personal good  and\r\n\r\nwelfare  to  take directions without  question  from\r\n\r\ntheir  Ministers\", and that they  set  out  to  make\r\n\r\nrecommendations  for the creation  of  the  post  of\r\n\r\nDeputy    Commissioner   (Valuation),    and    that\r\n\r\nsubsequently  they drew up qualifications  for  that\r\n\r\npost  to  tailor the job for Mr Kwa Soon  Chuan,  a\r\n\r\nbrother-in-law of the Prime Minister,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister could place his brother-in-law  in  a\r\n\r\nkey position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan said that he felt that the Deputy Commissioner (Valuation) had far wider statutory\r\n\r\npowers  than the Deputy Commissioner of Lands.  This\r\n\r\nwas said to show to the Commission that the post  of\r\n\r\nDeputy Commissioner (Valuation) was a key post. When\r\n\r\nMr  Ong  Eng Guan was questioned he was  unable  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate it. This statement of Mr Ong Eng  Guan\r\n\r\nis absolute nonsense.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`29. I find that no Minister interferred in any\r\n\r\nway  with the work and deliberations of the  Working\r\n\r\nParty   and   that  when  it  came  to  a   definite\r\n\r\nrecommendation that recommendation was  put  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance for his decision. I find  that\r\n\r\nthere  is no truth in the allegation of Mr Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan   that   the   post   of  Deputy   Commissioner\r\n\r\n(Valuation)  was  created  just  for  Mr  Kwa  Soon\r\n\r\nChuan.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`39. In the course of his evidence Mr Ong Eng\r\n\r\nGuan  mentioned the names of Mr Lim  Eng  Bee,  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Public Service Commission,  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nKim  San,  the  Deputy Chairman, and Dr  Phay  Seng\r\n\r\nWhatt,  a  member of the Public Service  Commission,\r\n\r\nand  said that they were close friends of either the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister,  or  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance. The suggestion of Mr Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan, it seems to me, is that any of these Ministers\r\n\r\ncould  easily  have  influenced the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission to select Mr Kwa Soon Chuan.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`40. Mr Lim Eng Bee, Mr Lim Kim San, and Dr Phay\r\n\r\nSeng Whatt stated emphatically that in the course of\r\n\r\ntheir duties no Minister had tried to influence them\r\n\r\nand  no Minister had spoken to any of them about Mr\r\n\r\nKwa  Soon Chuan. It is worthy of note that all these\r\n\r\nthree  gentlemen were members of the Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission  when  that  Commission  considered   the\r\n\r\npromotions of timescale officers to Superscale Grade\r\n\r\nG and the Commission promoted Mr Un Hon Kun and not\r\n\r\nMr  Kwa Soon Chuan, who was then senior to  Mr  Un\r\n\r\nHon Kun in the Land Office.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`41. The Public Service Commission had given its\r\n\r\nreasons for selecting Mr Kwa Soon Chuan and  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion  the Public Service Commission  had  made  a\r\n\r\nproper selection.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`42. I find that the posting of Mr Kwa Soon Chuan\r\n\r\nto  act as Deputy Commissioner (Valuation) was  done\r\n\r\nby the Establishment Branch not on the directions of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister or any Minister but on  its  own\r\n\r\ninitiative and on Establishment principles.  I  also\r\n\r\nfind  that  no  Minister had influenced  the  Public\r\n\r\nService Commission in its selection of Mr Kwa  Soon\r\n\r\nChuan to be the Deputy Commissioner (Valuation).  If\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister had wanted to help Mr Kwa  Soon\r\n\r\nChuan in his career in the Administrative Service he\r\n\r\ncould  easily  have  done so in February,  1960,  by\r\n\r\nupholding the security objection against Mr Un  Hon\r\n\r\nKun  thereby giving Mr Kwa Soon Chuan a  chance  of\r\n\r\nbeing  selected for promotion or to continue to  act\r\n\r\nin  the  post of Deputy Commissioner for Lands  with\r\n\r\nthe prospect of being ultimately confirmed in it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as a conclusion to his findings on the\r\n\r\nterms of reference, the Commissioner had this to say\r\n\r\n(para. 43 in page 12):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`43. I find that there is no truth at all in any\r\n\r\nof  the three allegations made by Mr Ong Eng  Guan.\r\n\r\nThese allegations are groundless and recklessly made\r\n\r\nand  there  is  no justification for making  any  of\r\n\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it was perhaps fortunate that Mr Ong Eng Guan left the Assembly to face an independent\r\n\r\nHigh  Court  Judge  in  the Commission  of  Inquiry,\r\n\r\notherwise  he might have gone out and said  that  he\r\n\r\nwas  intimidated by the Government majority and that\r\n\r\njudgment  was  passed on him by those  whom  he  had\r\n\r\nfought.  We now know that Mr Ong Eng Guan,  in  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner's  own words, is \"a person  not  to  be\r\n\r\nbelieved\",  and who \"would tell an untruth  when  it\r\n\r\nsuited him\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Report of the Inquiry Commission has proved\r\n\r\nconclusively that Mr Ong Eng Guan, when  he  was  a\r\n\r\nMember  of  the  Assembly, had  grossly  abused  his\r\n\r\nprivilege  in  this  Assembly in making  allegations\r\n\r\nwhich could not be substantiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me cite a case where an abuse of Assembly privilege was made in the Uttar Pradesh\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly in India.  A  digest  of  what\r\n\r\noccurred  in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nhas been published in the Journal of the Society  of\r\n\r\nClerks-at-the-Table  in  Commonwealth   Parliaments,\r\n\r\nVolume XXVII for 1958, pages 128 to130.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\">'India:    Uttar   Pradesh   Legislative    Assembly</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insinuations by a Member. - On 10th February Shri\r\n\r\nGenda Singh, M.L.A. [i.e., Member of the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly]  gave  notice  of  certain  short   notice\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After scrutiny by the office about their\r\n\r\nadmissibility the orders of the Deputy Speaker  were\r\n\r\nobtained  on  17th  February, 1958,  and  they  were\r\n\r\ntabled for answer on 21st February, 1958. Shri Genda\r\n\r\nSingh's  complaint  was  that  his  questions  after\r\n\r\nadmission  had  been sent to the  Minister  on  11th\r\n\r\nFebruary and that the Minister intentionally delayed\r\n\r\ngiving the reply of the said questions till the 21st\r\n\r\nFebruary. When the questions were answered  on  21st\r\n\r\nFebruary,  Shri Genda Singh said that  the  Minister\r\n\r\ndefied  the Rule and deliberately delayed  answering\r\n\r\nof  questions. He was told by the Speaker that there\r\n\r\nhad  been no delay on the part of the Minister, that\r\n\r\nthe   question  of  admissibility  itself  had  been\r\n\r\ndecided  up  to 17th February by the Deputy  Speaker\r\n\r\nand  that  they  were  tabled for  answers  on  21st\r\n\r\nFebruary,  which was the day meant for the Minister.\r\n\r\nShri Genda\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingh,  however,  insisted that his  questions  were\r\n\r\nadmitted  on 11th and had been sent to the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  for  answers on the  11th  and  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister, who was in the habit of delaying  answers,\r\n\r\nintentionally delayed giving answers till  the  21st\r\n\r\nand   that  the  answers  given  were  evasive.   He\r\n\r\npersisted   in  his  allegation  that  the   Revenue\r\n\r\nMinister  intentionally delayed the replies  to  the\r\n\r\nquestions and was guilty of violation of rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added a request that the matter be referred to\r\n\r\nthe Committee of Privileges, where many things would\r\n\r\ncome to light (the implication being that there  had\r\n\r\nbeen  some tampering with the records). The  Speaker\r\n\r\nthereupon  referred  the  matter  to  the  Privilege\r\n\r\nCommittee for inquiry and report under Rule 67.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee investigated the case and in their\r\n\r\nReport  came  to  a  unanimous  decision  that   the\r\n\r\nquestions  had been sent to the Revenue Minister  on\r\n\r\n17th   February   and  that  there   had   been   no\r\n\r\nmanipulation whatsoever of any kind in  the  records\r\n\r\nof  the  Assembly  Secretariat.  The  Committee  was\r\n\r\nfurther of the opinion that if a member deliberately\r\n\r\nmakes  a  wrong statement and tries to  mislead  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  he should be held to be guilty of the breach\r\n\r\nof privilege of the House. The Committee, therefore,\r\n\r\ncame  to  the  conclusion that the conduct  of  Shri\r\n\r\nGenda  Singh  in  the House, in  persisting  in  his\r\n\r\ncharge   against   the  Revenue  Minister   of   his\r\n\r\ndeliberately delaying the reply to his questions and\r\n\r\nhis   obvious  insinuations  that  there  was   some\r\n\r\ntampering  of  records in the Assembly  Secretariat,\r\n\r\nwas  contumacious and disrespectful and that he  was\r\n\r\nthus guilty of a breach of privilege of the House.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shri Genda Singh did not tender any apology for\r\n\r\nhis  contempt  against  the Revenue  Minister,  Shri\r\n\r\nCharan Singh, and was condemned by the Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what Shri Genda Singh said in the Uttar\r\n\r\nPradesh  Legislative Assembly was pretty mild.  What\r\n\r\nhe had done was that he had uttered an innuendo when\r\n\r\nby saying that certain things would come to light he\r\n\r\ninsinuated that there was a tampering of records and\r\n\r\nthat  this  could  be revealed by the  Committee  of\r\n\r\nPrivileges. Mr Ong Eng Guan had uttered  more  than\r\n\r\nMr  Shri  Genda  Singh  had uttered.  He  had  made\r\n\r\nspecific   and   direct   allegations   and    these\r\n\r\nallegations  have  now been discovered  by  the  Commission of Inquiry to be false.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mr Ong Eng Guan is not today in this\r\n\r\nChamber, his absence, however, does not prevent  the\r\n\r\nHouse  from  condemning  him for  his  dishonourable\r\n\r\nconduct in abusing his privilege in this Assembly as\r\n\r\na cloak for spreading\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmalicious  falsehoods  to unjustly  injure  innocent\r\n\r\npersons both inside and outside this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

I   think  it  is  too  early  to  make   any\r\n\r\npronouncements  on him yet. Let the people  of  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  decide  as to who tell lies and who  should  be\r\n\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I reject and disagree with the\r\n\r\nfindings of this Commission of Inquiry. The most apt\r\n\r\ndescription of this Report is to use the same  words\r\n\r\nspoken  by the Secretary-General of the P.A.P. when\r\n\r\nhe attacked the Buttrose Report on the Chew Swee Kee\r\n\r\nInquiry published during the last general elections.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I refer to the Straits Times dated\r\n\r\n28th May, 1959, page 7, column 8:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Buttrose Commission Report was criticised by\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the  P.A.P. at  a  lunchtime  rally  at\r\n\r\nFullerton Square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Secretary-General of the Party, accused the Commissioner, Mr Justice Buttrose, of\r\n\r\nhaving  exceeded  the terms of  reference.  Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"It was not within his terms of reference  to\r\n\r\npass  judgment on what I said in the Assembly.  That\r\n\r\nis  for the people of Singapore to decide.\" He  said\r\n\r\nthat during the Inquiry while he was cross-examining\r\n\r\nand  giving evidence, Mr Justice Buttrose had  been\r\n\r\nvery  careful to keep him (Mr Lee) within the terms\r\n\r\nof  reference but he himself had strayed outside his\r\n\r\nterms  of reference in several parts of the  Report.\r\n\r\nMr  Lee  said, \"The final judgment on this  matter,\r\n\r\nhowever,  is not made by the Judge but by  the  next\r\n\r\nAssembly which shall debate the issue.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, the final judgment on this Report\r\n\r\nwill be made by the people of Hong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I recall a joint Press statement which my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Member  for  Punggol,  and   myself\r\n\r\nreleased on 30th December, 1960, wherein we said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Governments like Commissions of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not forgotten those appointed by the\r\n\r\nformer Government.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Yes,  Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore have\r\n\r\nnot  forgotten  the Commission of Inquiry  into  the\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  by-election and the  Chew  Swee  Kee\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry. Neither have they  forgotten\r\n\r\nthe  Commission  of Inquiry into the  City  Council.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, this Commission is no exception  and\r\n\r\nneither    will    its   findings - with    which    I\r\n\r\ndisagree - change the fortunes of this  Government  in\r\n\r\nthe Hong Lim by-election. As Commissions have failed\r\n\r\nmiserably  to  save the S.P.A. Government,  so  this\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry will similarly  fail  in  the\r\n\r\nHong Lim by-election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Sir,  the findings of the  Chua  Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommission  have not only cleared the two  Ministers\r\n\r\nof  nepotism,  but  have instead  substantiated  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  contention that Mr Ong  Eng  Guan - who  we\r\n\r\nhave been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntold  by  the Member for Cairnhill would be fighting\r\n\r\nthe   Opposition's  battle  in  the  Hong  Lim  \r\n\r\nby-election - is a man not to be believed and a  man  who\r\n\r\nwould not hesitate to tell an untruth when it suited\r\n\r\nhim.

The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmade the statement about the Buttrose Commission  at\r\n\r\na  public  meeting  and  I  invite  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAljunied  or  Mr  Ong Eng Guan  to  make  the  same\r\n\r\nstatement about the Chua Inquiry Commission  outside\r\n\r\nthe Assembly at a public meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This assessment  of  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  was based on his performance before the Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommission  in the course of only ten sittings.  Mr\r\n\r\nOng,  moreover,  gave his evidence under  oath.  Not\r\n\r\nonly  did  Mr  Ong  persist in  the  falsehoods  he\r\n\r\nuttered  in  this  Assembly, but  with  pathological\r\n\r\nconsistency he embarked upon fresh falsehoods during\r\n\r\nthe Inquiry itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since Mr Ong Eng Guan has been nominated by\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.A. to fight the Opposition's battle, it  is\r\n\r\nonly  fair that the Opposition should point  out  in\r\n\r\ntheir next statement this evaluation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  their  pin-up  boy made by Mr Justice  Chua.  I\r\n\r\nrefer to page 6, paragraph 15 of the Report:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan, in the course of giving his\r\n\r\nevidence,  made statements which were  either  \r\n\r\nhalf-truths  or  vague allegations with the intention  of\r\n\r\nmisleading the Commission. I find that he would tell\r\n\r\nan untruth when it suited him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Right-wing politicians can be quite sure that\r\n\r\nMr  Ong Eng Guan would be fighting the Opposition's\r\n\r\nbattle  in  a  manner which, I  am  sure,  would  do\r\n\r\njustice to the Opposition's cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of Mr Justice Chua furnishes proof\r\n\r\nbeyond  all  doubt  that  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan  acted\r\n\r\ndishonourably  in  this Assembly. Anyone  who  tells\r\n\r\nfalsehoods,  knowing  them to be  falsehoods,  under\r\n\r\ncover  of  Assembly  privilege  to  injure  innocent\r\n\r\npeople outside and inside this Assembly, is, in  our\r\n\r\nopinion,   guilty  of  dishonourable  conduct.   And\r\n\r\ndishonourable  conduct on the  part  of  an  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the people must be severely  dealt\r\n\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, Sir, the Opposition has somewhat different\r\n\r\nviews on this matter and, if so, we shall be glad to\r\n\r\nhear any original point of view. The issue before us\r\n\r\nis  simple:  \"Did Mr Ong utter reckless falsehoods?\r\n\r\nIf  he  did  utter such falsehoods  under  cover  of\r\n\r\nAssembly  privilege, was he not being dishonourable?\r\n\r\nIf  he  had  uttered lies, then  should  he  not  be\r\n\r\ncompelled  to  withdraw them and  apologise  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse?  Would not democracy be brought into contempt\r\n\r\nand  ridicule if Assembly privilege were used  as  a\r\n\r\ncloak to utter falsehoods against innocent people?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answers to all these questions are \"yes\"\r\n\r\nthen  this  motion, far from being  a  blow  against\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  is  intended to  make  more  secure  the\r\n\r\nfoundations of democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from the moment this censure motion was\r\n\r\nbrought  before  this Assembly, the  Right-wing  and\r\n\r\nanti-P.A.P. politicians have sought to confuse  the\r\n\r\nissue  by claiming that it was a Government move  to\r\n\r\nmuzzle a Member of the Opposition. For example,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,   on   18th   December,  1960,  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nCongress - which I understand is a sort of politically\r\n\r\nconscious  animal lovers' league - gave a strong  plug\r\n\r\nfor  Mr  Ong presumably in the belief that  he  was\r\n\r\nanother underdog to be championed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's censure motion was described by\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Congress as a fight between democracy\r\n\r\nand  dictatorship  and an attempt by  \"occupiers  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  Benches ... to muzzle a  Member  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on 24th December, 1960, the coffin was opened\r\n\r\nand  the  Workers  Party came out with  a  statement\r\n\r\ntrying  to depict Mr Ong Eng Guan as a champion  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy. The Chairman of the Workers Party  issued\r\n\r\na  statement couched in the following terms. I quote\r\n\r\nfrom the Straits Times of 24th December, 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Chairman of the Workers Party, Mr David\r\n\r\nMarshall,  today issued this statement:  \"The  first\r\n\r\nmeeting  of  the  new  executive  committee  of  the\r\n\r\nWorkers Party repeats that the Workers Party is  not\r\n\r\nassociated with Mr Ong Eng Guan and has never  been\r\n\r\nassociated with Mr Ong, but expresses its  sympathy\r\n\r\nand  respect  for the heroic effort of  Mr  Ong  in\r\n\r\nstruggling   against  the  attempt  of  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment to silence him and nullify the choice  of\r\n\r\nthe people of Hong Lim.\"'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Marshall is no political chicken and he\r\n\r\nmust  have known that there was no attempt to muzzle\r\n\r\nMr  Ong.  In  fact,  Sir, Mr  Ong  was  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  under  the motion  to  open  his  mouth\r\n\r\nwider.  He  could  have spoken freely  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate his allegations. He was free to do this\r\n\r\nand  that  was what panicked him. As you  recollect,\r\n\r\nSir,   he   said  in  this  House  that   he   would\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  his  allegations, but  when  the  time\r\n\r\ncame,  this man for whom Mr Marshall has such great\r\n\r\nrespect got cold feet and did a bunk - and for a  very\r\n\r\ngood  reason. He could speak freely only if he  were\r\n\r\nallowed  to  utter malicious falsehoods  behind  the\r\n\r\nprotective  shield of Assembly privilege.  This  was\r\n\r\nthe  sort  of  heroic struggle which has  apparently\r\n\r\nearned  for  Mr Ong the respect and greetings  from\r\n\r\nthe political has-beens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Ong was reduced to silence in the Assembly,\r\n\r\nit was only because he was put in the predicament of\r\n\r\nhaving   to  tell  the  truth  or  have   his   lies\r\n\r\nmercilessly  exposed. Chronically incapable  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst and unable to face the second, he declined the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of speaking freely in this Assembly  by\r\n\r\nsubstantiating his allegations and decided  to  quit\r\n\r\nthe Assembly. Sir, he is not, as Right-wing admirers\r\n\r\nof  his  are  trying to insinuate,  a  refugee  from\r\n\r\nP.A.P. intolerance. He was not expelled  from  this\r\n\r\nAssembly by the Government. He ran away of  his  own\r\n\r\naccord,  simply because he had lied his way  into  a\r\n\r\nsituation where resignation appeared to him the only\r\n\r\nsafe course - or so he thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of this motion is simple. If the\r\n\r\nallegations he made were false, and were  proved  to\r\n\r\nbe  false,  then  he  could  have  remained  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly   by  doing  one  of  two  things:   either\r\n\r\nwithdrawing  his falsehoods and apologising  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse;  or  repeating those falsehoods  outside  the\r\n\r\nAssembly   without   the  protection   of   Assembly\r\n\r\nprivilege. But he did neither of these things.  What\r\n\r\nMr    Ong's   \"heroic   struggle\",   as   political\r\n\r\nopportunists describe it, amounted to  is  this.  He\r\n\r\nwanted  not  only the privilege of lying  safely  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly, but he also regarded it as an affront\r\n\r\nto his honour and to the cause of democracy in being\r\n\r\nasked to substantiate his allegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What all this attempt by Right-wing forces to\r\n\r\ndepict  Mr Ong as a heroic fighter for free  speech\r\n\r\nboils down to is this: freedom of speech, so Mr Ong\r\n\r\nand   his  supporters  believe,  also  includes  the\r\n\r\nfreedom to lie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, in essence, is the so-called heroic struggle\r\n\r\nof   Mr   Ong.  That,  in  effect,  would  be   the\r\n\r\n\"Opposition's battle\" that Mr Ong would be fighting\r\n\r\nin  Hong  Lim. Sir, the P.A.P.'s view of freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech  is this: freedom of speech means the freedom\r\n\r\nto  tell the truth without fear. As against this, we\r\n\r\nhave  Mr Ong's and the S.P.A.'s stand that  freedom\r\n\r\nof  speech - they claim that we tried to restrict  Mr\r\n\r\nOng telling lies freely - therefore must include\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  freedom to lie recklessly and deliberately.  If\r\n\r\nan elected representative is not allowed in the name\r\n\r\nof his voters to tell falsehoods, then, according to\r\n\r\nMr   Ong   and   his  Right-wing  supporters,   the\r\n\r\nfoundations   of  democracy  would  be   undermined.\r\n\r\nFreedom to tell the truth as against freedom to tell\r\n\r\nlies - that, when all is said and done, is what  this\r\n\r\nmotion has been trying to decide on from the start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Hong Lim and the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  have to choose between the advocates of  these\r\n\r\ntwo sorts of freedom - freedom to speak the truth, and\r\n\r\nfreedom  to  tell  lies  behind  the  protection  of\r\n\r\nAssembly  privilege. Sir, we do not think  that  the\r\n\r\nRight-wing politicians who now proclaim Mr  Ong  as\r\n\r\ntheir favourite in the Hong Lim by-election believed\r\n\r\nfor one moment that Mr Ong's allegations were true.\r\n\r\nIf  they  had  really suspected that his allegations\r\n\r\nhad  some substance, then I am sure they would  have\r\n\r\nbeen   the   first   to  agitate  for   a   thorough\r\n\r\ninvestigation into the matter. If the allegations of\r\n\r\nnepotism and political corruption were true,  or  if\r\n\r\nthey were believed to be true, then the P.A.P. would\r\n\r\nhave  been discredited in the eyes of the people.  I\r\n\r\nam  quite  sure, Sir, that Members of the Opposition\r\n\r\nare  fully  aware of the damage proof  of  political\r\n\r\ncorruption  can  do to a political party.  Mr  Chew\r\n\r\nSwee  Kee's  case is a very good example.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nwhat surprised us on this side of the House was  the\r\n\r\nindifference  with  which the  Opposition,  some  of\r\n\r\nwhose  Members  tried to nourish  the  soul  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  with  discourses  on  moral  rearmament,\r\n\r\nappeared  to  have  taken Mr Ong's  allegations  of\r\n\r\npolitical  corruption against two P.A.P.  Ministers.\r\n\r\nThose  were  serious charges and, if  true,  merited\r\n\r\nsevere punishment. But you will recollect, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthere  were  no strident demands from the Opposition\r\n\r\nfor  an  immediate  investigation into  the  matter.\r\n\r\nThere  was  no  insistence that Mr  Ong  should  be\r\n\r\nafforded  every opportunity at the earliest possible\r\n\r\nmoment  to  prove  his allegations;  nor  did  those\r\n\r\noutside this Assembly, who have nominated Mr Ong as\r\n\r\nthe patron saint\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   democratic  freedom,  demand  that  Mr   Ong's\r\n\r\nallegations  be  investigated and that  Mr  Ong  be\r\n\r\npressed  to  prove  his  case.  However,  when   the\r\n\r\nGovernment did the Opposition's work by setting  up,\r\n\r\non  its own accord, an Inquiry Commission after  Mr\r\n\r\nOng's   resignation,  even  then  we  expected   the\r\n\r\nOpposition wildly to acclaim this move and press for\r\n\r\nthe  speedy  conclusion of the Inquiry.  Instead  of\r\n\r\nthis,  we  found  Mr Ong's friends making  frenzied\r\n\r\ndemands for an immediate by-election. Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition  joined  in  this chorus.  All  this  was\r\n\r\nrather  curious, to say the least. A Commission  had\r\n\r\nbeen  set up to inquire into serious allegations  of\r\n\r\nnepotism  by  Mr  Ong. Moral  re-armers  and  moral\r\n\r\ndisarmers - one would have thought would  have  waited\r\n\r\nto  find  out  whether the charges of nepotism  were\r\n\r\ntrue. In fact, it would have been to their political\r\n\r\ninterest  to  wait for the findings of  the  Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommission before the by-election. If they  believed\r\n\r\nthat  Mr Ong's allegations had some substance, then\r\n\r\nthe chances of success for Mr Ong in Hong Lim would\r\n\r\nhave  enhanced  a hundred-fold. It would  then  have\r\n\r\nbeen  a  straight fight between an honest man,  like\r\n\r\nMr  Ong,  and a corrupt government. And the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nknows  very  well that the people of  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nalways  ready  to  vote for an honest  and  truthful\r\n\r\ncandidate. That would have been a worthy battle  for\r\n\r\nMr Ong to fight for the Opposition in Hong Lim. But\r\n\r\nif,  on  the other hand, Mr Ong was proved a  liar,\r\n\r\nthen  the  S.P.A. would not have been  put  in  the\r\n\r\npredicament  of getting a proved liar to  fight  its\r\n\r\nbattle in Hong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is precisely the predicament in which the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. now  finds itself. Its battle  in  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nwould be fought by a man found to be a common  or  a\r\n\r\ngarden  liar. In view of the findings of the Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommission, the S.P.A. and other admirers of Mr Ong\r\n\r\nin this Assembly will either have to join with us in\r\n\r\ncondemning  a  man  who  had  clearly  indulged   in\r\n\r\ndishonourable conduct, or stand loyally by him since\r\n\r\nhe has had the S.P.A.'s blessings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it may be that the supporters\r\n\r\nof  Mr Ong knew that his allegations were false and\r\n\r\nwere  anxious that they should not be proved  to  be\r\n\r\nfalse.  As  long  as Mr Ong was not  exposed  as  a\r\n\r\npurveyor  of  deliberate  falsehoods  and  was   not\r\n\r\nprevented,   in  the  name  of  free  speech,   from\r\n\r\npurveying new falsehoods in this Assembly, he  would\r\n\r\nbe  of  great use to the Right-wing enemies  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. He could, far more effectively than the\r\n\r\nRight-wing, confuse the masses about the P.A.P. After all,\r\n\r\nMr  Ong was a former Minister of the Government and\r\n\r\na Party member, and he had moreover hinted from time\r\n\r\nto  time  that he had secrets which would  discredit\r\n\r\nthe  Party  and  the Government.  This  was  another\r\n\r\ndishonourable  tactic that Mr Ong adopted  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly since his eviction from the Party. He  made\r\n\r\nvague  innuendoes  that he had  a  lot  of  sinister\r\n\r\nthings  to  tell about the P.A.P. He  tried  similar\r\n\r\ntactics with the Inquiry Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the hearings began, he produced not only an\r\n\r\nimpressive list of 22 witnesses, but made no end  of\r\n\r\na  fuss  about assurances. He demanded a categorical\r\n\r\nassurance  from  the Government  that  none  of  his\r\n\r\nwitnesses would be victimised. All this hitching  of\r\n\r\nbelts  and  flexing  of  muscles  suggested  to  the\r\n\r\nCommission that Mr Ong was about to make  startling\r\n\r\ndisclosures.  Sir,  let me quote  from  the  Inquiry\r\n\r\nReport - paragraph 14 in page 6. As a  result  of  all\r\n\r\nthis  posing as a man who had deep knowledge of  the\r\n\r\ninner  workings  of the Party and of the  Government\r\n\r\nmachinery, this is the effect he seems to have  made\r\n\r\non the Judge:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan gave me the impression that he\r\n\r\nwas in possession of some inside knowledge about the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and   I  anticipated   that   startling\r\n\r\ndisclosures   would  be  made.   I   gathered   this\r\n\r\nimpression  because the first two day's hearing  and\r\n\r\npart  of  the third day's hearing were taken  up  by\r\n\r\narguments by his counsel that Government should give\r\n\r\nan  undertaking in no uncertain terms that witnesses\r\n\r\nwho gave evidence before the Commission would not be\r\n\r\nliable to criminal proceedings .'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   the  Government  gave  those  assurance.  But,\r\n\r\nconcludes Mr Justice Chua:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan, however, had nothing to\r\n\r\ndisclose. He did not even have any facts on which he\r\n\r\nbased his allegations.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  was  not  because Mr Ong was  prevented  from\r\n\r\nspeaking  and  telling all he knew.  In  fact,  when\r\n\r\nquestioned by the Commissioner, he assured him  that\r\n\r\nhe  had been given every opportunity to say what  he\r\n\r\nwanted  to  say  that there had been no  attempt  to\r\n\r\nsilence  him  in the Commission. Therefore,  it  was\r\n\r\nsurprising to hear the Member for Aljunied  claiming\r\n\r\nor  indicating  that Mr Ong, when  the  by-election\r\n\r\ntakes  place, is going to make new disclosures.  But\r\n\r\nwe  know, Sir, Mr Ong has put on this act of a  man\r\n\r\nwho knows everything before - inside the Party and in\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly. He has often hinted vaguely  that  he\r\n\r\nhad inside knowledge about the terrible goings-on in\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  However, every time he was  pressed  to\r\n\r\nelaborate on these vague smears, he chose to act  as\r\n\r\nthough the world was not yet ready to receive  these\r\n\r\nawful  disclosures of what I can  only  describe  as\r\n\r\n\"Maria  Ong\".  However, he could not get  away  with\r\n\r\nthis act before a Commission where he could be\r\n\r\ncross-examined on the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Right-wing is\r\n\r\ncapitalising on Mr Ong's claim that,  as  a  former\r\n\r\nP.A.P. member, he had awful and terrible secrets  to\r\n\r\ndisclose. The Right-wing, who used him as  a  \r\n\r\nstool-pigeon,  may have suspected that his act was phoney.\r\n\r\nHowever, if by these vague smears and lies he  could\r\n\r\ncreate doubts and suspicions about the P.A.P.,  then\r\n\r\nhe  should not only be encouraged but protected from\r\n\r\nexposure as a chronic and pathological liar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must have been quite clear to many of his\r\n\r\nRight-wing patrons, very early on, that his allegations in\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  were  false and that  the  motion  of\r\n\r\ncensure   would   expose  him  as  a   purveyor   of\r\n\r\nfalsehoods. And once he was exposed as a liar,  then\r\n\r\nhis  lies  could  do no damage to the  P.A.P.,  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  his  usefulness to the Right-wing  would\r\n\r\nhave ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, Right-wing political opportunists like Mr\r\n\r\nMarshall  and  Mrs  Leon Soh and  others  tried  to\r\n\r\nconfuse  the  issue by claiming that the  motion  of\r\n\r\ncensure was a blow at democracy. The many S.P.A. and\r\n\r\nLabour Front lawyers who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvised Mr Ong must have known that his allegations\r\n\r\ncould  not  stand close scrutiny. So the  Right-wing\r\n\r\nrallied  to his side by implying that the  truth  or\r\n\r\notherwise  of his allegations was a trivial  matter,\r\n\r\nand that the censure motion was really an attempt by\r\n\r\nGovernment to silence Mr Ong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Assembly too, Mr Ong, ably assisted by\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition, had tried to confuse  the\r\n\r\nissue by arguments about whether or not the Assembly\r\n\r\nhad  the power to suspend a Member for dishonourable\r\n\r\nconduct.  At  one  point, Sir, I  remember  Mr  Ong\r\n\r\npleaded  with  you with all his heart to  refer  the\r\n\r\nmatter to Sir Ivor Jennings. It is because he was in\r\n\r\na  fix, and, therefore, anything that would postpone\r\n\r\nthe  moment when he knew he would be called upon  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  his  allegations,  or  apologise   and\r\n\r\nwithdraw his allegations, or repeat them outside the\r\n\r\nAssembly  Chamber, was welcome to him.  So  when  he\r\n\r\nfound that he had no choice but to substantiate  his\r\n\r\nallegations, he resigned. It is now clear that if he\r\n\r\ncould  have substantiated his allegations,  then  he\r\n\r\nwould  have  lost  no time in trying  to  prove  his\r\n\r\nallegations.  It was because he knew that  he  could\r\n\r\nnot  that  he, on his own initiative, resigned  from\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly.  No  doubt he thought  that  once  he\r\n\r\nresigned,  he  would be spared the embarrassment  of\r\n\r\nhaving to substantiate his allegations. He preferred\r\n\r\nthe  election platform at Hong Lim because  he  knew\r\n\r\nthat on an election platform, he would not have  his\r\n\r\nlies challenged then and there, face to face, but he\r\n\r\ncould  go  on repeating lies privately in the  quiet\r\n\r\nrooms of his voters unchallenged. That is why he now\r\n\r\nclaims  that this issue of whether Mr Ong Eng  Guan\r\n\r\nis  a  liar  or not should be decided at  Hong  Lim.\r\n\r\nBecause a liar, Sir, likes a monologue. He does  not\r\n\r\nlike to be cross-examined. He likes to speak all  by\r\n\r\nhimself unchallenged. And that is why the Member for\r\n\r\nAljunied  is  now pleading, \"Let us  have  a  second\r\n\r\ntrial  at  Hong Lim\", where Mr Ong can clearly  and\r\n\r\nfreely spread new lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, the appointment of an Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommission upset Mr Ong and his patrons.  It  meant\r\n\r\nthat  he  would  still  have  to  substantiate   his\r\n\r\nallegations,  and  this  time  before  an  impartial\r\n\r\nJudge. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappeared  to  Mr Ong and his friends  that  it  was\r\n\r\nsimply a case of jumping out of the frying pan  into\r\n\r\nthe  fire. So his friends once again rallied to  his\r\n\r\nside.  The  Member  for  Aljunied  was  all  for  an\r\n\r\nimmediate election. There was no need, he  said,  to\r\n\r\nwait for the findings of the Commission because that\r\n\r\nmight take many, many months. The S.P.A. also joined\r\n\r\nin  this  demand for an immediate election. All  Mr\r\n\r\nOng's Right-wing supporters, strangely enough,  were\r\n\r\nmost  anxious to have an election before the Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommission had decided whether Mr Ong's allegations\r\n\r\nof  nepotism were true or not. I believe  they  must\r\n\r\nhave had very good reasons for insisting that \r\n\r\nthe by-election be held before the findings of the  Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommission. They must have known that if he appeared\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Commission, he would be  exposed  as  a\r\n\r\npetty liar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Report of the Commission of Inquiry is\r\n\r\nnow before us - only some two months since Mr Ong Eng\r\n\r\nGuan  resigned. Instead of the Assembly  pronouncing\r\n\r\nverdict  on Mr Ong Eng Guan, we have had this  done\r\n\r\nfor us by a third person - a Judge of the High Court.\r\n\r\nAll  Mr  Ong's allegations have been proved  to  be\r\n\r\nreckless fabrications. He has been described by  the\r\n\r\nJudge  as  a man not to be believed, as  a  man  who\r\n\r\nwould  tell an untruth if it suited him.  The  Judge\r\n\r\nalso  found  that Mr Ong made new false allegations\r\n\r\nbefore the Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these add up to one thing. Not only is\r\n\r\nMr  Ong capable of dishonourable conduct but he was\r\n\r\nguilty  of  dishonourable conduct in  this  Assembly\r\n\r\nwhen  he  recklessly  made allegations  against  two\r\n\r\nMinisters,   knowing  that   what   he   said   were\r\n\r\nfalsehoods. The fact that he dared not repeat  these\r\n\r\nallegations outside the Assembly proved  this.  Sir,\r\n\r\nif   all   these   are  not  reasonable   proof   of\r\n\r\ndishonourable conduct, then I would like to know the\r\n\r\nmeaning of \"dishonourable\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his evidence before the Commission, Mr\r\n\r\nOng described what he claimed was the pattern of the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's  way  of working.  This  so-called\r\n\r\npattern  existed  largely in Mr Ong's  imagination,\r\n\r\nbut it would not be amiss to draw the pattern of Mr\r\n\r\nOng's dishonourable conduct in this Assembly. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthree   allegations  he  made  against  two   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters were not an accidental indiscretion on the\r\n\r\npart  of  Mr Ong. Had it been so, the matter  could\r\n\r\nhave  been  amicably settled by Mr Ong  withdrawing\r\n\r\nhis  allegations.  But these three allegations  were\r\n\r\npart  of  a  systematic campaign of calumny  through\r\n\r\nlies. He had used this strategy of lies and whispers\r\n\r\nin  the  Party  since after the  P.A.P. formed  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Sir, he suffered from the delusion  that\r\n\r\nhe was a budding Mao Tse-tung and Sun Yat Sen rolled\r\n\r\ninto  one. In fact, Sir, during the hearings of  the\r\n\r\nCommission,  he  declared quite seriously  that  the\r\n\r\naberrations  in  his  personal  life  in  some  ways\r\n\r\nparalleled those of Sun Yat Sen and Mao Tse-tung. He\r\n\r\nwas   increasingly  resentful  of  the   fact   that\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in the Party had not treated  him  as  a\r\n\r\nbudding Mao Tse-tung and acclaimed him the life  and\r\n\r\nsoul  of  the Party. He began, therefore, intriguing\r\n\r\nin  order  to  build a personal faction  inside  the\r\n\r\nParty.  And  his  favourite weapon  was  the  secret\r\n\r\nsmearing of his own colleagues. Fortunately, Sir, he\r\n\r\nwas  never a clever liar, and it was inevitable that\r\n\r\nhe  should  be found out sooner or later.  And  when\r\n\r\nmembers of the Party, some of whom had at first been\r\n\r\ntaken  in by his lies, compared notes, they  decided\r\n\r\nthat  his  lies and intrigues should be checked.  As\r\n\r\nyou know, Sir, he was subsequently expelled from the\r\n\r\nParty;  though even when he was expelled, he made  a\r\n\r\nclaim  that the P.A.P. delegates who voted  for  his\r\n\r\nexpulsion  did so because the building  in  question\r\n\r\nwas surrounded by armed secret police. This again is\r\n\r\nanother lie to get out of the previous lies  he  had\r\n\r\ntold.  So, Sir, immediately after his expulsion,  22\r\n\r\nAssemblymen signed and published a statement listing\r\n\r\nthe lies he had told them. This, in fact, formed the\r\n\r\ncore   of  the  charges  against  him.  And   again,\r\n\r\ncharacteristically he announced in the  papers  that\r\n\r\nhe  would  appear before the Party to  answer  these\r\n\r\ncharges. But as in the case of the Assembly, on  the\r\n\r\nday  fixed for the hearing, he changed his mind  and\r\n\r\nhe did not appear, and as justification he cooked up\r\n\r\na   lie  that  had  he  appeared  before  his  Party\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  he  would have been  subjected  to  the\r\n\r\nterror of a secret trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that he could not answer the charges\r\n\r\nbecause  they were true and his accusers were  there\r\n\r\nready  to  confront him with the evidence. That  was\r\n\r\nwhy  he  took no action against the Assemblymen  who\r\n\r\nhad  publicly caused to be printed in the newspapers\r\n\r\nthe  charge that he was a liar and listed  the  lies\r\n\r\nthat he had told.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore he had hoped to win a following by his\r\n\r\nso-called 16 resolutions. But even though  he  posed\r\n\r\nas  an  extreme Left-wing revolutionary, his support\r\n\r\ndid not increase. He had, therefore, to do something\r\n\r\nspectacular   to   prop  up  his  fading   political\r\n\r\nprestige.  Therefore, one assumes that  he  suddenly\r\n\r\nbecame  aware that Assembly privilege could be  used\r\n\r\nas a powerful weapon to support his fading prestige.\r\n\r\nSo he began, first in a modest way, by telling small\r\n\r\nfalsehoods against the Government and individuals in\r\n\r\nthe Party. He claimed that the P.A.P. Government was\r\n\r\nrun  by  Messrs.  Blades, Thomson  and  Meadows.  He\r\n\r\nalleged  that the P.A.P. had forgotten  the  workers\r\n\r\nand had taken to oppressing the poor. The P.A.P., he\r\n\r\nsaid,  had  become  a  tool of the  Right-wing.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P., he said, was no longer anti-colonial because\r\n\r\nit  did  not  demand  an  independent  Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nnotice, Sir, that since the resignation of Mr  Ong,\r\n\r\nthis slogan of an independent Singapore has now been\r\n\r\ntaken  up  by  the  fireside revolutionary  and  the\r\n\r\nwoolly  anti-colonialist from the  S.P.A.  - Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChoon  Mong. It is a historical fate, Sir, that  all\r\n\r\nopportunists become informers for the Right-wing and\r\n\r\nsubsequently their ignominious tool. It is only  the\r\n\r\nRight-wing which is openly championing Mr Ong.  His\r\n\r\nsupport  has  come exclusively from the  Right-wing.\r\n\r\nNot  a single progressive organisation has supported\r\n\r\nhim. They have, instead, supported the P.A.P. simply\r\n\r\nbecause,  for  all Mr Ong's falsehoods,  they  know\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. does not cheat the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mr Ong's falsehoods in this Assembly did not\r\n\r\nhelp  him  very  much. After nearly  six  months  of\r\n\r\nemploying  this campaign of lies, his  only  visible\r\n\r\nmeans of support were the Members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Aljunied  and Punggol. That  was,  for  him,  a\r\n\r\ndepressing thought. He had, therefore, to indulge in\r\n\r\nbolder  and  more spectacular lies, and what  better\r\n\r\nlie than a charge of nepotism against two Ministers?\r\n\r\nHad  he been allowed to get away with this, then  we\r\n\r\nare quite certain that he would have been encouraged\r\n\r\nto  spread  new  lies under the  cloak  of  Assembly\r\n\r\nprivilege. For he had nothing to lose. If  his  lies\r\n\r\nwere  not believed, he had nothing to lose.  But  by\r\n\r\npersisting  in  baseless smears and allegations,  he\r\n\r\nhoped  that some of his lies would be believed.  The\r\n\r\nfact that his smears injured innocent people outside\r\n\r\nthe Assembly was no concern to Mr Ong. These people\r\n\r\ncould  not hit back as he had the further protection\r\n\r\nof  Assembly  privilege if they dared to  hit  back.\r\n\r\nSuch  conduct is, in our view, dishonourable and  in\r\n\r\nthe  long run will bring democracy into contempt and\r\n\r\nridicule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know which way the Opposition is going\r\n\r\nto vote on this motion, and we do not care. However,\r\n\r\nthey  will  agree  on one thing. It  was  worthwhile\r\n\r\nwaiting  for the Inquiry Commission's Report  before\r\n\r\nproceeding  with the by-election in  Hong  Lim.  The\r\n\r\nReport makes it clear that the \"Opposition's battle\"\r\n\r\nwill  be  fought in Hong Lim by a man who cannot  be\r\n\r\ntrusted, by a man who would not hesitate to tell  an\r\n\r\nuntruth if it suited him. Beggars, Sir, it is  said,\r\n\r\ncannot   be   choosers.  The  Right-wing   may   not\r\n\r\nsympathise with Mr Ong, but they have no choice but\r\n\r\nto  unite in support of him. Mr Ong, for his  part,\r\n\r\nmay  not  have  a  high regard  for  his  Right-wing\r\n\r\npatrons,  but  he  cannot  afford  to  spurn   their\r\n\r\npatronage.  It is simply a question of he  and  they\r\n\r\neither  hanging together or hanging separately.  Our\r\n\r\nguess  and  hope is that they will hang together  in\r\n\r\nHong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to join issue with the Minister for Culture.

Perhaps, Sir, the allegation\r\n\r\nwas  made in the heat of the moment, or perhaps  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has still some more things to  learn\r\n\r\nin life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have also some more\r\n\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is reported too again on\r\n\r\npage   7,  column  2  of  this  paper - this  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong said that when he was Mr Lee's friend\r\n\r\neverything was all right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee interposed that Mr Ong had never been his friend but only his political colleague. As\r\n\r\nsuch,  every  wrong that Mr Ong did  he  concealed\r\n\r\nfrom  the  public  because he had  to  protect  the\r\n\r\nunity and solidarity of the party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said he knew Mr Ong was trying to make Mr P.\r\n\r\nC. Marcus a scapegoat but \"we protected you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declaring that \"we never bite our own friends,\"\r\n\r\nMr  Lee  said  it was only after  Mr  Ong  turned renegade that he decided to fight him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Because Mr Ong was a colleague at that time,  every\r\n\r\nwrong that he did, the Prime Minister concealed from\r\n\r\nthe public. The public will remember that during the\r\n\r\nterm  of  office  of  the  previous  Government,   a\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry was appointed to  investigate\r\n\r\ninto the wrongful acts of the then Mayor of the City\r\n\r\nCouncil. The Prime Minister defended Mr Ong because\r\n\r\nhe  was then a colleague and covered up for him. The\r\n\r\nthen  Mayor was charged for doing grievous wrong  in\r\n\r\nthe  City Council. The Prime Minister said that  the\r\n\r\nthen  Mayor, then his colleague and the hero of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  was  a  great man and had  done  many  good\r\n\r\nthings  in  the City Council. And now, Sir,  because\r\n\r\nMr  Ong turned renegade, the Prime Minister decided\r\n\r\nto  fight  him and to expose him. It is now admitted\r\n\r\nby the Prime Minister that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen Mayor, now no longer his beloved colleague, had\r\n\r\ndone  grievous wrong in the City Council. This, Sir,\r\n\r\nmust  be  another election \"trick\" that won the  day\r\n\r\nfor  the  P.A.P. during the last general  elections.\r\n\r\nMr Ong at that time was acclaimed by the P.A.P. as\r\n\r\na  great  leader,  a great hero, and  that  under  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government the people would have a wonderful\r\n\r\ngovernment  that  would look  after  the  poor.  And\r\n\r\nbecause Mr Ong Eng Guan had been made use of  as  a\r\n\r\ngreat hero during the general elections in 1959,  it\r\n\r\nwas  therefore justified for Mr Ong to claim in the\r\n\r\nCommission that he was helping Mr Lee to become the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the previous Government appointed the\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry which I referred to earlier in\r\n\r\nmy  speech, the Prime Minister accused the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment,  saying that this act  was  a  political\r\n\r\nmove  against the P.A.P., in view of the forthcoming\r\n\r\nelections.  What  about  the present  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  into  Mr  Ong  Eng Guan?  Did  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment not say and confirm it today that the\r\n\r\nby-election would only be held after the Report of  the\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry was debated in this  Assembly?\r\n\r\nSir, we do not hold the view - although it is held  by\r\n\r\nmany  people  and particularly by the electorate  of\r\n\r\nHong Lim - that this is a political move against  Mr\r\n\r\nOng Eng Guan. We do not hold this view, Sir, because\r\n\r\ninasmuch as the P.A.P. Government want to claim that\r\n\r\nthe  Commission  of Inquiry appointed  by  them  has\r\n\r\nnothing to do with attacking the political integrity\r\n\r\nof  an  opponent who may appear on the scene in  the\r\n\r\nHong   Lim   by-election,  the  previous  Government\r\n\r\nclaimed the same thing - it was not a political  move\r\n\r\naimed  at  the  P.A.P.; it was just a Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry appointed to expose the wrongful acts of the\r\n\r\nthen  Mayor  of the City Council. What the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  did was wrong, so said the  P.A.P.,  but\r\n\r\nwhat  the P.A.P. Government do now, although it  may\r\n\r\nbe  the  same  as  what the previous Government  did\r\n\r\nthen,  is right because it is a good, clean,  honest\r\n\r\nGovernment!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this leads me to quote another instance of\r\n\r\nthis kind of double talk. In 1959 before the general\r\n\r\nelections,  there  was a fire at  Tiong  Bahru.  The\r\n\r\nprevious  Government showed sympathy  for  the  fire\r\n\r\nvictims  and gave them temporary Trust accommodation\r\n\r\nfree of rent. But what did the P.A.P. say then? \"The\r\n\r\nGovernment is making political capital out of  these\r\n\r\nfire   victims.   They   should   not   have   given\r\n\r\naccommodation free of rent to the fire victims.\" Two\r\n\r\ndays  ago,  a  fire took place at  Upper  Chin  Chew\r\n\r\nStreet.  And what is the P.A.P. Government going  to\r\n\r\ndo?  They  are going to give accommodation  free  of\r\n\r\nrent  to  the  fire victims too. What  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment did was wrong, so said the P.A.P., but what\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government do now, although it may be the\r\n\r\nsame  as  what the previous Government did then,  is\r\n\r\ncorrect and grand because the P.A.P. Government is a\r\n\r\ngood, honest, clean Government!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this paper of 31st January seems to disclose\r\n\r\na  lot of facts. This is important too because it is\r\n\r\nlevelled at me. The last two lines in column  7  and\r\n\r\nthe first two lines in column 8 of page 5 read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Lee then said Mr Ong had a chat with Tun Lim\r\n\r\nYew  Hock, who alerted him and then Mr Ong did  not\r\n\r\nturn up.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, this is an untruth although it has been said by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister under oath. I did not alert  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng Guan. Why should I? On that particular day,\r\n\r\nI  was looking forward to seeing the Government take\r\n\r\nan   unfair   advantage,  with  their   overwhelming\r\n\r\nmajority,  over their ex-beloved hero and colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim at that time, by tabling  a\r\n\r\nsurprise  motion the terms of which have  caused  so\r\n\r\nmuch  talk in Singapore and elsewhere. What happened\r\n\r\nwas this, Sir, and this is the truth and nothing but\r\n\r\nthe  truth. On that particular day, my colleague the\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park and I saw the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nin  the  Library  at  his request.  He  told  us  in\r\n\r\nconfidence - and I would not have mentioned it here if\r\n\r\nmy name had not been brought up in the Commission of\r\n\r\nInquiry - that the Government proposed to introduce  a\r\n\r\nsurprise motion against Mr Ong Eng Guan. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  still with him when the State Advocate-General\r\n\r\ncame  in  with a draft and we had a look at  it.  We\r\n\r\nwere asked by the Prime Minister about our stand and\r\n\r\nwere  told that he had to get a clearance  from  you\r\n\r\nfor  dispensing of notice. I consulted my colleagues\r\n\r\nand  I  then conveyed our answer to the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in  the  C.P.A.  Room  because  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister then was busy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan witnessed considerable activity on the part of P.A.P. Assemblymen. He saw them going\r\n\r\ninto  the  Committee  room,  closeted,  talking  and\r\n\r\nwhispering, and you yourself were seen to leave your\r\n\r\nChair to go to your room obviously for consultation.\r\n\r\nMr  Ong was in the Opposition Room. He sent a  chit\r\n\r\nto  me  while I was sitting here, saying, \"Tun  Lim,\r\n\r\nwould  you please come out and see me?\" I  went  and\r\n\r\nsaw him in the Opposition Room. He told me, first of\r\n\r\nall,  that he sensed that something was in  the  air\r\n\r\nbecause  of  what  he had seen  and  what  had  been\r\n\r\nreported  to  him, and he asked me  whether  I  knew\r\n\r\nanything.   As   I   received  the  information   in\r\n\r\nconfidence, I therefore could not say yes.  I  said,\r\n\r\nno,  I  had no knowledge. The Minister for Education\r\n\r\nfelt that I should not have kept that confidence.  I\r\n\r\nsaid, no, I had no knowledge. \"Yes, but you know Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker  went twice into his room.\" I said, \"If  you\r\n\r\nare  so  concerned, go and see the Speaker.\"  So  he\r\n\r\nwent to see you, Mr Speaker, and I do not know what\r\n\r\ntook place, but he came out and later on he told me,\r\n\r\n\"I say, this P.A.P. terrible, man. They want to move\r\n\r\na  surprise  motion  against me.  But  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nanyway,  gentleman; he won't allow  it.\"  But,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  Mr Ong Eng Guan had that talk with me, I  was\r\n\r\nreally  embarrassed and then I had to go running  to\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy Prime Minister and say, \"I say, Dr Toh,\r\n\r\nthis surprise motion of yours may be no surprise.  I\r\n\r\nhave  been  grilled by Mr Ong Eng Guan. Although  I\r\n\r\nhave  told  him  nothing, he is  going  to  see  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.\"  So if there was anybody who was  alerted,\r\n\r\nmay  I  suggest  that it was the  P.A.P. which  was\r\n\r\nalerted by me to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that the surprise motion was no longer  a\r\n\r\nsurprise  motion, because Mr Ong Eng  Guan  already\r\n\r\nknew that something was coming up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Opposition holds no brief for Mr Ong Eng\r\n\r\nGuan - and I repeat it here - we hold no brief  for  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng  Guan. In fact, we consider he has  done  a\r\n\r\ngreat  disservice to the country by discharging  his\r\n\r\nduties as Mayor in the City Council in such a manner\r\n\r\nas  to  make the people feel that the P.A.P. was  a\r\n\r\nvery   good  Party - which  it  is  not  - and  thereby\r\n\r\npiloting  the P.A.P. into power in the 1959  general\r\n\r\nelections.  How can we have sympathy or love  for  a\r\n\r\nman  who  we  feel  has  done a  disservice  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry?  He  happened  to  be  a  Member   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You want him to fight the battle for\r\n\r\nthe Opposition!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Therefore, Sir,-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> But you say-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

So I did not\r\n\r\nalert  Mr  Ong Eng Guan, and I hope that statements\r\n\r\nsaid here in all sincerity and in all truth would be\r\n\r\naccepted.  I would not want to alert him even  if  I\r\n\r\nwere asked to alert him, or even if I were asked  by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister to convey it to him. I would not\r\n\r\nhave  done  it. We were going to enjoy the spectacle\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. Government doing something that could\r\n\r\nbe   described  later  on - outside  and  inside  this\r\n\r\nAssembly - as a most undemocratic act. We did not have\r\n\r\nto alert Mr Ong Eng Guan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this motion we are asked to take note of\r\n\r\nthe Report of the Inquiry Commission. The Opposition\r\n\r\ntakes note that the Inquiry Commission has been  the\r\n\r\nforum where character assassination was the order of\r\n\r\nthe  day.  The  Opposition further takes  note  that\r\n\r\nbecause   of   this  character  assassination   (the\r\n\r\ndramatis  personae being the Prime  Minister  versus\r\n\r\nthe ex-Mayor of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCity   council,   the   ex-Minister   for   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  the  ex-hero and ex-colleague  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  the ex-Member for Hong Lim) it has done  no\r\n\r\ngood  to  anybody, not even to the  country.  May  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  to the P.A.P. that the sooner all  this  is\r\n\r\npushed  aside, the better it will be for  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand the more time and energy Government will have to\r\n\r\ndischarge  their primary duty of looking  after  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of the people of Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the second part of the motion.\r\n\r\nWe  are  asked to condemn Mr Ong Eng Guan \"for  his\r\n\r\ndishonourable  conduct  unbecoming  of  an   elected\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the people\". But where is Mr  Ong\r\n\r\nEng  Guan for us to condemn? He is not here. He  has\r\n\r\nresigned. And because he has resigned, we feel  that\r\n\r\nhe has paid sufficient atonement for whatever wrongs\r\n\r\nhe  might  have done to the dignity of  this  House.\r\n\r\nSir,   we  do  not  countenance  such  dishonourable\r\n\r\nconduct  and,  if I remember rightly,  we  have  had\r\n\r\noccasion  to  hear speeches made in  this  House  by\r\n\r\ncertain Members on the Government side bordering  on\r\n\r\nsuch conduct. I know now we all do not want any more\r\n\r\nof  it,  and we are glad. As stated by you, Sir,  in\r\n\r\nyour  speech from the Chair at the last sitting,  we\r\n\r\nfeel that a Sessional Committee of Privileges should\r\n\r\nbe  appointed immediately, a Committee which can  be\r\n\r\nentrusted  with the duty of maintaining the  dignity\r\n\r\nof  this  House  and disciplining  any  Member  from\r\n\r\neither  side  of  the  House for  any  dishonourable\r\n\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the Minister for Culture has found it\r\n\r\nnecessary to make a pre-election speech, this motion\r\n\r\nhas  therefore  taken  on a political  significance,\r\n\r\nparticularly  as the by-election in  Hong  Lim  will\r\n\r\ntake  place soon. We are not interested in this \r\n\r\nby-election. We know, and the public know, that  it  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be a grudge fight between two groups in the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. And because it is a grudge fight, and because\r\n\r\nwe  have no sympathy for the contending parties,  we\r\n\r\nsay, \"May the less - worse man win\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of what I have spoken and in\r\n\r\nanswer  to  the  query raised by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture, the Opposition will abstain on this motion.\r\n\r\nThe  Opposition and the public take  note  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture has said  on  behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government that they could not care less  how\r\n\r\nwe vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on the subject for discussion\r\n\r\nby  us  today, I am surprised that even  before  all\r\n\r\nMembers  of the Opposition have risen to speak,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture has charged that he  does  not\r\n\r\ncare  less which way we vote. I would like to stress\r\n\r\nthat I do not care a damn what happens to the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nIf  the P.A.P. is not interested in our stand, there\r\n\r\nwill  come a time when the P.A.P. will take heed  of\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.'s vote, particularly the Singapore U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, really I do not wish to speak or participate in this debate. It is not because of the\r\n\r\nfasting  month or because I am weak. It was  not  my\r\n\r\nintention  to speak originally because I  know  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  fight  between two factions,  each  one\r\n\r\nwanting  more power, with the result that  one  side\r\n\r\nwill  become a victim. So whichever side  becomes  a\r\n\r\nvictim, we are not interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to emphasise once again, and especially to the Minister for Culture, that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  attempt to threaten  us,  particularly\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. as  the Opposition. If we are intimidated,\r\n\r\nthere  will  come a time when our services  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired.  For  instance, what had the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to the Minister for National  Development\r\n\r\ndone at the time when there was tension which nearly\r\n\r\nprecipitated  a  clash between the Chinese  and  the\r\n\r\nMalays?  He  invited U.M.N.O. to hold a  meeting.  A\r\n\r\nmeeting was held and it finally resolved to  put  an\r\n\r\nend to the tension. We did not like to take part  in\r\n\r\nthat  matter, but bearing in mind that we wished  to\r\n\r\nco-operate with the Government, we decided  to  make\r\n\r\nan appeal through the radio. And on this matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore  us  today, even before we have declared  our\r\n\r\nstand,   we  have  already  been  accused   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not wish to comment on Mr Ong Eng Guan. But I would like to say that Mr Ong Eng\r\n\r\nGuan  is  an  ex-member of the P.A.P. who  had  been\r\n\r\ninstrumental  in  creating  disunity  in   Singapore\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. The reason why I say this is that  when  he\r\n\r\nwas  the Mayor there were many U.M.N.O. members  who\r\n\r\nowed  a  debt  of gratitude to Mr Ong Eng  Guan  by\r\n\r\nbecoming teachers in the Malay classes conducted  in\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council.  By this  act  of  Mr  Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan - helping  U.M.N.O. members - he  directly  became\r\n\r\nresponsible for the break-up of U.M.N.O. members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Mr Speaker, this  is\r\n\r\nstill fresh in my memory - I was not a Member of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly in the past Government - when we demanded the\r\n\r\nGovernment to release the Nadra detainees,  we  were\r\n\r\nintimidated, not me but the Member for-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member has been\r\n\r\nirrelevant,  but  I have allowed  him  to  carry  on\r\n\r\nbecause of the allegations made by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture. But I think I must now pull him back to the\r\n\r\nmotion. The motion is merely a motion to condemn Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng  Guan in the light of the findings  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on the\r\n\r\nwhole,  although I consider Mr Ong Eng Guan  did  a\r\n\r\nlot of good things in the City Council, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy view now that he has clearly demonstrated that he\r\n\r\ncould fight and join the ranks of the Opposition and\r\n\r\nexpose  to  the  people of Singapore the  goings-on,\r\n\r\nwhether  in  the Party or in the government  of  the\r\n\r\nday.  Therefore,  Mr Speaker, U.M.N.O.  Members  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly hold the same view as expressed by the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill, that is, we will not make\r\n\r\npre-election speeches as have been made in this Assembly\r\n\r\njust now, and we will not participate nor join hands\r\n\r\nwith  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan when he contests  the  \r\n\r\nby-election in Hong Lim. However, we would like to  see\r\n\r\nMr Ong Eng Guan returned as an Opposition Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam (Acting Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Ong Chang Sam)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the Opposition have expressed  their\r\n\r\nviews. It is very clear that at today's sitting,  we\r\n\r\ncan  see that they have united together as one  team\r\n\r\ntoday.  Before the tabling of this Report  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill fully supported Mr  Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan.  But after the Report has been tabled, he  has\r\n\r\nfound that all the facts contained in the Report are\r\n\r\ntrue,  and what the former Member for Hong  Lim  had\r\n\r\nsaid was all false. That is why in his speech he has\r\n\r\nexpressed the view that he will abstain from  voting\r\n\r\non   our  motion.  This  clearly  shows  that   when\r\n\r\nconfronted  with a fight, the Opposition still  want\r\n\r\nto  support the former Member for Hong Lim.  In  his\r\n\r\nspeech the Member for Cairnhill did not mention  the\r\n\r\nfacts contained in the Report. He dared not deny the\r\n\r\nfacts in the Report. He cannot say that the findings\r\n\r\nof  the  Report  were not true.  Therefore,  we  can\r\n\r\nclearly  point out that the tabling of  this  Report\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  very  good  thing  for  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  for  all the people  concerned.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, we are fortunate that in this Assembly\r\n\r\ntoday,  we  can discuss the Report of the Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry into the allegations made by Mr Ong Eng\r\n\r\nGuan  in  the Legislative Assembly on the  10th  and\r\n\r\n12th December, 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, this House must express its thanks to Mr\r\n\r\nJustice  Chua for his work, because he has fulfilled\r\n\r\nhis  task  in  a very short time. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is  the  first  time in  the  history  of  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  system that we have  taken  steps  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  a  Member of this Assembly for  uttering\r\n\r\ncertain  unfounded allegations. I hope this will  be\r\n\r\nthe  last time that this sort of thing will  happen.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we  do  not have a very  long  history  in\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy,  the  facts  have  clearly\r\n\r\nshown  to us that we can fully utilise the  one  man\r\n\r\none  vote  system. There will be no danger  in  this\r\n\r\nsystem,  and we can fully utilise it to develop  the\r\n\r\nspirit of democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few months, this\r\n\r\nHouse  has become a dirty pool, because the speeches\r\n\r\nof the ex-Member for Hong Lim had blinded the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, so that they have expressed doubts on\r\n\r\nthe sincerity of the Government. In an editorial  in\r\n\r\nthe  Sin  Chew  Jit  Poh  of  27th  February,  1961,\r\n\r\nregarding the political lesson of the Ong  Eng  Guan\r\n\r\nincident,  in the last part of paragraph  4,  it  is\r\n\r\nstated thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Frankly speaking, these political storms' have\r\n\r\nshaken  the faith of the people of Singapore in  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  system and the future  of  democratic\r\n\r\nself-government. If this House does  not  resort  to\r\n\r\neffective measures, then our democratic system  will\r\n\r\nbecome a laughing stock.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The editorial continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Justice Chua has been appointed as\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of  the Inquiry. The  purpose  of  his\r\n\r\nappointment  is  to clarify the confused  situation.\r\n\r\nHis report which has been tabled can be said to have\r\n\r\nfulfilled this task.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the suction pump and filter have\r\n\r\nnow  cleansed the whole pool of dirty water, so that\r\n\r\nthe  stones and gravel at the bottom have  come  out\r\n\r\nclearly, and the people of Hong Lim now clearly  see\r\n\r\nthe  character  of the ex-Member for  Hong  Lim.  If\r\n\r\nnecessary we will disclose more facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Opposition Members have\r\n\r\nbeen shouting about freedom of speech and freedom of\r\n\r\nthe  Press. They have made speeches to that  effect.\r\n\r\nThey  think  that the censuring of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nusing  the privilege of the Assembly as a cloak  for\r\n\r\nspreading  false rumours is undemocratic.  And  they\r\n\r\nare against this. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Leader\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the House, when moving his motion, clearly  said\r\n\r\nthat  this  motion  was  not  directed  specifically\r\n\r\nagainst  an  individual, but it was related  to  the\r\n\r\nwhole Assembly. But you, Mr Speaker, at the sitting\r\n\r\non the 19th of December, 1960, before the motion was\r\n\r\nproposed  by  the  Deputy Prime  Minister,  you  had\r\n\r\nstressed that the motion was not directed against an\r\n\r\nindividual,  but  it concerned  the  Assembly  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole,  because the protection of freedom of  speech\r\n\r\nof  Assemblymen does not mean that the Assembly will\r\n\r\nallow  them  to abuse this privilege with  impunity.\r\n\r\nThe  President of Indonesia, Dr Soekarno, has  said\r\n\r\nthat  freedom of speech and legal sanction  are  not\r\n\r\nseparable.  They are complementary  to  each  other,\r\n\r\nlike body and soul. Like all other kinds of freedom,\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  speech  is not absolute.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nfreedom   of  unprincipled  speech.  This  kind   of\r\n\r\nunprincipled   speech  will   interfere   with   the\r\n\r\nharmonious development of freedom in other respects.\r\n\r\nIt will tend to hamper the harmonious development of\r\n\r\nfreedom,  and  this will sow the seed of  discontent\r\n\r\nand  the  seed of destruction for freedom.  I  think\r\n\r\nhon.  Members here will all agree to this saying  of\r\n\r\nPresident Soekarno.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the ex-Member for Hong Lim, Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng Guan, utilised the privilege of this  House\r\n\r\nas  a cloak to cover up his falsehoods. He cunningly\r\n\r\nutilised  all kinds of falsehoods, shouting exciting\r\n\r\nslogans and making unreasonable allegations for  his\r\n\r\nown  purposes. In his dying struggle he would  catch\r\n\r\nat  any straw. But paper tigers and brass rings will\r\n\r\nnot  endure  the  true test. In the  end,  the  true\r\n\r\nnature  of  such people will be disclosed  and  they\r\n\r\nwill be despised by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Ong Eng Guan put up a\r\n\r\nLeft-wing  flag,  showing that he was  on  the  Left.  He\r\n\r\nwalked  up and down the street selling his political\r\n\r\nballyhoo, shouting all day long-shouting slogans  to\r\n\r\nthe  effect that he was for the benefit of the  poor\r\n\r\npeople  and down with the yellow culture  and  \r\n\r\nanti-colonialism. He was crying as though heaven and  the\r\n\r\nsky  would fall down. And he tried to show  that  he\r\n\r\nalone was the only person who was capable of leading\r\n\r\nthe people to see\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  sun  and  sky again. But he has forgotten  that\r\n\r\ntime  is  the best test, the best witness.  A  paper\r\n\r\ntiger, after the rain and the wind, after the  trial\r\n\r\nof  temperature, will in the end disclose  its  true\r\n\r\nnature and true appearance, and it will show that it\r\n\r\nis  only  a  shattered framework, and nothing  else.\r\n\r\nBrass  rings cannot endure the heat of the  furnace.\r\n\r\nThey will melt. Mr Ong's anti-yellow culture became\r\n\r\nhis  stumbling-block. He claimed himself  to  be  an\r\n\r\nanti-colonialist. But this has in the end turned out\r\n\r\nto  show  that he is a reactionary and a  Right-wing\r\n\r\nadventurer. Now he knows full well that the workers,\r\n\r\nhawkers  and farmers have all come to know  that  he\r\n\r\nhas  been  lying in the past. These  people  do  not\r\n\r\nsupport  him. He knows this fact clearly. Therefore,\r\n\r\nhis only lifebuoy is the ex-Chief Minister, the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill, and the hon. Member  for  Joo\r\n\r\nChiat, Mr David Marshall, and Mrs Leon-Soh and  so\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this type of internal contradiction of Mr Ong\r\n\r\nEng  Guan  is  not  like what Mr Mao  Tse-tung  has\r\n\r\nwritten   in   his  book  regarding   the   internal\r\n\r\ncontradiction of the people. On the  one  hand,  he\r\n\r\ntaps  on  the  shoulders  of  the  hawkers  and  the\r\n\r\nworkers, but on the other hand, he shakes hands with\r\n\r\nthe  Right-wing  group - coming to terms  with  them.\r\n\r\nThis  action  will be disclosed by  the  passage  of\r\n\r\ntime.    Mr    Speaker,   Sir,   those   Right-wing\r\n\r\nreactionaries have all spoken in support of Mr  Ong\r\n\r\nEng  Guan.  They have protested strongly. They  have\r\n\r\nthought  that with this they can unite  together  to\r\n\r\nbeat  the  P.A.P. so that they can have a  political\r\n\r\ncome-back. Mr Ong Eng Guan has also given his  full\r\n\r\nsupport and co-operation to this group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been silent on their speeches and\r\n\r\nstatements. He thinks that the unity and strength of\r\n\r\nthe  Right-wing group can beat the Left-wing  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nBut  unfortunately, Mr Ong Eng Guan  has  forgotten\r\n\r\nthe  fact that the eyes of the people are bright and\r\n\r\ndiscerning. His coming to terms with the  Right-wing\r\n\r\ngroup  cannot avoid the future events that are going\r\n\r\nto happen to him. It is just like paper which cannot\r\n\r\nwrap up fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that Mr Justice Chua's Report has been tabled\r\n\r\nin  this House, the facts are put clearly before the\r\n\r\npeople.  Mr Speaker, Sir, let me read out paragraph\r\n\r\n43 of this Report. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I find that there is no truth at all in any of\r\n\r\nthe  three  allegations made by Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan.\r\n\r\nThese allegations are groundless and recklessly made\r\n\r\nand  there  is  no justification for making  any  of\r\n\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is black has now been clearly shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. KANDASAMY) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the hon. Member for Cairnhill still speak for\r\n\r\nMr Ong Eng Guan? Will the hon. Member for Joo Chiat\r\n\r\nstill act as an adviser to Mr Ong Eng Guan? We will\r\n\r\nask them this. Does Mr David Marshall still want to\r\n\r\nbecome  a  supporter of Mr Ong Eng Guan? Does  Mrs\r\n\r\nLeon-Soh still want to protest for Mr Ong Eng Guan?\r\n\r\nWe will be glad if they can come forward and have  a\r\n\r\ndebate  with us at Mr Ong Eng Guan's mass  meeting;\r\n\r\nor  do  they want to meet us in Hong Lim? We welcome\r\n\r\nand will gladly accept that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wind up my speech, let me quote paragraph 15 of\r\n\r\nthis Report:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan, in the course of giving his\r\n\r\nevidence,  made statements which were  either \r\n\r\nhalf-truths  or  vague allegations with the intention  of\r\n\r\nmisleading the Commission. I find that he would tell\r\n\r\nan  untruth  when  it  suited  him.  All  the  three\r\n\r\nallegations  made  by  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan  in   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly against the Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  and  all  the\r\n\r\nallegations which he made against the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nin  the  course  of  giving  his  evidence  in  this\r\n\r\nCommission are untrue, groundless and reckless.  Mr\r\n\r\nOng Eng Guan is a person not to be believed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us put this passage clearly\r\n\r\nover to the people of Hong Lim and let them know who\r\n\r\nwill  be one of the contestants in the Hong Lim \r\n\r\nby-election; what kind of a man he is. Let us all  hope\r\n\r\nthat  this  kind  of thing will not happen  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, the Government side  has  described\r\n\r\nMr Ong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEng Guan as a person who is on terms with the\r\n\r\nRight-wing  party, but they have forgotten that last  year\r\n\r\nwhen  we  were debating the speech of the  Yang  \r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara,  that Member was  described  as  an\r\n\r\n\"extreme opportunist\". The purpose is to confuse the\r\n\r\nHong Lim electorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, just now when our Deputy Prime Minister moved the motion to censure the ex-Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong Lim, he acquired the support of the Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill. Thus, we can see very clearly who  is\r\n\r\non terms with the Right-wing party. It is clear that\r\n\r\nthe  Government Party is doing this in order to have\r\n\r\nharmonious  action against a Member elected  by  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in my view, the electorate of Hong Lim should not be censured. On the 10th and\r\n\r\n12th  of  December last year, concerning the  M.  R.\r\n\r\nMarcus and Kwa Soon Chuan affairs, the ex-Member for\r\n\r\nHong Lim used his privilege as a Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nand  as  a  Member  of the Opposition  to  give  his\r\n\r\nsuggestions,  and the Government had  the  right  to\r\n\r\nanalyse the facts clearly. The Government should not\r\n\r\nconsider his words as allegations so as to  use  the\r\n\r\nwhole Assembly to condemn him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry, because of the ex-Member for\r\n\r\nHong Lim, is just wasting time and public money.  He\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  said that he had not attempted  to  make\r\n\r\nallegations.  Therefore, is there any  need  for  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation?   The   Government   is   using   the\r\n\r\nCommission  of  Inquiry to delay the by-election  in\r\n\r\nHong Lim, so as to express their own points of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I refer to paragraph 17 of the Report of the Commission of Inquiry. The\r\n\r\nex-Administrator of the City Council, P. C.  Lim,  gave\r\n\r\nevidence  at the Inquiry. Mr Lim, appearing  before\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner, pointed out that J. L. Byrne said\r\n\r\nthe following, that he was under instructions to see\r\n\r\nMarcus. This witness was an independent witness.  He\r\n\r\nis  now in the Water Department. Unfortunately,  his\r\n\r\npoints of view were not accepted by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommission. In my view, it was impossible for J.  L.\r\n\r\nByrne  to have used those words. Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nI  do not know whether J. L. Byrne's speech was soft\r\n\r\nor  not.  It  was not clear. Or was there  something\r\n\r\nwrong?   From  this  we  can  see  that  an  Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommission,  in fact, will not come to  any  finding\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be  detrimental to  the  Government  in\r\n\r\nrespect of the coming Hong Lim by-election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Deputy Speaker, the S.P.A. has not hesitated  to\r\n\r\nexploit  the  Ong  Eng Guan issue.  They  have  paid\r\n\r\ntribute  to  Mr Ong Eng Guan by even imitating  his\r\n\r\nmethod  of  big smears, innuendoes and  half-truths.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  in a Press statement  issued  by  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the S.P.A., Mr Lim Choon Mong,\r\n\r\non  7th February, he said that \"even the absence  of\r\n\r\nthe  Party's organising secretary from Singapore  at\r\n\r\nthis crucial moment is significant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is significant? Is it suggested by Mr Lim\r\n\r\nChoon Mong that I was away from Singapore because of\r\n\r\nsome  disagreement over the motion on  Mr  Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan?  Obviously, the statement by  the  S.P.A. was\r\n\r\nintended  to imply some disagreement. Let me  assure\r\n\r\nthe  House  that I am completely with the Government\r\n\r\non  this motion condemning Mr Ong Eng Guan for  his\r\n\r\ndishonourable  conduct. Mr Lim is obviously  trying\r\n\r\nto propagate the false rumours spread by Mr Ong Eng\r\n\r\nGuan  that there are two factions in the Party  - one\r\n\r\npro-Ong  Eng Guan and the other anti-Ong  Eng  Guan.\r\n\r\nLet  me  say that there are no two such factions  in\r\n\r\nthe  Party. There is only one faction - the pro-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the essence of democracy is rule by consent through the Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nelected  by the people. The Assembly is the  highest\r\n\r\nlegislative  body  of the State  where  the  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people sit and deliberate  on\r\n\r\nissues  vital to the people's interest. It  follows,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that the Assembly should  be  given  the\r\n\r\nhighest respect if it is to be entrusted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the fate of the 1\ufffd million population. How  can\r\n\r\nthe  people  have  confidence in  democracy  if  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly is reduced to a status  where,\r\n\r\ninstead  of debating issues of State, malicious  and\r\n\r\nunfounded falsehoods are uttered to injure  unjustly\r\n\r\ninnocent   persons  both  within  and  without   the\r\n\r\nAssembly? If these flagrant abuses of privileges are\r\n\r\nnot  checked  and freedom to spread lies  prevented,\r\n\r\nthen  the  elected Assembly would  be  brought  into\r\n\r\ncontempt and ridicule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, no one who has an interest to see that the democratic system of government should\r\n\r\nwork smoothly and effectively can oppose the motion.\r\n\r\nAs  other Members have put it, the issue before  the\r\n\r\nHouse  is  whether the privileges  of  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nshould  be  abused in spreading unfounded falsehoods\r\n\r\nand  whether  the freedom of speech in the  Assembly\r\n\r\nincludes the freedom to tell lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I have no hesitation in giving my unqualified support to the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's motion in condemning Mr Ong Eng Guan for\r\n\r\nhis  dishonourable conduct unbecoming of an  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the people in that  he  repeatedly\r\n\r\nused  his privilege in this Assembly as a cloak  for\r\n\r\nspreading  malicious falsehoods to  unjustly  injure\r\n\r\ninnocent  persons  both  inside  and  outside   this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I also rise to support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the ground has already been covered by\r\n\r\nspeeches  so  far,  but this is  such  an  important\r\n\r\nmatter  that  it  bears  repetition.  Now  that  the\r\n\r\nInquiry  Commission's Report on the  allegations  of\r\n\r\nMr  Ong  Eng Guan has been published, it is crystal\r\n\r\nclear  that  Mr  Ong Eng Guan, whilst  he  was  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong  Lim,  had  repeatedly  used   his\r\n\r\nprivilege  in this Assembly as a cloak for spreading\r\n\r\nmalicious  falsehoods  to unjustly  injure  innocent\r\n\r\npeople.  At this point, Sir, may I answer, first  of\r\n\r\nall,  the Member for Punggol who happens to be  out?\r\n\r\nHe  said  that the Inquiry was a waste of  time  and\r\n\r\npublic money. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink  all of us agree on that. To a certain extent,\r\n\r\nit  is  true, but let us also ask, who was the  real\r\n\r\ncause  for  all this? No other person than  Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan himself. And then the hon. Member also remarked\r\n\r\nthat  Ong  Eng Guan was accused of being a Left-wing\r\n\r\nadventurer  and  now  a Right-winger.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nposition  has not been made very clear to  him.  The\r\n\r\nreal  thing is that Ong Eng Guan merely posed  as  a\r\n\r\nLeft-winger but, at the present moment, he is  being\r\n\r\nmade  use  of  by  the Right-wing. If  you  want  to\r\n\r\nclassify  Ong  Eng Guan, then he is  nowhere - neither\r\n\r\nhere  nor  there.  He is only an opportunist - nothing\r\n\r\nmore  than that. The Report anyway has categorically\r\n\r\nand  conclusively stated that there is no  substance\r\n\r\nin the allegations of Mr Ong Eng Guan. Further, the\r\n\r\nReport  states that all the allegations made against\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour  and\r\n\r\nLaw are untrue, groundless and reckless. Mr Ong Eng\r\n\r\nGuan  is  a person not to be believed. Even  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of giving his evidence, Mr Ong Eng Guan made\r\n\r\nstatements  which were either half-truths  or  vague\r\n\r\nallegations  with  the intention of  misleading  the\r\n\r\nCommission.  The Commission found that Mr  Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan would tell an untruth when it suited him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are facts which have been known to us\r\n\r\nfor a long, long time and now they are borne out  by\r\n\r\nthe Report which bears the stamp of authority of  an\r\n\r\nindependent  High Court Judge. It only  remains  for\r\n\r\nus,  who  are Members of this House, to protect  and\r\n\r\nuphold the dignity and prestige of the Assembly.  It\r\n\r\nis  up  to  us,  who  are  Members  of  this  august\r\n\r\nAssembly,  to  see  to it that  no  one  abuses  the\r\n\r\nprivilege of the House as a cloak to injure unjustly\r\n\r\ninnocent  people. The allegations of  Ong  Eng  Guan\r\n\r\nwere  especially  sinister in  that  he  made  those\r\n\r\nallegations in the form of half-truths. He gave  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that  he  had the inside  dope  but  was\r\n\r\nprevented  from  spilling the beans because  of  the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Secrets Ordinance. However, an undertaking\r\n\r\nin the widest terms possible was given by Government\r\n\r\nthat  no  action whatsoever would be  taken  against\r\n\r\nanyone who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  revealed  information before  or  would  reveal\r\n\r\ninformation during the Inquiry. Mr Ong Eng Guan had\r\n\r\nbeen  given  all  facilities to bring  out  all  the\r\n\r\nsecrets most damaging to the Government, but he only\r\n\r\nshowed  that he could tell lies even in the  witness\r\n\r\nbox.  He showed his trump card. All he could say  in\r\n\r\ndefence  was that he did not understand the  meaning\r\n\r\nof  the  word \"allegation\". Truly, Sir, and I  quote\r\n\r\npage 6, paragraph i5, from line 3 of the Report:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I find that he [that is, Ong Eng Guan] would tell\r\n\r\nan untruth when it suited him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  all  this merely reveals to what opportunistic\r\n\r\nlengths  Mr  Ong  Eng Guan would  go  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  his own selfish ends. He was expelled  from\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P., and in vengeance he set about to destroy\r\n\r\nthe Party by means of a systematic campaign of smear\r\n\r\nand vilification of the leaders of the Party and the\r\n\r\nGovernment. He had hoped to tarnish the good name of\r\n\r\nthese  leaders. Of course, this would mean the  loss\r\n\r\nof  the trust and confidence the people have in  the\r\n\r\nParty   and   the  Government.  If  the   diabolical\r\n\r\nmachinations had succeeded, it would ultimately have\r\n\r\nmeant  the fall of the P.A.P. Government,  in  which\r\n\r\ncase,  as I have mentioned before in this House,  it\r\n\r\nwould  have  meant not just one by-election  in  one\r\n\r\nconstituency   but   a  general   election   in   51\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  Probably that is one  of  the  main\r\n\r\nreasons  why the Opposition are secretly  supporting\r\n\r\nMr  Ong  Eng  Guan. It may sound  trite,  Sir,  but\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy is on trial in all the newly\r\n\r\nindependent and semi-independent countries  in  this\r\n\r\npart of the world. Where parliamentary democracy has\r\n\r\nfailed,   it  has  almost  been  entirely   due   to\r\n\r\ninefficiency, nepotism and corruption. Examples  are\r\n\r\nnot far to seek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the P.A.P. have pledged ourselves to\r\n\r\ndemocratic  socialism. To make democratic  socialism\r\n\r\nwork,  we  need  above  all  a  clean,  honest   and\r\n\r\nefficient  government. Whatever the  faults  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., we are all proud that we on this side of the\r\n\r\nHouse  are clean and honest. Comparisons are  odious\r\n\r\nbut\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou  will  recall, Sir, that we had a  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  in  the past Lim Yew Hock Government  who\r\n\r\nturned  a  miner  after he fled the country  with  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial loot. Which brings my attention  to  the\r\n\r\nintriguing way the Opposition has reacted all  along\r\n\r\nto  Mr Ong Eng Guan's allegations in this Assembly.\r\n\r\nYou  will  recall  also, Sir, that  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAljunied  had  called for an early by-election.  The\r\n\r\nOpposition  not only supported the early by-election\r\n\r\nbefore the truth of the allegations was established,\r\n\r\nbut went a step further and made statements that Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng  Guan  was  fighting  the  battle  for  the\r\n\r\nOpposition. We all know why the S.P.A. will  not  be\r\n\r\ncontesting the forthcoming by-election. It has  been\r\n\r\nabundantly  clear that Mr Ong Eng Guan is  fighting\r\n\r\nthe  battle  of  the S.P.A. and all  the  Right-wing\r\n\r\nforces  of  the  Opposition in  spite  of  repeated\r\n\r\ndenials. The Opposition has not dared to come out in\r\n\r\nthe  open, but unfortunately the Member for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan has rather indiscreetly let the cat out of\r\n\r\nthe bag by singing his praises of Ong Eng Guan. Does\r\n\r\nthe Opposition think that the secret help to Ong Eng\r\n\r\nGuan will enable the Right-wing forces to rise again\r\n\r\nfrom  the  ashes? At this point, may  I  answer  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill? Unfortunately he is not  here\r\n\r\nnow. He asked a very simple question. He asked: What\r\n\r\nis  the  Right-wing? Well, let me tell  him,  though\r\n\r\neverybody  knows  he  is no political  chicken.  The\r\n\r\ndifference was very patent in the mass rally held at\r\n\r\nthe  Happy World Stadium last Sunday. He did mention\r\n\r\nthat.  While 15,000 Left-wingers attended  the  mass\r\n\r\nrally  to show their disgust and abhorrence  at  the\r\n\r\nmurder  of  Patrice  Lumumba, all the  Right-wingers\r\n\r\nstayed   away.  Did  we  see  the  moral  rearmament\r\n\r\nsupporters  or  the  Lim Yew  Hocks?  When  all  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Left-wingers showed their determination-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

Did  they  show\r\n\r\nthey  were ready to fight on a united front for  the\r\n\r\nfreedom of Singapore? That, Sir, is my answer to the\r\n\r\ndifference between the Right-wingers and  the \r\n\r\nLeft-wingers.   It   is  the  difference   between   \r\n\r\npro-colonialists  and  anti-colonialists.  It   is   the\r\n\r\ndifference  between the opportunists  and  political\r\n\r\nadventurers and genuine patriots who truly work  for\r\n\r\nthe  advancement and welfare of the people.  I  also\r\n\r\nremember,  Sir,  that  in  one  of  the  mass  rally\r\n\r\nspeeches  made  in  the  Happy  World  Stadium  last\r\n\r\nSunday,  the names of Mobutu, Kasavubu, Tshombe  and\r\n\r\nLim  Yew Hock were all linked together. I cannot see\r\n\r\nwhat  sort  of  blood relationship  they  have.  But\r\n\r\nwhatever  it  is, we certainly do not want  Tshombes\r\n\r\nand  such persons in our Malaya. I would not  go  so\r\n\r\nfar  as to say that Ong Eng Guan is also linked with\r\n\r\nTshombe.  But from the performance of the Opposition\r\n\r\ntoday,  who is to know what part the Lim  Yew  Hocks\r\n\r\nplay in this linkage of adventurism, opportunism and\r\n\r\nreaction?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, although this may appear to be a slight digression, it has all been mentioned in\r\n\r\nanswer  to  what  Members  of  the  Opposition  have\r\n\r\nraised.  The  whole world knows how opportunism  and\r\n\r\nreaction   are  very  intimately  linked   up   with\r\n\r\nmachinations    and   out-pourings   of    malicious\r\n\r\nfalsehoods to injure people.

Really,  Sir, we can  say  now  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Hong Lim and all the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill know that an opportunist and a proven liar will\r\n\r\nmake yet another attempt to deceive the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, today in this Assembly we have spent a\r\n\r\nlot of time debating the Report of the Commission of\r\n\r\nInquiry into the allegations made by Ong Eng Guan. I\r\n\r\nwant   to   make  two  points  here.  Firstly,   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of  justice and  the  dignity  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly. Secondly, I want to stress that the \r\n\r\nRight-wing group has allied itself with Mr Ong Eng Guan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the first point. In\r\n\r\nSouth-east   Asia  today  many  countries  are  practising\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy. Our State is one  of  them.\r\n\r\nWhether  this system can succeed or not  depends  on\r\n\r\nhow  responsible  people  practise  this  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem.  What I want to stress is that  we  want  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  this system. And the main purpose  of  the\r\n\r\nInquiry Commission is to disclose the facts  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  enable  them to understand  clearly  our\r\n\r\nattitude,  our  speeches and  our  actions  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly. Unfortunately, many Opposition Members are\r\n\r\nafraid  of  this  Inquiry  Commission.  Why?  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are  afraid that the  facts  will  be\r\n\r\ndisclosed  so that the people will know  the  truth.\r\n\r\nAnd  they  are  also  afraid and worried  about  the\r\n\r\nappointment of this Inquiry Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe my colleagues just now have clearly made\r\n\r\nmany  points  relating  to the  privileges  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  Let  us  all  hope that  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance  will  be\r\n\r\nused  for  the  last time, and that in future  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  no  such incident. Let us  all  hope  that\r\n\r\neverybody here will maintain the decorum and dignity\r\n\r\nof this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now come back to those two persons who have\r\n\r\nleft  our  Party and are now sitting on the opposite\r\n\r\nbenches. They had in the past shouted very clean and\r\n\r\nhealthy  slogans and expressed their views  to  good\r\n\r\neffect. Let me remind them that they must not forget\r\n\r\nwhat  they had professed in the past. They must  now\r\n\r\nrenew their stand. During the course of the speeches\r\n\r\nof the Opposition Members, though they have declared\r\n\r\nthat they have no link with Mr Ong Eng Guan, yet it\r\n\r\ncannot be denied that they have \"sub-links\" with Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng Guan. Since the Ong Eng Guan incident, they\r\n\r\nhave  been supporting him. Now is a good chance  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  make a political fortune. Ong  Eng  Guan's\r\n\r\nincident is something like a life-boat for  them  to\r\n\r\nsail  in,  so that they can prolong their  political\r\n\r\nlife.  But they will find later that this life-boat,\r\n\r\nwhen  caught in a great storm, will not  bring  them\r\n\r\nback  to their political dreamland, but will capsize\r\n\r\nin the storm and bring them destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the hon. Member for Cairnhill has made\r\n\r\nmany allegations. He had quoted at length in support\r\n\r\nof Mr Ong Eng Guan. If he is not connected with Ong\r\n\r\nEng  Guan, why should he make such lengthy  speeches\r\n\r\nin  support  of him? This attitude of  his  and  his\r\n\r\nspeech  clearly show that he has been  contradicting\r\n\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me mention this fact. Not long ago in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly,  our Leader of  the  House  moved  a\r\n\r\nmotion  relating to the dignity and decorum of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  At that time, the Opposition Member,  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng Guan, also supported this motion. But then,\r\n\r\nwhen  Mr  Ong Eng Guan had made certain allegations\r\n\r\nto  the  detriment  of the people  both  inside  and\r\n\r\noutside  this Assembly, the other Opposition Members\r\n\r\ndid not come forward to support the motion. They now\r\n\r\nonly  want to renew their old dream. All this  shows\r\n\r\nthat Mr Ong Eng Guan and those Right-wing political\r\n\r\nelements  are  united. They are connected  and  they\r\n\r\nform a united front. It seems that they still have a\r\n\r\nchance  to  renew their old daydream. But after  the\r\n\r\nelection,  they  will  have a very  good  chance  to\r\n\r\nreply. Of course, this reply will depend on the wise\r\n\r\njudgment of the people in Hong Lim, so that this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill   lead   them  to  see  the  present  political\r\n\r\nsituation  in Singapore. This result will also  show\r\n\r\nthe political standard of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nI  wholeheartedly support the motion  moved  by  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister. From the basis of the Inquiry\r\n\r\nReport, which has been tabled in the Assembly today,\r\n\r\nit  is  clear  that Mr Ong Eng Guan  had  used  the\r\n\r\nprivilege  of  this  Assembly  to  spread  malicious\r\n\r\nfalsehoods  and to injure persons both  outside  and\r\n\r\ninside  this  Assembly who have  no  opportunity  to\r\n\r\ndefend themselves. What a shame it is for a man  who\r\n\r\nclaims  to represent the people, but who, in  actual\r\n\r\nfact,  in  using  the  freedom  of  speech  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, has made false allegations instead. It  is\r\n\r\nthe  principle of any government which  believes  in\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy that there is  no  absolute\r\n\r\nfreedom  of speech. But freedom of speech is freedom\r\n\r\nof speech to tell the truth. He must not just say it\r\n\r\nin   the  Assembly,  but  he  must  be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate it outside the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on this issue, many speakers from the Opposition have indirectly opposed the motion moved\r\n\r\nby  the Deputy Prime Minister. They say that whether\r\n\r\nMr  Ong Eng Guan has told a lie or otherwise,  this\r\n\r\nmotion  is to expedite the by-election at Hong  Lim.\r\n\r\nBut  they have forgotten that the coming by-election\r\n\r\nat  Hong  Lim is the result of a vacancy created  by\r\n\r\nOng Eng Guan himself. In fact, the vacancy is \r\n\r\ninter-related with the allegations of nepotism made by Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Eng  Guan against Ministers. Mr Speaker,  with\r\n\r\nthe  Report before us, those Opposition Members have\r\n\r\nstarted to fraternise with Mr Ong Eng Guan whom  we\r\n\r\nknow  today  as a political adventurer, and  who  is\r\n\r\nprepared to do anything to achieve his own political\r\n\r\nends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I feel strange towards the two Members, the Member for Aljunied and his colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Punggol, who have vehemently opposed\r\n\r\nthe Report of the Commission of Inquiry. However,  I\r\n\r\nam of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopinion  that  when the Commission was  sitting  and\r\n\r\ncalling   for   witnesses   to   substantiate    the\r\n\r\nallegations  made by their colleague, none  of  them\r\n\r\nhad  the  guts to come forward to give  evidence  in\r\n\r\ndefence of their colleague in the Commission. If  it\r\n\r\nwere  me,  Mr  Speaker, in the name of  the  Party,\r\n\r\nsubsequently I would resign my seat in the  Assembly\r\n\r\nto which I was elected under that Party ticket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in conclusion, I was very much impressed by the speech made by the Member for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan.  His speech  was  fiery  perhaps\r\n\r\nbecause of the fasting month. But what tickles me is\r\n\r\nthis, when I remember the incident of children  when\r\n\r\nthey  argue among themselves. They spit or  mock  at\r\n\r\none   another  and  they  will  flee,  leaving   the\r\n\r\narguments  alone, not wishing to have  a  sight  any\r\n\r\nmore of their enemies. I feel, Mr Speaker, what has\r\n\r\nbeen brought home by the Minister for Culture on the\r\n\r\nGovernment's attitude of not caring as to which side\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition is going to vote is clear  to  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  following  the political  developments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the vacancy created by the\r\n\r\nresignation of Mr Ong Eng Guan, there are political\r\n\r\nparties,  in this Assembly and outside the Assembly,\r\n\r\nwhich have fraternised and have flirted with Mr Ong\r\n\r\nEng  Guan.  Those political parties are hoping  that\r\n\r\nthey are not concerned with who will win, so long as\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is  defeated  in  the  forthcoming  \r\n\r\nby-election at Hong Lim. Although Ong Eng Guan has been\r\n\r\nregarded  as  a liar by the Commission  of  Inquiry,\r\n\r\ntheir aim is merely to support Ong Eng Guan in order\r\n\r\nto defeat the P.A.P. in the by-election. It is clear\r\n\r\nby  this that these political parties have made  Ong\r\n\r\nEng  Guan their tool in order to oppose the People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party.  Whether or not they themselves  have\r\n\r\nanything in common with Ong Eng Guan is immaterial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this issue, since the Ong Eng Guan incident,\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. has not yet started to flirt with  Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan.  From  the  action of the Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan, it may not be U.M.N.O. but it may be that\r\n\r\nthe Member for Kampong Kembangan himself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  flirted  with Ong Eng Guan. Mr  Speaker,  when\r\n\r\nmentioning this issue, I am impressed when  I  think\r\n\r\nof  how  Ong Eng Guan dreamed of becoming the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. Likewise, the Member for Kampong Kembangan\r\n\r\nhas an axe to grind with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Member for Kampong Kembangan himself\r\n\r\ndid  say that at one time I did become his political\r\n\r\ntutor.  Concerning the clashes that nearly  happened\r\n\r\nbetween  the Chinese and the Malays, the Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong Kembangan has taken the opportunity in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly to say that I approached U.M.N.O. and asked\r\n\r\nfor  their co-operation. Mr Speaker, this  is  true\r\n\r\nbecause  rumours  which  will  precipitate  communal\r\n\r\nclashes in this country will merely reflect  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and it is the responsibility of all  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  love  peace  to dispel  those  rumours.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I invited U.M.N.O. and asked them if they\r\n\r\nwould  like to co-operate to wipe out these rumours.\r\n\r\nMy  invitation  was  welcomed by U.M.N.O.  For  that\r\n\r\nreason,  the Minister for Culture in his  speech  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  on  the movement of  A.R.T.I.S. did\r\n\r\nmention  the leaders of U.M.N.O. as well  as  Muslim\r\n\r\nreligious   leaders   who   co-operated   with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. It is our common responsibility  towards\r\n\r\nthe  prosperity  and well-being  of  the  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Also, Mr Speaker, I would like to stress\r\n\r\nin  this Assembly the reason why we invited U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nto  take  part  with us to wipe out  these  rumours,\r\n\r\nbecause  many  factions from those  responsible  for\r\n\r\nspreading   the  malicious  rumours  did   implicate\r\n\r\nseveral  leaders who were involved in this movement.\r\n\r\nTherefore-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Hon. the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  has gone far enough to answer  the  point\r\n\r\nmade  by the Member for Kampong Kembangan. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  point  made by the Member for Kampong Kembangan\r\n\r\nwas   quite   irrelevant,  and   I   permitted   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to speak until now in answer\r\n\r\nto  the point made. I do not think he should go into\r\n\r\nfurther details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Yaacob: Mr Speaker, I merely explained just\r\n\r\nnow in answer to the Member for Kampong Kembangan. I\r\n\r\ntalked  about the false rumours because there  is  a\r\n\r\nfeeling  that the Government has forgotten the  good\r\n\r\nco-operation  rendered by U.M.N.O. Mr Speaker,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampong Kembangan has clearly said  that\r\n\r\nOng  Eng  Guan was instrumental in breaking  up  the\r\n\r\nunity  of U.M.N.O. in Singapore. Whether it is  true\r\n\r\nor  otherwise, it is left to the Member for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan.  But when he mentioned that a  number  of\r\n\r\npersons  who  are  now on the Government  side  were\r\n\r\nformer members of U.M.N.O., I would like to say that\r\n\r\nwe  who  left  U.M.N.O. to join the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty  did  so  not  because of Ong  Eng  Guan,  but\r\n\r\nbecause of the P.A.P.'s social, democratic ideology.\r\n\r\nA  great number of the members who left U.M.N.O. and\r\n\r\njoined  the  People's  Action  Party  at  one   time\r\n\r\ncomprised   Left-wing   elements.   They   conducted\r\n\r\npolitical  activities in the Federation  which  were\r\n\r\nlater banned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must now stop the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  from continuing in that  strain.  Now,\r\n\r\nwill he come back to the motion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I merely\r\n\r\nsaid  that  just  now  so  that  there  will  be  no\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding in this Assembly.  It  is  possible\r\n\r\nthat  trying to implicate Members of the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  confuse matters, but I would like to say  that\r\n\r\nthe  groups  which opposed the motion moved  by  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister in this Assembly clearly state\r\n\r\ntheir stand, that they have some sinister motive  or\r\n\r\nthat they have begun to flirt with Ong Eng Guan. For\r\n\r\nthat reason, they have not got the guts to come  out\r\n\r\nopenly. If outside of the Assembly they were to  say\r\n\r\nthat   the  People's  Action  Party  is  no   longer\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of  the  people,  then  they  should\r\n\r\ncontest the by-election to fight the P.A.P. But what\r\n\r\ndo we find, Mr Speaker? In an indirect manner, they\r\n\r\nare  supporting  Ong Eng Guan and  using  him  as  a\r\n\r\nshield  and  a  tool to defeat the  People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty   in   the  by-election.  This   is   a   very\r\n\r\ndishonourable act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid my Malay is not so\r\n\r\ngood. But the translation is that there has been  an\r\n\r\nallegation that Members of the Opposition are guilty\r\n\r\nof  a  dishonourable  act. If  that  translation  is\r\n\r\ncorrect,  I think the Member ought to withdraw  that\r\n\r\nallegation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am\r\n\r\nprepared to withdraw it. But what I meant to say was\r\n\r\nthat the method of opposing in an indirect manner in\r\n\r\npolitics is unwise, because we must come out in  the\r\n\r\nopen.   If  the  present  Government  is  no  longer\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the people, then the  Party  which\r\n\r\ncould  claim  to  represent the people  should  come\r\n\r\nforward  and  put up their candidates  so  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  could pass judgment as to which Party really\r\n\r\nrepresents the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Shall we adjourn?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That this debate be now adjourned.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, this is the Puasa month and\r\n\r\nMalay  Members have to go to mosque at 6.50 p.m. to\r\n\r\nbreak their fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this debate be now adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Resumption of debate, what day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now\r\n\r\nadjourn.\"-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">six minutes past Six o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
