M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the view of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  that the present  structure  of  the\r\n\r\nlegal  aid  system in Singapore is not suitable  for\r\n\r\nextension to criminal cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal aid system in England as administered by\r\n\r\nthe Law Society is not concerned with criminal legal\r\n\r\naid. The system of criminal legal aid in England  is\r\n\r\nadministered  through  the  Courts  themselves.  The\r\n\r\nChairman  of Quarter Sessions himself considers  all\r\n\r\napplications for legal aid in his court  and  grants\r\n\r\nor  rejects  applications in  his  sole  discretion.\r\n\r\nLikewise do the Magistrates. So also does the  Judge\r\n\r\nor Commissioner in the Old Bailey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a legal aid scheme for criminal cases is\r\n\r\nintroduced,  it  must,  if  it  is  to   be   fairly\r\n\r\nadministered, apply to all cases whether before  the\r\n\r\nHigh Court or before the subordinate Courts. This is\r\n\r\nthe  practice  in  England.  There  is  already   in\r\n\r\nexistence  a scheme whereby lawyers are assigned  to\r\n\r\naccused  persons charged with capital offences.  All\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the Legal Aid and  Advice  Ordinance\r\n\r\nenvisage recourse to the English system. This  would\r\n\r\nmean  the  Courts administering criminal legal  aid,\r\n\r\nconsidering all such applications and assigning  all\r\n\r\ncases  which they think should be granted legal  aid\r\n\r\nto members of the profession. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofession therefore would have to play an even more\r\n\r\nactive  role  in participating in such a  legal  aid\r\n\r\nscheme  if  legal aid is to be extended to  criminal\r\n\r\ncases.  Such  an extension of the legal  aid  system\r\n\r\nmust  apply to all criminal cases, not only the High\r\n\r\nCourt cases, and the members of the profession  must\r\n\r\nbe  prepared  to participate on the  basis  that  no\r\n\r\nassigned  brief can be refused at the  rates  to  be\r\n\r\nprescribed even though members of the profession can\r\n\r\ncommand higher fees on other work in respect of  the\r\n\r\ntime employed on such assigned cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would prefer legal aid to be given\r\n\r\nin  criminal  cases by the Bench with the  full  co-operation  of  the  Bar as it  is  the  practice  in\r\n\r\nEngland,  rather than legal aid to  be  provided  by\r\n\r\nlawyers in full-time Government employment. It  does\r\n\r\nseem  odd  that the State should prosecute offenders\r\n\r\nand,  at  the same time, engage lawyers in full-time\r\n\r\nemployment to defend these offenders. I know this is\r\n\r\nthe practice in certain States in Australia, but  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  used to the practice here  of  assigning\r\n\r\ncounsel for the defence in capital charges, and this\r\n\r\nsystem  could very well be extended by adopting  the\r\n\r\nEnglish practice in regard to the grant of legal aid\r\n\r\nin criminal cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One great advantage of the English system of legal\r\n\r\naid  in  criminal cases, which is completely outside\r\n\r\nthe  English legal aid service operated by  the  Law\r\n\r\nSociety  in  civil cases, is that it is operated  by\r\n\r\nthe Judiciary and the Bar. Judges can be depended on\r\n\r\nto  look  fairly into the legal points  of  criminal\r\n\r\ncases  which are before them for trial  and  can  be\r\n\r\ndepended on to reject applications for legal aid  in\r\n\r\ncriminal  cases where no points of legal  difficulty\r\n\r\nare  likely to arise. It is not the intention of the\r\n\r\nscheme of legal aid in criminal cases in England  or\r\n\r\nhere  to  grant legal aid to all and sundry  but  to\r\n\r\ngrant it in criminal cases involving fine points  of\r\n\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to estimate accurately the cost\r\n\r\nof  extending  the legal aid scheme to all  criminal\r\n\r\nmatters  before  the  High  Court.  There  were  152\r\n\r\ncriminal cases tried in the High Court in 1961\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand 1962, and if the costs per case are estimated at\r\n\r\n$1,000,  the  cost to Government of extending  legal\r\n\r\naid to all criminal cases in the High Court will  be\r\n\r\naround $76,000 a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the administration of justice will be a Federal\r\n\r\nmatter, estimates for such a scheme will have to  be\r\n\r\napproved   by  the  Central  Government,   and   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government is in no position to accept any\r\n\r\nsuch commitment on its own responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Is the Minister aware that\r\n\r\nthe  Bar  Committee fully support the suggestion  of\r\n\r\nthe  extension  of free legal aid  to  all  criminal\r\n\r\ncases  in  the High Court, whether the appellate  or\r\n\r\noriginal  jurisdiction? If he is, would he  consider\r\n\r\nnegotiating  with  them with a view  to  evolving  a\r\n\r\nscheme satisfactory to that end?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have already\r\n\r\nexplained,  the  administration  of  justice  is   a\r\n\r\nFederal  responsibility. We cannot as  a  Government\r\n\r\nenter    into   any   commitments   on    our    own\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Bar Committee had been really keen on the\r\n\r\nextension of legal aid to criminal cases, they would\r\n\r\nhave  taken  steps  to see that such  a  system  was\r\n\r\nintroduced.  But so far, they have only  voiced  the\r\n\r\nopinion  that the legal aid system is acceptable  to\r\n\r\nthem.  But  they have done nothing to further  their\r\n\r\ndemand for the extension of legal aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Does the Minister not\r\n\r\nconsider that the provision of legal and is a social\r\n\r\namenity  and not in the course of the administration\r\n\r\nof justice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You have to run the legal aid system in\r\n\r\na  proper way.

I am sure he is conscious  that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, where the vast majority of our population\r\n\r\ndo  not speak the language of the administration  of\r\n\r\njustice,  it  is  particularly important  that  they\r\n\r\nshould have legal assistance not merely where points\r\n\r\nof  law  arise  but for the proper  presentation  of\r\n\r\ntheir  cases.

Although  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  grant  was  $1.4 million  short  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity's expectation, it is reliably  understood\r\n\r\nthat despite an increased enrolment of 2,149 instead\r\n\r\nof  2,120 as estimated by the University, there will\r\n\r\nstill be a surplus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WORK BRIGADE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Setting up of Commission)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational   Development  whether  he  will   consider\r\n\r\nsetting   up  a  Commission  to  inquire  into   the\r\n\r\nfunctioning  of  the  Work  Brigade  and   to   make\r\n\r\nrecommendation for its future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, the Work Brigade was set up\r\n\r\nin March 1960 with the following objects:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to keep in useful and gainful occupation\r\n\r\nyouths  between  the ages of 16  and  30  who  would\r\n\r\notherwise he swelling the ranks of the unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to place them in permanent employment in\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  other organisations  in  the  State\r\n\r\nafter  a  period of training designed to  turn  them\r\n\r\ninto useful citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the years since March 1960, thousands of\r\n\r\nyouths   have  been  kept  in  useful  and   gainful\r\n\r\noccupation   and  over  2,000  youths   have   found\r\n\r\nemployment through the Work Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Work Brigade has been\r\n\r\nfunctioning satisfactorily and I see no  reason  for\r\n\r\nsetting   up  a  Commission  to  inquire  into   the\r\n\r\nfunctioning of the Work Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he is\r\n\r\nnot  aware  that it is generally believed  that  the\r\n\r\nWork   Brigade   is   being   used   for   political\r\n\r\ndemonstrations  and some of the  members  are  being\r\n\r\ncoerced thereto and paid public monies therefor?

In point of fact, as I said  yesterday,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Cairnhill did practise this  tactic\r\n\r\nfor his own benefit, and now he is throwing the same\r\n\r\ncharges  at others. I know how efficient the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill is in protecting himself or in saving\r\n\r\nhimself from extinction. In the first election  when\r\n\r\nhe  contested the Keppel Ward, he stood in the  name\r\n\r\nof  the  Labour Party. In 1955 he contested  in  the\r\n\r\nname  of the Labour Front, and in 1959 again on  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. ticket, and maybe the next year in the  name\r\n\r\nof  the  Alliance. He reminds me of  the  proverbial\r\n\r\nhermit-crab, whose anterior is similar to that of  a\r\n\r\ncrab  but  whose posterior is that of a  snail.  The\r\n\r\nbody  of  this hermit-crab is weak.

But the Member for Cairnhill is\r\n\r\nso  scared  to  face the people that in  his  speech\r\n\r\nyesterday he said that the 15 elected Members should\r\n\r\nbe  nominated  from  among  the  51  Assemblymen  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This is clear proof that he wants to save\r\n\r\nhimself.  The 15 representatives must be elected  by\r\n\r\nthe  people.

The real motive behind the Member for Cairnhill's opposition to this Bill is I his, and it is a coincidence that this appeared in today's Utusan Melayu in an article headed \"Federal House of Representatives Elections\". It says that the UMNO-MCA-MIC will each get four\r\n\r\nseats,  and  the  balance will  be  for  the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nBecause the S.P.A. get a less number of seats,  they\r\n\r\nhave  shown opposition and they are not prepared  to\r\n\r\ncontest  the  elections.

We\r\n\r\nare  going to face the people now. Because Singapore\r\n\r\nheld its first referendum, she was able to solve the\r\n\r\nmerger problem. Now where is her self-respect if  we\r\n\r\ncannot  send elected representatives to the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament?

So why does the P.A.P. not abolish\r\n\r\nthis  Legislature and, at the same time,  appoint  a\r\n\r\nJapanese  type of judiciary so that tyranny  can  be\r\n\r\nmore complete?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Yes,\r\n\r\nwe will appoint you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in that case\r\n\r\nthe  first person I will fix up is the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is not that the P.A.P. Government lacks\r\n\r\nthe  intent  or the will hut the powers  behind  the\r\n\r\nscenes could see the catastrophe if the present cat-and-mouse  type of democracy is further  allowed  to\r\n\r\ndeteriorate. As I myself see it, the Bill has  three\r\n\r\npurposes.  Its  primary purpose is to avoid  Federal\r\n\r\nelections  for Singapore's 15 representatives  being\r\n\r\nconducted  not under the more independent Federation\r\n\r\nElections  Commission but under P.A.P. control.  We\r\n\r\ncan  expect  and envisage what the course  of  these\r\n\r\nelections  would  be  like, particularly  after  our\r\n\r\nexperience in the National Referendum campaign.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. hopes that by rigging the elections  it  can\r\n\r\nwin  a  few seats, and if these elections  could  be\r\n\r\nheld  before 31st August they would then still  have\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  the  Police  machinery  - the  Special\r\n\r\nBranch  and the C.I.D. - which would be useful weapons\r\n\r\nin  rigging  the elections. Further, with  all  this\r\n\r\nparaphernalia of State control, the P.A.P. can  hope\r\n\r\nto  win a few seats which will provide a prop in the\r\n\r\ncoming State elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, months ago in our Party paper we have already analysed what these elections would be like. We have already foreseen that there would be elections before 31st August if the P.A.P. Government had its way. We have already foreseen as far hack as May this year that there would be an\r\n\r\nundemocratic  delineation of boundaries.  I  already\r\n\r\nhave a draft list of what the P.A.P. proposes to  do\r\n\r\nwith the boundaries. As stated in our Party organ,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have  already foreseen that one of the  purposes\r\n\r\nwas to seek safe seats for the P.A.P. Ministers. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the Minister for Health and Law  will\r\n\r\nnot  have a safe seat at all because he is now  not\r\n\r\nin the good hooks of the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the P.A.P. can win a few seats, then we can expect the coming State elections to be held very soon; it might be after a few weeks.\r\n\r\nBut  if the P.A.P. faces complete calamity, then  we\r\n\r\ncan  expect the P.A.P. Prime Minister running  again\r\n\r\nafter  the  British and asking them to provide  more\r\n\r\ntime  so that he can find further ways and means  to\r\n\r\nsave the P.A.P. from complete disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second purpose of this Bill is to provide for special counting - and this we foresaw long ago - so that the results of the 51 State constituencies, although regrouped into 15 for Federal constituencies, could be known only to the P.A.P. Mr Speaker, this is the way it will be done.\r\n\r\nSuppose Geylang West, Geylang East, Mountbatten  and\r\n\r\nJoo   Chiat   were   regrouped  into   one   Federal\r\n\r\nconstituency;  during the counting  there  would  be\r\n\r\nfour  tables  and the tour Presiding Officers  would\r\n\r\nknow  the  actual number of P.A.P. votes  for  each\r\n\r\nState  division. But the Opposition  candidates  and\r\n\r\ntheir  counting  agents could only  know  the  total\r\n\r\nnumber  of  votes cast for each of the  Parties.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  the P.A.P. would have the  additional\r\n\r\nadvantage of knowing their exact strength in each of\r\n\r\nthe  51 State constituencies. Let us assume that out\r\n\r\nof  the  51 constituencies, the P.A.P. can  pick  up\r\n\r\nfive  or  six. Kreta Ayer is supposed  to  be  their\r\n\r\nstrongest  constituency. They want to  know  exactly\r\n\r\nhow  the people there vote. Tanjong Pagar, they want\r\n\r\nto  know how the people there vote. Anson, with  the\r\n\r\nWork Brigade, they want to know how the people there\r\n\r\nvote.  Now,  these five or six safe seats  would  be\r\n\r\nallotted to the most trusted Ministers of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAnd as I have said just now, the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nand Law is not one of the trusted Ministers -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.

Ministers will hope,\r\n\r\ntherefore, by such an operation to pick out the safe\r\n\r\nseats,  if  any is left, and leave the P.A.P.  Back-benchers to swim on their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third purpose of this Bill, as I see it, is to\r\n\r\nsee  that  the Prime Minister himself is elected  to\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian Parliament. This - we knew it for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time yesterday - is for a period of six years.\r\n\r\nWe were given the impression that it would be for  a\r\n\r\nperiod of nine months. But it is for a period of six\r\n\r\nyears.  So  that  he, having failed to  deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore and us here, could be  able  to\r\n\r\nmanipulate  and play his political pranks  with  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament from the Sabah  territories,\r\n\r\nfrom  Sarawak and from the Federation, both  on  the\r\n\r\nOpposition and the Government benches. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, it is quite a wild venture, but if he gets  in,\r\n\r\nI  can  assure you that he can do a lot  of  pranks.\r\n\r\nSir,  everything is being done to see that the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is  one  of the 15 to go in.  Whether  any\r\n\r\nother P.A.P. Minister gets in or not, whether any of\r\n\r\nthe other 14 is P.A.P. or non-P.A.P. actually is not\r\n\r\nso  important as the Prime Minister himself  getting\r\n\r\nin.  Because if the Prime Minister can get into  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Parliament, he will be able to  convince\r\n\r\nDonald  Stephens  and then the Sarawak  delegation's\r\n\r\nall  totalling  40 votes; he will  try  to  get  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  benches  in  the Federation  Parliament,\r\n\r\nbecause,  Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody in the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nParliament  can  beat, as we must  acknowledge,  his\r\n\r\npowers  of  oratory. Those who admire  him  say  his\r\n\r\npowers  of oratory; those who do not admire him  say\r\n\r\nhis powers to twist and turn. But he will be able to\r\n\r\nconvince  the  Sabah M.P.s. the Sarawak  M.P.s.  the\r\n\r\nOpposition   M.P.s  and  even  the   Alliance   Back\r\n\r\nbenchers.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Federal  Parliament\r\n\r\nwill  be  like  a  cauldron  where  water  would  be\r\n\r\nboiling.  Everything is now being done in  Singapore\r\n\r\nto see that our great Prime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  goes  into the Malaysian Parliament.  Last\r\n\r\nweek,  a $2 million so-called Malaysian bonus - it  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  Malaysian bonus, it is the Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nFederation  M.P. bonus at our expense - was  given  to\r\n\r\nthe  workers  and  they have been waiting  for  four\r\n\r\nyears.  Why not give to them earlier? They were  all\r\n\r\npart  of  the P.A.P.'s election promises to  give  a\r\n\r\nbetter  way  of life to the workers,  not  only  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board workers, but all the workers\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, all the poor people of Singapore. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, months ago we forecast this  move  to\r\n\r\nincrease the pay of the Harbour Board workers, it is\r\n\r\nin  our Party organ. There is no genuine concern for\r\n\r\nthe  workers.  Incidentally, since I  am  discussing\r\n\r\nthis Bill, I would like to ask the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nhow  many  Work Brigade members are in the electoral\r\n\r\nregisters  of Anson and Tanjong Pagar. Personally  I\r\n\r\ndo not think all the Work Brigade members will vote \r\n\r\nfor the Prime Minister for their $1.50 a day. But  I\r\n\r\njust  wish  to know how many of them are living  and \r\n\r\nhave their names in the electoral registers of Anson\r\n\r\nand  Tanjong Pagar-[Interruption]. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson is not on the electoral register of Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill, as I see it, envisages the\r\n\r\nfollowing undemocratic features for the purpose of \r\n\r\nthe  Federal  elections. First,  delineation  of \r\n\r\nboundaries to be undemocratic. The whole  setup \r\n\r\nwas ready months ago. The delineation of boundaries,\r\n\r\nas far  as  I know, was ready. The candidates were \r\n\r\nall ready.  Everyday  we  see  the  papers  boosting\r\n\r\nup candidates; Dr Fong Kim Heng with his programme for\r\n\r\nbringing rain from Australia down here -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Jek Yuen Thong, a\r\n\r\npossible candidate, the Parliamentary Secretary   to  the  Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\na   potential candidate. Everyday we see the papers boosting  them up. \r\n\r\nWe  know.  The  election machinery  was  ready. Everything was ready.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary o our Branch  in Tanjong Pagar was detained.\r\n\r\nThis is all part of  the operation.  We knew it long ago.\r\n\r\nWhy this  farce  of inviting the  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties to send four representatives  \r\n\r\nto delineate   boundaries  which  have   already \r\n\r\nbeen decided?  We  send four, the Government sends \r\n\r\nfive; first,  the  Government hopes that the four  \r\n\r\nin  the Opposition  will  give  four  different  views.\r\n\r\nOf course,  we  will. If we ask four brothers  to  give their\r\n\r\nviews on delineation, all four will come  out with  four different \r\n\r\nmethods of delineation. And  if in case we do not fight and we agre\r\n\r\ne among ourselves first  before  we  meet the P.A.P. representatives, \r\n\r\nthen,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, they  will  have  five  to outvote  us  four. \r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, what democracy? We   have  seen  previously  that  \r\n\r\nthere  were   two Commissions  on  the delineation of boundaries; \r\n\r\none was for the 32 -  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

A deadlock, what happens?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second undemocratic feature of the Bill is to provide for snap elections. We do not know when the elections for the 15 seats are coming. If the P.A.P. had its way, we expected polling day would be before 31st August, that is, when the P.A.P. still has control of the police, the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch, the C.I.D. and all  the  organs  of\r\n\r\nsuppression. We will also expect that there might be\r\n\r\na  second  sweep of political opponents whereby  the\r\n\r\nParties would be paralysed. The organisations  would\r\n\r\nhe paralysed for a few weeks because of the reign of\r\n\r\nterror  and fear imposed in Singapore and the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwill rush in with a snap election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. only need to give a minimum of nine days between nomination and polling days. And we know that at any time after the sweep it takes at least a minimum of one or two months for any Party to recover from the sweep. So, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must watch with interest the\r\n\r\nactivities in Cameron Highlands - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sapu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The third undemocratic feature is\r\n\r\nthat  this Bill provides for the P.A.P.

It is very difficult  for  us  to\r\n\r\ncanvass and this is what the P.A.P. has done to  us.\r\n\r\nBut we know their tricks.

But,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, so long as we are given two weeks\r\n\r\nwe can make the people of Singapore know what is our\r\n\r\nnew symbol. The P.A.P. thought that we would not  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to sacrifice at this late hour and  change\r\n\r\nour symbol and that we would rather take the risk on\r\n\r\nnomination day, when the P.A.P. appointed  Returning\r\n\r\nOfficer could refuse our candidates the use  of  our\r\n\r\nthree-ring symbol.

They knew it - they saw me  there - and so, Mr Speaker, Sir, they withdrew the Bill. I\r\n\r\nhope  today, seeing the same situation,  23-23,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Member for ion Chiat has promised to vote  with\r\n\r\nus,  the Government will see sense and withdraw  the\r\n\r\nBill, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nyesterday  at 6.22 in the evening, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs introduced the Bill, which is the same\r\n\r\nas  the  National Referendum Bill.  The  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nintroduced  a  Bill like this in a hurry,  with  the\r\n\r\nsame intention as they had when they introduced  the\r\n\r\nNational Referendum Bill sometime ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Minister for Home Affairs moved the Second Reading of the Bill, he said at the very beginning that according to Annexure A, section 95 of the Malaysia Agreement, the relevant Bill will be presented to the Legislative Assembly. Mr Speaker, this is the first\r\n\r\ntime  the P.A.P. has introduced such a Bill  without\r\n\r\nletting  the  House know about the contents  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia Agreement. And they want the House to  pass\r\n\r\nthis Bill in a dictatorial and undemocratic way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, last year after debating the White Paper on Merger, the Government introduced the National Referendum Bill. But today, the Singapore (Elections to the Federal House of Representatives) Bill has been introduced by the Government in this House without allowing the House a debate on the Malaysia Agreement. According to the Order Paper,\r\n\r\nthe item on the Malaysia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgreement will be debated next Monday. This attitude\r\n\r\nof  the  Government  is more undemocratic  and  more\r\n\r\ndictatorial   than  that  shown  to   the   National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this House cannot be made a kind of blank cheque by the P.A.P. which would authorise them to fill in the amount of money on the cheque. Before we make out a blank cheque, we should know in advance the purpose of the cheque, that is, whether it is correct or whether it is for the right use.\r\n\r\nEven up till today we do not know the purpose of the\r\n\r\ncheque.  The Malaysia Bill is still in the  despatch\r\n\r\nbag  of the Prime Minister. Members on this side  of\r\n\r\nthe  House are still in the dark about the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement  and the Malaysia Bill. Yet the Government\r\n\r\nis asking the House to pass the Singapore (Elections\r\n\r\nto the Federal House of Representatives) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we cannot and must not be made use of by the P.A.P. for their personal interests. Mr Speaker, the Government has introduced this Bill in this way. There is a saying - counting your chickens before they are hatched. In the same way, the Government is making use of this House to pass a Bill to hold an election of 15 representatives to\r\n\r\nthe   Central   Parliament.  This   Bill   is   very\r\n\r\nundemocratic.  We should understand the  reason  why\r\n\r\nthe   Government  introduce  a  Bill  that  is  more\r\n\r\nundemocratic  than  the  National  Referendum  Bill.\r\n\r\nTheir  motive is to preserve their future  political\r\n\r\nlife  so  that they could have seats in the  Federal\r\n\r\nHouse of Representatives, and hey have therefore put\r\n\r\naside anything that is democratic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that the P.A.P. is thinking of sending their representatives to the House of Representatives. The Deputy Prime Minister has pointed out to the House that the Singapore representatives elected under this Bill will stay in Parliament for six years. From what the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and  the  Minister for Home  Affairs  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  we  can  see  the  purpose  of  their  urgent\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  this Bill. We  can  also  see  the\r\n\r\nmotive behind it - that the P.A.P. Ministers are very\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  their  places  in  the  House   of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was about three weeks ago when the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs, who is also the Organising  Secretary\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P., held a meeting of the  Bukit  Timah\r\n\r\nBranch  of  the P.A.P. He said that in the elections\r\n\r\nto  the Federal Parliament, the P.A.P. would be able\r\n\r\nto  gain 13 seats; the other two seats would perhaps\r\n\r\nbe  gained  by  U.M.N.O. He therefore  urged  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers  to find out their positive chances  in  the\r\n\r\nelections.  He  also  told  the  cadres   that   the\r\n\r\nelections  would begin in the middle of  August  and\r\n\r\npolling  day would be around the end of  August.  We\r\n\r\ncan  also see that the P.A.P. is making full use  of\r\n\r\nthe  Work  Brigade, People's Association  and  Party\r\n\r\nmembers for election purposes. The Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  also  told the cadres that  if  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncould  get 13 seats in the elections to the  Federal\r\n\r\nHouse of Representatives, they would then be able to\r\n\r\ndo  propaganda  work in the Federal  Parliament.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way, they would be able to continue to control\r\n\r\nthe  State  Legislature and would also  be  able  to\r\n\r\ninfluence  the  Malay voters in the  Federation  and\r\n\r\nalso a certain number of Chinese voters. Thus, after\r\n\r\n15 years, the Prime Minister would be able to become\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister of Malaysia. Mr  Speaker,  all\r\n\r\nthis  was  said  three weeks ago by  the  Organising\r\n\r\nSecretary of the P.A.P. to Party cadres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what the Minister for Home Affairs said to the\r\n\r\ncadres,  we can see that the P.A.P. is quite certain\r\n\r\nof  getting  into the Federal Parliament.  But  this\r\n\r\nself-confidence  is not due to the  support  of  the\r\n\r\npeople behind them but to their introduction of this\r\n\r\nBill  which  enables them to play dirty  games  like\r\n\r\ncarrying out dishonest elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if this Bill gets through its Third Reading today, then tomorrow the Yang di-Pertuan Negara will be able to give his assent and so make this Bill a law. And on Monday when this House debates the Malaysia Agreement, which is expected to end on Thursday, as said by the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister yesterday, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  will\r\n\r\ngive  his  assent to the Malaysia Bill on  Saturday.\r\n\r\nAnd  a week later the Government can hold elections.\r\n\r\nThat is the motive behind this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the P.A.P. not dare to hold elections in a\r\n\r\nfair  and  honest  way but wants to  monopolise  the\r\n\r\nelections? Why does it want to hold a snap election?\r\n\r\nIt  is  because  it knows very well that  under  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper merger agreement, control of the Police,\r\n\r\nTelevision and Broadcasting and the Press will go to\r\n\r\nthe  Central Government after 31st August, 1963.  So\r\n\r\nif  these elections are held after 31st August  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  have the control of these departments  as\r\n\r\nthey  do  now,  in  which case they  will  not  have\r\n\r\ncontrol   of  the  Work  Brigade  or  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.  Also  after that  date  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment will be responsible only for its  day-to-day  administration. The P.A.P. know very well  that\r\n\r\nin  future  elections  if they  want  to  hold  mass\r\n\r\nrallies, State conferences, there will be nobody  to\r\n\r\nattend  them; they got a very good result  from  the\r\n\r\nNational  Referendum. That is why the Government  is\r\n\r\nnow  trying  to carry out full-scale television  and\r\n\r\nbroadcasting work. The Government's intention is  to\r\n\r\nmonopolise the Federal elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. knows that its prestige is diminishing with the people. Even the Prime Minister himself is not sure of the support of the people of his own constituency. The Hong Lim and Anson by-elections have proved that the P.A.P. is now going down the drain. The Sembawang by-election has been postponed for about one year now. This all the more\r\n\r\nshows that even in the coming Sembawang by-election,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. will suffer a heavy loss. That is why  a\r\n\r\nsnap  Federal election will be the best  chance  for\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  If  the  election is  held  fairly  and\r\n\r\ndemocratically, then the P.A.P. oligarchy will  meet\r\n\r\nwith a disastrous defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Hong Lim has said that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. intends to test their safe seats in  the  15\r\n\r\ndivisions  to see to which constituencies  they  can\r\n\r\nsend  their representatives. It is because no  other\r\n\r\npolitical Party will know the voting results in  the\r\n\r\n51  constituencies, but the Returning  Officer  will\r\n\r\nknow  the  results. In other words, the P.A.P. will\r\n\r\nknow. Mr Speaker, the calculation of the votes  for\r\n\r\nthis Federal election will enable the P.A.P. to know\r\n\r\nthe  reaction  of  the people. The  first  time  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. tested\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people's intention was on the 1st of September,\r\n\r\n1962, when the National Referendum was held, so that\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. could  know  their  strength  in   the\r\n\r\nrespective  constituencies. Since then,  after  this\r\n\r\none year of propaganda by the P.A.P., the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nnow trying to assess the opinions and the wishes  of\r\n\r\nthe  people to see whether their propaganda  in  the\r\n\r\npast  year  has  been  successful  and  whether  the\r\n\r\nreaction  of  the  people  is  favourable  to  them.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  under these circumstances, the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nintention  is  to assess their strength  in  the  51\r\n\r\nconstituencies. That is the intrigue of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbehind this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance which is sufficient for us to carry out our elections in the 15 Parliament constituencies. The only difference is that these 51 constituencies will be grouped into 15 constituencies and the Electoral Registers are the\r\n\r\nsame. There is no difficulty in this. However,  this\r\n\r\nBill  which has been introduced by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs  is contrary to the present  Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly Elections Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the business of elections is a national matter. It is not a party matter. However, the Government regards the election of these 15 representatives as its own party affair. Therefore, they have now introduced a Bill which is a departure from our present Singapore Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nElections Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 3 of this Bill provides that the Minister be given powers to make rules and regulations. These powers are just like powers given to an emperor and the order or edict of the Minister will become the law of the country. In the past, the first Schedule to the Elections Ordinance provides\r\n\r\nfor  23 forms. If this amending Bill is passed,  the\r\n\r\npresent  Elections Ordinance will give the  Minister\r\n\r\npower  to  change  or amend all  the  forms  in  the\r\n\r\nSchedule.  Does  it  mean  that  the  Minister,   in\r\n\r\nintroducing   these  amendments,  can  assure   that\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy can be smoothly carried  out\r\n\r\nand can be more effective so that the people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  have  more  confidence  in  our  parliamentary\r\n\r\nsystem? On the contrary, this Bill shows clearly  to\r\n\r\nthe  people that there is no democracy in Singapore.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, the 23 forms provide for Party symbols,\r\n\r\nthe  nomination  of candidates, the  appointment  of\r\n\r\nelection  agents and the counting of ballot  papers,\r\n\r\netc.  But  if  this  Ordinance  is  amended  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the Minister for Home Affairs will  have\r\n\r\nall  the  powers to alter all the procedures adopted\r\n\r\nin  the  past  for  election purposes.  Under  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, to whom will this be of advantage? Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it  is  to  the  P.A.P.  This  will  be   a\r\n\r\ndisadvantage to all the Opposition Parties  and  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. This has been carried on by the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. all  along. After passing these  amendments,\r\n\r\nthe procedures for elections used in the past can be\r\n\r\naltered  by the Minister. Under these circumstances,\r\n\r\nhow  can  other  Parties carry  out  their  election\r\n\r\ncampaigns? We know that the Government is ready with\r\n\r\nall  their candidates and election officers. At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  the  staff in the Elections  Department\r\n\r\nhave  already  started writing out  election  cards.\r\n\r\nThis  work  was speeded up two weeks ago  when  they\r\n\r\ncalled  in students to help in this job. The tabling\r\n\r\nof this Bill and the acts of the Government can only\r\n\r\nlead  us  to  this conclusion. After the passing  of\r\n\r\nthese amendments, the Opposition Parties will not be\r\n\r\nable to carry out their election campaigns within 10\r\n\r\nto 12 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the printing presses in Singapore dare not print our propaganda material because of the many restrictions imposed by the Minister for Home Affairs, particularly on the Barisan Sosialis. How can we then carry out our propaganda work within 10 to 12 days? We will not be able to carry out our\r\n\r\nelection campaign within this short period.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will not alter the First Schedule,  then\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition Parties will be able  to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir  work  according  to  the  provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nSchedule  and the law. But after these  changes  are\r\n\r\nmade,  we will not be able to follow past procedures\r\n\r\nin carrying out our election campaigns. We will have\r\n\r\nto wait for an announcement by the Minister for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs  before we can carry out our  election\r\n\r\ncampaigns.  He  will not announce  the  changes  and\r\n\r\namendments  to the forms in time. We have  seen  how\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore National Referendum Bill was  debated\r\n\r\none  day and made law the very next day, and  within\r\n\r\ntwo weeks polling was carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on the election of the future 15 seats\r\n\r\nto  the Federal House of Representatives, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwill  do the same thing; that is, they will announce\r\n\r\nthe  date of polling day immediately after the  Bill\r\n\r\nhas  been  passed. Thus the Opposition  Parties  are\r\n\r\nplaced  in  a very difficult position to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir  election  campaigns. On the other  hand,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are in control of all the media of publicity,\r\n\r\nlike television, the radio and Rediffusion. In fact,\r\n\r\nthey  have been carrying out their election campaign\r\n\r\nfor  the last few months. Under these circumstances,\r\n\r\nthey   think   they  will  be  able  to   elect   13\r\n\r\nrepresentatives and that U.M.N.O. will only get  two\r\n\r\nseats. This is their line of propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the passing of this Bill will be the death knell of parliamentary democracy in Singapore. The provisions of this Bill contain various undemocratic features. In Committee, we will point out and expose the Government's motive in introducing this Bill. If the Government really want\r\n\r\nto  carry out the election in an unfair way, then it\r\n\r\nis  the  P.A.P. who  want to destroy  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  and the Opposition Parties will  not  be\r\n\r\nheld responsible for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the 13 P.A.P. plutocrats will be elected to\r\n\r\nthe  Federal  House of Representatives is  merely  a\r\n\r\ndaydream, like a soap bubble which will burst  in  a\r\n\r\nfew minutes. Their dream is only a fancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are\r\n\r\nobjectionable  features to this Bill. The  principal\r\n\r\none   is  the  traditional  loophole  whereby   this\r\n\r\nGovernment  gives itself the power to fix  the  date\r\n\r\nfor  the  election at such time as pleases itself.\r\n\r\nKnowing this Government, it is not unreasonable  to\r\n\r\nassume that what it will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseek  to  do  is, under the camouflage of ostensible\r\n\r\nexpenditure for merger celebrations, to work for the\r\n\r\nelection  of  the P.A.P. candidates, and  perhaps  a\r\n\r\nweek  before Merger Day to have voting day in  order\r\n\r\nto  garner the goodwill of public money spent in the\r\n\r\nparty interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the normal course, that is an issue which the\r\n\r\nOpposition  could well negotiate with  a  Government\r\n\r\nthat  is  constitutional in approach, by seeking  an\r\n\r\namendment  which  would satisfy  the  Opposition  as\r\n\r\nregards  the date for this election. But the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas   consistently  treated  this  House   and   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  with  contempt, as it  has  treated  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore with contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A much wider issue was raised by the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  yesterday and I would like your indulgence\r\n\r\nto  call  the attention of Members of this House  to\r\n\r\nit.  The  Deputy Prime Minister - I am  referring  to\r\n\r\npage  61 of the Unrevised Transcript, Vol. 21 No.  1\r\n\r\ndated 24th July, 1963 - made it quite clear that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment considered this Bill a \"crucial\" Bill and\r\n\r\nthat  if there was a defeat on this Bill then  there\r\n\r\nwould  be elections for the 51 constituencies,  that\r\n\r\nis  to say, the Government will resign. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  on this wider issue, there can be no question.\r\n\r\nNow  that  one  sees on whatever orders  the  former\r\n\r\nS.P.A. had to co-operate with the Government  until\r\n\r\nmerger  agreement was reached, those orders  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger  in force with the Alliance and they  perhaps\r\n\r\ncan  act according to their consciences. No one  can\r\n\r\nbut vote for the downfall of this Government who  is\r\n\r\na citizen of this country and who thinks only of the\r\n\r\nlatest  and  greatest  evil  they  have  perpetrated\r\n\r\nwithout   mandate  from  the  people   and   without\r\n\r\nconsultation with this House - that is the ending  of\r\n\r\nour  traditional economic pattern of life - the ending\r\n\r\nof  our  free port status. I am happy to learn  that\r\n\r\nall  Opposition Members are solidly in agreement and\r\n\r\nthat  all  are here to vote. The people of Singapore\r\n\r\nhave suffered enough. In four years, the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\ncaused  more damage than the British in  140  years.\r\n\r\nThey  have  caused more damage than any group  could\r\n\r\ncause to a comparable mass of people except\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  time  of  war.

The end of our  free  port\r\n\r\nstatus  without reference to the people and to  this\r\n\r\nHouse  proves  to  us that this Government  is  evil\r\n\r\nbeyond any boundary which we can conceive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to vote solidly with my colleagues, whatever\r\n\r\nare  our  differences, on this  side  of  the  House\r\n\r\nagainst the Government for the end of this reign  of\r\n\r\nevil.

He said, \"Let us bring  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  down. But I do not know what the  future\r\n\r\nwill  bring.\"  That is the attitude.  They  are  not\r\n\r\ninterested  in  the future. They are  interested  in\r\n\r\nbringing the Government down. Well, Sir, this is the\r\n\r\nsuper zugzwang the Opposition is in, because we have\r\n\r\nentered  a  new phase.

The position bluntly and\r\n\r\nhonestly  is  this. The Opposition is  opposing  the\r\n\r\nBill   not  because,  as  they  have  claimed,   the\r\n\r\nprovisions in the Bill are improper or because  they\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the  elections  will  be  dishonestly\r\n\r\nconducted or because the provisions are so  weighted\r\n\r\nas  to  favour  the Government in any election,  hut\r\n\r\nbecause  the Opposition, ranging from the  Communist\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, the Communist confrontationists in\r\n\r\nSingapore to the U.P.P. and the S.P.A., do not  want\r\n\r\nto face an election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all their brave and bombastic talk inside and\r\n\r\noutside the Assembly during the past two years  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government was a discredited  force  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  masses were only waiting for a chance  to\r\n\r\nshow  their disapproval of the Government, the blunt\r\n\r\ntruth is that the Opposition and the Communist front\r\n\r\nconfrontationists in the Barisan Sosialis, the Right-wing  S.P.A.,  the U.P.P. and the Member  for  Anson - are  today  terrified  of  facing  the  electorate.\r\n\r\nDuring  the  past  two years, the  Opposition  could\r\n\r\nafford to fling wild challenges at the Government to\r\n\r\nresign  or otherwise to test its strength by way  of\r\n\r\nelections.   They   knew  they  could   make   these\r\n\r\nchallenges   safely  because  the   Government   was\r\n\r\ndetermined  to see merger and Malaysia  through,  to\r\n\r\ndischarge  its election promises and to bring  about\r\n\r\nmerger  and  Malaysia.  The  S.P.A. knew  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was not going to jeopardise  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia by embarking upon elections or by a show of\r\n\r\nstrength  with  the  electorate  which  would   only\r\n\r\nprovide    the    anti-Malaysia   Communists    with\r\n\r\nopportunities  to divert public attention  from  the\r\n\r\nmain issue of merger and Malaysia. Knowing this, the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. could  safely challenge  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nresign  or fight this or that election and thus  try\r\n\r\nto  build up an image of a Government too scared  to\r\n\r\nface the people in an electoral contest. For our own\r\n\r\npart,  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we put up  with  all\r\n\r\nthese  taunts, knowing full well that after we  have\r\n\r\nseen merger and Malaysia through safely we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  call  the S.P.A. bluff. The Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nare  safely  in their seats. They have  not  quitted\r\n\r\ntheir  seats. But they challenged the Government  to\r\n\r\nresign,  knowing  full  well that  this  Government,\r\n\r\nwhatever its other shortcomings, is single-minded in\r\n\r\npurpose.  We  have  said we will  get  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nmerger  through, and we have got it. The  Communists\r\n\r\nin  the  Barisan Sosialis and their confrontationist\r\n\r\nallies, whose stooges they have become in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwill  find  out in 36 days - tomorrow it will  be  35\r\n\r\ndays;  the  day  after tomorrow 34 days -  that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment is purposive and calculating and  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be deviated from its objective of  merger\r\n\r\nand Malaysia until it has merger and Malaysia safely\r\n\r\nin the bag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for two years we have put up with these\r\n\r\ntaunts.  Today  we  have seen  merger  and  Malaysia\r\n\r\nthrough safely, despite attempts by the Barisan,  by\r\n\r\nsome   of   the  S.P.A. leaders  pressurising   the\r\n\r\nGovernment into betraying the interests of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  handing  them over, especially in the  case  of\r\n\r\ncertain S.P.A. leaders, bound over hand and foot, to\r\n\r\ncertain M.C.A. Senators and other M.C.A. elements in\r\n\r\nsearch  of  loot  and  prey in Singapore.  Now  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and merger are safely in the  bag  and  on\r\n\r\nterms  fair and just to both the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  of  Malaysia, we have called the S.P.A. bluff,\r\n\r\nand, as is to be expected, they are in a panic. This\r\n\r\npanic  burst through all the bluster and  rhetorical\r\n\r\nbombast  of the Member for Cairnhill yesterday.  His\r\n\r\nthesis,  for  the best part of two years,  has  been\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. is a discredited force, that it dare\r\n\r\nnot  face the electorate, because the electorate  is\r\n\r\ndying  to vote for an S.P.A. Government. I beg  your\r\n\r\npardon, Sir, The Singapore Alliance. It is no longer\r\n\r\nthe S.P.A. It is not S.P.A. but S.A. Sir, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment is as obliging as ever. It is giving  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. and the Barisan Sosialis a chance  to  prove\r\n\r\ntheir thesis, that the 600,000 electors of Singapore\r\n\r\nare   eager  to  show  their  disapproval   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and its policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has been mourning about\r\n\r\nthe Sembawang by-election.

Sir, the Sembawang by-election  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  - though it would be held - a true indication of\r\n\r\nthe  feelings of the people of Singapore,  1,700,000\r\n\r\nof  them. And, therefore, a nation-wide election for\r\n\r\n15  seats where 600,000 electors can indicate  their\r\n\r\nattitude  towards  the P.A.P., towards  any  of  the\r\n\r\nother  political  Parties, a  better  indication  of\r\n\r\npublic feeling in Singapore.

Therefore, Sir,  instead  of  welcoming\r\n\r\nthis  Bill and pressing the Government to have  this\r\n\r\nby-election as soon as possible and thus proving  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation M.C.A. leaders that the  S.P.A. has\r\n\r\nthe backing of the people -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I notice, Sir, that I was reading\r\n\r\nlast month's issue Volume 5. No. 2. The People.  The\r\n\r\nsymbol  in  the  organ  of  the  Singapore  People's\r\n\r\nAlliance  is a peculiar looking wheel. In Volume  5,\r\n\r\nNo.  3,  the wheel has vanished, Sir, and we have  a\r\n\r\nslow  boat to China. This is an indication  of  what\r\n\r\nthe  political trends are. Sir, I will come to  that\r\n\r\nlater  on.  For  the time being, as far  as  we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  it is the S.P.A., the S.A., or  whatever\r\n\r\nthey like to call themselves. But I am referring not\r\n\r\nto  the  Singapore  Alliance but  to  a  constituent\r\n\r\nmember   of   the  Singapore  Alliance,  because   I\r\n\r\nunderstand the Singapore Alliance consists  of  many\r\n\r\npolitical Parties, of which the S.P.A. is one, if  I\r\n\r\nam not wrong. So they have got a chance, through the\r\n\r\nelections  for  the 15 seats, to  prove  to  certain\r\n\r\nFederation  M.C.A. leaders who have been  trying  to\r\n\r\ninterfere in Singapore politics, trying to build  up\r\n\r\ntheir  outfit  at  the expense of the  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nInstead of the S P.A. welcoming this chance to  show\r\n\r\nthat  the  people of Singapore reject the policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  present  Government, we  find  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  in a blue funk over the prospects  of  an\r\n\r\nelection. It is true that he tried to cover  up  his\r\n\r\npanic  yesterday by a rhetorical bombast  about  his\r\n\r\nreadiness to go to Tanjong Pagar and take the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  on. As far as I can recollect, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill has never fought an election  in  the\r\n\r\nsame constituency twice nor under the same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbanner  twice. Like the lightning, he never  strikes\r\n\r\nin  the  same place twice. Like Lon Chaney, a famous\r\n\r\nactor who is now dead, the Member for Cairnhill is a\r\n\r\nmaster of political disguise. He is the Hunchback of\r\n\r\nNotre  Dime one day, he is the Phantom of the  Opera\r\n\r\nthe  next  day. He is a man of a thousand  political\r\n\r\nfaces. So if he has decided to move out of Cairnhill - I  do  not know if it is in deference to the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin,  because when we  start  grouping  the\r\n\r\nconstituencies there will be a deal of trouble as to\r\n\r\nwhich Member should stand in which constituency  - in\r\n\r\nsearch of fresh political pastures in Tanjong Pagar,\r\n\r\nhe  is  only running true to form. Of course, he  is\r\n\r\nwelcome  to go to Tanjong Pagar because I  think  he\r\n\r\ncan well afford to lose his deposit. Between now and\r\n\r\nthe  elections,  he  may have  second  thoughts,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, about going to Tanjong Pagar if he discovers\r\n\r\n(as the Member for Anson discovered last Sunday)\r\n\r\nthat  he  cannot  profitably exploit  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board  issue.  I  notice  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill has suddenly become interested in the same\r\n\r\nissue  as the Barisan - how to exploit the discontent\r\n\r\nand  strife in the Harbour Board. In fact, long  ago\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Cairnhill revealed his interest  in\r\n\r\nMr Markandu. Mr Markandu approached the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  to  take up this issue.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  tried to intervene by holding a meeting  last\r\n\r\nSunday  in  the  hope of exploiting the  issue.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, in anticipation of  confrontation - you  can see in the newspapers today that they  are\r\n\r\npassing  arms and troops - are going to work  up  and\r\n\r\nstart  off a strike in the Harbour Board. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson,  however, decided to cash in first,  and\r\n\r\nrushed  in. On Friday, after announcing that he  had\r\n\r\napplied  for a meeting to be held at Anson, he  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government were going to  oppose  it.  In\r\n\r\nfact, we had not the slightest intention of opposing\r\n\r\nhim,  but  he  wanted to build up an  atmosphere  of\r\n\r\ntension.  But fortunately on that Friday  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  himself  went  to  the  Harbour  Board  to\r\n\r\nresolve the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen)</b>: Order.

Therefore, Sir, I am not  going  into\r\n\r\ndetails. But since the Member for Cairnhill  brought\r\n\r\nup  this issue yesterday - that he was asked  by  Mr\r\n\r\nMarkandu who was sitting with the Prime Minister  on\r\n\r\nthe  platform  but had nothing to  say  because  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  were manipulating him - he had  shown  an\r\n\r\ninterest  in this political issue, which the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson also tried to response by going there  on\r\n\r\nSunday  and  trying to hold a meeting;  but  it  had\r\n\r\nfizzled  out.  He  got about 300 children,  or  that\r\n\r\nnumber  with  their  parents, and  when  he  shouted\r\n\r\n\"Majulah Singapura\" there was no response. He  asked\r\n\r\nfor  questions; no response. So he got into his  car\r\n\r\nand  drove  away. Now the Member for  Cairnhill  has\r\n\r\ndecided  to step in.

Perhaps it is pertinent for me to explain\r\n\r\nunder what circumstances the editorial was written.\r\n\r\nIt was written at a time when the M.C.A. - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Point of order, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The point of order being?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> What has this S.P.A. editorial\r\n\r\ngot to do with the Bill before the House, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order.\r\n\r\nThe Member should have waited to hear what the\r\n\r\nMinister has to say first. And if what the Minister\r\n\r\nsays has nothing to do with the Bill, then he could\r\n\r\nrise on a point of order. Mr Rajaratnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the Barisan is so perturbed at\r\n\r\nthe  wide  publicity  given to the  S.P.A.,  but  in\r\n\r\ncourse  of  time  I  shall  give  equally  notorious\r\n\r\npublicity to the Barisan too. I hope you could be  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit more patient while I deal with the S.P.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editorial is called \"P.A.P. must go\". Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This is the slogan ringing in the hearts of a vast\r\n\r\nmajority  of men and women of Singapore - the  rural\r\n\r\npeople,  the  trade unionists, taxi  drivers,  petty\r\n\r\ntraders,  businessmen,  civil servants,  housewives,\r\n\r\nand so on.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, if this is the slogan \"ringing in the hearts of\r\n\r\nthe  people\", then why is the S.P.A. opposed to this\r\n\r\nBill?  It  may  be  that what the  S.P.A. want  are\r\n\r\nelections  to  the 51 seats. If that  is  what  they\r\n\r\nwant,  they  can  bring that about quite  easily  by\r\n\r\nvoting against this Bill and thus preventing us from\r\n\r\nhaving  elections  first to  the  15  seats  to  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Parliament.  It  is  very  simple.  If  the\r\n\r\n\"P.A.P. must go\" - that was the clarion cry  of  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. and not of the Singapore Alliance, because it\r\n\r\nhas  no  editorial to that effect  - they  can  bring\r\n\r\nabout  elections  to the 51 seats  first  by  voting\r\n\r\nagainst this Bill. The S P.A. and the Opposition can\r\n\r\nhave whichever way they want - first the elections to\r\n\r\nthe  15  seats  in  the Central  Parliament  or  the\r\n\r\nelections to the 51 seats. But before they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake  up  their  minds, it is necessary  for  me  to\r\n\r\nexplain why they should very carefully consider  the\r\n\r\ndecision  they make - which elections do they  first\r\n\r\nwant? Let me make it quite clear, Sir, that a defeat\r\n\r\nfor  the Government in the elections to the 15 seats\r\n\r\nwould  in itself amount to a vote of censure on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  by  the  people of  Singapore,  and  the\r\n\r\nholding  of  elections to the  51  seats,  including\r\n\r\nSembawang, would become inevitable. It is  a  matter\r\n\r\nof  their deciding which they want first. But  there\r\n\r\nis  one  good  and  responsible  reason  why  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary,  in the interests of merger and  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  of  the people of Singapore, to hold first  the\r\n\r\nelections to the 15 seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is necessary for me to make it quite\r\n\r\nclear why the Government want first the elections to\r\n\r\nthe  15  seats. The Barisan knows it and  maybe  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. also realises it. The Barisan knows that  if\r\n\r\nelections  to  the  15 seats were held  first,  that\r\n\r\nwould  bury them completely. The Government has  not\r\n\r\nbrought this proposal for elections to the 15  seats\r\n\r\nfirst  to  frustrate the S.P.A. or anybody.  We  are\r\n\r\ncarrying  on  the fight against the Communists,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is why we have brought in this proposal.  They\r\n\r\nknow it. I will explain why by holding elections  to\r\n\r\nthe  15 seats it will frustrate the plan of the pro-Communists,   confrontationists,  and  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, as a last-minute attempt, to wreck  merger\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia. The S.P.A. may not be aware of  this,\r\n\r\nbut perhaps in their desperation and greed they have\r\n\r\nbecome  oblivious to this obvious danger  to  merger\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia from these Communist confrontationists\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  As far as the P.A.P. is  concerned,\r\n\r\nthese  elections  to the 15 seats are  part  of  our\r\n\r\nstrategy  to deal yet another blow at the Communists\r\n\r\nand  crush their desperate attempt to wreck Malaysia\r\n\r\nand     give    supporting    action    for    their\r\n\r\nconfrontationist  friends  massing  elsewhere.   The\r\n\r\nCommunists  in  the  Barisan  Sosialis  realise  the\r\n\r\ndanger  posed to them by our proposals by this  Bill\r\n\r\nto  have elections first for the 15 seats, and  that\r\n\r\nis  why  they too are opposing this Bill  under  one\r\n\r\npretext or the other. It is ironical. Sir, that this\r\n\r\ntime the Communists\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  have  as  their  allies  in  this  fight   to\r\n\r\nfrustrate and sabotage merger and Malaysia, the Right-wing  and  opportunist group in the S.P.A.  When  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill yesterday appealed to  all  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to unite to defeat this Bill, the  bleary\r\n\r\neyes  of the despondent Barisan Sosialis lit up  with\r\n\r\nfresh  hope.  They saw in the attitude of  the  S.P.A\r\n\r\nadventurers an opportunity to stave off elections for\r\n\r\nthe 15 seats which could well mean the end of Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   hopes  of  capturing  power  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nthrough  immediate general elections.  The  point  is\r\n\r\nthat  elections  for the 15 seats  do  not  suit  the\r\n\r\nstrategic  aims of the anti-Malaysia confrontationist\r\n\r\nCommunists   in   the  Barisan   Sosialis.   In   the\r\n\r\nunlikelihood of their winning the 15 seats, then they\r\n\r\nwould  not be capturing State power. They know  that.\r\n\r\nThey  can  win  all  the  15  seats  to  the  Central\r\n\r\nParliament.  They  know they are  not  capturing  any\r\n\r\npower  because in an assembly of well over 100 seats,\r\n\r\n15  seats do not give them effective political  power\r\n\r\nto  carry out their anti-Malaysia, anti-merger,  pro-confrontationist  policy.  Their  15  seats  in   the\r\n\r\nCentral  Parliament  could  give  them  no  power  to\r\n\r\nsabotage  Malaysia. Even if they are not calculating,\r\n\r\ntheir  masters are calculating. If in  the  event  of\r\n\r\ntheir winning the majority of the 15 seats, they know\r\n\r\nthe consequences for them would be even more serious.\r\n\r\nBecause  if they should win the majority  of  the  15\r\n\r\nseats, that would only result in a mobilising of  all\r\n\r\nnationalist   pro-merger  forces  against   them   in\r\n\r\npreparation  for the 51 seats. It will  result  in  a\r\n\r\nsequence  of  events which would lead  to  the  utter\r\n\r\nannihilation  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis.   But   the\r\n\r\nprospects are that the Communists, provided we do not\r\n\r\nhave  any  adventurous policies on the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A  resulting  in confusing the  people,  will  be\r\n\r\ndecisively  defeated  in the  elections  for  the  15\r\n\r\nseats.  In  other words, Sir, if they  win  they  get\r\n\r\nnothing; if they lose, they lose everything  - the  15\r\n\r\nseats.  That is part of our strategy. That is why  we\r\n\r\nhave  the elections for the 15 seats first. They know\r\n\r\nit. They laugh, they smile, but - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> You are cheating yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, Sir. We are outwitting them as\r\n\r\nwe have outwitted them in the referendum, and we will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to outwit them till they go back  to  their\r\n\r\nconfrontationist friends outside of  Singapore.  That\r\n\r\nis our objective. We are going to drive every traitor\r\n\r\nout  of Singapore to go and tie-up with their friends\r\n\r\noutside.  That  is  what we intend  to  do  and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  do.  This is the second  phase  of  our\r\n\r\nstrategy. The first phase was defeating them  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum.  Now we will start on the  second  phase.\r\n\r\nThey know that the noose is around their necks and we\r\n\r\nwill  carry on hounding them and destroying  them  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can never be here to play the  traitorous\r\n\r\nrole that they have assigned to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, the real fear of the Ban-san\r\n\r\nSosialis is that if we have the elections for the  15\r\n\r\nseats,  they  know they will be decisively  defeated.\r\n\r\nTheir  stocks are pretty low. A very good  indication\r\n\r\nwas  at a meeting. An indication of the low depth  to\r\n\r\nwhich the morale of the Communists had sunk was  when\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister had a meeting  in  Hong  Lim.  A\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  union  put  up  lights  and  black\r\n\r\nbanners  mourning Malaysia. The Prime  Minister  just\r\n\r\nmade  a  reference and, in fact, read out this banner\r\n\r\ncondemning  Malaysia and that the Prime Minister  had\r\n\r\nsold  out the people of Singapore. It was given  free\r\n\r\npublicity   over  the  radio  and  television.   What\r\n\r\nhappened? The lights went off. They scooted. That was\r\n\r\nwhat the Communists never did. In 1954/55 they fought\r\n\r\nback, Today we only make fun of them and they run for\r\n\r\ncover.  Thousands  of  people  were  watching   them.\r\n\r\nTelevision cameras caught them running and  scooting.\r\n\r\nI  understand  that  a few days later  there  was  an\r\n\r\ninquiry  at  the same premises to find  out  why  the\r\n\r\nCommunists were scooting away before the eyes of  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is our duty, in bringing this election for\r\n\r\nthe  15 seats first, not to hound the S.P.A. or  even\r\n\r\nthe U.P.P. but to carry on the real fight against the\r\n\r\nCommunists. Because we know their stocks  are  pretty\r\n\r\nlow and that is why even the Member for Hong Lim, who\r\n\r\nall  this  while  had avoided attacking  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndirectly, has now picked up enough political courage\r\n\r\nto  attack them openly and with impunity. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong Lim knows the Barisan Sosialis are on  the\r\n\r\nway  out  and all that he is interested  in  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  is inheriting their car-cases. He is a  very\r\n\r\ncautious man. He is not in the habit of hitting  out\r\n\r\nat  people who he knows may hit back at him. But now\r\n\r\nhe  knows  he  can hit back at the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwithout any fear that they can hit back, so much  so\r\n\r\nthat  even in the controversy, he, a one-man  party,\r\n\r\nsilenced  the Barisan Sosialis outfit. They  had  no\r\n\r\ncome-back and no reply. They said, \"Please call  off\r\n\r\nthis  controversy.\" That is the state of  morale  of\r\n\r\nthe Communists, the Barisan Sosialis, today -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> So what are you so afraid of?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is why they are afraid to go\r\n\r\nto elections for the 15 seats -[Interruption].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen)</b>: Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They are afraid of that.

By having elections\r\n\r\nto  the  15 seats first, it is the objective of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  crush and paralyse  politically  the\r\n\r\nCommunist confrontationists as decisively as we  did\r\n\r\ncrush  them during the referendum. And by paralysing\r\n\r\nthe  Communist confrontationists politically in  the\r\n\r\nelections  for  the 15 seats, we  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  Communists  will  not  be  in   a\r\n\r\nposition,  when the elections for the 51  seats  are\r\n\r\nheld,  to  capture State power, which is  what  they\r\n\r\nwant.  They are not interested so much in  capturing\r\n\r\npower  in the Central Government where their  forces\r\n\r\nor their position cannot be used effectively. By the\r\n\r\nprocess of having elections first for the 15  seats,\r\n\r\nwe  can ensure that they will not have the slightest\r\n\r\nhope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  ever  being able to capture power in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe    Barisan   Sosialis   and   their    Communist\r\n\r\nconfrontationists see this clearly. That is why they\r\n\r\nare opposing this Bill to have elections for the  15\r\n\r\nseats.  What they want now are elections for the  51\r\n\r\nseats  first, for different reasons from the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nBut  as far as they are concerned, they want to have\r\n\r\nelections  for  the  51 seats first.  In  a  general\r\n\r\nelection they would have a slender chance of winning\r\n\r\nState  power  before 31st August  if  possible,  and\r\n\r\nrepudiating the Malaysia and Merger agreement.  Then\r\n\r\nthey  can  demand an independent Singapore  and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  try to implement Mr Lim  Ching  Siong's\r\n\r\nplea  for  merger  with Indonesia in  preference  to\r\n\r\nmerger with Malaya. That is what they want. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  they are scared to death of elections first  to\r\n\r\nthe  15  seats.

I  was  explaining why  we  think  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to have elections first for the 15  seats.\r\n\r\nThe  main  objective  to  pursue  is  to  block  the\r\n\r\nCommunists last-minute effort to sabotage merger and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  But the S.P.A., the Member for Anson  and\r\n\r\nthe U.P.P. can help the Communists to get out of the\r\n\r\nsuper  zugzwang by defeating this Bill. If what  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  want  are elections for  the  51  seats,\r\n\r\nwell,  let the elections for the 51 seats take place\r\n\r\nfirst. I understand that the Member for Anson is  in\r\n\r\nhere  for the kill, as he was telling the Press  and\r\n\r\neverybody. Yes, Sir, there will be a kill,  and  the\r\n\r\ntoreador will be the P.A.P. exhibiting his  ears  to\r\n\r\nthe audience and to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

He played\r\n\r\n\"hooty-hooty\" with the Communists, and his Party was\r\n\r\nlost.  Today  he  is  a motherless  orphan  prowling\r\n\r\naround  Anson  in  the hope that  he  could  exploit\r\n\r\nsituations  created by the Barisan. As it  is,  last\r\n\r\nSunday  he was there ready to help put out the  fire\r\n\r\nwith  tins  of  kerosine  he  was  pouring  in.  But\r\n\r\nunfortunately for him, there were 300 gentlemen  who\r\n\r\nwere  not  even  interested in  his  report  to  the\r\n\r\nnation. He made one of his rare reports - it was  his\r\n\r\nthird  report  by  which he  hoped  to  exploit  the\r\n\r\nsituation in the Harbour Board. It turned out to  be\r\n\r\na flop. Anyway, Sir, that is his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble with running with the hare and hunting\r\n\r\nwith  the  hounds  is  that  the  hounds  insist  on\r\n\r\nregarding  him  as  a  hare:  the  hare  insists  on\r\n\r\nregarding him as a hound. He gets into trouble  both\r\n\r\nways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to the point. We shall know today\r\n\r\nwhether the Right, wing and other opportunist groups\r\n\r\nare  going to help the Communists get out  of  their\r\n\r\ndifficulty. The S.P.A. have not the slightest chance\r\n\r\nof  winning any elections. They know it, whether  it\r\n\r\nis  for  the  15  or  for the 51 seats.  If  in  the\r\n\r\nunlikely  event of the P.A.P. losing any  elections,\r\n\r\nit  would  be the Barisan who would win. They  still\r\n\r\nsay  that  the biggest force is not the  Barisan  as\r\n\r\nsuch, but the powerful gentlemen behind them. I  see\r\n\r\nin today's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npaper, \"SOEKARNO THREATENING CONFRONTATION\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, Sir, that things are boiling up. So it is\r\n\r\nnot  the  Barisan that we are interested in -  these\r\n\r\nare 14 gentlemen and gentle ladies whose time is up.\r\n\r\nWe  are not interested in them nor in the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Then, why do they not resign?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - because it is very simple. Whether\r\n\r\nit be for 15 or 51 seats, whether in the course of a\r\n\r\nfew  days  or a few weeks, there will be  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nabsent faces from this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You will not be here either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, when the gentleman can go to\r\n\r\nAnson and collect 300 disinterested men, I have  not\r\n\r\nthe  slightest  doubt what his political  future  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be - whether in Anson, Cairnhill, or Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.  I hope the Member for Anson will follow  the\r\n\r\ngood example of the Member for Hong Lim and possibly\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Cairnhill by testing strength  with\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister in Tanjong Pagar. Anyway, I would\r\n\r\nsuggest  if  the  S.P.A. have the interests  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  at heart as they claim, then the  elections\r\n\r\nto  the  15 seats would show the correctness of  our\r\n\r\nanalysis as to the potential strength of the various\r\n\r\npolitical Parties in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to the S.P.A. and all those Members\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition who, however they  may  disagree\r\n\r\nwith  us politically, are interested in safeguarding\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  that they should support our strategy  of\r\n\r\nhaving  elections  for the 15 seats  first.  If  our\r\n\r\nthesis  is  correct,  that  it  is  a  case  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists - not the Barisan Sosialis, they  are  the\r\n\r\nfacade - winning if the P.A.P. loses,  then  the  pro-Malaysia  forces  would  be  able  to  adjust  their\r\n\r\nstrategy   correctly   and  accordingly   when   the\r\n\r\nelections  for the 51 seats are held.  Because  from\r\n\r\nthe  Communist point of view, the real  struggle  is\r\n\r\nnot  for the 15 seats but for the 51 seats.  If  the\r\n\r\nelections for the 15 seats show that only the S.P.A.\r\n\r\nor  the  U.P.P. are the best counters to  the  anti-Malaysia  Communists,  confrontationists,  then  the\r\n\r\npeople as well as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P. would  in the interests of  the  country  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to make the necessary adjustment when  the\r\n\r\nelections  for the 51 seats are held.  That  is  the\r\n\r\npurpose of the 15 seats - testing strength to the  15\r\n\r\nseats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as the S.P.A. claim, that in the hearts of the\r\n\r\nvast majority - the slogan that rings in the hearts\r\n\r\nof the vast majority of the people is that \"THE P.A.P.MUST GO!\" - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Which paper is that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sorry, Sir, it is the S.P.A. organ,\r\n\r\nVolume 5, No. 2, before it became the Singapore\r\n\r\nAlliance organ -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am not interested in that Date?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Volume 5, No. 2, dated 15th June,\r\n\r\n1963. But if, as we believe, the best counter to the\r\n\r\nCommunists is the P.A.P., then elections to  the  15\r\n\r\nseats  would  show whether our analysis is  correct,\r\n\r\nand  then the other pro-Malaysia groups - whether  of\r\n\r\nthe  Right, Centre, Left - which want to prevent  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  from capturing State power in  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  make  the necessary adjustment  for  general\r\n\r\nelections for the 51 seats. All of us who  are  pro-Malaysia are only interested in countering the anti-Malaysia  elements.  It is no use,  saying,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson said, \"Yes, bring down the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nbring  down  this,\" and he ended up  his  speech  by\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"I do not know what the future will bring.\"\r\n\r\nWe  want to ensure what the future is for the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore. The Member for Anson may not care what\r\n\r\nthe  future brings. He has been in politics;  he  is\r\n\r\nnot  interested in what the future of the people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is. But we are interested, Sir, and  every\r\n\r\npro-Malaysia element is interested in ensuring  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  safeguarded against the  anti-Malaysia\r\n\r\nconfrontationists,  the  Communists,   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis in Singapore. That is our objective. If the\r\n\r\nelections for the 15 seats show that the P.A.P. is a\r\n\r\ndiscredited  force, then I can assure you  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will allow other forces, who can show to  the\r\n\r\nelectorate for the 15 seats that they are best  able\r\n\r\nto  counter the Communists, to do so; then  we  will\r\n\r\nadjust\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour   policy  accordingly.  That  is  what  we   are\r\n\r\ninterested in. For two years we have fought hard  to\r\n\r\nbring about merger and Malaysia. We are not prepared\r\n\r\nto  jeopardise it in the interests of the Communists\r\n\r\nor  their  stooges  who hope to  capitalise  on  any\r\n\r\nsituation that the Communist might create.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Sir, these elections to the 15\r\n\r\nseats would be of great help - would be an indication - to the people as well as the pro-Malaysia group to\r\n\r\ndevise  the correct strategy, an effective strategy,\r\n\r\nto  prevent the Communists from capturing  power  in\r\n\r\nthe general elections. That is the whole purpose  of\r\n\r\nthis operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis know it.\r\n\r\nThat  is why they are bitterly opposed to this  Bill\r\n\r\nto provide elections for the 15 seats to the Central\r\n\r\nParliament.  That  is why I believe  that  all  pro-Malaysia  groups  in the Opposition  should  support\r\n\r\nthis  Bill.  If they are opposing this  Bill  simply\r\n\r\nbecause their election prospects are not good,  then\r\n\r\nwhen  the time comes, the inevitable consequence  of\r\n\r\nnot  having  the elections for the 15 seats  is  the\r\n\r\nCommunists winning the elections for the  51  seats,\r\n\r\nand  the  people  would  also  have  to  make  their\r\n\r\nadjustment.  In this connection, Sir, what  are  the\r\n\r\ngrounds  on  which this Bill is being  opposed?  One\r\n\r\ncomplaint  put  forward by the Member for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nis,  well,  why  hold elections for  the  15  seats?\r\n\r\nBecause  sometime next year there  will  be  general\r\n\r\nelections  for the whole of the Central  Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou  will be wasting $380,000 for nothing.  But  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Home Affairs has made it  quite  clear\r\n\r\nthat those who are elected from Singapore for the 15\r\n\r\nseats  would  hold  their  seats  until  the  second\r\n\r\ndissolution  of  the  Central  Parliament;  so  that\r\n\r\nargument falls to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, this decision to hold elections to\r\n\r\nthe Central Parliament has the sanction and approval\r\n\r\nof  the Federation Government. Therefore this is not\r\n\r\nsome  plot  cooked  up  by the  P.A.P.  The  Central\r\n\r\nFederation  Government itself approves  of  this  in\r\n\r\nprinciple.  What reasons have they  to  oppose  this\r\n\r\nBill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason has been put forward at least by\r\n\r\nThe  People  introducing the Singapore  Alliance  of\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O., M.C.A., M.I.C. and S.P.A. Volume 5, No. 3,\r\n\r\n22nd  July,  1963. They suggest, why have elections,\r\n\r\nwhy not nominate? I will tell you why. Again because\r\n\r\nof our own objective to conscribe the Communists and\r\n\r\nanti-Malaysia  forces. If we have  nominations  from\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber, what will be the result? Proportional\r\n\r\nnomination?    Who    will    have    the    largest\r\n\r\nrepresentation?    The    anti-Malaysia    Communist\r\n\r\nconfrontationists to have about half - 7 or 8  seats.\r\n\r\nSo  by  nomination we are giving a free gift to  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  to get into the Central Parliament!  The\r\n\r\nMember   for   Anson,  of  course,  is  opposed   to\r\n\r\nnomination because he knows that after the  division\r\n\r\nthere will be only half the seats left for the other\r\n\r\ngroups. But, we feel that we should not allow  anti-Malaysia  pro-confrontationists to get  free  seats,\r\n\r\nget in by the back door into the Central Parliament.\r\n\r\nBut,  by  having elections to the 15 seats,  we  can\r\n\r\ndeal  the Communists a crushing blow; we can  defeat\r\n\r\nthem. Therefore, the power for a comeback for the 15\r\n\r\nseats for the Communists will be reduced to zero  in\r\n\r\nthe eyes of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Make it 51 seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  will  get a chance possibly if  he  succeeds.\r\n\r\nWherever he goes, I can guarantee him, that he  will\r\n\r\nnot   get  a  look-in,  because  in  the  last  1959\r\n\r\nelections,  he  could not even contest  against  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill. He nearly lost his  deposit.\r\n\r\nEvery  one  knew  that he won in  Anson  because  of\r\n\r\nCommunist  support.  [Laughter]  That  is  why  they\r\n\r\nlaugh,  Sir.  They  know. When he spoke  on  Sunday,\r\n\r\nthere were only 300 people. During the election when\r\n\r\nthe   Barisan  Sosialis  and  the  Communists  could\r\n\r\nmobilise the crowd, the Member for Anson was  beside\r\n\r\nhimself  with joy. The whole of Singapore was  there\r\n\r\nbecause they mobilised the crowd. Unless he wants to\r\n\r\ngo back to run with the hare and experience the same\r\n\r\nhumiliation that he did when the Communists  pinched\r\n\r\nhis own Party, as he himself admitted. That is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy  business. Sir, I am only interested in  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  what  we  have struggled for in the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears  to  get  merger and Malaysia is  safeguarded,\r\n\r\nbecause  after 31st August, the battle  to  preserve\r\n\r\nmerger and Malaysia enters a new phase. We are going\r\n\r\nto  have  other enemies, more powerful ones who  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  break up merger and Malaysia. A gentleman\r\n\r\nhas already been invited to Medan to become part  of\r\n\r\nthe  anti-Malaysia forces. The anti-Malaysia  forces\r\n\r\nbecome  bigger and more powerful and it is our  duty\r\n\r\nto see that there is no fifth column in Singapore to\r\n\r\nsell  out their own people, to be looted by  outside\r\n\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why we want elections to the\r\n\r\nCentral Parliament first is that it is necessary  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  15 who are in the Central Parliament  can\r\n\r\nspeak  with  authority.  They  can  say  that   they\r\n\r\nrepresent  the people, that they were voted  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  that they are not there on  sufferance,\r\n\r\nnot  there  because they came in by the  back  door.\r\n\r\nTherefore  we must elect these 15 Members to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat they are there, whoever they are, as people who\r\n\r\ncan  say that they represent the will of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. It is claimed now that  obviously  we\r\n\r\nare  trying  to hold a snap election,  sneak  in  an\r\n\r\nelection  by  bringing  this Bill.  Sir,  all  these\r\n\r\nprofessions  of  surprise over  this  Bill,  of  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of a snap election by the S.P.A. is  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  humbug. In the Malayan Times of 24th  June,\r\n\r\n1963, before the Prime Minister went to London,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Alliance  was  preparing  to  fight   for\r\n\r\nelections before 31st August. I refer to a news item\r\n\r\nentitled \"Singapore Alliance To Try All Seats\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The newly formed Singapore Alliance will contest\r\n\r\nall  15  seats  allotted to  Singapore  in  the  new\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Parliament.  This  was  disclosed  by  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of U.M.N.O., Singapore, Dato  Syed\r\n\r\nEsa Almenoar, today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U M.N.O. leader said that the inaugural meeting\r\n\r\nof the Singapore Alliance's new Executive Council to\r\n\r\nbe  held  tomorrow  would,  amongst  other  matters,\r\n\r\ndiscuss the parliamentary elections expected  to  be\r\n\r\nheld before Malaysia Day.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  was  as  far  back as 24th  June,  before  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia   Agreement  was  signed.   The   Singapore\r\n\r\nAlliance  was working on the basis that there  would\r\n\r\nbe  elections  before  31st  August.  There  was  no\r\n\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore now to say that we are sneaking in a  snap\r\n\r\nelection  by  bringing  in  this  Bill  is   I   say\r\n\r\ncompletely   not   in  accordance   with   Singapore\r\n\r\nAlliance's attitude towards the whole thing prior to\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has been publishing a\r\n\r\nseries  of  articles  in his paper  saying  that  he\r\n\r\nexpects  snap  elections before  Malaysia  by  July.\r\n\r\nAgain   on  11th  July,  1963,  when  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  invited the Opposition Members  to  send\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  to  a  meeting  to  decide  on  the\r\n\r\ndelineation  of  51  constituencies,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAlliance  was  quite prepared to participate  in  it\r\n\r\nand, in fact, the S.P.A. Secretary-General. Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nKim  Chuan,  said  that Tun Lim Yew  Hock  had  been\r\n\r\nselected  to represent the Party at the meeting  and\r\n\r\nadded,  \"We  are  prepared to  meet  the  P.A.P. at\r\n\r\nelections any time, anywhere and anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Which paper is that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Straits Times, Sir, of 11th\r\n\r\nJuly, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, everybody for the last one month at least has\r\n\r\nbeen  working  on  the  basis  that  there  will  be\r\n\r\nelections for the 15 seats soon. What is it that has\r\n\r\nmade  them  suddenly change their minds: that  there\r\n\r\nshould be no elections and that it would be improper\r\n\r\nto have elections for the Central Parliament as soon\r\n\r\nas  possible? May I suggest that I do not know  what\r\n\r\nthe  reasons  are?  I do not know  who  gives  these\r\n\r\ndirectives.  But  the people of Singapore  would  be\r\n\r\nresentful  if  the representatives  to  the  Central\r\n\r\nParliament  should  be by way of  nomination.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  other things, this will give a free  voice  to\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  in the Central Parliament,  to  add\r\n\r\ntheir  voice  to  the  possible  intensification  of\r\n\r\nconfrontation after 31st August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other objection raised was, \"Oh yes, we cannot\r\n\r\ntrust   this  present  `Government  to  run   honest\r\n\r\nelections;  therefore we must oppose the  provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill which will ensure crooked  and  unfair\r\n\r\nelections.\" But the Opposition line on this has been\r\n\r\nrather  strange.  Under  this  Government,  we  have\r\n\r\ntested the will of the electorate three times. First\r\n\r\nin  Hong  Lim.  But they say, no,  that  was  honest\r\n\r\nbecause the Government lost; so that must be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhonest.  Anson, the Government lost;  therefore,  it\r\n\r\nmust be honest. If the Government is crooked, if the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants to carry out dishonest  elections,\r\n\r\nit   is  easy  to  fix  crooked  elections  in   one\r\n\r\nconstituency. But their argument is this, that in so\r\n\r\nfar as the Opposition can win an election that is an\r\n\r\nhonest election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we had the Referendum. The gentlemen were\r\n\r\nthere:  everybody was there. Before they  lost,  Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Ching Siong was quite confident that they  were\r\n\r\ngoing  to win, that there would be more blank votes.\r\n\r\nBut  after they lost, when the votes were counted  - they were there till half-past five, six or nine;  I\r\n\r\nforget now, throughout the morning - then they  said,\r\n\r\n\"No,  dishonest Referendum, crooked Referendum.\"  In\r\n\r\nfact,  on one occasion, the Barisan Sosialis  leader\r\n\r\nasked  for a recount. We wanted to recount,  but  he\r\n\r\nran  away. Therefore, if they lose an election or  a\r\n\r\ncause,  it  must be dishonest. If they  win,  it  is\r\n\r\nhonest.  Therefore, by implication,  what  are  they\r\n\r\ntrying  to do now? They are trying to build  up  the\r\n\r\natmosphere  now that any elections held for  the  15\r\n\r\nconstituencies  will be crooked, because  they  know\r\n\r\nthat  they are going to lose. So they like to  build\r\n\r\nup   the   atmosphere   of  a   crooked   Government\r\n\r\nmanipulating  and  fixing elections.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Member for Cairnhill yesterday echoed  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis propaganda that the referendum  was\r\n\r\nfixed  and  dishonest. In his speech,  at  first  he\r\n\r\nsaid, \"We cannot trust the Government. It interferes\r\n\r\nwith the Election Supervisor, and so on.\" He is also\r\n\r\nhelping to build up such an atmosphere knowing  full\r\n\r\nwell what the outcome of the next elections will be.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he feels it would be better to  build  up\r\n\r\nnow  the  image of a dishonest government  which  is\r\n\r\ngoing to fix up the elections. But none of them have\r\n\r\nproduced any such evidence in the Bill. Is there any\r\n\r\nclause  in  the  Bill  which is improper  and  which\r\n\r\nsuggests  that  the  elections have  been  fixed  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  the Government? There have been  general\r\n\r\nallegations of possible dishonesty, but no  one  has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  there is anything in the Bill  which  is\r\n\r\nimproper  and  dishonest. But they  are  not  really\r\n\r\ninterested in the Bill or in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill. What they are afraid  of  is\r\n\r\nthat  outside  of the Bill the conditions  are  such\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  has a  very  good  chance  of\r\n\r\nwinning an election. That is what they are afraid of - not  of  the provisions of the Bill; we can  change\r\n\r\nthem  in  any  way we like. They know  that  in  any\r\n\r\nelections the Government will win. That is what they\r\n\r\nobject to  - that the Government should be foolish and\r\n\r\ndishonest enough to fight the elections to win. That\r\n\r\nis the substance of their charge: this Government is\r\n\r\ndishonest  because it is going to an election  at  a\r\n\r\ntime  when  it knows it will win. What  they  really\r\n\r\nwant is for the Government to go into an election at\r\n\r\na time when it knows that it will lose. That is what\r\n\r\nthey  want.  Surely,  Sir,  that  is  nothing.   Any\r\n\r\nGovernment,  whether it is the P.A.P. Government  or\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.A. government, would like to win at a  time\r\n\r\nwhen it thinks its chances of winning are good. That\r\n\r\nis  the purpose of any democratic government, first,\r\n\r\nto  do things to ensure that it will win and to have\r\n\r\nelections  at  a  time when it  thinks  it  is  most\r\n\r\nfavourable  to it. That happens in every  democratic\r\n\r\ncountry. Snap elections are held everywhere. We  are\r\n\r\nsurely  not fools enough to fight an election  at  a\r\n\r\ntime  when we know we are going to lose, just  like,\r\n\r\nsay,  two  years ago when the Barisan  deserted  us.\r\n\r\nProbably  our  stocks were low then. Probably  there\r\n\r\nwould  have been great cheers from the Barisan  side\r\n\r\nand  the  Communists  if we had gone  for  elections\r\n\r\nthen.  But during the last two years, thanks to  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  these Gentlemen left, we  were  able  to\r\n\r\nconsolidate  our position, fight and  come  back  to\r\n\r\nhound them out of the political arena of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, none of the Opposition Members have\r\n\r\nyet  dealt  with the provisions of the Bill  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  anything  in  it  is irregular,  improper  and\r\n\r\nundemocratic. They have complained in the  past  and\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Yes, the P.A.P. are using propaganda.\" It  is\r\n\r\nour  business  to use propaganda to ensure  that  we\r\n\r\nwin, especially against the Communists. In fact, the\r\n\r\nmain part of the fight has been to circumscribe to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefeat the Communists. We will continue to do it, to\r\n\r\nuse   every   opportunity,  if  necessary  political\r\n\r\nstrategy,  to  outmanoeuvre and conscribe  them.  We\r\n\r\nhave done that for the last two years and we will do\r\n\r\nit  for  the next 20 years. The Communists  will  be\r\n\r\nhere  for 20 years, 30 years, 50 years. The  Barisan\r\n\r\nmay be out, the Member for Anson may be out, but the\r\n\r\nCommunists will be here, and it is our duty to fight\r\n\r\nthem  and  keep  them under control.  Therefore,  to\r\n\r\nclaim that this Bill is dishonest, that by this Bill\r\n\r\nwe  are  going  to have snap elections,  definitely,\r\n\r\nSir,  we will have elections at a time when we think\r\n\r\nwe   are  going  to  win.  Just  as  if  the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\ngovernment  were  on  this  side  they  would   have\r\n\r\nelections  at  a time they think they are  going  to\r\n\r\nwin.  If the Barisan were here, there would probably\r\n\r\nbe  no  elections  at all; so the problem  does  not\r\n\r\narise.  But  I  would suggest to the  Opposition  to\r\n\r\ndisabuse  their  minds  that  this  Bill   to   have\r\n\r\nelections first for 15 seats is directed against the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. or  anybody  else, but  I  say  that  it  is\r\n\r\nprimarily  directed against the Communists.  We  ask\r\n\r\nthem  to  consider carefully whether  they  want  to\r\n\r\nallow the Communists to achieve what they want - that\r\n\r\nis, to have an election first for 51 seats. Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  an election for 51 seats as far  as  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  concerned, we will still  fight  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and we are confident that  we  can  beat\r\n\r\nthem and crush them, as we think we can. To make  it\r\n\r\nmore  difficult,  more  tricky,  might  confuse  the\r\n\r\nsituation. But the other way, we guarantee  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  contain  and  conscribe the Communists  before\r\n\r\n31st August, or not long after that. Politically, we\r\n\r\nwill  contain them. And that is the object  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.  If  the S.P.A. wants to play party  politics,\r\n\r\nthat  is  a different thing; we also can play  party\r\n\r\npolitics  up to a point. They have been  doing  that\r\n\r\nfor  the last four years. But during the referendum,\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.A.,  all the pro-Malaysia elements  and  we\r\n\r\ncontained  ourselves; we curbed our party  political\r\n\r\nrivalry  and we were able to contain and  drive  out\r\n\r\nthe   Communists.  And  I  say,  Sir,  whatever  our\r\n\r\nobjectives, we should try and do the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame  because  in about 36 days Malaysia  will  come\r\n\r\nabout,  our gentlemen the Communists will be hopping\r\n\r\naround.  I saw in the paper today that confrontation\r\n\r\nis  back in circulation. It is our duty to keep  the\r\n\r\nfifth columnists under check.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill for elections to the 15 seats will allow\r\n\r\nus  to  expose  the Communists in the  eyes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  to get the people to repudiate them openly,\r\n\r\npublicly,  so that any confrontationist  who  thinks\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  a  fifth  column  here  politically\r\n\r\neffective  will have the biggest shock of his  life.\r\n\r\nThat  is what we want to do. Have the elections  for\r\n\r\nthe 15 seats so that the confrontationists will say,\r\n\r\n\"Our allies have been repudiated by the people,\" and\r\n\r\nwe are quite confident that we can get the people to\r\n\r\nrepudiate them in an election for 15 seats. That  is\r\n\r\nwhat we want to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, if it is to be 51 seats first, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  ready, though there  are  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nrisks;  15 seats first, we are quite convinced  that\r\n\r\nwe can not only crush the Communists but we can also\r\n\r\nannihilate their agents, finish them off politically\r\n\r\nand  then after that, if the S.P.A. or anybody wants\r\n\r\nto play party politics, at least the ground is safe.\r\n\r\nEven  the Member for Anson can join in, but at least\r\n\r\nwhen  we  join in the fray, there will  not  be  the\r\n\r\nslightest threat to Malaysia and merger from  inside\r\n\r\nSingapore,   from  the  traitors  who  have   become\r\n\r\nstooges,  puppets of foreign forces.  This  Bill  is\r\n\r\ntheir political death warrant, and that is why, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe have brought it to this Assembly today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr C. H.

I  do  not\r\n\r\nbelong  to any Party, Mr Speaker, Sir, and  I  will\r\n\r\nsay this: they have built many houses for the masses\r\n\r\nand  we  are glad of it, and they have done probably\r\n\r\nmany good things. And, therefore, I have a bit of  a\r\n\r\nheadache. I do not know what attitude I should  take\r\n\r\nexcept  that I have for my background the spirit  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy. It is not fair, Mr Speaker, to  rest  an\r\n\r\nimportant  matter  like this - the  survival  or  the\r\n\r\ndownfall  of the P.A.P.

As far as I can remember, when the Member for Hong Lim joined the P.A.P., he was\r\n\r\nintroduced by our present Minister for Culture. When\r\n\r\nhe  was about to be expelled from the P.A.P. in  the\r\n\r\nCultural Centre, he openly confessed to us that  his\r\n\r\npolitical  education was influenced by the  ideology\r\n\r\nof the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand   the  Minister  for  Culture.

Because the Bill is drafted according to the needs\r\n\r\nof  the nation, that is why it is introduced in this\r\n\r\nHouse today. Where have we been wrong in introducing\r\n\r\nthis  Bill? Of course, the Barisan Sosialis Members,\r\n\r\nwho  have  all  along been opposed to  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nmerger,  will say whatever we do is wrong.

They are not concerned  with  this\r\n\r\nmatter  of  elections. What is  uppermost  in  their\r\n\r\nminds is the fact that if they support this Bill, it\r\n\r\nmeans  they  will  be supporting Malaysia.  That  is\r\n\r\ntheir  fear. If the 15 representatives are  elected,\r\n\r\nthen, before this happens, the Barisan Sosialis will\r\n\r\nbe  exposed. Their past actions and intrigue will be\r\n\r\nexposed.  Of  course,  at the time  of  their  death\r\n\r\nthroes they will have to oppose this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, talking about the Member for Cairnhill,\r\n\r\nwhenever people touch on his S.P.A., he feels rather\r\n\r\nabashed  and  would  like  people  to  call  it  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Alliance. In actual fact,  there  is  not\r\n\r\nmuch difference between the S.P.A. and the Singapore\r\n\r\nAlliance, because to a politician like him,  who  is\r\n\r\nchanging party names all the time, there is no  true\r\n\r\nparty  to him. This sort of people every day  change\r\n\r\ntheir label in the same way as they can change their\r\n\r\nstand every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members on this side of the House have the\r\n\r\nimpression  that whenever the Member  for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nspeaks,  there are gold dollar trade  marks  on  his\r\n\r\nface, reflecting his political conception.

But\r\n\r\nalthough  they are trying very hard to get together,\r\n\r\nI  am  going to tell them now that in spite  of  all\r\n\r\ntheir  efforts, it is impossible. Although they  are\r\n\r\non  the  same bed, they are having different dreams.\r\n\r\nWhy do I say this? Well, although in this House they\r\n\r\nseem  to  have common .arguments to the effect  that\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. is undemocratic and that it has tried  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  the  parliamentary  democratic  system   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  want to ask them, is  there  anything\r\n\r\nundemocratic in our Bill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are unable to answer this question. So I am\r\n\r\ngoing  to deal with their arguments point by  point,\r\n\r\nto  disclose the fact that though they  are  on  the\r\n\r\nsame bed, they are having different dreams. All\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalong  we have been saying that the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nare  getting  worried about this Bill and  they  are\r\n\r\ntrying  their  best  to oppose  it.  Every  thinking\r\n\r\nperson  will understand the simple reason -that  is,\r\n\r\nfrom   the  very  outset,  they  have  been  against\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Although they are against Malaysia and  in\r\n\r\nspite of what they do to oppose it, it will come  on\r\n\r\nthe  31st of August, 1953. Malaysia will be born  by\r\n\r\nthen.  At  the present juncture, their  leaders  are\r\n\r\ntaking their instructions from foreign sources as to\r\n\r\nhow to deal a final blow at the possible creation of\r\n\r\nMalaysia. That is their aim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If my recollection is correct, that is\r\n\r\nthe  exact  argument  put up  by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture. May we therefore have something new?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): But there is\r\n\r\nanother  part  which  is quite  different  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture's speech. And that is,  because\r\n\r\nof  this  the Barisan Sosialis try to have  a  final\r\n\r\nshowdown  so that before Malaysia is born the  whole\r\n\r\nof   Singapore   and  the  whole  of  the   Malaysia\r\n\r\nterritories will have confusion, so that there  will\r\n\r\nbe  a riot in Singapore before Malaysia, in order to\r\n\r\ndestroy  Malaysia  entirely. That is  the  intention\r\n\r\nbehind their opposition to this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To follow up the speech of the leader of the United\r\n\r\nPeople's Party. I will say that he is today opposing\r\n\r\nthis  Bill for this reason. Originally in their  own\r\n\r\nParty  organ, the Party have said that  the  Central\r\n\r\nParliament elections are just around the corner. But\r\n\r\nwhy  should  they  oppose this  Bill?  Well,  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause they know that if Malaysia is established on\r\n\r\nthe 31st of August this year, the Central Government\r\n\r\nwill  have  some  control over  every  State  within\r\n\r\nMalaysia, and in their minds, they hone that by then\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis will have  to  put  up  their\r\n\r\nshutters,  because  they will be controlled  by  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government. By then they  hope  the  U.P.P.\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to have something without any effort.\r\n\r\nThey  can shout the slogans of the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nwear  their  gloves, and then try to get  something.\r\n\r\nAnd   so   they  want  this  election   of   Federal\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to be held after Malaysia,  so  that\r\n\r\nthey may have a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchance  of  being returned to the Central Parliament\r\n\r\nto curry out their party propaganda therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to analyse the arguments of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Alliance. Everybody is clear  in  his\r\n\r\nmind  that  the Lim Yew Hock Government had  made  a\r\n\r\nvery bad impression on the people of Singapore. From\r\n\r\nthe  young to the old, I believe everybody will  not\r\n\r\nforget  what impression the Lim Yew Hock  Government\r\n\r\nhas left in the minds of the people of Singapore. So\r\n\r\ndo  they  really have the guts to compete  with  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in this election? Although Mr Lim Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nhimself  has challenged the P.A.P. and said that  he\r\n\r\nis  prepared to fight the P.A.P. at any time and  in\r\n\r\nany  place,  and  he  has pointed  out  that  he  is\r\n\r\nparticularly  interested  in  fighting   the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in the Tanjong Pagar constituency, why does\r\n\r\nhe then want to oppose this Bill? The reason is very\r\n\r\nsimple.  It  is  because he himself  has  said  very\r\n\r\nclearly  that according to procedures, this election\r\n\r\nof  Federal  representatives should  be  held  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia. And so the Bill should be introduced  only\r\n\r\nafter  Malaysia.  That is his  argument.  But  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia,   his   elder  brother,   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and his own colleagues will  give  them\r\n\r\nall  sorts  of  facilities and afford  them  special\r\n\r\nconveniences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

From the speeches  made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition Members yesterday and today,  it  is\r\n\r\nclear  that their objection is not against the  Bill\r\n\r\nas  such. What they really object to is the  holding\r\n\r\nof  an election of 15 seats to the Federal House  of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives  now  or in  the  immediate  future.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  United People's  Party,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   and   the  Singapore  People's   Alliance\r\n\r\ndeclared  publicly that they were ready to  take  on\r\n\r\nany   election  at  any  time,  they  were  in  fact\r\n\r\nhorrified  at the prospect of an impending election.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  why should they oppose this  Bill  which\r\n\r\nonly provides for the machinery to hold an election?\r\n\r\nAlthough the Opposition Parties are opposed  to  one\r\n\r\nanother  ideologically,  yet  on  this  question  of\r\n\r\nopposition  to  elections to the  Federal  House  of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives, they are on common ground. And what\r\n\r\nbetter  means of preventing elections to the Federal\r\n\r\nHouse  of  Representatives than  opposition  to  the\r\n\r\npassage  of this Bill in this Assembly? Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  to enable an election to the Federal House  of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives to be held, there must be this  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  provides for the machinery and the  procedure\r\n\r\nto  organise  an  election.  Without  this  Bill  no\r\n\r\nelection  can be held. Hence, Mr Speaker, Sir,  all\r\n\r\nthe  opposition to this Bill is nothing but a  cloak\r\n\r\nto  hide  their  real  intention  of  preventing  an\r\n\r\nelection  to  the  Federal House of  Representatives\r\n\r\nfrom being held. Once this real issue is understood,\r\n\r\nit is not difficult to understand why they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noppose  this  Bill so strenuously by  advancing  all\r\n\r\nkinds  of  lame excuses and adopting an  obstructive\r\n\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take one instance - the problem of delineating\r\n\r\nboundaries  of Federal Divisions. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\non  the  26th June I sent a letter to all  political\r\n\r\nParties  represented in the Assembly, including  the\r\n\r\ntwo  Independents, calling for suggestions as to how\r\n\r\nthe existing 51 electoral divisions could be grouped\r\n\r\ntogether in threes and fours to form the 15  Federal\r\n\r\nElectoral  Divisions,  in this  matter  of  boundary\r\n\r\ndelineation, the Government would like  to  consider\r\n\r\nthe  views and suggestions of the Opposition Parties\r\n\r\nso  that  a fair proposition could be drawn  up  for\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the various political Parties and the two\r\n\r\nIndependents in their deliberations, a  list  of  51\r\n\r\nconstituencies and the number of voters in each  was\r\n\r\nattached  to the letter. There was no response  from\r\n\r\nthe  various political Parties. In the case  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, I only received a printed copy  of\r\n\r\na  Press  statement in the form of a letter  on  the\r\n\r\nvery  same day of its publication in the Press.  The\r\n\r\nstatement contains nothing constructive except  some\r\n\r\nhollow  and worn-out remarks and a series of puerile\r\n\r\nquestions.  As  it  is desirable that  as  broad  an\r\n\r\nagreement  as possible should be arrived at  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion of electoral boundaries, a further reminder\r\n\r\nwas  sent  on the 8th July, also inviting Opposition\r\n\r\nParties  to  nominate  a representative  each  to  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  of all Parties represented in the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe  U.M.N.O. replied on the 11th July that  it  did\r\n\r\nnot  wish to be represented in the meeting. From the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis I received again  only  a  printed\r\n\r\ncopy of a Press statement in the form of a letter on\r\n\r\nthe same day as it appeared in the Press. Apart from\r\n\r\nrepeating the same diatribe, the statement  contains\r\n\r\nno  proposal regarding delineation of the 15 Federal\r\n\r\nElectoral Divisions. All the other Parties  did  not\r\n\r\nreply  to my letter of 8th July. This goes  to  show\r\n\r\nthat the Barisan Sosialis, the U.P.P. and the S.P.A.\r\n\r\ndo  not  want  elections to  the  Federal  House  of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives  at  this stage.  In  adopting  this\r\n\r\nattitude they could subsequently, if they failed  to\r\n\r\nbe returned to the Parliament, blame the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  of unfair delineation of boundaries  and\r\n\r\nso forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nyesterday was rather pathetic. Gone were his  bounce\r\n\r\nand   confidence,  even  though  they   are   rather\r\n\r\nartificial  at  times. He accused the Government  of\r\n\r\nwanting to hold a snap election. The Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim too makes a similar complaint. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nnot  so  very long ago the Barisan Sosialis and  the\r\n\r\nU.P.P. were hurling challenges after challenges  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to hold elections immediately.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown was bragging and boasting  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  that the masses were with  them  and\r\n\r\nthat they were ready for elections any time. Now, if\r\n\r\nthey  were  in such a state of readiness,  why  this\r\n\r\nfear of snap election now? Is it because the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have suddenly realised that their stock has\r\n\r\ngone  down?  Is  the U.P.P. having  second  thoughts\r\n\r\nafter what has happened to its Havelock Branch? Now,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  wrong  with  a snap election?  It  is  the\r\n\r\nprerogative  of the ruling Party in a  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  to decide when to hold an election.  Snap\r\n\r\nelections  are regularly held in the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nwhere  parliamentary democracy is at its best.  Does\r\n\r\nit  mean  that  in so doing the United  Kingdom  has\r\n\r\nbecome a dictatorial State?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also complained that the\r\n\r\nperiod between the issue of a Writ of Elections  and\r\n\r\nthe  date of the poll is too short for his Party  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  an election campaign. Now, Mr  Speaker.\r\n\r\nSir, he is a bit late in the day to complain of this\r\n\r\nprovision.  The  minimum  period  for  an   election\r\n\r\ncampaign   was   provided  for  in   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly Elections Ordinance and amended\r\n\r\nin  1960  with his support. He did not then consider\r\n\r\nthe  period  too short. So how can he  complain  now\r\n\r\njust  because he has crossed the Floor to the  other\r\n\r\nside and has to fight an election against the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim alleged that one of the\r\n\r\npurposes  of  the  Bill was to provide  for  special\r\n\r\ncounting  procedure  so that the Opposition  Parties\r\n\r\nwould  not  know  of the results  of  each  existing\r\n\r\nSingapore Legislative Assembly Division\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaking  up a Federal Division. Unfortunately he  was\r\n\r\nill  yesterday, and therefore he had  not  heard  my\r\n\r\nspeech  on  this particular point. Incidentally,  it\r\n\r\nseems   a   curious  coincidence  that  his  illness\r\n\r\ncoincided  with the collapse of the U.P.P.  Havelock\r\n\r\nBranch and the resignation of 19 leading members  of\r\n\r\nthat Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said yesterday that this provision is made to\r\n\r\nexpedite the counting of ballot papers and that  the\r\n\r\ncandidate  or  his counting agents  would  know  the\r\n\r\nresult  of each component part making up the Federal\r\n\r\nDivision  although  only the total  results  of  the\r\n\r\nFederal Division would be declared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim also asked how many Work\r\n\r\nBrigade members have been registered as electors  in\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar and Anson. Mr Speaker, Sir,  at  the\r\n\r\nlast  sitting  of  the  Assembly,  in  answer  to  a\r\n\r\nquestion from the Member for the Southern Islands, I\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the Work Brigade members in the  various\r\n\r\ncamps  are  not  required to change their  addresses\r\n\r\nbecause their stay in the camp is temporary and they\r\n\r\nare  liable  to  be transferred from camp  to  camp.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   no   Work  Brigade  member   has   been\r\n\r\ndeliberately asked to change his address in order to\r\n\r\nhave his name in the Electoral Register of Anson  or\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagan. He can be rest assured of this  fact\r\n\r\nshould be desire to contest in Tanjong Pagan against\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody has compelled the Member for Hong Lim to\r\n\r\nchange   his  party  symbol  of  three  interlinking\r\n\r\ncircles,  although it is a well-known fact that  the\r\n\r\ninterlinking  circles  was chosen  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\ndrawing  support by deception from the pro-Communist\r\n\r\nelements  in  the Nanyang University Students  Union\r\n\r\nand  also  from the People's Association which  have\r\n\r\nwon  public support. The U.P.P. was invited to  give\r\n\r\nits   views   on  how  the  boundaries   should   be\r\n\r\ndelineated. It did not reply to my letter nor  offer\r\n\r\nany   proposal  except  to  call  for  an  All-Party\r\n\r\nconference in the Press. When the conference of  all\r\n\r\nPanties represented in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembly  was offered by the Government, the  U.P.P.\r\n\r\nannounced in the Press that it would boycott it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these obstructive attitudes of the Barisan Sosialis and the U.P.P. are not going to help the cause of democracy in any way. It only shows that they are bankrupt of ideas and therefore have no proposals to make. They are only interested in paving the way out by blaming any misfortune of\r\n\r\ntheir Party in any election to the Federal House  of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives on Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the first Malaysian Parliament is convened in Kuala Lumpur soon after Malaysia Day, there must be 15 representatives from Singapore. The question of nominating 15 Members from this Assembly is out. These 15 representatives have to be elected by the people. We cannot wait for\r\n\r\nmonths or years for the Federal Elections Commission\r\n\r\nto  set  up its machinery in Singapore to go through\r\n\r\nthe  process of boundary delineations and so  forth,\r\n\r\nand   deprive  the  people  of  Singapore  of  their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives    in   the   Federal    House    of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives in the meantime. The Bill before the\r\n\r\nHouse is to set out the manner and the procedure  by\r\n\r\nwhich  the  election of 15 Members to the  House  of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives can be held, and nothing  more  than\r\n\r\nthat. It follows the same provision as the Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly Elections  Ordinance  and  the\r\n\r\nobjections of the Opposition have very little to  do\r\n\r\nwith  the  substance of the Bill. The Bill  is  only\r\n\r\nused as a convenient pretext to prevent elections to\r\n\r\nthe House of Representatives from being held. If the\r\n\r\nOpposition defeat this Bill, then they are guilty of\r\n\r\ndepriving   the   people  of  Singapore   of   their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives in the Malaysian Parliament  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  few crucial months of its inception. Whatever\r\n\r\nthe  outcome  of this Bill, Malaysia is  inevitable.\r\n\r\nThere  are only 36 days more to go. There is nothing\r\n\r\nthat  the  combined Opposition can do to prevent  it\r\n\r\nfrom being formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 23; Noes, 23; Paired, 4.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n <pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Ayes.

That limit has now been reached and\r\n\r\nit is sought to increase that limit to $150 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treasury Bills of 91 days' maturity are issued on\r\n\r\ntap to statutory bodies as and when required and are\r\n\r\nalso  offered to the public every month  on  tender.\r\n\r\nTap Bills now carry four per cent interest per annum\r\n\r\nand  Tender Bills average 4.1 per cent interest  per\r\n\r\nannum.  The  amounts outstanding on the issues  are:\r\n\r\nTap  Bills $32.8 million, Tender Bills $17  million,\r\n\r\nbringing the total to $49.8 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year the monthly tenders have been well\r\n\r\nsubscribed.  In the last three months  Tender  Bills\r\n\r\noffered  to  the public have been $6  million  every\r\n\r\nmonth.  Tap  Bills totalling about $9  million  each\r\n\r\ntime  have  been  received. Surplus funds  from  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  bodies can still absorb a large  quantity\r\n\r\nof  Tap  Treasury  Bills.

The\r\n\r\ndealers  should be provided with an ample supply  of\r\n\r\nTreasury  Bills  which will be their main  stock-in-trade.  There  is a large quantity of surplus  funds\r\n\r\nlocally which are available for investment for short\r\n\r\nperiods,  and  if  suitable  outlets  are  found  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  absorb such funds, temporary  surplus\r\n\r\nmonies will be remitted overseas for investment. The\r\n\r\nnew  limit  will improve the Treasury's  ability  to\r\n\r\nborrow  on  the local market and, at the same  time,\r\n\r\nprovide  opportunities for the investment of surplus\r\n\r\nmonies not immediately required\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

The situation still is such  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government continues to deny the workers  their\r\n\r\nlegitimate  rights  of  association,  assembly   and\r\n\r\npublication. As is known, even today, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAssociation   of  Trade  Unions  is   not   as   yet\r\n\r\nregistered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government was elected on a labour\r\n\r\nticket.  They came into office in 1959  on  working-class  votes. We have no doubt that it will go  down\r\n\r\nalso on working-class votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prior to 1959, because the P.A.P. was looked\r\n\r\nupon by the workers and trade unions as a Party that\r\n\r\nrepresented  the will and desire of the workers,  it\r\n\r\nwas  put  into office. But one of the first acts  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  was,  in  fact,  against  organised\r\n\r\nlabour.  Sir, it will be remembered how in 1960  (as\r\n\r\nearly  as  1960), long before there was the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, the Government had used police in the case\r\n\r\nof  workers of the Sassoon Company. It will also  be\r\n\r\nremembered   how  soon  after  the  elections,   the\r\n\r\nallowances  of  civil  servants  were  cut   without\r\n\r\nreference to trade unions. Today, I refer  to  these\r\n\r\ntwo  items, not because we are on this side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  but because we regarded then, as  even  now,\r\n\r\nthe issues to be fundamental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the pay cuts, those of us in the trade unions\r\n\r\nmade our strongest protest against effecting any pay\r\n\r\ncut  without negotiations with the unions concerned.\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Finance is not here tonight. If  he\r\n\r\nremembers  and chooses to be honest, he  will  admit\r\n\r\nthat personal objections were made to the manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich the pay cuts were introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Sassoon strike, the day the police were used\r\n\r\nto  assault  the  strikers, the Secretariat  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Trades  Union Congress  issued  a  public\r\n\r\nstatement   denouncing  the  use  of   the   police.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir, do not let it be misconstrued  that\r\n\r\nit  is  only now that we criticise these acts  which\r\n\r\nwere by any standard anti-union and anti-labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1961, the Government's use of State machinery\r\n\r\nagainst   trade   unions  which  were   not   P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncontrolled  increased and we found that  the  police\r\n\r\nwere  being  used against strikers of  unions  which\r\n\r\nwere  not  P.A.P. unions. The police  were  used  to\r\n\r\nbreak  strikes. We found pressure was being  applied\r\n\r\non  employers  to  prevent  them  from  coming  into\r\n\r\nagreements  with  unions which  were  non-P.A.P.  We\r\n\r\nfound the Labour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry,   particularly   the   office    of    the\r\n\r\nCommissioner   for  Labour,  was   being   used   to\r\n\r\ndiscriminate  against unions which were  not  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncontrolled.  The  office of the Registrar  of  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  was also being used to disturb trade  unions\r\n\r\nwhich were not P.A.P. controlled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on numerous occasions, we have quoted in this\r\n\r\nHouse  examples of the blatant abuse of State power.\r\n\r\nI  would like to just recall one or two examples and\r\n\r\nI do not wish to go into many of the statements that\r\n\r\nwe have repeated here and outside the House. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to take one case first. It is the case of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Plywood,  where  the  Government  clearly\r\n\r\nattempted  to  apply  pressure on  the  employer  to\r\n\r\nrefuse  implementation of the terms of agreement.  A\r\n\r\ncollective   agreement  was   signed   between   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  General Employees' Union and the  Plywood\r\n\r\nmanagement.  It was agreed that the bonus,  an  item\r\n\r\ncontained in the agreement, he implemented the  next\r\n\r\nday,  the  day  after the signing. The Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the  Minister  for  Labour  and   the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Finance  intervened  and  told   the\r\n\r\nemployer not to pay the bonus, to enable the  Manual\r\n\r\nand  Mercantile  Workers' Union to  make  propaganda\r\n\r\nthat  the Singapore General Employees' Union  was  a\r\n\r\nuseless  union, that having signed an agreement,  it\r\n\r\ncould not get the employer to implement the terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is one example I quoted. There have been\r\n\r\nmany  other  examples where Government pressure  had\r\n\r\nbeen put on employers to refuse dealings with unions\r\n\r\nthat  were  non-P.A.P.,  to refuse  the  rights  and\r\n\r\nprivileges of unions which were non-P.A.P.,  and  to\r\n\r\nrefuse implementation of the terms of agreements.  I\r\n\r\nmentioned the Plywood case in particular because  in\r\n\r\nthis  case,  we  had  conclusive evidence  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister himself had called up certain officials  of\r\n\r\nthe  company  and  told them that if  they  did  not\r\n\r\nfollow  Government instructions, their  permits  for\r\n\r\nstaying  in  Singapore would be withdrawn  and  they\r\n\r\nwould  be sent back to where they came from. In  the\r\n\r\ncourse of the Arbitration Court hearing on the  case\r\n\r\nof Plywood, I did say that the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad used his powers to prevent the implementation of\r\n\r\nterms of a collective agreement that had been agreed\r\n\r\nbetween the union and the employer. The Minister did\r\n\r\nnot  deny  this.  The Government  had  no  statement\r\n\r\nissued and they did not deny it. Because if they had\r\n\r\ndenied  it  then,  that  would  have  given  us   an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to produce evidence in the  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt to show how and when and who had intervened to\r\n\r\nprevent the implementation of the terms. Sir,  that\r\n\r\nis one example of pressure on an employer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of the abuse of the powers of the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for Labour. Sir, in the  case  of  the\r\n\r\nTiger  Breweries  and  the  Anchor  Breweries,   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for  Labour ordered  a  secret  ballot\r\n\r\nwhich,  in  our view, was contrary to the provisions\r\n\r\nof the Industrial Relations Ordinance. He ordered  a\r\n\r\nsecret  ballot  to  include a  certain  category  of\r\n\r\nworkers who were not involved in the claims made  by\r\n\r\nthe  `Singapore  General Employees' Union.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to say here that this was a case similar to the\r\n\r\none  that  the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees\r\n\r\nhad  recently  with the Government  in  relation  to\r\n\r\ntrade  union representation. I do not know for  what\r\n\r\nreason  they  did not proceed with the balloting  as\r\n\r\nthey  had  planned. But in the case of  the  General\r\n\r\nEmployees'  Union involving the Brewery  workers,  a\r\n\r\nballot  was proceeded with. Perhaps, Sir,  officials\r\n\r\nof  the Singapore General Employees' Union were  not\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members, unlike officials of the Amalgamated\r\n\r\nUnion of Public Employees -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

It is fantastic,  it  is\r\n\r\nunbelievable, that there should be responsible civil\r\n\r\nservants   who,   as  the  Minister   for   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment has informed us, come from two  separate\r\n\r\nGovernment   Departments,  who  should  have   given\r\n\r\npermission  for  the erection and  display  of  this\r\n\r\ncommercial  monument  that at night  transforms  the\r\n\r\nlovely  Cathedral and its grounds literally  into  a\r\n\r\nred  light  area,  amid  in the  day  and  night  it\r\n\r\ndestroys  the harmony of the very centre  of  public\r\n\r\nbuildings of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to say here that I have received\r\n\r\ninformation  whose reliability I am not prepared  to\r\n\r\nvouch  for,  but it is important that it  should  be\r\n\r\nknown  even though it may just be a rumour - that  it\r\n\r\nis  alleged that the civil servants from  these  two\r\n\r\ndepartments  refused  to give  permission  for  this\r\n\r\ninsult  to  our City, and that it was pressure  from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance that compelled  them  to\r\n\r\nconcede and to grant the necessary licences. Whether\r\n\r\nthat information be true or not, I consider that the\r\n\r\ngranting  of licences for so patently monstrous  and\r\n\r\ndisfiguring a commercial monument, destructive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the harmony of our main public centre, requires a\r\n\r\npublic  inquiry,  and  those responsible  should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered    incapable   of    discharging    their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, I do not know if you remember, but I raised this matter at Question Time on the 11th of June. There was one interjection by the Member for Cairnhill, right at the very end, which quite startled me at the time and over which I have pondered since. It Consisted of one word, Sir, at\r\n\r\nthe   very   end   of  the  Minister  for   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment's reply. That one word was \"A-no-ne\". A-no-ne,  Sir, is a Japanese word known to  all  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  suffered during the Occupation  and  even\r\n\r\nthose  who have played footsy with them and profited\r\n\r\nin being in their employ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has since occurred to me, Mr Mammen, that\r\n\r\nwhereas   I   was  and  am  viewing  this  monstrous\r\n\r\ncommercial advertising monument as a leprous blot on\r\n\r\nthe  fair face of Singapore, others in Singapore are\r\n\r\nviewing it as an act of national arrogance. At  this\r\n\r\njuncture, I think I should make it clear that I was,\r\n\r\nat the material time, responsible for permitting and\r\n\r\nencouraging  re-entry  into  Singapore  of  Japanese\r\n\r\nmerchants  and  Japanese  banking  after   the   re-occupation, because I was convinced, as I am  today,\r\n\r\nthat  Japan,  being  one of the foremost  democratic\r\n\r\nnations  in  Asia, it is important  that  we  should\r\n\r\nextend  to  her  all our goowill and any  assistance\r\n\r\nthat in our way we can give. I think it important to\r\n\r\nsay  this, Sir, in case there is any suggestion that\r\n\r\nthere  is bias on my part, because I wish it  to  be\r\n\r\nrecognised  that conduct of the kind  epitomised  in\r\n\r\nthis  monstrous monument creates strong  resentment,\r\n\r\nnot   merely   directly  towards  those  immediately\r\n\r\nresponsible  but  spilling  into  wider   and   more\r\n\r\ndangerous areas. This \"National\" monument, insulting\r\n\r\nin  its size and situation and insolent in its name,\r\n\r\nepitomises   Japanese  commercial   arrogance.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment's interest in permitting this  insult  to\r\n\r\nthe  City of Singapore requires explanation, for  no\r\n\r\nman  in  his  senses,  barring a  blind  man,  could\r\n\r\ntolerate    the   creation   of   this   disfiguring\r\n\r\nmonstrosity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  very centre of our public institutions.  If\r\n\r\nsuch  a  sign were erected in front of the  Imperial\r\n\r\nPalace  in Tokyo, there would be a riot. The  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore are docile, fortunately. But I  think,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  it  is,  and  it should  be  recognised,\r\n\r\nnecessary  that this Government with its very  short\r\n\r\nlife - if it is capable of any decent act, and if  it\r\n\r\nis   not  guilty  of  ministerial  interference   in\r\n\r\nexecutive conduct and the alleged compulsion brought\r\n\r\nto bear upon civil servants to give licences - should\r\n\r\nappoint a Commission of Inquiry to ascertain how and\r\n\r\nwhy  this monstrosity comes to disfigure this island\r\n\r\nof  ours, and they should furthermore give notice to\r\n\r\nthe  organisation immediately responsible  for  this\r\n\r\ncommercial insult to our city that the licences  for\r\n\r\nthe display will be terminated when they rust out at\r\n\r\nthe end of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also take the liberty, Mr Mammen, Sir, to\r\n\r\nsuggest to the Japanese mercantile community that it\r\n\r\nwould  be  wiser  in  the  long  run  in  their  own\r\n\r\ninterests  to  see that a monument of ths  character\r\n\r\nand this arrogance should not continue to insult and\r\n\r\nantagonise our citizens.

Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nactually know how this disgrace to our landscape -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - this disfigurement to our city\r\n\r\nsilhouette can get through the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there might be many reasons. One of the possible reasons, as the Member for Anson has said, may be that the Minister for Finance over-ruled the decision of civil servants. That reason is possible because I always have doubt, for instance, as to why the Government dare not\r\n\r\npress   on  with  the  claim  against  the  Japanese\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  compensation. Was  it  because  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Ministers  were scared of the  Japanese  not\r\n\r\ncoming  to Singapore for further investment? Or  was\r\n\r\nit  because some of the P.A.P. Ministers had  during\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese  occupation worked for  the  Japanese?\r\n\r\nThat  we  would not know. Anyway, I agree  with  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  that we  must  probe  into  this\r\n\r\ndisgrace to our city, how it came to pass, and  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government should give us full details  of  how\r\n\r\nthis monument was actually approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, the \"National\" advertising tower  is\r\n\r\na great insult to the people of Singapore. We do not\r\n\r\nknow  why  the Government approved the  erection  of\r\n\r\nthis  advertising tower. Does the erection  of  this\r\n\r\ntower  mean  that  the  Government  approve  of  the\r\n\r\nJapanese massacre of our people in the Second  World\r\n\r\nWar?   Civic   organisations  here   have   demanded\r\n\r\ncompensation  for the victims of the  massacre,  but\r\n\r\nthe  Government have not taken the issue  seriously,\r\n\r\nbut  instead  are adopting delaying tactics  and  so\r\n\r\nhave annoyed the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that this advertising tower has\r\n\r\na  red  background. Thousands of people in Singapore\r\n\r\nwere massacred by the Japanese troops, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis debt cannot be cleared. And this tower by using\r\n\r\nred  as  the background symbolises the blood of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, and indirectly it insults  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. Therefore, we suggest that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should order the company to pull down the\r\n\r\ntower  and press the Japanese to compensate for  the\r\n\r\nmassacre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Sir, during his speech the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nmentioned  certain information that he had  received - that   according  to  his  understanding   of   his\r\n\r\ninformation,  the  Chief  Planner  and   the   Chief\r\n\r\nBuilding Surveyor had, in fact, refused the erection\r\n\r\nof  this  tower  but were pressured by  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  to agree to it. Sir, according to  what  I\r\n\r\nunderstand,  this  is  very  far  from  true.  As  I\r\n\r\nanswered the Member for Anson sometime ago  on  this\r\n\r\nquestion  of the \"National\" sign along North  Bridge\r\n\r\nRoad,  I  informed the Member that the  approval  of\r\n\r\nthis sky-sign was given by the Planning Authority as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the Chief Surveyor's Department.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  further  inform him that  before  planning\r\n\r\npermission  was  granted to the proposed  structure,\r\n\r\nthis  proposal was also referred to the  Development\r\n\r\nControl  Committee, whose members include the  Chief\r\n\r\nPlanner,  the  Director of Public Works,  the  Chief\r\n\r\nBuilding Surveyor, and a representative each of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Institute of Architects and  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nSociety  of  Engineers.  This Committee  considered,\r\n\r\namongst other factors, the aspects of this proposal,\r\n\r\nand  was able to advise approval, subject to certain\r\n\r\nimprovements  being  made  to  the  design  of   the\r\n\r\nstructure,  which were duly complied  with.  Whether\r\n\r\nthis    particular   structure   is    aesthetically\r\n\r\nobjectionable is a matter of opinion.  I  might  add\r\n\r\nthat in any big cities such as ours, advertising sky-signs  are an accepted feature of the city sky-line.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  at  this moment, there are 121  sky-signs\r\n\r\nerected in Singapore, and it is odd that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson,  the Member for Hong Lim  and  even  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Pasir Panjang should object to only  one\r\n\r\nof the -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> But not of that size, nor of that\r\n\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, as regards size, I would like\r\n\r\nto inform the Member for Anson that there is also  a\r\n\r\nPan-American  Airlines sky-sign which is  very  much\r\n\r\nhigher  than  this  sky-sign,  but  he  has  got  no\r\n\r\nobjection to it.
