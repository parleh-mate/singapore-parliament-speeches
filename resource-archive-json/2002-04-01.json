In his Address  at  the\r\n\r\nOpening  of  the  First  Session  of  this  Parliament,   the\r\n\r\nPresident   has  elaborated  on  the  challenges  confronting\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I would like to relate these challenges to what I\r\n\r\nsee  as the three wake-up calls at the individual Singaporean\r\n\r\nlevel.   I  shall  begin with the one  that  is  ringing  the\r\n\r\nloudest and most incessantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Wake-up Call Number 1</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we thought were unshakeable areas of competitive\r\n\r\nadvantage that Singapore has are now vulnerable, and this  is\r\n\r\nlargely due to a confluence of several factors:  firstly, the\r\n\r\nglobal  slowdown led by the US economy; secondly, challenging\r\n\r\nregional  economic  and political conditions;  and,  thirdly,\r\n\r\nincreasing competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a regional hub, Singapore will face intensifying\r\n\r\nrisks of losing key parts of the critical mass.  I would like\r\n\r\nnow  to discuss this against a backdrop of shifts in economic\r\n\r\ngrowth concentration and investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, economists are projecting that economic growth in\r\n\r\nour  immediate region of around 3-4% for each of the next two\r\n\r\nyears will be overshadowed by the North Asian region, led  by\r\n\r\na potential 7-8% growth in the huge China market.  If we were\r\n\r\nto  consider  this concentration on an even wider perspective\r\n\r\nand  think  GNP  rather than GDP, then China's reach  extends\r\n\r\neven further.  China has taken a strategic decision to invest\r\n\r\nabroad  for a variety of reasons, including plans  to  secure\r\n\r\nnew  supplies  of natural resources.  According  to  the  Far\r\n\r\nEastern  Economic  Review, Chinese state-owned  offshore  oil\r\n\r\ncompany,  CNOOC  (China National Off-Shore Oil  Corporation),\r\n\r\nplonked  US$585  million  for some  Indonesian  oil  and  gas\r\n\r\nassets.   In Australia itself, Chinese investment,  primarily\r\n\r\nin iron ore and aluminium businesses, stood at US$1.2 billion\r\n\r\nat last count.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, long-range planes, when available, or huge\r\n\r\nshipping  alliances, may not need to call  at  Singapore,  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  business  reason  to  do  so.   Therefore,  an\r\n\r\nexcellent Changi Airport or a successful PSA alone  will  not\r\n\r\nget  us  very  far.  Likewise, our stronghold on  derivatives\r\n\r\ntrading in the region will constantly be challenged unless we\r\n\r\ngive reasons to traders to always use us, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to move on to the twin effects of\r\n\r\ntechnology and globalisation on competition itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, globalisation itself is already increasing\r\n\r\ncompetition,  and  technology is  accelerating  the  pace  of\r\n\r\nglobalisation.  So businesses are now growing slowly,  if  at\r\n\r\nall, and only if they adapt.  Businesses cannot sit still and\r\n\r\nlet  uncomfortable trends destroy them.  Not to  react  would\r\n\r\nonly mean they die out.  Businesses really have no choice but\r\n\r\nto react ruthlessly, and this would come in many forms, eg,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndownsizing  in  response to a dip in demand, very  much  like\r\n\r\nwhat we have seen in the travel business in the aftermath  of\r\n\r\nSeptember 11 (911); secondly, relocating lower-end production\r\n\r\nout  of Singapore; thirdly, bringing in talent from elsewhere\r\n\r\nto  keep  the business going; fourthly, merging for  critical\r\n\r\nmass,  such  as that we have seen in the banks;  or  fifthly,\r\n\r\neven getting out of certain businesses altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these factors have an impact at the individual\r\n\r\nlevel.  Whilst retrenchment at the personal level is painful,\r\n\r\nit  would  be  better to accept such restructuring  as  harsh\r\n\r\nrealities  than  to hope that something can be  done  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to  these  seemingly  unsympathetic   banks   or\r\n\r\nungrateful large companies.  Even if our jobs were intact, we\r\n\r\nwould  have to accept that we would probably have to do more,\r\n\r\nlearn  new  skills  and  adjust to  new  working  conditions,\r\n\r\nperhaps all at the same time.  For those of us who have  been\r\n\r\nretrenched, new employment would be difficult to come by  and\r\n\r\nwould most likely mean taking a lower pay and position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the individual level, self-esteem will go down\r\n\r\nand  this  is  where the moral support of the family  or  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  can  be  extremely helpful.  There  are  anecdotal\r\n\r\nsigns that more marriages come under stress when one partner,\r\n\r\nespecially the breadwinner, loses his job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are some of the hopes we can hold on to and\r\n\r\nthose that we should inject a sense of reality?  Sir, we  can\r\n\r\ncertainly  cling onto the assurance that the Government  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  devote plenty of resources to developing  human\r\n\r\ncapital  to  the  whole  spectrum of pre-school  to  tertiary\r\n\r\neducation, for skills upgrading, re-skilling and job-matching\r\n\r\nwhilst  ensuring  at  the same time  that  we  anchor  enough\r\n\r\neconomic  activity in and from Singapore into the  global  or\r\n\r\nregional  market.  As long as we are proactive and receptive,\r\n\r\nwe  will be able to receive help on adapting to changing  job\r\n\r\nand market demands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, we would also have to manage our wage\r\n\r\nexpectations.  For the past decade, our wage growth has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naveraged more than 7% in nominal terms and about 5%  in  real\r\n\r\nterms.  This will no longer be a sure thing, which means that\r\n\r\nwe  can no longer use this assumption to make investments  or\r\n\r\nconsume the way we could have in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, there will also be a change in the\r\n\r\nemployer-employee  relationship.  We now  have  less  control\r\n\r\nover our working lives and loyalties to companies will weaken\r\n\r\nas  we  realise that companies can no longer be paternalistic\r\n\r\nand avoid laying off workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a nutshell, this wake-up call is all about\r\n\r\nchange,  and having to cope with a more rapid pace of change,\r\n\r\nmuch  of  which is uncomfortable.  Most of the jobs that  are\r\n\r\nlost  are gone forever so we should not hold out for a US-led\r\n\r\nrecovery and for a return of the same old jobs.  Instead,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  continually make ourselves relevant  and  think  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  our  skills, ie, what we can  do  and  contribute,\r\n\r\nrather than the jobs we would like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Wake-up Call Number 2</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Singaporeans have to work towards preserving our\r\n\r\nracial  and religious harmony, that harmony will not continue\r\n\r\nas  a matter of course, and that external events and stresses\r\n\r\ncan  attack  our harmony.  Until the infamous  911  terrorist\r\n\r\nattacks  in  the US, the war in Afghanistan, the fighting  in\r\n\r\nthe  West Bank and some other events, we did not realise that\r\n\r\nwe  need  to  pay attention to our own racial  and  religious\r\n\r\nharmony.  Now, Sir, we realise that these external events can\r\n\r\nsurface or resurface old issues stemming from differences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wake-up call can cut both ways. If we allow it,\r\n\r\nexternal stresses can undo whatever precious harmony we  have\r\n\r\nbuilt  up,  or  we  can  become even more  conscious  of  the\r\n\r\ndifferences   between  races  and  religions  and   seek   to\r\n\r\nproactively integrate and understand even more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have come a long way in fostering inter-racial\r\n\r\nand  inter-religious ties.  As a small country, we  can  ill-afford\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto let external events and external influences exert pressure\r\n\r\non us.  In a nutshell, we must jealously guard our racial and\r\n\r\nreligious harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Wake-up Call Number 3</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wake-up call, which probably takes on a more subtle\r\n\r\nand dull tone, is that we Singaporeans have to take ownership\r\n\r\nof  our  future and strengthen our sense of belonging to  the\r\n\r\ncountry and to one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need to bond even closer to increase our\r\n\r\nsurvival as a small nation with no natural resources.   There\r\n\r\nis  also  a  need to give the Government full moral authority\r\n\r\nand support so as to bring about the much-needed wide-ranging\r\n\r\nand transformational changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of ownership to Singapore and one another is\r\n\r\nall  the  more important because of our aging population  and\r\n\r\nthe  need  to help fellow Singaporeans cope with the digital,\r\n\r\ninformation and wealth divide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the key really is, how do we react to these three\r\n\r\nwake-up calls?  Do we break out in cold sweat or have we been\r\n\r\ntossing and turning and dreading the wake-up call, or  do  we\r\n\r\narise and take these changes in our stride?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we break out in cold sweat, we should check why we\r\n\r\nhave  fears and concerns and how we can address them.  If  we\r\n\r\nhave  just  lost  a job that we have had for the  past  15-20\r\n\r\nyears,  then we can try examining what skills and  experience\r\n\r\nwe  have  accumulated and seek to apply these skills to  jobs\r\n\r\noutside  of the natural industry.  If we now shudder  at  how\r\n\r\ninsecure   our  surroundings  have  become,  no   thanks   to\r\n\r\nterrorism,  then  we  should discuss  with  our  friends  and\r\n\r\ncommunity how we can look out for each other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we have been tossing and turning, and\r\n\r\ndreading  the  calls, then we should no longer wait  for  the\r\n\r\nseemingly  inevitable events to happen.  Instead,  we  should\r\n\r\nactively  look for alternatives and explore opportunities  to\r\n\r\nlearn new skills for other jobs.  We should also not allow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nisolated  incidents of inter-racial discord  to  fester.   We\r\n\r\nshould  actively reach out to friends and fellow Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto gain a better understanding and build common ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all, if we have been alerted to these challenges,\r\n\r\nwe  can  then take all these in our stride - assess  what  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  do  and  how we can respond to yet another  set  of\r\n\r\nchallenges or changing circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by observing that we have\r\n\r\na  lot  going  for us.  We have huge savings as a  nation,  a\r\n\r\nsound  financial  and  physical  infrastructure,  substantial\r\n\r\ngoodwill from the Singapore branding - in terms of integrity,\r\n\r\ntransparency   and  an  excellent  workforce   -   and   most\r\n\r\nimportantly, political and economic stability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can therefore embrace the changes to policy and\r\n\r\nstrategies  that  the Government will have  to  painstakingly\r\n\r\nundertake  and  be  receptive  to  the  need  for  a  change,\r\n\r\nespecially at the personal level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that Singaporeans are a pragmatic and\r\n\r\nsensible lot and the resounding mandate of 75% at the last GE\r\n\r\nreflects, firstly, a common destiny and appreciation for  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  survival in challenging times and,  secondly,  the\r\n\r\ntrust the Singaporeans have in the PAP Government to take  us\r\n\r\nthrough  the necessary transformations, and to help  us  cope\r\n\r\nwith change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise  to speak in support of the Motion  of  Thanks,\r\n\r\nmoved  by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, to the President for his  Address\r\n\r\nin  this  House  a week ago.  Before that,  may  I  offer  my\r\n\r\ncongratulations to you and the newly elected Deputy Speakers.\r\n\r\nI  am sure that the high standards of decorum and dignity  in\r\n\r\nParliamentary  debate  set by your distinguished  predecessor\r\n\r\nwill be continued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, observers might have remarked before that\r\n\r\nproceedings in this House\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  conducted in a tame, even somnambulistic manner.  There\r\n\r\nmight  have been some video evidence of this after  we  moved\r\n\r\ninto  this  House, where no corner of this  Chamber  is  left\r\n\r\nuncovered  by  a  TV  camera or from the sharp  eyes  of  the\r\n\r\nreporters above us.  I say this now as a victim of  the  all-seeing electronic eyes, so that our new colleagues would not,\r\n\r\nwell, be caught napping.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure that we will be entirely rid of soporific\r\n\r\nspeeches in this Tenth Parliament, but let us hope that  with\r\n\r\nthe  measures announced to \"liven\" up debates in this  House,\r\n\r\nsuch  speeches would be in shorter supply.  Lest I be accused\r\n\r\nof  inducing  sleep,  may I say at once that  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nmeasures announced recently would go some way to help  foster\r\n\r\nmore lively debates, but the effectiveness of them remains to\r\n\r\nbe  seen.   How  willing will Ministers  and  others  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  accept the challenge to re-examine  policies  and\r\n\r\nlegislation, how often will they accept suggestions to set up\r\n\r\nSelect  Committees  to  examine the language  and  impact  of\r\n\r\nproposed  legislation,  how willing are  they  to  engage  in\r\n\r\ndebate, and even concede to a winning argument - we will have\r\n\r\nto  wait  and  see.  Indeed, Sir, I think there is  one  more\r\n\r\nthing  worth  emphasising - and that is, there  should  be  a\r\n\r\nsignal  from  political leaders that our civil servants,  the\r\n\r\nones dealing with the everyday running of the country, should\r\n\r\nalso listen and may I say, more frequently, listen with their\r\n\r\nhearts rather than applying policies and rules blindly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the truth be told, in fact, the man-in-the-street sees the Government in its most elemental form through\r\n\r\nthe  actions of civil servants and other public officials  he\r\n\r\ndeals  with, and not through the comparatively rare occasions\r\n\r\nwhen  he actually listens to a speech by a Minister or  other\r\n\r\npolitical  leader.  If the public were to have confidence  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government, it would be through how responsive the civil\r\n\r\nservants  or public officials are to their problems,  whether\r\n\r\nit   be  their  summonses  for  traffic  offences,  or  their\r\n\r\nutilities  bills  or their HDB problems or  their  children's\r\n\r\nschooling problems.  Too often, we have seen replies that are\r\n\r\nhardly helpful and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  response  is  very frequently in  terms  of  a  negative\r\n\r\ndecision,  without any reason being given.   The  citizen  is\r\n\r\nleft  in the dark to contemplate his next move, which  is  to\r\n\r\nsee  the  MP,  who is also in the dark, as he is seldom  told\r\n\r\nmore  than what is told to the citizen.  This gives  rise  to\r\n\r\nfurther  appeals  and  further  letters  of  rejection   from\r\n\r\nofficers  who  follow  policies laid down  without  question.\r\n\r\nSometimes,  I  wonder  whether  any  GLC  has  a  controlling\r\n\r\ninterest in the paper industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there would be a quantum leap in confidence\r\n\r\nbuilding  if we can have public officials who take the  extra\r\n\r\nstep  to  view  such  appeals as appeals from  an  individual\r\n\r\nrather than from a class.  We want civil servants in this new\r\n\r\nera who do not take comfort in the uniformity of replies.  We\r\n\r\nwant  public  officials who can think.  We  also  want  civil\r\n\r\nservants who can feel - civil servants whose hearts  are  not\r\n\r\nleft  at  home when they go to work every day.  To  borrow  a\r\n\r\nphrase from American Express, never leave home without it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate with an example from HDB. (I should\r\n\r\nstate at the outset that I admire HDB's comprehensive replies\r\n\r\nto  residents on every conceivable problem that might  arise.\r\n\r\nI  am  only using this illustration because many Members must\r\n\r\nhave  faced this problem.)  I refer to the treatment of cases\r\n\r\nwhere the owner in the recession that we are facing now wants\r\n\r\nto  change  down from his original choice of flat because  he\r\n\r\ncan  no longer afford it as he had lost his job and means  of\r\n\r\nsupport.  The stock answer is that if you have not stayed  in\r\n\r\nthe  flat  for five years, you cannot sell, whether  you  can\r\n\r\nafford to pay for it or not.  If there is a genuine case,  if\r\n\r\nsomeone  has been retrenched and is making a painful decision\r\n\r\nto change down, why do we prolong his agony?  Sir, the way to\r\n\r\nfoster meaningful relationships between Government and people\r\n\r\nis  to  allow  the official to take the extra  step,  without\r\n\r\nadverse  consequences  to  himself or  herself,  to  question\r\n\r\npolicies  and  to  see whether a reasonable solution  can  be\r\n\r\nreached,  whether an exception to a policy can be  justified.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we will have a civil service that is recognised as\r\n\r\nbeing  super  efficient, but which remains out of  sync  with\r\n\r\nthose whom they serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's Address contains much to think\r\n\r\nabout  and  to debate on.  Its key message seems to  be  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  must  \"remake\"  itself  to  face  tougher   global\r\n\r\ncompetition  and  global terrorism.  Economic  restructuring,\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion and political renewal - these are the themes\r\n\r\nthat  will  matter  in  the  remaking  of  Singapore.   Quite\r\n\r\nfrankly,  the themes are the same as those in the  making  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  since independence.  What is different is  in  the\r\n\r\nways and means in which we seek to \"remake\" Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree more that entrepreneurship and risk-taking must be encouraged, and that our young people must\r\n\r\nhave  a  more inquiring and adventurous spirit.  But I cannot\r\n\r\nagree,  as stated in the President's Address that \"developing\r\n\r\narts,  sports and a stronger civic society\" would be part  of\r\n\r\nthe  process  to  bring this about, as  if  developing  arts,\r\n\r\nsports  and  a stronger civic society is a means to  bringing\r\n\r\nabout   entreprenuership.   I  should   have   thought   that\r\n\r\ndeveloping arts, sports and a stronger civic society are ends\r\n\r\nin themselves, not as a means to foster entrepreneurship.   I\r\n\r\nam  not  sure  that  the  founder  of  Creative  Technologies\r\n\r\nindulgently  sees himself as an artist, poet or writer.   And\r\n\r\nthe  Sound Blaster card, we are sure, does not write music  - it merely reproduces it, or more accurately, blasts it out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, literature, poetry, arts, music - these are the\r\n\r\nthings  that define the culture of a nation, the  soul  of  a\r\n\r\nnation.   They should be encouraged so that Singaporeans  can\r\n\r\nsee themselves in prose, in poetry, in art or in music.  They\r\n\r\nadd  to the uniqueness of being Singaporean. As for sportsmen\r\n\r\nand  women  who  excel  and do Singapore  proud  in  schools,\r\n\r\nconstituency,  national or international  competitions,  they\r\n\r\nare  to  be  valued  for  their  sporting  achievements,  and\r\n\r\nhopefully   not   for   their   entrepreneurship   potential.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  draw  together to salute  such  achievers.   If\r\n\r\nanything, they help promote national pride and solidarity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must adopt the development of the arts and sports as\r\n\r\nprimary aims, and not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  secondary aims to promote entrepreneurship.   I  want  to\r\n\r\nemphasise this in case an argument is made that certain types\r\n\r\nof art or music have no economic or entrepreneurial value and\r\n\r\ntherefore  should  not be encouraged or supported.   We  must\r\n\r\navoid  this  type of thinking.  I am sure that  some  Members\r\n\r\nwill  return  to this theme in the next few days  or  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget debates to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Address rightly refers to the widening income\r\n\r\ngap between those who are able and willing to embrace the new\r\n\r\ntechnologies  and those who are not.  We are  already  in  an\r\n\r\neconomic  recession - and many Singaporeans  have  faced  the\r\n\r\ntraumatic experience of being out of a job.  With a family to\r\n\r\nfeed,  and  no job on the horizon, it takes a lot  out  of  a\r\n\r\nperson.   Many Members of this House would have had  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  many jobless persons - you can see the despair and  the\r\n\r\nfrustration. They have lost their dignity - and they  do  not\r\n\r\nwant pity.  They accept but are not satisfied with an interim\r\n\r\ngrant  to  them to tide things over.  They just want  a  job.\r\n\r\nBeing jobless affects not just one's income, but one's belief\r\n\r\nin  oneself  -  and  above all, the family's  belief  in  his\r\n\r\nability to provide for their basic needs and happiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Address signals the Government's\r\n\r\ndetermination  to  tackle  this problem.   Job  creation  and\r\n\r\nretraining of our workforce remain top priorities for the new\r\n\r\nGovernment.   But, one particularly difficult  problem  which\r\n\r\nhitherto  still remains unresolved is how do we  provide  for\r\n\r\nthe  increasing  group  of jobless  workers  who  are  either\r\n\r\nunwilling or unable to retrain or find jobs.  The problem  is\r\n\r\nparticularly  acute for those around 50 years old.  Who  will\r\n\r\nprovide  for  them?  Very often, for those about  50  or  so,\r\n\r\ncompanies  do  not  want  them  even  after  they  have  been\r\n\r\nretrained.   I believe that this problem needs to be  tackled\r\n\r\nimmediately.  Do we need regulation or legislation to make it\r\n\r\nunlawful  for  employers who refuse to hire on the  basis  of\r\n\r\nage,  if  the  applicant  otherwise  has  all  the  necessary\r\n\r\nqualifications?  I know that we do not want to put  too  many\r\n\r\nbarriers for employers - but on occasions, some are justified\r\n\r\nso that we can forestall a serious social problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we move from the economic to the political, one\r\n\r\nof  the  most  positive  statements in  the  Address  is  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  the  Government to \"widen  the  out-of-bounds\"\r\n\r\nmarkers for political engagement and debate, not just in this\r\n\r\nHouse,  but generally in Singapore.  We must once again  wait\r\n\r\nand  see  how  these  OB markers will be  defined.   What  is\r\n\r\ninteresting too is how this intention is read by the  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration.   I asked my daughter who recently  finished  her\r\n\r\nJunior  College  studies how she and her friends  would  view\r\n\r\nthis increase in freedom.  Her answer in a way surprised  me.\r\n\r\nShe  said  that some feel (I suppose including herself)  that\r\n\r\nthe  intention is not quite genuine.  Somehow they feel  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will  still control  the  exercise  of  such\r\n\r\nfreedoms and will only pretend to listen.  We must take steps\r\n\r\nto  remove such doubts and cynicism among the young people in\r\n\r\nSingapore  -  indeed, among all Singaporeans,  otherwise  the\r\n\r\nproblem will remain unresolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that care must be taken in this move\r\n\r\ntowards   greater  opportunity  for  the  people  to  express\r\n\r\nthemselves.  We do not want a situation where the expressions\r\n\r\nof  individual  opinions turn into a claim  for  rights,  and\r\n\r\nwhere legal action is always contemplated.  I know many young\r\n\r\npeople,  especially those familiar with the law, look towards\r\n\r\nwell-developed countries such as the US or the UK and  bemoan\r\n\r\nthe  fact that we do not have an administrative law structure\r\n\r\nthat   allows  individuals  to  challenge  public   servants'\r\n\r\ndecisions on a myriad of matters.  But in this, my opinion is\r\n\r\nthat  we should be careful about putting such decisions  onto\r\n\r\nthe  legal  plane for it takes away the discretion  from  the\r\n\r\npeople  who can resolve the matters without going through  an\r\n\r\nelaborate  legal process.  The truth is, so long as  we  have\r\n\r\nwise  leadership, willing to listen and to take into  account\r\n\r\nindividual  circumstances in the special case, we  should  be\r\n\r\nable to \"remake\" Singapore, not in anybody else's image,  but\r\n\r\none that is uniquely our own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be confidence in all Singaporeans that they\r\n\r\nwill be listened to.  But all Singaporeans must also exercise\r\n\r\ntheir  freedoms  reasonably and  responsibly.   It  must  not\r\n\r\ndegenerate into a series\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof   demands  based  on  self-interest.   We  must  have  and\r\n\r\ncultivate a politically sophisticated population - willing to\r\n\r\nsee  and understand the wider picture even if it impinges  on\r\n\r\ntheir  own interests.  Then, and only then, can the Singapore\r\n\r\nheart-beat be heard to beat as one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion of thanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  support the motion standing in the name of Mrs  Lim  Hwee\r\n\r\nHua.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant events of last year and especially\r\n\r\nSeptember  11,  2001 showed us that times have  changed,  and\r\n\r\nchanging ever so dramatically.  Globalisation which was  just\r\n\r\na   concept   not  too  long  ago  has  become   a   reality.\r\n\r\nTransformations are taking place on the global scale that  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  change our perspective in the way we  do  business,\r\n\r\nwork and live.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In globalisation, local happenings are shaped by events\r\n\r\noccurring  many  miles away.  The terrorist  attacks  of  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Trade  Centre  Twin Towers in New  York  have  brought\r\n\r\nthreats  to  our door-step in Singapore.  It is a frightening\r\n\r\nrevelation  that  even  terrorism  has  taken  on  a   global\r\n\r\nperspective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation offers us both challenges and\r\n\r\nopportunities.   For a small country with  a  small  domestic\r\n\r\nmarket,  globalisation  provides  us  with  opportunities  of\r\n\r\nlarger markets.  It also means stiffer competition from  more\r\n\r\ncountries competing against us, especially for foreign direct\r\n\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen what happened during the 1997 Asian\r\n\r\nFinancial  Crisis and the staggering impact on  the  regional\r\n\r\nfinancial  markets.  Thomas Friedman in his book,  The  Lexus\r\n\r\nand  the  Olive Tree:  Understanding Globalisation, used  the\r\n\r\nterm  \"the global herd\" to describe the millions of investors\r\n\r\nworld-wide, who can be stampeded into running from an economy\r\n\r\nby the slightest signal of danger.  It is very important that\r\n\r\nwe keep the reputation of our financial institutions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintact  and  maintaining a system that is  open,  honest  and\r\n\r\ntransparent.   When we adopt very high ethical  standards  in\r\n\r\nthe public, private and people sectors, we will win the trust\r\n\r\nand confidence of investors in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much talk about PSA Corporation's loss of\r\n\r\nMaersk  Sealand to the Port of Tanjung Pelepas in  Johor  and\r\n\r\nthe competition hotting up between Singapore and Malaysia  in\r\n\r\nport  services  and  the risk of other major  shipping  lines\r\n\r\nexiting   from  Singapore.   Malaysia's  attempt  to  compete\r\n\r\nagainst  Singapore in port services is not new.  It was  Port\r\n\r\nKlang,  then Pasir Gudang and now Tanjung Pelepas.   Malaysia\r\n\r\nhas  also  developed  the Multi-Super  Corridor,  the  Sepang\r\n\r\nInternational   Airport  and  Senai  International   Airport.\r\n\r\nSingapore  cannot prevent external competition  whether  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia  or elsewhere.  The way for Singapore to respond  is\r\n\r\nto  do  so  calmly by examining ourselves, our strengths  and\r\n\r\nweaknesses  and  take all necessary measures  to  tackle  the\r\n\r\ncompetition and come out tops in the long run.  I think it is\r\n\r\ntoo early and premature to conclude, as some pundits seem  to\r\n\r\nsuggest,  that  PSA  Corporation has already  failed  in  its\r\n\r\nability  to  compete.  What is needed is for  the  Government\r\n\r\nMinistries  to  take  an  integrated  and  multi-disciplinary\r\n\r\nattitude in providing PSA Corporation with all the assistance\r\n\r\nit  needs to compete.  PSA Corporation will have to  stay  on\r\n\r\ncourse  and  remain  focussed,  taking  a  systems  and  team\r\n\r\napproach  in  meeting the competition head on.  By  providing\r\n\r\nhighly  cost  competitive  and  value  added  services,   PSA\r\n\r\nCorporation's management and workers, working together,  hold\r\n\r\nthe key to winning the competition and doing Singapore proud.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in meeting Singapore's increasing demand for land,\r\n\r\nwe should make no apologies to anyone in our extra efforts to\r\n\r\nreclaim  more land within our territory for future  use.   We\r\n\r\nowe  it  to our citizens to cater to their housing and  other\r\n\r\nland  needs.  We also need to secure our land for the present\r\n\r\nand future generation of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian politicians are an irksome and incredulous\r\n\r\nlot.   They  should know that Singaporeans are  a  discerning\r\n\r\ngroup who has wised up to their antics in the issues they try\r\n\r\nto  stir  up.  These no longer cut any ice with Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nInstead,  they  have  helped to rally and  bond  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncloser  together.   In the workplace, we  have  this  saying,\r\n\r\n\"Idle  minds are the devil's workshop.\"  Singaporeans can  no\r\n\r\nlonger  be  idle.   To  stay ahead, we cannot  afford  to  be\r\n\r\ndistracted  by unproductive, frivolous and meaningless  talks\r\n\r\nand  utterances.  In everything we do we are  accountable  to\r\n\r\nthe  stakeholders.  We have to be prudent and frugal  in  our\r\n\r\nfinancial  stewardship.  In times of crisis, we are  prepared\r\n\r\nand  ready  to  weather the ups and downs of economic  cycles\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are living in times of a highly volatile economic\r\n\r\nenvironment.   With  the  process of  employment  destruction\r\n\r\ntaking  place in the Singapore labour market, this has  given\r\n\r\nrise  to  greater  insecurity and job uncertainty.   For  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time  after  many years of strong economic  growth,  a\r\n\r\nlarge  number of managers, executives and professionals  have\r\n\r\nbeen  thrown out of work.  Who would imagine that  even  well\r\n\r\nqualified and experienced senior staff could lose their  jobs\r\n\r\nthrough  retrenchments?  The sign is clear that with economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring, no one is spared from the effects.  All levels\r\n\r\nof  staff have just to be prepared to make the next move  and\r\n\r\nmove  on.   There is no longer the stigma when someone  loses\r\n\r\nhis  job  because  of  mergers and acquisitions  and  company\r\n\r\nrestructuring.  However, I believe employers can adopt a more\r\n\r\nopen  and  humane  approach  when  releasing  surplus  staff.\r\n\r\nEmployers  should  give  affected staff  as  much  notice  as\r\n\r\npossible  to help them to come to terms and prepare  for  the\r\n\r\nnext  job  move.   Time could be given to put  surplus  staff\r\n\r\nthrough relevant training and skills upgrading programmes  to\r\n\r\nequip  them  for new jobs.  In this way, those  who  are  not\r\n\r\nimmediately  affected can take comfort that when  their  turn\r\n\r\ncomes  and their services no longer required, they can  leave\r\n\r\nthe organisation graciously and with their dignity intact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid the larger scale retrenchments in the\r\n\r\nfuture, I wish to propose that the tripartite bodies  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  National Employers' Federation, the NTUC  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower work out schemes of arrangement to  make\r\n\r\nit  easier for employers to periodically place out staff that\r\n\r\nthe  company  does not need.  By having regular out-placement\r\n\r\nexercises  in small numbers, the companies may be saved  from\r\n\r\nthe trauma and distress of retrenching large numbers of staff\r\n\r\nat  one  go,  and worse still, do so during hard  times  when\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  dearth  of alternative jobs in  the  employment\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's home grown entrepreneurs usually come from\r\n\r\nthe  small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  They are the  ones\r\n\r\nwith  the  most prospects and potential to grow further,  and\r\n\r\nappropriate help should be extended to them.  I  am  glad  to\r\n\r\nread  that SPRING Singapore, the new name for PSB, is  giving\r\n\r\nall  the support they can to the SMEs.  These SMEs also  need\r\n\r\nto  professionalise their management.  I hope that many young\r\n\r\naspiring   professionals  and  executives   will   join   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  ranks of the SMEs to help them develop  and  grow\r\n\r\nfurther.  I do not believe that only the very large companies\r\n\r\ncan  benefit from the global markets.  Our SMEs can also find\r\n\r\ntheir  rightful  places in niche markets.  The  SMEs  usually\r\n\r\nattract  less public attention and with their lower  profiles\r\n\r\ncan  strike  profitable ventures for themselves  in  overseas\r\n\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also not forget the traders and merchants who\r\n\r\nare  doing  roaring  overseas businesses.   The  High  Street\r\n\r\nCentre  merchants  have been concerned for some  years  about\r\n\r\ntheir long-term future.  Incidentally, High Street Centre  is\r\n\r\nin  my  constituency.  These merchants have established their\r\n\r\nbusiness contacts and network with customers from the  Middle\r\n\r\nEast  and the Indian sub-continent for many years.  I am glad\r\n\r\nthat only recently the URA has finally decided to retain  the\r\n\r\nHigh Street Centre which is across Parliament House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the Wholesale Centre at Victoria\r\n\r\nStreet, again in my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstituency.    This  group  of  dry  goods  merchants   was\r\n\r\nrelocated  from the former Ellenborough Market  at  Tew  Chew\r\n\r\nStreet to make way for the construction of the North-East MRT\r\n\r\nLine.   This  enterprising group of wholesalers  has  trading\r\n\r\nbusinesses  with  many  overseas  countries  including  Latin\r\n\r\nAmerica.   Over  the  years,  in  our  efforts  to  redevelop\r\n\r\nSingapore's  urban landscape, we may have unwittingly  caused\r\n\r\nthe demise of some important segments of our old economy.  We\r\n\r\nshould not close down businesses just because they belong  to\r\n\r\nthe  old economy.  Some of these businesses can be viable and\r\n\r\nhighly profitable.  It would be a shame that we lose them for\r\n\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming decade, we have reached the stage of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  the capacity to generate  4-5%  growth  per\r\n\r\nyear.   Singaporeans have to moderate their expectations  and\r\n\r\nplan  their  own  future  with this prospect  in  mind.   The\r\n\r\nchallenge  before  us  is  to seek  and  understand  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening in the world around us and to adapt and respond  to\r\n\r\nthe  changing times.  With inspiring and visionary leadership\r\n\r\nand a people with a positive attitude supporting and cheering\r\n\r\neach other along in the steep climb, I have no doubt that  we\r\n\r\nwill still make it again in the next decade and beyond.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the President's Speech. I think that\r\n\r\nwhat the President said in his speech are no exaggeration and\r\n\r\nare true.  However, a journalist in The Sunday Times reported\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  is reverting to  its  rule  of  crisis\r\n\r\ntactics  again.   I  do  not think  that  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nexaggerating or trying to create a crisis situation  when  it\r\n\r\nsays  that,  \"In  2001  the  US economy  slowed,  the  global\r\n\r\nelectronics  industry  slumped, and we experienced  our  most\r\n\r\nsevere  recession since independence.  .The  next  few  years\r\n\r\nwill  present  us  with  the most severe  challenges  in  our\r\n\r\nnation's history.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been a Member of Parliament for 18 years,\r\n\r\nand during that period\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore experienced three recessions: one in 1984/85,  then\r\n\r\nagain in 1998/99, and now in 2001/2002.  The present round of\r\n\r\nrecession is probably the worst of the three.  All HDB  shops\r\n\r\nin  my  constituency,  without exception,  complain  of  poor\r\n\r\nbusiness.   And at my weekly meet-the-people-session,  I  get\r\n\r\nregularly  one or two applications for jobs per  week  either\r\n\r\nfrom my own constituency's residents or from persons of other\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  Whereas in the past recessions,  I  did  not\r\n\r\nget  any applications for jobs at all.  I have no doubt  that\r\n\r\nthe  recession this time is the worst of the three recessions\r\n\r\nI have come across as an MP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the challenges to be faced by our nation in the\r\n\r\nnext  few  years, I think they are also very real.  The  most\r\n\r\nobvious challenge shall come from China.  They have a massive\r\n\r\npopulation of one billion people.  The workers there are just\r\n\r\nas  intelligent, hardworking and disciplined as our Singapore\r\n\r\nworkers  and  they  have made a success of  whatever  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments  that  have been ploughed into their  country  so\r\n\r\nfar.   If one visits America, one cannot escape the fact that\r\n\r\nnearly  all clothing, toys, jackets, shoes, towels  and  many\r\n\r\nother  retail items are made in China.  Those goods that  are\r\n\r\nmade  in  China and sold in America are of very high quality.\r\n\r\nI  am  certain that this is not the end of the road but  only\r\n\r\nthe  beginning.  There shall be more investments brought into\r\n\r\nChina from America and other developed western countries  and\r\n\r\nit shall certainly affect Singapore and the region.  It shall\r\n\r\nnot  be  easy  for Singapore and the region  to  get  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments  from  now  on because of  the  competition  from\r\n\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign investments shall not only go to China in\r\n\r\nmassive  scale  but also go to other copy-cat countries,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  Dubai.  I have been informed by a banker  in  Dubai\r\n\r\nthat  that  country has fashioned its economy after  that  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Dubai even starts its own airline, the  Emirates,\r\n\r\nlike that of SIA of Singapore.  From what I see, the Emirates\r\n\r\nAirline is now operating very successfully.  It certainly can\r\n\r\ngive SIA a run for its money.  Its fare structure, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelieve,  is even more competitive than that of  SIA.   In  a\r\n\r\nrecent  stopover  at  Dubai, I noted that  that  enclave  has\r\n\r\nbecome very prosperous.  Dubai has also a high percentage  of\r\n\r\nforeign workers, showing that its industries are booming.  As\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore's  attempt to branch into  higher  value-added\r\n\r\nindustries, like the IT business and industries in  the  life\r\n\r\nsciences, and attempts to attract foreign talent, we are also\r\n\r\nbeset  with  challenges from Japan, Korea,  Taiwan  and  Hong\r\n\r\nKong.   It  appears that there are no easy solutions  to  our\r\n\r\nproblems.   It looks like indeed we have to truly settle  for\r\n\r\nlower growth rates, growth rates at single rather than double\r\n\r\ndigits  of  the  past, unless, of course,  we  make  material\r\n\r\nchanges to our present situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set up the Economic Review Committee\r\n\r\nto  try to find solutions to maintain our high growth and  to\r\n\r\nsustain our prosperity.  But what can this Committee do?   It\r\n\r\ncannot  really do much.  There is no quick-fix to the present\r\n\r\nworld economic recession.  It is a case of over-production in\r\n\r\nthe  world economy.  It is a cyclical phenomenon.  The  world\r\n\r\nshall just have to sit this one out.  As for Singapore,  what\r\n\r\ncan  we  do?   I suppose the Committee shall recommend  cost-cutting  measures and be more competitive.  The last time  in\r\n\r\n1998,  it  was  our  workers  who  bore  the  brunt  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  cost-cutting measures.  I sincerely  hope  that\r\n\r\nthat remedy is not used again.  It must be recalled that  the\r\n\r\nworkers'  10% employer's component of CPF cut has  still  not\r\n\r\nbeen  fully restored.  It would be most unfair to our workers\r\n\r\nif  their  CPF is cut again when the damage done to them  the\r\n\r\nlast  time  has  still not been made good.  I hope  that  the\r\n\r\nlabour  MPs in this House shall fight for the workers' rights\r\n\r\nnot  to have another CPF and pay cuts.  My view is that  this\r\n\r\ntime  round, the Government should suffer some of  the  cost-cutting   measures,  if  any,  and  not  the  workers.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  could forgo some of its taxes, levies,  fees  and\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with a change of economic situation in the world,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  intends to change its political  and  social\r\n\r\nparadigms.  It now falls on Singaporeans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be more inquiring and to adopt an adventurous spirit.  It\r\n\r\nwants  Singaporeans to be leaders in business,  to  be  great\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs,  to  take more risks.  I would  say  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is probably 20 years too late.  Twenty years  have\r\n\r\nbeen  wasted  mainly  in  trying to contain  the  Opposition,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  spending that time to open up  our  society  and\r\n\r\nallow more freedom, allow more people who are not sympathetic\r\n\r\nto  the  PAP to speak up.  I would say that if that had  been\r\n\r\ndone,  the  spirit  of leadership and entrepreneurship  would\r\n\r\nhave  been  built up in our people.  Instead, the  Government\r\n\r\ntook  those  20 years to teach Confucianism in  our  schools,\r\n\r\nheralded the virtues of Confucius.  What that means was  that\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants  the people to be more subservient,  to  be\r\n\r\nmore  obedient and not to criticise Government  policies  too\r\n\r\nmuch.   What happened in those 20 years was that the  private\r\n\r\nsector was subdued and could not be vibrant and dynamic,  and\r\n\r\nonly  the  Government side took the initiative.   That  means\r\n\r\nmore  Government-linked companies are formed and there  would\r\n\r\nbe  only in-breeding in our business environment.  No wonder,\r\n\r\nmost  of  our  industrial activities are connected  with  the\r\n\r\nmanufacture of electronic goods.  Once that sector  collapses\r\n\r\nin the world market, Singapore gets into a bad recession.  We\r\n\r\nhave not diversified enough in our industries as there are no\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs to take the lead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other initiative taken by the Government is to have\r\n\r\ngreater  social  cohesion.  The Government  feels  that  with\r\n\r\ngreater economic changes, there shall be more dislocation and\r\n\r\nadjustments by our people.  With greater social cohesion, the\r\n\r\npeople  can  cope better with the faster pace of  change.   I\r\n\r\nwould agree with what the President said on those points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotion of entrepreneurship of our people and the\r\n\r\ninculcation  of greater social cohesion are all  one  of  the\r\n\r\nsame  issue.   They are social and political  in  nature.   I\r\n\r\nwould  say that the success of the Government's intention  to\r\n\r\nopen  up  our  society to encourage entrepreneurship  and  to\r\n\r\nbuild  greater social cohesion shall depend mostly on how  it\r\n\r\ntreats the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpposition.   If  the  Government  continues  to  treat   the\r\n\r\nOpposition very shabbily, as it is doing now, then the people\r\n\r\nknow that the Government is not sincere and shall not respond\r\n\r\npositively.  At the moment, the Opposition is treated like  a\r\n\r\nstep-child.   The  Government, as far as I  know,  has  never\r\n\r\nofficially said that it recognises the Opposition as  one  of\r\n\r\nour  national  institutions, and that the  Opposition  has  a\r\n\r\nrightful  place  in Parliament.  Instead, it  says  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  shall  drive  our  foreign  investors  away  from\r\n\r\nSingapore; the Opposition shall only be disruptive, which are\r\n\r\nall  not true.  The Opposition has an important role to  play\r\n\r\nin  Singapore's nation-building process, especially  at  this\r\n\r\ntime of globalisation where competition shall be fierce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government wants to succeed in its new programme\r\n\r\nof  encouraging  entrepreneurship and promote  closer  social\r\n\r\ncohesion,   then  it  must  change  its  treatment   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition.   It must treat the Opposition more  civilly  and\r\n\r\nshow some respect for the Opposition, for after all they  are\r\n\r\nelected by the people and not appointed by the Government and\r\n\r\nthey  are paid by taxpayers' money and not by the PAP.  As  a\r\n\r\nconcrete  proof of the Government's sincerity in  wanting  to\r\n\r\nbuild  social  cohesion, it must first restore the  walled-up\r\n\r\nareas  of the void decks for Opposition MPs to have a  proper\r\n\r\nplace  to meet their constituents.  The Opposition MPs cannot\r\n\r\nbe  treated like roadside fortune-tellers.  There  cannot  be\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion where the two Opposition representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  are not shown the proper respect  they  deserve.\r\n\r\nSocial  cohesion can only be promoted in Singapore where  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  treats the whole population equally  and  fairly.\r\n\r\nThe  Government must stop its discriminatory attitude towards\r\n\r\nthose  who  voted against the Government candidates  in  each\r\n\r\nelection.   The  Government must stop  its  policy  of  using\r\n\r\nGovernment programmes to punish those who refuse to vote  for\r\n\r\nit  by saying that should the people not vote its candidates,\r\n\r\nthen those constituencies will get their flats upgraded last,\r\n\r\nor   that   the   MRT  line  shall  not  run  through   their\r\n\r\nconstituency,  or  that the MRT station, having  being  built\r\n\r\nthere,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshall  not be opened.  How can the Government hope  to  build\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion  if it practises discrimination?   I  really\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  Government is really sincere in  wanting  to\r\n\r\nbuild  social cohesion in Singapore and immediately stop  its\r\n\r\ndiscrimination towards the Opposition MPs, Opposition members\r\n\r\nand  Opposition supporters, for they too are Singaporeans and\r\n\r\nhave an important role to play in nation building.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I support the motion standing in the name of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Marine  Parade  GRC,  Mrs Lim Hwee  Hua,  to  thank  the\r\n\r\nPresident  for  his  Address at  the  Opening  of  the  Tenth\r\n\r\nParliament..   The  President's Address outlines  the  severe\r\n\r\ntests  and  challenges  that Singapore  is   facing  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  determination to counter such  challenges.   In\r\n\r\nher  speech, Mrs Lim mentioned that the Presidential  Address\r\n\r\nhas  sounded three \"wake-up calls\", reminding us that we must\r\n\r\nwork   together   with  the  Government  to  overcome   these\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   Can  Singapore sustain  its  success  stories\r\n\r\nafter  our  pioneers  have stepped  down?  The  key  to  this\r\n\r\nquestion lies with the quality of our nationals.  There is  a\r\n\r\nsaying  in Hokkien, \"A generation of centipedes, a generation\r\n\r\nof  earthworms.\"  Will the nationals of Singapore become less\r\n\r\nand  less  capable,  turning  from  a  generation  of  strong\r\n\r\ncentipedes  to  that  of  some weak earthworms,  or  will  it\r\n\r\ntransform itself into a generation of robust, flying dragons?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that in this area, education plays a very, very\r\n\r\nimportant  role.  Education  is  the  key  to  the  long-term\r\n\r\nsurvival  of  our people.  But promotion of education  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  confined  to  the Ministry of Education  alone.   It\r\n\r\nshould be the concern of everybody. Everybody must take  part\r\n\r\nin  the  learning process. In the Addendum to the President's\r\n\r\nAddress, the Minister for Education reiterated that  we  must\r\n\r\nimplement policies which can bring out the best potential  of\r\n\r\nour  students, so that they will not only be able  to  master\r\n\r\nthe skills and knowledge, but also possess the right attitude\r\n\r\nand values.  Here, I am not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrying  to  advertise for the film \"I Not Stupid\".  But  this\r\n\r\nfilm  has given rise to a lot of discussions and talks  among\r\n\r\nour people. It emphasise the importance of education. It also\r\n\r\nshows that our people are deeply concerned with our education\r\n\r\nsystem,  especially  the streaming system.   Are  there  many\r\n\r\ndefects and faults in our streaming system?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our human resources are limited, Mr Speaker, Sir. If we\r\n\r\nwant  to  bring out the potential of every citizen,  we  must\r\n\r\nalso   teach   the  students  according  to  their   ability.\r\n\r\nStreaming is only a way, a means.  But why after more than 20\r\n\r\nyears  of  implementation, there is such a reaction from  our\r\n\r\npeople?   I  would  look at this question in  three  aspects:\r\n\r\nFirstly, the expectation of the parents and the perception of\r\n\r\nthe  society in general. Something is apparently wrong  here.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the attitude of the schools towards those  students\r\n\r\nwho  are  being streamed into EM3 or ITE.  And, thirdly,  the\r\n\r\nage  at which students are streamed.  These three points  are\r\n\r\ninter-related.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our society, general importance is attached to the\r\n\r\nposition  in school.  As a result, parents' expectations  for\r\n\r\ntheir  children are very high.  Because of this,  for  better\r\n\r\nresults,  a  lot  of parents put a lot of pressure  on  their\r\n\r\nchildren  so  that the children are made to  feel  averse  to\r\n\r\nlearning.   This becomes a vicious cycle.  In  addition,  the\r\n\r\nsociety  and parents also have a wrong perception on the  EM3\r\n\r\nand  the  ITE or technical education stream.  \"I Not  Stupid\"\r\n\r\ndescribed ITE as \"It's The End\".  This is a typical example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the society regards those weak in\r\n\r\nlearning  and  slow  in  learning as born  losers.   This  is\r\n\r\nagainst the intention of the streaming system.  Streaming  is\r\n\r\nintended to help this group of students who are slow learners\r\n\r\nand  to allow them to cope better in a more comfortable pace,\r\n\r\nso  that they can eventually develop their potential  to  the\r\n\r\nfullest,  in due course.  It is therefore necessary  that  we\r\n\r\ncorrect  this  wrong  attitude and wrong  perception  of  the\r\n\r\nparents and the society in general.  Under the new system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  technical education, these students will be able to learn\r\n\r\nnew skills, whereas under the old system, these slow starters\r\n\r\nwould be eliminated and sieved out of the school system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after many years of changes and\r\n\r\ninnovation,  our technical education system is now  upgraded.\r\n\r\nStudents  who  join the ITE get to learn a  lot  of  new  and\r\n\r\nadvanced  technology and skills. As far as I  know,  ITE  has\r\n\r\nestablished  direct  links  with  some  well-known  technical\r\n\r\nschools  overseas.  For example, Yishun ITE in which I  serve\r\n\r\nas a memebr of the Advisory Committee, has joined up with the\r\n\r\nAlbuquerque  College  of  the United  States  of  America  to\r\n\r\njointly   develop  technical  courses  on  wafer  technology.\r\n\r\nStudents  of  Yishun ITE  have the opportunity to  learn  the\r\n\r\nmost  advanced  technology, and even go over  to  the  United\r\n\r\nStates  for training.    Graduates of the ITE nowadays  enjoy\r\n\r\ngood  job  prospects.  Last year, because of recession,  many\r\n\r\nuniversity graduates could not  find a job.  But 86%  of  the\r\n\r\ngraduates  of  ITE secured their first jobs upon  graduation.\r\n\r\nSo, ITE is not \"It's The End\" after all!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must correct the attitude of certain schools towards\r\n\r\nthe  EM3  and  ITE students.  Many parents and students  have\r\n\r\ngiven  feedback  that  in some schools,  these  students  are\r\n\r\nregarded as \"problem students\" and are discriminated against.\r\n\r\nSome  have  even regarded the EM3 students as  some  kind  of\r\n\r\nliability,  likely to affect the ranking of  the  school.  We\r\n\r\nshould  implement  the idea of teaching  according  to  their\r\n\r\nability.   We  must give these students more  help  and  good\r\n\r\nteachers.  And as parents and members of the society, we must\r\n\r\ngive  them  encouragement  and help  them  to  restore  their\r\n\r\nconfidence and self-respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, basically, I am supportive of the\r\n\r\nstreaming policy.  But in implementing the streaming  system,\r\n\r\nwe must correct certain misconceptions and the wrong attitude\r\n\r\nof some people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is on the question of age at which\r\n\r\nstreaming should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimplemented.  Normally, the students are streamed  between  9\r\n\r\nand  10  years.   At  this stage of their development,  their\r\n\r\nintellect  has not been fully developed yet.  Sir,  according\r\n\r\nto the Piaget Theory of Cognitive Development, there are four\r\n\r\nstages  of   development in the children's life.  First,  the\r\n\r\nsensory-motor  phase  from ages 0 to 2.  Secondly,  the  pre-operational  phase from ages 2 to 7.  Thirdly,  the  concrete\r\n\r\noperational  phase  from  ages 7 to 11.  Lastly,  the  formal\r\n\r\noperational  phase from age 12 onwards.  It is only  at  this\r\n\r\nlast  stage  that  the children will be capable  of  abstract\r\n\r\nthinking.   From this  theory, it may seem not to be  correct\r\n\r\nto  stream students at the age of 10.  I think this should be\r\n\r\nreviewed,  although it has been practised for  more  than  20\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from the inculcation of skills\r\n\r\nand  knowledge, we must also stress on the character-building\r\n\r\naspect  of  education, the inculcation of  values  and  moral\r\n\r\nstandards.   We must be able to cultivate students  with  the\r\n\r\nright  character  in  order  to survive and  prosper  in  the\r\n\r\nchanging  world.  If our students do not have a comprehensive\r\n\r\nbuild-up  of  their  strong character with  adaptability  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility to the society, family, loyalty and the  sense\r\n\r\nof  belonging  to the nation, then we will  not  be  able  to\r\n\r\nattain the objective of our nation building.  The family  and\r\n\r\nthe  schools are the best places for building and  developing\r\n\r\nthe  character  of  our  students.   We  must  systematically\r\n\r\ninculcate in the minds of our children the right values.   We\r\n\r\nmust  make  sure  that  our children are  knowledgeable.   In\r\n\r\naddition, they must be benevolent and courageous.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nthink without learning.  As Confucius said, \"Learning without\r\n\r\nthinking   is  futile,  and  thinking  without  learning   is\r\n\r\ndangerous.\"   So here, I would like to refute what  Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nSee Tong had said about the teaching of Confucius. He alleged\r\n\r\nthat  Confucianism made us subservient and  obedient  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   I  think  he  has misunderstood  the  Confucius\r\n\r\nteaching.    Confucius  stresses the importance  between  the\r\n\r\nindividual  in  the  society and the  family.   It  does  not\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the  people  should just  be  subservient  and\r\n\r\nobedient to the Government, with no questions asked.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our students must also have the sense\r\n\r\nof  benevolence in the modern society. It should  take  on  a\r\n\r\nwider  meaning to imply that we must have the spirit of  care\r\n\r\nand  concern to society, to our friends and our family.   And\r\n\r\nfinally,  our  students must also be brave,   have  a  strong\r\n\r\ncharacter and a strong will power.  It is only with this kind\r\n\r\nof  spiritual  strength that our students  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nsurvive and become undaunted in the ever changing world.   So\r\n\r\nonce  the  character of the students has been  built  up  and\r\n\r\ndeveloped, we must ensure that this virtue will be  reflected\r\n\r\nin  our social bonding and also in our sense of belonging  to\r\n\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a multi-racial society like Singapore, we must teach\r\n\r\nour children, from the very early ages, to understand and\r\n\r\nappreciate the importance of racial and religious harmony in\r\n\r\nour society. We must give them the religious knowledge and\r\n\r\nunderstanding so that they will understand the different\r\n\r\nfeatures of the various religions and the different ways of\r\n\r\nlife.  And this will not be confined to just one single\r\n\r\neducation system or religion.  It is only with this kind of\r\n\r\nunderstanding and through the organised activities involving\r\n\r\nstudents of different ethnic groups, will our students learn\r\n\r\nto interact with one another, and to have tolerance for one\r\n\r\nanother's religious and cultural practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young people generally are indifferent to political\r\n\r\naffairs.  I feel that in our National Education Programme  in\r\n\r\nthe schools, we should enhance the political awareness of our\r\n\r\nstudents,  and  arouse their interest in current  affairs  so\r\n\r\nthat  they can be involved in the social and political  well-being.  They should be encouraged to participate in community\r\n\r\nwork, and  to show their care and concern for the society and\r\n\r\ncommunity.   To  enhance  the  political  awareness  of   the\r\n\r\nstudents,  we will be able to strengthen their identification\r\n\r\nwith the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to raise the question of mother-tongue education, especially\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe Chinese language in our schools.  The standard of Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage  is  an issue.  After the opening up of  China,  our\r\n\r\nsociety  claims  to have a lot of bilingual people  and  they\r\n\r\nfeel  that they can hitch a ride on the fast train to  China.\r\n\r\nIf  we want to maintain this advantage, then we should ensure\r\n\r\nthat the standard of Chinese language among our students must\r\n\r\nattain a certain standard of proficiency, so that we will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  take  advantage  of the development  of  China  and\r\n\r\ncommunicate  with the Chinese people.  Then we can  find  our\r\n\r\nplace there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as it is said, \"It takes 10 years to\r\n\r\ngrow  a  tree  and  100  years to  develop  a  person.\"   So,\r\n\r\neducation  is not a simple task.  Over the past few  decades,\r\n\r\nour  education  system has been implemented with  vision  and\r\n\r\npractical means.  I believe that so long as we continue  with\r\n\r\nthis spirit and attitude, we will be able to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nquality  of our people will become better so that the  future\r\n\r\ngenerations  will be better than our current generation,  and\r\n\r\nour success story can be sustained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this spirit, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak  in support of the Motion by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua to  thank\r\n\r\nthe President for his Address to Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President has outlined the changed\r\n\r\nworld    scenarios   after   the   September   11   incident.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are faced with tougher challenges  ahead.   The\r\n\r\nfoundation at home must continue to be built on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being one of the new Members of Parliament, we have been\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  advised to keep our speeches  short  and  to  the\r\n\r\npoint.  I will take heed and plunge into the concerns that  I\r\n\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year-end and beginning of this year, I was faced\r\n\r\nwith   cases  which  deeply  concern  me.   Among  my   close\r\n\r\nassociates, there are two cases of teenaged children\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleaving school prematurely at secondary 3 and 4.  I have also\r\n\r\nseen  two  other cases at my meet-the-people session  of  two\r\n\r\nchildren being asked to leave school by their principals  due\r\n\r\nto   disciplinary  problems  and  asking  for  help  to  find\r\n\r\nalternative   neighbourhood  schools.   Taking  this   simple\r\n\r\nstatistic   sampling  by  the  count  of   one   person   and\r\n\r\nextrapolating  to  the 84 + 1 MPs, I am  concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nstatistics  as I am certain there are many more  such  cases.\r\n\r\nIn  one  of  the  reports that I have read from  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nTechnological  University  on  factors  affecting  adolescent\r\n\r\ndelinquency in Singapore, age and family income are found  to\r\n\r\nbe significant in influencing the delinquency of adolescents.\r\n\r\nThe  report indicated that delinquency tends to peak  at  age\r\n\r\n15,  ie,  mid-adolescence.  Coincidentally, this matches  the\r\n\r\ncases that I have experienced on the early school-leavers  at\r\n\r\nsecondary  3  and 4.  The other significant factor  from  the\r\n\r\nreport  suggests dual-income family or parents  who  have  to\r\n\r\nspend more time on their jobs, resulting in the reduction  of\r\n\r\ntime  for  their children.   Three out of the  four  cases  I\r\n\r\nhighlighted  earlier are dual-income families.  It  therefore\r\n\r\ngives  me  great concern, as looking at the present  economic\r\n\r\nsituation,  most parents need to work extra hours  and  extra\r\n\r\nhard for fear of losing their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must be wondering, since I have been talking of\r\n\r\nearly school-leavers, how many are we talking about:  I  read\r\n\r\nthe  report by the Ministry of Education from the MOE website\r\n\r\nand got the yearly secondary school-leaver figure of 3.5%  in\r\n\r\n1999.   Checking  again the website, I could  only  find  the\r\n\r\ncohort  of  the  \"A\" level students.  However,  knowing  that\r\n\r\nabout  29%  of  the  \"O\"  levels go to the  \"A\"-level  helps,\r\n\r\nextrapolate it, the figure should be about 40,000.  Then  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is: 3.5% of each level of the secondary schools  or\r\n\r\n3.5% of the four levels?  This is not clear in the Minister's\r\n\r\nreport.  So the numbers come to the range of 1,400 to  5,600.\r\n\r\nAnd  you may ask why I did not ask the Ministry directly.   I\r\n\r\ndid.   I was told that they must be fair to all MPs.   And  I\r\n\r\nalso  had the opportunity to speak to DPM Lee and he told  me\r\n\r\nthat is fair treatment.  Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to highlight to our Opposition Members that\r\n\r\nwe do not get special treatment in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To gain another approach to quantify this number of\r\n\r\nschool-leavers,  I  found through the MHA  website  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber of juvenile delinquents hovers around 2,000 each year.\r\n\r\nPart  of  this number of delinquents might be from the  early\r\n\r\nschool-leavers.   As these children have more  free  time  in\r\n\r\ntheir  hands,  their  working  parents  might  find  it  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  handle them.  Some parents who  actually  lose\r\n\r\ncontrol  of them, most of these teenagers could not  work  as\r\n\r\nthey  are underaged.  They will simply loiter around and  mix\r\n\r\nwith  older  youths who may be of bad company.   Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthese children are very vulnerable at this tender age, as can\r\n\r\nbe seen in the Anthony Ler murder case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to my point, the number of early secondary school\r\n\r\nleavers  is still large each year.  There is an old  Biblical\r\n\r\nsaying that I find very true: \"You shall reap what you  sow\".\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we do not take the right steps now to safeguard\r\n\r\nour  youths  and  help  those who are  at  risk  due  to  the\r\n\r\ncomplexities of families today, then I am sad to say we  will\r\n\r\nrisk reaping a bad harvest, with more complex societal issues\r\n\r\nto manage, in the years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are the possible actions? I would like to\r\n\r\nappeal for an integrated multi-agency approach in identifying\r\n\r\nthe  potential early school leavers.  I wish to  call  for  a\r\n\r\ntripartite  relationship with the teachers, the  parents  and\r\n\r\nthe  students.  In view of the fact that both the parents are\r\n\r\nworking, I would say the contact time of the children will be\r\n\r\nmuch longer with their teachers instead of their parents.   I\r\n\r\nam  not  pushing  the  responsibility of  upbringing  to  the\r\n\r\nteachers,  but ask for collaboration with the teachers.   The\r\n\r\nteachers who are being trained to deal with children would be\r\n\r\nable  to  identify the high-risk children from  as  early  as\r\n\r\nsecondary 1 and quickly refer them to appropriate counselling\r\n\r\nfor closer attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Closer attention\" - what do we mean by that? I would\r\n\r\nlike to urge the Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   Education,  jointly  with  the  Ministry  of   Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and Sports, to consider having  a  student  care\r\n\r\nservice at the secondary level, and I applaud the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunity Development and Sports for having done well in  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of child-care and student-care services  for  pre-nursery  to  primary  school children.  When  these  children\r\n\r\nreach  secondary school, most of them are left alone  in  the\r\n\r\nafternoon.   As the school hours are not fixed,  in  view  of\r\n\r\ncurriculum  activities  and  the  ad-hoc  remedial   classes,\r\n\r\nparents  have  no  way of knowing the hours except  from  the\r\n\r\nchildren  themselves.   Employ retired teachers  or  suitable\r\n\r\nprofessionals in supervising these children in the  afternoon\r\n\r\nand  parents  can be asked to pay for the service.   Subsidy,\r\n\r\nlike  the  case of child-care services, can be given  to  the\r\n\r\nlower-income  family.   Some of these  supervisors  could  be\r\n\r\ntrained  as  counsellors  and we could  identify  and  create\r\n\r\nsecond  careers in this area too, especially for  middle  and\r\n\r\nlate   professionals  and  managers.   We  have   been   very\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  getting  mid-career professionals  to  become\r\n\r\nteachers.   Now  we can try training these  middle  and  late\r\n\r\ncareer  professionals to be counsellors as  well  as  student\r\n\r\ncaregivers.  With their extended background experience in the\r\n\r\nworkforce and their experience in bringing up their children,\r\n\r\nthey  could  also be a source of role models  for  them.   It\r\n\r\ncould  be even better if we could attract male professionals.\r\n\r\nWhy?   Because the report revealed that paternal care is very\r\n\r\nimportant in the behavioral development of adolescents.   The\r\n\r\nmale  figure is still seen as the disciplinary figure in  the\r\n\r\nAsian culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I would like to applaud the Inter-Ministry Committee on Youth Crime on its efforts in bringing\r\n\r\ndown  the youth crime rate by identifying youth crime  trends\r\n\r\nand  high-risk youths early.  This was reported  recently  by\r\n\r\nAssociate Professor Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State for\r\n\r\nLaw  and  Home  Affairs, and Chairman of  the  Inter-Ministry\r\n\r\nCommittee on Youth Crime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to congratulate the five Mayors on\r\n\r\ntheir appointment earlier\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis year.  Most of them have been serving as Chairmen of the\r\n\r\nCDCs  before and, now, as Mayors.  The CDCs were  created  in\r\n\r\n1997.   The  concept of CDCs has been explained  as  a  local\r\n\r\ncommunity approach to the building of community bonds and the\r\n\r\ndelivery  of  local social services.  Here, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nurge  the  CDC  to realign its resources in the  delivery  of\r\n\r\nlocal  social services.  Two aspects of social services which\r\n\r\nI  wish  to  highlight are:  (1) job-matching and retraining;\r\n\r\n(2)  the use of the established network of the Family Service\r\n\r\nCentres  (FSCs).  Most of the CDCs are organising  job  fairs\r\n\r\nfrequently and have job-matching service.  Most of  the  jobs\r\n\r\noffered are from those available at the MOM Job Bank.  I also\r\n\r\nfound  that  some  CDCs did a little bit more  by  forming  a\r\n\r\nCorporate   Relations   Committee   to   identify   potential\r\n\r\nemployers,  and  some were innovative of revamping  from  JAP\r\n\r\n(Job  Application and Placement) to JELL (Jobs, Employability\r\n\r\nand  Lifelong Learning).  The result of job-matching is still\r\n\r\npoor.   Yes, the reasons are many.  But many blame it on  the\r\n\r\nattitude and mindset of the people.  So when they come to the\r\n\r\nMPS  with  many unpaid bills, who and how do we  solve  these\r\n\r\ndifficulties?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the CDCs and MOM to comprehensively\r\n\r\ntake  a  fresh look at the job-matching service.   Go  beyond\r\n\r\njust  job  matching  and instead introduce  intervention  job\r\n\r\nmatching.  And what do I mean by that?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge MOM and the CDCs to work with the\r\n\r\npotential   employers,  understand  their  requirements   and\r\n\r\nidentify  the  suitable set of skills  that  is  required  to\r\n\r\nperform  this work.  Identify the target groups of employees,\r\n\r\nre-engineer the skill sets, if necessary, to suit the  target\r\n\r\ngroups of employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that McDonald's has done a very good job in\r\n\r\nthis  area.   They  know  that  it  is  difficult  for  older\r\n\r\nemployees  at  the  service  counter  to  remember  all   the\r\n\r\ndifferent items to collect and pack when they serve a  drink,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  coffee  and tea.  But they prepare the  sugar,  the\r\n\r\nstirrer and the creamer into a bag.  So instead\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  remembering three items, they just remember to  take  out\r\n\r\nthe pack.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of retraining, there could be better\r\n\r\nmatching  of  training  needs  and  training  demands.    For\r\n\r\nexample,  MOM or CDC could advise on the type of  job  skills\r\n\r\nneeded after discussing with the potential employers and then\r\n\r\nencourage  the  unemployed  to  go  for  retraining  in   the\r\n\r\nspecified skill sets.  Once the opportunity for employment is\r\n\r\nthere, people would be more willing to spend the time and  go\r\n\r\nfor  the specific training.  Here, the joint agency could  do\r\n\r\nmore   to   assist  the  potential  employers   actively   on\r\n\r\nidentifying the necessary retraining funding.  If the success\r\n\r\nrate  for finding a job can be improved and publicised,  this\r\n\r\nwill  encourage  people to go for the right  type  of  skills\r\n\r\nretraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second aspect of Family Service Centres, I would\r\n\r\nalso like to urge the CDCs to concentrate on the delivery  of\r\n\r\nsocial  services  to  the  families at  the  local  community\r\n\r\nthrough  the established networks of FSCs, especially  during\r\n\r\nthis economic downturn.  The importance of families cannot be\r\n\r\nunderestimated.  Families are the foundation of our  society.\r\n\r\nAnd  why  do I choose FSCs?  It is because the family service\r\n\r\nareas are already set up at the focal points providing social\r\n\r\nservice  to promote and strengthen the well-being of families\r\n\r\nin the local community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FSCs have three unique features. FSCs focus on the\r\n\r\nfamily as a primary unit of intervention and services.   FSCs\r\n\r\nprovide  a spectrum of services that address the wide variety\r\n\r\nof  family  needs either directly or indirectly.   FSCs  have\r\n\r\nestablished   linkages   in  other  social   and   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations situated in a local community.  The  FSCs  lack\r\n\r\nthe  publicity  and recognition as compared to the  important\r\n\r\nroles  FSCs  play.   The FSCs are well-positioned  to  foster\r\n\r\ngreater  inter-agency collaboration to build a closer network\r\n\r\nof  service for the family.  There are about 35 FSCs  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious housing estates compared to our five CDCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FSCs could be the branch offices of the CDCs for\r\n\r\nfamily-focused services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently, for the family and social service cases,  the  CDC\r\n\r\nundertakes the investigation role and refers their  cases  to\r\n\r\nthe  FSC, if necessary, and this takes up a long time  before\r\n\r\nwe  could get any answers.  I would suggest that the role  be\r\n\r\nreversed.   As  FSCs  are now nearer to  the  families,  they\r\n\r\nshould undertake the investigation role and the result  would\r\n\r\nbe much faster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDC at the district level is still remote for the family\r\n\r\nto access its services.  The time taken for the investigation\r\n\r\nand help to the families in need would be shorter through the\r\n\r\nnetwork of FSCs.  In the Addendum to the President's Address,\r\n\r\nAssoc.  Prof.  Yaacob Ibrahim, Acting Minister for  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment and Sports, had mentioned that the Ministry would\r\n\r\nwork  with CDCs to improve the training of social workers  at\r\n\r\nthe district level in order to increase the responsiveness of\r\n\r\nsocial agencies within the community.  I urge the Minister to\r\n\r\ninclude  the  FSCs in his review.  In summary, I  appeal  for\r\n\r\nsupport to be given to, first, working parents - about 49% of\r\n\r\nthe  working force are women.  Second, in order to reduce the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  early secondary school leavers, to work  actively\r\n\r\nwith  the employers to either identify the skill set for  the\r\n\r\njob  and to persuade the unemployed to undergo retraining for\r\n\r\nthe   identified  skill  set  or  to  re-engineer  their  job\r\n\r\nspecifications for the ready pool of unemployed.  Third,  the\r\n\r\nCDC  should  tap the already established FSCs to  handle  the\r\n\r\nprimary investigation of the family assistance cases  at  the\r\n\r\nlocal community and support the working parents and promote a\r\n\r\nclosely-knit family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion of Thanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in his Address, President Nathan  highlighted\r\n\r\nthe   challenges  which  Singapore  faces.   I  believe  most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are aware of this fact, but it takes  time  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  understand  the  long-term  implications  of  these\r\n\r\nchallenges.   Only when they have personally experienced  the\r\n\r\neffects of these changes will they appreciate the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseriousness  of  the  implications  brought  about   by   the\r\n\r\nemergence  of  China and the unpredictable situation  of  our\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the moment, the main concern of most people is on\r\n\r\nthe  bread  and butter issue.  When you have entered  middle-age,   say,   40   and  above,  retrenchment  means   instant\r\n\r\nunemployment  as  it will be difficult to find  another  job.\r\n\r\nThis affects not only the lowly-educated people, but even the\r\n\r\ndegree-holders and executives, as we see many companies which\r\n\r\nare making huge profits are also retrenching.  The executives\r\n\r\nfind  it difficult getting alternative jobs because they  are\r\n\r\noften deemed to be over-qualified.  We can only urge them  to\r\n\r\nlower their expectation and to go for re-skilling.  But  even\r\n\r\nwith re-skilling, there is no guarantee that they will find a\r\n\r\njob.  So, what should we do?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone expects the Government to come up with a\r\n\r\nsolution  and there are indeed various programmes  instituted\r\n\r\nby  the Government  to help older workers seek re-employment,\r\n\r\nincluding  incentives for employers to engage older  workers.\r\n\r\nThese  strategies have helped some affected workers get  jobs\r\n\r\nbut  it is very tough to convince all affected workers to  go\r\n\r\nfor  re-skilling.  In NTUC, we have worked very hard with our\r\n\r\naffiliated  trade unions to urge our workers to  go  for  re-skilling  and to equip themselves in order to be in a  better\r\n\r\nposition to seek re-employment.  Just now, Mr Chiam See  Tong\r\n\r\nmentioned  that NTUC and the labour MPs should fight  against\r\n\r\nlowering of wages and CPF.  I think if he had participated in\r\n\r\nour  dialogue  sessions, he would know that our  workers  are\r\n\r\nmore  concerned  with keeping their jobs than  keeping  their\r\n\r\nwages  intact.  If the factories cannot survive and  have  to\r\n\r\nclose  down, their jobs are gone.  If the orders are reduced,\r\n\r\nthen they would have to settle for shorter working hours, and\r\n\r\nthat  means  less  income.  If Mr Chiam  See  Tong  does  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  this  problem, then let me give him  an  analogy.\r\n\r\nMany  people are complaining that they have been  working  so\r\n\r\nhard  that their hair has turned grey.  To them, I would say,\r\n\r\n\"Consider yourselves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlucky that you are still having hair on your head. There  are\r\n\r\nmany others who have no hair at all.\"  So having grey hair is\r\n\r\nstill  better than having no hair at all!  I think  having  a\r\n\r\njob is surely better than having no job.  This is the reality\r\n\r\nof life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Chiam does not understand, I would urge him to\r\n\r\ncome  with  us to visit the factories.  We, labour MPs,  have\r\n\r\nbeen visiting the factories and speaking to the workers.   We\r\n\r\nknow  what  the  workers are going through.  At  the  present\r\n\r\nmoment  of recession, the workers' concern is not for  higher\r\n\r\nincome.   They  are more concerned with keeping  their  jobs.\r\n\r\nThey  also  know  where  the  challenges  are  and  they  are\r\n\r\nadjusting their expectation.  But it takes time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think our union leaders understand the situation\r\n\r\nbetter  than  Mr Chiam See Tong.  Even in Vietnam,  they  are\r\n\r\nfacing challenges from China.  In the past, they had a lot of\r\n\r\nbicycles  on  the road.  Now there are a lot of  motorcycles.\r\n\r\nWhy  is  it  so?  This  is because Vietnam  is  also  getting\r\n\r\naffluent.  They are challenging us.  Their workers' salary is\r\n\r\nonly  one-fifth of what our workers are getting. In the past,\r\n\r\nthey had a Japanese motorcycle company, Honda, which produced\r\n\r\na  very  popular locally manufactured model called  \"Dreamy\".\r\n\r\nIt  was selling at US$2,000.  But now, with motorcycles being\r\n\r\nimported  from China, \"Dreamy\" has to be sold  at  less  than\r\n\r\nUS$2,000.  The Chinese produced a motorcycle known  as  \"Hong\r\n\r\nDa\"  and  it  is  now selling at only $600.   The  Vietnamese\r\n\r\nmanufacturers soon find that they could not sleep  at  night,\r\n\r\nand hence \"dreamy\" no more!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong also mentioned that the Government has\r\n\r\nnot given the  Opposition parties their due recognition.   He\r\n\r\nsaid  that  they  are now being reduced to the  status  of  a\r\n\r\nfortune  teller.   I  do not think he is  a  fortune  teller,\r\n\r\notherwise he would not have introduced Dr Chee Soon  Juan  to\r\n\r\nhis  Singapore  Democratic Party.    Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  some\r\n\r\npeople  said  that  Singaporeans are  very  obedient  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   When  the  Government  asks  them  not  to   do\r\n\r\nsomething,  they  would not do it.  But  now  the  Government\r\n\r\nwants\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  to  change  jobs.  They called upon  the  employers  to\r\n\r\nemploy  the  older  workers.  But there are  still  problems.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, when the Government formulates its policies,\r\n\r\nit  often  fails  to have a good grasp of the  human  nature.\r\n\r\nVery  often,  it  will take the available statistics  as  the\r\n\r\nbasis  to  work out some solutions, without making  some  in-depth analysis of the characteristics of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is this argument that there are a few hundred\r\n\r\nthousand foreign workers here and there are less than 100,000\r\n\r\nunemployed Singaporeans, and if all Singaporeans are prepared\r\n\r\nto  take  up these jobs which are currently taken up  by  the\r\n\r\nforeign  workers,  then there should not be any  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem.  But then, we must not forget that in the process of\r\n\r\ntransition,  there  are  many  problems  relating  to   their\r\n\r\nchildren's education, family members, etc, which have  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken  into  consideration.  Of  course,  we  know  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has recognised the importance of re-skilling  for\r\n\r\nour  workers, but then, even after re-skilling, the employers\r\n\r\nmight not want to employ them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite another example. In Singapore, there are\r\n\r\nmany people who are unmarried.  By the same logic, if we  ask\r\n\r\nall  the  unmarried males to marry all the unmarried females,\r\n\r\nthere  would not be any problem of low population growth  and\r\n\r\nexcessive  unmarried  young people in our  society.   But  we\r\n\r\nobserve that there are a lot of foreign brides and a  lot  of\r\n\r\nforeign grooms in Singapore, while the unmarried  ones remain\r\n\r\nunmarried.  This is a problem similar to that of the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.   Even when these people get married,  it  does  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  mean  that they would have  children,  and  many\r\n\r\nmarriages even end up in divorces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these figures and statistics can only serve as a\r\n\r\nreference.   We  must not neglect the human  factor  when  we\r\n\r\nformulate Government policies.  We cannot always explain  the\r\n\r\ntrends  by  the data and figures at hand.  In  the  past  two\r\n\r\nyears,  many events have happened in Singapore, such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  the DBS incident and the erroneous utilities bills.   HDB\r\n\r\nplanned their building programmes based on the demands of the\r\n\r\npeople.  Yet, there is now an over supply of flats. These are\r\n\r\nsome  examples of how we have neglected the human nature when\r\n\r\nwe formulated the policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the initial period of our nation-building, we wanted\r\n\r\nto  build a rugged  society, one that can withstand  all  the\r\n\r\nthunderstorms, one where the people fear no  difficulties and\r\n\r\none   where   the   people   could  actually   move   forward\r\n\r\ncourageously.    Over   the  years,  Singapore   has   become\r\n\r\nprosperous  and there is home for everyone. With the  various\r\n\r\nHDB  upgrading programmes, we have covered walkways that link\r\n\r\nthe  apartment  blocks to the bus stops,  and  linkways  that\r\n\r\nconnect  one  block to another.   But now the  residents  are\r\n\r\nstill  complaining. They cried, \"No linkway,  how  to  go  to\r\n\r\nmarket?\"  Yes, they are never contented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, many Singaporeans do not bother to use their\r\n\r\nheads  to  resolve even very minute problems.   Many complain\r\n\r\nthat  they  are \"stuck\".  They cannot go up or go  down.   In\r\n\r\nactual  fact, all they need to do is just to use their heads,\r\n\r\nput in  a little effort, make some adjustments, you can go up\r\n\r\nor  get down.  They can easily get themselves \"unstuck\". Yet,\r\n\r\nall  they do is to sit around and wait for the Government  to\r\n\r\nsolve their problems, and alas, the Government has come!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, everybody is waiting to see what the Economic\r\n\r\nReview Committee can do to cut business cost and enhance  our\r\n\r\nglobal  competitiveness. The people are also waiting  to  see\r\n\r\nhow  the  \"Re-making Singapore Committee\" is going to reshape\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  establish  itself  as  a  regional   hub   and\r\n\r\nmetropolitan city of excellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my sincere hope that while transforming and\r\n\r\nrestructuring,  these committees and the  various  ministries\r\n\r\nand  statutory boards would take into consideration not  only\r\n\r\nthe  data  and  statistics but also  the  characteristics  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, typified by the kiasu (afraid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  lose)  and kiasi (afraid to die) mentalities.  We  should\r\n\r\ntrain our people and cultivate in them what I would call  the\r\n\r\n\"camel spirit\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camel is a very kind-natured animal. It can move\r\n\r\nsteadily  and steadfastly, even in very difficult situations.\r\n\r\nThey  are  not  afraid of the sand-storm, and not  afraid  of\r\n\r\nhaving no water supply - even if Malaysia cuts off the  water\r\n\r\nsupply, no problem!  They can carry heavy objects and  travel\r\n\r\nafar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans certainly have this potential. We have\r\n\r\nalready  seen many Singaporean \"camels\" in action.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nwhen Singaporeans, young or old, men or women, travel abroad,\r\n\r\ntheir  \"camel  spirit\" is fully manifested. The  moment  they\r\n\r\nhave  checked  into the hotel, they will rush  out  into  the\r\n\r\nstreets, making full use of every second available.  They are\r\n\r\nnot  afraid of going the wrong way, not afraid of walking for\r\n\r\nmiles and miles, not afraid of missing dinner, and not afraid\r\n\r\nof  having  no water to drink. They would just go  ahead  and\r\n\r\nshop,  shop and shop, so much so they need to buy a few  more\r\n\r\nsuitcases to bring home their purchases. If you go to  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport, you can see all these \"troops of camels\" coming home\r\n\r\nafter  some triumphant shopping expeditions, and showing  off\r\n\r\ntheir trophies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all realise that Singapore is facing\r\n\r\na  lot of challenges.  We want to participate and shape a new\r\n\r\nSingapore  so  that  we  can  be  victorious  in  the  global\r\n\r\ncompetition.   But  we must not be afraid of  suffering,  nor\r\n\r\nafraid  of facing difficulties.  This is the \"camel  spirit\".\r\n\r\nThe  first  generation of Singaporeans  acquired  this  camel\r\n\r\nspirit,  while the second generation strove to maintain  this\r\n\r\ncamel spirit. Now, the  third generation of Singaporeans must\r\n\r\nalso  possess  this  camel spirit  of  not  being  afraid  of\r\n\r\nsufferings and not afraid of facing hardships. They must  not\r\n\r\nend up like the ostrich instead!\r\n\r\n<br>2.10 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I speak in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the motion by the Member for Marine Parade  GRC.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  know  the daunting task of holding the attention  of\r\n\r\nMembers after seven speakers before me.  Therefore, I  intend\r\n\r\nto keep my speech brief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is at a crossroad. As we\r\n\r\nlook back into the history of nation-building, we have indeed\r\n\r\ncome   a   long  way.   We  saw  the  nation  struggled   for\r\n\r\nindependence.  We felt the anguish of Singapore's  separation\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia and we saw the turbulence of racial conflicts.\r\n\r\nWe  enjoyed the unprecedented economic growth and prosperity.\r\n\r\nWe went through the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.\r\n\r\nWe  experienced world economic recession and the emergence of\r\n\r\ninternational terrorism in the new millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our parents had witnessed the birth of our\r\n\r\nnation,  the  struggle it went through  and  the  success  it\r\n\r\nachieved.   They identified readily with the first generation\r\n\r\nleaders who have led them through the early dead years of our\r\n\r\nhistory.   They have developed a strong sense of comradeship.\r\n\r\nThey understand the sacrifices and the price that one has  to\r\n\r\npay  for the security and prosperity that so many of us  have\r\n\r\nenjoyed and taken for granted today.  They can appreciate the\r\n\r\nnecessity  of  building  a strong and  cohesive  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety.  Some of us in our own generation may have  seen  or\r\n\r\nexperienced  part  of that and can relate to  the  issues  of\r\n\r\nconcern to the leadership.  However, when we look at our next\r\n\r\ngeneration, future leaders of our nation, we will  invariably\r\n\r\ncome  away  with  a  sense of anxiety and  uncertainty.   The\r\n\r\nyounger  generation was born and brought up in  a  relatively\r\n\r\nsecure  and prosperous period of our history. They  have  not\r\n\r\nseen  the  turbulence nor the struggle our  nation  has  gone\r\n\r\nthrough.   You can expect quite a different perspective  from\r\n\r\nthe   younger   generation.   Furthermore,   as   we   become\r\n\r\nincreasingly globalised, many Singaporeans will be travelling\r\n\r\noverseas,  and  some  of them may end  up  working  overseas,\r\n\r\nespecially the younger generation and the entrepreneurs.  The\r\n\r\nattraction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  better pay and perceived greater opportunities  in  these\r\n\r\ncountries  may cause some of them to think of migration.   It\r\n\r\nis  therefore  crucial that we deal with the aspirations  and\r\n\r\nexpectations  of our younger generation in order  to  prepare\r\n\r\nthem for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our search for new economic opportunities, we must\r\n\r\nalso  be  mindful  of  the  need  to  strengthen  our  social\r\n\r\ncohesion.   In his speech, the President also mentioned  that\r\n\r\nin  addition  to economic restructuring, the Government  will\r\n\r\nalso focus on promoting social cohesion.  Mr Speaker, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nam  glad  that other than the Economic Review Committee  that\r\n\r\nwas  set  up  to chart the new direction for our economy  and\r\n\r\ndevelop new engines of growth, the Government has also set up\r\n\r\nthe  Remaking  Singapore Committee  to  look  into  the  non-economic aspects of our renewal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, nation building is more than rebuilding the\r\n\r\neconomy.   In fact, to build a nation, we need to start  with\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  people, because our people  are  our  only  real\r\n\r\nasset.   With a strong and committed people, we will then  be\r\n\r\nable  to  build a connected and cohesive society.   And  with\r\n\r\nthat,  we  can  begin to build a progressive  and  prosperous\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to build a Singaporean people, I think three areas\r\n\r\nneed to be looked at.  Firstly, we need to inculcate a strong\r\n\r\nsense   of   belonging.    We  are,   first   and   foremost,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  We may speak different languages  or  practise\r\n\r\ndifferent  religions and traditions, but we are Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nWe  are  all  members of the same family, regardless  of  our\r\n\r\nacademic  or financial achievements.  We are a small  nation.\r\n\r\nWe  need to constantly strive for excellence just to survive.\r\n\r\nHowever, in our pursuit of excellence, it is inevitable  that\r\n\r\nsome  members  of the family may lag behind.   Some  of  them\r\n\r\nwould eventually catch up, but some may not be able to do  so\r\n\r\nfor  various reasons and would feel a sense of despair.  They\r\n\r\nare nonetheless members of the Singapore family.  We need  to\r\n\r\nreassure them that they remain so and there is always a place\r\n\r\nfor them here in their home.  Through the actions of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the society, we must not  label  them  as  a\r\n\r\nburden  or  as  a liability to the nation, but as  an  asset.\r\n\r\nWhile it is critical that we attract foreign talents to  help\r\n\r\nmake  us internationally competitive, we must also be mindful\r\n\r\nto intensify our efforts to nurture and develop local talents\r\n\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I had a meeting with a neighbourhood primary\r\n\r\nschool  principal.  She told me that her school had a  banner\r\n\r\nthat said, \"Every child is a gift to us, taught and cared for\r\n\r\nas  a  gifted  child\".  She wanted to remind  every  teacher,\r\n\r\nevery student and every parent that each child is special and\r\n\r\na  gift  to be treasured regardless of their results.   I  am\r\n\r\nsure students and parents of that school would feel proud  to\r\n\r\nbelong to such a school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we can succeed in making Singaporeans feel that\r\n\r\nthey  are   a  gift to the nation and that we  treasure  them\r\n\r\nregardless  of  their achievements, they in  turn  will  feel\r\n\r\nproud  to be Singaporeans.  We will then have taken the first\r\n\r\nstep towards building a united Singapore people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second thing I believe we must do\r\n\r\nis to inculcate among Singaporeans a sense of responsibility,\r\n\r\nnot  only towards oneself but to fellow Singaporeans, to  the\r\n\r\nsociety and to the nation.  As we push for economic progress,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a risk that some Singaporeans may become  somewhat\r\n\r\nindividualistic, and seek progress at the expense of  others.\r\n\r\nWe  are beginning to see some signs of this among our younger\r\n\r\ngeneration.  If we are to build a cohesive society,  we  will\r\n\r\nneed  to  constantly  remind ourselves that  we  survive  and\r\n\r\nthrive not as individuals but as a collective people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my university where I studied, there was a very\r\n\r\npopular sports event  - boat racing.  Boat racing is  one  of\r\n\r\nthe most demanding team sports.  Other than physical fitness,\r\n\r\ncoordination  and team work are often what give  the  team  a\r\n\r\nwinning  edge.  We are like rowing a boat.  We need  everyone\r\n\r\nin the boat to pull in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe same direction in order to arrive and win as a team.   If\r\n\r\none of us decides to push ahead at the expense of others,  we\r\n\r\nwill  simply go around in circles.  As our economy progresses\r\n\r\nand  our  society matures, income gap is likely to widen  and\r\n\r\nsocial   tension  likely  to  increase.   To  ensure   social\r\n\r\ncohesion, it is necessary to have a safety net to help  those\r\n\r\nwho  fall between the cracks.  However, I think it is equally\r\n\r\nimportant,  if not more important, to strengthen  the  social\r\n\r\nfabric  by  promoting  mutual  help  and  support.    It   is\r\n\r\nparticularly crucial for us to remind our younger  generation\r\n\r\nthat  as  they strive for higher achievements,  they  have  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility towards fellow Singaporeans, especially  those\r\n\r\nwho are not as economically successful.  We need to encourage\r\n\r\ncharity   and  volunteerism  and  to  provide  the  necessary\r\n\r\nframework to facilitate them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important for us to develop a greater\r\n\r\ncapacity  and  tolerance for failures.  There was  a  Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying se pai nai chng kung chi mu, failure is the mother  of\r\n\r\nsuccess.  Indeed, failure is but a stepping stone to  success\r\n\r\nfor  as  long as one continues to try.  One will  truly  fail\r\n\r\nwhen  one  stops  trying.   Our emphasis  on  excellence  and\r\n\r\nachievement might have caused us to be somewhat less tolerant\r\n\r\nfor  failures.  We need to be mindful of the risk of becoming\r\n\r\na  perfectionist  society, be it our  education  system,  our\r\n\r\neconomy  or  our  society at large.  We need  to  consciously\r\n\r\nenlarge  our  tolerance for failures.  We can then  begin  to\r\n\r\nbuild  not just a progressive society but also a responsible,\r\n\r\ncaring and tolerant society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the third area of focus in building a\r\n\r\npeople is to develop a sense of ownership.  Many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nown  a home today, be it a Housing and Development Board flat\r\n\r\nor  private  property.  In fact, quite a number of  them  own\r\n\r\nmore  than  one  property,  and not  just  in  Singapore  but\r\n\r\noverseas as well.  Therefore, property ownership is no longer\r\n\r\nthe sole factor in Singaporeans' minds when they consider the\r\n\r\nissue of national ownership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I travel widely in my private job and stay in hotels\r\n\r\nregularly.   It is clear to me that hotels are not  my  home.\r\n\r\nIf  the  hotel I stay in is poorly managed, I will switch  to\r\n\r\nother  hotels next time.  If the hotel suffers a major crisis\r\n\r\nand  has to shut down, I just move on to another one.  I have\r\n\r\nno  say  in  how the hotel is run and I have no  relationship\r\n\r\nwith  the  hotel.  But my home is not a hotel.   My  home  is\r\n\r\nwhere  my  family is.  My home is where I have a say  in  how\r\n\r\nthings  are  done after consulting my wife,  of  course.   If\r\n\r\nthere is a problem in my home, I do not run away and move  on\r\n\r\nto  the  next home.  I will stay and help solve the  problem,\r\n\r\nbecause I am involved in building the home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not a hotel. It is a home. It is our\r\n\r\nhome.   The  five-star facilities it has do  not  make  it  a\r\n\r\nhome.   It  is  you  and I that make  it  our  home.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore   important  for  us  to  continue   to   encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  in  all  quarters as we  build  our  nation  to\r\n\r\ninvolve  them.   Greater  participation  and  involvement  by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will undoubtedly give them a greater  sense  of\r\n\r\nownership.  When the country needs them, they will  stay  and\r\n\r\nhelp because this is their home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe the starting point to build a\r\n\r\nnation  is  to  build  a  sense  of  belonging,  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and a sense of ownership.  And  the  starting\r\n\r\npoint  of  that process is education.  We take pride  in  the\r\n\r\nacademic  achievements  of  our  students  which  have   been\r\n\r\noutstanding  compared  to many other countries,  even  better\r\n\r\nthan  some of the developed countries.  It is perhaps equally\r\n\r\ncrucial to develop the character of our students, their moral\r\n\r\nstandards  and their value system.  In the early years,  this\r\n\r\nhas  primarily been the task of parents.  Other  than  verbal\r\n\r\ninstructions, parents also serve as role models.  But as  our\r\n\r\nsociety progresses, I am afraid this is fast becoming a  lost\r\n\r\nart.   Many  young  parents today are no longer  equipped  to\r\n\r\nimpart  sound  moral  standards or  value  systems  to  their\r\n\r\nchildren.   In many instances, both parents are  working  and\r\n\r\nthey  spend  little  time with their  children  during  their\r\n\r\nformative  years.  Granted that parents cannot absolve  their\r\n\r\nduty in bringing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  their  children  properly, we  need  to  recognise  their\r\n\r\npractical limitations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps useful for us to revisit the curriculum of\r\n\r\nour  schools  to  see if it is possible to  strengthen  those\r\n\r\ncomponents   relating  to  moral  education   and   character\r\n\r\nbuilding, and to provide more opportunities to allow them  to\r\n\r\ninteract and develop their social skills.  I think pre-school\r\n\r\neducation  in  particular  should  perhaps  focus   more   on\r\n\r\ncharacter  building rather than academic work.   I read  with\r\n\r\ngreat  interest the Ministry of Education's Addendum  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Address  wherein  the  Minister  said  that  his\r\n\r\nMinistry will pay particular attention to curriculum  design,\r\n\r\nteacher  training and regulation in pre-school education.   I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister will take into account the need for greater\r\n\r\nemphasis on character building in its reviews.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In primary and secondary schools, we should perhaps\r\n\r\nconsider  enhancing  the  community  involvement  programmes.\r\n\r\nSome  of  these  programmes may be conducted in collaboration\r\n\r\nwith  selected community and welfare organisations   so  that\r\n\r\nthere  is greater professionalism and more meaningful  focus.\r\n\r\nEffective  and early participation in community and volunteer\r\n\r\nwork  will  allow our students to develop a strong  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility to the community during their formative years,\r\n\r\nwhich ultimately may become the foundation of their character\r\n\r\nas they mature into adulthood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the President has said in his\r\n\r\nAddress,  the world has changed.  We must change  too  if  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  remain relevant.  A good Government and a  cohesive\r\n\r\npeople  are  what brought us here so far.  We  will  need  an\r\n\r\nequally  good Government, different style perhaps,  but  good\r\n\r\nnonetheless  to  lead us forward.  We need an equally  strong\r\n\r\nand   cohesive  people,  different  aspirations  and   dreams\r\n\r\nperhaps,  but cohesive nonetheless as our source of  strength\r\n\r\nwhen we face the challenges and explore the opportunities the\r\n\r\nfuture holds for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I propose to take the break now.

I also welcome  the  President's\r\n\r\nreminder  on  the need to engage all Singaporeans,  including\r\n\r\nthose who disagree with specific Government policies, so long\r\n\r\nas  they  have Singapore's interest at heart.  I  agree  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  monopoly  on wisdom  and  those  who  are  not\r\n\r\nrepresented  in this House or who do not agree with  us  must\r\n\r\nstill have a role to play.  So I would like to encourage  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  come  forward and participate  actively  in\r\n\r\ndebating   policies  and  contributing  ideas.   Cynics   and\r\n\r\nsceptics should dispense with their judgements and allow this\r\n\r\nmaturing phase of our political process to develop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we face serious challenges as we move\r\n\r\nahead.   So  we need to bring everyone on board in our  quest\r\n\r\nfor  better  solutions and ideas.  It is my  belief  that  we\r\n\r\nstand  a  much better chance to succeed if there is a greater\r\n\r\nsense  of involvement and ownership of the changes that  take\r\n\r\nplace  which affect all our lives.  We share a common destiny\r\n\r\nand  whether  or not we reach our destination  rests  in  our\r\n\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I note the President's concern that as\r\n\r\nwe restructure our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomy, there will be dislocations.  And I completely  agree\r\n\r\nwith  him  that we have to intensify efforts to  help  lower-income  and  low-skilled Singaporeans.  In this respect,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance's aim for a modest budget surplus  over\r\n\r\nthis  financial  year so that it could deal with  the  social\r\n\r\nchallenges of economic restructuring and ageing population in\r\n\r\na  sustainable way is greatly welcomed.  This is an important\r\n\r\npolicy  consideration, as I note that the President had  also\r\n\r\nmentioned  that taxes should be kept as light as possible  to\r\n\r\nprovide   incentives   for   corporations   and   high-income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to work hard.  If there are changes, I  do  hope\r\n\r\nthat adequate measures will be put in place to help our lower-income  Singaporeans to adjust.  It is my strong  belief,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  that long-term economic development  is  only\r\n\r\nsustainable if it is also complemented by an effective social\r\n\r\ndevelopment programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most Singaporeans, education and health care are key\r\n\r\nconcerns.   In  this respect, I note in the Addendum  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health that the Ministry intends to introduce  a\r\n\r\nselective  means testing to ensure that health care subsidies\r\n\r\nwhich are targeted for low-income groups actually reach them.\r\n\r\nWhile  I  welcome  this move, as it can weed out  undeserving\r\n\r\ncases,   I  would  also  like  to  advise  caution   in   its\r\n\r\nimplementation so as not to result in a system which is  very\r\n\r\nrigid, and make it difficult for people to enjoy the subsidy.\r\n\r\nMeans  testing of public assistance programmes is a difficult\r\n\r\nissue.   While the intention is to assist those in need,  and\r\n\r\nincome  level is one yardstick, too much procedural  red-tape\r\n\r\ncan  cause  delay and frustration and limits access  to  what\r\n\r\nmany Singaporeans would consider as basic needs.  At the same\r\n\r\ntime, a lot of middle-income Singaporeans also need help,  as\r\n\r\nhealth  care  cost has been rising and medical treatment  can\r\n\r\ncause  a squeeze on their finances as well.  So, quality  and\r\n\r\npricing  of  medical services impact on the accessibility  of\r\n\r\nhealth  care  in  Singapore  and  remain  a  key  concern  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore urge the Ministry of Health to ensure that\r\n\r\nmedical  services continue to be affordable  and  within  the\r\n\r\nmeans  of  the  average Singaporean.   I  also  call  on  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to ensure that all existing hospitals, as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe two new ones that are being built, contain enough C class\r\n\r\nand B2 wards to take care of the needs of the low income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Ministry of Manpower, I support\r\n\r\nits   mission  and  objectives  wholeheartedly.    Tripartite\r\n\r\ncooperation  and industrial harmony have been the cornerstone\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's  industrialisation strategy.  Many  countries\r\n\r\nenvy  our good track record and many have studied our  system\r\n\r\nin  an  attempt  to  duplicate it.   Our  unique  system  has\r\n\r\nfunctioned  well because the Government treats employers  and\r\n\r\ntrade  unions as social partners.  Trade unions are consulted\r\n\r\nnot only on issues affecting workers but also on economic and\r\n\r\nsocial  policies.   This has provided us  with  an  effective\r\n\r\nchannel  to  voice workers' concerns and aspirations  and  to\r\n\r\nplay   a   significant  role  in  Singapore's  progress   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.    If   trade  unions  had   been   ignored   or\r\n\r\nmarginalised, as it is happening in many countries, I am sure\r\n\r\nthat we will have a completely different outcome today.   We,\r\n\r\nin  the  NTUC and the trade unions, will continue to  do  our\r\n\r\npart  to  ensure Singapore's competitiveness, focus on  jobs,\r\n\r\narticulate  workers' concerns and ensure a fair  distribution\r\n\r\nof the rewards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also support the call for a review of our\r\n\r\nemployment regulations to ensure their relevance.  Tremendous\r\n\r\nchanges  are  taking place in the world of work.   Employment\r\n\r\nrelationships are being redefined.  The traditional  lifelong\r\n\r\nemployment model that characterised the industrial era is now\r\n\r\nincreasingly  being  replaced  by  contract,  part-time   and\r\n\r\ntemporary work.  In Japan, about 23% of those employed are in\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of work.  In the Netherlands, it is 37%;  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom, 24%; and in Korea, almost 50%.  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nno  exception although at present the number is still  small.\r\n\r\nA key employment legislation is the Employment Act, which was\r\n\r\npassed   in   1968   during   the   first   phase   of    our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme.  It was one of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmost progressive pieces of legislation of its time.  Many  of\r\n\r\nthe aspects that other countries are grappling with today and\r\n\r\nare  trying  to  include in their labour laws,  causing  much\r\n\r\nindustrial  strife in the process, were already  included  in\r\n\r\nour laws at that time.  Key among these is discipline at work\r\n\r\nand  labour flexibility, but with clear basic protection  for\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst the overall framework of the\r\n\r\nlegislation remains very much relevant today for the  reasons\r\n\r\nI have mentioned, refinements are necessary.  Our economy has\r\n\r\nshifted  from being labour intensive to capital intensive  to\r\n\r\none  which is increasingly knowledge intensive.  One critical\r\n\r\narea of review would clearly have to be the scope of coverage\r\n\r\nof the Employment Act.  There are three issues here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Act makes a distinction between workmen and\r\n\r\nemployees.  But as we can no longer classify jobs  so  neatly\r\n\r\ninto manual and non-manual, the underlying rationale for  the\r\n\r\ndistinction, it will be increasingly difficult to  implement.\r\n\r\nSecondly,   the   present  restriction  which   allows   only\r\n\r\nemployees, that is, non-manual workers earning not more  than\r\n\r\n$1,600  to  benefit under the Act, is unrealistic  as  income\r\n\r\nlevels  have risen over the years, and the Act runs the  risk\r\n\r\nof  covering  an ever shrinking base of workers.   We  should\r\n\r\nwork out a mechanism that will be self-adjusting so that  the\r\n\r\nsalary  ceiling  can move automatically.   Thirdly,  the  Act\r\n\r\ncovers   only  those  employed  under  contract  of  service.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly, there will be more portfolio workers  or  those\r\n\r\nemployed under contract for services.  Such portfolio workers\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  formally  classified  as  employees  but  their\r\n\r\nrelationships with companies retain a major component  of  an\r\n\r\nemployment relationship that is dependent on the user company\r\n\r\nand brings to the contract only their own labour or expertise\r\n\r\nand  nothing  else.  So, even if there is  a  review  of  the\r\n\r\nincome  ceiling,  as more contract or portfolio  workers  are\r\n\r\nemployed,  they will fall outside the ambit of  the  Act  and\r\n\r\nwill  not  have the protection of the Act.  It  is  therefore\r\n\r\nimperative  that we review the scope of this  legislation  to\r\n\r\nensure that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenough numbers of workers are covered under the legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws of many countries extend coverage to all\r\n\r\nworkers,   regardless  of  whether  there  is  an  employment\r\n\r\nrelationship.   In  this respect, the UK's  Trade  Union  and\r\n\r\nLabour  Relations  Consolidated Act of  1992,  for  instance,\r\n\r\ndefines  a worker as someone who is employed under a contract\r\n\r\nof service or a contract for service.  Likewise, the position\r\n\r\nin  Japan  where under both the Labour Standard Law  and  the\r\n\r\nTrade Union Law, a worker is defined as a person who lives on\r\n\r\nhis  wages, salaries or other remuneration, regardless of the\r\n\r\nnature of his employment contract.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of the Employment Act will not be complete\r\n\r\nwithout a review of the other labour legislation as well,  in\r\n\r\nparticular the Trade Unions Act and the Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nAct.   I  call  upon  the  Ministry of Manpower  to  consider\r\n\r\nreviewing these laws as well.  In particular, for the reasons\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier, it will be opportune  to  assess  whether\r\n\r\nthere is a need to restrict the scope of unions' coverage  so\r\n\r\nnarrowly to only those with employment relationships.   As  I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned,  as  more and more people  are  employed  as\r\n\r\ncontract or portfolio workers, we have to look at this aspect\r\n\r\nof  covering them as well, in relation to our social security\r\n\r\nlegislation, in this instance, the CPF Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President's statement that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  protect  the  minority  communities,  their\r\n\r\ncultures and their ways of life is most reassuring.   At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, the President has called upon groups to adjust and\r\n\r\ncompromise  in  order to live harmoniously in a multi-racial,\r\n\r\nmulti-religious society.  This is a timely reminder as events\r\n\r\naround  the  world  show time and again just  how  precarious\r\n\r\nracial relations can be.  Sometimes people of different races\r\n\r\nand  religions that have co-existed peacefully for many years\r\n\r\ncould fall apart when certain events take place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Malay Muslims in Singapore are in many\r\n\r\nways at the crossroads.  Globalisation and modernisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  brought  about  new  opportunities  but  also  cultural\r\n\r\nchanges  that  have  caused some concerns in  the  community,\r\n\r\nfearful that this would erode its values.  There is therefore\r\n\r\na  greater  fall back on religion to provide the ballast  and\r\n\r\ncounter  what are perceived as negative influences.  This  is\r\n\r\nvery  much  like the discussion that has taken place  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  community  and  the strong sense  that  Mandarin  is\r\n\r\ncritical  in ensuring that Chinese Singaporeans retain  their\r\n\r\ncultural  and traditional linkages.  Lest I give an erroneous\r\n\r\nimpression, Sir, let me assure Members that these concerns of\r\n\r\nthe community have not resulted in a withdrawal, rather Malay\r\n\r\nMuslim Singaporeans have participated actively in Singapore's\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and nation-building process and  have  benefited\r\n\r\nfrom  it.    The median monthly income of Malay workers,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  was $954 in 1990, but has increased to  $1,790  in\r\n\r\n2000.   But  I think that it is important that we  understand\r\n\r\nwhat  are  some of the concerns and stresses that affect  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Muslim  community,  so  that  there  will  be  a  more\r\n\r\nmeaningful  and  effective dialogue process when  we  discuss\r\n\r\nissues and formulate responses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malay Muslim community can carve a very strong\r\n\r\nniche for ourselves provided we continue to invest heavily in\r\n\r\neducation and skills upgrading.  A critical factor will be in\r\n\r\ncreating  a conducive home environment where parents  provide\r\n\r\nadequate supervision over their children's activities  and  a\r\n\r\nlearning  environment.  There is clearly  greater  scope  for\r\n\r\nparents,  schools, Ministries and organisations to  cooperate\r\n\r\non this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an equally important issue that we must focus on is\r\n\r\nthe  impact  of the economic restructuring on Malay  workers.\r\n\r\nAs  there are more Malay workers in the lower end jobs and in\r\n\r\ncertain  sectors, such as manufacturing, Malay  workers  have\r\n\r\nbeen affected quite badly as a result of the recent downturn,\r\n\r\nand  will  continue to do so as the economy restructures  and\r\n\r\ngoes  into  even  more  higher value-added  activities.   The\r\n\r\nsituation  will  worsen if Malay workers fail  to  seize  the\r\n\r\nopportunity now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand seriously upgrade our skills and qualification level.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  bear in mind that even after the economy  recovers,\r\n\r\nold  jobs  will  not return.  New jobs will be created  which\r\n\r\nrequire  new  skills, aptitudes and qualifications.   Even  a\r\n\r\nsimple  manufacturing job today will require the ability  for\r\n\r\nworkers to read English and perhaps some Mathematics as well.\r\n\r\nMOM's  statistics have shown that, on average, those  without\r\n\r\nskills find it more difficult and take a longer time to  find\r\n\r\nanother  job.  If Malay workers do not want to end  up  doing\r\n\r\nthe kind of jobs that are currently being done by work permit\r\n\r\nholders,  then  we must treat the President's  message  as  a\r\n\r\nstrong  wake  up  call  for  the community  to  urgently  and\r\n\r\nimmediately  get  into action to prepare  ourselves  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the economy itself is undergoing rapid\r\n\r\nchanges.  From now on, the race will assume a completely  new\r\n\r\ndimension.  It is no longer even a brisk walk but we have  to\r\n\r\nactually  run  in  order to achieve not a  higher  level  but\r\n\r\nperhaps  even a lower level of growth, compared  to  previous\r\n\r\nyears.  This is the real challenge for all Singaporeans.  The\r\n\r\nPresident's   Address  has  highlighted   many   issues   and\r\n\r\nchallenges.  I would like to urge all Singaporeans  to  study\r\n\r\nthese  carefully and consider the impact on Singapore and  on\r\n\r\nour  lives.  They should guide us as we plan and prepare  for\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I wish to call upon all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to rally together, stand united.   Although  we\r\n\r\nmay  have  different  views  and  approaches,  we  should  be\r\n\r\nprepared to defend what we hold sacrosanct and dear to us  as\r\n\r\nan  independent nation - values, such as meritocracy,  multi-racialism and help and support for the poor and less able.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion of thanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Education and Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to add my voice to the\r\n\r\nchorus   of  thanks  to  the  President.   He  has   reminded\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  that times have changed and we  must  adapt  to\r\n\r\nsurvive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears that change spares no one. Take me, for\r\n\r\nexample.   This  time  last year, I  would  have  been  in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  chamber.   No doubt, the operating  theatre  would\r\n\r\nhave been less august, but equally bright.  I would have been\r\n\r\ncomfortable  and confident, the environment predictable,  the\r\n\r\npatient  blissfully asleep, while I did what had to be  done.\r\n\r\nLittle  could I guess that within a few months, I would  have\r\n\r\nto  switch  from grappling with the problems of  patients  to\r\n\r\nsolving the nation's woes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister said that he would throw us, new\r\n\r\noffice  holders,  into the deep end, I had not  realised  the\r\n\r\nfull  implications, neither the extent nor the  pace  of  his\r\n\r\nintent.  Barely two weeks after agreeing to be in office  and\r\n\r\nstill operating on humans, I mean, the waves flowed fast  and\r\n\r\nfurious  -  the Jobs Task Force, an unemployment high  of  15\r\n\r\nyears    and    climbing,   100,000   unemployed,    economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring, terrorism within our borders, racial  harmony,\r\n\r\ntudung,  water,  frictions with our  neighbouring  countries,\r\n\r\nremake  Singapore, review our educational institutions.   All\r\n\r\nin a day's work?  Not quite.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the President has said, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The next few years will present us with the most severe\r\n\r\nchallenge  since  independence.  Singapore is  at  a  turning\r\n\r\npoint.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I chose the change. But I can empathise with those\r\n\r\nwhose change was neither invited nor welcomed, who had change\r\n\r\nfoisted  rudely upon them.  It must indeed be unsettling  for\r\n\r\nmany  to  be out of job, to feel that they are no  longer  in\r\n\r\ncontrol  of their destiny, to be unable to provide for  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.   How do we help Singaporeans respond to  and  cope\r\n\r\nwith  this  change  and more to come?   In  his  Address  and\r\n\r\nAddenda, the President has wisely outlined the challenges and\r\n\r\nhow  we must respond to continue to thrive and prosper in  an\r\n\r\nuncertain world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that all of us will have to dig deeper\r\n\r\nwithin  ourselves if we are to meet these challenges.  Permit\r\n\r\nme   to   use  a  medical  analogy.   The  bug  that   causes\r\n\r\ntuberculosis is endemic, that is, it is always present.   But\r\n\r\nnot all those who are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexposed  will  get tuberculosis.  Those that do get  infected\r\n\r\nare  more  likely  to be those with a weakened  constitution.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  in  an  Intensive Care Unit,  some  patients  are\r\n\r\ntreated  with  every known antibiotic but will still  succumb\r\n\r\nbecause they have lost their innate immunity.  Nature teaches\r\n\r\nus  that each individual must develop his own set of survival\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, our past successes may have created\r\n\r\na  sterile  environment, such that when  exposed  to  a  germ\r\n\r\nattack,  some  Singaporeans may develop full-blown  pneumonia\r\n\r\nrather than a self-limiting infection.  The last time we  had\r\n\r\na protracted unemployment of this magnitude was 15 years ago.\r\n\r\nSo  it would be quite natural for some Singaporeans and their\r\n\r\nchildren  who live in such an environment to expect  lifelong\r\n\r\nemployment.   Just  a  year ago, we had two  jobs  for  every\r\n\r\nworker.   Now,  we have three jobless looking  for  one  job.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  first launched the Economic Downturn Relief  Scheme\r\n\r\n(EDRS)  last  year, I had quite a few constituents  who  were\r\n\r\nyoung and able-bodied, who requested for the EDRS but had not\r\n\r\neven  put  themselves on any job search list.  My  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders  and I decided that we would not succumb to the  soft\r\n\r\napproach.  It would have been like giving steroids  when  you\r\n\r\nmake  the patient feel good but reduce his immunity.  Doctors\r\n\r\nuse  steroids  judiciously, even though, to  many,  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmiracle drug.  Ask the wheezing asthmatic or the patient with\r\n\r\nrheumatoid arthritis with painful joints.  To these  patients\r\n\r\nsteroids alleviate discomfort and suffering.  But there is  a\r\n\r\ndownside.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steroids also weaken a person's immune system so that\r\n\r\nthey  are  less  able  to  mount  appropriate  responses   to\r\n\r\ninfection.  An appendicitis, for example, becomes a  critical\r\n\r\nevent   because  the  steroids  prevent  the   patient   from\r\n\r\ndisplaying early warning signs of fever and pain, until it is\r\n\r\ntoo   late  and  the  infection  overwhelming  and  systemic.\r\n\r\nSteroids  also weaken the bones so that prolonged  users  are\r\n\r\nprone to fractures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the parallel between liberal administration of\r\n\r\nsteroids and the indiscriminate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuse  of assistance is too close for comfort.  Both can  erode\r\n\r\nthe  basic  strength and structure on which  our  health  and\r\n\r\nprosperity were built.  We decided, my grassroots leaders and\r\n\r\nI,  to  award the EDRS only to those who have signed  up  for\r\n\r\ntraining or looking for jobs.  By the beginning of this year,\r\n\r\nthings  improved and the message got through, such that  most\r\n\r\nof  them  were  at  least on the job bank when  applying  for\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe we need to go further and invoke the\r\n\r\nspirit  of resilience and self-sufficiency that our  pioneers\r\n\r\nhad  when  they built this nation, and if I may  add  against\r\n\r\nmuch  greater odds.  I have two such grassroots leaders  that\r\n\r\ncome  to mind who exemplify this spirit.  One is in his  mid-50s,  survived and prospered by selling provisions to  hotels\r\n\r\nand  the  like,  speaks mostly Hokkien.  A minor  celebration\r\n\r\nerupts in my constituency when we can persuade him to put  on\r\n\r\nshoes  rather  than his Japanese slippers.  Regales  me  with\r\n\r\nstories  of  how heavy a load he can carry on his  shoulders,\r\n\r\neven  though he can afford to hire others to do  it.   He  is\r\n\r\nwealthy  but chooses to live in Toa Payoh where he has  lived\r\n\r\nfor  over  half a century.  Walks up to his flat rather  than\r\n\r\ntakes  the  lift  for exercise.  Supports my meet-the-people-session  (MPS) faithfully by his physical presence  since  he\r\n\r\ncannot draft the letter.   But came election time last  year,\r\n\r\nhe  was  sweating  away  putting my posters  up.   Picture  a\r\n\r\nmillionaire putting up my plywood posters!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, do not misunderstand me. I am not extolling this\r\n\r\nman's  virtues  because he helps me during the  election.   I\r\n\r\npraise  him  because he knows that there can  be  dignity  in\r\n\r\nlabour.   Sir, this is a man that is unschooled and the  less\r\n\r\nenlightened might even say uncouth.  But I have more  respect\r\n\r\nfor  him  than  most  because he has made  good  despite  his\r\n\r\nshortcomings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is a man in his 60s, another provision shop\r\n\r\nowner.   We  have many of those.  About a month ago,  he  had\r\n\r\ndifficulty breathing.  His lung burst, probably\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom scarring due to an old infection.  So when I visited him\r\n\r\nin  Tan Tock Seng Hospital, he had a tube sticking out of his\r\n\r\nleft  chest to drain out the air that escaped.  I asked  him,\r\n\r\n\"Do  you  know  what the doctors are going to do?\"   He  said\r\n\r\nstoically   and  matter-of-factly,  \"Yes.   They  used   some\r\n\r\nchemical  or powder to seal up the hole or perform  surgery.\"\r\n\r\nTwo  weeks  after his discharge, he is back  at  my  MPS  and\r\n\r\nhelping me as usual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these people bounce back because they have an\r\n\r\ninnate  resilience  of  spirit born  of  adversity.   Do  not\r\n\r\nmisunderstand  me  again!  I am not advocating  a  return  to\r\n\r\nmenial labour.  The world and our population have changed too\r\n\r\ndrastically  for that model to be sustainable.  80%  of  each\r\n\r\ncohort now has at least a post-secondary education.  We  have\r\n\r\neducated  them  well  but we must do more  to  inculcate  the\r\n\r\nattitude of self-sufficiency, endeavour and enterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By whim of geography and capricious twist of history, we\r\n\r\nwere landed up with 680 sq km of land after reclamation,  and\r\n\r\neach  other.  Lifelong learning applies to everyone.  Let  me\r\n\r\ngive  you a personal anecdote.  I have always struggled  with\r\n\r\nmy  second language.  Chinese has been my bane.  When I  went\r\n\r\ninto  medical school, I was quite glad to be rid  of  it.   I\r\n\r\nthought,  as a doctor, I would use less.  When I  did  indeed\r\n\r\nbecome a doctor, I found that most patients spoke Hokkien  or\r\n\r\nMandarin and to get a consistent and proper history, I had to\r\n\r\nspeak  Mandarin.   When I went into private  practice,  there\r\n\r\nwere  Indonesian patients who spoke Chinese.  So there I  was\r\n\r\nspeaking half the time in Chinese.  Then, of course, I became\r\n\r\na  Member of Parliament and had to make speeches in Mandarin.\r\n\r\nSo there I was studying hanyu pinyin listening to the correct\r\n\r\ndiction with CDAC's help.  And I thought what a bitter  irony\r\n\r\nor  bitter  twist  life deals to me.  When  you  are  bad  in\r\n\r\nsomething and you have to learn again, your occupation forces\r\n\r\nyou  to  do  it,  I  was getting a bit paranoid.   I  thought\r\n\r\nperhaps the PAP particularly put me in Toa Payoh to brush  up\r\n\r\nmy  Chinese.   When that did not work, they  put  me  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education.  So I thought before  this  got  any\r\n\r\nfurther, I better brush\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  my  Chinese and get tuition.  So here I am, aged  44  and\r\n\r\ntaking Chinese tuition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lifelong learning is for everyone. The road ahead\r\n\r\nis uncertain for our people.  Business cycles are shorter and\r\n\r\nlikely   to   be   more   disruptive.    Globalisation    and\r\n\r\ninterconnectivity  have created rapid  response  times.   The\r\n\r\njust-in-time  concept   applies  both  to  manufacturing  and\r\n\r\nservice  sectors.   I  read recently  that  Starbucks  has  a\r\n\r\nquality target based on what is known as the \"Order to  Froth\r\n\r\nTime\".  This is the time it takes for a customer to give  his\r\n\r\norder  and  for him to receive or to drink the froth  of  his\r\n\r\ncoffee.  Their software tracks this in all their branches and\r\n\r\nmobilise  their  workforce to meet this  demand  and  deliver\r\n\r\ncoffee  within  a prescribed interval.  Sir,  the  \"Order  to\r\n\r\nFroth Time\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the aftermath and havoc following September 11,\r\n\r\ninventories  were slashed with astonishing speed  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  rapid assimilation of information.  Correspondingly, the\r\n\r\ndownsizing   of   companies  must  have  followed   just   as\r\n\r\nresponsively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this brave new world, employment\r\n\r\ncycles are likely to be disruptive and discontinuous.   While\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  do everything within its  power  to  assist\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, each must take personal responsibility for  his\r\n\r\nor her well-being.  Government can help the citizens turn the\r\n\r\ncorner.  But without an intrinsic level of resistance,  minor\r\n\r\ninfections can become fatal.  We should help our people  face\r\n\r\nthese  challenges squarely without the use of steroids.   Our\r\n\r\npioneers  succeeded  with this approach  and  so  shall  this\r\n\r\ngeneration.    Within  the  Jobs  Task  Force,   we   decided\r\n\r\ncollectively to speak plainly to those unemployed and  risked\r\n\r\nthe  accusation of being insensitive.  I am happy  to  report\r\n\r\nthat,  as a result of this strategy, our job placements  have\r\n\r\ngone up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have understood, and now about 1,000 a\r\n\r\nmonth are finding new jobs through the CareerLinks at MOM and\r\n\r\nCDCs.   We must continue to cultivate strength in our people,\r\n\r\nto  give  them  respect  and help  them  survive  and  indeed\r\n\r\nprosper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this then mean the Government can take a reduced\r\n\r\nrole?  On the contrary, adversity provides us the opportunity\r\n\r\nto work harder.  The Government must intensify our search for\r\n\r\nnew  growth areas.  We must continue to invest in our  people\r\n\r\nand  capitalise  on  opportunities when  the  global  economy\r\n\r\nrecovers.   But,  above  all,  we,  this  generation  of  new\r\n\r\npolitical  leaders, must win by their own merit  and  effort,\r\n\r\ntrust  and confidence.  Almost 75% of voters reaffirmed  last\r\n\r\nOctober their belief in us to govern.  But for me, this trust\r\n\r\nwas  vicariously  obtained.  Did the  people  vote  for  this\r\n\r\nGovernment so resoundingly because of the new faces and their\r\n\r\ngreat  abilities?  I would be the greater fool if I chose  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that.   No, they did so because the  party  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment before me has never broken faith with the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am acutely aware that my position is obtained through\r\n\r\nthe  sacrifices and efforts of those who preceded me.  I reap\r\n\r\nwhere others have toiled.  How have previous Governments  won\r\n\r\nthe  explicit  trust  of  its  citizens?   Through  sustained\r\n\r\nhonesty and consistency.  It never promised what it could not\r\n\r\ngive  and accomplished only what it could promise.  It  never\r\n\r\nwent for soft options, believed that its people could rise to\r\n\r\nthe challenges and, as a result, prospered.  This trust is  a\r\n\r\nsource  of  our nation's strength.  This recession will  pass\r\n\r\nbut there will be another.  The tudung issue will revisit  us\r\n\r\nin a different form and religion constantly seeking to divide\r\n\r\nand  weaken us.  But the trust that exists between us and the\r\n\r\npeople  is  that which sustains us.  When that is  shattered,\r\n\r\nall else is lost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is a marathon not a sprint, Senior\r\n\r\nMinister says.  I take heed.  Learn how they did it,  I  tell\r\n\r\nmyself,  more  so than what they did.  What have  I  learned?\r\n\r\nYou  see,  just as I expect each Singaporean to take personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  his well-being,  I  must  be  personally\r\n\r\naccountable to the people.  What then is the ethos with which\r\n\r\nI  hope to serve?  Of what do I remind myself?  Expect people\r\n\r\nto  come  to you with problems.  That is what you got elected\r\n\r\nfor and appointed to do.  Remember your oath\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore the President.  Be a servant, but do not diminish your\r\n\r\npeople  or your office as a Member of Parliament.  Be  honest\r\n\r\nand  upfront.   The  patient never got better  through  empty\r\n\r\nplatitudes;  neither will the nation.  Be diligent.   Get  to\r\n\r\nthe  root  of  the  problem.  Ask and  listen.   Do  not  get\r\n\r\nbedazzled  by  brilliance and be wary of  those  who  try  to\r\n\r\nbefuddle you.  Diagnose wrongs and say plainly what you  need\r\n\r\nto  do.  Do not promise more than what you give, but when you\r\n\r\nsay  something, see it through.  If the problem needs  fixing\r\n\r\nand  surgery  is  required, for goodness  sake,  get  a  good\r\n\r\nanaesthetist to minimise the pain.  You are not  perfect  and\r\n\r\nwill  make  mistakes.  Admit them, correct the  complications\r\n\r\nand move on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I started by saying how change can be\r\n\r\nunsettling.   Despite  these difficult  times,  I  have  been\r\n\r\nstrangely calm.  I am confident that we will emerge  stronger\r\n\r\nand  more  united.  My confidence and strength come from  the\r\n\r\npeople's  trust,  the  commitment  of  my  comrades  and   my\r\n\r\ncaptains'  ability.  In my captains, I have only  seen  care,\r\n\r\nnever  fear.  Their calmness and collectedness have  inspired\r\n\r\nme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am, by training, not a poet. I cut better than I\r\n\r\nspeak.    But   since  we  are  encouraging  creativity   and\r\n\r\ninnovation in our schools, I thought it wise, or foolish,  to\r\n\r\nlead  by  example and close with a poem.  At the very  worst,\r\n\r\nboth  you  and  I will know that I am completely  lacking  in\r\n\r\nliterary skills.  Here I am, through the sacrifices of  those\r\n\r\nbefore  me, sacred trust received, honour and duty conceived.\r\n\r\nOn  my  plate of service, offerings of diligence,  compassion\r\n\r\nand  integrity.  Tis I have.  Nothing more, nothing less  you\r\n\r\nshall  receive.  Tis enough I hope.  Must be enough, I  wish.\r\n\r\nHere I am, stand or fall with me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this time last year, I would have been\r\n\r\nin a different chamber, and the poorer for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Matthias Yao Chih):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nMotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are signs that our economy is bottoming out. We\r\n\r\nmay see recovery in the second half of this year.  We are out\r\n\r\nof  a crisis situation.  But we may well go into a crisis  if\r\n\r\nwe are slow in reacting to the changes around us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current crisis in Argentina's financial system is\r\n\r\ninstructive.  After a period of hyper-inflation in the 1980s,\r\n\r\nArgentina adopted a currency board and pegged the peso to the\r\n\r\nUS  dollar.   This  brought  down the  inflation  rate  to  a\r\n\r\ncomfortable  level.   For several years, Argentina's  economy\r\n\r\ngrew strongly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the world is not static. In 1994, Mexico entered\r\n\r\nthe  North  American  Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA).   Almost\r\n\r\nimmediately,  exports from Mexico into the US  boomed.   This\r\n\r\nresulted in strong growth for Mexico.  Before 1994, the total\r\n\r\nGDP  of  Mexico was only half that of Brazil's in  US  dollar\r\n\r\nterms.  Today, Mexico's GDP is bigger than Brazil's.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of keen competition from Mexico and the fallout\r\n\r\nof  the  Asian  financial crisis, Brazil had to  devalue  its\r\n\r\ncurrency  in  1999.   That  put pressure  on  Argentina,  but\r\n\r\nArgentina  kept to its currency peg.  Exports suffered,  debt\r\n\r\nmounted and the financial system collapsed.  Of course, there\r\n\r\nare  also  other  contributing  factors.   But  the  changing\r\n\r\ndynamics  of  trade  and capital flow external  to  Argentina\r\n\r\nbecame a key cause of her internal problems.  A solution that\r\n\r\nworked for them for a while failed to work any more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Argentina is far away from here. But can there be\r\n\r\na parallel scenario in our part of the world?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China has entered the WTO. What is the impact on\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia?   The  President said in  his  Address  that\r\n\r\n\"China's low costs, abundant talent and huge domestic  market\r\n\r\nare  attracting  MNCs  to relocate  plants  to  China.   Good\r\n\r\nquality  but  cheaper  Chinese products  are  flooding  world\r\n\r\nmarkets.    Adapting  to  China's  emergence   and   economic\r\n\r\ntransformation will pose a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajor   challenge   for   many  Asian  countries,   including\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does all this mean to our workers? To see for\r\n\r\nthemselves,  several  groups  of  trade  union  leaders  have\r\n\r\nvisited  China  in  recent  years.   They  visited  companies\r\n\r\nlocated  in  Beijing, Suzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen and  Xiamen.\r\n\r\nThey  spoke  to  managers, union officials, factory  workers,\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers  and shopkeepers.  They came home impressed  by\r\n\r\nthe  focus,  the  hunger and the confidence  of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before their trips, some thought that Chinese workers\r\n\r\nwere  not very productive.  They discovered that the  Chinese\r\n\r\nworkers  were  highly  educated and  well  trained,  and  the\r\n\r\nmonthly  salary was just the equivalent of our own employers'\r\n\r\nCPF contribution in Singapore.  Some thought that the Chinese\r\n\r\nproducts  might  not be very good.  They  discovered  in  one\r\n\r\nSingapore-owned factory in China that the tools and precision\r\n\r\ndie  used by the workers in Singapore were made by the  China\r\n\r\nfactory,  not  the  other way round.  Some thought  that  the\r\n\r\npublic  toilets  had  no doors or flushing  system  and  they\r\n\r\nprepared  themselves psychologically before they went.   They\r\n\r\nwere  surprised  by 5-star toilets that had  TV  screens  all\r\n\r\naround on the walls showing CNN broadcasts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The union leaders who visited China now understand why\r\n\r\ncompanies want to relocate there.  They are worried  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  lose  more jobs to China.  Yes, they are  worried,  but\r\n\r\nthey are not defeated.  They have all come back with a firmer\r\n\r\nresolve  to urge their fellow workers to retrain and  upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves  so  that we can all float on the moving  tide  of\r\n\r\nglobal economic change, and not sink under its currents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem our workers face is serious, and will remain\r\n\r\nserious.   There were 25,000 retrenchments last year.   There\r\n\r\nwill  be  more  to come, at least in the first half  of  this\r\n\r\nyear.   The nature of retrenchments is changing.  Last  year,\r\n\r\npoor business accounted for 44% of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nretrenchments  in  the  unionised companies.   In  the  first\r\n\r\nquarter of this year, this has dropped to just 18%.  Now, the\r\n\r\nmost    common   reason   for   retrenchment   is    business\r\n\r\nrestructuring,  which  includes  downsizing  and  relocation.\r\n\r\nLast   year,   restructuring  accounted  for  only   32%   of\r\n\r\nretrenchments.  In the first three months of this  year,  the\r\n\r\npercentage has shot up to 59%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More restructuring and relocation will be carried out,\r\n\r\nwhether  we like it or not.  We cannot dictate that investors\r\n\r\nmust  come  to Singapore and stay here.  We can only  attract\r\n\r\nthem to come here by offering to them what they need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the companies do not relocate, old industries\r\n\r\ndie and new industries take their place.  Remember we used to\r\n\r\nhave  factories making typewriters here?  They are all  gone.\r\n\r\nSoon, the factories making TV picture tubes will also go,  to\r\n\r\nbe   replaced   by   those   making  thin-screen   TV   sets.\r\n\r\nTechnological change will cause many more industries to  rise\r\n\r\nand fall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen to our workers in these circumstances?\r\n\r\nIf  we are complacent, if we are slow to react, if we hang on\r\n\r\nto  the  old  solutions hoping that they will solve  our  new\r\n\r\nproblems, we will not be able to keep the good jobs here  and\r\n\r\ncreate  new ones.  If our workers do not take full  advantage\r\n\r\nof  the  opportunities  to  learn and  retrain,  it  will  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  them to get out of work  that  is  no  longer\r\n\r\ncompetitive into new growth industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is growing not by staying still. It is\r\n\r\nundertaking a huge restructuring programme.  Its workers  are\r\n\r\nadapting swiftly to the change.  We cannot afford to be  left\r\n\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address and the Addenda from the various\r\n\r\nMinistries  set out the challenges we face and the  direction\r\n\r\nwe  should  take.  Our workers, employers and the  Government\r\n\r\nmust work hand-in-hand together to make our plans succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the Motion by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMember for Marine Parade GRC absolutely and completely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, in his Address, touched on many aspects\r\n\r\nof the things that we are facing today, and it is quite clear\r\n\r\nthat  we  are at a crossroad.  We are facing a great deal  of\r\n\r\nchange.   The  only  question is, in  Singapore,  how  do  we\r\n\r\nrespond  to this change?  Well, for those of you who  studied\r\n\r\nin  the  1970s, there is a Billy Ocean song \"When  the  going\r\n\r\ngets  tough, the tough gets going\", and that is  what  we  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  must be like.  We must be able to respond  to  the\r\n\r\nchanges  that  face us today and to be able  to  find  a  new\r\n\r\nbalance to deal with the changed circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three areas I would like to raise in respect\r\n\r\nof  how  we  can change.  The first is changing our mindsets.\r\n\r\nIn  many  ways, we in Singapore are the victims  of  our  own\r\n\r\nsuccess.   We have come from a Third-World country  that  was\r\n\r\npoor  and had a lot of low-income people, to a country  which\r\n\r\nis  affluent in the region.  What has happened as a result is\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans, especially young Singaporeans, have taken\r\n\r\nsuccess and economic prosperity for granted.  That, in  turn,\r\n\r\nresults  in a certain complacency of thinking and  a  feeling\r\n\r\nthat  there will always be jobs there, there will  always  be\r\n\r\ncomfortable situations and circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But modern Singapore did not come into existence just\r\n\r\nlike  that.  If we think about it, what are we?  A very small\r\n\r\nred  dot, or so we are told, with no natural resources.   The\r\n\r\nonly thing that we have is our people.   The making of modern\r\n\r\nSingapore is very much an act of will.  It was an act of will\r\n\r\nof  a small group of people who sat down and said, \"These are\r\n\r\nthe overwhelming odds, but we will make it.\"  And we stand at\r\n\r\na   very  similar  crossroad  today,  in  slightly  different\r\n\r\ncircumstances  where we are a bit more  affluent.    But  the\r\n\r\nchallenge  is  exactly the same.  It is how to overcome  odds\r\n\r\nthat   are  put  before  us.   And  in  order  to  do   that,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans today need to have a certain mental toughness, a\r\n\r\ncertain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresilience and the ability to overcome the odds that face us.\r\n\r\nWe must not back down in the face of difficult circumstances.\r\n\r\nWe  must  be,  really, like bamboos:  firmly  rooted  in  our\r\n\r\nconstitutional  principles, but able to bend with  the  wind.\r\n\r\nWe do not break.  We bend but we stay firm.  And that is what\r\n\r\nwe need in the modern Singaporean mindset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President John F Kennedy once famously said, \"Ask not\r\n\r\nwhat your country can do for you but what you can do for your\r\n\r\ncountry.\"  I do not agree entirely.  I think there is no good\r\n\r\nreason  why  a Singaporean cannot ask what the PAP Government\r\n\r\ncan  do  for him.  The PAP Government says it can do lots  of\r\n\r\nthings,  so  by  all means ask.  But, at the same  time,  the\r\n\r\nSingaporean must also ask himself or herself \"What can  I  do\r\n\r\nto  help  myself  and  what  can  I  do  to  help  others  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?\"   It  is a two-way street.  It is  not  just  the\r\n\r\nburden  of the Government, it is not just the burden  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistries.   It  is a challenge that faces  all  of  us  and\r\n\r\nsomething which all of us work and pull together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the subject of employment and how we can\r\n\r\nchange  mindsets  here, there is a need  to  change  mindsets\r\n\r\nbecause,  for  some employees whose jobs have gone,  I  think\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  accept  that these jobs  are  gone  and  will\r\n\r\nprobably never come back.  Not in the same form.  So what the\r\n\r\nemployee has to do is to be able, ready and willing to try an\r\n\r\nalternative  employment.   I  hear,  for  example,  from  the\r\n\r\nCentral CDC that someone in Bukit Merah was offered a job  in\r\n\r\nMarine Parade but did not want to go there because it was too\r\n\r\nfar.   In a situation like that, it is very difficult to  say\r\n\r\nto that person \"I can give you financial assistance\", because\r\n\r\nthat  person has the option to earn.  So we do need  changing\r\n\r\nmindsets on the part of employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, there are some people who are\r\n\r\nwilling to work but cannot find work, and this is because the\r\n\r\nemployers  do  not  change their mindsets.   There  are  many\r\n\r\nemployers out there who do not want to employ people in their\r\n\r\n40s\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  50s  because they feel that they are old,  difficult  to\r\n\r\nretrain and simply would not take them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met a woman in my constituency the other day who had\r\n\r\nbeen looking for a job.  She had applied to the CDC, she  had\r\n\r\ngone for an interview, but in the end, they did not want  her\r\n\r\nbecause  she  was too old. She had been turned down  in  some\r\n\r\nother  applications that she had made.  And what she said  to\r\n\r\nme  was, \"What is there for someone like me?  The only  thing\r\n\r\nthat I can do now is to sit here and wait to die.\"  She is in\r\n\r\nher  late  50s.   I think that was one of the saddest  things\r\n\r\nthat  I ever heard.  I would do something and try to see what\r\n\r\nI  can do to give that woman a job or to find one.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  difficult thing for people in that situation when  they\r\n\r\nare honestly looking, honestly wanting but cannot find a job.\r\n\r\nIn  this kind of situation, what we need to do is to try  and\r\n\r\nsee  whether there is something out there for people who fall\r\n\r\nwithin this age group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I can think of is this. There are many young\r\n\r\npeople  who do not have the time to do their domestic chores,\r\n\r\nsimply because they have a lot of work.  It is difficult  for\r\n\r\nthem  to do grocery shopping, find the time to do the ironing\r\n\r\nor,  in  some cases, just to do cooking at home.  But you  do\r\n\r\nhave  a  lot of the aunties in the HDB areas who are able  to\r\n\r\ncook, able to provide ironing services and who can help  with\r\n\r\npurchase of groceries.  But the only thing you need to do  is\r\n\r\nto ensure that there is some kind of quality control.  What I\r\n\r\nthink  the  CDCs could do is, perhaps, help bridge  this  gap\r\n\r\nbetween the demand and the supply and hopefully, come up with\r\n\r\na sort of training programme for some of these ladies who are\r\n\r\nin their late 40s or 50s, who are willing to provide domestic\r\n\r\nservices for which they can earn a certain amount.  At  least\r\n\r\nif they provide these services, where there is a demand, they\r\n\r\ncan  earn  and have a feeling of self-respect, and a  feeling\r\n\r\nthat  they  are contributing and able to stand on their  own.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  first  change  I  would  advocate  -  changing\r\n\r\nmindsets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is changing traditional attitudes. In this\r\n\r\nrespect, I have found in my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMPS  that there are many poor income families who come to  me\r\n\r\nand yet have many children, and you can just see that this is\r\n\r\na  cycle  of  poverty  because  the  parents  are  poor,  the\r\n\r\nchildren's education is neglected and the children are  going\r\n\r\nto  grow up poor and are not going to be able to advance  and\r\n\r\nprogress.   The  key to this is education.  It  is  extremely\r\n\r\nimportant.   And  in  this  regard,  I  would  also  strongly\r\n\r\nadvocate  education for the girls.  I think across the  board\r\n\r\nand certainly for some of the minority communities, education\r\n\r\nfor the girls may not be considered as important as it is for\r\n\r\nthe  boys  simply because there is the traditional perception\r\n\r\nof  a woman's role in society which is that, ultimately,  one\r\n\r\nday,  she will meet her Prince Charming who will provide  for\r\n\r\nher and be able to look after her from the day of marriage to\r\n\r\nthe  day  she dies.  Unfortunately, it does not quite  happen\r\n\r\nlike that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many women out there who either get divorced\r\n\r\nor  are  victims of domestic violence or, at  some  stage  in\r\n\r\ntheir  lives, are not able to fend for themselves.   I  think\r\n\r\neducation for women at all levels is very important.   It  is\r\n\r\nthe  one  single  defence that a woman has  against  poverty,\r\n\r\nagainst being dependent, against the kind of vicissitudes  in\r\n\r\nlife.   It  is  important for women to  have  the  option  of\r\n\r\nfinancial independence.  If you do not want to exercise  that\r\n\r\noption and if you wish to be a homemaker, that is fine.   But\r\n\r\nthere may be circumstances when you are not so fortunate, and\r\n\r\nin that situation, you do need to have that option. Education\r\n\r\nfor women is very important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On traditional attitudes, there are also the stresses\r\n\r\nand strains in Singapore faced by professional working women.\r\n\r\nLet  me  tell  you a story that illustrates the  point  I  am\r\n\r\ntrying to make.  Somewhere out there in Singapore, there is a\r\n\r\nlittle  boy  and  he  is  brought up,  as  in  all  immigrant\r\n\r\nsocieties,  because we want our children to  have  the  best,\r\n\r\neither his mother would wash his plate, make his bed or if he\r\n\r\nis  more affluent, the maid will do it.  He is brought up  to\r\n\r\nhave  someone to look after him, always taking  care  of  the\r\n\r\ndomestic chores and he is socially conditioned to expect that\r\n\r\nthis is going to be done for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim and chances are that if it is a woman who is doing it for\r\n\r\nhim, then he is going to have that expectation in life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere out there, there is a little girl and she has\r\n\r\nbeen socially conditioned by her parents that she must get an\r\n\r\neducation, she must become an entrepreneur and she must get a\r\n\r\ngood  job  later on in life.  And one day, they are going  to\r\n\r\nmeet.   Then  you  know  what happens when  the  irresistible\r\n\r\nobjects meet the immovable force because they have completely\r\n\r\ndifferent  expectations.   We  are  having  more   women   in\r\n\r\nSingapore who are being more educated.  Their aspirations are\r\n\r\ndifferent from the generation of women before them.  But,  at\r\n\r\nthe same time, we need to understand that there are pressures\r\n\r\non  them  because  they are expected by  the  husband,  their\r\n\r\nmother,  their mother-in-law, to also, in addition to holding\r\n\r\ndown a job, take care of the children.  What we must seek  to\r\n\r\ndo  is to find a new balance and to understand that parenting\r\n\r\nand  family are a shared responsibility and you need to allow\r\n\r\nthem  some space in order to be able to achieve all of  their\r\n\r\naspirations which, in many cases, is to be able  to  work  as\r\n\r\nwell as to have a family.  That is something where we need  a\r\n\r\nchange in traditional attitudes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to the next point where I think we could also do\r\n\r\nsome change and this is in housing policy.  By and large,  we\r\n\r\nhave  done a wonderful job because we have been able to house\r\n\r\na  very large percentage of the population.  But there  is  a\r\n\r\nsegment  which does not have access or full access to  public\r\n\r\nhousing and that is of course those who are single.  A person\r\n\r\nwho  is  under  35 years will not be able to purchase  a  HDB\r\n\r\nflat;  35  years  and  above, as I understand  it,  they  can\r\n\r\npurchase  a resale flat.  With respect to rental,  there  are\r\n\r\njoint  rental schemes but you have to be 35 years  and  above\r\n\r\nand you have to find somebody else.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, especially among the younger ones, the\r\n\r\nexpectations and the needs are changing.  There is a greater\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndesire  for  personal space.  They are not any  less  filial.\r\n\r\nThey  just need or want to have some personal space and  this\r\n\r\nis simply a function of the fact that the society in which we\r\n\r\nlive  is changing.  So you cannot say to a young person, \"You\r\n\r\ncannot have a HDB flat and, by the way, we want you to be  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneur, but please live with your mommy and daddy until\r\n\r\nyou  are  35  years  old.\"  It would not work.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nseriously  consider and think about how the mindsets  of  the\r\n\r\nyounger  ones  are  changing.  I do  understand  that  public\r\n\r\nhousing  is funded by public funds and therefore,  it  should\r\n\r\nalso  meet the public policy.  But, as the President said  in\r\n\r\nhis Address, no policy is so cast in stone that it cannot  be\r\n\r\nchanged  and  this  is one policy which is worth  looking  at\r\n\r\nbecause the numbers of singles are not going to go down.  The\r\n\r\npressures  of  the  society are such that there  is  a  great\r\n\r\npossibility  that they will increase and they should  not  be\r\n\r\ndenied  access  to  public housing simply  because  of  their\r\n\r\nmarital status.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then come to the changing environment on\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.  We have made a call for entrepreneurs  but\r\n\r\nyou cannot have entrepreneurs overnight.  Entrepreneurs are a\r\n\r\ncombination  of two things.  One, there are some  people,  by\r\n\r\ntheir  very nature and character, entrepreneurial by instinct\r\n\r\nbut there are also others who will become entrepreneurial  if\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances are right.  If we want people to  be  more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial in Singapore, there has to be a lighter touch\r\n\r\non  regulation, the environment must be such that it  enables\r\n\r\nthem  to  feel free to be entrepreneurial and they  must  not\r\n\r\nfeel  stifled.  There are various ways in which this  can  be\r\n\r\nachieved.  But the simple point that I am making is that  you\r\n\r\ncannot  just  snap  your fingers and say that  we  need  more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  and  have them appear overnight.   They  would\r\n\r\nnot.   They  are a result of both nature as well as  nurture.\r\n\r\nWith this, I conclude my address to this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have\r\n\r\novercome many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajor  political  and economic crises  in  the  past.   These\r\n\r\ncrises  have  taught us many lessons.  A key lesson  must  be\r\n\r\nthat situations are never static.  Our achievements today  do\r\n\r\nnot  guarantee our successes in future.  We must stand  ready\r\n\r\nat  all  times, not just to react to unexpected changes,  but\r\n\r\nalso  to position ourselves for the future.  In this context,\r\n\r\nI fully support the initiatives to remake Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, \"restructuring\" and \"remaking\" have been\r\n\r\nvery much in the news lately.  The letter \"R\" seems to have a\r\n\r\nlot of exposure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we understand that it is important that we have to\r\n\r\nfind  new  energies  and  directions  to  bring  us  forward.\r\n\r\nHowever, as we seek to rejuvenate ourselves, perhaps  we  can\r\n\r\nseek some inspiration from how companies renew and reposition\r\n\r\nthemselves to changing consumer trends and market situations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was recently at the Equinox Restaurant, a new\r\n\r\nrestaurant  at  Raffles City, for lunch last month.   Equinox\r\n\r\noccupies the top level of Raffles City Complex, at what  used\r\n\r\nto  be  Compass  Rose.   It  is, however,  almost  completely\r\n\r\ndifferent  from what we know about Compass Rose.   There  are\r\n\r\nnow  five  restaurants  and bars.  It  is  a  completely  new\r\n\r\nenvironment  with  different dining experiences.   It  is  an\r\n\r\nexample of renewal and rejuvenation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic, political and social challenges ahead of\r\n\r\nus  require  us  to respond with new strategies  and  renewed\r\n\r\nenergies.    Remaking  ourselves  will  give   us   the   new\r\n\r\nstrategies,  while rejuvenation will give us the strength  to\r\n\r\ncarry the strategies through.  Both are equally important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, however in the example that I have just\r\n\r\nmentioned  of  the  new  restaurant  in  Raffles  City,   not\r\n\r\neverything was renewed and rejuvenated.  One key strength  of\r\n\r\nthe  new restaurant remains from Compass Rose - the excellent\r\n\r\nview  from the top of Raffles City.  In fact, I have observed\r\n\r\nthat  the  restaurant's renovation had further  enhanced  the\r\n\r\nview to attract\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncustomers  to  come  back.  It is  an  example  where  a  key\r\n\r\nstrength   was   \"recycled\",  not   necessarily   \"remaking\".\r\n\r\nRecycling  is based on the principle of finding new  uses  of\r\n\r\nthings that are useful.  The same principle can be applied in\r\n\r\nhow we tackle our future challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some of the strengths that we can recycle as we\r\n\r\nremake ourselves?  As a labour MP, I immediately think of the\r\n\r\ntripartite  partnership between workers,  employers  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   The partnership is based on trust and  respect.\r\n\r\nIt has helped us tackle all the past crises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Minister for Manpower has given the\r\n\r\nassurance in his Addendum to the President's Address that the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will  continue  to  strengthen  the   tripartite\r\n\r\npartnership.   This partnership must be preserved  and  built\r\n\r\nupon.   It  is a pillar that binds us workers, employers  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government to the future of Singapore.  That pillar will\r\n\r\nprovide  strength  as  we collectively  face  the  challenges\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the President talked about how the world has\r\n\r\nchanged and how severe the challenges ahead.  Indeed, we live\r\n\r\nin  uncertain  times.   I would even  say  that  we  live  in\r\n\r\nunsettling times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unemployment remains high. Our workers face wage\r\n\r\nrestraints,  wage  cuts  and  retrenchment  as  the   economy\r\n\r\nrestructures.   The jobs that they lose today will  not  come\r\n\r\nback tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our regional environment is worrying too. The terrorist\r\n\r\nthreats  have  not been completely eliminated.  There  remain\r\n\r\nissues  in  our  relations with our neighbour Malaysia.   One\r\n\r\nunion  leader tells me that he is worried when he travels  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  He said he was in a taxi in Malaysia and the  taxi\r\n\r\ndriver  was so angry with Singapore.  He could not understand\r\n\r\nwhy  Malaysians  are so angry with Singapore  over  what  are\r\n\r\nessentially our domestic affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even the talks about restructuring of the economy\r\n\r\nand remaking of Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  so worrying from the point of view of the workers.   The\r\n\r\nCPF  will  also  be  reviewed.   MOM  will  be  refining  the\r\n\r\ncomponents  of  the employment benefit system, including  the\r\n\r\npayment  of  retrenchment benefits.  How will  these  changes\r\n\r\naffect workers?  The tax system is undergoing review as well.\r\n\r\nHow   will  this  affect  workers  and  how  will  it  impact\r\n\r\nSingaporeans?  There is indeed uncertainty and when there  is\r\n\r\nuncertainty, worry is unavoidable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in such an environment of uncertainty,\r\n\r\nit  is  important that we bring in another \"R\", that is,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment must constantly and clearly reassure Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nSuch  reassurance will cushion the impact of uncertainty  and\r\n\r\nprepare  Singaporeans  for  the policy  changes  ahead.   For\r\n\r\nworkers,  the  reassurance  can  take  many  forms,  such  as\r\n\r\naffirming the commitment to help them move into new job areas\r\n\r\nin  the  new  growth industries through training  and  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  and  such as those schemes to  ensure  that  their\r\n\r\nhealthcare needs will be looked after.  As a labour movement,\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC  has repeatedly reassured workers that  the  unions\r\n\r\nwill   protect   their   interests  even   as   the   economy\r\n\r\nrestructures.   We  will do our part.  We will  call  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and employers to do theirs too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans, it is important to reassure them that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has their best interest at heart.  For  major\r\n\r\npolicy  changes,  the  reassurance must be  through  concrete\r\n\r\nactions taken to minimise the policy impact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the most important \"R\" that we have talked\r\n\r\nabout today is reassurance.  If workers and Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nnot  reassured, it will be difficult for them  to  understand\r\n\r\nthe  policy changes, much less accept them.  I thus urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  not  to  neglect  the  importance  of  reassuring\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  from the initial stages of discussions,  right\r\n\r\nthrough the end of the policy formulation and implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at a critical juncture of our development. The\r\n\r\nsteps  that we take today will shape our future.  We  can  do\r\n\r\nmore  to  build and improve the infrastructure  to  fuel  our\r\n\r\ngrowth ahead.  Let me cite three examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, our public transport system. The public\r\n\r\ntransport  system  links  our homes to  our  workplaces,  our\r\n\r\nrelatives  and  families, and the recreational facilities  as\r\n\r\nwell.  It gives us greater mobility in our lives.  We already\r\n\r\nhave  a  sound public transport system.  However, we  can  do\r\n\r\neven more to improve it.  For example, we know of workers who\r\n\r\nare  reluctant to take up jobs in far away places because  of\r\n\r\nthe  transportation time and cost.  So I urge the  Government\r\n\r\nto  bring  forward  its plan to improve our public  transport\r\n\r\nsystem  by  extending the MRT and LRT network  to  cover  all\r\n\r\nhousing estates as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our telecommunications system. We now have\r\n\r\nfeatures  of a world-class telecommunications system,  as  we\r\n\r\nhave one of the highest mobile phone penetration rates in the\r\n\r\nworld.  However, I think another area we should also be  able\r\n\r\nto  do it fast is to quickly link up all homes with broadband\r\n\r\nas  well.   While I am sure that there must be sound  reasons\r\n\r\nbehind  the  current policy, I hope that the authorities  can\r\n\r\ncontinue to study and review other options.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, our living environment. We have almost universal\r\n\r\nhome  ownership  today.  We have embarked  on  programmes  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  our living environment for our residents.   We  must\r\n\r\nnot  stop  there.  As our population grows and ages,  demands\r\n\r\nwill  change,  and  we must stay ahead and  anticipate  these\r\n\r\nchanges.  We have to lay the bricks and foundations today  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  can build a much better living environment for  our\r\n\r\npeople in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the seeds we plant today will bear fruit\r\n\r\nin  future.  While we remake and rejuvenate ourselves to meet\r\n\r\nfuture  challenges, we cannot completely discard the  sources\r\n\r\nof  strength that have brought us successes thus far.  We can\r\n\r\nrecycle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  reuse  some  of  them  and, most  importantly,  we  must\r\n\r\ncontinue to clearly reassure Singaporeans that we will always\r\n\r\nhave  their  best interests in mind.  This will prepare  them\r\n\r\nfor the challenges ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek your\r\n\r\nconsent  and  the general assent of hon.
