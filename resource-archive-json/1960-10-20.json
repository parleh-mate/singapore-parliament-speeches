For an enrolment\r\n\r\nof  19,000 Malay children in Malay schools, we have\r\n\r\nonly  303  trained  teachers, the  balance  of  297\r\n\r\nteachers being only trainee teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the teaching of Malay in English and Chinese\r\n\r\nmedium schools, the position was pathetic when this\r\n\r\nGovernment took office. Statistics show that  there\r\n\r\nwere  only 34 Malay teachers. As the present  total\r\n\r\nschool  population, excluding those  in  the  Malay\r\n\r\nschools,  is about 320,000, it is not practical  to\r\n\r\ntalk  of  making the National Language a compulsory\r\n\r\nsubject  in  our font-Malay schools at the  present\r\n\r\ntime.  But  the new Government wasted  no  time  in\r\n\r\ngetting on with the task of providing the teachers.\r\n\r\nLanguage  classes  were started  in  the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining   College,   and  the   Ministry   devised\r\n\r\nexaminations to ensure that accepted standards were\r\n\r\nestablished.  To date, two examinations  have  been\r\n\r\nheld,  and a total of 2,718 teachers, of whom 2,304\r\n\r\nare  from the English medium, 409 from the  Chinese\r\n\r\nmedium,  and 5 from the Tamil medium, have sat  for\r\n\r\nthe  Std.

In  the   next\r\n\r\nexamination in March 1961, it is expected that  306\r\n\r\nteachers,  of  whom 201 will be  from  the  English\r\n\r\nmedium, 101 from the Chinese medium and 4 from  the\r\n\r\nTamil  medium, will sit for the Std.

II\r\n\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional advice which I have received on\r\n\r\nthe  teaching  of the Malay language  is  that  for\r\n\r\nteaching in primary schools, a teacher should  have\r\n\r\nobtained   at   least  a  Pass  in  the   Std.   II\r\n\r\nexamination, and to teach in secondary  schools  it\r\n\r\nis  desirable that teachers should have passed  the\r\n\r\nStd.  III  examination. I am also advised  that  to\r\n\r\nprovide  adequate  instruction for  all  pupils  in\r\n\r\nschools, it would be necessary to have on the staff\r\n\r\nof  each school at least one teacher in every three\r\n\r\nwho  is proficient in Malay. This, in terms of  our\r\n\r\npresent  staffing  figure,  means  at  least  4,000\r\n\r\nteachers  proficient in Malay, but  if  account  is\r\n\r\ntaken,   as   it   must  be  taken,   of   staffing\r\n\r\nrequirements in other respects, then the figure  of\r\n\r\nteachers of Malay is likely to be nearer the  6,000\r\n\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when there are enough teachers and facilities\r\n\r\nto  teach the National Language in all schools will\r\n\r\nthe teaching be made compulsory in all schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MALAY STUDENTS IN ENGLISH SCHOOLS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Government financial assistance)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

This\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  which  controls  dealings  in   rubber,\r\n\r\nrequires licences for the purchase of rubber, or to\r\n\r\ntreat or store rubber, prescribe duties on licences\r\n\r\nand  impose  penalties for breach of the provisions\r\n\r\nof the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malayan Rubber Export Registration Board is a\r\n\r\npan-Malayan statutory body set up under and for the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  administering the Rubber Shipping  and\r\n\r\nPacking   Control  Ordinances  of  the   State   of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation of Malaya. One of  the\r\n\r\nduties  of  the Board is to ensure that the  rubber\r\n\r\npacked and exported from Malaya is of the grade and\r\n\r\nquality  contracted  for, and generally  to  ensure\r\n\r\nhonest shipment. Accordingly it examines and  deals\r\n\r\nwith  quality  and other complaints  received  from\r\n\r\noverseas  buyers  of  rubber from  Malaya.  In  the\r\n\r\ncourse of its duties, the Board receives samples of\r\n\r\nrubber complained about which, after the complaints\r\n\r\nhave  been  dealt  with,  are  either  retained  or\r\n\r\ndisposed  of  locally  by the  Board.  It  is  more\r\n\r\ndesirable  that  the Board, as a disciplinary  body\r\n\r\nwith quasi judicial powers, should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaintain  a  position of dignity and  prestige  and\r\n\r\ncommand   the   respect  of   the   rubber   trade.\r\n\r\nAccordingly it is appropriate that it should not be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  be  licensed as  an  ordinary  rubber\r\n\r\ndealer.  In order to perform its functions  without\r\n\r\ncontravening the Ordinance, the Board  seeks  total\r\n\r\nexemption under the provisions of section 19 of the\r\n\r\nRubber Dealers Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 19 provides that such exemption may be\r\n\r\ngranted  by  the Minister but shall not  come  into\r\n\r\nforce until it has been approved by the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to section 19 of the\r\n\r\nRubber  Dealers  Ordinance (Chapter 199),  resolves\r\n\r\nthat the grant by the Prime Minister to the Malayan\r\n\r\nRubber Export Registration Board of total exemption\r\n\r\nfrom all the provisions of the said Ordinance or of\r\n\r\nany rules made thereunder, with effect from the 1st\r\n\r\nday  of September, 1960, as con-tamed in Paper S.L.\r\n\r\n28 of 1960, be approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MALAYANISATION - EXPATRIATE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg to move the motion standing in my name,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly urges the Government to take\r\n\r\nimmediate   steps  to  Malayanise  all   expatriate\r\n\r\nadministrative officials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is one of Hong Lim's 16 resolutions. I\r\n\r\nam  grateful,  Sir,  that I  am  being  given  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to debate this issue in this  Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt  is indeed absurd to find it necessary for me to\r\n\r\nintroduce   this  motion  five  years   after   the\r\n\r\npublication  of  the  report of the  Malayanisation\r\n\r\nCommission, one of whose members on the  Government\r\n\r\nbenches  is  the Minister for Culture.

Let\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nme  just refer to page 25 of the Interim Report  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malayanisation  Commission,  which  quoted  an\r\n\r\nextract  from \"The Civil Service Today\"  by  T.  A.\r\n\r\nCritchley. It is about the administrative class  in\r\n\r\na modern state. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the modern administrative civil servants are the\r\n\r\npermanent links between the Cabinet and the bulk of\r\n\r\nthe   Civil  Service.  They  are  the  \"intelligent\r\n\r\namateurs\" to whom the day-to-day government of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  is  entrusted.  They  are  concerned  with\r\n\r\npolicy,  with  directing  the  business  of   whole\r\n\r\nDepartments, with  preparing new  legislation  and\r\n\r\ndrafting  regulations and circulars, with assisting\r\n\r\nand  advising  Ministers in the  conduct  of  their\r\n\r\nParliamentary   business,  and   above   all   with\r\n\r\nconstructive  long-term  thinking   and   the   co-ordination of the activities of government.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this shows the importance of the administrative class. The expatriate administrative\r\n\r\nofficials very often occupy top positions  in  this\r\n\r\nadministrative class - that is, in the administrative\r\n\r\nclass  hierarchy.  There  is  no  need  to  further\r\n\r\nemphasise   the   vital   importance   of   British\r\n\r\nadministrative officials in the power of the State.\r\n\r\nIt  is  sufficient to say that they are the  people\r\n\r\nwho  keep  the  Union Jack flying in the  colonies.\r\n\r\nThey run the British Empire. Our Prime Minister  is\r\n\r\naware  of  this  position. In  1956,  he  said,  in\r\n\r\nHansard Volume 2, No. 15, dated 5th December, 1956,\r\n\r\ncolumn 1088:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is little time left for us to take over the\r\n\r\nwhole  apparatus of state and to make  it  function\r\n\r\nmore  efficiently  than it did under  the  colonial\r\n\r\nsystem.   In   this   apparatus   of   state    the\r\n\r\nadministrators are a decisive factor.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate on 5th December, 1956, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  said - please  refer  to  column  1080   of\r\n\r\nHansard:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...the major recommendations of this White Paper'-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Prime  Minister was referring in 1956  to  the White  Paper  on  the Malayanisation  statement  of\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the Lim Yew Hock Government  (Sessional\r\n\r\nPaper No. Cmd. 65 of 1956):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...the major recommendations of this White Paper\r\n\r\nwere  acceptable to most Members of the Opposition,\r\n\r\nnamely  the  acceptance of the principle  that  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  room  of the civil service will  be  taken\r\n\r\naway  from  the white man and put into local  hands\r\n\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...We are not supporting this statement of policy\r\n\r\nbecause  we  believe that if this  White  Paper  is\r\n\r\nimplemented   Malayanisation   will    become    an\r\n\r\naccomplished fact. We support it because  once  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  handing over  the  control  room  is\r\n\r\naccepted and implemented, then the flood gates  are\r\n\r\nopened, and the white men will be swept out of  all\r\n\r\npositions of administrative control in the next few\r\n\r\nyears.  That  is why we have accepted in  principle\r\n\r\nthe  statement  of policy laid down in  this  White\r\n\r\nPaper.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, we never make quotations out  of\r\n\r\ncontext  and  try  to  destroy the  meaning.  These\r\n\r\nspeeches of the Prime Minister were made four years\r\n\r\nago.  Yes,  Mr Speaker, Sir, this is  the  correct\r\n\r\nbasic  stand on this issue of Malayanisation to  be\r\n\r\ntaken  by  every  true and loyal  patriot  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956, the Malayanisation Commission - please\r\n\r\nrefer  to  page  29  of  its interim  report - stated\r\n\r\ncategorically   that   the,  whole   administrative\r\n\r\nservice   of  the  Singapore  Government   can   be\r\n\r\nMalayanised   in   two   years.   In   1956,    the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  Commission  stated  that   we   can\r\n\r\nreplace  British administrators with local officers\r\n\r\nwithin  two  years,  that is by  1958.  Why  is  it\r\n\r\nnecessary for us today to bring up this motion? Why\r\n\r\nis  it we still have in Singapore, five years after\r\n\r\nthe  sitting of this Commission and more  than  one\r\n\r\nyear  of  the  P.A.P. forming the  Government, the\r\n\r\npresence   of  expatriate  administrative  officers\r\n\r\nholding  key positions in the State - as a matter  of\r\n\r\nfact,  holding more important positions  than  they\r\n\r\ndid under the Lint Yew Hock Government? Despite the\r\n\r\nfact   that   the   Lim   Yew   Hock   Government's\r\n\r\nMalayanisation policy had varied in  some  respects\r\n\r\nfrom the recommendations of the Commission, it  was\r\n\r\nstill generally acceptable and its broad principles\r\n\r\nwere  accepted  by the P.A.P. and endorsed  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar in the  debate  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly   in  1956.  It  is  a  shame  that   this\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  issue, which has been  endorsed  by\r\n\r\nall  parties concerned, should today be the subject\r\n\r\nof  a  debate.  Mr Speaker, Sir, it  is  a  debate\r\n\r\nurging  the so-called P.A.P. Government to expedite\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  and  also to repatriate  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficials who are already Malayanised - I repeat \"who\r\n\r\nare already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalayanised\" - but whose terms were extended both by\r\n\r\nthe previous Government and by the present\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, since the new Government was formed, it has never made any clear stand on this issue of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation,  The  Lim  Yew  Hock   Government's\r\n\r\nMalayanisation   policy  of  1956  still   requires\r\n\r\nimplementation   and  accomplishment.   Could   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  clarify its intentions and  give  us  a\r\n\r\nprogress  report  of  the Malayanisation  situation\r\n\r\ndepartment by department?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, events during the past one\r\n\r\nyear  have raised doubts in my mind about the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's stand on this important issue. I  simply\r\n\r\ncannot  understand  why  we  can  allow  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficials  to  exercise  so  much  control  in  the\r\n\r\nState - in  fact,  to exercise tighter  control  than\r\n\r\nthey  did  during  the days of  the  Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment. For instance, Mr Speaker, Sir, what is\r\n\r\nthe    purpose   of   retaining   George   Thomson?\r\n\r\n[Interruption].  You  cannot  smile  it  off.   The\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  Commission had already  recommended\r\n\r\nin  page 37 of its interim report that the post  of\r\n\r\nPublic Relations Officer (which George Thomson had\r\n\r\noccupied  in  1955)  can be  replaced  by  a  local\r\n\r\njournalist.   The  Prime  Minister  supported   the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission Report. The Lim Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment's Malayanisation policy laid down,  that\r\n\r\nthe  post  of  Public Relations  Officer  could  be\r\n\r\nretained  for  a  year  and,  according   to   this\r\n\r\nstatement,   George  Thomson   should   have   been\r\n\r\nrepatriated in October 1957. However, the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  extended  his  stay  till  the  general\r\n\r\nelections  in  May  1959.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   we\r\n\r\nunderstand  and forgive the Labour Front Government\r\n\r\nfor  extending Thomson's stay and contract  despite\r\n\r\nits  declared policy, because we, all know that had\r\n\r\nThomson  been dispensed with, many of the Ministers\r\n\r\nin  the  previous Government would have been unable\r\n\r\nto  make  coherent political speeches. But what  we\r\n\r\ncannot  understand is why should George Thomson  be\r\n\r\nretained under a P.A.P. Government? Does he provide\r\n\r\nthe same services?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> After quoting extensively\r\n\r\nfrom me, you -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I will come back to that, Mr\r\n\r\nPrime Minister. He wrote your speech at the opening\r\n\r\nof the Art Exhibition for India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister supported both the White Paper and the Malayanisation Report on this matter. It\r\n\r\nhas  also been pledged in the general elections  to\r\n\r\nthe  people that George Thomson must go under'  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. regime.  But  is that  the  case?  No,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  George Thomson is still  here,  going  as\r\n\r\nstrong as Johnny Walker! In fact, he is occupying a\r\n\r\nfar more important position than he ever did in the\r\n\r\nprevious Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are not interested in, attacking personalities. Since the P.A.P. crisis, we have\r\n\r\nconfined   our  debates  on  principles   and,   on\r\n\r\npolitical  issues.  We wish to make  it  manifestly\r\n\r\nclear  that  in  today's debate on  the  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficials we are not making any comment on them  as\r\n\r\nprivate  individuals  but only  in  so  far  as  it\r\n\r\ninvolves  their  official duties. These  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers may be honest and capable officers.  If  I\r\n\r\nmay  say  this, all these fights boil down  to  the\r\n\r\nstruggle  for political power between  the  British\r\n\r\ncolonialists on the one hand and the people on  the\r\n\r\nother  as  to  who  shall guide our  destinies  and\r\n\r\ndecide  our  fate.  Once upon  a  time,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  liked to attack harshly and  ridicu1e  on\r\n\r\nthis  side  of  the  House the private  persons  of\r\n\r\nexpatriates like Goode, Sutherland and  others.  He\r\n\r\nonce remarked that he would kick the white men  out\r\n\r\ninto  the  sea.  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  we, are, not\r\n\r\ninterested in driving any people into the sea,  for\r\n\r\nthat  matter  the  British included,  We  are  only\r\n\r\ninterested in putting an end to this evil system of\r\n\r\ncolonialism. And for that matter, all  the  peoples\r\n\r\nin  the world, particularly in Asia and Africa, are\r\n\r\nnow   up   in   arms   against  this   system   of\r\n\r\ncolonialism - an   evil  system  of   political   and\r\n\r\neconomic  exploitation by Imperialist countries  of\r\n\r\nsubject  peoples,  of human indignities  and  moral\r\n\r\ndisgrace.  Was it not so long ago that  the  United\r\n\r\nNations  adopted  a  unanimous  decision   to   end\r\n\r\ncolonialism as a clear declaration of the wishes of\r\n\r\nall the peoples? We are fighting a system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  not  its individuals. British individuals  can\r\n\r\nremain here as friends but not as masters. Why  did\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister several years ago  attack  the\r\n\r\nBritish in a personal way about their comforts  and\r\n\r\ntheir  clubs here? Was it because he admired  their\r\n\r\nprivileges? However, once he himself enjoyed  those\r\n\r\nsame  privileges when he became Prime  Minister  he\r\n\r\nceased  to  fight  and those whom he  had  attacked\r\n\r\nsuddenly  became  his close friends - as  the  saying\r\n\r\ngoes: \"A friend, guide and philosopher.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, so today, Mr Thomson became a friend, guide and philosopher of our Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.

However, the brainwashing of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants in the name of political studies was  only\r\n\r\npart  of the duties of George Thomson.

His\r\n\r\npresence  was  felt  everywhere  in  Singapore.  He\r\n\r\ndelivered  lectures  at  meetings,  symposiums  and\r\n\r\nforums.

After  a\r\n\r\nbreak  for tea the real stuff, in the form of small\r\n\r\ndiscussion groups, began, like the tutorial  system\r\n\r\nin  the  universities under the guidance of  George\r\n\r\nThomson  and  Gerald de Cruz.  This  is  the  media\r\n\r\nthrough  which  indoctrination  is  hoped   to   be\r\n\r\neffectively  carried out. In this  tutorial  system\r\n\r\nseveral  people,  who once hated the  P.A.P.,  talk\r\n\r\nabout  Communism and other subjects  to  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants,   occasionally  casting   aspersions   on\r\n\r\nindividual Ministers they do not like.

The second phase culminated\r\n\r\nin  the  dismissal of Tan Gak Eng from the People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party. The third phase ended in the special\r\n\r\nParty  Conference of June 1960.

The\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim is a responsible Member of this\r\n\r\nAssembly  and he must first have grounds before  he\r\n\r\nmakes an allegation of that nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can find no\r\n\r\nother reason for the arrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The second  of\r\n\r\nthe  Big Three is Mr P. H. Meadows. During the Lim\r\n\r\nYew  Hock Government, .Meadows was Deputy Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the  Ministry of  Local  Government,\r\n\r\nLands and Housing, Chairman of the Rural Board  and\r\n\r\nChairman  of the Planning Committee of  the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nWhen   I   was  appointed  Minister  for   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  which combined the former  portfolios\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister for Local Government,  Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing,  and  various  other departments,  Meadows\r\n\r\nautomatically became a member of the staff  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development. As I became  more\r\n\r\nand  more  familiar with the work of the  Ministry.\r\n\r\nthe  presence  and activities of Meadows  began  to\r\n\r\ngive  me cause for alarm. From whatever files  that\r\n\r\nwere   not  missing  from  the  Ministry  of  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  and from reports, I began to  form  the\r\n\r\nopinion -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a very\r\n\r\nserious  statement has been made  that  files  were\r\n\r\nmissing from the Ministry, and this is mentioned in\r\n\r\nreference  to this particular officer,  Mr  P.

I  think  it is very  important  that  we\r\n\r\nshould   be   informed   if  files   are   missing,\r\n\r\nparticularly as the Minister knew about it,  as  he\r\n\r\nthen  was the Minister.

After the  victory\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. and the Government was in the process\r\n\r\nof being formed, the Prime Minister-designate asked\r\n\r\nme  to  appoint one Mr Meadows, who was the Deputy\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretary  to  the  Ministry  of   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Lands  and  Housing,  as   the   Chief\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Officer of the City  Council.  This\r\n\r\nwas the first time I heard about him but I told the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  that  on  no  account  should   an\r\n\r\nexpatriate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhead  the  City  Council again, as  this  would  be\r\n\r\ntantamount  to  going back to the pre-Rendel  days.\r\n\r\nLater,  I appointed Mr P. C. Lim, the most senior\r\n\r\nlocal   officer,  to  be  the  Administrator;   but\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  when the Prime Minister  took  over\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council  in October  1959,  his  earlier\r\n\r\nintention  of making Meadows the real boss  of  the\r\n\r\nCity Council materialised. Again, on the day before\r\n\r\nthe swearing in ceremony of the new Government, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister told me to sign an order  declaring\r\n\r\nthe  post  of  C.A.O. redundant. He said  that  the\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretary would wait for me outside  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  Chamber;  but  when  I  left  the  Council\r\n\r\nChamber  I was surprised to see instead Mr Meadows\r\n\r\nwho adjourned to the Committee Room. I read through\r\n\r\nthe  order and found it unnecessary. The suspension\r\n\r\nof  any civil servant does not require a Government\r\n\r\norder. Suffice it to say that the effect of signing\r\n\r\nthat  order  would  have been  detrimental  to  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you will see that I am trying to avoid mentioning as many names as possible. What I\r\n\r\ndo  not understand was the great haste taken to get\r\n\r\nme  to sign this order. After a discussion, Meadows\r\n\r\nagreed  with me that the suspension of the post  of\r\n\r\nany civil servant did not require an order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Singapore Improvement Trust, which was\r\n\r\nsynonymous with corruption and inefficiency  during\r\n\r\nthe Lim Yew Hock Government, was to be reorganised.\r\n\r\nI  asked  Meadows, who  was the  Deputy  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary, one or two days after the Government was\r\n\r\nformed,  to  put  up  a paper appointing  the  most\r\n\r\nsenior local architect there as the Chairman of the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. to start a cleaning-up campaign. Meadows was\r\n\r\na  former  member of the S.I.T. and Chairman  of  its\r\n\r\nPlanning   Committee.  This  proposal   and   later\r\n\r\nproposals to reorganise the S.I.T. were turned down\r\n\r\nby  the  Prime Minister, and from the tone  of  the\r\n\r\ndiscussions  it was manifestly clear  that  he  had\r\n\r\ncontacted,  directly  or  indirectly,  Mr  Meadows\r\n\r\nbefore the meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> \"Directly or indirectly,\r\n\r\ncontacted Mr Meadows\" at the time when Mr Meadows\r\n\r\nwas  supposed  to be working for the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development, is that the suggestion?

Please refer to Hansard, Volume 1,\r\n\r\nNo. 2, dated 26th April, 1955, col. 58. The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in 1955 said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...unless the Government can pursue this policy of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  not only in the  Government  Public\r\n\r\nServices, but in all the Public Services and,  last\r\n\r\nbut  not  least,  in the Singapore  Harbour  Board,\r\n\r\nwhere a very important Public Service is run almost\r\n\r\nexclusively by expatriate officers, there is  going\r\n\r\nto  be  a  great  deal  of. I  would  not  call  it\r\n\r\nsabotage,   but   I   would   just   say,   general\r\n\r\ndislocation,   when  a  really   vigorous   Malayan\r\n\r\nNationalist Government takes over in the very  near\r\n\r\nfuture...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr   Speaker,   Sir,  the  Prime  Minister   aptly\r\n\r\nsummarised  the  whole position in  1955.  Meadows,\r\n\r\nwith his colonial octopus, was building an army  of\r\n\r\nresistance around his air-conditioned room where he\r\n\r\ncould  plan  and  contact all  his  key  people  in\r\n\r\nprivate. With the presence of Meadows, there was no\r\n\r\ndoubt  in my mind that the reorganisation  work  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  would be difficult to push  through.\r\n\r\nAny  governmental  measures aimed  at  cutting  the\r\n\r\nexisting   privileges   would   be   difficult   to\r\n\r\nimplement.  Difficulties were imposed on  my  plan,\r\n\r\nfor   instance,  to  impose  assessments  on  Shell\r\n\r\nproperties  in Pulau Bukom (they pay no  assessment\r\n\r\nand do not need to follow building and planning by-laws;  Pulau Bukom is run by Shell Company, exactly\r\n\r\nlike a foreign concession), my plan to impose taxes\r\n\r\non  military vehicles which cause great  damage  to\r\n\r\nour  roads (military vehicles pay no tax  at  all),\r\n\r\nand  my  plan  to  revise assessments  on  military\r\n\r\nproperties   (they  pay  little   or   hardly   any\r\n\r\nassessments  at  present).

I shall quote  below  the\r\n\r\nrelevant   parts  of  the  1955   Report   of   the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission on the Police Force. Page\r\n\r\n55 of the Interim Report says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The posts of Commissioner of Police, Deputy\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Police and the remaining  post  of\r\n\r\nSenior  Assistant Commissioner of  Police  can  be\r\n\r\nMalayanised in three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner of Police should be asked to\r\n\r\nremain as Adviser to the Police Force for 1 more\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Police Force can be completely\r\n\r\nMalayanised in three years without loss of\r\n\r\nefficiency.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, that was in 1955. And this is what the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  had  said in  the  debate  on  5th\r\n\r\nDecember,  1956, on the statement of Malayanisation\r\n\r\npolicy by the Lim Yew Hock Government. Please refer\r\n\r\nto  Hansard,  Vol.  2, No. 15 dated  5th  December,\r\n\r\n1956, cols. 1081 to 1082. Mr Speaker, Sir, on  5th\r\n\r\nDecember, 1956, the Prime Minister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Commissioner of Police himself admitted\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Malayanisation  Commission  that   the\r\n\r\npolice  force  including  his  own  job  could   be\r\n\r\nMalayanised   in   five   years.   The   Commission\r\n\r\nrecommended  a period of three. The Government  has\r\n\r\nchosen six. To a certain extent, the experience  of\r\n\r\nMembers  on the other side of the recent  disorders\r\n\r\nin  the  Colony of Singapore when they  found  that\r\n\r\ntheir own lives and property had to be defended  by\r\n\r\nGurkha troops and police and European officers  may\r\n\r\nhave  weighed  heavily in their  minds,  The  Asian\r\n\r\nofficers  in the police force no doubt are somewhat\r\n\r\nfrustrated  and embittered about the Malayanisation\r\n\r\nof the police force.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And then in col. 1082, in paragraph 2, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister continued:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, I say this to the Asian officers, if they\r\n\r\ndemand the right to take over the police force, let\r\n\r\nus see their mettle. Let us see the grit that is\r\n\r\nwanted in men who are to hold the rifle barrel in\r\n\r\nthis little island. Unless they can prove to us\r\n\r\nthat they have guts, courage and integrity, then\r\n\r\nthey deserve what they have got in this White\r\n\r\nPaper.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, this was the debate on the Lim\r\n\r\nYew Hock Government's White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the police force is at present far from being Malayanised. Although the number of\r\n\r\nexpatriate  police  officers has been  considerably\r\n\r\nreduced since the publication of the Malayanisation\r\n\r\nCommission  Report  in  1955,  yet  the   effective\r\n\r\ncontrol of tie police by the British is by no means\r\n\r\nless.    This   is   achieved   by   a   systematic\r\n\r\ncentralisation  of  power  in  the  hands  of   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner. What has the Prime Minister  done  to\r\n\r\ngive  local  officers a chance to prove themselves?\r\n\r\nSuffice  it to say that were it not for the  intra-Party struggle waged between the pro-colonial line\r\n\r\nand  the anti-colonial line in the P.A.P. since the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  formed,  the  important  posts  of\r\n\r\nDeputy  Commissioner and the Chief  of  the  C.I.D.\r\n\r\nwould  still  be  in  the hands of  the  expatriate\r\n\r\npolice  officers  today. The Prime  Minister  seems\r\n\r\nalways  to  have  a higher regard for  expatriates.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Malayanisation Commission  Report,\r\n\r\nthe  Malayanisation  of the  police  force  can  be\r\n\r\ncompleted now. It is a shame to the people of  this\r\n\r\ncountry  to have the police force controlled  by  a\r\n\r\nhandful of foreigners. Or is the Prime Minister now\r\n\r\nin  the same boat as the former Chief Minister was?\r\n\r\nThis  is what the Prime Minister once said in  1956\r\n\r\nin  the debate on the Malayanisation of the police.\r\n\r\nAs  I  quoted just now from Hansard, Vol.  2, col.\r\n\r\n1081:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To a certain extent, the experience of Members on\r\n\r\nthe  other  side  of the: recent disorders  in  the\r\n\r\nColony of Singapore when they found that their  own\r\n\r\nlives  and  property had to be defended  by  Gurkha\r\n\r\ntroops:  and police and European officers may  have\r\n\r\nweighed heavily in their minds.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, perhaps this now weighs  heavily\r\n\r\nin  the  mind of the Prime Minister. I can find  no\r\n\r\nother  reason  for  the Prime  Minister  not  being\r\n\r\ninterested  in the complete Malayanisation  of  the\r\n\r\npolice  force  than  the above reason.  Has  he  no\r\n\r\nconfidence  in our own people? That our  own  local\r\n\r\nadministrators   can  run  the  Prime   Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice.  That  our own intellectuals  can  organise\r\n\r\npolitical  discussions based on  our  own  national\r\n\r\nidentity  and  thinking. That our own local  Police\r\n\r\nofficers  can maintain law and order when entrusted\r\n\r\nwith  the  task.  Or does the Prime Minister  still\r\n\r\nprefer an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpatriate who cannot multiply figures by six to  a\r\n\r\nlocal  accountant? As an accountant,  I  say  this,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  that this local officer  is  easily\r\n\r\nconsidered  to  be one of the top local  accounting\r\n\r\nbrains in Singapore, both in Government and private\r\n\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this debate, we have\r\n\r\nconfined  ourselves to the question  of  expatriate\r\n\r\nadministrative  officials only. It  does  not  mean\r\n\r\nthat  the question of expatriate technical officers\r\n\r\nis  not important. Although they have control  over\r\n\r\nour  power  structure,  their  control  is  not  as\r\n\r\nfundamental as the expatriate administrators'.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   the  source  of  Government   power   in\r\n\r\nSingapore is not to be found in the P.A.P., nor  in\r\n\r\nthe  Central Executive Committee in the P.A.P., nor\r\n\r\nin  the P.A.P. Assemblymen, nor in the Cabinet. The\r\n\r\nCabinet  only gives the formal approval  of  power.\r\n\r\nThe  source of power is to be found in a group  of\r\n\r\nindividuals  most  of  whom  are  not  elected  and\r\n\r\nresponsible  to the people. The day-to-day  running\r\n\r\nof   the   government  of  the  country  is   being\r\n\r\nundertaken at present by these five men: first, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, second, the Minister for  Finance,\r\n\r\nthird,  Meadows, fourth. Blades, and fifth,  George\r\n\r\nThomson.  I  do not blame the latter  three.  Their\r\n\r\nduty  is  to the British Empire, and for that  they\r\n\r\nhave  shown  and given loyal service. The  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council, the Singapore  Constitution  and\r\n\r\nthe  British  Military Force have their  respective\r\n\r\ntasks to fulfill, other than the day-to-day running\r\n\r\nof  the Government. The Ministers are more like the\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretaries.  It  is  something  of  the\r\n\r\nnature of de Gaulle's Cabinet. Mr K. M. Byrne,  as\r\n\r\nthe Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry  of the Lim Yew Hock Government,  had\r\n\r\nmore  power and authority than he has as a Minister\r\n\r\nunder the present Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

In  the  present  context,  Mr  Meadows,\r\n\r\nalthough in theory only possessing the status of  a\r\n\r\nDeputy  Permanent Secretary, speaks with  far  more\r\n\r\nauthority  and  exerts  far  more  power  than  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> How stupid!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, he will wake\r\n\r\nup one day to see his pants stripped off!

You will recollect that he has said that\r\n\r\nit  is  utterly absurd for anyone to have  proposed\r\n\r\nthe  motion,  and  if only he had followed  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that this statement leads  one  to,  he\r\n\r\nwould  have  kept  his mouth  shut  and  sat  down,\r\n\r\nthereby   sparing  this  Assembly  a   most   sorry\r\n\r\nexhibition,  I  do  not think the  dignity  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly   has  been  heightened  by  the   pitiful\r\n\r\nspectacle of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmisrepresentation,  lack of logic  and  incoherence\r\n\r\nwith  which we have been regaled for the last  hour\r\n\r\nand a half. Before I deal with the substance of the\r\n\r\nmotion,   may   I  first  make  a  few  preliminary\r\n\r\nobservations  to  clear  up  some  misunderstanding\r\n\r\nwhich might arise from what the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nhas said?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did rise on a point of clarification to point\r\n\r\nout the distinction between the Malayanisation of a\r\n\r\npost  and  the  Malayanisation of an  officer.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim said that the distinction  was\r\n\r\nquite  clear  to  him. But he immediately  made  it\r\n\r\nquite  evident  that he is completely  ignorant  of\r\n\r\nthis  very  elementary  fact.  When  you  say   you\r\n\r\nMalayanise a post by such and such a year, it means\r\n\r\nthat  that  post will not be held by an  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficer, After that time, the post will be held  by\r\n\r\na local officer. But it does not mean that the then\r\n\r\nincumbent of the post would be Malayanised.  So  it\r\n\r\nwas  in the case of Mr Meadows, when he held the\r\n\r\npost  of  Deputy Secretary in 1955/1956,  and  that\r\n\r\npost  was  recommended for Malayanisation  and  was\r\n\r\nduly  Malayanised. But Mr Meadows was a member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan  Civil  Service,  and,  as  such,  was\r\n\r\navailable  for  transfer to other  posts.  And  his\r\n\r\nMalayanisation date is not due to take effect until\r\n\r\nsome  time  in  1962.  The  Member  for  Hong  Lim,\r\n\r\ntherefore, misled the Assembly. I hope, in charity,\r\n\r\nthat  he did that unconsciously. But he misled  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  in  trying to make out that  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment has extended the terms of Mr Meadows'\r\n\r\nservice  beyond his due date. The Member  for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim said that he based his whole case on principle.\r\n\r\nBut for more than an hour, we have been treated  to\r\n\r\na  personal  attack  on three expatriate  officers,\r\n\r\ntheir  lack of integrity, their perfidy  and  their\r\n\r\nunreliability. The Member for Hong Lim, as a Member\r\n\r\nof  this Assembly, occupies a position of privilege\r\n\r\nwhen  he  utters any word in this Assembly, if  he\r\n\r\nwere  to  make  the  same  statement  outside   the\r\n\r\nAssembly  in the same reckless manner that  he  has\r\n\r\ndone, I venture to suggest that he would soon  land\r\n\r\nin a libel suit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister will not give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member will have time\r\n\r\nlater  in  the debate to make use of the  occasion.\r\n\r\nTime flies and we do not want to be held up in this\r\n\r\nrather foolish motion for the rest of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Hong Lim, as everyone knows,\r\n\r\nis  a  great  lad for gimmicks.

Everytime  he  built  a\r\n\r\nstand-pipe,  an opening ceremony was duly  arranged\r\n\r\nwith pomp and splendour, whereby the generosity  of\r\n\r\nthe then Mayor could be publicly acclaimed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> It was for the Party!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He wanted to chase all cars\r\n\r\nfrom Raffles Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I trust that that  will\r\n\r\nbe -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Unless the actions described\r\n\r\nrelate  to  expatriate officers, I am  afraid  they\r\n\r\nmust  be  irrelevant. Because the actions  must  be\r\n\r\nrelated to expatriate officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this motion is but the\r\n\r\nsecond  of  the  motions to be  introduced  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong  Lim.  At the  last  sitting,  he\r\n\r\nintroduced a motion on political detainees,  and  I\r\n\r\nhave  no  doubt  that in future sittings  we  shall\r\n\r\ncontinue to be regaled at each meeting with further\r\n\r\nmotions until we reach the magic number of 16.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  vigorously  countered  his   first\r\n\r\nmotion  and today we shall slap this second  motion\r\n\r\ndown just as effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first consider what the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim proposes to achieve by introducing this motion.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, let us never imagine that the purpose\r\n\r\nof the motion is what he purports to do, namely, to\r\n\r\nadvance the cause of local officers. Civil servants\r\n\r\nin  the  City  Council,  the Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, the Housing Board and other Government\r\n\r\ndepartments, over whom the Member once held sway as\r\n\r\noverlord,  know  him too well as  a  tyrant  and  a\r\n\r\nbully.  His  departure from the  City  Council  was\r\n\r\ngreeted by a spontaneous outburst of joy and relief\r\n\r\non  the  part of local officers, many of whom  held\r\n\r\ncelebrations on the day the news was announced.  So\r\n\r\nit   was   too   with  the  Ministry  of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,   the   Housing   Board   and    other\r\n\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim is not foolish enough to\r\n\r\nimagine  that at this late stage he could  retrieve\r\n\r\nhis  reputation with the local officers.  What  he\r\n\r\nhopes to achieve by this motion is simply this.  He\r\n\r\nis  trying  to get across to the public the  motion\r\n\r\nthat  the present Government is pro-expatriate  and\r\n\r\nthat this is just one more piece of evidence of the\r\n\r\nsoft  attitude  of the Government  towards  British\r\n\r\nColonialism. In this way, he hopes to maintain  his\r\n\r\npost  as  a  true  defender of the  people  against\r\n\r\nBritish Colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that such a\r\n\r\npretence  will  not deceive even a  child, if  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong Lim had taken pains  to  get  his\r\n\r\nfacts straight, he would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  found  that, in the light of what  is  taking\r\n\r\nplace,  this motion is utterly nonsensical. Let  me\r\n\r\npresent  to  the  Assembly some figures  about  the\r\n\r\nnumbers   of   expatriate  officers  now   in   the\r\n\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion does not deal with technical officers\r\n\r\nsuch  as  engineers, doctors,  architects  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.  It  is  concerned  with  officers  who  are\r\n\r\nengaged   in   the  administrative   functions   of\r\n\r\nGovernment   departments.   We   can   grade   such\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officers  into two  groups.  The  first\r\n\r\nconsists  of  members of the former  Malayan  Civil\r\n\r\nService,  the Malayan administrative pool and  such\r\n\r\ntypes.  They  are the elite of the former  Colonial\r\n\r\nAdministrative Service. Indeed, at one time it  was\r\n\r\ncommon-place to call them the heaven-born,  because\r\n\r\nof  the  prestige they enjoyed and the  power  they\r\n\r\nwielded.   They   held  the  key   posts   in   the\r\n\r\nadministration  and it was they who decided  policy\r\n\r\nand   executed   it.   Before  the   Malayanisation\r\n\r\nCommission made its recommendations in 1956,  there\r\n\r\nwere 48 such European administrative officers,  and\r\n\r\nmost  of  them  were members of the  Malayan  Civil\r\n\r\nService.  Under the programme for phased retirement\r\n\r\nof these officers, if these officers had elected to\r\n\r\nserve  their full term of service, there  would  be\r\n\r\nserving  in  Singapore no less  than  33  of  these\r\n\r\nexpatriate  administrative officers.  What  is  the\r\n\r\nposition  today? There are no more  than  three  of\r\n\r\nthem. And may I hasten to add that these three  are\r\n\r\nnot  the famous trio who have become the b\u00eate noire\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for Hong Lim. In the face of  this,\r\n\r\nonly  a  fool would maintain that there  should  be\r\n\r\nanxiety   about  the  pace  of  Malayanisation   of\r\n\r\nadministrative officers of this grade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another group of officers who perform\r\n\r\nadministrative functions though they do\r\n\r\nnot belong to the Malayan Civil Service. By and\r\n\r\nlarge, they serve in various departmental services\r\n\r\nsuch as Customs, Income Tax, Police, Audit,\r\n\r\nBroadcasting, Education, Prisons and so forth. They\r\n\r\nadminister particular Ordinances for which their\r\n\r\ndepartments are responsible. Before the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission made its recommendations,\r\n\r\nthere were about 250\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   these   officers.  Under  the   programme   of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation,   there  would  be   remaining   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today  135 if all had  chosen  to  serve\r\n\r\ntheir  full term of service. In actual fact,  there\r\n\r\nare now only 24 of them. So we see today, out of  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of some 300 expatriate officers who were  in\r\n\r\nvarious  administrative positions in the Government\r\n\r\nservice,  only 27 now remain. All the  others  have\r\n\r\nexercised the option for retirement before the date\r\n\r\nof Malayanisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of these facts, the conclusion must\r\n\r\nbe  that Malayanisation is no longer an issue  that\r\n\r\nneed cause any anxiety as to the point of retention\r\n\r\nof  unduly large numbers of expatriate officers. As\r\n\r\nregards  the  magical powers which the famous  trio\r\n\r\nhave  been  ascribed to have, may I say that  these\r\n\r\nonly  exist  in  the  paranoid imagination  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large-scale retirement of expatriate officers has\r\n\r\nleft  great  gaps  in  the administrative  machine.\r\n\r\nThese  have been gallantly filled by local officers\r\n\r\nwhose performance is a credit both to them and  the\r\n\r\ncountry. In the brief space of three or four years,\r\n\r\nnearly   all  the  responsible  positions  in   the\r\n\r\nadministration  are  now in local  hands.  In  many\r\n\r\ninstances, comparatively young officers have had to\r\n\r\ntake  on responsibilities which they normally would\r\n\r\nbe  required  to  do  at a much  greater  stage  of\r\n\r\nseniority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of Malayanisation has been discussed\r\n\r\nin  the Assembly during the debate on the speech of\r\n\r\nthe  Yang di-Pertuan Negara. I will quote  at  some\r\n\r\nlength  from  this  debate,  but  I  think  it   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  here to point out that the  approach  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government and the approach of the Member for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  towards the issue of Malayanisation  are\r\n\r\nradically  different. We want  to  fill  the  posts\r\n\r\nvacated  by expatriate officers with the ablest  of\r\n\r\nour  local  officers.  The  Member  for  Hong  Lim,\r\n\r\nhowever,  regards  Malayanisation  as  an  exercise\r\n\r\nwhereby  his  cronies from Batu Pahat could  occupy\r\n\r\nhigh   official  positions  for  which   they   are\r\n\r\ncompletely  unfitted. This point has  been  clearly\r\n\r\nbrought out by the Prime Minister in his final\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naddress in the debate on the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara,  and the case  of  another  famous\r\n\r\ntrio,  the Lu: brothers and young Mr Owen, is  now\r\n\r\npublic knowledge. Nevertheless, I cannot resist the\r\n\r\ntemptation  to quote some extracts from  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Address. First, there was Mr  Lui  Boon\r\n\r\nPoh  who was appointed by the Member for Hong  Lim,\r\n\r\nwhen  he was the Minister for National Development,\r\n\r\nto  take  charge of the three great departments  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's   public  utilities - the   Electricity,\r\n\r\nWater  and  Gas  Departments.  At  column  578   of\r\n\r\nHansard,  Volume  13,  No. 8 dated  Thursday,  11th\r\n\r\nAugust, 1960, the Prime Minister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Lui Boon Poh was educated at Batu Pahat...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I intend to carry on.

I take it that these officers\r\n\r\nnamed  were appointed as replacements of expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers;  otherwise I cannot  find  any  relevance\r\n\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Indeed, Sir, this was an\r\n\r\nexample  of  the  process  of  \"Batu  Pahatisation\"\r\n\r\nlanding  the whole administration into  a  complete\r\n\r\nmess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this gentleman, a former ex-medicine\r\n\r\nseller,  took  over  the Cleansing  Department  and\r\n\r\ndecided  that the incinerator at Kolam Ayer  served\r\n\r\nno  useful purpose, and that it was better that the\r\n\r\nrubbish  be  dumped there to sink into  the  swamp,\r\n\r\nthereby  making the ground firmer so that it  would\r\n\r\nnot  be  necessary to go to the extent of expensive\r\n\r\npiling  when you ultimately build on the site.  The\r\n\r\nresult  was  that tremendous swarms of  flies  soon\r\n\r\nplagued  the area, greatly to the distress  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents in that area. This is one of the  effects\r\n\r\nof    the   Malayanisation   programme   not   only\r\n\r\nrecommended  but  actually  carried  out   in   the\r\n\r\ndesperate days when the Member for Hong Lim  was  a\r\n\r\nMinister of the Government, The same dismal episode\r\n\r\nwas  repeated  in  all Boards and Departments  over\r\n\r\nwhich  the Member for Hong Lim had control  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  In  the  City Council, his  policy  led  not\r\n\r\nmerely  to  the resignation of expatriate  officers\r\n\r\nbut to the resignation of 38 local senior officers,\r\n\r\nmany  of  whom were persons of long experience  and\r\n\r\nspecial   technical  training.  In  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust, of which the  Member  appointed\r\n\r\nhimself  as  Chairman when he was a  Minister,  the\r\n\r\nposition  was  even worse. May I  quote  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's   account  of  what  happened   in   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust? I quote from the  same\r\n\r\nHansard (Volume 13, No. 8, dated 11th August, 1960)\r\n\r\nat column 583:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...he reduced it to near paralysis, unable to\r\n\r\nhandle  any  housing or planning  projects  of  any\r\n\r\nconsequence.

The  position is something like  this,  Sir.\r\n\r\nEight  expatriate officers resigned and, of  these,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister wanted to retain two. He told me that\r\n\r\npersonally, He said he wanted two of them. They did\r\n\r\nnot  want to stay. Ten were retrenched. Two  senior\r\n\r\nlocal officers resigned, one was retrenched, and 58\r\n\r\nlocal  junior  officers were  retrenched.  Sir,  in\r\n\r\ntheir   places  came  a  whole  host  of   personal\r\n\r\nappointees - some qualified, many unqualified. Twenty-two  others  who  took  the  place  of  the  junior\r\n\r\nretrenched  officers  were  either  unqualified  or\r\n\r\nunder-qualified. An example is Mr Lui  Boon  Phor,\r\n\r\nthe brother of the man who was told to send someone\r\n\r\nto the Pasir Panjang Power Station. Sir, he is also\r\n\r\nfrom Batu Pahat. He was appointed Chief Development\r\n\r\nOfficer. On 20th August, 1959, his salary was  $450\r\n\r\nper   month  as  Lettings  Officer.  Then  he   was\r\n\r\npromoted.  On 1st of October, 1959, his salary  was\r\n\r\n$670. Sir, apart from just being the brother of Mr\r\n\r\nLui  Boon Poh - he had a few other things to  commend\r\n\r\nhim.

(In Mandarin)\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I fully support  the  amendment\r\n\r\nmoved   by   the   Minister   for   Finance.    The\r\n\r\nMalayanisation issue raised today is  one  that  is\r\n\r\nexpected.  When the Member for Hong Lim  moved  his\r\n\r\nmotion, he was repeating what he had said before at\r\n\r\nthe  sitting in August, when he touched on  it.  At\r\n\r\nthis sitting, we clearly declared our stand on this\r\n\r\nMalayanisation issue. Mr Speaker, allow me to read\r\n\r\nout   what   the   Prime   Minister   said   about\r\n\r\nMalayanisation and our attitude towards it. Let  me\r\n\r\nquote it from the Nanyang Siang Pau of 12th August\r\n\r\n[Hansard, 11th August, 1960, col. 585].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, let me add that only a political innocent\r\n\r\nwould  still  be shouting the same old  slogan  of\r\n\r\n\"Down with white officers - Malayanisation!\" They are\r\n\r\nalready  politically down, and we can get them  out\r\n\r\nany  time  We want to. Our problem is not a  simple\r\n\r\none  of  dislodging expatriate officers... The problem\r\n\r\nnow  is how to find sufficient numbers of local men\r\n\r\nwith  the  ability  and  the  skill,  capable   and\r\n\r\nefficient, to learn quickly enough to carry out the\r\n\r\nfunctions  of the State and maintain the efficiency\r\n\r\nof the administration.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, let me repeat this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The problem now is how to find sufficient numbers\r\n\r\nof  local  men  with  the ability  and  the  skill,\r\n\r\ncapable  and efficient, to learn quickly enough  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out the functions of the State and  maintain\r\n\r\nthe efficiency of the Administration.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This    clearly   shows   our   attitude    towards\r\n\r\nMalayanisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see what is the Malayanisation policy of\r\n\r\nour first Mayor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a meeting on 30th June, 1958, he said (this\r\n\r\nwas a verbatim report) that among the 71 expatriate\r\n\r\nofficials,  only 8 must be immediately malayanised.\r\n\r\nThe  Malayanisation policy regarding the  other  63\r\n\r\nofficials was this: 5 would be guaranteed retention\r\n\r\nin  service until retirement; 16 would serve  until\r\n\r\n1st January, 1959, or retirement at 55, or optional\r\n\r\nretirement at 50; 11 would be employed  up  to  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1964, or when they wished  to  retire  on\r\n\r\nreaching  50  or  55  years of  age;  11  would  be\r\n\r\nretained  until 1st January, 1962. These  officials\r\n\r\nwould include Mr Scale and Mr Embley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Finance Minister has just now told us that\r\n\r\namong  the  administrative officers  there  are  at\r\n\r\npresent only three expatriate officers. The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong  Lim  cannot even now mention  a  fourth.\r\n\r\nAccording to this Malayanisation policy, at present\r\n\r\nthere  should be 33 remaining. As to the  technical\r\n\r\nside,   there  are  only  34  expatriate   officers\r\n\r\nremaining. According to the Malayanisation  policy,\r\n\r\nthere  should be 135 expatriate officers  remaining\r\n\r\ntoday.  From  a  comparison of  our  Malayanisation\r\n\r\nscheme  with  that of the former  Mayor's,  we  can\r\n\r\nclearly see that from what the Member for Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nhas said just now, he has not only been harping  on\r\n\r\nthe  same tune, but his speech does not hold water.\r\n\r\nHe  is  distorting facts and trying to confuse  the\r\n\r\npeople. If he is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreally interested and is in earnest, he must  raise\r\n\r\nthe  issue  with a comparison. This should  be  the\r\n\r\ncorrect attitude. Our Malayanisation policy is  not\r\n\r\nlike  his.  I remember that I touched on  the  same\r\n\r\nquestion  in this Assembly on 5th August, 1960.  It\r\n\r\nappeared  in  the Sin Chew Jit Poh  of  6th  August\r\n\r\n[Hansard, 5th August, 1960, Col. 250]. I will quote\r\n\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We can see that the thinking of the Member for\r\n\r\nHong   Lim  is  very  simple.  According   to   his\r\n\r\nunderstanding,  the so-called Malayanisation  means\r\n\r\nnot  the  substitution of capable local  people  in\r\n\r\nplace  of expatriate officers, but the substitution\r\n\r\nof  Ong  Eng Guan's people for expatriate officers.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  his way of thinking,  the  so-called\r\n\r\nMalayanisation is only \"Ong Eng Guanisation\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I have said is not to\r\n\r\ndistort  the  facts but to give the truth.  I  will\r\n\r\nmake  mention  of the so-called Mr Owen  whom  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong  Lim praised as very  worthy  and\r\n\r\ncapable.  We do not know whether he is capable  and\r\n\r\nworthy.   He  is  an  officer  responsible   to   a\r\n\r\nGovernment   Department  controlling  millions   of\r\n\r\ndollars,   and  he  has  obtained  his  accountancy\r\n\r\ncertificate  only two years ago. From this  we  can\r\n\r\nknow what the position as regards financial control\r\n\r\nin  this  department  is. It must  be  in  a  great\r\n\r\nmuddle.  The  Prime Minister in his speech  on  3rd\r\n\r\nAugust, also touched on this. It appeared  in  the\r\n\r\nNanyang   Siang  Pau.  According  to   the   former\r\n\r\nTreasurer of the Department, he had planned  for  a\r\n\r\nbudget  deficit  of  $5  million.  All  these  were\r\n\r\nrelated to the former Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this Malayanisation policy\r\n\r\nissue,  we  do not want to utilise this  chance  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up a personal empire and to consolidate  our\r\n\r\nown   position.  If  it  is  so,  then  the  person\r\n\r\nconcerned will have a pitiful future. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I believe the Member for Hong Lim will want to\r\n\r\nraise  another  issue at the next sitting  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  harping on the same tune again. Let us  hear\r\n\r\nwhat he has to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which needs clarification is this.\r\n\r\nJust  now the Member for Hong Lim touched on George\r\n\r\nThomson   concerning  the  episode  in  the   Staff\r\n\r\nTraining Centre. He said some Members were trained\r\n\r\nthere. At that time, some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers  were  wondering why this Mr  Thomson  was\r\n\r\nthere  to  brainwash  them,  and  so  many  Members\r\n\r\nwithdrew from training. This is not a fact, and  is\r\n\r\nonly an attempt to distort facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong  Lim went to a  great  extent  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  what he had said over and over again  about\r\n\r\nGeorge  Thomson,  Meadows  and  Blades.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nconcerned here with the allegations he made against\r\n\r\nthese  officers. What I am really concerned is  the\r\n\r\nmental  health  of an honour-able  Member  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He alleged that my Minister, the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture,  and I were seen at a party in  connection\r\n\r\nwith the tourist trade, and our picture appeared in\r\n\r\na  newspaper. Sir, this is the paper which  he  has\r\n\r\nreferred  to,  the  Nanyang  Siang  Pau   of   17th\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1960, page 1, \"Local News\". I was  there;\r\n\r\nso  was the Minister. Five persons appeared in  the\r\n\r\npicture,  and  the man who sat in  the  middle  was\r\n\r\nreferred  to  as Mr George Thomson.  I  could  not\r\n\r\nremember  Mr George Thomson having any  connection\r\n\r\nwith  the tourist trade. For your information, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  person  referred to as Mr George Thomson  was\r\n\r\nactually Mr J. G. C. Thomson, a partner of  Cooper\r\n\r\nBrothers  &  Company. He was the  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nPreparatory Committee of the Tourist Association. I\r\n\r\nam   really   concerned,  Mr  Speaker,   that   an\r\n\r\nhonourable  Member of this House  should  have  the\r\n\r\naudacity to produce -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I do not want to waste the time of\r\n\r\nthis  House.  This little fact alone is  enough  to\r\n\r\nprove  that our hon. Member for Hong Lim should  be\r\n\r\nmore careful when he makes further allegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take\r\n\r\nup  from where the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture left off, which is  the  key-note  of  the speeches, that is, we do not want  to\r\n\r\nwaste  the time of this House. Obviously,  whatever\r\n\r\nthe   shortcomings  of  the  former  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational Development, he must have had a purpose in\r\n\r\nmoving the motion and making the speech he did. For\r\n\r\nthe politically simple and straightforward, let  me\r\n\r\nexplain how tortuous one's thinking can become,  so\r\n\r\nthat  one  becomes completely oblivious  of  truth,\r\n\r\nprinciples,  or decency in the quest for  publicity\r\n\r\nto boost up oneself and to damage one's enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim is not concerned with the\r\n\r\ndebate  in  this House, nor with your rulings,  nor\r\n\r\nwith the vote. He knows he has to face on this side\r\n\r\nof  the House 40 sane, reasonably sober people  who\r\n\r\nhave  known him for a considerable length of  time,\r\n\r\nand who had correctly anticipated what he was going\r\n\r\nto say and what he was going to do. He is concerned\r\n\r\nwith  the  hand-outs that he is going to  give  the\r\n\r\nPress,  and  which the Press will  publish  because\r\n\r\nthey  are privileged. This is important and it  may\r\n\r\nnot be known to the public - that whatever is said in\r\n\r\nthis  House is privileged in the sense that no lie,\r\n\r\nno  libel, nothing derogatory can be the subject of\r\n\r\nan action because the Constitution ordains that the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people  freely  elected  by\r\n\r\nsecret  ballot should have only you,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Standing Orders and the sense of  decency\r\n\r\nand honour to guide them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of clarification\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There will be plenty of time\r\n\r\nfor  clarification after my speech.

But, Sir,  if  anything\r\n\r\nsaid in this Chamber which is untrue, derogatory or\r\n\r\ndefamatory is repeated outside, then the public may\r\n\r\nbe interested to know that an action for defamation\r\n\r\nand damages arising therefrom can be brought in any\r\n\r\ncourt  of law, if anything said in this Chamber  is\r\n\r\nrepeated  outside  and  an action  ensues  and  the\r\n\r\nstatement is proved to be true, then he who  brings\r\n\r\nthe  action fails and he will have to pay costs  to\r\n\r\nthe person he has brought into court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will forgive me if I have to explain this\r\n\r\nelementary  point  of law, because,  unfortunately,\r\n\r\nnot  all  people  in Singapore are acquainted  with\r\n\r\nthese technicalities. The mass effect is this. Here\r\n\r\nis the newspaper, here is the headline, and this is\r\n\r\nwhat is said. Nothing happens. It is repeated again\r\n\r\nand  again, and after some time it may be accepted.\r\n\r\nIt may be passed off as true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been nothing of substance, no argument,\r\n\r\nno facts on this motion. The facts were given by my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Minister for Finance. There are only\r\n\r\nthree   administrative  officers   left   who   are\r\n\r\nexpatriates.  There  should  have   been   30   odd\r\n\r\nofficers,  but they have left, and we are  carrying\r\n\r\non.  But that is not the point. The point is in the\r\n\r\nasides - to  do  as  much damage as possible  to  the\r\n\r\ncharacter  and reputation of those whom the  Member\r\n\r\nwants to destroy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to waste the time of this House\r\n\r\nbecause nothing of substance has been brought forth\r\n\r\nby  the  Member other than some, what I have called\r\n\r\n\"cowardly\"    but   which   you   have   overruled,\r\n\r\nallegations made against his former colleagues.  As\r\n\r\nfor  the allegations against me, Sir - that  I  am  a\r\n\r\nstooge,  the mouthpiece of an expatriate  political\r\n\r\ntheoretician,  that I am incapable of  setting  the\r\n\r\nParty line, of writing my own speeches, that  I  am\r\n\r\njust  like Mr Braga, inept, incompetent, a buffoon\r\n\r\nand a playboy, who does not know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  is  going on in his Ministry; who allows  Mr\r\n\r\nMeadows,  this  wicked, evil, British  intelligence\r\n\r\ngenius,  to  manipulate me, and Mr Blades  and  so\r\n\r\non - everyone  of those statements of  fact  and  the\r\n\r\ninferences that he sought to draw from them was  an\r\n\r\nuntruth.

But if you substitute\r\n\r\nit  with  the  word  \"untruth\", it  passes  off  as\r\n\r\nparliamentary.

We  all  have  our recollection  of  what\r\n\r\nhappened  over  the last few years since  not  just\r\n\r\n1955 - Malayanisation was an issue which started  in\r\n\r\nthe  years  after the war when, with the output  of\r\n\r\nmore and more graduates from Raffles College (as it\r\n\r\nthen  was)  and from universities abroad,  pressure\r\n\r\nmounted, to take over all these points of power  in\r\n\r\nthe  cockpit of the State. As far as the main issue\r\n\r\nwas   concerned,  it  came  to  a  head  with   the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation   Commission,  its   recommendations\r\n\r\ntherefrom,  the White Paper which was  tabled,  and\r\n\r\nthe stand which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe People's Action Party took at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problem, quite simply now, is how to get the\r\n\r\nmachinery  of  the State to function  in  the  most\r\n\r\nefficient   way.  Let  me  tell  the  great   anti-colonialist,  the self proclaimed anti-colonialist,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Hong Lim, what the  real  burning\r\n\r\nissues   are  now.  Not  to  quibble  about   three\r\n\r\nexpatriates  who  can  be  denounced,  defamed  and\r\n\r\ndismissed  at  will, since they have already  taken\r\n\r\ntheir  compensation terms and are quite safely  out\r\n\r\nof  harm's way, and who will go if at any  time  we\r\n\r\nwant  them  to  go.  The burning  issue  is,  quite\r\n\r\nsimply,  this. How do you keep this island  of  224\r\n\r\nsquare  miles  alive and viable, when its  economic\r\n\r\nexistence is controlled indirectly by companies  in\r\n\r\nLondon  and  companies  in  Kuala  Lumpur?   In   a\r\n\r\nsituation   where  numerical  and  other   logistic\r\n\r\nsuperiority  is overwhelmingly on the side  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  and  indirectly on  the  side  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish, how do you establish Singapore as part  of\r\n\r\nan independent State? For the Member's information,\r\n\r\nwe  are bringing out, in another anniversary number\r\n\r\nof  Petir, our ideological arguments and our stand-point brought up to date. And we do not require Mr\r\n\r\nGeorge  Thomson, good though he may be as a student\r\n\r\nof political science, to tell us how to analyse our\r\n\r\nown future. What I think we must do is to make sure\r\n\r\nthat  not  only  you,  Mr Speaker,  but  also  the\r\n\r\nMembers of this Assembly understand this, that  the\r\n\r\nwritten  word as published tomorrow in the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nSiang Pau, the Sin Chew fit Poh, the Utusan Melayu,\r\n\r\nthe Berita Harian, the Tamil Murasu and the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes,  will  leave no doubts in the minds  of  the\r\n\r\npeople as to what the real issues are. They are not\r\n\r\nconcerned  with Mr Owen and Mr Lui Boon  Poh  and\r\n\r\nthe aberrations of the Member for Hong Lim when  he\r\n\r\nwas   invested  with  tremendous  power.  But  they\r\n\r\nconcern the destinies and the way out for a million\r\n\r\nand  a half people living on an extremely sensitive\r\n\r\nentrep\u00f4t  economy - a  people  who  are  tremendously\r\n\r\nactive,  physically  and mentally;  a  people  who,\r\n\r\npolitically,  are  extremely  mature,   ready   and\r\n\r\nwilling to run the apparatus of an independent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState  but who are denied the where-withal. How  do\r\n\r\nwe  create  a vital economy, a situation  in  which\r\n\r\nindependence  can become a reality, an independence\r\n\r\nwhich can become the basis for a social revolution,\r\n\r\nto  create an economic system that will live up  to\r\n\r\nthe platform of a socialist party - the creation of a\r\n\r\nmore just and equal society? We do not pretend that\r\n\r\nwe are doing that, because you cannot create a more\r\n\r\njust  and equal society when you cannot change  the\r\n\r\nbasis  `of the economic system. But what we do  say\r\n\r\nis  that  we  are  providing the  people  with  the\r\n\r\nmaximum social benefits, given the limitations that\r\n\r\nare imposed on this State, not constitutionally but\r\n\r\nby  the economic facts of life. If he can think out\r\n\r\nsome of the answers to these problems, then he  can\r\n\r\nstand up and say, \"Yes, I will drive the Naval Base\r\n\r\ninto the sea, or I shall take it over and change it\r\n\r\ninto  a  commercial  dockyard. I  shall  take  over\r\n\r\nChangi  Airfield and turn it into a new Farnborough\r\n\r\nshowground for South-East Asia. I shall  take  over\r\n\r\nthe  Army  installations at  the  B.O.D. in  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang  and  turn  them  into  brigades  for   the\r\n\r\nreconstruction    and   revitalisation    of    the\r\n\r\nindependent people of Malaya.\" Tell us how  and  we\r\n\r\nshall  listen with avid ears. But if he  does  not,\r\n\r\nthen  I  say, keep up his subscriptions, if not  to\r\n\r\nthe  Party, because he is no longer a member,  then\r\n\r\nat  least  to Petir, to which he can subscribe,  in\r\n\r\norder  that  he  can  keep up  with  the  political\r\n\r\neducation  which the Party has given  him  for  all\r\n\r\nthese years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the danger of those who must have\r\n\r\nmentors. Never quarrel with your mentors, otherwise\r\n\r\nyou  go adrift. My colleagues and I are in the more\r\n\r\nfortunate position of being our own mentors. If the\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim says that that is a lie,  that\r\n\r\nit  is not true and that it is George Thomson  and\r\n\r\nBlades  and Meadows who run the government outside\r\n\r\nthis Chamber, then we will give him the time of his\r\n\r\nlife.  And I hope, Sir, he has sufficient funds  to\r\n\r\ndefray  the  whole cost of what  I  think  will  be\r\n\r\nenjoyable proceedings.

It is\r\n\r\none  thing to shout into this inert microphone,  to\r\n\r\nthe discomfiture of the ears of the Speaker - one ear\r\n\r\nof the Speaker - and to the discomfiture of the other\r\n\r\n50  hon.

It is another thing\r\n\r\nto  repeat those lies in the witness box in a calm,\r\n\r\ndispassionate  manner where every fact  has  to  be\r\n\r\nestablished or every lie has to be eaten - and  heavy\r\n\r\ndamages  paid  at  the end of it.  Either  I  am  a\r\n\r\nstooge, a fool, a half-wit, in which case I deserve\r\n\r\nto  be  called  so outside publicly;  or  he  is  a\r\n\r\nfabricator  of  untruths. Sir, I am  going  to  say\r\n\r\noutside what I think of him, and I hope he will  do\r\n\r\nlikewise  on the facts that he has stated  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  If  he  does not,  then  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore will know the worth of his motions  which\r\n\r\nwill come month by month. There is nothing new.  It\r\n\r\nis  all  in the 16 resolutions. Because it is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to think up something new when you  have\r\n\r\nnot got a mind that is prepared to be objective,  a\r\n\r\nmind  that  is  prepared to analyse, to  argue  and\r\n\r\nreason.  But  when  all you can  do  is  to  repeat\r\n\r\nmalicious  falsehoods, then I say, he is  down  the\r\n\r\nslippery slope at the end of which is perdition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon.

Sir, this is the\r\n\r\nusual way the Prime Minister has been running  this\r\n\r\ncountry  of ours for the past 16 or 17 months.  His\r\n\r\nbehaviour today is a clear manifestation of how  he\r\n\r\nruns the country - (1) Intimidation of the Press; (2)\r\n\r\nintimidation  to  take  legal  proceedings  against\r\n\r\npeople who speak against him, in the courts of law,\r\n\r\nbut not in the debates of this Assembly. Because he\r\n\r\nknows  very  well,  Mr Speaker, that  whether  the\r\n\r\nproceedings are judicial or not, he can always tear\r\n\r\npeople down. This is because he has free access  to\r\n\r\nlegal  advice, the control of the State  apparatus\r\n\r\nand, most important of all, plenty of funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister as usual in\r\n\r\nhis  debate on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech\r\n\r\ndid  not  answer  the  points I  raised  about  the\r\n\r\ncontrol    of   our   State   by   the   expatriate\r\n\r\nadministrators,  especially  by  the   three   most\r\n\r\nimportant of them. You might be wondering why I was\r\n\r\nso  patient with his interruptions just now. It was\r\n\r\nbecause  what I said was the truth except, perhaps,\r\n\r\nin a small technical matter which the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to the Minister for Culture raised  just\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He has been exposed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  not  denied  that  Mr  Thomson  has\r\n\r\nappeared  at  television sittings and on  occasions\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Prime  Minister gave lectures  to  head-masters of schools. We can also see his presence in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers every now and then until  the  June 1959  Party conference. \r\n\r\nMr Speaker, one  way  that\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister answered the charge  that  the\r\n\r\nexpatriate administrators have key\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the Government was not to  answer  the\r\n\r\ncharge,  but  to  shift the course of  argument  by\r\n\r\nshifting the basis of the argument.

The point\r\n\r\nI am submitting to you, Mr Speaker, Sir - you are as\r\n\r\nmuch  a  lawyer as anybody else in this  Chamber - is\r\n\r\nthis:  to say that a person has abused his official\r\n\r\nposition  to get benefits and jobs for his  friends\r\n\r\nis   a  very  serious  aspersion  on  the  person's\r\n\r\npersonal character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The allegation is really against the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's official character  and  that  is\r\n\r\nexactly why I have permitted this amendment  which,\r\n\r\nin  fact, is an aspersion against the character  of\r\n\r\nthe  then Minister for National Development in  his\r\n\r\nofficial  capacity. It is now alleged that  he,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   interpreted  Malayanisation  by  \"replacing\r\n\r\ncompetent  officials with unqualified  friends  and\r\n\r\nsupporters\".  That, of course, is  also  equally  a\r\n\r\nvery  serious aspersion, but that is an  allegation\r\n\r\nagainst the then Minister in his official capacity.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is permitted.

Therefore, I do not\r\n\r\nthink  that  the  time of this Assembly  should  be\r\n\r\nwasted on a debate on the Chair's ruling. As I say,\r\n\r\nI have let in a similar allegation against the then\r\n\r\nMinister  for  National Development, for  the  same\r\n\r\nreason  that  that  was an allegation  against  his\r\n\r\nconduct  in  his  official capacity.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Prime Minister ought to be content  with\r\n\r\nthat. Mr Ong Eng Guan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I always\r\n\r\nlisten  with  patience about  the  so-called  \"Batu\r\n\r\n`Pahatisation\"  without  trying  to  retaliate   by\r\n\r\nrevealing   the  exact  position  of  the   present\r\n\r\ngovernmental  structure, of  appointment  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants and of Boards and Commissions. In  today's\r\n\r\nsitting,  I only want to clarify the position  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  this particular amendment. Despite  the\r\n\r\nchallenge of the Prime Minister - not that  I  cannot\r\n\r\nquote  names and facts, but this is not within  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of my motion - I shall perhaps defer  it  to\r\n\r\nsome other date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, I do understand very well the\r\n\r\ndistinction  raised  by the  Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Malayanisation  of  a  post  and  the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation   of   an  officer.   The   previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  played  on  that  distinction  and  the\r\n\r\npresent Government is doing likewise. For instance,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  Report  of  the  Malayanisation\r\n\r\nCommission,  the  post of Public Relations  Officer\r\n\r\n(occupied  by  George  Thomson)  should  have  been\r\n\r\nMalayanised   by   1955  or  1956.   The   previous\r\n\r\nGovernment changed the post of P.R.O. and called it\r\n\r\nDirector  of Information Services; and the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment  has changed this post of D.I.S.  (which\r\n\r\nshould  be  Malayanised) to Director  of  Political\r\n\r\nTraining;  and very soon it is going to be  changed\r\n\r\nto  Professor of Political Science. It was the same\r\n\r\nwith  Mr Meadows - from Principal Assistant Director\r\n\r\nof  Social  Welfare to Director of Social  Welfare,\r\n\r\nthen  to  Deputy Permanent Secretary, and later  to\r\n\r\nSecretary  (Special Duties), and  then  he  changed\r\n\r\nback again to Deputy Permanent Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nalleged that I smeared Meadows. I have only exposed\r\n\r\na  small  fraction of what I know and of  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened  in  order to avoid giving the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  I  tried to smear him. I have nothing to  say\r\n\r\nabout    his    capabilities,    efficiency     and\r\n\r\nqualifications   as  an  officer.  The   Government\r\n\r\nBenchers  have  tried to shift the basic  issue  by\r\n\r\nsmearing a few local officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point raised by the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance   was   about  the  number  of   expatriate\r\n\r\nadministrators  in the Government service  now.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  that we have only 27 of them and that,  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact,  according to the  programme,  we\r\n\r\nshould  have  more.  But,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the State machinery does not depend  so\r\n\r\nmuch  on  the  number  of  British  officials.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in the old Government, there  were  only\r\n\r\nthree  British  Ministers compared to  six  elected\r\n\r\nMinisters;  but  I  say  that  the  three   British\r\n\r\nMinisters in the old Government exercised far  more\r\n\r\npower  than the six elected Ministers.  As  I  said\r\n\r\njust  now,  although the number of  British  police\r\n\r\nofficers   has  been  reduced  considerably,   the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the Police Force by the British  still\r\n\r\nremains,  by the system of centralisation of  power\r\n\r\nin the person of the Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in today's sitting we have seen\r\n\r\nclearly  that the Government side cannot offer  any\r\n\r\nconstructive  reply  to our  arguments.  They  have\r\n\r\nreplied by pure intimidation right from the  beginning   of  this  debate.  They  have  replied   by\r\n\r\nintimidation of the Press and of the Assembly. They\r\n\r\nhave   replied  by  shifting  the  basis  of   the\r\n\r\nargument.   They  have  not  provided  one   single\r\n\r\nconstructive reply to all the points  I  raised  in\r\n\r\nthis debate on this vital issue of Malayanisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment in taking proper steps to Malayanjse all\r\n\r\nadministrative expatriate officials in a systematic\r\n\r\nmanner  and  so  as not to repeat the  blunders  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  misinterpreted Malayanisation  to  mean\r\n\r\nreplacing   competent  officials  with  unqualified\r\n\r\nfriends and supporters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now adjourn to\r\n\r\nWednesday,  16th  November, 1960.\"-[Dr Toh Chin\r\n\r\nChye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Thirteen minutes past Seven o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Wednesday, 16th November, 1960.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1960/19601020/19601020-HA-0130821.pdf\"\">Appendix I-STREET LIGHTING IN RURAL AREAS (Cols 0821-0822)</a><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
